Preface
When we wrote the first edition of Financial Management: Theory and Practice, we had
four goals: (1) to create a text that would help students make better financial decisions;
(2) to provide a book that could be used in the introductory MBA course, but one that
was complete enough for use as a reference text in follow-on case courses and after
graduation; (3) to motivate students by demonstrating that finance is both interesting
and relevant; and (4) to make the book clear enough so that students could go through
the material without wasting either their time or their professor’s time trying to figure
out what we were saying.
The collapse of the sub-prime mortgage market, the financial crisis, and the global
economic crisis make it more important than ever for students and managers to
understand the role that finance plays in a global economy, in their own companies,
and in their own lives. So in addition to the four goals listed above, this edition has a
fifth goal, to prepare students for a changed world.
INTRINSIC VALUATION AS A UNIFYING THEME
Our emphasis throughout the book is on the actions that a manager can and should take
to increase the intrinsic value of the firm. Structuring the book around intrinsic valuation
enhances continuity and helps students see how various topics are related to one another.
As its title indicates, this book combines theory and practical applications. An
understanding of finance theory is absolutely essential for anyone developing and/or
implementing effective financial strategies. But theory alone isn’t sufficient, so we
provide numerous examples in the book and the accompanying Excel spreadsheets to
illustrate how theory is applied in practice. Indeed, we believe that the ability to ana-
lyze financial problems using Excel is absolutely essential for a student’s successful job
search and subsequent career. Therefore, many exhibits in the book come directly
from the accompanying Excel spreadsheets. Many of the spreadsheets also provide
brief “tutorials” by way of detailed comments on Excel features that we have found to
be especially useful, such as Goal Seek, Tables, and many financial functions.
The book begins with fundamental concepts, including background on the eco-
nomic and financial environment, financial statements (with an emphasis on cash
flows), the time value of money, bond valuation, risk analysis, and stock valuation.
With this background, we go on to discuss how specific techniques and decision rules
can be used to help maximize the value of the firm. This organization provides four
important advantages:
1. Managers should try to maximize the intrinsic value of a firm, which is determined
by cash flows as revealed in financial statements. Our early coverage of financial
statements thus helps students see how particular financial decisions affect the vari-
ous parts of the firm and the resulting cash flow. Also, financial statement analysis
provides an excellent vehicle for illustrating the usefulness of spreadsheets.
2. Covering time value of money early helps students see how and why expected
future cash flows determine the value of the firm. Also, it takes time for stu-
dents to digest TVM concepts and to learn how to do the required calcula-
tions, so it is good to cover TVM concepts early and often.

3. Most students—even those who do not plan to major in finance—are interested
in investments. The ability to learn is a function of individual interest and moti-
vation, so Financial Management’s early coverage of securities and security markets
is pedagogically sound.
4. Once basic concepts have been established, it is easier for students to understand
both how and why corporations make specific decisions in the areas of capital
budgeting, raising capital, working capital management, mergers, and the like.
INTENDED MARKET AND USE
Financial Management is designed primarily for use in the introductory MBA finance
course and as a reference text in follow-on case courses and after graduation. There is
enough material for two terms, especially if the book is supplemented with cases and/or
selected readings. The book can also be used as an undergraduate introductory text with
exceptionally good students, or where the introductory course is taught over two terms.
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE 13
TH EDITION
As in every revision, we updated and clarified materials throughout the text, reviewing
the entire book for completeness, ease of exposition, and currency. We made hundreds
of small changes to keep the text up-to-date, with particular emphasis on updating the
real world examples and including the latest changes in the financial environment and
financial theory. In addition, we made a number of larger changes. Some affect all chap-
ters, some involve reorganizing sections among chapters, and some modify material
covered within specific chapters.
CHANGES THAT AFFECT ALL CHAPTERS
Reorganization
to
better accommodate
one-semester
and two-semester
sequences. Finance is taught as a one-semester course at many schools, so we moved
the essential material into the first 17 chapters. The remaining chapters cover addi-
tional topics and provide more advanced treatment of the essential material in the first
17 chapters. This makes it easy for a professor teaching a one-semester course to cover
the essential materials and then pick and choose from the remaining topics if time per-
mits. If finance is taught in a two-semester sequence, the first semester can focus on
the essential materials in the first 17 chapters and the second semester can focus on
advanced materials in the remaining chapters, perhaps supplemented with cases.
The global economic crisis. In virtually every chapter we use real world examples
to show how the chapter’s topics are related to some aspect of the global economic
crisis. In addition, many chapters have new “Global Economic Crisis” boxes that fo-
cus on particularly important issues related to the crisis.
The big picture. Students often fail to see the forest for the trees, and this is espe-
cially true in finance because students must learn new vocabularies and analytical
tools. To help students understand the big picture and integrate the different parts
into an overall framework, we have added a graphic at the beginning of each chap-
ter (and in the PowerPoint shows) that clearly illustrates where the chapter’s topics
fit into the big picture. Following is an example from Chapter 9:

Additional integration of the textbook and the accompanying Excel Tool Kit
spreadsheet models for each chapter. Many figures in the textbook are actually
screen shots from the chapter’s Excel Tool Kit model. This makes the analysis more
transparent to the students and better enables them to follow the analysis in the Excel
model.
Signficant Reorganization of Some Chapters
Financial markets and performance measures. Chapter 1 still addresses the
financial environment, but now is followed by two chapters focused on measuring
the firm’s performance in the financial environment by understanding financial state-
ments, calculating free cash flow, and analyzing ratios.
Time value of money and bond valuation. Chapter 4 covers the time value of
money and Chapter 5 applies these concepts to bond pricing. Thus, students learn a
tool and then immediately use the tool.
Dividends and stock repurchases before capital structure decisions. We now
cover dividends and stock repurchases in Chapter 14 so that students will already un-
derstand stock repurchases when we discuss recapitalizations in Chapter 15.
Notable Changes within Selected Chapters
We made too many small improvements within each chapter to mention them all,
but some of the more notable ones are discussed below.
Chapter 1: An Overview of Financial Management and the Financial
Environment. We added a new box on globalization, “Columbus Was Wrong—
Preface
xxi

the World Is Flat! And Hot, and Crowded,” and a new box on the global economic
crisis, “Say Hello to the Global Economic Crisis!” We completely rewrote the sec-
tion on financial securities, including a discussion of securitization, and added a new
section on the global crisis. New figures showing the national debt, trade balances,
federal budget deficits and the Case-Shiller real estate index help us better illustrate
different aspects of the global crisis.
Chapter 2: Financial Statements, Cash Flow, and Taxes. A new opening vi-
gnette shows the cash that several different companies generated and the different ways
that they used the cash flow. We added a new box on the global economic crisis that
explains the problems associates with off-balance-sheet assets, “Let’s Play Hide-
and-Seek!” We added a new figure illustrating the uses of free cash flow. We now have
two end-of-chapter spreadsheet problems, one focusing on the articulation between the
income statement and statement of cash flows, and one focusing on free cash flow.
Chapter 3: Analysis of Financial Statements. We added a new box on marking
to market, “The Price is Right! (Or Wrong!),” and a new box on international ac-
counting standards, “The World Might be Flat, but Global Accounting is Bumpy!
The Case of IFRS versus FASB.” We have included discussion of the price/EBITDA
ratio, gross profit margin, and operating profit margin; we also explain how to use
the statement of cash flows in financial analysis.
Chapter 4: Time Value of Money. We added three new boxes: (1) “Hints on
Using Financial Calculators,” (2) “Variable Annuities: Good or Bad?”, and (3) “An
Accident Waiting to Happen: Option Reset Adjustable Rate Mortgages.”
Chapter 5: Bonds, Bond Valuation, and Interest Rates. We added four new
boxes related to the global economic crisis: (1) “Betting With or Against the U.S.
Government: The Case of Treasury Bond Credit Default Swaps,” (2) “Insuring
with Credit Default Swaps: Let the Buyer Beware!” (3) “Might the U.S. Treasury
Bond Be Downgraded?” and (4) “Are Investors Rational?” We also added a new table
summarizing corporate bond default rates and annual changes in ratings.
Chapter 6: Risk, Return, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The new open-
ing vignette discusses the recent stock market and compares the market’s returns to GE’s
returns. We added a new box on the risk that remains even for long-term investors,
“What Does Risk Really Mean?” We added two additional boxes on risk, “How Risky
Is a Large Portfolio of Stocks?” and “Another Kind of Risk: The Bernie Madoff Story.”
Chapter 7: Stocks, Stock Valuation, and Stock Market Equilibrium. A new
opening vignette discusses buy- and sell-side analysts. We added a new box on be-
havioral issues, “Rational Behavior vs. Animal Spirits, Herding, and Anchoring
Bias.” We added a new section, “The Market Stock Price vs. Intrinsic Value.”
Chapter 8: Financial Options and Applications in Corporate Finance. We
completely rewrote the description of the binomial option pricing model. In addition
to the hedge portfolio, we also discuss replicating portfolios. We now provide the
binomial formula and we show the complete solution to the 2-period model. To pro-
vide greater continuity, the company used to illustrate the binomial example is now
the same company used to illustrate the Black-Scholes model. Our discussion of put
options now includes the Black-Scholes put formula.
Chapter 9: The Cost of Capital. We added a new figure to highlight the similari-
ties and differences among capital structure weights based on book values, market
xxii
Preface

values, and target values. We added a new box, “GE and Warren Buffett: The Cost
of Preferred Stock.” We completely rewrote our discussion of the market risk pre-
mium, which now includes the impact of stock repurchases on estimating the market
risk premium. We also present data from surveys identifying the market risk premia
used by CFOs and professors.
Chapter 10: The Basics of Capital Budgeting: Evaluating Cash Flows. We
added a new box, “Why NPV is Better than IRR.”
Chapter 11: Cash Flow Estimation and Risk Analysis. We now show how to
use tornado diagrams in sensitivity analysis. We rewrote our discussion of Monte
Carlo simulation and show how to conduct a simulation analysis without using add-
ins but instead using only Excel’s built-in features (Data Tables and random number
generators). We have included an example of replacement analysis and an example of
a decision tree showing abandonment. We added a new box, “Are Bank Stress Tests
Stressful Enough?”
Chapter 12: Financial Planning and Forecasting Financial Statements. It is
difficult to do financial planning without using spreadsheet software, so we
completely rewrote the chapter and explicitly integrated the text and the Excel Tool
Kit model. We illustrate the ways that financial policies (i.e., dividend payout and
capital structure choices) affect financial projections, including ways to ensure that
balance sheets balance. The Excel Tool Kit model now shows a very simple way to
incorporate financing feedback effects.
Chapter 13: Corporate Valuation, Value-Based Management, and Corporate
Governance. The new opening vignette discusses the role of corporate governance in
the global economic crisis. We also added three new boxes. The first describes corpo-
rate governance issues at IBM, “Let’s Go to Miami! IBM’s 2009 Annual Meeting.”
The second discusses leadership at bailout recipients, “Would the U.S. Government
be an Effective Board Director?” The third discusses the 2009 proxy season, “Share-
holder Reactions to the Crisis.”
Chapter 14: Distributions to Shareholders: Dividends and Repurchases. We
consolidated the coverage of stock repurchases that had been spread over two chapters and
located it here, which now precedes our discussion of capital structure in Chapter 15. We
also use the FCF valuation model to illustrate the different impacts of stock repurchases
versus dividend payments. We added two new boxes. The first discusses recent dividend
cuts, “Will Dividends Ever Be the Same?” and the second discusses Sun Microsystem’s
stock splits and recent reverse split, “Talk About a Split Personality!”
Chapter 15: Capital Structure Decisions. The new opening vignette discusses re-
cent bankruptcies and Black & Decker efforts to reduce liquidity risk by refinancing
short-term debt with long-term debt. Because the stock repurchases are now covered
in the preceding chapter, we were able to improve our discussion of recapitalizations
within the context of the FCF valuation model. We added a new box, “Deleveraging”
that discusses the changes in leverage many companies and individuals are making in
light of the global economic crisis.
Chapter 16: Working Capital Management. We reorganized the chapter so
that we now discuss working capital holdings and financing before discussing
the cash conversion cycle. We rewrote our coverage of the cash conversion cycle to
explain the general concepts and then apply them to actual financial statement data.
Preface
xxiii

We added the box “Some Firms Operate with Negative Working Capital!” and a
new section on the cost of cost of bank loans.
Chapter 17: Multinational Financial Management. We added a new opening
vignette on the global economic crisis and its impact on world economies, foreign
direct investment, and cross-border M&As. We added two new boxes, the first on
regulating international bribery and taxation, “Greasing the Wheels of International
Business.” The second new box discusses the wave of foreign companies partnering
with Chinese banks to provide consumer finance services, “Consumer Finance in
China.”
Chapter 18: Lease Financing. The new opening vignette discusses Virgin Atlan-
tic’s order of 10 Airbus jets to be leased from AerCap. A new box addresses the
FASB/IASB movement to capitalize all leases, “Off-Balance Sheet Financing: Is it
Going to Disappear?”
Chapter 19: Hybrid Financing: Preferred Stock, Warrants, and Convertibles.
The new opening vignette discusses the Treasury Department’s use of preferred stock
and warrants to support troubled companies. A new box discusses the use of payment-
in-kind preferred stock in the merger of Dow Chemical Company and Rohm & Haas,
“The Romance Had No Chemistry, But It Had a Lot of Preferred Stock!”
Chapter 20: Initial Public Offerings, Investment Banking, and Financial
Restructuring. The new opening vignette discusses three companies that recently
raised capital via an initial public offering, a seasoned stock offering, and a debt offer-
ing. We added a new section on investment banking activities. We added a new box
on “Investment Banks and the Global Economic Crisis.”
Chapter 21: Mergers, LBOs, Divestitures, and Holding Companies. We
added a section explaining how the stock-swap ratio is determined for mergers where
the payment is in the form of the acquiring company’s stock.
Chapter 22: Bankruptcy, Reorganization, and Liquidation. The new opening
vignette discusses the bankruptcies of Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual, Chrys-
ler, and General Motors. We added a new box on personal and small business bank-
ruptcies, “A Nation of Defaulters?”.
Chapter 23: Derivatives and Risk Management. The new opening vignette
discusses risk management at Koch Industries, Navistar, and Pepsi. We added a new
box on “Value at Risk and Enterprise Risk Management.” Throughout the chapter
we discuss the failure of risk management during the global economic crisis.
Chapter 24: Portfolio Theory, Asset Pricing Models, and Behavioral
Finance. We added a box on the WSJ contest between dart-throwers and investors,
“Skill or Luck?”. We expanded our discussion of the Fama-French 3-factor model and
included a table showing returns of portfolios formed by sorting on size and the book-
to-market ratio.
Chapter 25: Real Options. The new opening vignette discusses Honda’s flexible
manufacturing plants.

The Cengage Global Economic Watch (GEW) Resource Center. This is your
source for turning today’s challenges into tomorrow’s solutions. This online portal,
available for free when bundled with the text, houses the most current and up-
to-date content concerning the economic crisis. Organized by discipline, the GEC
Resource Center offers the solutions instructors and students need in an easy-to-use
format. Included are an overview and timeline of the historical events leading up to
the crisis; links to the latest news and resources; discussion and testing content; an
instructor feedback forum; and a Global Issues Database.
Study Guide. This supplement outlines the key sections of each chapter, and it
provides students with a set of questions and problems similar to those in the text
and in the Test Bank, along with worked-out solutions. Instructors seldom use the
Study Guide themselves, but students often find it useful, so we recommend that
instructors ask their bookstores to have copies available. Our bookstores generally
have to reorder it, which attests to its popularity with students.
In addition to these printed resources and the items noted above, many other
resources are available on the Web at Financial Management’s Web site. These ancil-
laries include:

Preface

Excel Tool Kits. Proficiency with spreadsheets is an absolute necessity for all MBA
students. With this in mind, we created Excel spreadsheets, called “Tool Kits,” for each
chapter to show how the calculations used in the chapter were actually done. The
Tool Kit models include explanations and screen shots that show students how to use
many of the features and functions of Excel, enabling the Tool Kits to serve as self-
taught tutorials.
An e-Library: Web Extensions and Web Chapters. Many chapters have Adobe
PDF “appendices” that provide more detailed coverage of topics that were addressed
in the chapter. In addition, these four specialized topics are covered in PDF web
chapters: Banking Relationships, Working Capital Management Extensions, Pension
Plan Management, and Financial Management in Not-for-Profit Businesses.
End-of-Chapter Spreadsheet Problems. Each chapter has a “Build a Model” prob-
lem, where students start with a spreadsheet that contains financial data plus general
instructions relating to solving a specific problem. The model is partially completed,
with headings but no formulas, so the student must literally build a model. This struc-
ture guides the student through the problem, minimizes unnecessary typing and data
entry, and also makes it easy to grade the work, since all students’ answers are in the
same locations on the spreadsheet. The partial spreadsheets for the “Build a Model”
problems are available to students on the book’s Web site, while the completed models
are in files on the Instructor’s portion of the Web site.
Thomson ONE—BSE Problem Sets. The book’s Web site has a set of problems
that require accessing the Thomson ONE—Business School Edition Web data.
Using real world data, students are better able to develop the skills they will need in
the real world.
Interactive Study Center. The textbook’s Web site contains links to all Web sites
that are cited in each chapter.
Course Management Tools Available only to Instructors
Instructors have access to all of the materials listed above, plus additional course manage-
ment tools. These are available at Financial Management’s Instructor companion Web site
and on the Instructor’s Resource CD. These materials include:
Solutions Manual. This comprehensive manual contains worked-out solutions to
all end-of-chapter materials. It is available in both print and electronic forms at the
Instructor’s Web site.
PowerPoint Slides. There is a Mini Case at the end of each chapter. These cases
cover all the essential issues presented in the chapter, and they provide the structure
for our class lectures. For each Mini Case, we developed a set of PowerPoint slides
that present graphs, tables, lists, and calculations for use in lectures. Although based
on the Mini Cases, the slides are completely self-contained in the sense that they can
be used for lectures regardless of whether students are required to read the mini
cases. Also, instructors can easily customize the slides, and they can be converted
quickly into any PowerPoint Design Template.1 Copies of these files are on the Instruc-
tor’s Web site.
1To convert into PowerPoint, select Format, Apply Design Template, and then pick any template. Always
double-check the conversion; some templates use differently sized fonts, which can cause some slide titles
to run over their allotted space.

Mini Case Spreadsheets. In addition to the PowerPoint slides, we also provide Excel
spreadsheets that do the calculations required in the Mini Cases. These spreadsheets
are similar to the Tool Kits except (a) the numbers correspond to the Mini Cases
rather than the chapter examples, and (b) we added some features that make it possi-
ble to do what-if analysis on a real-time basis in class. We usually begin our lectures
with the PowerPoint presentation, but after we have explained a basic concept we
“toggle” to the mini case Excel file and show how the analysis can be done in Excel.2
For example, when teaching bond pricing, we begin with the PowerPoint show and
cover the basic concepts and calculations. Then we toggle to Excel and use a
sensitivity-based graph to show how bond prices change as interest rates and time
to maturity vary. More and more students are bringing their laptops to class, and
they can follow along, doing the what-if analysis for themselves.
Solutions to End-of-Chapter Spreadsheet Problems. The partial spreadsheets
for the “Build a Model” problems are available to students, while the completed mod-
els are in files on the Instructor’s Web site.
Solutions to Thomson ONE—BSE Problem Sets. The Thomson ONE—BSE
problems set require students to use real world data. Although the solutions change
daily as the data change, we provide instructors with “representative” answers.
Test Bank. The Test Bank contains more than 1,200 class-tested questions and pro-
blems. Information regarding the topic and degree of difficulty, along with the com-
plete solution for all numerical problems, is provided with each question. The Test
Bank is available in three forms: (1) in a printed book; (2) in Microsoft Word files;
and (3) in a computerized test bank software package, Exam View, which has many
features that make test preparation, scoring, and grade recording easy, including the
ability to generate different versions of the same problem. Exam View is easily able
to export pools into Blackboard and WebCT.
Textchoice, the Cengage Learning Online Case Library. More than 100 cases
written by Eugene F. Brigham, Linda Klein, and Chris Buzzard are now available via
the Internet, and new cases are added every year. These cases are in a database that
allows instructors to select cases and create their own customized casebooks. Most of
the cases have accompanying spreadsheet models that, while not essential for working
the case, do reduce number crunching and thus leave more time for students to con-
sider conceptual issues. The models also illustrate how computers can be used to
make better financial decisions. Cases that we have found particularly useful for the
different chapters are listed in the end-of-chapter references. The cases, case solu-
tions, and spreadsheet models can be previewed and ordered by instructors at
http://www.textchoice2.com.

Preface

ERRORS IN THE TEXT
At this point, authors generally say something like this: “We appreciate all the help
we received from the people listed above, but any remaining errors are, of course,
our own responsibility.” And in many books, there are plenty of remaining errors.
Having experienced difficulties with errors ourselves, both as students and as
instructors, we resolved to avoid this problem in Financial Management. As a result
of our error detection procedures, we are convinced that the book is relatively free
of mistakes.
Partly because of our confidence that few such errors remain, but primarily
because we want to detect any errors in the textbook that may have slipped by
so we can correct them in subsequent printings, we decided to offer a reward of
$10 per error to the first person who reports a textbook error to us. For purposes
of this reward, errors in the textbook are defined as misspelled words, nonround-
ing numerical errors, incorrect statements, and any other error that inhibits com-
prehension. Typesetting problems such as irregular spacing and differences in
opinion regarding grammatical or punctuation conventions do not qualify for
this reward. Also, given the ever-changing nature of the Internet, changes in
Web addresses do not qualify as errors, although we would appreciate reports
of changed Web addresses. Finally, any qualifying error that has follow-through
effects is counted as two errors only. Please report any errors to Michael C.
Ehrhardt at the e-mail address given below.
CONCLUSION
Finance is, in a real sense, the cornerstone of the free enterprise system. Good finan-
cial management is therefore vitally important to the economic health of business
firms, hence to the nation and the world. Because of its importance, corporate finance
should be thoroughly understood. However, this is easier said than done—the field is
relatively complex, and it is undergoing constant change in response to shifts in eco-
nomic conditions. All of this makes corporate finance stimulating and exciting, but
also challenging and sometimes perplexing. We sincerely hope that Financial Manage-
ment: Theory and Practice will help readers understand and solve the financial problems
faced by businesses today.

An Overview of Financial
Management and the
Financial Environment
In a global beauty contest for companies, the winner is … Apple.
Or at least Apple is the most admired company in the world, according
to Fortune magazine’s annual survey. The others in the global top ten are
Berkshire Hathaway, Toyota, Google, Johnson & Johnson, Procter &
Gamble, FedEx, Southwest Airlines, General Electric, and Microsoft. What
do these companies have that separates them from the rest of the pack?
According to a survey of executives, directors, and security analysts,
these companies have very high average scores across nine attributes:
(1) innovativeness, (2) quality of management, (3) long-term investment value,
(4) social responsibility, (5) employee talent, (6) quality of products and services,
(7) financial soundness, (8) use of corporate assets, and (9) effectiveness in
doing business globally. After culling weaker companies, the final rankings are
then determined by over 3,700 experts from a wide variety of industries.
What do these companies have in common? First, they have an
incredible focus on using technology to understand their customers, reduce
costs, reduce inventory, and speed up product delivery. Second, they
continually innovate and invest in ways to differentiate their products. Some
are known for game-changing products, such as Apple’s touch screen iPhone
or Toyota’s hybrid Prius. Others continually introduce small improvements,
such as Southwest Airline’s streamlined boarding procedures.
In addition to their acumen with technology and customers, they are
also on the leading edge when it comes to training employees and
providing a workplace in which people can thrive.
In a nutshell, these companies reduce costs by having innovative
production processes, they create value for customers by providing high-
quality products and services, and they create value for employees by
training and fostering an environment that allows employees to utilize all
of their skills and talents.
Do investors benefit from this focus on processes, customers, and
employees? During the most recent 5-year period, these ten companies
posted an average annual stock return of 6.9%, which is not too shabby
when compared with the −4.1% average annual return of the S&P 500.
These superior returns are due to superior cash flow generation. But, as
you will see throughout this book, a company can generate cash flow only
if it also creates value for its customers, employees, and suppliers.

This chapter should give you an idea of what financial management is all about, in-
cluding an overview of the financial markets in which corporations operate. Before
going into details, let’s look at the big picture. You’re probably in school because
you want an interesting, challenging, and rewarding career. To see where finance
fits in, here’s a five-minute MBA.
1.1 THE FIVE-MINUTE MBA
Okay, we realize you can’t get an MBA in five minutes. But just as an artist quickly
sketches the outline of a picture before filling in the details, we can sketch the key
elements of an MBA education. The primary objective of an MBA program is to pro-
vide managers with the knowledge and skills they need to run successful companies,
so we start our sketch with some common characteristics of successful companies. In
particular, all successful companies are able to accomplish two main goals:
1. All successful companies identify, create, and deliver products or services that are
highly valued by customers—so highly valued that customers choose to purchase
from them rather than from their competitors.
2. All successful companies sell their products/services at prices that are high en-
ough to cover costs and to compensate owners and creditors for the use of their
money and their exposure to risk.
It’s easy to talk about satisfying customers and investors, but it’s not so easy to ac-
complish these goals. If it were, then all companies would be successful, and you
wouldn’t need an MBA!
The Key Attributes of Successful Companies
First, successful companies have skilled people at all levels inside the company, including
leaders, managers, and a capable workforce.
Second, successful companies have strong relationships with groups outside the com-
pany. For example, successful companies develop win–win relationships with suppli-
ers and excel in customer relationship management.
Third, successful companies have enough funding to execute their plans and support
their operations. Most companies need cash to purchase land, buildings, equipment,
and materials. Companies can reinvest a portion of their earnings, but most growing
companies must also raise additional funds externally by some combination of selling
stock and/or borrowing in the financial markets.
Just as a stool needs all three legs to stand, a successful company must have all
three attributes: skilled people, strong external relationships, and sufficient capital.
The MBA, Finance, and Your Career
To be successful, a company must meet its first main goal: identifying, creating, and
delivering highly valued products and services to its customers. This requires that it
possess all three of the key attributes mentioned above. Therefore, it’s not surprising
that most of your MBA courses are directly related to these attributes. For example,
courses in economics, communication, strategy, organizational behavior, and human
resources should prepare you for a leadership role and enable you to effectively man-
age your company’s workforce. Other courses, such as marketing, operations man-
agement,
and
information
technology,
increase
your
knowledge
of
specific
disciplines, enabling you to develop the efficient business processes and strong exter-
nal relationships your company needs. Portions of this finance course will address

raising the capital your company needs to implement its plans. In short, your MBA
courses will give you the skills you need to help a company achieve its first goal: pro-
ducing goods and services that customers want.
Recall, though, that it’s not enough just to have highly valued products and satis-
fied customers. Successful companies must also meet their second main goal, which is
generating enough cash to compensate the investors who provided the necessary cap-
ital. To help your company accomplish this second goal, you must be able to evaluate
any proposal, whether it relates to marketing, production, strategy, or any other area,
and implement only the projects that add value for your investors. For this, you must
have expertise in finance, no matter your major. Thus, finance is a critical part of an
MBA education, and it will help you throughout your career.

1.2 THE CORPORATE LIFE CYCLE
Many major corporations, including Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard, began
life in a garage or basement. How is it possible for such companies to grow into the
giants we see today? No two companies develop in exactly the same way, but the fol-
lowing sections describe some typical stages in the corporate life cycle.
Starting Up as a Proprietorship
Many companies begin as a proprietorship, which is an unincorporated business
owned by one individual. Starting a business as a proprietor is easy—one merely be-
gins business operations after obtaining any required city or state business licenses.
The proprietorship has three important advantages: (1) it is easily and inexpensively
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
Say Hello to the Global Economic Crisis!
Imagine a story of greed and reckless daring, of for-
tunes made and fortunes lost, of enormous corpora-
tions failing and even governments brought to the
brink of ruin. No, this isn’t a box-office blockbuster,
but instead is the situation facing the world’s financial
markets and economies as we write this in mid-2009.
What exactly is the crisis? At the risk of oversimplifi-
cation, many of the world’s individuals, financial institu-
tions, and governments borrowed too much money
and used those borrowed funds to make speculative in-
vestments. As those investments are turning out to be
worth less than the amounts owed by the borrowers,
widespread bankruptcies, buyouts, and restructurings
for both borrowers and lenders are occurring. This in
turn is reducing the supply of available funds that finan-
cial institutions normally lend to creditworthy indivi-
duals, manufacturers, and retailers. Without access to
credit, consumers are buying less, manufacturers are
producing less, and retailers are selling less—all of
which leads to layoffs. Because of falling consumption,
shrinking production, and higher unemployment, the
National Bureau of Economic Research declared that
the United States entered a recession in December
2007. In fact, this is a global downturn, and most econ-
omists expect it to be severe and lengthy.
As we progress through this chapter and the rest of
the book, we will discuss different aspects of the crisis.

formed, (2) it is subject to few government regulations, and (3) its income is not sub-
ject to corporate taxation but is taxed as part of the proprietor’s personal income.
However, the proprietorship also has three important limitations: (1) it may be
difficult for a proprietorship to obtain the capital needed for growth; (2) the proprie-
tor has unlimited personal liability for the business’s debts, which can result in losses
that exceed the money invested in the company (creditors may even be able to seize a
proprietor’s house or other personal property!); and (3) the life of a proprietorship is
limited to the life of its founder. For these three reasons, sole proprietorships are
used primarily for small businesses. In fact, proprietorships account for only about
13% of all sales, based on dollar values, even though about 80% of all companies are
proprietorships.
More Than One Owner: A Partnership
Some companies start with more than one owner, and some proprietors decide to
add a partner as the business grows. A partnership exists whenever two or more per-
sons or entities associate to conduct a noncorporate business for profit. Partnerships
may operate under different degrees of formality, ranging from informal, oral under-
standings to formal agreements filed with the secretary of the state in which the part-
nership was formed. Partnership agreements define the ways any profits and losses
are shared between partners. A partnership’s advantages and disadvantages are gener-
ally similar to those of a proprietorship.
Regarding liability, the partners can potentially lose all of their personal assets,
even assets not invested in the business, because under partnership law, each partner
is liable for the business’s debts. Therefore, in the event the partnership goes bank-
rupt, if any partner is unable to meet his or her pro rata liability then the remaining
partners must make good on the unsatisfied claims, drawing on their personal assets
to the extent necessary. To avoid this, it is possible to limit the liabilities of some of
the partners by establishing a limited partnership, wherein certain partners are des-
ignated general partners and others limited partners. In a limited partnership, the
limited partners can lose only the amount of their investment in the partnership,
Columbus Was Wrong—the World Is Flat! And Hot, and Crowded!
In his best-selling book The World Is Flat, Thomas L.
Friedman argues that many of the barriers that long
protected
businesses
and
employees
from
global
competition have been broken down by dramatic im-
provements in communication and transportation tech-
nologies. The result is a level playing field that spans
the entire world. As we move into the information age,
any work that can be digitized will flow to those able to
do it at the lowest cost, whether they live in San Jose’s
Silicon Valley or Bangalore, India. For physical pro-
ducts, supply chains now span the world. For example,
raw materials might be extracted in South America, fab-
ricated into electronic components in Asia, and then
used in computers assembled in the United States,
with the final product being sold in Europe.
Similar changes are occurring in the financial mar-
kets, as capital flows across the globe to those who
can best use it. Indeed, China raised more money
through initial public offerings than any other country
in 2006, and the euro is becoming the currency of
choice for denominating global bond issues.
Unfortunately, a dynamic world can bring runaway
growth, which can lead to significant environmental
problems and energy shortages. Friedman describes
these problems in another bestseller, Hot, Flat, and
Crowded. In a flat world, the keys to success are knowl-
edge, skills, and a great work ethic. In a flat, hot, and
crowded world, these factors must be combined with
innovation and creativity to deal with truly global
problems.

Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

while the general partners have unlimited liability. However, the limited partners
typically have no control—it rests solely with the general partners—and their returns
are likewise limited. Limited partnerships are common in real estate, oil, equipment
leasing ventures, and venture capital. However, they are not widely used in general
business situations because usually no one partner is willing to be the general partner
and thus accept the majority of the business’s risk, and none of the others are willing
to be limited partners and give up all control.
In both regular and limited partnerships, at least one partner is liable for the debts
of the partnership. However, in a limited liability partnership (LLP), sometimes
called a limited liability company (LLC), all partners enjoy limited liability with re-
gard to the business’s liabilities, and their potential losses are limited to their invest-
ment in the LLP. Of course, this arrangement increases the risk faced by an LLP’s
lenders, customers, and suppliers.
Many Owners: A Corporation
Most partnerships have difficulty attracting substantial amounts of capital. This is
generally not a problem for a slow-growing business, but if a business’s products or
services really catch on, and if it needs to raise large sums of money to capitalize on
its opportunities, then the difficulty in attracting capital becomes a real drawback.
Thus, many growth companies, such as Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, began life
as a proprietorship or partnership, but at some point their founders decided to con-
vert to a corporation. On the other hand, some companies, in anticipation of growth,
actually begin as corporations. A corporation is a legal entity created under state
laws, and it is separate and distinct from its owners and managers. This separation
gives the corporation three major advantages: (1) unlimited life—a corporation can
continue after its original owners and managers are deceased; (2) easy transferability
of ownership interest—ownership interests are divided into shares of stock, which can
be transferred far more easily than can proprietorship or partnership interests; and
(3) limited liability—losses are limited to the actual funds invested.
To illustrate limited liability, suppose you invested $10,000 in a partnership that
then went bankrupt and owed $1 million. Because the owners are liable for the
debts of a partnership, you could be assessed for a share of the company’s debt,
and you could be held liable for the entire $1 million if your partners could not
pay their shares. On the other hand, if you invested $10,000 in the stock of a cor-
poration that went bankrupt, your potential loss on the investment would be lim-
ited to your $10,000 investment.1 Unlimited life, easy transferability of ownership
interest, and limited liability make it much easier for corporations than proprietor-
ships or partnerships to raise money in the financial markets and grow into large
companies.
The corporate form offers significant advantages over proprietorships and part-
nerships, but it also has two disadvantages: (1) Corporate earnings may be subject to
double taxation—the earnings of the corporation are taxed at the corporate level, and
then earnings paid out as dividends are taxed again as income to the stockholders. (2)
Setting up a corporation involves preparing a charter, writing a set of bylaws, and
filing the many required state and federal reports, which is more complex and time-
consuming than creating a proprietorship or a partnership.
The charter includes the following information: (1) name of the proposed corpo-
ration, (2) types of activities it will pursue, (3) amount of capital stock, (4) number of
1In the case of very small corporations, the limited liability may be fiction because lenders frequently re-
quire personal guarantees from the stockholders.

directors, and (5) names and addresses of directors. The charter is filed with the sec-
retary of the state in which the firm will be incorporated, and when it is approved,
the corporation is officially in existence.2 After the corporation begins operating,
quarterly and annual employment, financial, and tax reports must be filed with state
and federal authorities.
The bylaws are a set of rules drawn up by the founders of the corporation. In-
cluded are such points as (1) how directors are to be elected (all elected each year
or perhaps one-third each year for 3-year terms); (2) whether the existing stock-
holders will have the first right to buy any new shares the firm issues; and (3) proce-
dures for changing the bylaws themselves, should conditions require it.
There are actually several different types of corporations. Professionals such as
doctors, lawyers, and accountants often form a professional corporation (PC) or a
professional association (PA). These types of corporations do not relieve the parti-
cipants of professional (malpractice) liability. Indeed, the primary motivation behind
the professional corporation was to provide a way for groups of professionals to in-
corporate and thus avoid certain types of unlimited liability yet still be held responsi-
ble for professional liability.
Finally, if certain requirements are met, particularly with regard to size and num-
ber of stockholders, owners can establish a corporation but elect to be taxed as if the
business were a proprietorship or partnership. Such firms, which differ not in organi-
zational form but only in how their owners are taxed, are called S corporations.
Growing and Managing a Corporation
Once a corporation has been established, how does it evolve? When entrepreneurs
start a company, they usually provide all the financing from their personal resources,
which may include savings, home equity loans, or even credit cards. As the corpora-
tion grows, it will need factories, equipment, inventory, and other resources to sup-
port its growth. In time, the entrepreneurs usually deplete their own resources and
must turn to external financing. Many young companies are too risky for banks, so
the founders must sell stock to outsiders, including friends, family, private investors
(often called angels), or venture capitalists. If the corporation continues to grow, it
may become successful enough to attract lending from banks, or it may even raise
additional funds through an initial public offering (IPO) by selling stock to the
public at large. After an IPO, corporations support their growth by borrowing from
banks, issuing debt, or selling additional shares of stock. In short, a corporation’s
ability to grow depends on its interactions with the financial markets, which we de-
scribe in much more detail later in this chapter.
For proprietorships, partnerships, and small corporations, the firm’s owners are
also its managers. This is usually not true for a large corporation, which means that
large firms’ stockholders, who are its owners, face a serious problem. What is to pre-
vent managers from acting in their own best interests, rather than in the best inter-
ests of the stockholder/owners? This is called an agency problem, because managers
are hired as agents to act on behalf of the owners. Agency problems can be addressed
by a company’s corporate governance, which is the set of rules that control the
company’s behavior towards its directors, managers, employees, shareholders, cred-
itors, customers, competitors, and community. We will have much more to say about

1.3 THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE CORPORATION:
VALUE MAXIMIZATION
Shareholders are the owners of a corporation, and they purchase stocks because they
want to earn a good return on their investment without undue risk exposure. In most
cases, shareholders elect directors, who then hire managers to run the corporation on
a day-to-day basis. Because managers are supposed to be working on behalf of share-
holders, they should pursue policies that enhance shareholder value. Consequently,
throughout this book we operate on the assumption that management’s primary ob-
jective is stockholder wealth maximization.
The market price is the stock price that we observe in the financial markets. We
later explain in detail how stock prices are determined, but for now it is enough to say
that a company’s market price incorporates the information available to investors. If
the market price reflects all relevant information, then the observed price is also the
intrinsic, or fundamental, price. However, investors rarely have all relevant informa-
tion. For example, companies report most major decisions, but they sometimes withhold
selected information to prevent competitors from gaining strategic advantages.
Unfortunately, some managers deliberately mislead investors by taking actions to
make their companies appear more valuable than they truly are. Sometimes these ac-
tions are illegal, such as those taken by the senior managers at Enron. Sometimes the
actions are legal but are taken to push the current market price above its fundamental
price in the short term. For example, suppose a utility’s stock price is equal to its fun-
damental price of $50 per share. What would happen if the utility substantially re-
duced its tree-trimming program but didn’t tell investors? This would lower current
costs and thus boost current earnings and current cash flow, but it would also lead to
major expenditures in the future when falling limbs damage the lines. If investors
were told about the major repair costs facing the company, the market price would
immediately drop to a new fundamental value of $45. But if investors were kept in
the dark, they might misinterpret the higher-than-expected current earnings, and
the market price might go up to $52. Investors would eventually understand the situ-
ation when the company later incurred large costs to repair the damaged lines; when
that happened, the price would fall to its fundamental value of $45.
Consider this hypothetical sequence of events. A company’s managers deceived inves-
tors, and the price rose to $52 when it would have fallen to $45 if not for the deception.
Of course, this benefited those who owned the stock at the time of the deception, in-
cluding managers with stock options. But when the deception came to light, those

Firm, Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs, and Ownership Structure,” Journal of Financial Economics, Oc-
tober 1976, 305–360. Another article by Jensen specifically addresses these issues; see “Value Maximiza-
tion, Stakeholder Theory, and the Corporate Objective Function,” Journal of Applied Corporate Finance,

stockholders who still owned the stock suffered a significant loss, ending up with stock
worth less than its original fundamental value. If the managers cashed in their stock op-
tions prior to this, then only the stockholders were hurt by the deception. Because the
managers were hired to act in the interests of stockholders, their deception was a breach
of their fiduciary responsibility. In addition, the managers’ deception would damage the
company’s reputation, making it harder to raise capital in the future.
Therefore, when we say management’s objective should be to maximize stockholder
wealth, we really mean it is to maximize the fundamental price of the firm’s common stock,
not just the current market price. Firms do, of course, have other objectives; in partic-
ular, the managers who make the actual decisions are interested in their own personal
satisfaction, in their employees’ welfare, and in the good of their communities and of
society at large. Still, for the reasons set forth in the following sections, maximizing in-
trinsic stock value is the most important objective for most corporations.
Intrinsic Stock Value Maximization and Social Welfare
If a firm attempts to maximize its intrinsic stock value, is this good or bad for society?
In general, it is good. Aside from such illegal actions as fraudulent accounting, ex-
Ethics for Individuals and Businesses
A

ethics
can
be
measured by the tendency of its employees, from the
top down, to adhere to laws, regulations, and moral
standards relating to product safety and quality, fair
employment practices, fair marketing and selling prac-
tices, the use of confidential information for personal
gain, community involvement, and illegal payments to
obtain business.
Ethical Dilemmas
When conflicts arise between profits and ethics, some-
times legal and ethical considerations make the choice
obvious. At other times the right choice isn’t clear. For
example, suppose Norfolk Southern’s managers know
that its trains are polluting the air, but the amount of
pollution is within legal limits and further reduction
would be costly, causing harm to their shareholders.
Are the managers ethically bound to reduce pollution?
Aren’t they also ethically bound to act in their share-
holders’ best interests? This is clearly a dilemma.
Ethical Responsibility
Over the past few years, illegal ethical lapses have led
to a number of bankruptcies, which have raised this
question: Were the companies unethical, or was it just
a few of their employees? Arthur Andersen, an account-
ing firm, audited Enron, WorldCom, and several other
companies that committed accounting fraud. The U.S.
Justice Department concluded that Andersen itself was
guilty because it fostered a climate in which unethical
behavior was permitted, and it built an incentive system
that made such behavior profitable to both the perpe-
trators and the firm itself. As a result, Andersen went
out of business. Anderson was later judged to be not
guilty, but by the time the judgment was rendered the
company was already out of business. People simply
did not want to deal with a tainted accounting firm.
Protecting Ethical Employees
If employees discover questionable activities or are
given questionable orders, should they obey their
bosses’ orders, refuse to obey those orders, or report
the situation to a higher authority, such as the com-
pany’s board of directors, its auditors, or a federal
prosecutor? In 2002 Congress passed the Sarbanes-
Oxley
Act,
with
a
provision
designed
to
protect
“whistle-blowers.” If an employee reports corporate
wrongdoing and later is penalized, he or she can ask
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to
investigate the situation, and if the employee was im-
properly penalized, the company can be required to re-
instate the person, along with back pay and a sizable
penalty award. Several big awards have been handed
out since the act was passed.

Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

ploiting monopoly power, violating safety codes, and failing to meet environmental
standards, the same actions that maximize intrinsic stock values also benefit society. Here
are some of the reasons:
1. To a large extent, the owners of stock are society. Seventy-five years ago this
was not true, because most stock ownership was concentrated in the hands of a
relatively small segment of society consisting of the wealthiest individuals. Since
then, there has been explosive growth in pension funds, life insurance companies,
and mutual funds. These institutions now own more than 61% of all stock, which
means that most individuals have an indirect stake in the stock market. In addi-
tion, more than 47% of all U.S. households now own stock or bonds directly, as
compared with only 32.5% in 1989. Thus, most members of society now have an
important stake in the stock market, either directly or indirectly. Therefore,
when a manager takes actions to maximize the stock price, this improves the
quality of life for millions of ordinary citizens.
2. Consumers benefit. Stock price maximization requires efficient, low-cost busi-
nesses that produce high-quality goods and services at the lowest possible cost.
This means that companies must develop products and services that consumers
want and need, which leads to new technology and new products. Also, compa-
nies that maximize their stock price must generate growth in sales by creating
value for customers in the form of efficient and courteous service, adequate
stocks of merchandise, and well-located business establishments.
People sometimes argue that firms, in their efforts to raise profits and stock
prices, increase product prices and gouge the public. In a reasonably competi-
tive economy, which we have, prices are constrained by competition and con-
sumer resistance. If a firm raises its prices beyond reasonable levels, it will
simply lose its market share. Even giant firms such as Dell and Coca-Cola
lose business to domestic and foreign competitors if they set prices above the
level necessary to cover production costs plus a “normal” profit. Of course,
firms want to earn more, and they constantly try to cut costs, develop new pro-
ducts, and so on, and thereby earn above-normal profits. Note, though, that if
they are indeed successful and do earn above-normal profits, those very profits
will attract competition, which will eventually drive prices down. So again, the
main long-term beneficiary is the consumer.
3. Employees benefit. There are situations where a stock increases when a com-
pany announces plans to lay off employees, but viewed over time this is the ex-
ception rather than the rule. In general, companies that successfully increase
stock prices also grow and add more employees, thus benefiting society. Note
too that many governments across the world, including U.S. federal and state
governments, are privatizing some of their state-owned activities by selling these
operations to investors. Perhaps not surprisingly, the sales and cash flows of re-
cently privatized companies generally improve. Moreover, studies show that
newly privatized companies tend to grow and thus require more employees
when they are managed with the goal of stock price maximization.
One of Fortune magazine’s key criteria in determining its list of most-admired
companies is a company’s ability to attract, develop, and retain talented people.
The results consistently show high correlations among admiration for a company,
its ability to satisfy employees, and its creation of value for shareholders. Employ-
ees find that it is both fun and financially rewarding to work for successful com-
panies. Thus, successful companies get the cream of the employee crop, and
skilled, motivated employees are one of the keys to corporate success.

Managerial Actions to Maximize Shareholder Wealth
What types of actions can managers take to maximize shareholder wealth? To answer
this question, we first need to ask, “What determines a firm’s value?” In a nutshell, it
is a company’s ability to generate cash flows now and in the future.
We address different aspects of this in detail throughout the book, but we can
lay out three basic facts now: (1) any financial asset, including a company’s stock, is
valuable only to the extent that it generates cash flows; (2) the timing of cash flows
matters—cash received sooner is better; and (3) investors are averse to risk, so all else
equal, they will pay more for a stock whose cash flows are relatively certain than for
one whose cash flows are more risky. Because of these three facts, managers can en-
hance their firm’s value by increasing the size of the expected cash flows, by speeding
up their receipt, and by reducing their risk.
The cash flows that matter are called free cash flows (FCF), not because they are
free, but because they are available (or free) for distribution to all of the company’s
investors, including creditors and stockholders. You will learn how to calculate free
cash flows in Chapter 2, but for now you should know that free cash flows depend
on three factors: (1) sales revenues, (2) operating costs and taxes, and (3) required
new investments in operating capital. In particular, free cash flow is equal to:
FCF = Sales revenues −Operating costs −Operating taxes
−Required new investments in operating capital
Brand managers and marketing managers can increase sales (and prices) by
truly understanding their customers and then designing goods and services
that customers want. Human resource managers can improve productivity through
training and employee retention. Production and logistics managers can improve
profit margins, reduce inventory, and improve throughput at factories by imple-
menting supply chain management, just-in-time inventory management, and lean
manufacturing. In fact, all managers make decisions that can increase free cash
flows.
One of the financial manager’s roles is to help others see how their actions affect
the company’s ability to generate cash flow and, hence, its intrinsic value. Financial
managers also must decide how to finance the firm. In particular, they must choose
the mix of debt and equity that should be used and the specific types of debt and eq-
uity securities that should be issued. They must also decide what percentage of cur-
rent earnings should be retained and reinvested rather than paid out as dividends.
Along with these financing decisions, the general level of interest rates in the econ-
omy, the risk of the firm’s operations, and stock market investors’ overall attitude to-
ward risk determine the rate of return that is required to satisfy a firm’s investors.
This rate of return from an investor’s perspective is a cost from the company’s point
of view. Therefore, the rate of return required by investors is called the weighted
average cost of capital (WACC).
The relationship between a firm’s fundamental value, its free cash flows, and its
cost of capital is defined by the following equation:
Value ¼
FCF1
ð1þWACCÞ1 þ
FCF2
ð1þWACCÞ2 þ
FCF3
ð1þWACCÞ3 þ…þ
FCF∞
ð1þWACCÞ∞
(1-1)
We will explain how to use this equation in later chapters, but for now note that
(1) a growing firm often needs to raise external funds in the financial markets and
12

(2) the actual price of a firm’s stock is determined in those markets. Therefore, the
rest of this chapter focuses on financial markets.

1.4 AN OVERVIEW OF THE CAPITAL
ALLOCATION PROCESS
Businesses often need capital to implement growth plans; governments require funds
to finance building projects; and individuals frequently want loans to purchase cars,
homes, and education. Where can they get this money? Fortunately, there are some
individuals and firms with incomes greater than their expenditures. In contrast to
William Shakespeare’s advice, most individuals and firms are both borrowers and
lenders. For example, an individual might borrow money with a car loan or a home
mortgage but might also lend money through a bank savings account. In the aggre-
gate, individuals are net savers and provide most of the funds ultimately used by non-
financial corporations. Although most nonfinancial corporations own some financial
securities, such as short-term Treasury bills, nonfinancial corporations are net bor-
rowers in the aggregate. It should be no surprise to you that in the United States
Corporate Scandals and Maximizing Stock Price
The list of corporate scandals seems to go on forever:
Sunbeam, Enron, ImClone, WorldCom, Tyco, Adelphia ….
At first glance, it’s tempting to say, “Look what happens
when managers care only about maximizing stock price.”
But a closer look reveals a much different story. In fact,
if these managers were trying to maximize stock price,
they failed dismally, given the resulting values of these
companies.
Although details vary from company to company, a
few common themes emerge. First, managerial com-
pensation was linked to the short-term performance of
the stock price via poorly designed stock option and
stock grant programs. This provided managers with a
powerful incentive to drive up the stock price at the
option vesting date without worrying about the future.
Second, it is virtually impossible to take legal and eth-
ical actions that drive up the stock price in the short
term without harming it in the long term because the
value of a company is based on all of its future free
cash flows and not just cash flows in the immediate
future. Because legal and ethical actions to quickly
drive up the stock price didn’t exist (other than the
old-fashioned ones, such as increasing sales, cutting
costs, or reducing capital requirements), these man-
agers began bending a few rules. Third, as they ini-
tially got away with bending rules, it seems that their
egos and hubris grew to such an extent that they felt
they were above all rules, so they began breaking
even more rules.
Stock prices did go up, at least temporarily, but as
Abraham Lincoln said, “You can’t fool all of the people
all of the time.” As the scandals became public, the
stocks’ prices plummeted, and in some cases the com-
panies were ruined.
There are several important lessons to be learned
from these examples. First, people respond to incen-
tives, and poorly designed incentives can cause disas-
trous results. Second, ethical violations usually begin
with small steps, so if stockholders want managers to
avoid large ethical violations, then they shouldn’t let
them make the small ones. Third, there is no shortcut
to creating lasting value. It takes hard work to increase
sales, cut costs, and reduce capital requirements, but
this is the formula for success.
Chapter 1: An Overview of Financial Management and the Financial Environment

federal, state, and local governments are also net borrowers in the aggregate
(although many foreign governments, such as those of China and oil-producing
countries, are actually net lenders). Banks and other financial corporations raise
money with one hand and invest it with the other. For example, a bank might raise
money from individuals in the form of a savings account and then lend most of that
money to business customers. In the aggregate, financial corporations borrow slightly
more than they lend.
Transfers of capital between savers and those who need capital take place in
three different ways. Direct transfers of money and securities, as shown in Panel 1
of Figure 1-1, occur when a business (or government) sells its securities directly to
savers. The business delivers its securities to savers, who in turn provide the firm
with the money it needs. For example, a privately held company might sell shares of
stock directly to a new shareholder, or the U.S. government might sell a Treasury
bond directly to an individual investor.
As shown in Panel 2, indirect transfers may go through an investment banking
house such as Goldman Sachs, which underwrites the issue. An underwriter serves
as a middleman and facilitates the issuance of securities. The company sells its stocks
or bonds to the investment bank, which in turn sells these same securities to savers.
Because new securities are involved and the corporation receives the proceeds of the
sale, this is a “primary” market transaction.
Transfers can also be made through a financial intermediary such as a bank or
mutual fund, as shown in Panel 3. Here the intermediary obtains funds from savers
in exchange for its own securities. The intermediary then uses this money to pur-
chase and then hold businesses’ securities. For example, a saver might give dollars
to a bank and receive a certificate of deposit, and then the bank might lend the
money to a small business, receiving in exchange a signed loan. Thus, intermediaries
literally create new types of securities.

1.5 FINANCIAL SECURITIES
The variety of financial securities is limited only by human creativity, ingenuity, and
governmental regulations. At the risk of oversimplification, we can classify most fi-
nancial securities by the type of claim and the time until maturity. In addition, some
securities actually are created from packages of other securities. We discuss the key
aspects of financial securities in this section.
Type of Claim: Debt, Equity, or Derivatives
Financial securities are simply pieces of paper with contractual provisions that entitle
their owners to specific rights and claims on specific cash flows or values. Debt in-
struments typically have specified payments and a specified maturity. For example,
an Alcoa bond might promise to pay 10% interest for 30 years, at which time it pro-
mises to make a $1,000 principal payment. If debt matures in more than a year, it is
called a capital market security. Thus, the Alcoa bond in this example is a capital mar-
ket security.
If the debt matures in less than a year, it is a money market security. For example,
Home Depot might expect to receive $300,000 in 75 days, but it needs cash now.
Home Depot might issue commercial paper, which is essentially an IOU. In this exam-
ple, Home Depot might agree to pay $300,000 in 75 days in exchange for $297,000
today. Thus, commercial paper is a money market security.
Equity instruments are a claim upon a residual value. For example, Alcoa’s stock-
holders are entitled to the cash flows generated by Alcoa after its bondholders, cred-
itors, and other claimants have been satisfied. Because stock has no maturity date, it is
a capital market security.
Notice that debt and equity represent claims upon the cash flows generated by
real assets, such as the cash flows generated by Alcoa’s factories and operations. In
contrast, derivatives are securities whose values depend on, or are derived from, the
values of some other traded assets. For example, options and futures are two impor-
tant types of derivatives, and their values depend on the prices of other assets. An
option on Alcoa stock or a futures contract to buy pork bellies are examples of deri-
vatives. We discuss options in Chapter 8 and in Web Extension 1A, which provides a
brief overview of options and other derivatives.
Some securities are a mix of debt, equity, and derivatives. For example, preferred
stock has some features like debt and some like equity, while convertible debt has
both debt-like and option-like features.
We discuss these and other financial securities in detail later in the book,
but Table 1-1 provides a summary of the most important conventional financial
securities. We discuss rates of return later in this chapter, but notice now in
Table 1-1 that interest rates tend to increase with the maturity and risk of the
security.

dCommon stocks are expected to provide a “return” in the form of dividends and capital gains rather than interest. Of course, if
you buy a stock, your actual return may be considerably higher or lower than your expected return.

Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

The Process of Securitization
Many types of assets can be securitized, but we will focus on mortgages because they
played such an important role in the global financial crisis. At one time, most mort-
gages were made by savings and loan associations (S&Ls), which took in the vast
majority of their deposits from individuals who lived in nearby neighborhoods. The
S&Ls pooled these deposits and then lent money to people in the neighborhood in
the form of fixed-rate mortgages, which were pieces of paper signed by borrowers
promising to make specified payments to the S&L. The new homeowners paid prin-
cipal and interest to the S&L, which then paid interest to its depositors and rein-
vested the principal repayments in other mortgages. This was clearly better than
having individuals lend directly to aspiring homeowners, because a single individual
might not have enough money to finance an entire house nor the expertise to know if
the borrower was creditworthy. Note that the S&Ls were government-chartered in-
stitutions, and they obtained money in the form of immediately withdrawable depos-
its and then invested most of it in the form of mortgages with fixed interest rates and
on individual homes. Also, initially the S&Ls were not permitted to have branch
operations—they were limited to one office so as to maintain their local orientation.
These restrictions had important implications. First, in the 1950s there was a mas-
sive migration of people to the west, so there was a strong demand for funds in that
area. However, the wealthiest savers were in the east. That meant that mortgage in-
terest rates were much higher in California and other western states than in New
York and the east. This created disequilibrium, something that can’t exist forever in
financial markets.
Second, note that the S&Ls’ assets consisted mainly of long-term, fixed-rate mort-
gages, but their liabilities were in the form of deposits that could be withdrawn im-
mediately. The combination of long-term assets and short-term liabilities created
another problem. If the overall level of interest rates increased, the S&Ls would
have to increase the rates they paid on deposits or else savers would take their money
elsewhere. However, the S&Ls couldn’t increase the rates on their outstanding mort-
gages because these mortgages had fixed interest rates. This problem came to a head
in the 1960s, when the Vietnam War led to inflation, which pushed up interest rates.
At this point, the “money market fund” industry was born, and it literally sucked
money out of the S&Ls, forcing many of them into bankruptcy.
The government responded by giving the S&Ls broader lending powers, permit-
ting nationwide branching, and allowing them to obtain funds as long-term debt in
addition to immediately withdrawable deposits. Unfortunately, these changes had an-
other set of unintended consequences. S&L managers who had previously dealt with
a limited array of investments and funding choices in local communities were sud-
denly allowed to expand their scope of operations. Many of these inexperienced
S&L managers made poor business decisions and the result was disastrous—virtually
the entire S&L industry collapsed, with many S&Ls going bankrupt or being ac-
quired in shotgun mergers with commercial banks.
The demise of the S&Ls created another financial disequilibrium—a higher de-
mand for mortgages than the supply of available funds from the mortgage lending
industry. Savings were accumulating in pension funds, insurance companies, and
other institutions, not in S&Ls and banks, the traditional mortgage lenders.
This situation led to the development of “mortgage securitization,” a process
whereby banks, the remaining S&Ls, and specialized mortgage originating firms would
originate mortgages and then sell them to investment banks, which would bundle them
into packages and then use these packages as collateral for bonds that could be sold to
Chapter 1: An Overview of Financial Management and the Financial Environment
17

pension funds, insurance companies, and other institutional investors. Thus, individual
loans were bundled and then used to back a bond—a “security”—that could be traded
in the financial markets.
Congress facilitated this process by creating two stockholder-owned but government-
sponsored entities, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac were financed by issuing a relatively small amount of stock and a huge amount
of debt.
To illustrate the securitization process, suppose an S&L or bank is paying its de-
positors 5% but is charging its borrowers 8% on their mortgages. The S&L can take
hundreds of these mortgages, put them in a pool, and then sell the pool to Fannie
Mae. The mortgagees can still make their payments to the original S&L, which will
then forward the payments (less a small handling fee) to Fannie Mae.
Consider the S&L’s perspective. First, it can use the cash it receives from selling
the mortgages to make additional loans to other aspiring homeowners. Second,
the S&L is no longer exposed to the risk of owning mortgages. The risk hasn’t
disappeared—it has been transferred from the S&L (and its federal deposit insurers)
to Fannie Mae. This is clearly a better situation for aspiring homeowners and per-
haps also for taxpayers.
Fannie Mae can take the mortgages it just bought, put them into a very large pool,
and sell bonds backed by the pool to investors. The homeowner will pay the S&L,
the S&L will forward the payment to Fannie Mae, and Fannie Mae will use the funds
to pay interest on the bonds it issued, to pay dividends on its stock, and to buy addi-
tional mortgages from S&Ls, which can then make additional loans to aspiring
homeowners. Notice that the mortgage risk has been shifted from Fannie Mae to
the investors who now own the mortgage-backed bonds.
How does the situation look from the perspective of the investors who own the
bonds? In theory, they own a share in a large pool of mortgages from all over the
country, so a problem in a particular region’s real estate market or job market won’t
affect the whole pool. Therefore, their expected rate of return should be very close to
the 8% rate paid by the home-owning mortgagees. (It will be a little less due to han-
dling fees charged by the S&L and Fannie Mae and to the small amount of expected
losses from the homeowners who could be expected to default on their mortgages.)
These investors could have deposited their money at an S&L and earned a virtually
risk-free 5%. Instead, they chose to accept more risk in hopes of the higher 8% re-
turn. Note too that mortgage-backed bonds are more liquid than individual mortgage
loans, so the securitization process increases liquidity, which is desirable. The bottom
line is that risk has been reduced by the pooling process and then allocated to those
who are willing to accept it in return for a higher rate of return.
Thus, in theory it is a win–win–win situation: More money is available for aspiring
homeowners, S&Ls (and taxpayers) have less risk, and there are opportunities for in-
vestors who are willing to take on more risk to obtain higher potential returns. Al-
though the securitization process began with mortgages, it is now being used with
car loans, student loans, credit card debt, and other loans. The details vary for differ-
ent assets, but the processes and benefits are similar to those with mortgage securiti-
zation: (1) increased supplies of lendable funds; (2) transfer of risk to those who are
willing to bear it; and (3) increased liquidity for holders of the debt.
Mortgage securitization was a win–win situation in theory, but as practiced in the
last decade it has turned into a lose–lose situation. We will have more to say about
securitization and the global economic crisis later in this chapter, but first let’s take a
look at the cost of money.
18
Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

1.6 THE COST OF MONEY
In a free economy, capital from those with available funds is allocated through the
price system to users who have a need for funds. The interaction of the providers’
supply and the users’ demand determines the cost (or price) of money, which is the
rate users pay to providers. For debt, we call this price the interest rate. For equity,
we call it the cost of equity, and it consists of the dividends and capital gains stock-
holders expect. Keep in mind that the “price” of money is a cost from a user’s per-
spective but a return from the provider’s point of view.
Notice in Table 1-1 that a financial instrument’s rate of return generally increases
as its maturity and risk increase. We will have much more to say about the relation-
ships among an individual security’s features, risk, and return later in the book, but
there are some fundamental factors and economic conditions that affect all financial
instruments.
Fundamental Factors That Affect the Cost of Money
The four most fundamental factors affecting the cost of money are (1) production
opportunities, (2) time preferences for consumption, (3) risk, and (4) inflation.
By production opportunities, we mean the ability to turn capital into benefits. If a
business raises capital, the benefits are determined by the expected rates of return
on its production opportunities. If a student borrows to finance his or her education,
the benefits are higher expected future salaries (and, of course, the sheer joy of learn-
ing!). If a homeowner borrows, the benefits are the pleasure from living in his or her
own home, plus any expected appreciation in the value of the home. Observe that the
expected rates of return on these “production opportunities” put an upper limit on
how much users can pay to providers.
Providers can use their current funds for consumption or saving. By saving, they
give up consumption now in the expectation of having more consumption in the fu-
ture. If providers have a strong preference for consumption now, then it takes high
interest rates to induce them to trade current consumption for future consumption.
Therefore, the time preference for consumption has a major impact on the cost of
money. Notice that the time preference for consumption varies for different indivi-
duals, for different age groups, and for different cultures. For example, people in Ja-
pan have a lower time preference for consumption than those in the United States,
which partially explains why Japanese families tend to save more than U.S. families
even though interest rates are lower in Japan.
If the expected rate of return on an investment is risky, then providers require a
higher expected return to induce them to take the extra risk, which drives up the cost
of money. As you will see later in this book, the risk of a security is determined by
market conditions and the security’s particular features.
Inflation also leads to a higher cost of money. For example, suppose you earned
10% one year on your investment but inflation caused prices to increase by 20%.
This means you can’t consume as much at the end of the year as when you originally
invested your money. Obviously, if you had expected 20% inflation, you would have
required a higher rate of return than 10%.
Economic Conditions and Policies That Affect
the Cost of Money
Economic conditions and policies also affect the cost of money. These include:
(1) Federal Reserve policy; (2) the federal budget deficit or surplus; (3) the level of
Chapter 1: An Overview of Financial Management and the Financial Environment
19

business activity; and (4) international factors, including the foreign trade balance, the
international business climate, and exchange rates.
Federal Reserve Policy.
If the Federal Reserve Board wants to stimulate the econ-
omy, it most often uses open market operations to purchases Treasury securities held
by banks. Because banks are selling some of their securities, the banks will have more
cash, which increases their supply of loanable funds, which in turn makes banks will-
ing to lend more money at lower interest rates. In addition, the Fed’s purchases rep-
resent an increase in the demand for Treasury securities. As for anything that is for
sale, increased demand causes Treasury securities’ prices to go up and interest rates
to go down (we explain the mathematical relationship between higher prices and
lower interest rates in Chapter 4; for now, just trust us when we say that a security’s
price and its interest rate move in opposite directions). The net result is a reduction
in interest rates, which stimulates the economy by making it less costly for companies
to borrow for new projects or for individuals to borrow for major purchases or other
expenditures.
When banks sell their holdings of Treasury securities to the Fed, the banks’ re-
serves go up, which increases the money supply. A larger money supply ultimately
leads to an increase in expected inflation, which eventually pushes interest rates up.
Thus, the Fed can stimulate the economy in the short term by driving down interest
rates and increasing the money supply, but this creates longer-term inflationary pres-
sures. This is exactly the dilemma facing the Fed in early 2009 as it attempts to stim-
ulate the economy to prevent another great depression.
If the Fed wishes to slow down the economy and reduce inflation, the Fed re-
verses the process. Instead of purchasing Treasury securities, the Fed sells Treasury
securities to banks, which causes an increase in short-term interest rates but a de-
crease in long-term inflationary pressures.
Budget Deficits or Surpluses.
If the federal government spends more than it
takes in from tax revenues then it’s running a deficit, and that deficit must be covered
either by borrowing or by printing money (increasing the money supply). The gov-
ernment borrows by issuing new Treasury securities. All else held equal, this creates
a greater supply of Treasury securities, which leads to lower security prices and
higher interest rates. Other federal government actions that increase the money sup-
ply also increase expectations for future inflation, which drives up interest rates.
Thus, the larger the federal deficit, other things held constant, the higher the level
of interest rates. As shown in Figure 1-2, the federal government has run large bud-
get deficits for 12 of the past 16 years, and even larger deficits are predicted for at
least several years into the future. These deficits contributed to the cumulative fed-
eral debt, which stood at over $11 trillion at the beginning of 2009.
Business Activity.
Figure 1-3 shows interest rates, inflation, and recessions. No-
tice that interest rates and inflation typically rise prior to a recession and fall after-
ward. There are several reasons for this pattern.
Consumer demand slows during a recession, keeping companies from increasing
prices, which reduces price inflation. Companies also cut back on hiring, which re-
duces wage inflation. Less disposable income causes consumers to reduce their pur-
chases of homes and automobiles, reducing consumer demand for loans. Companies
reduce investments in new operations, which reduces their demand for funds. The
cumulative effect is downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. The Federal
Reserve is also active during recessions, trying to stimulate the economy by driving
down interest rates.

International Trade Deficits or Surpluses.
Businesses and individuals in the
United States buy from and sell to people and firms in other countries. If we buy
more than we sell (that is, if we import more than we export), we are said to be run-
ning a foreign trade deficit. When trade deficits occur, they must be financed, and the
main source of financing is debt. In other words, if we import $200 billion of goods
but export only $90 billion, we run a trade deficit of $110 billion, and we will proba-
bly borrow the $110 billion.4 Therefore, the larger our trade deficit, the more we
must borrow, and increased borrowing drives up interest rates. Also, international in-
vestors are willing to hold U.S. debt if and only if the risk-adjusted rate paid on this
debt is competitive with interest rates in other countries. Therefore, if the Federal
Reserve attempts to lower interest rates in the United States, causing our rates to
fall below rates abroad (after adjustments for expected changes in the exchange
rate), then international investors will sell U.S. bonds, which will depress bond prices
and result in higher U.S. rates. Thus, if the trade deficit is large relative to the size of

years, but the primary method has been by borrowing from foreigners.

the overall economy, it will hinder the Fed’s ability to reduce interest rates and com-
bat a recession.
The United States has been running annual trade deficits since the mid-1970s; see
Figure 1-2 for recent years. The cumulative effect of trade deficits and budget defi-
cits is that the United States has become the largest debtor nation of all time. As
noted earlier, this federal debt has exceeded $11 trillion! As a result, our interest rates
are very much influenced by interest rates in other countries around the world.
International Country Risk.
International risk factors may increase the cost of
money that is invested abroad. Country risk is the risk that arises from investing or
doing business in a particular country, and it depends on the country’s economic, po-
litical, and social environment. Countries with stable economic, social, political, and
regulatory systems provide a safer climate for investment and therefore have less
country risk than less stable nations. Examples of country risk include the risk associ-
ated with changes in tax rates, regulations, currency conversion, and exchange rates.
Country risk also includes the risk that (1) property will be expropriated without ad-
equate compensation; (2) the host country will impose new stipulations concerning
local production, sourcing, or hiring practices; and (3) there might be damage or de-
struction of facilities due to internal strife.

Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

Exchange Rate Risk.
International securities frequently are denominated in a
currency other than the dollar, which means that the value of an investment depends
on what happens to exchange rates. This is known as exchange rate risk. For exam-
ple, if a U.S. investor purchases a Japanese bond, interest will probably be paid in
Japanese yen, which must then be converted to dollars if the investor wants to spend
his or her money in the United States. If the yen weakens relative to the dollar, then
the yen will buy fewer dollars when it comes time for the investor to convert the Jap-
anese bond’s payout. Alternatively, if the yen strengthens relative to the dollar, the
investor will earn higher dollar returns. It therefore follows that the effective rate of
return on a foreign investment will depend on both the performance of the foreign
security in its home market and on what happens to exchange rates over the life of
the investment. We discuss exchange rates in detail in Chapter 17.
Self-Test
What four fundamental factors affect the cost of money?
Name some economic conditions that influence interest rates and
explain their effects.
1.7 FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
When raising capital, direct transfers of funds from individuals to businesses are most
common for small businesses or in economies where financial markets and institu-
tions are not well developed. Businesses in developed economies usually find it
more efficient to enlist the services of one or more financial institutions to raise capi-
tal. Most financial institutions don’t compete in a single line of business but instead
provide a wide variety of services and products, both domestically and globally. The
following sections describe the major types of financial institutions and services, but
keep in mind that the dividing lines among them are often blurred. Also, note that
the global financial crisis we are now going through is changing the structure of our
financial institutions, and new regulations are certain to affect those that remain. Fi-
nance today is dynamic, to say the least!
Investment Banks and Brokerage Activities
Investment banking houses help companies raise capital. Such organizations under-
write security offerings, which means they (1) advise corporations regarding the de-
sign and pricing of new securities, (2) buy these securities from the issuing
corporation, and (3) resell them to investors. Although the securities are sold twice,
this process is really one primary market transaction, with the investment banker act-
ing as a facilitator to help transfer capital from savers to businesses. An investment
bank often is a division or subsidiary of a larger company. For example, JPMorgan
Chase & Co. is a very large financial services firm, with over $2 trillion in managed
assets. One of its holdings is J.P. Morgan, an investment banking house.
In addition to security offerings, investment banks also provide consulting and ad-
visory services, such as merger and acquisition (M&A) analysis and investment man-
agement for wealthy individuals.
Most investment banks also provide brokerage services for institutions and indivi-
duals (called “retail” customers). For example, Merrill Lynch (acquired in 2008 by
Bank of America) has a large retail brokerage operation that provides advice and exe-
cutes trades for its individual clients. Similarly, J.P. Morgan helps execute trades for
institutional customers, such as pension funds.
At one time, most investment banks were partnerships, with income generated pri-
marily by fees from their underwriting, M&A consulting, asset management, and
Chapter 1: An Overview of Financial Management and the Financial Environment
23

brokering activities. When business was good, investment banks generated high fees
and paid big bonuses to their partners. When times were tough, investment banks
paid no bonuses and often fired employees. In the 1990s, however, most investment
banks were reorganized into publicly traded corporations (or were acquired and then
operated as subsidiaries of public companies). For example, in 1994 Lehman Brothers
sold some of its own shares of stock to the public via an IPO. Like most corpora-
tions, Lehman Brothers was financed by a combination of equity and debt. A relaxa-
tion of regulations in the 2000s allowed investment banks to undertake much riskier
activities than at any time since the Great Depression. Basically, the new regulations
allowed investment banks to use an unprecedented amount of debt to finance their
activities—Lehman used roughly $30 of debt for every dollar of equity. In addition
to their fee-generating activities, most investment banks also began trading securities
for their own accounts. In other words, they took the borrowed money and invested
it in financial securities. If you are earning 12% on your investments while paying
8% on your borrowings, then the more money you borrow, the more profit you
make. But if you are leveraged 30 to 1 and your investments decline in value by even
3.33%, your business will fail. This is exactly what happened to Bear Stearns, Leh-
man Brothers, and Merrill Lynch in the fall of 2008. In short, they borrowed money,
used it to make risky investments, and then failed when the investments turned out to
be worth less than the amount they owed. Notice that it was not their traditional in-
vestment banking activities that caused the failure, but the fact that they borrowed so
much and used those funds to speculate in the market.
Deposit-Taking Financial Intermediaries
Some financial institutions take deposits from savers and then lend most of the de-
posited money to borrowers. Following is a brief description of such intermediaries.
Savings and Loan Associations (S&Ls).
As we explained in Section 1.5, S&Ls
originally accepted deposits from many small savers and then loaned this money to
home buyers and consumers. Later, they were allowed to make riskier investments,
such as real estate development. Mutual savings banks (MSBs) are similar to
S&Ls, but they operate primarily in the northeastern states. Today, most S&Ls and
MSBs have been acquired by banks.
Credit Unions.
Credit unions are cooperative associations whose members have a
common bond, such as being employees of the same firm or living in the same geo-
graphic area. Members’ savings are loaned only to other members, generally for auto
purchases, home improvement loans, and home mortgages. Credit unions are often
the cheapest source of funds available to individual borrowers.
Commercial Banks.
Commercial banks raise funds from depositors and by issu-
ing stock and bonds to investors. For example, someone might deposit money in a
checking account. In return, that person can write checks, use a debit card, and
even receive interest on the deposits. Those who buy the banks’ stocks expect to re-
ceive dividends and interest payments. Unlike nonfinancial corporations, most com-
mercial banks are highly leveraged in the sense that they owe much more to their
depositors and creditors than they raised from stockholders. For example, a typical
bank has about $90 of debt for every $10 of stockholders’ equity. If the bank’s assets
are worth $100, we can calculate its equity capital by subtracting the $90 of liabilities
from the $100 of assets: Equity capital = $100 −$90 = $10. But if the assets drop in
value by 5% to $95, the equity drops to $5 = $95 −$90, a 50% decline.
24
Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

Banks are critically important to a well-functioning economy, and their high lever-
age makes them risky. As a result, banks are more highly regulated than nonfinancial
firms. Given the high risk, banks might have a hard time attracting and retaining de-
posits unless the deposits were insured, so the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora-
tion (FDIC), which is backed by the U.S. government, insures up to $250,000 per
depositor. As a result of the global economic crisis, this insured amount was increased
from $100,000 in 2008 to reassure depositors.
Without such insurance, if depositors believed that a bank was in trouble, they
would rush to withdraw funds. This is called a “bank run,” which is exactly what hap-
pened in the United States during the Great Depression, causing many bank failures
and leading to the creation of the FDIC in an effort to prevent future bank runs. Not
all countries have their own versions of the FDIC, so international bank runs are still
possible. In fact, a bank run occurred in September 2008 at the U.K. bank Northern
Rock, leading to its nationalization by the government.
Most banks are small and locally owned, but the largest banks are parts of giant
financial services firms. For example, JPMorgan Chase Bank, commonly called Chase
Bank, is owned by JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Citibank is owned by Citicorp
(at the time we write this, but perhaps not when you read this—the financial land-
scape is changing daily).
Investment Funds
At some financial institutions, savers have an ownership interest in a pool of funds
rather than owning a deposit account. Examples include mutual funds, hedge funds,
and private equity funds.
Mutual Funds.
Mutual funds are corporations that accept money from savers
and then use these funds to buy financial instruments. These organizations pool
funds, which allows them to reduce risks by diversification and achieve economies
of scale in analyzing securities, managing portfolios, and buying/selling securities.
Different funds are designed to meet the objectives of different types of savers.
Hence, there are bond funds for those who desire safety and stock funds for savers
who are willing to accept risks in the hope of higher returns. There are literally thou-
sands of different mutual funds with dozens of different goals and purposes. Some
funds are actively managed, with their managers trying to find undervalued securities,
while other funds are passively managed and simply try to minimize expenses by
matching the returns on a particular market index.
Money market funds invest in short-term, low-risk securities, such as Treasury
bills and commercial paper. Many of these funds offer interest-bearing checking ac-
counts with rates that are greater than those offered by banks, so many people invest
in mutual funds as an alternative to depositing money in a bank. Note, though, that
money market funds are not required to be insured by the FDIC and so are riskier
than bank deposits.
Most traditional mutual funds allow investors to redeem their share of the fund
only at the close of business. A special type of mutual fund, the exchange traded
fund (ETF), allows investors to sell their share at any time during normal trading
hours. ETFs usually have very low management expenses and are rapidly gaining in
popularity.
Hedge Funds.
Hedge funds raise money from investors and engage in a variety
of investment activities. Unlike typical mutual funds, which can have thousands of
investors, hedge funds are limited to institutional investors and a relatively small
Chapter 1: An Overview of Financial Management and the Financial Environment
25

number of high–net-worth individuals. Because these investors are supposed to be
sophisticated, hedge funds are much less regulated than mutual funds. The first
hedge funds literally tried to hedge their bets by forming portfolios of conventional
securities and derivatives in such a way as to limit their potential losses without
sacrificing too much of their potential gains. Recently, though, most hedge funds
began to lever their positions by borrowing heavily. Many hedge funds had spec-
tacular rates of return during the 1990s. This success attracted more investors, and
thousands of new hedge funds were created. Much of the low-hanging fruit had
already been picked, however, so the hedge funds began pursuing much riskier
(and unhedged) strategies. Perhaps not surprisingly (at least in retrospect), some
funds have produced spectacular losses. For example, many hedge fund investors
suffered huge losses in 2007 and 2008 when large numbers of sub-prime mortgages
defaulted.
Private Equity Funds.
Private equity funds are similar to hedge funds in that
they are limited to a relatively small number of large investors, but they differ in
that they own stock (equity) in other companies and often control those companies,
whereas hedge funds usually own many different types of securities. In contrast to a
mutual fund, which might own a small percentage of a publicly traded company’s
stock, a private equity fund typically owns virtually all of a company’s stock. Because
the company’s stock is not traded in the public markets, it is called “private equity.”
In fact, private equity funds often take a public company (or subsidiary) and turn it
private, such as the 2007 privatization of Chrysler by Cerberus. The general partners
who manage the private equity funds usually sit on the boards of the companies the
funds owns and guide the firms’ strategies with the goal of later selling them for a
profit. For example, The Carlyle Group, Clayton Dubilier & Rice, and Merrill
Lynch Global Private Equity bought Hertz from Ford on December 22, 2005, and
then sold shares of Hertz in an IPO less than a year later.
Chapter 15 provides additional discussion of private equity funds, but it is impor-
tant to note here that many private equity funds experienced high rates of return in
the last decade, and those returns attracted enormous sums from investors. A few
funds, most notably The Blackstone Group, actually went public themselves through
an IPO. Just as with hedge funds, the performance of many private equity funds fal-
tered. For example, shortly after its IPO in June 2007, Blackstone’s stock price was
over $31 per share; by early 2009, it had fallen to about $4.
Life Insurance Companies and Pension Funds
Life insurance companies take premiums, invest these funds in stocks, bonds, real
estate, and mortgages, and then make payments to beneficiaries. Life insurance com-
panies also offer a variety of tax-deferred savings plans designed to provide retire-
ment benefits.
Traditional pension funds are retirement plans funded by corporations or
government agencies. Pension funds invest primarily in bonds, stocks, mortgages,
hedge funds, private equity, and real estate. Most companies now offer self-
directed retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans, as an addition to or substitute for
traditional pension plans. In traditional plans, the plan administrators determine
how to invest the funds; in self-directed plans, all individual participants must de-
cide how to invest their own funds. Many companies are switching from traditional
plans to self-directed plans, partly because this shifts the risk from the company to
the employee.

Regulation of Financial Institutions
With the notable exception of investment banks, hedge funds, and private equity
funds, financial institutions have been heavily regulated to ensure their safety and
thus protect investors and depositors. Historically, many of these regulations—which
have included a prohibition on nationwide branch banking, restrictions on the types
of assets the institutions could buy, ceilings on the interest rates they could pay, and
limitations on the types of services they could provide—tended to impede the free
flow of capital and thus hurt the efficiency of our capital markets. Recognizing this
fact, policymakers took several steps from the 1970s to the 1990s to deregulate finan-
cial services companies. For example, the barriers that restricted banks from expand-
ing nationwide were eliminated. Likewise, regulations that once forced a strict
separation of commercial and investment banking were relaxed.
The result of the ongoing regulatory changes has been a blurring of the distinc-
tions between the different types of institutions. Indeed, the trend in the United
States was toward huge financial services corporations, which own banks, S&Ls, in-
vestment banking houses, insurance companies, pension plan operations, and mutual
funds and which have branches across the country and around the world.
For example, Citigroup combined one of the world’s largest commercial banks
(Citibank), a huge insurance company (Travelers), and a major investment bank (Smith
Barney), along with numerous other subsidiaries that operate throughout the world.
This structure was similar to that of major institutions in Europe, Japan, and elsewhere
around the globe. Among the world’s largest world banking companies, only one
(Citigroup) is based in the United States. While U.S. banks have grown dramatically as
a result of recent mergers, they are still relatively small by global standards.
However, the global economic crisis is causing regulators and financial institutions
to rethink the wisdom of conglomerate financial services corporations. For example, in
late 2008 Merrill Lynch sold itself to Bank of America to avoid bankruptcy. That was
supposed to strengthen BofA, but Merrill brought with it billions of “toxic” loans, and
now BofA is in danger of bankruptcy. Then, in early 2009 Citigroup was reorganizing
itself in preparation for spinning off several lines of business into separate companies,
again with the bankruptcy gun pointed straight at its head. Thus, the two largest U.S.
banks are in danger of failure, and their continued survival is due primarily to support
from the U.S. government. Congress and the new Obama administration are currently
(mid-2009) considering new regulations on a variety of financial institutions, and more
bank failures are a certainty. As the crisis unfolds, it will be interesting to see how reg-
ulations and the structure of financial institutions evolve to reshape our financial infra-
structure, both in the U.S. and around the globe.

1.8 FINANCIAL MARKETS
Financial markets bring together people and organizations needing money with
those having surplus funds. There are many different financial markets in a devel-
oped economy. Each market deals with a somewhat different type of instrument, cus-
tomer, or geographic location. Here are some ways to classify markets:
Chapter 1: An Overview of Financial Management and the Financial Environment
27

1. Physical asset markets (also called “tangible” or “real” asset markets) are those
for such products as wheat, autos, real estate, computers, and machinery. Finan-
cial asset markets, on the other hand, deal with stocks, bonds, notes, mortgages,
derivatives, and other financial instruments.
2. Spot markets and futures markets are markets where assets are being bought or
sold for “on-the-spot” delivery (literally, within a few days) or for delivery at
some future date, such as 6 months or a year into the future.
3. Money markets are the markets for short-term, highly liquid debt securities,
while capital markets are the markets for corporate stocks and debt maturing
more than a year in the future. The New York Stock Exchange is an example of
a capital market. When describing debt markets, “short term” generally means
less than 1 year, “intermediate term” means 1 to 5 years, and “long term” means
more than 5 years.
4. Mortgage markets deal with loans on residential, agricultural, commercial, and
industrial real estate, while consumer credit markets involve loans for autos, ap-
pliances, education, vacations, and so on.
5. World, national, regional, and local markets also exist. Thus, depending on an
organization’s size and scope of operations, it may be able to borrow or lend all
around the world, or it may be confined to a strictly local, even neighborhood,
market.
6. Primary markets are the markets in which corporations raise new capital. If
Microsoft were to sell a new issue of common stock to raise capital, this would be
a primary market transaction. The corporation selling the newly created stock re-
ceives the proceeds from such a transaction. The initial public offering (IPO)
market is a subset of the primary market. Here firms “go public” by offering
shares to the public for the first time. Microsoft had its IPO in 1986. Previously,
Bill Gates and other insiders owned all the shares. In many IPOs, the insiders sell
some of their shares and the company sells newly created shares to raise addi-
tional capital. Secondary markets are markets in which existing, already out-
standing securities are traded among investors. Thus, if you decided to buy
1,000 shares of AT&T stock, the purchase would occur in the secondary market.
The New York Stock Exchange is a secondary market, since it deals in outstand-
ing (as opposed to newly issued) stocks. Secondary markets also exist for bonds,
mortgages, and other financial assets. The corporation whose securities are being
traded is not involved in a secondary market transaction and, thus, does not re-
ceive any funds from such a sale.
7. Private markets, where transactions are worked out directly between two parties,
are differentiated from public markets, where standardized contracts are traded
on organized exchanges. Bank loans and private placements of debt with insur-
ance companies are examples of private market transactions. Since these transac-
tions are private, they may be structured in any manner that appeals to the two
parties. By contrast, securities that are issued in public markets (for example,
common stock and corporate bonds) are ultimately held by a large number
of individuals. Public securities must have fairly standardized contractual fea-
tures because public investors cannot afford the time to study unique, nonstan-
dardized contracts. Hence private market securities are more tailor-made but
less liquid, whereas public market securities are more liquid but subject to
greater standardization.
The distinctions among markets are often blurred. For example, it makes little dif-
ference if a firm borrows for 11, 12, or 13 months and thus whether such borrowing
28
Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

is a “money” or “capital” market transaction. You should recognize the big differ-
ences among types of markets, but don’t get hung up trying to distinguish them at
the boundaries.

and futures markets, (3) money and capital markets, (4) primary and secondary mar-
kets, and (5) private and public markets.
1.9 TRADING PROCEDURES IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
A huge volume of trading occurs in the secondary markets. Although there are many
secondary markets for a wide variety of securities, we can classify their trading proce-
dures along two dimensions: location and method of matching orders.
Physical Location versus Electronic Network
A secondary market can be either a physical location exchange or a computer/
telephone network. For example, the New York Stock Exchange, the American
Stock Exchange (AMEX), the Chicago Board of Trade (the CBOT trades futures
and options), and the Tokyo Stock Exchange are all physical location exchanges. In
other words, the traders actually meet and trade in a specific part of a specific
building.
In contrast, Nasdaq, which trades a number of U.S. stocks, is a network of linked
computers. Other network examples are the markets for U.S. Treasury bonds and
foreign exchange, which are conducted via telephone and/or computer networks. In
these electronic markets, the traders never see one another except maybe for cocktails
after work.
By their very nature, networks are less transparent than physical location exchanges.
For example, credit default swaps are traded directly between buyers and sellers, and
there is no easy mechanism for recording, aggregating, and reporting the transactions
or the net positions of the buyers and sellers.
Matching Orders: Auctions, Dealers, and ECNs
The second dimension is the way orders from sellers and buyers are matched. This
can occur through an open outcry auction system, through dealers, or by automated
order matching. An example of an outcry auction is the CBOT, where traders actu-
ally meet in a pit and sellers and buyers communicate with one another through
shouts and hand signals.
In a dealer market, there are “market makers” who keep an inventory of the
stock (or other financial instrument) in much the same way that any merchant keeps
an inventory. These dealers list bid and ask quotes, which are the prices at which
they are willing to buy or sell. Computerized quotation systems keep track of all bid
and asked prices, but they don’t actually match buyers and sellers. Instead, traders
must contact a specific dealer to complete the transaction. Nasdaq (U.S. stocks) is
one such market, as are the London SEAQ (U.K. stocks) and the Neuer Market
(stocks of small German companies).
The third method of matching orders is through an electronic communications
network (ECN). Participants in an ECN post their orders to buy and sell, and the
ECN automatically matches orders. For example, someone might place an order to
buy 1,000 shares of IBM stock—this is called a “market order” since it is to buy the
stock at the current market price. Suppose another participant had placed an order to
sell 1,000 shares of IBM, but only at a price of $91 per share, and this was the lowest
Chapter 1: An Overview of Financial Management and the Financial Environment
29

price of any “sell” order. The ECN would automatically match these two orders, ex-
ecute the trade, and notify both participants that the trade has occurred. The $91 sell
price was a “limit order” as opposed to a market order because the action was limited
by the seller. Note that orders can also be limited with regard to their duration. For
example, someone might stipulate that they are willing to buy 1,000 shares of IBM at
$90 per share if the price falls that low during the next two hours. In other words,
there are limits on the price and/or the duration of the order. The ECN will execute
the limit order only if both conditions are met. Two of the largest ECNs for trading
U.S. stocks are Instinet (now owned by Nasdaq) and Archipelago (now owned by the
NYSE). Other large ECNs include Eurex, a Swiss–German ECN that trades futures
contracts, and SETS, a U.K. ECN that trades stocks.

1.10 TYPES OF STOCK MARKET TRANSACTIONS
Because the primary objectives of financial management are to maximize the firm’s
intrinsic value and then help ensure that the current stock price equals that value,
knowledge of the stock market is important to anyone involved in managing a
business. We can classify stock market transactions into three distinct types: (1)
initial public offerings, (2) seasoned equity offerings, and (3) secondary market
transactions.
Whenever stock is offered to the public for the first time, the company is said to
be going public. This primary market transaction is called the initial public offering
(IPO) market. If a company later decides to sell (i.e., issue) additional shares to raise
new equity capital, this is still a primary market, but it is called a seasoned equity
offering. Trading in the outstanding shares of established, publicly owned companies
are secondary market transactions. For example, if the owner of 100 shares of pub-
licly held stock sells his or her stock, the trade is said to have occurred in the second-
ary market. Thus, the market for outstanding shares, or used shares, is the secondary
market. The company receives no new money when sales occur in this market.
Here is a brief description of recent IPO activity. The 662 total global IPOs in
2008 was a huge decline from the 1,711 in 2007. Proceeds also plummeted, to $77
billion from $279 billion. The Americas raised more money than any other region
in the world, with the United States having 33 IPOs that raised a total of $26.4 bil-
lion. Visa’s IPO was the largest in the world, bringing in over $19 billion.
In the United States, the average first-day return was around 5.3% in 2008. How-
ever, some firms had spectacular first-day price run-ups, such as Intrepid Potash’s
57% gain on its first day of trading and Grand Canyon Education’s 59.7% gain for
the year. However, not all companies fared so well—indeed, Intrepid Potash fell 30%
for the year, despite its great first-day return. Some lost even more, including
GT Solar International, which lost 11.6% on its first day and a total of 82.5% for
the year.
Even if you are able to identify a “hot” issue, it is often difficult to purchase shares
in the initial offering. In strong markets, these deals are generally oversubscribed,
which means that the demand for shares at the offering price exceeds the number of
shares issued. In such instances, investment bankers favor large institutional investors
(who are their best customers), and small investors find it hard, if not impossible, to
get in on the ground floor. They can buy the stock in the aftermarket, but evidence

suggests that if you do not get in on the ground floor, the average IPO underper-
forms the overall market over the long run.5
Before you conclude that it isn’t fair to let only the best customers have the stock
in an initial offering, think about what it takes to become a best customer. Best cus-
tomers are usually investors who have done lots of business in the past with the in-
vestment banking firm’s brokerage department. In other words, they have paid large
sums as commissions in the past, and they are expected to continue doing so in the
future. As is so often true, there is no free lunch—most of the investors who get in
on the ground floor of an IPO have, in fact, paid for this privilege.

1.11 THE SECONDARY STOCK MARKETS
The two leading U.S. stock markets today are the New York Stock Exchange and the
Nasdaq stock market.
The New York Stock Exchange
Before March of 2006, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was a privately held
firm owned by its members. It then merged with Archipelago, a publicly traded com-
pany that was one of the world’s largest ECNs. NYSE members received approxi-
mately 70% of the shares in the combined firm, with Archipelago shareholders
receiving 30%. The combined firm, which also owned the Pacific Exchange, was
known as The NYSE Group, Inc., and was traded publicly under the ticker symbol
NYX. It continued to operate the New York Stock Exchange (a physical location
exchange located on Wall Street) and Arca (comprising the Pacific Exchange and
the ECN formerly known as Archipelago). In 2007 The NYSE Group merged with
Euronext, a European company that operates stock exchanges (called bourses) in
Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, and Lisbon. The combined company is called NYSE
Euronext.
Rational Exuberance?
The Daily Planet Ltd. made history on May 1, 2003, by
becoming the world’s first publicly traded brothel.
Technically, the Daily Planet owns only property, in-
cluding a hotel with 18 rooms, each with a different
theme, but all have multi-person showers and very
large beds. The Daily Planet charges guests a room
fee of 115 Australian dollars (A$) per hour; clients also
pay a fee of A$115 directly to individual members of the
staff.
The IPO was for 7.5 million shares of stock, initially
priced at A$0.50. However, the price ended the first day
of trading at A$1.09 for a first-day return of 118%. The
price closed the second day at A$1.56 for a two-day re-
turn of 212%, one of the largest returns since the days
of the dot-com boom. Institutional investors normally
buy about 60% to 70% of the stock in an IPO, but they
didn’t participate in this offering.
The company is named after the fictitious newspa-
per for which comic strip character Clark Kent was a re-
porter. All receptionists have “Lois Lane” nametags,
and there is a telephone booth in the lobby. What
would Superman think!

The NYSE still has over 300 member organizations, which are corporations, part-
nerships, or LLCs. Membership prices were as high as $4 million in 2005, and the
last sale before the Euronext merger was $3.5 million. Member organizations are
registered broker-dealers, but they may not conduct trading on the floor of the ex-
change unless they also hold a trading license issued by the NYSE. Before going
public, the equivalent to the trading license was called a “seat,” although there was
very little sitting on the floor of the exchange. Trading licenses are now leased by
member organizations from the exchange, with an annual fee of $40,000 for 2009.
The NYSE has leased most of its 1,500 available trading licenses.
Most of the larger investment banking houses operate brokerage departments and
are members of the NYSE with leased trading rights. The NYSE is open on all
normal working days, and members meet in large rooms equipped with electronic
equipment that enables each member to communicate with his or her firm’s offices
throughout the country. For example, Merrill Lynch (now owned by Bank of
America) might receive an order in its Atlanta office from a customer who wants
to buy shares of Procter & Gamble stock. Simultaneously, Edward Jones’ St. Louis
office might receive an order from a customer wishing to sell shares of P&G.
Each broker communicates electronically with the firm’s representative on the
NYSE. Other brokers throughout the country also communicate with their own
exchange members. The exchange members with sell orders offer the shares for
sale, and they are bid for by the members with buy orders. Thus, the NYSE oper-
ates as an auction market.6
The Nasdaq Stock Market
The National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) is a self-regulatory body
that licenses brokers and oversees trading practices. The computerized network used
by the NASD is known as the NASD Automated Quotation System, or Nasdaq.
Nasdaq started as just a quotation system, but it has grown to become an organized
securities market with its own listing requirements. Nasdaq lists about 5,000 stocks,
although not all trade through the same Nasdaq system. For example, the Nasdaq
National Market lists the larger Nasdaq stocks, such as Microsoft and Intel, while
the Nasdaq SmallCap Market lists smaller companies with the potential for high
growth. Nasdaq also operates the Nasdaq OTC Bulletin Board, which lists quotes

kets, see Web Extension

6The NYSE is actually a modified auction market, wherein people (through their brokers) bid for stocks.
Originally—about 200 years ago—brokers would literally shout, “I have 100 shares of Erie for sale; how
much am I offered?” and then sell to the highest bidder. If a broker had a buy order, he or she would
shout, “I want to buy 100 shares of Erie; who’ll sell at the best price?” The same general situation still
exists, although the exchanges now have members known as specialists who facilitate the trading process
by keeping an inventory of shares of the stocks in which they specialize. If a buy order comes in at a time
when no sell order arrives, the specialist will sell off some inventory. Similarly, if a sell order comes in, the
specialist will buy and add to inventory. The specialist sets a bid price (the price the specialist will pay for
the stock) and an asked price (the price at which shares will be sold out of inventory). The bid and asked
prices are set at levels designed to keep the inventory in balance. If many buy orders start coming in
because of favorable developments or sell orders come in because of unfavorable events, the specialist
will raise or lower prices to keep supply and demand in balance. Bid prices are somewhat lower than
asked prices, with the difference, or spread, representing the specialist’s profit margin.
Special facilities are available to help institutional investors such as mutual funds or pension funds sell
large blocks of stock without depressing their prices. In essence, brokerage houses that cater to institu-
tional clients will purchase blocks (defined as 10,000 or more shares) and then resell the stock to other in-
stitutions or individuals. Also, when a firm has a major announcement that is likely to cause its stock price
to change sharply, it will ask the exchanges to halt trading in its stock until the announcement has been
made and digested by investors. See Web Extension 1B on the textbook’s Web site for more on specialists
and trading off the exchange floor.

for stocks that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
but are not listed on any exchange, usually because the company is too small or not
sufficiently profitable.7 Finally, Nasdaq operates the Pink Sheets, which provide
quotes on companies that are not registered with the SEC.
Measuring the Market
A stock index is designed to show the performance of the
stock market. Here we describe some leading indexes.
Dow Jones Industrial Average
Begun in 1896, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
now includes 30 widely held stocks that represent al-
most a fifth of the market value of all U.S. stocks. See
http://www.dowjones.com for more information.
S&P 500 Index
Created in 1926, the S&P 500 Index is widely regarded
as the standard for measuring large-cap U.S. stocks’
market performance. It is value weighted, so the largest
companies (in terms of value) have the greatest influ-
ence. The S&P 500 Index is used as a comparison
benchmark by 97% of all U.S. money managers and
pension plan sponsors. See http://www2.standardand
poors.com for more information.
Nasdaq Composite Index
The Nasdaq Composite Index measures the performance
of all common stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock market.
Currently, it includes more than 3,200 companies, many
of which are in the technology sector. Microsoft, Cisco
Systems, and Intel account for a high percentage of the
index’s value-weighted market capitalization. For this rea-
son, substantial movements in the same direction by
these three companies can move the entire index. See
http://www.nasdaq.com for more information.
NYSE Composite Index
The NYSE Composite Index measures the perfor-
mance of all common stocks listed on the NYSE. It is a
value-weighted
index
based
on
just
over
2,000
stocks that represent 77% of the total market capi-
talization of all publicly traded companies in the
United States. See http://www.nyse.com for more
information.
Trading the Market
Through the use of exchange traded funds (ETFs), it is
now possible to buy and sell the market in much the
same way as an individual stock. For example, the
Standard & Poor’s depository receipt (SPDR) is a
share of a fund that holds the stocks of all the compa-
nies in the S&P 500. SPDRs trade during regular
market hours, making it possible to buy or sell the
S&P 500 any time during the day. There are hundreds
of other ETFs, including ones for the Nasdaq, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average, gold stocks, utilities,
and so on.

7OTC stands for over-the-counter. Before Nasdaq, the quickest way to trade a stock that was not listed at
a physical location exchange was to find a brokerage firm that kept shares of that stock in inventory. The
stock certificates were actually kept in a safe and were literally passed over the counter when bought or
sold. Nowadays the certificates for almost all listed stocks and bonds in the United States are stored in a
vault, beneath Manhattan, that is operated by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC).
Most brokerage firms have an account with the DTCC, and most investors leave their stocks with their
brokers. Thus, when stocks are sold, the DTCC simply adjusts the accounts of the brokerage firms that
are involved, and no stock certificates are actually moved.
Chapter 1: An Overview of Financial Management and the Financial Environment

"Liquidity” is the ability to trade quickly at a net price (i.e., after any commissions)
that is close to the security’s recent market price. In a dealer market, such as Nasdaq,
a stock’s liquidity depends on the number and quality of the dealers who make a mar-
ket in the stock. Nasdaq has more than 400 dealers, most of whom make markets in a
large number of stocks. The typical stock has about 10 market makers, but some
stocks have more than 50 market makers. Obviously, there are more market makers,
and hence there is more liquidity, for the Nasdaq National Market than for the
SmallCap Market. Stocks listed on the OTC Bulletin Board or the Pink Sheets
have much less liquidity.
Competition in the Secondary Markets
There is intense competition between the NYSE, Nasdaq, and other international
stock exchanges—they all want the larger, more profitable companies to list on their
exchange. Since most of the largest U.S. companies trade on the NYSE, the market
capitalization of NYSE-traded stocks is much higher than for stocks traded on Nasdaq
(about $15.7 trillion compared with $4.0 trillion at the end of 2007). However, re-
ported volume (number of shares traded) is often larger on Nasdaq, and more
companies are listed on Nasdaq.8 For comparison, the market capitalizations for global
exchanges are $4.3 trillion in Tokyo, $3.9 trillion in London, $3.7 trillion in Shanghai,
$2.7 trillion in Hong Kong, $2.1 trillion in Germany, and $1.8 trillion in Bombay.
Interestingly, many high-tech companies such as Microsoft and Intel have re-
mained on Nasdaq even though they easily meet the listing requirements of the
NYSE. At the same time, however, other high-tech companies such as Gateway and
Iomega have left Nasdaq for the NYSE. Despite these defections, Nasdaq’s growth
over the past decade has been impressive. In an effort to become even more compet-
itive with the NYSE and with international markets, Nasdaq acquired one of the
leading ECNs, Instinet, in 2005. Moreover, in early 2006 Nasdaq made an offer to
acquire the London Stock Exchange (LSE), was rejected by the LSE, withdrew the
offer but retained the right to make a subsequent offer, and busily acquired additional
shares of stock in the LSE. In late 2006, Nasdaq made a second offer for the LSE
and again was rejected. Nasdaq ultimately ended up by selling most of its LSE shares
to Bourse Dubai, which owns about 28% of the LSE. Nasdaq did acquire the Nordic
exchange OMX, giving it an international presence. The combined company is now
known as the NASDAQ OMX Group.
Despite all the shifting ownerships of exchanges, one thing is clear—there will be
a continued consolidation in the securities exchange industry, with a blurring of the
lines between physical location exchanges and electronic exchanges.

1.12 STOCK MARKET RETURNS
During the period 1968–2008, the average annual return for the stock market, as
measured by total returns (dividends plus capital gains) on the S&P 500 index, was
about 10.6%, but this average does not reflect the considerable annual variation.

year-to-year risk by showing annual returns. Notice that stocks have had positive returns
in most years, but there have been several years with large losses. Stocks lost more than
40% of their value during 1973–1974 and again during 2000–2002, and they lost 37% of
their value in 2008 alone. We will examine risk in more detail later in the book, but even
a cursory glance at Figure 1-4 shows just how risky stocks can be!
U.S. stocks amount to only about 40% of the world’s stocks, and this is prompting
many U.S. investors to also hold foreign stocks. Analysts have long touted the bene-
fits of investing overseas, arguing that foreign stocks improve diversification and pro-
vide good growth opportunities. This has been true for many years, but it wasn’t the

case in 2008 and 2009. Table 1-2 shows returns in selected countries. Notice that all
the countries had negative returns. The table shows how each country’s stocks per-
formed in its local currency and in terms of the U.S. dollar. For example, in 2008
British (U.K.) stocks had a −32.5% return in their own currency, but that translated
into a −51.2% return to a U.S. investor; the difference was due to depreciation in the
British pound relative to the U.S. dollar. As this example shows, the results of foreign
investments depend in part on what happens in the foreign economy and in part on
movements in exchange rates. Indeed, when you invest overseas, you face two risks:
(1) that foreign stocks will decrease in their local markets and (2) that the currencies
in which you will be paid will fall relative to the dollar.
Even though foreign stocks have exchange rate risk, this by no means suggests that
investors should avoid them. Foreign investments do improve diversification, and it is
inevitable that there will be years when foreign stocks outperform U.S. domestic
stocks. When this occurs, U.S. investors will be glad they put some of their money
in overseas markets.

1.13 THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
Although the global economic crisis has many causes, mortgage securitization in the
2000s is certainly one culprit, so we begin with it.
The Globalization of Mortgage Market Securitization
A national TV program ran a documentary on the travails of Norwegian retirees re-
sulting from defaults on Florida mortgages. Your first reaction might be to wonder
how Norwegian retirees became financially involved with risky Florida mortgages.

Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

We will break the answer to that question into two parts. First, we will identify the
different links in the financial chain between the retirees and mortgagees. Second, we
will explain why there were so many weak links.
In the movie Jerry Maguire, Tom Cruise said “Show me the money!” That’s a
good way to start identifying the financial links, starting with a single home purchase
in Florida.
1. Home Purchase.
In exchange for cash, a seller in Florida turned over ownership
of a house to a buyer.
2. Mortgage Origination.
To get the cash used to purchase the house, the home
buyer signed a mortgage loan agreement and gave it to an “originator.” Years ago the
originator would probably have been an S&L or a bank, but more recently the origi-
nators have been specialized mortgage brokers, which was true in this case. The bro-
ker gathered and examined the borrower’s credit information, arranged for an
independent appraisal of the house’s value, handled the paperwork, and received a
fee for these services.
3. Securitization and Resecuritization.
In exchange for cash, the originator sold
the mortgage to a securitizing firm. For example, Merrill Lynch’s investment bank-
ing operation was a major player in securitizing loans. It would bundle large numbers
of mortgages into pools and then create new securities that had claims on the pools’
cash flows. Some claims were simple, such as a proportional share of a pool, and
some claims were more complex, such as a claim on all interest payments during the
first five years or a claim on only principal payments. More complicated claims were
entitled to a fixed payment, while other claims would receive payments only after the
“senior” claimants had been paid. These slices of the pool were called “tranches,”
which comes from a French word for slice.
Some of the tranches were themselves re-combined and then re-divided into secu-
rities called “collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)”, some of which were themselves
combined and subdivided into other securities, commonly called CDOs-squared. For
example, Lehman Brothers often bought different tranches, split them into CDOs of
differing risk, and then had the different CDOs rated by an agency like Moody’s or
Standard & Poor’s.
There are two very important points to notice. First, the process didn’t change the
total amount of risk embedded in the mortgages, but it did make it possible to create
some securities that were less risky than average and some that were more risky. Sec-
ond, each time a new security was created or rated, fees were being earned by the
investment banks and rating agencies.
4. The Investors.
In exchange for cash, the securitizing firms sold the newly cre-
ated securities to individual investors, hedge funds, college endowments, insurance
companies, and other financial institutions, including a pension fund in Norway.
Keep in mind that financial institutions are themselves funded by individuals, so
cash begins with individuals and flows through the system until it is eventually re-
ceived by the seller of the home. If all goes according to plan, payments on the mort-
gages eventually return to the individuals who originally provided the cash. But in
this case, the chain was broken by a wave of mortgage defaults, resulting in problems
for Norwegian retirees.
Students and managers often ask us, “What happened to all the money?” The
short answer is “It went from investors to home sellers, with fees being skimmed off
all along the way.”
Chapter 1: An Overview of Financial Management and the Financial Environment
37

Although the process is complex, in theory there is nothing inherently wrong with
it. In fact, it should, in theory, provide more funding for U.S. home purchasers, and
it should allow risk to be shifted to those best able to bear it. Unfortunately, this isn’t
the end of the story.
The Dark Side of Securitization: The Sub-Prime Mortgage
Meltdown
What caused the financial crisis? Entire books are now being written on this subject,
but we can identify a few of the culprits.
Regulators Approved Sub-Prime Standards.
In the 1980s and early 1990s, reg-
ulations did not permit a nonqualifying mortgage to be securitized, so most origina-
tors mandated that borrowers meet certain requirements, including having at least a
certain minimum level of income relative to the mortgage payments and a minimum
down payment relative to the size of the mortgage. But in the mid-1990s, Washing-
ton politicians wanted to extend home ownership to groups that traditionally had dif-
ficulty obtaining mortgages. To accomplish this, regulations were relaxed so that
nonqualifying mortgages could be securitized. Such loans are commonly called sub-
prime or Alt-A mortgages. Thus, riskier mortgages were soon being securitized and
sold to investors. Again, there was nothing inherently wrong, provided the two fol-
lowing questions were being answered in the affirmative: One, were home buyers
making sound decisions regarding their ability to repay the loans? And two, did the
ultimate investors recognize the additional risk? We now know that the answer to
both questions is a resounding “no.” Homeowners were signing mortgages that they
could not hope to repay, and investors treated these mortgages as if they were much
safer than they actually were.
The Fed Helped Fuel the Real Estate Bubble.
With more people able to get a
mortgage, including people who should not have obtained one, the demand for
homes increased. This alone would have driven up house prices. However, the Fed
also slashed interest rates to historic lows after 9/11 to prevent a recession, and it
kept them low for a long time. These low rates made mortgage payments lower,
which made home ownership seem even more affordable, again contributing to an
increase in the demand for housing. Figure 1-5 shows that the combination of lower
mortgage qualifications and lower interest rates caused house prices to skyrocket.
Thus, the Fed contributed to an artificial bubble in real estate.
Home Buyers Wanted More for Less.
Even with low interest rates, how could
sub-prime borrowers afford the mortgage payments, especially with house prices ris-
ing? First, most sub-prime borrowers chose an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) with
an interest rate based on a short-term rate, such as that on 1-year Treasury bonds, to
which the lender added a couple of percentage points. Because the Fed had pushed
short-term rates so low, the initial rates on ARMs were very low.
With a traditional fixed-rate mortgage, the payments remain fixed over time. But
with an ARM, an increase in market interest rates triggers higher monthly payments,
so an ARM is riskier than a fixed-rate mortgage. However, many borrowers chose an
even riskier mortgage, the “option ARM,” where the borrower can choose to make
such low payments during the first couple of years that they don’t even cover the inter-
est, causing the loan balance to actually increase each month! At a later date, the pay-
ments would be reset to reflect both the current market interest rate and the higher
loan balance. For example, in some cases a monthly payment of $948 for the first
38
Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

32 months was reset to $2,454 for the remaining 328 months (we provide the calcula-
tions for this example in Chapter 4).
Why would anyone who couldn’t afford to make a $2,454 monthly payment choose
an option ARM? Here are three possible reasons. First, some borrowers simply didn’t
understand the situation and were victims of predatory lending practices by brokers ea-
ger to earn fees regardless of the consequences. Second, some borrowers thought that
the home price would go up enough to allow them to sell at a profit or else refinance
with another low-payment loan. Third, some people were simply greedy and short-
sighted, and they wanted to live in a better home than they could afford.
Mortgage Brokers Didn’t Care.
Years ago, S&Ls and banks had a vested inter-
est in the mortgages they originated because they held them for the life of the loan—
up to 30 years. If a mortgage went bad, the bank or S&L would lose money, so they
were careful to verify that the borrower would be able to repay the loan. In the bub-
ble years, though, over 80% of mortgages were arranged by independent mortgage
brokers who received a commission. Thus, the broker’s incentive was to complete
deals even if the borrowers couldn’t make the payments after the soon-to-come reset.
So it’s easy to understand (but not to approve!) why brokers pushed deals onto bor-
rowers who were almost certain to default eventually.
Real Estate Appraisers Were Lax.
The relaxed regulations didn’t require the
mortgage broker to verify the borrower’s income, so these loans were called “liar

loans” because the borrowers could overstate their income. But even in these cases
the broker had to get an appraisal showing that the house’s value was greater than
the loan amount. Many real estate appraisers simply assumed that house prices would
keep going up, so they were willing to appraise houses at unrealistically high values.
Like the mortgage brokers, they were paid at the time of their service. Other than
damage to their reputations, they weren’t concerned if the borrower later defaulted
and the value of the house turned out to be less than the remaining loan balance,
causing a loss for the lender.
Originators and Securitizers Wanted Quantity, not Quality.
Originating in-
stitutions like Countrywide Financial and New Century Mortgage made money when
they sold the mortgages, long before any of the mortgages defaulted. The same is true
for securitizing firms such as Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman Brothers.
Their incentives were to generate volume originating loans, not to make sure the loans
should have been made. This started at the top—CEOs and other top executives re-
ceived stock options and bonuses based on their firms’ profits, and profits depended
on volume. Thus, the top officers pushed their subordinates to generate volume, those
subordinates pushed the originators to write more mortgages, and the originators
pushed the appraisers to come up with high values.
Rating Agencies Were Lax.
Investors who purchased the complicated mortgage
backed securities wanted to know how risky they were, so they insisted on seeing the
bonds’ “ratings.” Rating agencies were paid to investigate the details of each bond
and to assign a rating which reflected the security’s risk. The securitizing firms paid
the rating agencies to do the ratings. For example, Lehman Brothers hired Moody’s
to rate some of their CDOs. Indeed, the investment banks would actually pay for ad-
vice from the rating agencies as they were designing the securities. The rating and
consulting activities were extremely lucrative for the agencies, which ignored the
obvious conflict of interest: The investment bank wanted a high rating, the rating
agency got paid to help design securities that would qualify for a high rating, and
high ratings led to continued business for the raters.
Insurance Wasn’t Insurance.
To provide a higher rating and make these
mortgage-backed securities look even more attractive to investors, the issuers would
frequently purchase a type of insurance policy on the security called a credit default
swap. For example, suppose you had wanted to purchase a CDO from Lehman
Brothers but were worried about the risk. What if Lehman Brothers had agreed to
pay an annual fee to an insurance company like AIG, which would guarantee the
CDO’s payments if the underlying mortgages defaulted? You probably would have
felt confident enough to buy the CDO.
But any similarity to a conventional insurance policy ends here. Unlike home in-
surance, where there is a single policyholder and a single insurer, totally uninvolved
speculators can also make bets on your CDO by either selling or purchasing credit
default swaps on the CDO. For example, a hedge fund could buy a credit default
swap on your CDO if it thinks the CDO will default; or an investment bank like
Bear Stearns could sell a swap, betting that the CDO won’t default. In fact, the In-
ternational Swaps and Derivatives Association estimates that in mid-2008 there was
about $54 trillion in credit default swaps. This staggering amount is approximately
7 times the value of all U.S. mortgages, over 4 times the level of the U.S. national
debt, and over twice the value of the entire U.S. stock market.
Another big difference is that home insurance companies are highly regulated, but
there was virtually no regulation in the credit default swap market. The players
40
Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

traded directly among themselves, with no central clearinghouse. It was almost im-
possible to tell how much risk any of the players had taken on, making it impossible
to know whether or not counterparties like AIG would be able to fulfill their obliga-
tions in the event of a CDO default. And that made it impossible to know the value
of CDOs held by many banks, which in turn made it impossible to judge whether or
not those banks were de facto bankrupt.
Rocket Scientists Had Poor Rearview Mirrors.
Brilliant financial experts, often
trained in physics and hired from rocket science firms, built elegant models to deter-
mine the value of these new securities. Unfortunately, a model is only as good as its
inputs. The experts looked at the high growth rates of recent real estate prices (see
Figure 1-5) and assumed that future growth rates also would be high. These high
growth rates caused models to calculate very high CDO prices, at least until the real
estate market crumbled.
Investors Wanted More for Less.
In the early 2000s, low-rated debt (including
mortgage-backed securities), hedge funds, and private equity funds produced
great rates of return. Many investors jumped into this debt to keep up with the
Joneses. As shown in Chapter 5 when we discuss bond ratings and bond spreads,
investors began lowering the premium they required for taking on extra risk.
Thus, investors focused primarily on returns and largely ignored risk. In fairness,
some investors assumed the credit ratings were accurate, and they trusted the re-
presentatives of the investment banks selling the securities. In retrospect, however,
Warren Buffett’s maxim that “I only invest in companies I understand” seems wiser
than ever.
The Emperor Has No Clothes.
In 2006, many of the option ARMs began to re-
set, borrowers began to default, and home prices first leveled off and then began to
fall. Things got worse in 2007 and 2008, and by early 2009, almost 1 out of 10 mort-
gages was in default or foreclosure, resulting in displaced families and virtual ghost
towns of new subdivisions. As homeowners defaulted on their mortgages, so did the
CDOs backed by the mortgages. That brought down the counterparties like AIG
who had insured the CDOs via credit default swaps. Virtually overnight, investors
realized that mortgage-backed security default rates were headed higher and that
the houses used as collateral were worth less than the mortgages. Mortgage-backed
security prices plummeted, investors quit buying newly securitized mortgages, and
liquidity in the secondary market disappeared. Thus, the investors who owned these
securities were stuck with pieces of paper that were substantially lower than the va-
lues reported on their balance sheets.
From Sub-Prime Meltdown to Liquidity
Crisis to Economic Crisis
Like the Andromeda strain, the sub-prime meltdown went viral, and it ended up in-
fecting almost all aspects of the economy. Financial institutions were the first to fall.
Many originating firms had not sold all of their sub-prime mortgages, and they
failed. For example, New Century declared bankruptcy in 2007, IndyMac was placed
under FDIC control in 2008, and Countrywide was acquired by Bank of America in
2008 to avoid bankruptcy.
Securitizing firms also crashed, partly because they kept some of the new securities
they created. For example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had huge losses on their
portfolio assets, causing them to be virtually taken over by the Federal Housing
Chapter 1: An Overview of Financial Management and the Financial Environment
41

Finance Agency in 2008. In addition to big losses on their own sub-prime portfolios,
many investment banks also had losses related to their positions in credit default
swaps. Thus, Lehman Brothers was forced into bankruptcy, Bear Stearns was sold
to JPMorgan Chase, and Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America, with huge
losses to their stockholders.
Because Lehman Brothers defaulted on some of its commercial paper, investors in
the Reserve Primary Fund, a big money market mutual fund, saw the value of its in-
vestments “break the buck,” dropping to less than a dollar per share. To avoid panic
and a total lockdown in the money markets, the U.S. Treasury agreed to insure some
investments in money market funds.
AIG was the number one backer of credit default swaps, and it operated world-
wide. In 2008 it became obvious that AIG could not honor its commitments as a
counterparty, so the Fed effectively nationalized AIG to avoid a domino effect in
which AIG’s failure would topple hundreds of other financial institutions.
In normal times, banks provide liquidity to the economy and funding for credit-
worthy businesses and individuals. These activities are absolutely crucial for a well-
functioning economy. However, the financial contagion spread to commercial
banks because some owned mortgage-backed securities, some owned commercial
paper issued by failing institutions, and some had exposure to credit default swaps.
As banks worried about their survival in the fall of 2008, they stopped providing
credit to other banks and businesses. The market for commercial paper dried up
to such an extent that the Fed began buying new commercial paper from issuing
companies.
Banks also began hoarding cash rather than lending it. The Fed requires banks
to keep 10% of the funds they raise from depositors on “reserve.” Banks use the
other 90% to make loans or to buy securities. In aggregate, there usually has
been about $9 billion in excess reserves—that is, reserves over and above the 10%
they are required to keep on hand. However, at the end of 2008, banks held over
$770 billion in excess reserves compared to $75 billion in required reserves. This
hoarding may have reduced the banks’ risk, but it deprived the economy of a much
needed capital.
Consequently, there has been a reduction in construction, manufacturing, retail-
ing, and consumption, all of which caused job losses in 2008 and 2009, with more
expected in the future. In short, this has led to a serious recession in the United
States and most of the developed world, a recession that brings back memories of
the Great Depression of the 1930s.

1.14 THE BIG PICTURE
Finance has a lot of vocabulary and tools that might be new to you. To help you
avoid getting bogged down in the trenches, Figure 1-6 presents the “big picture.”
A manager’s primary job is to increase the company’s intrinsic value, but how exactly
does one go about doing that? The equation in the center of Figure 1-6 shows that
intrinsic value is the present value of the firm’s expected free cash flows, discounted
at the weighted average cost of capital. Thus, there are two approaches for increasing
intrinsic value: Improve FCF or reduce the WACC. Observe that several factors af-
fect FCF and several factors affect the WACC. In the rest of the book’s chapters, we
will typically focus on only one of these factors, systematically building the vocabu-
42
Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

lary and tools that you will use after graduation to improve your company’s intrinsic
value. It is true that every manager needs to understand financial vocabulary and be
able to apply financial tools, but really successful managers also understand how their
decisions affect the big picture. So as you read this book, keep in mind where each
topic fits into the big picture.

Summary
•
The three main forms of business organization are the proprietorship, the
partnership, and the corporation. Although each form of organization offers
advantages and disadvantages, corporations conduct much more business than the other
forms.
•
The primary objective of management should be to maximize stockholders’ wealth,
and this means maximizing the company’s fundamental, or intrinsic, stock price.
Legal actions that maximize stock prices usually increase social welfare.
•
Free cash flows (FCFs) are the cash flows available for distribution to all of a
firm’s investors (shareholders and creditors) after the firm has paid all expenses
(including taxes) and has made the required investments in operations to support
growth.
•
The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the average return required
by all of the firm’s investors. It is determined by the firm’s capital structure (the
firm’s relative amounts of debt and equity), interest rates, the firm’s risk, and the
market’s attitude toward risk.
•
The value of a firm depends on the size of the firm’s free cash flows, the timing
of those flows, and their risk. A firm’s fundamental, or intrinsic, value is de-

Transfers of capital between borrowers and savers take place (1) by direct
transfers of money and securities; (2) by transfers through investment banking
houses, which act as go-betweens; and (3) by transfers through financial
intermediaries, which create new securities.
•
Four fundamental factors affect the cost of money: (1) production opportunities,
(2) time preferences for consumption, (3) risk, and (4) inflation.
•
Derivatives, such as options, are claims on other financial securities. In
securitization, new securities are created from claims on packages of other
securities.
•
Major financial institutions include commercial banks, savings and loan asso-
ciations, mutual savings banks, credit unions, pension funds, life insurance
companies, mutual funds, money market funds, hedge funds, and private
equity funds.
•
Spot markets and futures markets are terms that refer to whether the assets
are bought or sold for “on-the-spot” delivery or for delivery at some future date.
•
Money markets are the markets for debt securities with maturities of less than a
year. Capital markets are the markets for long-term debt and corporate stocks.
•
Primary markets are the markets in which corporations raise new capital.
Secondary markets are markets in which existing, already outstanding securities
are traded among investors.
•
Orders from buyers and sellers can be matched in one of three ways: (1) in an
open outcry auction, (2) through dealers, and (3) automatically through an
electronic communications network (ECN).

Financial Statements, Cash
Flow, and Taxes

ven in today’s era of financial crises, $14.6 billion is a lot of money. This
is the amount of cash flow that Hewlett-Packard’s (HP) operations
generated in 2008, up from $9.6 billion in 2007, despite the recession.
The ability to generate cash flow is the lifeblood of a company and the
basis for its fundamental value. How did HP use this cash flow? HP
invested for the future by making over $11 billion in acquisitions.
Other companies also generated large cash flows from operations in
2008, but they used the money differently. For example, Walgreens
generated over $3 billion from its operations and used over $2 billion for
capital expenditures, much of it on new stores and the purchase of
worksite health centers.
Procter & Gamble generated $15.8 billion. P&G made relatively small
capital expenditures (abut $3 billion) and returned the lion’s share (over
$12 billion) to shareholders as dividends or through stock repurchases.
Apple generated about $9.6 billion (up from $5.5 billion the previous
year) but made relatively small capital expenditures, acquisitions, or
distributions to shareholders. Instead, it put about $9.1 billion into short-
term financial securities like T-bills.
These four well-managed companies used their operating cash flows in
four different ways: HP made acquisitions, Walgreens spent on a mix of
internal and external growth, P&G returned cash to shareholders, and
Apple saved for a rainy day. Which company made the right choice? Only
time will tell, but keep these companies and their different cash flow
strategies in mind as you read this chapter.
47

A manager’s primary goal is to maximize the fundamental, or intrinsic, value of the
firm’s stock. This value is based on the stream of cash flows the firm is expected to
generate in the future. But how does an investor go about estimating future cash
flows, and how does a manager decide which actions are most likely to increase cash
flows? The first step is to understand the financial statements that publicly traded
firms must provide to the public. Thus, we begin with a discussion of financial state-
ments, including how to interpret them and how to use them. Because value depends
on usable, after-tax cash flows, we highlight the difference between accounting in-
come and cash flow. In fact, it is after-tax cash flow that is important, so we also pro-
vide an overview of the federal income tax system.
2.1 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REPORTS
A company’s annual report usually begins with the chairman’s description of the
firm’s operating results during the past year and a discussion of new developments
that will affect future operations. The annual report also presents four basic financial
statements—the balance sheet, the income statement, the statement of stockholders’ equity,
and the statement of cash flows.1
Intrinsic Value, Free Cash Flow, and Financial Statements
In Chapter 1, we told you that managers should strive to
make their firms more valuable and that the intrinsic
value of a firm is determined by the present value of
its free cash flows (FCF) discounted at the weighted av-
erage cost of capital (WACC). This chapter focuses on
FCF, including its calculation from financial statements
and its interpretation when evaluating a company and
manager.

The quantitative and written materials are equally important. The financial state-
ments report what has actually happened to assets, earnings, dividends, and cash flows
during the past few years, whereas the written materials attempt to explain why
things turned out the way they did.
For illustrative purposes, we use a hypothetical company, MicroDrive Inc., which
produces hard drives for microcomputers. Formed in 1982, MicroDrive has grown
steadily and has a reputation as one of the best firms in the microcomputer compo-
nents industry.

What four types of financial statements are typically included in the annual report?
2.2 THE BALANCE SHEET
Table 2-1 shows MicroDrive’s most recent balance sheets, which represent “snapshots”
of its financial position on the last day of each year. Although most companies report
their balance sheets only on the last day of a given period, the “snapshot” actually
changes daily as inventories are bought and sold, as fixed assets are added or retired, or
as loan balances are increased or paid down. Moreover, a retailer will have much larger
inventories before Christmas than later in the spring, so balance sheets for the same
company can look quite different at different times during the year.
The left side of a balance sheet lists assets, which are the “things” the company
owns. They are listed in order of “liquidity,” or length of time it typically takes to
convert them to cash at fair market values. The right side lists the claims that various
groups have against the company’s value, listed in the order in which they must be
paid. For example, suppliers may have a claim called “accounts payable” that is due
within 30 days, banks may have claims called “notes payable” that are due within 90
days, and bondholders may have claims that are not due for 20 years or more.
Stockholders come last, for two reasons. First, their claim represents ownership (or
equity) and need never be “paid off.” Second, they have a residual claim in the sense
that they may receive payments only if the other claimants have already been paid. The
nonstockholder claims are liabilities from the stockholders’ perspective. The amounts
shown on the balance sheets are called book values because they are based on the
amounts recorded by bookkeepers when assets are purchased or liabilities are issued. As
you will see throughout this textbook, book values may be very different from market
values, which are the current values as determined in the marketplace.

The following sections provide more information about specific asset, liability, and
equity accounts.
Assets
Cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and inventories are listed as current
assets because MicroDrive is expected to convert them into cash within a year. All assets
are stated in dollars, but only cash represents actual money that can be spent. Some mar-
ketable securities mature very soon, and these can be converted quickly into cash at
prices close to their book values. Such securities are called “cash equivalents” and are
included with cash. Therefore, MicroDrive could write checks for a total of $10 million.
Other types of marketable securities have a longer time until maturity, and their market
values are less predictable. These securities are classified as “short-term investments.”
When MicroDrive sells its products to a customer but doesn’t demand immediate
payment, the customer then has an obligation called an “account receivable.” The
$375 million shown in accounts receivable is the amount of sales for which MicroDrive
has not yet been paid.
Inventories show the dollars MicroDrive has invested in raw materials, work-
in-process, and finished goods available for sale. MicroDrive uses the FIFO (first-
in, first-out) method to determine the inventory value shown on its balance sheet
($615 million). It could have used the LIFO (last-in, first-out) method. During a
period of rising prices, by taking out old, low-cost inventory and leaving in new,
high-cost items, FIFO will produce a higher balance sheet inventory value but a
lower cost of goods sold on the income statement. (This is strictly used for account-
ing; companies actually use older items first.) Because MicroDrive uses FIFO and be-
cause inflation has been occurring: (1) its balance sheet inventories are higher than
they would have been had it used LIFO, (2) its cost of goods sold is lower than it
would have been under LIFO, and (3) its reported profits are therefore higher. In
MicroDrive’s case, if the company had elected to switch to LIFO, then its balance
sheet would have inventories of $585 million rather than $615 million and its earn-
ings (discussed in the next section) would have been reduced by $18 million. Thus,
the inventory valuation method can have a significant effect on financial statements,
which is important to know when comparing different companies.
Rather than treat the entire purchase price of a long-term asset (such as a factory,
plant, or equipment) as an expense in the purchase year, accountants “spread” the pur-
chase cost over the asset’s useful life.2 The amount they charge each year is called the
depreciation expense. Some companies report an amount called “gross plant and equip-
ment,” which is the total cost of the long-term assets they have in place, and another
amount called “accumulated depreciation,” which is the total amount of depreciation
that has been charged on those assets. Some companies, such as MicroDrive, report
only net plant and equipment, which is gross plant and equipment less accumulated de-
preciation. Chapter 11 provides a more detailed explanation of depreciation methods.
Liabilities and Equity
Accounts payable, notes payable, and accruals are listed as current liabilities because
MicroDrive is expected to pay them within a year. When MicroDrive purchases sup-
plies but doesn’t immediately pay for them, it takes on an obligation called an
account payable. Similarly, when MicroDrive takes out a loan that must be repaid
within a year, it signs an IOU called a note payable. MicroDrive doesn’t pay its taxes
2This is called accrual accounting, which attempts to match revenues to the periods in which they are
earned and expenses to the periods in which the effort to generate income occurred.

Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

or its employees’ wages daily, and the amount it owes on these items at any point in
time is called an “accrual” or an “accrued expense.” Long-term bonds are also liabili-
ties because they, too, reflect a claim held by someone other than a stockholder.
Preferred stock is a hybrid, or a cross between common stock and debt. In the event
of bankruptcy, preferred stock ranks below debt but above common stock. Also, the
preferred dividend is fixed, so preferred stockholders do not benefit if the company’s
earnings grow. Most firms do not use much, or even any, preferred stock, so “equity”
usually means “common equity” unless the words “total” or “preferred” are included.
When a company sells shares of stock, the proceeds are recorded in the common
stock account.3 Retained earnings are the cumulative amount of earnings that have not
been paid out as dividends. The sum of common stock and retained earnings is called
“common equity,” or sometimes just equity. If a company’s assets could actually be sold
at their book value, and if the liabilities and preferred stock were actually worth their
book values, then a company could sell its assets, pay off its liabilities and preferred stock,
and the remaining cash would belong to common stockholders. Therefore, common eq-
uity is sometimes called net worth—it’s the assets net of the liabilities.

THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
Let’s Play Hide-and-Seek!
In a shameful lapse of regulatory accountability, banks
and other financial institutions were allowed to use
“structured investment vehicles” (SIVs) to hide assets
and liabilities off their balance sheets and simply not
report them. Here’s how SIVs worked and why they
subsequently failed. The SIV was set up as a separate
legal entity that the bank owned and managed. The SIV
would borrow money in the short-term market (backed
by the credit of the bank) and then invest in long-term
securities. As you might guess, many SIVs invested in
mortgage-backed securities. When the SIV paid only 3%
on its borrowings but earned 10% on its investments,
the managing bank was able to report fabulous earn-
ings, especially if it also earned fees for creating the
mortgage securities that went into the SIV.
But this game of hide-and-seek doesn’t have a happy
ending. Mortgage-backed securities began defaulting in
2007 and 2008, causing the SIVs to pass losses through
to the banks. SunTrust, Citigroup, Bank of America, and
Northern Rock are just a few of the many banks that re-
ported enormous losses in the SIV game. Investors, de-
positors, and the government eventually found the
hidden assets and liabilities, but by then the assets were
worth a lot less than the liabilities.
In a case of too little and too late, regulators are clos-
ing these loopholes, and it doesn’t look like there will be
any more SIVs in the near future. But the damage has
been done, and the entire financial system is at risk in
large part because of this high-stakes game of hide-
and-seek.
3Companies sometimes break the total proceeds into two parts, one called “par” and the other called
“paid-in capital” or “capital surplus.” For example, if a company sells shares of stock for $10, it might re-
cord $1 of par and $9 of paid-in capital. For most purposes, the distinction between par and paid-in capi-
tal is not important, and most companies use no-par stock.

2.3 THE INCOME STATEMENT
Table 2-2 shows the income statements for MicroDrive. Income statements can
cover any period of time, but they are usually prepared monthly, quarterly, and an-
nually. Unlike the balance sheet, which is a snapshot of a firm at a point in time, the
income statement reflects performance during the period.
Subtracting operating costs from net sales but excluding depreciation and amorti-
zation results in EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, taxes, deprecia-
tion, and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are annual charges that reflect
the estimated costs of the assets used up each year. Depreciation applies to tangible

assets, such as plant and equipment, whereas amortization applies to intangible assets
such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, and goodwill.4 Because neither depreciation
nor amortization is paid in cash, some analysts claim that EBITDA is a better mea-
sure of financial strength than is net income. However, as we show later in the chap-
ter, EBITDA is not as important as free cash flow. In fact, some financial wags have
stated that EBITDA really stands for “earnings before anything bad happens.”
The net income available to common shareholders, which is revenues less ex-
penses, taxes, and preferred dividends (but before paying common dividends), is gen-
erally referred to as net income, although it is also called profit or earnings,
particularly in the news or financial press. Dividing net income by the number of
shares outstanding gives earnings per share (EPS), which is often called “the bottom
line.” Throughout this book, unless otherwise indicated, net income means net in-
come available to common stockholders.5

2.4 STATEMENT OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Changes in stockholders’ equity during the accounting period are reported in the
statement of stockholders’ equity. Table 2-3 shows that MicroDrive earned
$113.5 million during 2010, paid out $57.5 million in common dividends, and plowed
$56 million back into the business. Thus, the balance sheet item “Retained earnings”
increased from $710 million at year-end 2009 to $766 million at year-end 2010.6 The
last column shows the beginning stockholders’ equity, any changes, and the end-
of-year stockholders’ equity.
Note that “retained earnings” does not represent assets but is instead a claim
against assets. In 2010, MicroDrive’s stockholders allowed it to reinvest $56 million
instead of distributing the money as dividends, and management spent this money
4The accounting treatment of goodwill resulting from mergers has changed in recent years. Rather than
an annual charge, companies are required to periodically evaluate the value of goodwill and reduce net in-
come only if the goodwill’s value has decreased materially (“become impaired,” in the language of accoun-
tants). For example, in 2002 AOL Time Warner wrote off almost $100 billion associated with the AOL
merger. It doesn’t take too many $100 billion expenses to really hurt net income!
5Companies also report “comprehensive income,” which is the sum of net income and any “comprehen-
sive” income item, such as unrealized gain or loss when an asset is marked-to-market. For our examples,
we assume that there are no comprehensive income items.
Some companies also choose to report “pro forma income.” For example, if a company incurs an ex-
pense that it doesn’t expect to recur, such as the closing of a plant, it might calculate pro forma income
as though it had not incurred the one-time expense. There are no hard-and-fast rules for calculating pro
forma income, so many companies find ingenious ways to make pro forma income higher than traditional
income. The SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) are taking steps to re-
duce deceptive uses of pro forma reporting.
6If they had been applicable, then columns would have been used to show “Additional Paid-in Capital”
and “Treasury Stock.” Also, additional rows would have contained information on such things as new is-
sues of stock, treasury stock acquired or reissued, stock options exercised, and unrealized foreign exchange
gains or losses.

on new assets. Thus, retained earnings, as reported on the balance sheet, does not
represent cash and is not “available” for the payment of dividends or anything else.7
Self-Test
What is the statement of stockholders’ equity, and what information does it provide?
Why do changes in retained earnings occur?
Explain why the following statement is true: “The retained earnings reported on the
balance sheet does not represent cash and is not available for the payment of divi-
dends or anything else.”
A firm had a retained earnings balance of $3 million in the previous year. In the
current year, its net income is $2.5 million. If it pays $1 million in common
dividends in the current year, what is its resulting retained earnings balance?
($4.5 million)
2.5 NET CASH FLOW
A business’s net cash flow generally differs from its accounting profit because
some of the revenues and expenses listed on the income statement were not re-
ceived or paid in cash during the year. The relationship between net cash flow
and net income is:
Net cash flow ¼ Net income −Noncash revenues þ Noncash charges
(2-1)
The primary examples of noncash charges are depreciation and amortization.
These items reduce net income but are not paid out in cash, so we add them back
to net income when calculating net cash flow. Another example of a noncash charge
is deferred taxes. In some instances, companies are allowed to defer tax payments to a
later date even though the tax payment is reported as an expense on the income
statement. Therefore, deferred tax payments are added to net income when calculat-

7The amount reported in the retained earnings account is not an indication of the amount of cash the
firm has. Cash (as of the balance sheet date) is found in the cash account, an asset account. A positive
number in the retained earnings account indicates only that in the past the firm earned some income,
but its dividends paid were less than its earnings. Even though a company reports record earnings and
shows an increase in its retained earnings account, it still may be short of cash.
The same situation holds for individuals. You might own a new BMW (no loan), lots of clothes, and
an expensive stereo—and hence have a high net worth—but if you have only 23 cents in your pocket
plus $5 in your checking account, you will still be short of cash.

Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

ing net cash flow.8 Sometimes a customer will purchase services or products that ex-
tend beyond the reporting date, such as iPhone subscriptions at Apple. Even if the
company collects the cash at the time of the purchase, the company will spread the
reported revenues over the life of the purchase. This causes income to be lower than
cash flow in the first year and higher in any subsequent years, so adjustments are
made when calculating net cash flow.
Depreciation and amortization usually are the largest noncash items, and in many
cases the other noncash items roughly net out to zero. For this reason, many analysts
assume that net cash flow equals net income plus depreciation and amortization:
Net cash flow ¼ Net income þ Depreciation and amortization
(2-2)
We will generally assume that Equation 2-2 holds. However, you should remember
that Equation 2-2 will not accurately reflect net cash flow when there are significant
noncash items other than depreciation and amortization.
We can illustrate Equation 2-2 with 2010 data for MicroDrive taken from Table 2-2:
Net cash flow ¼ $113:5 þ $100:0 ¼ $213:5 million
To illustrate depreciation’s effect, suppose a machine with a life of 5 years and
zero expected salvage value was purchased in late 2009 for $100,000 and placed into
service in early 2010. This $100,000 cost is not expensed in the purchase year; rather,
it is charged against production over the machine’s 5-year depreciable life. If the de-
preciation expense were not taken, then profits would be overstated and taxes would
be too high. Therefore, the annual depreciation charge is deducted from sales reven-
ues, along with such other costs as labor and raw materials, to determine income.
However, because the $100,000 was actually expended back in 2009, the depreciation
charged against income in 2010 and subsequent years is not a cash outflow. Deprecia-
tion is a noncash charge, so it must be added back to net income to obtain the net cash flow. If
we assume that all other noncash items (including amortization) sum to zero, then
net cash flow is simply equal to net income plus depreciation.

2.6 STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
Even if a company reports a large net income during a year, the amount of cash reported
on its year-end balance sheet may be the same or even lower than its beginning cash.
The reason is that its net income can be used in a variety of ways, not just kept as cash
in the bank. For example, the firm may use its net income to pay dividends, to increase
inventories, to finance accounts receivable, to invest in fixed assets, to reduce debt, or to
buy back common stock. Indeed, the company’s cash position as reported on its balance
sheet is affected by a great many factors, which include the following.
1. Net income before preferred dividends. Other things held constant, a positive
net income will lead to more cash in the bank. However, as we shall discuss,
other things generally are not held constant.
8Deferred taxes may arise, for example, if a company uses accelerated depreciation for tax purposes but
straight-line depreciation for reporting its financial statements to investors. If deferred taxes are increas-
ing, then the company is paying less in taxes than it reports to the public.

2. Noncash adjustments to net income. To calculate cash flow, it is necessary to
adjust net income to reflect noncash revenues and expenses, such as depreciation
and deferred taxes, as shown previously in the calculation of net cash flow.
3. Changes in working capital. Increases in current assets other than cash (such
as inventories and accounts receivable) decrease cash, whereas decreases in

these accounts increase cash. For example, if inventories are to increase, then
the firm must use some of its cash to acquire the additional inventory. Con-
versely, if inventories decrease, this generally means the firm is selling inven-
tories and not replacing all of them, hence generating cash. On the other
hand, if payables increase then the firm has received additional credit from
its suppliers, which saves cash, but if payables decrease, this means it has
used cash to pay off its suppliers. Therefore, increases in current liabilities
such as accounts payable increase cash, whereas decreases in current liabilities
decrease cash.
4. Investments. If a company invests in fixed assets or short-term financial invest-
ments, this will reduce its cash position. On the other hand, if it sells some fixed
assets or short-term investments, this will increase cash.
5. Security transactions and dividend payments. If a company issues stock or
bonds during the year, the funds raised will increase its cash position. On the
other hand, if the company uses cash to buy back outstanding stock or to pay
off debt, or if it pays dividends to its shareholders, this will reduce cash.
Each of these five factors is reflected in the statement of cash flows, which sum-
marizes the changes in a company’s cash position. The statement separates activities
into three categories, plus a summary section, as follows.
1. Operating activities, which includes net income, depreciation, changes in current
assets and liabilities other than cash, short-term investments, and short-term debt.
2. Investing activities, which includes investments in or sales of fixed assets and
short-term financial investments.
3. Financing activities, which includes raising cash by issuing short-term debt,
long-term debt, or stock. Also, because dividend payments, stock repurchases,
and principal payments on debt reduce a company’s cash, such transactions are
included here.
Accounting texts explain how to prepare the statement of cash flows, but the state-
ment is used to help answer questions such as these: Is the firm generating enough
cash to purchase the additional assets required for growth? Is the firm generating
any extra cash that can be used to repay debt or to invest in new products? Such in-
formation is useful both for managers and investors, so the statement of cash flows is
an important part of the annual report.
Table 2-4 shows MicroDrive’s statement of cash flows as it would appear in the
company’s annual report. The top section shows cash generated by and used in
operations—for MicroDrive, operations provided net cash flows of minus $2.5 mil-
lion. This subtotal, the minus $2.5 million net cash flow provided by operating ac-
tivities, is in many respects the most important figure in any of the financial
statements. Profits as reported on the income statement can be “doctored” by such
tactics as depreciating assets too slowly, not recognizing bad debts promptly, and the
like. However, it is far more difficult to simultaneously doctor profits and the work-
ing capital accounts. Therefore, it is not uncommon for a company to report posi-
tive net income right up to the day it declares bankruptcy. In such cases, however,
the net cash flow from operations almost always began to deteriorate much earlier,
and analysts who kept an eye on cash flow could have predicted trouble. Therefore,
if you are ever analyzing a company and are pressed for time, look first at the trend
in net cash flow provided by operating activities, because it will tell you more than
any other number.
Chapter 2: Financial Statements, Cash Flow, and Taxes

The second section shows investing activities. MicroDrive purchased fixed assets
totaling $230 million and sold $65 million of short-term investments, for a net cash
flow from investing activities of minus $165 million.
The third section, financing activities, includes borrowing from banks (notes payable),
selling new bonds, and paying dividends on common and preferred stock. MicroDrive
raised $224 million by borrowing, but it paid $61.5 million in preferred and common di-
vidends. Therefore, its net inflow of funds from financing activities was $162.5 million.
In the summary, when all of these sources and uses of cash are totaled, we see that
MicroDrive’s cash outflows exceeded its cash inflows by $5 million during 2010; that
is, its net change in cash was a negative $5 million.
MicroDrive’s statement of cash flows should be worrisome to its managers and to
outside analysts. The company had a $2.5 million cash shortfall from operations, it spent

aDepreciation is a noncash expense that was deducted when calculating net income. It must
be added back to show the correct cash flow from operations.
bAn increase in a current asset decreases cash. An increase in a current liability increases cash. For
example, inventories increased by $200 million and therefore reduced cash by a like amount.
cThe net increase in fixed assets is $130 million; however, this net amount is after a deduc-
tion for the year’s depreciation expense. Depreciation expense would have to be added
back to find the increase in gross fixed assets. From the company’s income statement, we
see that the 2010 depreciation expense is $100 million; thus, expenditures on fixed assets
were actually $230 million.

an additional $230 million on new fixed assets, and it paid out another $61.5 million in
dividends. It covered these cash outlays by borrowing heavily and by liquidating $65 mil-
lion of short-term investments. Obviously, this situation cannot continue year after year,
so something will have to be done. In Chapter 12, when we discuss financial planning,
we consider some of the actions that MicroDrive’s financial staff might recommend.9

2.7 MODIFYING ACCOUNTING DATA FOR MANAGERIAL
DECISIONS
Thus far in the chapter we have focused on financial statements as they are presented in
the annual report. When you studied income statements in accounting, the emphasis
was probably on the firm’s net income, which is its accounting profit. However, the
intrinsic value of a company’s operations is determined by the stream of cash flows that
the operations will generate now and in the future. To be more specific, the value of
operations depends on all the future expected free cash flows (FCF), defined as after-
tax operating profit minus the amount of new investment in working capital and fixed
assets necessary to sustain the business. Therefore, the way for managers to make their com-
panies more valuable is to increase free cash flow now and in the future.
Notice that FCF is the cash flow available for distribution to all the company’s investors
after the company has made all investments necessary to sustain ongoing operations. How well
have MicroDrive’s managers done in generating FCF? In this section, we will calculate
MicroDrive’s FCF and evaluate the performance of MicroDrive’s managers.
Figure 2-1 shows the five steps in calculating free cash flow. As we explain each individ-
ual step in the following sections, refer back to Figure 2-1 to keep the big picture in mind.
Net Operating Profit after Taxes (NOPAT)
If two companies have different amounts of debt and hence different amounts of in-
terest charges, they could have identical operating performances but different net
incomes—the one with more debt would have a lower net income. Net income is
certainly important, but it does not always reflect the true performance of a com-
pany’s operations or the effectiveness of its operating managers. A better measure-
ment for comparing managers’ performance is net operating profit after taxes, or
NOPAT, which is the amount of profit a company would generate if it had no debt
and held no financial assets. NOPAT is defined as follows:10
9For a more detailed discussion of financial statement analysis, see Lyn M. Fraser and Aileen Ormiston,
Understanding Financial Statements, 9th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 2010).
10For firms with a more complicated tax situation, it is better to define NOPAT as follows: NOPAT =
(Net income before preferred dividends) + (Net interest expense)(1 −Tax rate). Also, if firms are able to
defer paying some of their taxes, perhaps by the use of accelerated depreciation, then NOPAT should be
adjusted to reflect the taxes that the company actually paid on its operating income. See P. Daves, M.
Ehrhardt, and R. Shrieves, Corporate Valuation: A Guide for Managers and Investors (Mason, OH: Thomson
South-Western, 2004) for a detailed explanation of these and other adjustments. Also see Tim Koller,
Marc Goedhart, and David Wessels, Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies (Hoboken,
NJ: Wiley, 2005), and G. Bennett Stewart, The Quest for Value (New York: Harper Collins, 1991).
Chapter 2: Financial Statements, Cash Flow, and Taxes
59

NOPAT ¼ EBITð1 −Tax rateÞ
(2-3)
Using data from the income statements of Table 2-2, MicroDrive’s 2010 NOPAT is
NOPAT ¼ $283:8ð1 −0:4Þ ¼ $283:8ð0:6Þ ¼ $170:3 million
This means MicroDrive generated an after-tax operating profit of $170.3 million,
a little better than its previous NOPAT of $263(0.6) = $157.8 million. However, the
income statements in Table 2-2 show that MicroDrive’s earnings per share actually
declined. This decrease in EPS was caused by an increase in interest expense, and not
by a decrease in operating profit.
Net Operating Working Capital
Most companies need some current assets to support their operating activities. For
example, all companies must carry some cash to “grease the wheels” of their opera-
tions. Companies continuously receive checks from customers and write checks to
suppliers, employees, and so on. Because inflows and outflows do not coincide per-
fectly, a company must keep some cash in its bank account. In other words, some
cash is required to conduct operations. The same is true for most other current as-
sets, such as inventory and accounts receivable, which are required for normal opera-
tions. The short-term assets normally used in a company’s operating activities are
called operating current assets.
Not all current assets are operating current assets. For example, holdings of
short-term securities generally result from investment decisions made by the

treasurer and not as a natural consequence of operating activities. Therefore,
short-term investments are nonoperating assets and normally are excluded when
calculating operating current assets.11 A useful rule of thumb is that if an asset pays
interest, it should not be classified as an operating asset.
Some current liabilities—especially accounts payable and accruals—arise in the normal
course of operations. Such short-term liabilities are called operating current liabilities.
Not all current liabilities are operating current liabilities. For example, consider the cur-
rent liability shown as notes payable to banks. The company could have raised an equiva-
lent amount as long-term debt or could have issued stock, so the choice to borrow from
the bank was a financing decision and not a consequence of operations. Again, the rule of
thumb is that if a liability charges interest, it is not an operating liability.
If you are ever uncertain about whether an item is an operating asset or operating lia-
bility, ask yourself whether the item is a natural consequence of operations or if it is a dis-
cretionary choice, such as a particular method of financing or an investment in a particular
financial asset. If it is discretionary, then the item is not an operating asset or liability.
Notice that each dollar of operating current liabilities is a dollar that the company
does not have to raise from investors in order to conduct its short-term operating
activities. Therefore, we define net operating working capital (NOWC) as operat-
ing current assets minus operating current liabilities. In other words, net operating
working capital is the working capital acquired with investor-supplied funds. Here is
the definition in equation form:
Net operating
working capital ¼ Operating current
assets
−Operating current
liabilities
(2-4)
We can apply these definitions to MicroDrive, using the balance sheet data given
in Table 2-1. Here is its net operating working capital at year-end 2010:
NOWC ¼ Operating current assets  Operating current liabilities
¼ ðCash þ Accounts receivable þ InventoriesÞ
−ðAccounts payable þ AccrualsÞ
¼ ð$10 þ $375 þ $615Þ −ð$60 þ $140Þ
¼ $800 million
For the previous year, net operating working capital was
NOWC ¼ ð$15 þ $315 þ $415Þ −ð$30 þ $130Þ
¼ $585 million
Total Net Operating Capital
In addition to working capital, most companies also use long-term assets to support
their operations. These include land, buildings, factories, equipment, and the like.
Total net operating capital is the sum of NOWC and operating long-term assets:
Total net operating capital ¼ NOWC þ operating long-term assets
(2-5)
11If the marketable securities are held as a substitute for cash and therefore reduce the cash requirements,
then they may be classified as part of operating working capital. Generally, though, large holdings of mar-
ketable securities are held as a reserve for some contingency or else as a temporary “parking place” for
funds prior to an acquisition, a major capital investment program, or the like.
Chapter 2: Financial Statements, Cash Flow, and Taxes
61

Because MicroDrive’s operating long-term assets consist only of net plant and
equipment, its total net operating capital at year-end 2010 was
Total net operating capital ¼ $800 þ $1;000
¼ $1;800 million
For the previous year, its total net operating capital was
Total net operating capital ¼ $585 þ $870
¼ $1;455 million
Notice that we have defined total net operating capital as the sum of net operating
working capital and operating long-term assets. In other words, our definition is in terms
of operating assets and liabilities. However, we can also calculate total net operating cap-
ital by adding up the funds provided by investors, such as notes payable, long-term
bonds, preferred stock, and common equity. For MicroDrive, the total capital provided
by investors at year-end 2009 was $60 + $580 + $40 + $840 = $1,520 million. Of this
amount, $65 million was tied up in short-term investments, which are not directly re-
lated to MicroDrive’s operations. Therefore, only $1,520 −$65 = $1,455 million of
investor-supplied capital was used in operations. Notice that this is exactly the same
value as calculated before. This shows that we can calculate total net operating capital
either from net operating working capital and operating long-term assets or from the
investor-supplied funds. We usually base our calculations on operating data because
this approach allows us to analyze a division, factory, or work center, whereas the ap-
proach based on investor-supplied capital is applicable only for the entire company.
The expression “total net operating capital” is a mouthful, so we often call it oper-
ating capital or even just capital. Also, unless we specifically say “investor-supplied
capital,” we are referring to total net operating capital.
Net Investment in Operating Capital
As calculated previously, MicroDrive had $1,455 million of total net operating capital
at the end of 2009 and $1,800 million at the end of 2010. Therefore, during 2010, it
made a net investment in operating capital of
Net investment in operating capital ¼ $1;800 −$1;455 ¼ $345 million
Most of this investment was made in net operating working capital, which rose
from $585 million to $800 million, or by $215 million. This 37% increase in net op-
erating working capital, in view of a sales increase of only 5% (from $2,850 to $3,000
million), should set off warning bells in your head: Why did MicroDrive tie up so
much additional cash in working capital? Is the company gearing up for a big in-
crease in sales, or are inventories not moving and receivables not being collected?
We will address these questions in detail in Chapter 3, when we cover ratio analysis.
Calculating Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is defined as
FCF ¼ NOPAT −Net investment in operating capital
(2-6)
MicroDrive’s free cash flow in 2010 was
FCF ¼ $170:3 −ð$1;800 −$1;455Þ
¼ $170:3 −$345
¼ −$174:7 million
62
Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

Although we prefer this approach to calculating FCF, sometimes the financial
press calculates FCF with a different approach. The results are the same either
way, but you should be aware of this alternative approach. The difference lies in
how depreciation is treated. To see this, notice that net fixed assets rose from
$870 to $1,000 million, or by $130 million. However, MicroDrive reported
$100 million of depreciation, so its gross investment in fixed assets was $130 +
$100 = $230 million for the year. With this background, the gross investment in
operating capital is
Gross investment
in operating capital ¼
Net investment
in operating capital þ Depreciation
(2-7)
For MicroDrive, the gross investment in operating capital was:
Gross investment
in operating capital ¼ $345 þ $100 ¼ $445 million
Financial Bamboozling: How to Spot It
Recent accounting frauds by Enron, WorldCom, Xerox,
Merck, Arthur Andersen, Tyco, and many others have
shown that analysts can no longer blindly assume that
a firm’s published financial statements are the best re-
presentation of its financial position. Clearly, many
companies were “pushing the envelope” if not outright
lying in an effort to make their companies look better.
A recent Fortune article points out that there are only
three basic ways to manipulate financial statements:
moving earnings from the future to the present, avoid-
ing taxes, or hiding debt. For example, suppose one tel-
ecom firm (think WorldCom or Global Crossing) sold
the right to use parts of its fiber-optic network for 10
years to another telecom firm for $100 million. The
seller would immediately record revenues of $100 mil-
lion. The buyer, however, could spread the expense
over 10 years and report an expense of only $10 million
this year. The buyer would simultaneously sell similar
rights to the original seller for $100 million. This way,
no cash changes hands, both companies report an ex-
tra $100 million in revenue, but each reports a cost of
only $10 million. Thus, both companies “created” an
extra $90 million in pre-tax profits without actually do-
ing anything. Of course, both companies will have to
report an extra $10 million expense each year for the
remaining 9 years, but they have each boosted short-
term profits and thus this year’s executive bonuses. To
boost earnings next year, all they have to do is play the
same game, but on a bigger scale.
For hiding debt, it’s hard to beat Enron’s special pur-
pose entities (SPEs). These SPEs owed hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars, and it turned out that Enron was
responsible for this debt, even though it never showed
up on Enron’s financial statements.
How can you spot bamboozling? Here are some tips.
When companies have lots of write-offs or charges for
restructuring, it could be that they are planning on man-
aging earnings in the future. In other words, they sand-
bag this year to pad next year’s earnings. Beware of
serial acquirers, especially if they use their own stock
to buy other companies. This can increase reported
earnings, but it often erodes value since the acquirer
usually pays a large premium for the target. Watch out
for companies that depreciate their assets much more
slowly than others in the industry (this is shown in the
financial statements’ footnotes). This causes their cur-
rent earnings to look larger than their competitors’,
even though they aren’t actually performing any better.
Perhaps the best evidence of bamboozling is if earnings
are consistently growing faster than cash flows, which
almost always indicates a financial scam.

Because depreciation is a noncash expense, some analysts calculate operating cash
flow as
Operating cash flow ¼ NOPAT þ Depreciation
(2-8)
MicroDrive’s most recent operating cash flow is
Operating cash flow ¼ NOPAT þ Depreciation ¼ $170:3 þ $100 ¼ $270:3

For MicroDrive, this definition produces FCF of −$174.7, the same value as found
earlier:
FCF ¼ ð$170:3 þ $100Þ −$445
¼ −$174:7 million
Equations 2-6 and 2-9 are equivalent because depreciation is added to both NOPAT
and net investment in Equation 2-6 to arrive at Equation 2-9. We usually use
Equation 2-6, because it saves us this step, but you should be aware of this alterna-
tive approach.
The Uses of FCF
Recall that free cash flow (FCF) is the amount of cash that is available for distribu-
tion to all investors, including shareholders and debtholders. There are five good
uses for FCF:
1. Pay interest to debtholders, keeping in mind that the net cost to the company
is the after-tax interest expense.
2. Repay debtholders; that is, pay off some of the debt.
3. Pay dividends to shareholders.
4. Repurchase stock from shareholders.
5. Buy short-term investments or other nonoperating assets.
Consider MicroDrive, with its FCF of −$174.7 million in 2010. How did MicroDrive
use the FCF?
MicroDrive’s income statement shows an interest expense of $88 million. With a
tax rate of 40%, the after-tax interest payment for the year is
After-tax interest payment ¼ $88ð1 −40%Þ ¼ $52:8 million
The net amount of debt that is repaid is equal to the amount at the beginning of the
year minus the amount at the end of the year. This includes notes payable and long-term
debt. If the amount of ending debt is less than the beginning debt, the company paid down
64
Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

some of its debt. But if the ending debt is greater than the beginning debt, the company
actually borrowed additional funds from creditors. In that case, it would be a negative use
of FCF. For MicroDrive, the net debt repayment for 2010 is
Net reduction in debt ¼ ð$60 þ $580Þ −ð$754 −$110Þ ¼ −$224 million
This is a “negative use” of FCF because it increased the debt balance. This is typical
of most companies because growing companies usually add debt each year.
MicroDrive paid $4 million in preferred dividends and $57.5 in common divi-
dends for a total of
Dividend payments ¼ $4 þ $57:5 ¼ $61:5 million
The net amount of stock that is repurchased is equal to the amount at the begin-
ning of the year minus the amount at the end of the year. This includes preferred
stock and common stock. If the amount of ending stock is less than the beginning
stock, then the company made net repurchases. But if the ending stock is greater
than the beginning stock, the company actually made net issuances. In that case, it
would be a negative use of FCF. Even though MicroDrive neither issued nor re-
purchased stock during the year, many companies use FCF to repurchase stocks as a
replacement for or supplement to dividends, as we discuss in Chapter 14.
The amount of net purchases of short-term investments is equal to the amount at
the end of the year minus the amount at the beginning of the year. If the amount of
ending investments is greater than the beginning investments, then the company
made net purchases. But if the ending investments are less than the beginning invest-
ments, the company actually sold investments. In that case, it would be a negative use
of FCF. MicroDrive’s net purchases of short-term investments in 2010 is:
Net purchases of short-term investments ¼ $0 −$65 ¼ −$65 million
Notice that this is a “negative use” because MicroDrive sold short-term investments
instead of purchasing them.
We combine these individual uses of FCF to find the total uses.
1. After-tax interest:
$ 52.8
2. Net debt repayments:
−224.0
3. Dividends:
61.5
4. Net stock repurchases:
0.0
5. Net purchases of ST investments:
−65.0
Total uses of FCF:
−$174.7
The −$174.7 total for uses of FCF is identical to the value of FCF from operations
that we calculated previously. If it were not equal, then we would have made an error
somewhere in our calculations.
Observe that a company does not use FCF to acquire operating assets, because the
calculation of FCF already takes into account the purchase of operating assets needed
to support growth. Unfortunately, there is evidence to suggest that some companies
with high FCF tend to make unnecessary investments that don’t add value, such as
paying too much to acquire another company. Thus, high FCF can cause waste if man-
agers fail to act in the best interests of shareholders. As discussed in Chapter 1, this is
called an agency cost, since managers are hired as agents to act on behalf of stock-
holders. We discuss agency costs and ways to control them in Chapter 13, where we
discuss value-based management and corporate governance, and in Chapter 15, where
we discuss the choice of capital structure.
Chapter 2: Financial Statements, Cash Flow, and Taxes

FCF and Corporate Value
Free cash flow is the amount of cash available for distribution to investors; so the
fundamental value of a company to its investors depends on the present value of its
expected future FCFs, discounted at the company’s weighted average cost of capital
(WACC). Subsequent chapters will develop the tools needed to forecast FCFs and
evaluate their risk. Chapter 13 ties all this together with a model that is used to cal-
culate the value of a company. Even though you do not yet have all the tools to apply
the model, it’s important that you understand this basic concept: FCF is the cash flow
available for distribution to investors. Therefore, the fundamental value of a firm primarily
depends on its expected future FCF.
Evaluating FCF, NOPAT, and Operating Capital
Even though MicroDrive had a positive NOPAT, its very high investment in operat-
ing assets resulted in a negative FCF. Because free cash flow is the cash flow available
for distribution to investors, MicroDrive’s negative FCF meant that MicroDrive had
to sell short-term investments and so investors actually had to provide additional
money to keep the business going.
Is a negative free cash flow always bad? The answer is, “Not necessarily; it depends
on why the free cash flow was negative.” It’s a bad sign if FCF was negative because
NOPAT was negative, since then the company is probably experiencing operating
problems. However, many high-growth companies have positive NOPAT but negative
FCF because they are making large investments in operating assets to support growth.
There is nothing wrong with profitable growth, even if it causes negative cash flows.
One way to determine whether growth is profitable is by examining the return on in-
vested capital (ROIC), which is the ratio of NOPAT to total operating capital. If the
ROIC exceeds the rate of return required by investors, then a negative free cash flow
caused by high growth is nothing to worry about. Chapter 13 discusses this in detail.
To calculate the ROIC, we first calculate NOPAT and operating capital. The re-
turn on invested capital is a performance measure that indicates how much NOPAT
is generated by each dollar of operating capital:
ROIC ¼
NOPAT
Operating capital
(2-10)
If ROIC is greater than the rate of return that investors require, which is the
weighted average cost of capital (WACC), then the firm is adding value.
As noted previously, a negative FCF is not necessarily bad, provided it is due to high,
profitable growth.12 For example, Qualcomm’s sales grew by 26% in 2008, which led to
large capital investments and a FCF of negative $4.6 billion. However, its ROIC was
about 29%, so the growth was profitable. At some point Qualcomm’s growth will slow
and will not require large capital investments. If Qualcomm maintains a high ROIC,
then its FCF will become positive and very large as growth slows.
MicroDrive had an ROIC in 2010 of 9.46% ($170.3/$1,800 = 0.0946). Is this en-
ough to cover its cost of capital? We’ll answer that question in the next section.
12If g is the growth rate in capital, then with a little (or a lot of!) algebra, free cash flow is
FCF ¼ Capital

ROIC 

This shows that when the growth rate gets almost as high as ROIC, then FCF will be negative.

2.8 MVA AND EVA
Neither traditional accounting data nor the modified data discussed in the preceding
section incorporates stock prices, even though the primary goal of management is to
maximize the firm’s stock price. Financial analysts have therefore developed two ad-
ditional performance measures, Market Value Added (MVA) and Economic Value
Added (EVA). These concepts are discussed in this section.13
Market Value Added (MVA)
The primary goal of most firms is to maximize shareholders’ wealth. This goal obvi-
ously benefits shareholders, but it also helps to ensure that scarce resources are allo-
cated efficiently, which benefits the economy. Shareholder wealth is maximized by
maximizing the difference between the market value of the firm’s stock and the
amount of equity capital that was supplied by shareholders. This difference is called
the Market Value Added (MVA):
MVA ¼ Market value of stock −Equity capital supplied by shareholders
¼ ðShares outstandingÞðStock priceÞ −Total common equity
(2-11)
To illustrate, consider Coca-Cola. In January 2009, its total market equity value was
$103.2 billion while its balance sheet showed that stockholders had put up only $23.7
billion. Thus, Coca-Cola’s MVA was $103.2 −$23.7 = $79.5 billion. This $79.5 billion
represents the difference between the money that Coca-Cola’s stockholders have in-
vested in the corporation since its founding—including indirect investment by retaining
earnings—and the cash they could get if they sold the business. The higher its MVA, the
better the job management is doing for the firm’s shareholders.
Sometimes MVA is defined as the total market value of the company minus the
total amount of investor-supplied capital:
MVA ¼ Total market value −Total investor-supplied capital
¼ ðMarket value of stock þ Market value of debtÞ
−Total investor-supplied capital
(2-11a)
13The concepts of EVA and MVA were developed by Joel Stern and Bennett Stewart, co-founders of the
consulting firm Stern Stewart & Company. Stern Stewart copyrighted the terms “EVA” and “MVA,” so
other consulting firms have given other names to these values. Still, EVA and MVA are the terms most
commonly used in practice.

Chapter 2: Financial Statements, Cash Flow, and Taxes
67

For most companies, the total amount of investor-supplied capital is the sum of eq-
uity, debt, and preferred stock. We can calculate the total amount of investor-
supplied capital directly from their reported values in the financial statements. The
total market value of a company is the sum of the market values of common equity,
debt, and preferred stock. It is easy to find the market value of equity, since stock
prices are readily available, but it is not always easy to find the market value of debt.
Hence, many analysts use the value of debt that is reported in the financial state-
ments, which is the debt’s book value, as an estimate of its market value.
For Coca-Cola, the total amount of reported debt was about $24.4 billion, and
Coca-Cola had no preferred stock. Using this as an estimate of the market value of
debt, Coke’s total market value was $103.2 + $24.4 = $127.6 billion. The total
amount of investor-supplied funds was $23.7 + $24.4 = $48.1 billion. Using these to-
tal values, the MVA was $127.6 −$48.1 = $79.5 billion. Note that this is the same
answer as when we used the previous definition of MVA. Both methods will give
the same result if the market value of debt is approximately equal to its book value.
Economic Value Added (EVA)
Whereas MVA measures the effects of managerial actions since the very inception of
a company, Economic Value Added (EVA) focuses on managerial effectiveness in a
given year. The basic EVA formula is:
EVA ¼ Net operating profit after taxes ðNOPATÞ
 After-tax dollar cost of capital used to support operations
¼ EBITð1  Tax rateÞ  ðTotal net operating capitalÞðWACCÞ
(2-12)
We can also calculate EVA in terms of ROIC:
EVA ¼ ðOperating capitalÞðROIC  WACCÞ
(2-13)
As this equation shows, a firm adds value—that is, has a positive EVA—if its ROIC is
greater than its WACC. If WACC exceeds ROIC, then new investments in operating
capital will reduce the firm’s value.
Economic Value Added is an estimate of a business’s true economic profit for the
year, and it differs sharply from accounting profit.14 EVA represents the residual in-
come that remains after the cost of all capital, including equity capital, has been de-
ducted, whereas accounting profit is determined without imposing a charge for
equity capital. As we discuss in Chapter 9, equity capital has a cost because share-
holders give up the opportunity to invest and earn returns elsewhere when they pro-
vide capital to the firm. This cost is an opportunity cost rather than an accounting cost,
but it is quite real nevertheless.
Note that when calculating EVA we do not add back depreciation. Although it is not
a cash expense, depreciation is a cost because worn-out assets must be replaced, and it is
therefore deducted when determining both net income and EVA. Our calculation of
14The most important reason EVA differs from accounting profit is that the cost of equity capital is de-
ducted when EVA is calculated. Other factors that could lead to differences include adjustments that
might be made to depreciation, to research and development costs, to inventory valuations, and so on.
These other adjustments also can affect the calculation of investor-supplied capital, which affects both
EVA and MVA. See Stewart, The Quest for Value, cited in footnote 10.
68
Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

EVA assumes that the true economic depreciation of the company’s fixed assets exactly
equals the depreciation used for accounting and tax purposes. If this were not the case,
adjustments would have to be made to obtain a more accurate measure of EVA.
Economic Value Added measures the extent to which the firm has increased
shareholder value. Therefore, if managers focus on EVA, this will help to ensure
that they operate in a manner that is consistent with maximizing shareholder wealth.
Note too that EVA can be determined for divisions as well as for the company as a
whole, so it provides a useful basis for determining managerial performance at all le-
vels. Consequently, EVA is being used by an increasing number of firms as the pri-
mary basis for determining managerial compensation.
Table 2-5 shows how MicroDrive’s MVA and EVA are calculated. The stock
price was $23 per share at year-end 2010, down from $26 per share the previous
year. Its WACC, which is the percentage after-tax cost of capital, was 10.8% in
2009 and 11.0% in 2010, and its tax rate was 40%. Other data in Table 2-5 were
given in the basic financial statements provided earlier in the chapter.
Note first that the lower stock price and the higher book value of equity (due to retain-
ing earnings during 2010) combined to reduce the MVA. The 2010 MVA is still positive,
but $460 −$254 = $206 million of stockholders’ value was lost during the year.
Economic Value Added for 2009 was just barely positive, and in 2010 it was nega-
tive. Operating income (NOPAT) rose, but EVA still declined, primarily because the
amount of capital rose more sharply than NOPAT—by about 26% versus 8%—and
the cost of this additional capital pulled EVA down.
Recall also that net income fell, but not nearly so dramatically as the decline in
EVA. Net income does not reflect the amount of equity capital employed, but EVA

does. Because of this omission, net income is not as useful as EVA for setting corpo-
rate goals and measuring managerial performance.
We will have more to say about both MVA and EVA later in the book, but we can
close this section with two observations. First, there is a relationship between MVA
and EVA, but it is not a direct one. If a company has a history of negative EVAs,
then its MVA will probably be negative; conversely, its MVA probably will be posi-
tive if the company has a history of positive EVAs. However, the stock price, which is
the key ingredient in the MVA calculation, depends more on expected future perfor-
mance than on historical performance. Therefore, a company with a history of nega-
tive EVAs could have a positive MVA, provided investors expect a turnaround in the
future.
The second observation is that when EVAs or MVAs are used to evaluate mana-
gerial performance as part of an incentive compensation program, EVA is the mea-
sure that is typically used. The reasons are: (1) EVA shows the value added during a
given year, whereas MVA reflects performance over the company’s entire life, per-
haps even including times before the current managers were born; and (2) EVA can
be applied to individual divisions or other units of a large corporation, whereas MVA
must be applied to the entire corporation.

Define “Market Value Added (MVA)” and “Economic Value Added (EVA).”
How does EVA differ from accounting profit?

Sarbanes-Oxley and Financial Fraud
Investors need to be cautious when they review finan-
cial statements. Although companies are required to
follow
generally
accepted
accounting
principles
(GAAP), managers still have quite a lot of discretion in
deciding how and when to report certain transactions.
Consequently, two firms in exactly the same operating
situation may report financial statements that convey
different impressions about their financial strength.
Some variations may stem from legitimate differences
of opinion about the correct way to record transactions.
In other cases, managers may choose to report num-
bers in a way that helps them present either higher
earnings or more stable earnings over time. As long
as they follow GAAP, such actions are not illegal, but
these differences make it harder for investors to com-
pare companies and gauge their true performances.
Unfortunately, there have also been cases where
managers overstepped the bounds and reported fraud-
ulent statements. Indeed, a number of high-profile ex-
ecutives have faced criminal charges because of their
misleading accounting practices. For example, in June
2002 it was discovered that WorldCom (now called MCI)
had committed the most massive accounting fraud of
all time by recording over $7 billion of ordinary operat-
ing costs as capital expenditures, thus overstating net
income by the same amount.
WorldCom’s published financial statements fooled
most investors—investors bid the stock price up to
$64.50, and banks and other lenders provided the com-
pany with more than $30 billion of loans. Arthur Ander-
sen, the firm’s auditor, was faulted for not detecting the
fraud. WorldCom’s CFO and CEO were convicted, and
Arthur Andersen went bankrupt. But that didn’t help
the investors who relied on the published financial
statements.
In response to these and other abuses, Congress
passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. One of its provi-
sions requires both the CEO and the CFO to sign a state-
ment
certifying
that
the
“financial
statements
and
disclosures fairly represent, in all material respects, the
operations and financial condition” of the company.
This will make it easier to haul off in handcuffs a CEO or
CFO who has been misleading investors. Whether this
will prevent future financial fraud remains to be seen.

2.9 THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX SYSTEM
The value of any financial asset (including stocks, bonds, and mortgages), as well as
most real assets such as plants or even entire firms, depends on the after-tax stream of
cash flows produced by the asset. The following sections describe the key features of
corporate and individual taxation.
Corporate Income Taxes
The corporate tax structure, shown in Table 2-6, is relatively simple. The marginal
tax rate is the rate paid on the last dollar of income, while the average tax rate is
the average rate paid on all income. To illustrate, if a firm had $65,000 of taxable
income, its tax bill would be
Taxes ¼ $7;500 þ 0:25ð$65;000 −$50;000Þ
¼ $7;500 þ $3;750 ¼ $11;250
Its marginal rate would be 25%, and its average tax rate would be $11,250/$65,000 =
17.3%. Note that corporate income above $18,333,333 has an average and marginal
tax rate of 35%.15

15Prior to 1987, many large, profitable corporations such as General Electric and Boeing paid no income
taxes. The reasons for this were as follows: (1) expenses, especially depreciation, were defined differently
for calculating taxable income than for reporting earnings to stockholders, so some companies reported
positive profits to stockholders but losses—hence no taxes—to the Internal Revenue Service; and (2)
some companies that did have tax liabilities used various tax credits to offset taxes that would otherwise
have been payable. This situation was effectively eliminated in 1987.
The principal method used to eliminate this situation is the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Under
the AMT, both corporate and individual taxpayers must figure their taxes in two ways, the “regular” way
and the AMT way, and then pay the higher of the two. The AMT is calculated as follows: (1) Figure your
regular taxes. (2) Take your taxable income under the regular method and then add back certain items, es-
pecially income on certain municipal bonds, depreciation in excess of straight-line depreciation, certain
research and drilling costs, itemized or standard deductions (for individuals), and a number of other items.
(3) The income determined in (2) is defined as AMT income, and it must then be multiplied by the AMT
tax rate to determine the tax due under the AMT system. An individual or corporation must then pay the
higher of the regular tax or the AMT tax. In 2008, there were two AMT tax rates for individuals (26%
and 28%, depending on the level of AMT income and filing status). Most corporations have an AMT of
20%. However, there is no AMT for very small companies, defined as those that have had average sales of
less than $7.5 million for the past 3 years.

Interest and Dividend Income Received by a Corporation.
Interest income
received by a corporation is taxed as ordinary income at regular corporate tax
rates. However, 70% of the dividends received by one corporation from another is ex-
cluded from taxable income, while the remaining 30% is taxed at the ordinary tax
rate.16 Thus, a corporation earning more than $18,333,333 and paying a 35%
marginal tax rate would pay only (0.30)(0.35) = 0.105 = 10.5% of its dividend in-
come as taxes, so its effective tax rate on dividends received would be 10.5%. If
this firm had $10,000 in pre-tax dividend income, then its after-tax dividend in-
come would be $8,950:
After-tax income ¼ Before-tax income −Taxes
¼ Before-tax income −ðBefore-tax incomeÞ ðEffective tax rateÞ
¼ Before-tax income ð1 −Effective tax rateÞ
¼ $10;000½1 −ð0:30Þð0:35Þ
¼ $10;000ð1 −0:105Þ ¼ $10;000ð0:895Þ ¼ $8;950:
If the corporation pays its own after-tax income out to its stockholders as
dividends, then the income is ultimately subjected to triple taxation: (1) the orig-
inal corporation is first taxed, (2) the second corporation is then taxed on the
dividends it received, and (3) the individuals who receive the final dividends
are taxed again. This is the reason for the 70% exclusion on intercorporate
dividends.
If a corporation has surplus funds that can be invested in marketable securities, the
tax treatment favors investment in stocks, which pay dividends, rather than in bonds,
which pay interest. For example, suppose GE had $100,000 to invest, and suppose it
could buy either bonds that paid interest of $8,000 per year or preferred stock that
paid dividends of $7,000. GE is in the 35% tax bracket; therefore, its tax on the in-
terest, if it bought bonds, would be 0.35($8,000) = $2,800, and its after-tax income
would be $5,200. If it bought preferred (or common) stock, its tax would be
0.35[(0.30)($7,000)] = $735, and its after-tax income would be $6,265. Other factors
might lead GE to invest in bonds, but the tax treatment certainly favors stock invest-
ments when the investor is a corporation.17
Interest and Dividends Paid by a Corporation.
A firm’s operations can be fi-
nanced with either debt or equity capital. If the firm uses debt then it must pay inter-
est on this debt, but if the firm uses equity then it is expected to pay dividends to the
equity investors (stockholders). The interest paid by a corporation is deducted from
its operating income to obtain its taxable income, but dividends paid are not deduct-
ible. Therefore, a firm needs $1 of pre-tax income to pay $1 of interest, but if it is in
16The size of the dividend exclusion actually depends on the degree of ownership. Corporations that own
less than 20% of the stock of the dividend-paying company can exclude 70% of the dividends received;
firms that own more than 20% but less than 80% can exclude 80% of the dividends; and firms that own
more than 80% can exclude the entire dividend payment. We will, in general, assume a 70% dividend
exclusion.

17This illustration demonstrates why corporations favor investing in lower-yielding preferred stocks
over higher-yielding bonds. When tax consequences are considered, the yield on the preferred stock,
[1 −0.35(0.30)](7.0%) = 6.265%, is higher than the yield on the bond, (1 −0.35)(8.0%) = 5.2%. Also,
note that corporations are restricted in their use of borrowed funds to purchase other firms’ preferred or
common stocks. Without such restrictions, firms could engage in tax arbitrage, whereby the interest on
borrowed funds reduces taxable income on a dollar-for-dollar basis while taxable income is increased by
only $0.30 per dollar of dividend income. Thus, current tax laws reduce the 70% dividend exclusion in
proportion to the amount of borrowed funds used to purchase the stock.

the 40% federal-plus-state tax bracket, it must earn $1.67 of pre-tax income to pay $1
of dividends:
Pre-tax income needed
to pay $1 of dividends ¼
$1
1 −Tax rate ¼

0:60 ¼ $1:67
Working backward, if a company has $1.67 in pre-tax income, it must pay $0.67 in
taxes: (0.4)($1.67) = $0.67. This leaves the firm with after-tax income of $1.00.
Of course, it is generally not possible to finance exclusively with debt capital, and
the risk of doing so would offset the benefits of the higher expected income. Still, the
fact that interest is a deductible expense has a profound effect on the way businesses are fi-
nanced: Our corporate tax system favors debt financing over equity financing. This point
is discussed in more detail in Chapters 9 and 15.
Corporate Capital Gains.
Before 1987, corporate long-term capital gains were
taxed at lower rates than corporate ordinary income, so the situation was similar for
corporations and individuals. Under current law, however, corporations’ capital gains
are taxed at the same rates as their operating income.
Corporate Loss Carryback and Carryforward.
Ordinary corporate operating
losses can be carried back (carryback) to each of the preceding 2 years and forward
(carryforward) for the next 20 years and thus be used to offset taxable income in those
years. For example, an operating loss in 2010 could be carried back and used to reduce
taxable income in 2008 and 2009 as well as forward, if necessary, to reduce taxes in 2011,
2012, and so on, to the year 2030. After carrying back 2 years, any remaining loss is typ-
ically carried forward first to the next year, then to the one after that, and so on, until
losses have been used up or the 20-year carryforward limit has been reached.
To illustrate, suppose Apex Corporation had $2 million of pre-tax profits (taxable
income) in 2008 and 2009, and then, in 2010, Apex lost $12 million. Also, assume
that Apex’s federal-plus-state tax rate is 40%. As shown in Table 2-7, the company
would use the carryback feature to recompute its taxes for 2008, using $2 million of
the 2010 operating losses to reduce the 2008 pre-tax profit to zero. This would permit
it to recover the taxes paid in 2008. Therefore, in 2010 Apex would receive a refund of
its 2008 taxes because of the loss experienced in 2010. Because $10 million of the

unrecovered losses would still be available, Apex would repeat this procedure for 2009.
Thus, in 2010 the company would pay zero taxes for 2010 and also would receive a
refund for taxes paid in 2008 and 2009. Apex would still have $8 million of unrecov-
ered losses to carry forward, subject to the 20-year limit. This $8 million could be used
to offset future taxable income. The purpose of this loss treatment is to avoid penaliz-
ing corporations whose incomes fluctuate substantially from year to year.
Improper Accumulation to Avoid Payment of Dividends.
Corporations could
refrain from paying dividends and thus permit their stockholders to avoid personal
income taxes on dividends. To prevent this, the Tax Code contains an improper ac-
cumulation provision that states that earnings accumulated by a corporation are sub-
ject to penalty rates if the purpose of the accumulation is to enable stockholders to avoid
personal income taxes. A cumulative total of $250,000 (the balance sheet item “retained
earnings”) is by law exempted from the improper accumulation tax for most corpora-
tions. This is a benefit primarily to small corporations.
The improper accumulation penalty applies only if the retained earnings in excess
of $250,000 are shown by the IRS to be unnecessary to meet the reasonable needs of the busi-
ness. A great many companies do indeed have legitimate reasons for retaining more
than $250,000 of earnings. For example, earnings may be retained and used to pay
off debt, to finance growth, or to provide the corporation with a cushion against pos-
sible cash drains caused by losses. How much a firm should be allowed to accumulate
for uncertain contingencies is a matter of judgment. We shall consider this matter
again in Chapter 14, which deals with corporate dividend policy.
Consolidated Corporate Tax Returns.
If a corporation owns 80% or more of an-
other corporation’s stock, then it can aggregate income and file one consolidated tax re-
turn; thus, the losses of one company can be used to offset the profits of another.
(Similarly, one division’s losses can be used to offset another division’s profits.) No busi-
ness ever wants to incur losses (you can go broke losing $1 to save 35¢ in taxes), but tax
offsets do help make it more feasible for large, multidivisional corporations to undertake
risky new ventures or ventures that will suffer losses during a developmental period.
Taxes on Overseas Income.
Many U.S. corporations have overseas subsidiaries,
and those subsidiaries must pay taxes in the countries where they operate. Often, foreign
tax rates are lower than U.S. rates. As long as foreign earnings are reinvested overseas,
no U.S. tax is due on those earnings. However, when foreign earnings are repatriated to
the U.S. parent, they are taxed at the applicable U.S. rate, less a credit for taxes paid to
the foreign country. As a result, U.S. corporations such as IBM, Coca-Cola, and Micro-
soft have been able to defer billions of dollars of taxes. This procedure has stimulated
overseas investments by U.S. multinational firms—they can continue the deferral indef-
initely, but only if they reinvest the earnings in their overseas operations.18
Taxation of Small Businesses: S Corporations
The Tax Code provides that small businesses that meet certain restrictions may be set up
as corporations and thus receive the benefits of the corporate form of organization—
especially limited liability—yet still be taxed as proprietorships or partnerships rather
resource
See Ch02 Tool Kit.xls for
details.
18This is a contentious political issue. U.S. corporations argue that our tax system is similar to systems in
the rest of the world, and if they were taxed immediately on all overseas earnings then they would be at a
competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis their global competitors. Others argue that taxation encourages overseas
investments at the expense of domestic investments, contributing to the jobs outsourcing problem and
also to the federal budget deficit.
74
Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

than as corporations. These corporations are called S corporations. (“Regular” corpora-
tions are called C corporations.) If a corporation elects S corporation status for tax pur-
poses, then all of the business’s income is reported as personal income by its
stockholders, on a pro rata basis, and thus is taxed at the rates that apply to individuals.
This is an important benefit to the owners of small corporations in which all or most of
the income earned each year will be distributed as dividends, because then the income is
taxed only once, at the individual level.
Personal Taxes
Web Extension 2A provides a more detailed treatment of individual taxation, but the
key elements are presented here. Ordinary income consists primarily of wages or
profits from a proprietorship or partnership, plus investment income. For the 2009
tax year, individuals with less than $8,350 of taxable income are subject to a federal
income tax rate of 10%. For those with higher income, tax rates increase and go up
to 35%, depending on the level of income. This is called a progressive tax, because
the higher one’s income, the larger the percentage paid in taxes.
As noted before, individuals are taxed on investment income as well as earned in-
come, but with a few exceptions and modifications. For example, interest received
from most state and local government bonds, called municipals or “munis,” is not
subject to federal taxation. However, interest earned on most other bonds or lending
is taxed as ordinary income. This means that a lower-yielding muni can provide the
same after-tax return as a higher-yielding corporate bond. For a taxpayer in the 35%
marginal tax bracket, a muni yielding 5.5% provides the same after-tax return as a
corporate bond with a pre-tax yield of 8.46%: 8.46%(1 −0.35) = 5.5%.
Assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate are defined as capital assets. If you
own a capital asset and its price goes up, then your wealth increases, but you are
not liable for any taxes on your increased wealth until you sell the asset. If you
sell the asset for more than you originally paid, the profit is called a capital gain;
if you sell it for less, then you suffer a capital loss. The length of time you owned
the asset determines the tax treatment. If held for less than one year, then your
gain or loss is simply added to your other ordinary income. If held for more than
a year, then gains are called long-term capital gains and are taxed at a lower rate. See
Web Extension 2A for details, but the long-term capital gains rate is 15% for most
situations.
Under the 2003 tax law changes, dividends are now taxed as though they were
capital gains. As stated earlier, corporations may deduct interest payments but not di-
vidends when computing their corporate tax liability, which means that dividends are
taxed twice, once at the corporate level and again at the personal level. This differen-
tial treatment motivates corporations to use debt relatively heavily and to pay small
(or even no) dividends. The 2003 tax law did not eliminate the differential treatment
of dividends and interest payments from the corporate perspective, but it did make
the tax treatment of dividends more similar to that of capital gains from investors’
perspectives. To see this, consider a company that doesn’t pay a dividend but instead
reinvests the cash it could have paid. The company’s stock price should increase,
leading to a capital gain, which would be taxed at the same rate as the dividend. Of
course, the stock price appreciation isn’t actually taxed until the stock is sold, whereas
the dividend is taxed in the year it is paid, so dividends will still be more costly than
capital gains for many investors.
Finally, note that the income of S corporations and noncorporate businesses is re-
ported as income by the firms’ owners. Since there are far more S corporations,

Summary
The primary purposes of this chapter were (1) to describe the basic financial statements,
(2) to present some background information on cash flows, and (3) to provide an over-
view of the federal income tax system. The key concepts covered are listed below.
•
The four basic statements contained in the annual report are the balance sheet,
the income statement, the statement of stockholders’ equity, and the statement of
cash flows.
•
The balance sheet shows assets on the left-hand side and liabilities and equity,
or claims against assets, on the right-hand side. (Sometimes assets are shown at
the top and claims at the bottom of the balance sheet.) The balance sheet may
be thought of as a snapshot of the firm’s financial position at a particular point
in time.
•
The income statement reports the results of operations over a period of time,
and it shows earnings per share as its “bottom line.”
•
The statement of stockholders’ equity shows the change in retained earnings
between balance sheet dates. Retained earnings represent a claim against assets,
not assets per se.
•
The statement of cash flows reports the effect of operating, investing, and fi-
nancing activities on cash flows over an accounting period.
•
Net cash flow differs from accounting profit because some of the revenues and
expenses reflected in accounting profits may not have been received or paid out
in cash during the year. Depreciation is typically the largest noncash item, so net
cash flow is often expressed as net income plus depreciation.
•
Operating current assets are the current assets that are used to support opera-
tions, such as cash, inventory, and accounts receivable. They do not include
short-term investments.
•
Operating current liabilities are the current liabilities that occur as a natural
consequence of operations, such as accounts payable and accruals. They do not
include notes payable or any other short-term debts that charge interest.
•
Net operating working capital is the difference between operating current as-
sets and operating current liabilities. Thus, it is the working capital acquired with
investor-supplied funds.
•
Operating long-term assets are the long-term assets used to support opera-
tions, such as net plant and equipment. They do not include any long-term in-
vestments that pay interest or dividends.
76
Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

•
Total net operating capital (which means the same as operating capital and
net operating assets) is the sum of net operating working capital and operating
long-term assets. It is the total amount of capital needed to run the business.
•
NOPAT is net operating profit after taxes. It is the after-tax profit a company
would have if it had no debt and no investments in nonoperating assets. Because
it excludes the effects of financial decisions, it is a better measure of operating
performance than is net income.
•
Free cash flow (FCF) is the amount of cash flow remaining after a company
makes the asset investments necessary to support operations. In other words,
FCF is the amount of cash flow available for distribution to investors, so the value
of a company is directly related to its ability to generate free cash flow. FCF is defined
as NOPAT minus the net investment in operating capital.
•
Market Value Added (MVA) represents the difference between the total mar-
ket value of a firm and the total amount of investor-supplied capital. If the mar-
ket values of debt and preferred stock equal their values as reported on the
financial statements, then MVA is the difference between the market value of a
firm’s stock and the amount of equity its shareholders have supplied.
•
Economic Value Added (EVA) is the difference between after-tax operating
profit and the total dollar cost of capital, including the cost of equity capital.
EVA is an estimate of the value created by management during the year, and it
differs substantially from accounting profit because no charge for the use of eq-
uity capital is reflected in accounting profit.
•
Interest income received by a corporation is taxed as ordinary income; however,
70% of the dividends received by one corporation from another are excluded
from taxable income.
•
Because interest paid by a corporation is a deductible expense whereas divi-
dends are not, our tax system favors debt over equity financing.
•
Ordinary corporate operating losses can be carried back to each of the preced-
ing 2 years and carried forward for the next 20 years in order to offset taxable
income in those years.
•
S corporations are small businesses that have the limited-liability benefits of the
corporate form of organization yet are taxed as partnerships or proprietorships.
•
In the United States, tax rates are progressive—the higher one’s income, the
larger the percentage paid in taxes.
•
Assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate are defined as capital assets. If a
capital asset is sold for more than its cost, the profit is called a capital gain; if the
asset is sold for a loss, it is called a capital loss. Assets held for more than a year
provide long-term gains or losses.
•
Dividends are taxed as though they were capital gains.
•
Personal taxes are discussed in more detail in Web Extension 2A.

Mini Case
Donna Jamison, a graduate of the University of Tennessee with four years of banking experi-
ence, was recently brought in as assistant to the chairman of the board of Computron Indus-
tries, a manufacturer of electronic calculators.
The company doubled its plant capacity, opened new sales offices outside its home terri-
tory, and launched an expensive advertising campaign. Computron’s results were not satisfac-
tory, to put it mildly. Its board of directors, which consisted of its president and vice-president
plus its major stockholders (who were all local businesspeople), was most upset when directors
learned how the expansion was going. Suppliers were being paid late and were unhappy, and
the bank was complaining about the deteriorating situation and threatening to cut off credit.
As a result, Al Watkins, Computron’s president, was informed that changes would have to be
made—and quickly—or he would be fired. At the board’s insistence, Donna Jamison was given
the job of assistant to Fred Campo, a retired banker who was Computron’s chairman and larg-
est stockholder. Campo agreed to give up a few of his golfing days and to help nurse the com-
pany back to health, with Jamison’s assistance.
Jamison began by gathering financial statements and other data.

Assume that you are Jamison’s assistant and that you must help her answer the following
questions for Campo.
a. What effect did the expansion have on sales and net income? What effect did the ex-
pansion have on the asset side of the balance sheet? What effect did it have on liabilities
and equity?
b. What do you conclude from the statement of cash flows?
c. What is free cash flow? Why is it important? What are the five uses of FCF?
d. What is Computron’s net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT)? What are operating
current assets? What are operating current liabilities? How much net operating working
capital and total net operating capital does Computron have?
e. What is Computron’s free cash flow (FCF)? What are Computron’s “net uses” of its
FCF?
f. Calculate Computron’s return on invested capital. Computron has a 10% cost of capital
(WACC). Do you think Computron’s growth added value?
g. Jamison also has asked you to estimate Computron’s EVA. She estimates that the after-
tax cost of capital was 10% in both years.
h. What happened to Computron’s Market Value Added (MVA)?
i. Assume that a corporation has $100,000 of taxable income from operations plus $5,000
of interest income and $10,000 of dividend income. What is the company’s federal tax
liability?
j. Assume that you are in the 25% marginal tax bracket and that you have $5,000 to in-
vest. You have narrowed your investment choices down to California bonds with a yield
of 7% or equally risky ExxonMobil bonds with a yield of 10%. Which one should you
choose and why? At what marginal tax rate would you be indifferent to the choice be-
tween California and ExxonMobil bonds?

Analysis of Financial

o guide or not to guide, that is the question. Or at least it’s the question
many companies are wrestling with regarding earnings forecasts.
Should a company provide earnings estimates to investors? In 2006,
Best Buy answered this question by announcing that it would no longer
provide quarterly earnings forecasts. It’s no coincidence that Best Buy’s
decision came shortly after its actual earnings came in just 2 cents below
the forecast, yet its stock price fell by 12%. Coca-Cola, Motorola, and
Citigroup are among the growing number of companies that no longer
provide quarterly earnings forecasts.
Virtually no one disputes that investors need as much information as
possible to accurately evaluate a company, and academic studies show
that companies with greater transparency have higher valuations. However,
greater disclosure often brings the possibility of lawsuits if investors have
reason to believe that the disclosure is fraudulent. Although the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 helped prevent “frivolous”
lawsuits, many companies still chose not to provide information directly to
all investors. Instead, before 2000, many companies provided earnings
information to brokerage firms’ analysts, and the analysts then forecast
their own earnings expectations. In 2000 the SEC adopted Reg FD
(Regulation Fair Disclosure), which prevented companies from disclosing
information only to select groups, such as analysts. Reg FD led many
companies to begin providing quarterly earnings forecasts directly to the
public, and a survey by the National Investors Relations Institute showed
that 95% of respondents in 2006 provided either annual or quarterly
earnings forecasts, up from 45% in 1999.
Two trends are now in evidence. First, the number of companies reporting
quarterly earnings forecasts is falling, but the number reporting annual
forecasts is increasing. Second, many companies are providing other types of
forward-looking information, including key operating ratios plus qualitative
information about the company and its industry. Ratio analysis can help
investors use such information, so keep that in mind as you read this chapter.

Financial statement analysis involves (1) comparing a firm’s performance with that of
other firms in the same industry and (2) evaluating trends in the firm’s financial posi-
tion over time. Managers use financial analysis to identify situations needing atten-
tion; potential lenders use financial analysis to determine whether a company is
creditworthy; and stockholders use financial analysis to help predict future earnings,
dividends, and free cash flow. As we explain in this chapter, there are similarities and
differences among these uses.1
3.1 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
When we perform a financial analysis, we conduct the following steps.
Gather Data
The first step in financial analysis is to gather data. As we discussed in Chapter 2,
financial statements can be downloaded from many different Web sites. One of
our favorites is Zacks Investment Research, which provides financial statements in
Intrinsic Value and Analysis of Financial Statements
The intrinsic value of a firm is determined by the present
value of the expected future free cash flows (FCF)
when discounted at the weighted average cost of capital
(WACC). This chapter explains how to use financial state-
ments to evaluate a company’s profitability, required capi-
tal investments, business risk, and mix of debt and equity.

improved oversight of the accounting industry and increased the criminal penalties on management for
fraudulent reporting.

a standardized format. If you cut and paste financial statements from Zacks into a
spreadsheet and then perform a financial analysis, you can quickly repeat the analysis
on a different company by simply pasting that company’s financial statements into
the same cells as the original company’s statements. In other words, there is no
need to reinvent the wheel each time you analyze a company.
Examine the Statement of Cash Flows
Some financial analysis can be done with virtually no calculations. For example, we
always look to the statement of cash flows first, particularly the net cash provided
by operating activities. Downward trends or negative net cash flow from operations
almost always indicate problems. The statement of cash flows section on investing
activities shows whether the company has made a big acquisition, especially when
compared with the prior years’ net cash flows from investing activities. A quick look
at the section on financing activities also reveals whether or not a company is issuing
debt or buying back stock; in other words, is the company raising capital from inves-
tors or returning it to them?
Calculate and Examine the Return on Invested Capital
After examining the statement of cash flows, we calculate the return on invested cap-
ital (ROIC) as described in Chapter 2. The ROIC provides a vital measure of a firm’s
overall performance. If ROIC is greater than the company’s weighted average cost of
capital (WACC), then the company usually is adding value. If ROIC is less than
WACC, then the company usually has serious problems. No matter what ROIC tells
us about the firm’s overall performance, it is important to examine specific areas
within the firm, and for that we use ratios.
Begin Ratio Analysis
Financial ratios are designed to extract important information that might not be ob-
vious simply from examining a firm’s financial statements. For example, suppose
Firm A owes $5 million of debt while Firm B owes $50 million of debt. Which com-
pany is in a stronger financial position? It is impossible to answer this question with-
out first standardizing each firm’s debt relative to total assets, earnings, and interest.
Such standardized comparisons are provided through ratio analysis.
We will calculate the 2010 financial ratios for MicroDrive Inc., using data from the
balance sheets and income statements given in Table 3-1. We will also evaluate the
ratios in relation to the industry averages. Note that dollar amounts are in millions.
3.2 LIQUIDITY RATIOS
As shown in Table 3-1, MicroDrive has current liabilities of $310 million that must
be paid off within the coming year. Will it have trouble satisfying those obligations?
Liquidity ratios attempt to answer this type of question: We discuss two commonly
used liquidity ratios in this section.
The Current Ratio
The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities:
Current ratio ¼
Current assets
Current liabilities

expenses.

Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

MicroDrive has a lower current ratio than the average for its industry. Is this good or
bad? Sometimes the answer depends on who is asking the question. For example, sup-
pose a supplier is trying to decide whether to extend credit to MicroDrive. In general,
creditors like to see a high current ratio. If a company is getting into financial difficulty,
it will begin paying its bills (accounts payable) more slowly, borrowing from its bank,
and so on, so its current liabilities will be increasing. If current liabilities are rising faster
than current assets then the current ratio will fall, and this could spell trouble. Because
the current ratio provides the best single indicator of the extent to which the claims of
short-term creditors are covered by assets that are expected to be converted to cash fairly
quickly, it is the most commonly used measure of short-term solvency.
Now consider the current ratio from the perspective of a shareholder. A high cur-
rent ratio could mean that the company has a lot of money tied up in nonproductive
assets, such as excess cash or marketable securities. Or perhaps the high current ratio
is due to large inventory holdings, which might well become obsolete before they can
be sold. Thus, shareholders might not want a high current ratio.
An industry average is not a magic number that all firms should strive to maintain—in
fact, some very well-managed firms will be above the average, while other good firms will
be below it. However, if a firm’s ratios are far removed from the averages for its industry,
this is a red flag, and analysts should be concerned about why the variance occurs. For
example, suppose a low current ratio is traced to low inventories. Is this a competitive
advantage resulting from the firm’s mastery of just-in-time inventory management, or is
it an Achilles’ heel that is causing the firm to miss shipments and lose sales? Ratio analysis
doesn’t answer such questions, but it does point to areas of potential concern.
The Quick, or Acid Test, Ratio
The quick, or acid test, ratio is calculated by deducting inventories from current
assets and then dividing the remainder by current liabilities:
Quick; or acid test; ratio ¼ Current assets −Inventories
Current liabilities
¼ $385
$310 ¼ 1:2
Industry average ¼ 2:1
A liquid asset is one that trades in an active market and hence can be converted
quickly to cash at the going market price. Inventories are typically the least liquid of
a firm’s current assets; hence they are the current assets on which losses are most
likely to occur in a bankruptcy. Therefore, a measure of the firm’s ability to pay off
short-term obligations without relying on the sale of inventories is important.
The industry average quick ratio is 2.1, so MicroDrive’s 1.2 ratio is low in compari-
son with other firms in its industry. Still, if the accounts receivable can be collected, the
company can pay off its current liabilities without having to liquidate its inventory.
Self-Test
Identify two ratios that are used to analyze a firm’s liquidity position, and write out
their equations.
What are the characteristics of a liquid asset? Give some examples.
Which current asset is typically the least liquid?
A company has current liabilities of $800 million, and its current ratio is 2.5. What is
its level of current assets? ($2,000 million) If this firm’s quick ratio is 2, how much
inventory does it have? ($400 million)
Chapter 3: Analysis of Financial Statements
91

3.3 ASSET MANAGEMENT RATIOS
Asset management ratios measure how effectively a firm is managing its assets. If a
company has excessive investments in assets, then its operating capital will be unduly
high, which will reduce its free cash flow and ultimately its stock price. On the other
hand, if a company does not have enough assets then it will lose sales, which will hurt
profitability, free cash flow, and the stock price. Therefore, it is important to have
the right amount invested in assets. Ratios that analyze the different types of assets
are described in this section.
Evaluating Inventories: The Inventory Turnover Ratio
The inventory turnover ratio is defined as sales divided by inventories:
Inventory turnover ratio ¼
Sales
Inventories
¼ $3;000
$615
¼ 4:9
Industry average ¼ 9:0
As a rough approximation, each item of MicroDrive’s inventory is sold out and re-
stocked, or “turned over,” 4.9 times per year.2
MicroDrive’s turnover of 4.9 is much lower than the industry average of 9.0. This
suggests that MicroDrive is holding too much inventory. High levels of inventory
add to net operating working capital (NOWC), which reduces FCF, which leads to
lower stock prices. In addition, MicroDrive’s low inventory turnover ratio makes us
wonder whether the firm is actually holding obsolete goods not worth their stated
value.3
Note that sales occur over the entire year, whereas the inventory figure is mea-
sured at a single point in time. For this reason, it is better to use an average inventory
measure.4 If the firm’s business is highly seasonal, or if there has been a strong up-
ward or downward sales trend during the year, then it is especially useful to make
some such adjustment. To maintain comparability with industry averages, however,
we did not use the average inventory figure.
2“Turnover” is a term that originated many years ago with the old Yankee peddler who would load up his
wagon with goods and then go off to peddle his wares. If he made 10 trips per year, stocked 100 pans, and
made a gross profit of $5 per pan, his annual gross profit would be (100)($5)(10) = $5,000. If he “turned
over” (i.e., sold) his inventory faster and made 20 trips per year, then his gross profit would double, other
things held constant. So, his turnover directly affected his profits.
3A problem arises when calculating and analyzing the inventory turnover ratio. Sales are stated at market
prices, so if inventories are carried at cost, as they generally are, then the calculated turnover overstates
the true turnover ratio. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to use cost of goods sold in place of sales
in the formula’s numerator. However, established compilers of financial ratio statistics such as Dun &
Bradstreet use the ratio of sales to inventories carried at cost. To develop a figure that can be compared
with those published by Dun & Bradstreet and similar organizations, it is necessary to measure inventory
turnover with sales in the numerator, as we do here.
4Preferably, the average inventory value should be calculated by summing the monthly figures during the
year and dividing by 12. If monthly data are not available, one can add the beginning and ending annual
figures and divide by 2. However, most industry ratios are calculated as shown here, using end-of-year
values.

Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

Evaluating Receivables: The Days Sales Outstanding
Days sales outstanding (DSO), also called the “average collection period” (ACP), is
used to appraise accounts receivable, and it is calculated by dividing accounts receivable
by average daily sales to find the number of days’ sales that are tied up in receivables.5
Thus, the DSO represents the average length of time that the firm must wait after mak-
ing a sale before receiving cash, which is the average collection period. MicroDrive has
46 DSO, well above the 36-day industry average:
DSO ¼ Days sales
outstanding ¼
Receivables
Average sales per day ¼
Receivables
Annual sales=365
¼
$375
$3;000=365 ¼
$375
$8:2192 ¼ 45:6 days ≈46 days
Industry average ¼ 36 days
MicroDrive’s sales terms call for payment within 30 days. The fact that 46 days of
sales are outstanding indicates that customers, on average, are not paying their bills

ing? The answer to that question matters because an
accounting practice called “mark to market” requires
that some assets be adjusted on the balance sheet to
reflect their “fair market value.” The accounting rules
are complicated, but the general idea is that if an asset
is available for sale, then the balance sheet would be
most accurate if it showed the asset’s market value.
For example, suppose a company purchased $100 mil-
lion of Treasury bonds and the value of those bonds
later fell to $90 million. With mark to market, the com-
pany would report the bonds’ value on the balance
sheet as $90 million, not the original purchase price of
$100 million. Notice that marking to market can have a
significant impact on financial ratios and thus on inves-
tors’ perception of a firm’s financial health.
But what if the assets are mortgage-backed securi-
ties that were originally purchased for $100 million?
As defaults increased during 2008, the value of such se-
curities fell rapidly, and then investors virtually stopped
trading them. How should the company report them? At
the $100 million original price, at a $60 million price that
was observed before the market largely dried up, at $25
million when a hedge fund in desperate need for cash
to avoid a costly default sold a few of these securities,
or at $0, since there are no current quotes? Or should
they be reported at a price generated by a computer
model or in some other manner?
The answer to this question has vital implications for
the global financial crisis. In early 2009, Congress, the
SEC, FASB, and the U.S. Treasury all are working to
find the right answers. If they come up with a price
that is too low, it could cause investors mistakenly to
believe that some companies are worth much less
than their intrinsic values, and this could trigger runs
on banks and bankruptcies for companies that might
otherwise survive. But if the price is too high, some
“walking dead” or “zombie” companies could linger
on and later cause even larger losses for investors, in-
cluding the U.S. government, which is now the largest
investor in many financial institutions. Either way, an
error in pricing could perhaps trigger a domino effect
that might topple the entire financial system. So let’s
hope the price is right!

the industry average.

on time. As with inventory, high levels of accounts receivable cause high levels of
NOWC, which hurts FCF and stock price.
A customer who is paying late may well be in financial trouble, in which case
MicroDrive may have a hard time ever collecting the receivable. Therefore, if the trend
in DSO has been rising but the credit policy has not been changed, steps should be taken
to review credit standards and to expedite the collection of accounts receivable.
Evaluating Fixed Assets: The Fixed Assets Turnover Ratio
The fixed assets turnover ratio measures how effectively the firm uses its plant and
equipment. It is the ratio of sales to net fixed assets:
Fixed assets turnover ratio ¼
Sales
Net fixed assets
¼ $3;000
$1;000 ¼ 3:0
Industry average ¼ 3:0
MicroDrive’s ratio of 3.0 is equal to the industry average, indicating that the firm is using
its fixed assets about as intensively as are other firms in its industry. Therefore, Micro-
Drive seems to have about the right amount of fixed assets in relation to other firms.
A potential problem can exist when interpreting the fixed assets turnover ratio. Recall
from accounting that fixed assets reflect the historical costs of the assets. Inflation has
caused the current value of many assets that were purchased in the past to be seriously
understated. Therefore, if we were comparing an old firm that had acquired many of its
fixed assets years ago at low prices with a new company that had acquired its fixed
assets only recently, we would probably find that the old firm had the higher fixed assets
turnover ratio. However, this would be more reflective of the difficulty accountants
have in dealing with inflation than of any inefficiency on the part of the new firm. You
should be alert to this potential problem when evaluating the fixed assets turnover ratio.
Evaluating Total Assets: The Total Assets Turnover Ratio
The total assets turnover ratio is calculated by dividing sales by total assets:
Total assets turnover ratio ¼
Sales
Total assets
¼ $3;000
$2;000 ¼ 1:5
Industry average ¼ 1:8
MicroDrive’s ratio is somewhat below the industry average, indicating that the com-
pany is not generating a sufficient volume of business given its total asset investment.
Sales should be increased, some assets should be sold, or a combination of these steps
should be taken.

Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

3.4 DEBT MANAGEMENT RATIOS
The extent to which a firm uses debt financing, or financial leverage, has three im-
portant implications: (1) By raising funds through debt, stockholders can maintain
control of a firm without increasing their investment. (2) If the firm earns more on
investments financed with borrowed funds than it pays in interest, then its share-
holders’ returns are magnified, or “leveraged,” but their risks are also magnified. (3)
Creditors look to the equity, or owner-supplied funds, to provide a margin of safety,
so the higher the proportion of funding supplied by stockholders, the less risk cred-
itors face. Chapter 15 explains the first two points in detail, while the following ratios
examine leverage from a creditor’s point of view.
How the Firm is Financed: Total Liabilities to Total Assets
The ratio of total liabilities to total assets is called the debt ratio, or sometimes the
total debt ratio. It measures the percentage of funds provided by current liabilities
and long-term debt:
Debt ratio ¼ Total liabilities
Total assets
¼ $310 þ $754
$2;000
¼ $1;064
$2;000 ¼ 53:2%
Industry average ¼ 40:0%
Creditors prefer low debt ratios because the lower the ratio, the greater the cushion
against creditors’ losses in the event of liquidation. Stockholders, on the other hand,
may want more leverage because it magnifies their return, as we explain in Section
3.8 when we discuss the Du Pont model.
MicroDrive’s debt ratio is 53.2% but its debt ratio in the previous year was 47.6%,
which means that creditors are now supplying more than half the total financing. In
addition to an upward trend, the level of the debt ratio is well above the industry av-
erage. Creditors may be reluctant to lend the firm more money because a high debt
ratio is associated with a greater risk of bankruptcy.
Some sources report the debt-to-equity ratio, defined as:
Debt-to-equity ratio ¼
Total liabilities
Total assets −Total liabilities
¼
$310 þ $754
$2;000 −ð$310 þ $754Þ ¼ $1;064
$936 ¼ 1:14
Industry average ¼ 0:67
The debt-to-equity ratio and the debt ratio contain the same information but present
that information slightly differently.6 The debt-to-equity ratio shows that Micro-
Drive has $1.14 of debt for every dollar of equity, whereas the debt ratio shows that
53.2% of MicroDrive’s financing is in the form of liabilities. We find it more
6The debt ratio and debt-to-equity ratios are simply transformations of each other:

intuitive to think about the percentage of the firm that is financed with debt, so we
usually use the debt ratio. However, the debt-to-equity ratio is also widely used, so
you should know how to interpret it.
Sometimes it is useful to express debt ratios in terms of market values. It is easy to
calculate the market value of equity, which is equal to the stock price multiplied by
the number of shares. MicroDrive’s market value of equity is $23(50) = $1,150. Often
it is difficult to estimate the market value of liabilities, so many analysts define the
market debt ratio as
Market debt ratio ¼
Total liabilities
Total liabilities þ Market value of equity
¼
$1;064
$1;064 þ ð$23 × 50Þ ¼ $1;064
$2;214 ¼ 48:1%
MicroDrive’s market debt ratio in the previous year was 38.1%. The big increase
was due to two major factors: Liabilities increased and the stock price fell. The
stock price reflects a company’s prospects for generating future cash flows, so a de-
cline in stock price indicates a likely decline in future cash flows. Thus, the market
debt ratio reflects a source of risk that is not captured by the conventional book
debt ratio.
If you use a debt ratio that you did not calculate yourself, be sure to find out
how the ratio was defined. Some sources provide the ratio of long-term debt to total
assets, and some provide the ratio of all debt to equity, so be sure to check your
source’s definition.
Ability to Pay Interest: Times-Interest-Earned Ratio
The times-interest-earned (TIE) ratio, also called the interest coverage ratio, is
determined by dividing earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT in Table 3-1) by the
interest expense:
Times-interest-earned ðTIEÞ ratio ¼
EBIT
Interest expense
¼ $283:8
$88
¼ 3:2
Industry average ¼ 6:0
The TIE ratio measures the extent to which operating income can decline before
the firm is unable to meet its annual interest costs. Failure to meet this obligation can
bring legal action by the firm’s creditors, possibly resulting in bankruptcy. Note that
earnings before interest and taxes, rather than net income, is used in the numerator.
Because interest is paid with pre-tax dollars, the firm’s ability to pay current interest
is not affected by taxes.
MicroDrive’s interest is covered 3.2 times. The industry average is 6, so
MicroDrive is covering its interest charges by a relatively low margin of safety.
Thus, the TIE ratio reinforces the conclusion from our analysis of the debt
ratio that MicroDrive would face difficulties if it attempted to borrow additional
funds.
96
Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

Ability to Service Debt: EBITDA Coverage Ratio
The TIE ratio is useful for assessing a company’s ability to meet interest charges on its
debt, but this ratio has two shortcomings: (1) Interest is not the only fixed financial
charge—companies must also reduce debt on schedule, and many firms lease assets
and thus must make lease payments. If they fail to repay debt or meet lease payments,
they can be forced into bankruptcy. (2) EBIT does not represent all the cash flow avail-
able to service debt, especially if a firm has high depreciation and/or amortization
charges. The EBITDA coverage ratio accounts for these deficiencies:7
EBITDA coverage ratio ¼
EBITDA þ Lease payments
Interest þ Principal payments þ Lease payments
¼
$383:8 þ $28
$88 þ $20 þ $28 ¼ $411:8
$136
¼ 3:0
Industry average ¼ 4:3
MicroDrive had $383.8 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization (EBITDA). Also, lease payments of $28 million were deducted while
calculating EBITDA. That $28 million was available to meet financial charges; hence
it must be added back, bringing the total available to cover fixed financial charges to
$411.8 million. Fixed financial charges consisted of $88 million of interest, $20 mil-
lion of sinking fund payments, and $28 million for lease payments, for a total of $136
million.8 Therefore, MicroDrive covered its fixed financial charges by 3.0 times.
However, if EBITDA declines then the coverage will fall, and EBITDA certainly
can decline. Moreover, MicroDrive’s ratio is well below the industry average, so
again the company seems to have a relatively high level of debt.
The EBITDA coverage ratio is most useful for relatively short-term lenders such
as banks, which rarely make loans (except real estate-backed loans) for longer than
about 5 years. Over a relatively short period, depreciation-generated funds can be
used to service debt. Over a longer time, those funds must be reinvested to maintain
the plant and equipment or else the company cannot remain in business. Therefore,
banks and other relatively short-term lenders focus on the EBITDA coverage ratio,
whereas long-term bondholders focus on the TIE ratio.
Self-Test
How does the use of financial leverage affect current stockholders’ control position?
Explain the following statement: “Analysts look at both balance sheet and income
statement ratios when appraising a firm’s financial condition.”
Name three ratios that are used to measure the extent to which a firm uses financial
leverage, and write out their equations.
A company has EBITDA of $600 million, interest payments of $60 million, lease pay-
ments of $40 million, and required principal payments (due this year) of $30 million.
What is its EBITDA coverage ratio? (4.9)
7Different analysts define the EBITDA coverage ratio in different ways. For example: some omit the lease
payment information; others “gross up” principal payments by dividing them by 1 – T since these pay-
ments are not tax deductions and hence must be made with after-tax cash flows. We included lease pay-
ments because for many firms they are quite important, and failing to make them can lead to bankruptcy
just as surely as can failure to make payments on “regular” debt. We did not gross up principal payments
because, if a company is in financial difficulty, then its tax rate will probably be zero; hence the gross up is
not necessary whenever the ratio is really important.
8A sinking fund is a required annual payment designed to reduce the balance of a bond or preferred stock
issue.

3.5 PROFITABILITY RATIOS
Profitability is the net result of a number of policies and decisions. The ratios exam-
ined thus far provide useful clues as to the effectiveness of a firm’s operations, but the
profitability ratios go on to show the combined effects of liquidity, asset manage-
ment, and debt on operating results.
Net Profit Margin
The net profit margin, which is also called the profit margin on sales, is calculated
by dividing net income by sales. It gives the profit per dollar of sales:
Net profit margin ¼
Net income available to
common stockholders
Sales
¼ $113:5
$3;000 ¼ 3:8%
Industry average ¼ 5:0%
MicroDrive’s net profit margin is below the industry average of 5%, but why is this
so? Is it due to inefficient operations, high interest expenses, or both?
Instead of just comparing net income to sales, many analysts also break the income
statement into smaller parts to identify the sources of a low net profit margin. For
example, the operating profit margin is defined as
Operating profit margin ¼ EBIT
Sales
The operating profit margin identifies how a company is performing with respect to
its operations before the impact of interest expenses is considered. Some analysts drill
even deeper by breaking operating costs into their components. For example, the
gross profit margin is defined as
Gross profit margin ¼ Sales −Cost of goods sold
Sales
The gross profit margin identifies the gross profit per dollar of sales before any other
expenses are deducted.
Rather than calculate each type of profit margin here, later in the chapter we will
use common size analysis and percent change analysis to focus on different parts of
the income statement. In addition, we will use the Du Pont equation to show how
the ratios interact with one another.
Sometimes it is confusing to have so many different types of profit margins. To
help simplify the situation, we will focus primarily on the net profit margin through-
out the book and simply call it the “profit margin.”
Basic Earning Power (BEP) Ratio
The basic earning power (BEP) ratio is calculated by dividing earnings before in-
terest and taxes (EBIT) by total assets:
98
Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

Basic earning power ðBEPÞ ratio ¼
EBIT
Total assets
¼ $283:8
$2;000 ¼ 14:2%
Industry average ¼ 17:2%
This ratio shows the raw earning power of the firm’s assets before the influence of
taxes and leverage, and it is useful for comparing firms with different tax situations
and different degrees of financial leverage. Because of its low turnover ratios and
low profit margin on sales, MicroDrive is not getting as high a return on its assets
as is the average company in its industry.9
Return on Total Assets
The ratio of net income to total assets measures the return on total assets (ROA)
after interest and taxes. This ratio is also called the return on assets and is defined as
follows:
The World Might be Flat, but Global Accounting is Bumpy!
The Case of IFRS versus FASB
In a flat world, distance is no barrier. Work flows to
where it can be accomplished most efficiently, and cap-
ital flows to where it can be invested most profitably. If
a radiologist in India is more efficient than one in the
United States, then images will be e-mailed to India
for diagnosis; if rates of return are higher in Brazil,
then investors throughout the world will provide fund-
ing for Brazilian projects. One key to “flattening” the
world is agreement on common standards. For exam-
ple, there are common Internet standards so that users
throughout the world are able to communicate.
A glaring exception to standardization is in account-
ing. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in
the United States requires firms to comply with stan-
dards set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB). But the European Union requires all EU-listed
companies to comply with the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as defined by the Interna-
tional Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
IFRS tends to rely on general principles, whereas
FASB standards are rules-based. As the recent ac-
counting scandals demonstrate, many U.S. compa-
nies have been able to comply with U.S. rules while
violating the principle, or intent, underlying the rules.
The United States is likely to adopt IFRS, or a slightly
modified IFRS, but the question is “When?” The SEC
estimated that a large company is likely to incur
costs of up to $32 million when switching to IFRS.
So even though a survey by the accounting firm
KPMG indicates that most investors and analysts fa-
vor adoption of IFRS, the path to adoption is likely to
be bumpy.

Global Accounting Standards,” January 15, 2009, at http://

ary 3, 2009, at http://www.webcpa.com.
9Notice that EBIT is earned throughout the year, whereas the total assets figure is an end-of-the-year
number. Therefore, it would be better, conceptually, to calculate this ratio as EBIT/(Average assets)
= EBIT/[(Beginning assets + Ending assets)/2]. We have not made this adjustment because the published
ratios used for comparative purposes do not include it. However, when we construct our own comparative
ratios, we do make this adjustment. The same adjustment would also be appropriate for the next two ra-
tios, ROA and ROE.
Chapter 3: Analysis of Financial Statements
99

Return on
total assets ¼ ROA ¼
Net income available to
common stockholders
Total assets
¼ $113:5
$2;000 ¼ 5:7%
Industry average ¼ 9:0%
MicroDrive’s 5.7% return is well below the 9% average for the industry. This low
return is due to (1) the company’s low basic earning power and (2) high interest costs
resulting from its above-average use of debt; both of these factors cause MicroDrive’s
net income to be relatively low.
Return on Common Equity
The ratio of net income to common equity measures the return on common equity
(ROE):
Return on
common equity ¼ ROE ¼
Net income available to
common stockholders
Common equity
¼ $113:5
$896
¼ 12:7%
Industry average ¼ 15:0%
Stockholders invest to earn a return on their money, and this ratio tells how well they
are doing in an accounting sense. MicroDrive’s 12.7% return is below the 15% in-
dustry average, but not as far below as its return on total assets. This somewhat bet-
ter result is due to the company’s greater use of debt, a point that we explain in detail
later in the chapter.

margin? (5%) What is its ROA? (10%) What is its ROE? (20%) Would ROA increase if
the firm used less leverage? (Yes) Would ROE increase? (No)
3.6 MARKET VALUE RATIOS
Market value ratios relate a firm’s stock price to its earnings, cash flow, and book
value per share. Market value ratios are a way to measure the value of a company’s
stock relative to that of another company.
Price/Earnings Ratio
The price/earnings (P/E) ratio shows how much investors are willing to pay per
dollar of reported profits. MicroDrive’s stock sells for $23, so with an earnings per
share (EPS) of $2.27 its P/E ratio is 10.1:
100
Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

Price=earnings ðP=EÞ ratio ¼
Price per share
Earnings per share
¼ $23:00
$2:27 ¼ 10:1
Industry average ¼ 12:5
Price/earnings ratios are higher for firms with strong growth prospects, other things
held constant, but they are lower for riskier firms. Because MicroDrive’s P/E ratio is
below the average, this suggests that the company is regarded as being somewhat
riskier than most, as having poorer growth prospects, or both. In early 2009, the av-
erage P/E ratio for firms in the S&P 500 was 12.54, indicating that investors were
willing to pay $12.54 for every dollar of earnings.
Price/Cash Flow Ratio
Stock prices depend on a company’s ability to generate cash flows. Consequently, in-
vestors often look at the price/cash flow ratio, where cash flow is defined as net in-
come plus depreciation and amortization:
Price=cash flow ratio ¼
Price per share
Cash flow per share
¼ $23:00
$4:27 ¼ 5:4
Industry average ¼ 6:8
MicroDrive’s price/cash flow ratio is also below the industry average, once again
suggesting that its growth prospects are below average, its risk is above average,
or both.
The price/EBITDA ratio is similar to the price/cash flow ratio, except the price/
EBITDA ratio measures performance before the impact of interest expenses and
taxes, making it a better measure of operating performance. MicroDrive’s EBITDA
per share is $383.8/50 = $7.676, so its price/EBITDA is $23/$7.676 = 3.0. The indus-
try average price/EBITDA ratio is 4.6, so we see again that MicroDrive is below the
industry average.
Note that some analysts look at other multiples as well. For example, depending
on the industry, some may look at measures such as price/sales or price/customers.
Ultimately, though, value depends on free cash flows, so if these “exotic” ratios do
not forecast future free cash flow, they may turn out to be misleading. This was
true in the case of the dot-com retailers before they crashed and burned in 2000,
costing investors many billions.
Market/Book Ratio
The ratio of a stock’s market price to its book value gives another indication of how
investors regard the company. Companies with relatively high rates of return on eq-
uity generally sell at higher multiples of book value than those with low returns.
First, we find MicroDrive’s book value per share:
Chapter 3: Analysis of Financial Statements
101

Book value per share ¼ Common equity
Shares outstanding
¼ $896
50
¼ $17:92
Now we divide the market price by the book value to get a market/book (M/B)
ratio of 1.3 times:
Market=book ratio ¼ M=B ¼ Market price per share
Book value per share
¼ $23:00
$17:92 ¼ 1:3
Industry average ¼ 1:7
Investors are willing to pay relatively little for a dollar of MicroDrive’s book value.
The average company in the S&P 500 had a market/book ratio of about 2.50 in
early 2009. Since M/B ratios typically exceed 1.0, this means that investors are willing
to pay more for stocks than their accounting book values. The book value is a record
of the past, showing the cumulative amount that stockholders have invested, either
directly by purchasing newly issued shares or indirectly through retaining earnings.
In contrast, the market price is forward-looking, incorporating investors’ expectations
of future cash flows. For example, in early 2009 Alaska Air had a market/book ratio
of only 0.81, reflecting the airline industry’s problems, whereas Apple’s market/book
ratio was 3.45, indicating that investors expected Apple’s past successes to continue.
Table 3-2 summarizes MicroDrive’s financial ratios. As the table indicates, the
company has many problems.
Self-Test
Describe three ratios that relate a firm’s stock price to its earnings, cash flow, and
book value per share, and write out their equations.
What does the price/earnings (P/E) ratio show? If one firm’s P/E ratio is lower than
that of another, what are some factors that might explain the difference?
How is book value per share calculated? Explain why book values often deviate from
market values.
A company has $6 billion of net income, $2 billion of depreciation and amortization,
$80 billion of common equity, and 1 billion shares of stock. If its stock price is $96
per share, what is its price/earnings ratio? (16) Its price/cash flow ratio? (12) Its mar-
ket/book ratio? (1.2)
3.7 TREND ANALYSIS, COMMON SIZE ANALYSIS,
AND PERCENTAGE CHANGE ANALYSIS
Trends give clues as to whether a firm’s financial condition is likely to improve or
deteriorate. To do a trend analysis, you examine a ratio over time, as shown in
Figure 3-1. This graph shows that MicroDrive’s rate of return on common equity
has been declining since 2007, even though the industry average has been relatively
stable. All the other ratios could be analyzed similarly.
In a common size analysis, all income statement items are divided by sales and
all balance sheet items are divided by total assets. Thus, a common size income state-

ment shows each item as a percentage of sales, and a common size balance sheet
shows each item as a percentage of total assets.10 The advantage of common size
analysis is that it facilitates comparisons of balance sheets and income statements
over time and across companies.
Common size statements are easy to generate if the financial statements are in a
spreadsheet. In fact, if you obtain your data from a source that uses standardized
financial statements, then it is easy to cut and paste the data for a new company
over your original company’s data, and all of your spreadsheet formulas will be valid
for the new company. We generated Figure 3-2 in the Excel file Ch03 Tool Kit.xls.
Figure 3-2 shows MicroDrive’s 2009 and 2010 common size income statements,
along with the composite statement for the industry. (Note: Rounding may cause ad-
dition/subtraction differences in Figures 3-2, 3-3, and 3-4.) MicroDrive’s EBIT is
slightly below average, and its interest expenses are slightly above average. The net
effect is a relatively low profit margin.
Figure 3-3 shows MicroDrive’s common size balance sheets along with the industry
composite. Its accounts receivable are significantly higher than the industry average, its
inventories are significantly higher, and it uses much more debt than the average firm.
In percentage change analysis, growth rates are calculated for all income statement
items and balance sheet accounts relative to a base year. To illustrate, Figure 3-4 contains
MicroDrive’s income statement percentage change analysis for 2010 relative to 2009. Sales
increased at a 5.3% rate during 2010, but EBITDA increased by 8.7%. This “good news”
was offset by a 46.7% increase in interest expense. The significant growth in interest
expense caused growth in net income to be negative. Thus, the percentage change analy-
sis points out that the decrease in net income in 2010 resulted almost exclusively from an
increase in interest expense. This conclusion could be reached by analyzing dollar

amounts, but percentage change analysis simplifies the task. We apply the same type of
analysis to the balance sheets (see the file Ch03 Tool Kit.xls), which shows that invento-
ries grew at a whopping 48.2% rate. With only a 5.3% growth in sales, the extreme
growth in inventories should be of great concern to MicroDrive’s managers.

3.8 TYING THE RATIOS TOGETHER:
THE DU PONT EQUATION
In ratio analysis, it is sometimes easy to miss the forest for all the trees. The Du
Pont equation provides a framework that ties together a firm’s profitability, asset
efficiency, and use of debt. The return on assets (ROA) can be expressed as the profit
margin multiplied by the total assets turnover ratio:
ROA ¼ Profit margin × Total assets turnover
¼ Net income
Sales
×
Sales
Total assets
(3-1)
For MicroDrive, the ROA is
ROA = 3.8% × 1.5 = 5.7%
MicroDrive made 3.8%, or 3.8 cents, on each dollar of sales, and its assets were
turned over 1.5 times during the year. Therefore, the company earned a return of
5.7% on its assets.
To find the return on equity (ROE), multiply the ROA by the equity multiplier,
which is the ratio of assets to common equity:
Equity multiplier ¼
Total assets
Common equity
(3-2)
Firms that have a lot of leverage (i.e., a lot of liabilities or preferred stock) have a
high equity multiplier because the assets are financed with a relatively smaller
amount of equity. Therefore, the return on equity (ROE) depends on the ROA and
the use of leverage:

Combining Equations 3-1 and 3-3 gives the extended, or modified, Du Pont equation,

multiplier combine to determine the ROE:

For MicroDrive, we have

¼ 12:7%
The insights provided by the Du Pont model are valuable, and the model can be used
for “quick and dirty” estimates of the impact that operating changes have on returns. For
example, holding all else equal, if MicroDrive can implement lean production techniques
and increase to 1.8 its ratio of sales to total assets, then its ROE will improve to
(3.8%)(1.8)(2.23) = 15.25%. For a more complete “what if” analysis, most companies
use a forecasting model such as the one described in Chapter 12.

basic determinants of ROE.

3.9 COMPARATIVE RATIOS AND BENCHMARKING
Ratio analysis involves comparisons. A company’s ratios are compared with those of
other firms in the same industry—that is, with industry average figures. However, like
most firms, MicroDrive’s managers go one step further: they also compare their ratios
with those of a smaller set of the leading computer companies. This technique is called
benchmarking, and the companies used for the comparison are called benchmark
companies. For example, MicroDrive benchmarks against five other firms that its man-
agement considers to be the best-managed companies with operations similar to its own.
Many companies also benchmark various parts of their overall operation against top
companies, whether they are in the same industry or not. For example, MicroDrive has a
division that sells hard drives directly to consumers through catalogs and the Internet. This
division’s shipping department benchmarks against L.L.Bean, even though they are in dif-
ferent industries, because L.L.Bean’s shipping department is one of the best. MicroDrive
wants its own shippers to strive to match L.L.Bean’s record for on-time shipments.
Chapter 3: Analysis of Financial Statements
107

Comparative ratios are available from a number of sources, including Value Line, Dun
and Bradstreet (D&B), and the Annual Statement Studies published by Risk Management
Associates, which is the national association of bank loan officers. Table 3-3 reports se-
lected ratios from Reuters for Apple and its industry, revealing that Apple has a much
higher profit margin and lower debt ratio than its peers.
Each data-supplying organization uses a somewhat different set of ratios designed for
its own purposes. For example, D&B deals mainly with small firms, many of which are
proprietorships, and it sells its services primarily to banks and other lenders. Therefore,
D&B is concerned largely with the creditor’s viewpoint, and its ratios emphasize current
assets and liabilities, not market value ratios. So, when you select a comparative data
source, you should be sure that your own emphasis is similar to that of the agency whose
ratios you plan to use. Additionally, there are often definitional differences in the ratios
presented by different sources, so before using a source, be sure to verify the exact defi-
nitions of the ratios to ensure consistency with your own work.

Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

1. Many large firms operate different divisions in different industries, and for such
companies it is difficult to develop a meaningful set of industry averages. There-
fore, industry averages are more applicable to small, narrowly focused firms than
to large, multidivisional ones.
2. To set goals for high-level performance, it is best to benchmark on the industry
leaders’ ratios rather than the industry average ratios.
3. Inflation may have badly distorted firms’ balance sheets—reported values are often
substantially different from “true” values. Further, because inflation affects depre-
ciation charges and inventory costs, reported profits are also affected. Thus, infla-
tion can distort a ratio analysis for one firm over time or a comparative analysis of
firms of different ages.
4. Seasonal factors can also distort a ratio analysis. For example, the inventory
turnover ratio for a food processor will be radically different if the balance
sheet figure used for inventory is the one just before versus the one just after
the close of the canning season. This problem can be minimized by using
monthly averages for inventory (and receivables) when calculating turnover
ratios.
5. Firms can employ “window dressing” techniques to make their financial state-
ments look stronger. To illustrate, suppose a company takes out a 2-year loan in
late December. Because the loan is for more than one year, it is not included in
current liabilities even though the cash received through the loan is reported as a
current asset. This improves the current and quick ratios and makes the year-end
balance sheet look stronger. If the company pays the loan back in January, then
the transaction was strictly window dressing.
6. Companies’ choices of different accounting practices can distort comparisons. For
example, choices of different inventory valuation and depreciation methods affect
financial statements differently, making comparisons among companies less mean-
ingful. As another example, if one firm leases a substantial amount of its produc-
tive equipment, then its assets may appear low relative to sales (because leased
assets often do not appear on the balance sheet) and its debt may appear low (be-
cause the liability associated with the lease obligation may not be shown as debt).11
In summary, conducting ratio analysis in a mechanical, unthinking manner is
dangerous, but when ratio analysis is used intelligently and with good judgment, it
can provide useful insights into a firm’s operations and identify the right questions
to ask.

List several potential problems with ratio analysis.
3.11 LOOKING BEYOND THE NUMBERS
Sound financial analysis involves more than just calculating and comparing ratios—
qualitative factors must be considered. Here are some questions suggested by the
American Association of Individual Investors (AAII).
1. To what extent are the company’s revenues tied to one key customer or to one
key product? To what extent does the company rely on a single supplier? Reliance
on single customers, products, or suppliers increases risk.
2. What percentage of the company’s business is generated overseas? Companies
with a large percentage of overseas business are exposed to risk of currency
exchange volatility and political instability.
3. What are the probable actions of current competitors and the likelihood of
additional new competitors?
4. Do the company’s future prospects depend critically on the success of products
currently in the pipeline or on existing products?
5. How does the legal and regulatory environment affect the company?
Self-Test
What are some qualitative factors that analysts should consider when evaluating a
company’s likely future financial performance?
Summary
This chapter explained techniques used by investors and managers to analyze finan-
cial statements. The key concepts covered are listed below.
•
Liquidity ratios show the relationship of a firm’s current assets to its current
liabilities and thus its ability to meet maturing debts. Two commonly used
liquidity ratios are the current ratio and the quick, or acid test, ratio.
•
Asset management ratios measure how effectively a firm is managing its assets.
These ratios include inventory turnover, days sales outstanding, fixed assets
turnover, and total assets turnover.
•
Debt management ratios reveal (1) the extent to which the firm is financed
with debt and (2) its likelihood of defaulting on its debt obligations. They
include the debt ratio, the times-interest-earned ratio, and the EBITDA
coverage ratio.
•
Profitability ratios show the combined effects of liquidity, asset management,
and debt management policies on operating results. They include the net profit
margin (also called the profit margin on sales), the basic earning power ratio,
the return on total assets, and the return on common equity.
•
Market value ratios relate the firm’s stock price to its earnings, cash flow, and
book value per share, thus giving management an indication of what investors
think of the company’s past performance and future prospects. These include the
price/earnings ratio, the price/cash flow ratio, and the market/book ratio.
•
Trend analysis, in which one plots a ratio over time, is important because it reveals
whether the firm’s condition has been improving or deteriorating over time.
•
The Du Pont system is designed to show how the profit margin on sales, the
assets turnover ratio, and the use of debt all interact to determine the rate of
110
Part 1: Fundamental Concepts of Corporate Finance

return on equity. The firm’s management can use the Du Pont system to analyze
ways of improving performance.
•
Benchmarking is the process of comparing a particular company with a group
of similar successful companies.
Ratio analysis has limitations, but when used with care and judgment it can be very
helpful.

Ratio Analysis
The following data apply to Jacobus and Associates (millions of dollars):
Jacobus has no preferred stock—only common equity, current liabilities, and long-

a. Find Jacobus’s (1) accounts receivable, (2) current liabilities, (3) current assets,
(4) total assets, (5) ROA, (6) common equity, and (7) long-term debt.
b. In part a, you should have found Jacobus’s accounts receivable = $111.1 million.
If Jacobus could reduce its DSO from 40.55 days to 30.4 days while holding
other things constant, how much cash would it generate? If this cash were used
to buy back common stock (at book value), thus reducing the amount of common
equity, how would this affect (1) the ROE, (2) the ROA, and (3) the ratio of total
debt to total assets?

Comprehensive Ratio
Analysis
The Jimenez Corporation’s forecasted 2011 financial statements follow, along with
some industry average ratios.
a. Calculate Jimenez’s 2011 forecasted ratios, compare them with the industry average
data, and comment briefly on Jimenez’s projected strengths and weaknesses.
b. What do you think would happen to Jimenez’s ratios if the company initiated
cost-cutting measures that allowed it to hold lower levels of inventory and
substantially decreased the cost of goods sold? No calculations are necessary:
Think about which ratios would be affected by changes in these two
accounts.

Mini Case
The first part of the case, presented in Chapter 2, discussed the situation of Computron In-
dustries after an expansion program. A large loss occurred in 2010, rather than the expected
profit. As a result, its managers, directors, and investors are concerned about the firm’s
survival.
Donna Jamison was brought in as assistant to Fred Campo, Computron’s chairman, who
had the task of getting the company back into a sound financial position. Computron’s 2009
and 2010 balance sheets and income statements, together with projections for 2011, are shown
in the following tables. The tables also show the 2009 and 2010 financial ratios, along with in-
dustry average data. The 2011 projected financial statement data represent Jamison’s and
Campo’s best guess for 2011 results, assuming that some new financing is arranged to get the
company “over the hump.”
Jamison must prepare an analysis of where the company is now, what it must do to regain its
financial health, and what actions should be taken. Your assignment is to help her answer the
following questions. Provide clear explanations, not yes or no answers.
a. Why are ratios useful? What three groups use ratio analysis and for what reasons?
b. Calculate the 2011 current and quick ratios based on the projected balance sheet and
income statement data. What can you say about the company’s liquidity position in
2009, 2010, and as projected for 2011? We often think of ratios as being useful (1) to
managers to help run the business, (2) to bankers for credit analysis, and (3) to stock-
holders for stock valuation. Would these different types of analysts have an equal inter-
est in the liquidity ratios?
c. Calculate the 2011 inventory turnover, days sales outstanding (DSO), fixed assets turn-
over, and total assets turnover. How does Computron’s utilization of assets stack up
against that of other firms in its industry?

hen you graduate and go to work, either a defined benefit (DB) or a
defined contribution (DC) pension plan will almost certainly be part of
your compensation package. Under a DB plan, the company will put
funds into its pension fund, which will then invest in stocks, bonds, real
estate, and so forth and then use those funds to make the promised
payments after you retire. Under a DC plan, the company will put money
into your 401(k) plan (which is essentially a mutual fund), you will decide
what type of assets to buy, and you will withdraw money after you retire.
The analysis required to set up a good retirement program is based on the
subject of this chapter, the time value of money (TVM).
How do you suppose a stock market crash like we had in 2008, with
the average stock down about 40%, will affect DB and DC retirement
plans? If you have a 401(k) plan that holds stocks, as most people do,
TVM analysis would show clearly that you will have to work longer than
you expected, reduce your post-retirement standard of living, or both.
With a DB plan, a stock market decline reduces the value of the
investments set aside for you by the company. If there is also a decline in
interest rates, as there was in 2008, TVM analysis shows that the amount
of money the company should set aside for you goes up. Thus, the
company’s pension funding status, which is the difference between the
value of the pension plan’s investments and the amount the plan should
have
on
hand
to
cover
the
future
obligations,
becomes
severely
underfunded if the market crashes and interest rates fall. This can even
lead to bankruptcy, in which case you might end up with retirement
payments from the government instead of from the company, with the
government’s
payments
a
lot
lower
than
those
promised
by
the
company’s plan. If you don’t believe us, ask someone who recently
retired from a bankrupt airline or auto company.1
1If you want to see something alarming, apply the procedures set forth in this chapter to the pension plan
of almost any municipal government. Politicians find it a lot easier to promise high future benefits than to
raise taxes to pay for those benefits. Of course, the federal government is doing the same thing with Social
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and with federal employees. Politicians need to study this chapter!
123

In Chapter 1 we saw that the primary objective of financial management is to maximize
the intrinsic value of a firm’s stock. We also saw that stock values depend on the timing of the
cash flows investors expect from an investment—a dollar expected sooner is worth more
than a dollar expected further in the future. Therefore, it is essential for financial managers
to understand the time value of money and its impact on stock prices. In this chapter we will
explain exactly how the timing of cash flows affects asset values and rates of return.
The principles of time value analysis have many applications, including retirement plan-
ning, loan payment schedules, and decisions to invest (or not) in new equipment. In fact, of
all the concepts used in finance, none is more important than the time value of money (TVM),
also called discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. Time value concepts are used throughout
the remainder of the book, so it is vital that you understand the material in Chapter 4 and
be able to work the chapter’s problems before you move on to other topics.2
Corporate Valuation and the Time Value of Money
In Chapter 1 we explained (1) that managers should
strive to make their firms more valuable and (2) that
the value of a firm is determined by the size, timing,
and risk of its free cash flows (FCF). Recall from
Chapter 2 that free cash flows are the cash flows
available for distribution to all of a firm’s investors
(stockholders and creditors). We explain how to cal-
culate the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
in Chapter 9, but it is enough for now to think of the
WACC as the average rate of return required by all of
the firm’s investors. The intrinsic value of a company
is given by the following diagram.

2The problems can be worked with either a calculator or an Excel spreadsheet. Calculator manuals tend to
be long and complicated, partly because they cover a number of topics that aren’t used in the basic
finance course. Therefore, on this textbook’s Web site we provide tutorials for the most commonly used
calculators. The tutorials are keyed to this chapter, and they show exactly how to do the calculations
used in the chapter. If you don’t know how to use your calculator, go to the Web site, get the relevant
tutorial, and go through it as you study the chapter. The chapter’s Tool Kit also explains how to do all
of the within-chapter calculations using Excel. The Tool Kit, along with an Excel tutorial designed for this
book, is provided on the book’s Web site.

Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

4.1 TIME LINES
The first step in a time value analysis is to set up a time line to help you visualize
what’s happening in the particular problem. To illustrate, consider the following
diagram, where PV represents $100 that is in a bank account today and FV is the
value that will be in the account at some future time (3 years from now in this
example):
Periods
Cash
PV=$100
FV=?
0
1
5%
2
3
The intervals from 0 to 1, 1 to 2, and 2 to 3 are time periods such as years
or months. Time 0 is today, and it is the beginning of Period 1; Time 1 is one
period from today, and it is both the end of Period 1 and the beginning of
Period 2; and so on. In our example the periods are years, but they could also
be quarters or months or even days. Note again that each tick mark corresponds
to both the end of one period and the beginning of the next one. Thus, if the per-
iods are years, the tick mark at Time 2 represents both the end of Year 2 and the
beginning of Year 3.
Cash flows are shown directly below the tick marks, and the relevant interest rate
is shown just above the time line. Unknown cash flows, which you are trying to find,
are indicated by question marks. Here the interest rate is 5%; a single cash outflow,
$100, is invested at Time 0; and the Time-3 value is unknown and must be found.
In this example, cash flows occur only at Times 0 and 3, with no flows at Times
1 or 2. We will, of course, deal with situations where multiple cash flows occur.
Note also that in our example the interest rate is constant for all 3 years. The interest
rate is generally held constant, but if it varies then in the diagram we show different
rates for the different periods.
Time lines are especially important when you are first learning time value con-
cepts, but even experts use them to analyze complex problems. Throughout the
book, our procedure is to set up a time line to show what’s happening, provide
an equation that must be solved to find the answer, and then explain how to solve
the equation with a regular calculator, a financial calculator, and a computer
spreadsheet.
Self-Test
Do time lines deal only with years, or could other periods be used?
Set up a time line to illustrate the following situation: You currently have $2,000 in a
3-year certificate of deposit (CD) that pays a guaranteed 4% annually. You want to
know the value of the CD after 3 years.
4.2 FUTURE VALUES
A dollar in hand today is worth more than a dollar to be received in the future—if
you had the dollar now you could invest it, earn interest, and end up with more
than one dollar in the future. The process of going forward, from present values
(PVs) to future values (FVs), is called compounding. To illustrate, refer back to
our 3-year time line and assume that you have $100 in a bank account that pays a
guaranteed 5% interest each year. How much would you have at the end of Year 3?
We first define some terms, after which we set up a time line and show how the
future value is calculated.

PV
= Present value, or beginning amount. In our example, PV = $100.
FVN = Future value, or ending amount, in the account after N periods. Whereas
PV is the value now, or the present value, FVN is the value N periods into
the future, after interest earned has been added to the account.
CFt = Cash flow. Cash flows can be positive or negative. For a borrower, the
first cash flow is positive and the subsequent cash flows are negative, and
the reverse holds for a lender. The cash flow for a particular period is
often given a subscript, CFt, where t is the period. Thus, CF0 = PV = the
cash flow at Time 0, whereas CF3 would be the cash flow at the end of
Period 3. In this example the cash flows occur at the ends of the periods,
but in some problems they occur at the beginning.
I = Interest rate earned per year. (Sometimes a lowercase i is used.) Interest
earned is based on the balance at the beginning of each year, and we assume
that interest is paid at the end of the year. Here I = 5% or, expressed as a
decimal, 0.05. Throughout this chapter, we designate the interest rate as I
(or I/YR, for interest rate per year) because that symbol is used on most
financial calculators. Note, though, that in later chapters we use the symbol
“r” to denote the rate because r (for rate of return) is used more often in the
finance literature. Also, in this chapter we generally assume that interest
payments are guaranteed by the U.S. government and hence are riskless
(i.e., certain). In later chapters we will deal with risky investments, where
the rate actually earned might be different from its expected level.
INT = Dollars of interest earned during the year = (Beginning amount) × I. In
our example, INT = $100(0.05) = $5 for Year 1, but it rises in subsequent
years as the amount at the beginning of each year increases.
N= Number of periods involved in the analysis. In our example, N = 3.
Sometimes the number of periods is designated with a lowercase n, so
both N and n indicate number of periods.
We can use four different procedures to solve time value problems.3 These methods
are described next.
Step-by-Step Approach
The time line itself can be modified and used to find the FV of $100 compounded
for 3 years at 5%, as shown below:
Time
Amount at beginning of period
$100.00
0
2
1
5%
3
$105.00
$110.25
$115.76
3A fifth procedure is called the tabular approach, which uses tables that provide “interest factors;” this pro-
cedure was used before financial calculators and computers became available. Now, though, calculators
and spreadsheets such as Excel are programmed to calculate the specific factor needed for a given problem,
which is then used to find the FV. This is much more efficient than using the tables. Also, calculators and
spreadsheets can handle fractional periods and fractional interest rates. For these reasons, tables are not
used in business today; hence we do not discuss them in the text. However, because some professors cover
the tables for pedagogic purposes, we discuss them in Web Extension 4A, on the textbook’s Web site.

Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

We start with $100 in the account, which is shown at t = 0. We then multiply the
initial amount, and each succeeding beginning-of-year amount, by (1 + I) = (1.05).
•
You earn $100(0.05) = $5 of interest during the first year, so the amount at the
end of Year 1 (or at t = 1) is
FV1 ¼ PV þ INT
¼ PV þ PVðIÞ
¼ PVð1 þ IÞ
¼ $100ð1 þ 0:05Þ ¼ $100ð1:05Þ ¼ $105
•
We begin the second year with $105, earn 0.05($105) = $5.25 on the now larger
beginning-of-period amount, and end the year with $110.25. Interest during
Year 2 is $5.25, and it is higher than the first year’s interest, $5, because we
earned $5(0.05) = $0.25 interest on the first year’s interest. This is called “com-
pounding,” and interest earned on interest is called “compound interest.”
•
This process continues, and because the beginning balance is higher in each
successive year, the interest earned each year increases.
•
The total interest earned, $15.76, is reflected in the final balance, $115.76.
The step-by-step approach is useful because it shows exactly what is happening. How-
ever, this approach is time-consuming, especially if the number of years is large and you
are using a calculator rather than Excel, so streamlined procedures have been developed.
Formula Approach
In the step-by-step approach, we multiplied the amount at the beginning of each period by
(1 + I) = (1.05). Notice that the value at the end of Year 2 is
FV2 ¼ FV1ð1 þ IÞ
¼ PVð1 þ IÞð1 þ IÞ
¼ PVð1 þ IÞ2
¼ 100ð1:05Þ2 ¼ $110:25
If N = 3, then we multiply PV by (1 + I) three different times, which is the same as
multiplying the beginning amount by (1 + I)3. This concept can be extended, and the
result is this key equation:
FVN ¼ PVð1 þ IÞN
(4-1)
We can apply Equation 4-1 to find the FV in our example:
FV3 ¼ $100ð1:05Þ3 ¼ $115:76
Equation 4-1 can be used with any calculator, even a nonfinancial calculator that has an
exponential function, making it easy to find FVs no matter how many years are involved.
Financial Calculators
Financial calculators were designed specifically to solve time value problems. First,
note that financial calculators have five keys that correspond to the five variables in
the basic time value equations. Equation 4-1 has only four variables, but we will
shortly deal with situations where a fifth variable (a set of periodic additional
Chapter 4: Time Value of Money
127

payments) is involved. We show the inputs for our example above their keys in the
following diagram, and the output, which is the FV, below its key. Since in this ex-
ample there are no periodic payments, we enter 0 for PMT. We describe the keys in
more detail below the diagram.
N = Number of periods = 3. Some calculators use n rather than N.
I/YR = Interest rate per period = 5. Some calculators use i or I rather than
I/YR. Calculators are programmed to automatically convert the 5 to the
decimal 0.05 before doing the arithmetic.
PV = Present value = 100. In our example we begin by making a deposit,
which is an outflow of 100, so the PV is entered with a negative sign.
On most calculators you must enter the 100, then press the +/– key to
switch from +100 to –100. If you enter –100 directly, this will subtract
100 from the last number in the calculator, which will give you an
incorrect answer unless the last number was zero.
PMT = Payment. This key is used if we have a series of equal, or constant,
payments. Since there are no such payments in our current problem, we
enter PMT = 0. We will use the PMT key later in this chapter.
FV = Future value. In our example, the calculator automatically shows the FV
as a positive number because we entered the PV as a negative number. If
we had entered the 100 as a positive number, then the FV would have
been negative. Calculators automatically assume that either the PV or
the FV must be negative.
As noted in our example, you first enter the four known values (N, I/YR, PMT, and
PV) and then press the FV key to get the answer, FV = 115.76.
Spreadsheets
Spreadsheets are ideally suited for solving many financial problems, including those
dealing with the time value of money.4 Spreadsheets are obviously useful for calcula-
tions, but they can also be used like a word processor to create exhibits like our
Figure 4-1, which includes text, drawings, and calculations. We use this figure to
show that four methods can be used to find the FV of $100 after 3 years at an interest
rate of 5%. The time line on Rows 43 to 45 is useful for visualizing the problem, after
which the spreadsheet calculates the required answer. Note that the letters across the
top designate columns, the numbers down the left column designate rows, and the
rows and columns jointly designate cells. Thus, cell C39 shows the amount of the in-
vestment, $100, and it is given a minus sign because it is an outflow.

Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

It is useful to put all of the problem’s inputs in a section of the spreadsheet desig-
nated “Inputs.” In Figure 4-1 we put the inputs in the range A38:C41, with C39 be-
ing the cell where we specify the investment, C40 the interest rate, and C41 the
number of periods. We can use these three cell references, rather than the fixed
numbers themselves, in the formulas in the remainder of the model. This makes it
easy to modify the problem by changing the inputs and then having the new data
automatically used in the calculations.
Time lines are important for solving finance problems because they help us visu-
alize what’s happening. When we work a problem by hand we usually draw a time
line, and when we work a problem with Excel, we actually set the model up as a
time line. For example, in Figure 4-1 Rows 43 to 45 are indeed a time line. It’s easy
Hints on Using Financial Calculators
When using a financial calculator, make sure your ma-
chine is set up as indicated below. Refer to your calcu-
lator manual or to our calculator tutorial on the text’s
Web site for information on setting up your calculator.
◆One payment per period. Many calculators
“come out of the box” assuming that 12 pay-
ments are made per year; that is, they assume
monthly payments. However, in this book we
generally deal with problems in which only one
payment is made each year. Therefore, you
should set your calculator at one payment per
year and leave it there. See our tutorial or your
calculator manual if you need assistance. We
will show you how to solve problems with more
than 1 payment per year in Section 4.15.
◆End mode. With most contracts, payments are
made at the end of each period. However, some
contracts call for payments at the beginning of
each period. You can switch between “End
Mode” and “Begin Mode” depending on the
problem you are solving. Because most of the
problems in this book call for end-of-period
payments, you should return your calculator to
End Mode after you work a problem in which
payments are made at the beginning of periods.
◆Negative sign for outflows. When first learning
how to use financial calculators, students often
forget that one cash flow must be negative.
Mathematically, financial calculators solve a
version of this equation:
PVð1 þ IÞN þ FVN ¼ 0
(4-2)
Notice that for reasonable values of I, either PV or
FVN must be negative, and the other one must be
positive to make the equation equal 0. This is rea-
sonable because, in all realistic situations, one
cash flow is an outflow (which should have a
negative sign) and one is an inflow (which should
have a positive sign). For example, if you make a
deposit (which is an outflow, and hence should
have a negative sign) then you will expect to make
a later withdrawal (which is an inflow with a posi-
tive sign). The bottom line is that one of your
inputs for a cash flow must be negative and one
must be positive. This generally means typing the
outflow as a positive number and then pressing
the +/– key to convert from + to – before hitting the
enter key.
◆Decimal places. When doing arithmetic, calcula-
tors use a great many decimal places. However,
they allow you to show from 0 to 11 decimal
places on the display. When working with dollars,
we generally specify two decimal places. When
dealing with interest rates, we generally specify
two places if the rate is expressed as a percentage,
like 5.25%, but we specify four places if the rate is
expressed as a decimal, like 0.0525.
◆Interest rates. For arithmetic operations with a
nonfinancial calculator, the rate 5.25% must be
stated as a decimal, .0525. However, with a
financial calculator you must enter 5.25, not
.0525, because financial calculators are pro-
grammed to assume that rates are stated as
percentages.

to construct time lines with Excel, with each column designating a different period on
the time line.
On Row 47 we use Excel to go through the step-by-step calculations, multiplying
the beginning-of-year values by (1 + I) to find the compounded value at the end of
each period. Cell G47 shows the final result of the step-by-step approach.
We illustrate the formula approach in Row 49, using Excel to solve Equation 4-1
to find the FV. Cell G49 shows the formula result, $115.76. As it must, it equals the
step-by-step result.
Rows 51 to 53 illustrate the financial calculator approach, which again produces
the same answer, $115.76.
The last section, in Rows 55 to 58, illustrates Excel’s future value (FV) function.
You can access the function wizard by clicking the fx symbol in Excel’s formula bar.
Then select the category for Financial functions, and then the FV function, which
is =FV(I,N,0,PV), as shown in Cell E55.5 Cell E56 shows how the formula would
look with numbers as inputs; the actual function itself is entered in Cell G56, but it
shows up in the table as the answer, $115.76. If you access the model and put the
pointer on Cell G56, you will see the full formula. Finally, Cell E57 shows how
the formula would look with cell references rather than fixed values as inputs, with

to Excel’s notation.

the actual function again in Cell G57. We generally use cell references as function
inputs because this makes it easy to change inputs and see how those changes affect
the output. This is called “sensitivity analysis.” Many real-world financial applications
use sensitivity analysis, so it is useful to get in the habit of setting up an input data
section and then using cell references rather than fixed numbers in the functions.
When entering interest rates in Excel, you can use either actual numbers or
percentages, depending on how the cell is formatted. For example, in cell C40,
we first formatted to Percentage, and then typed in 5, which showed up as 5%.
However, Excel uses 0.05 for the arithmetic. Alternatively, we could have format-
ted C40 as a Number, in which case we would have typed “0.05.” If C40 is for-
matted to Number and you enter 5, then Excel would think you meant 500%.
Thus, Excel’s procedure is quite different from the convention used in financial
calculators.
Comparing the Procedures
The first step in solving any time value problem is to understand what is happening
and then to diagram it on a time line. Woody Allen said that 90% of success is just
showing up. With time value problems, 90% of success is correctly setting up the
time line.
After you diagram the problem on a time line, your next step is to pick one of the
four approaches shown in Figure 4-1 to solve the problem. Any may be used, but
your choice of method will depend on the particular situation.
All business students should know Equation 4-1 by heart and should also know
how to use a financial calculator. So, for simple problems such as finding the future
value of a single payment, it is generally easiest and quickest to use either the for-
mula approach or a financial calculator. However, for problems that involve several
cash flows, the formula approach usually is time-consuming, so either the calculator
or spreadsheet approach would generally be used. Calculators are portable and
quick to set up, but if many calculations of the same type must be done, or if you
want to see how changes in an input such as the interest rate affect the future value,
then the spreadsheet approach is generally more efficient. If the problem has many
irregular cash flows, or if you want to analyze alternative scenarios using different
cash flows or interest rates, then the spreadsheet approach definitely is the most ef-
ficient procedure.
Spreadsheets have two additional advantages over calculators. First, it is easier to
check the inputs with a spreadsheet—they are visible, whereas with a calculator they
are buried somewhere in the machine. Thus, you are less likely to make a mistake in
a complex problem when you use the spreadsheet approach. Second, with a spread-
sheet, you can make your analysis much more transparent than you can when using a
calculator. This is not necessarily important when all you want is the answer, but if
you need to present your calculations to others, like your boss, it helps to be able to
show intermediate steps, which enables someone to go through your exhibit and see
exactly what you did. Transparency is also important when you must go back, some-
time later, and reconstruct what you did.
You should understand the various approaches well enough to make a rational
choice, given the nature of the problem and the equipment you have available. In
any event, you must understand the concepts behind the calculations, and you must
also know how to set up time lines in order to work complex problems. This is true
for stock and bond valuation, capital budgeting, lease analysis, and many other im-
portant financial problems.
Chapter 4: Time Value of Money
131

Graphic View of the Compounding Process
Figure 4-2 shows how a $100 investment grows (or declines) over time at different in-
terest rates. Interest rates are normally positive, but the “growth” concept is broad
enough to include negative rates. We developed the curves by solving Equation 4-1
with different values for N and I. The interest rate is a growth rate: If money is depos-
ited and earns 5% per year, then your funds will grow by 5% per year. Note also that
time value concepts can be applied to anything that grows—sales, population, earnings
per share, or your future salary. Also, as noted before, the “growth rate” can be nega-
tive, as was sales growth for a number of auto companies in recent years.
Simple Interest versus Compound Interest
As explained earlier, when interest is earned on the interest earned in prior periods,
we call it compound interest. If interest is earned only on the principal, we call it
simple interest. The total interest earned with simple interest is equal to the princi-
pal multiplied by the interest rate times the number of periods: PV(I)(N). The future
value is equal to the principal plus the interest: FV = PV + PV(I)(N). For example,
suppose you deposit $100 for 3 years and earn simple interest at an annual rate of
5%. Your balance at the end of 3 years would be:
FV ¼ PV þ PVðIÞðNÞ
¼ $100 þ $100ð5%Þð3Þ
¼ $100 þ $15 ¼ $115
Notice that this is less than the $115.76 we calculated earlier using compound inter-
est. Most applications in finance are based on compound interest, but you should be
aware that simple interest is still specified in some legal documents.
Self-Test
Explain why this statement is true: “A dollar in hand today is worth more than a
dollar to be received next year, assuming interest rates are positive."
What is compounding? What would the future value of $100 be after 5 years at 10%
compound interest? ($161.05)
The Power of Compound Interest
Assume that you are 26 and just received your MBA.
After reading the introduction to this chapter, you de-
cide to start investing in the stock market for your retire-
ment. Your goal is to have $1 million when you retire at
age 65. Assuming you earn 10% annually on your stock
investments, how much must you invest at the end of
each year in order to reach your goal?
The answer is $2,491, but this amount depends criti-
cally on the return earned on your investments. If your
return drops to 8%, the required annual contribution
would rise to $4,185. On the other hand, if the return rises
to 12%, you would need to put away only $1,462 per year.
What if you are like most 26-year-olds and wait until
later to worry about retirement? If you wait until age 40,
you will need to save $10,168 per year to reach your $1
million goal, assuming you can earn 10%, but $13,679
per year if you earn only 8%. If you wait until age 50 and
then earn 8%, the required amount will be $36,830 per
year!
Although $1 million may seem like a lot of money, it
won’t be when you get ready to retire. If inflation
averages 5% a year over the next 39 years, then your
$1 million nest egg would be worth only $149,148 in
today’s dollars. If you live for 20 years after retirement
and earn a real 3% rate of return, your annual retire-
ment income in today’s dollars would be only $9,733
before taxes. So, after celebrating your graduation and
new job, start saving!

Suppose you currently have $2,000 and plan to purchase a 3-year certificate of deposit
(CD) that pays 4% interest, compounded annually. How much will you have when the CD
matures? ($2,249.73) How would your answer change if the interest rate were 5%, or 6%,
or 20%? (Hint: With a calculator, enter N = 3, I/YR = 4, PV = −2000, and PMT = 0; then press
FV to get 2,249.73. Then, enter I/YR = 5 to override the 4% and press FV again to get the
second answer. In general, you can change one input at a time to see how the output
changes.) ($2,315.25; $2,382.03; $3,456.00)

How much would $1, growing at 5% per year, be worth after 100 years? ($131.50)
What would FV be if the growth rate were 10%? ($13,780.61)
4.3 PRESENT VALUES
Suppose you have some extra money and want to make an investment. A broker offers
to sell you a bond that will pay a guaranteed $115.76 in 3 years. Banks are currently
offering a guaranteed 5% interest on 3-year certificates of deposit (CDs), and if you
don’t buy the bond you will buy a CD. The 5% rate paid on the CD is defined as
your opportunity cost, or the rate of return you would earn on an alternative invest-
ment of similar risk if you don’t invest in the security under consideration. Given these
conditions, what’s the most you should pay for the bond?
First, recall from the future value example in the last section that if you invested $100
at 5% in a CD, it would grow to $115.76 in 3 years. You would also have $115.76 after
3 years if you bought the bond. Therefore, the most you should pay for the bond is
$100—this is its “fair price,” which is also its intrinsic, or fundamental, value. If you

could buy the bond for less than $100, then you should buy it rather than invest in the
CD. Conversely, if its price were more than $100, you should buy the CD. If the bond’s
price were exactly $100, you should be indifferent between the bond and the CD.
The $100 is defined as the present value, or PV, of $115.76 due in 3 years when
the appropriate interest rate is 5%. In general, the present value of a cash flow due N
years in the future is the amount which, if it were on hand today, would grow to equal the
given future amount. Since $100 would grow to $115.76 in 3 years at a 5% interest
rate, $100 is the present value of $115.76 due in 3 years at a 5% rate.
Finding present values is called discounting, and as previously noted, it is the reverse
of compounding: If you know the PV, you can compound to find the FV; or if you know
the FV, you can discount to find the PV. Indeed, we simply solve Equation 4-1, the for-
mula for the future value, for the PV to produce the present value equation as follows.

Future value ¼ FVN ¼ PVð1 þ IÞN

The top section of Figure 4-3 shows inputs and a time line for finding the present
value of $115.76 discounted back for 3 years. We first calculate the PV using the step-
by-step approach. When we found the FV in the previous section, we worked from left
to right, multiplying the initial amount and each subsequent amount by (1 + I). To find

present values, we work backwards, or from right to left, dividing the future value and
each subsequent amount by (1 + I), with the present value of $100 shown in Cell D118.
The step-by-step procedure shows exactly what’s happening, and that can be quite useful
when you are working complex problems or trying to explain a model to others. How-
ever, it’s inefficient, especially if you are dealing with more than a year or two.
A more efficient procedure is to use the formula approach in Equation 4-3, simply
dividing the future value by (1 + I)N. This gives the same result, as we see in Figure 4-
3, Cell G120.
Equation 4-2 is actually programmed into financial calculators. As shown in
Figure 4-3, Rows 122 to 124, we can find the PV by entering values for N=3,
I/YR=5, PMT=0, and FV=115.76, and then pressing the PV key to get −100.
Excel also has a function that solves Equation 4-3—this is the PV function, and it
is written as =PV(I,N,0,FV).6 Cell E126 shows the inputs to this function. Next, Cell
E127 shows the Excel function with fixed numbers as inputs, with the actual function
and the resulting −$100 in Cell G127. Cell E128 shows the Excel function using cell
references, with the actual function and the resulting −$100 in Cell G128.
The fundamental goal of financial management is to maximize the firm’s intrinsic
value, and the intrinsic value of a business (or any asset, including stocks and bonds)
is the present value of its expected future cash flows. Because present value lies at the
heart of the valuation process, we will have much more to say about it in the remain-
der of this chapter and throughout the book.
Graphic View of the Discounting Process
Figure 4-4 shows that the present value of a sum to be received in the future decreases
and approaches zero as the payment date is extended further and further into the future;
it also shows that, the higher the interest rate, the faster the present value falls. At rela-
tively high rates, funds due in the future are worth very little today, and even at relatively

low rates present values of sums due in the very distant future are quite small. For exam-
ple, at a 20% discount rate, $1 million due in 100 years would be worth just over 1 cent
today. (However, 1 cent would grow to almost $1 million in 100 years at 20%.)

What is “discounting,” and how is it related to compounding? How is the future
value equation (4-1) related to the present value equation (4-3)?
How does the present value of a future payment change as the time to receipt is
lengthened? As the interest rate increases?
Suppose a risk-free bond promises to pay $2,249.73 in 3 years. If the going risk-free
interest rate is 4%, how much is the bond worth today? ($2,000) How would your answer
change if the bond matured in 5 rather than 3 years? ($1,849.11) If the risk-free interest
rate is 6% rather than 4%, how much is the 5-year bond worth today? ($1,681.13)
How much would $1 million due in 100 years be worth today if the discount rate
were 5%? ($7,604.49) What if the discount rate were 20%? ($0.0121)
4.4 FINDING THE INTEREST RATE, I
Thus far we have used Equations 4-1, 4-2, and 4-3 to find future and present values.
Those equations have four variables, and if we know three of them, then we (or our
calculator or Excel) can solve for the fourth. Thus, if we know PV, I, and N, we can
solve Equation 4-1 for FV, or if we know FV, I, and N, we can solve Equation 4-3 to
find PV. That’s what we did in the preceding two sections.
Now suppose we know PV, FV, and N, and we want to find I. For example, sup-
pose we know that a given security has a cost of $100 and that it will return $150
after 10 years. Thus, we know PV, FV, and N, and we want to find the rate of return
we will earn if we buy the security. Here’s the solution using Equation 4-1:
FV ¼ PVð1 þ IÞN
$150 ¼ $100ð1 þ IÞ10
$150=$100 ¼ ð1 þ IÞ10
ð1 þ IÞ10 ¼ 1:5
ð1 þ IÞ ¼ 1:5ð1=10Þ
1 þ I ¼ 1:0414
I ¼ 0:0414 ¼ 4:14%:
Finding the interest rate by solving the formula takes a little time and thought, but
financial calculators and spreadsheets find the answer almost instantly. Here’s the cal-
culator setup:

Inputs:
Enter N=10, PV= −100, PMT= 0 (because there are no payments until the security
matures), and FV=150. Then, when you press the I/YR key, the calculator gives
the answer, 4.14%. Notice that the PV is a negative value because it is a cash outflow
(an investment) and the FV is positive because it is a cash inflow (a return of the
investment). If you enter both PV and FV as positive numbers (or both as negative
numbers), you will get an error message rather than the answer.

Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

In Excel, the RATE function can be used to find the interest rate: =RATE(N,PMT,
PV,FV). For this example, the interest rate is found as =RATE(10,0,−100,150) = 0.0414
= 4.14%. See the file Ch04 Tool Kit.xls on the textbook’s Web site for an example.

4.5 FINDING THE NUMBER OF YEARS, N
We sometimes need to know how long it will take to accumulate a specific sum of money,
given our beginning funds and the rate we will earn. For example, suppose we now have
$500,000 and the interest rate is 4.5%. How long will it be before we have $1 million?
Here’s Equation 4-1, showing all the known variables.

4.6 ANNUITIES
Thus far we have dealt with single payments, or “lump sums.” However, assets such
as bonds provide a series of cash inflows over time, and obligations such as auto
loans, student loans, and mortgages call for a series of payments. If the payments
are equal and are made at fixed intervals, then we have an annuity. For example,
$100 paid at the end of each of the next 3 years is a 3-year annuity.
If payments occur at the end of each period, then we have an ordinary (or deferred)
annuity. Payments on mortgages, car loans, and student loans are generally made at the
ends of the periods and thus are ordinary annuities. If the payments are made at the be-
ginning of each period, then we have an annuity due. Rental lease payments, life insur-
ance premiums, and lottery payoffs (if you are lucky enough to win one!) are examples of
annuities due. Ordinary annuities are more common in finance, so when we use the term
“annuity” in this book, you may assume that the payments occur at the ends of the peri-
ods unless we state otherwise.
Next we show the time lines for a $100, 3-year, 5%, ordinary annuity and for the
same annuity on an annuity due basis. With the annuity due, each payment is shifted
back (to the left) by 1 year. In our example, we assume that a $100 payment will be
made each year, so we show the payments with minus signs.

As we demonstrate in the following sections, we can find an annuity’s future
value, present value, the interest rate built into the contracts, how long it takes to
reach a financial goal using the annuity, and, if we know all of those values, the size
of the annuity payment. Keep in mind that annuities must have constant payments
and a fixed number of periods. If these conditions don’t hold, then the series is not an
annuity.

What’s the difference between an ordinary annuity and an annuity due?
Why should you prefer to receive an annuity due with payments of $10,000 per year
for 10 years than an otherwise similar ordinary annuity?
4.7 FUTURE VALUE OF AN ORDINARY ANNUITY
Consider the ordinary annuity whose time line was shown previously, where you de-
posit $100 at the end of each year for 3 years and earn 5% per year. Figure 4-5 shows
how to calculate the future value of the annuity, FVAN, using the same approaches
we used for single cash flows.
As shown in the step-by-step section of Figure 4-5, we compound each payment
out to Time 3, then sum those compounded values in Cell F226 to find the annuity’s
FV, FVA3 = $315.25. The first payment earns interest for two periods, the second for
138
Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

one period, and the third earns no interest because it is made at the end of the annu-
ity’s life. This approach is straightforward, but if the annuity extends out for many
years, it is cumbersome and time-consuming.
As you can see from the time line diagram, with the step-by-step approach we
apply the following equation with N = 3 and I = 5%:
FVAN ¼ PMTð1 þ IÞN−1 þ PMTð1 þ IÞN−2 þ PMTð1 þ IÞN−3
¼ $100ð1:05Þ2 þ $100ð1:05Þ1 þ $100ð1:05Þ0
¼ $315:25
For the general case, the future value of an annuity is
FVAN ¼ PMTð1 þ IÞN−1 þ PMTð1 þ IÞN−2 þ PMTð1 þ IÞN−3 þ … þ PMTð1 þ IÞ0
As shown in Web Extension 4B on the textbook’s Web site, the future value of an
annuity can be written as follows:9

9Section 4.11 shows that the present value of an infinitely long annuity, called a perpetuity, is equal to
PMT/I. The cash flows of an ordinary annuity of N periods are equal to the cash flows of a perpetuity
minus the cash flows of a perpetuity that begins at year N+1. Therefore, the future value of an N-period
annuity is equal to the future value (as of year N) of a perpetuity minus the value (as of year N) of a per-
petuity that begins at year N+1. See Web Extension 4B on the textbook’s Web site for details regarding
derivations of Equation 4-4.

The procedure when dealing with annuities is similar to what we have done thus far

We enter PV = 0 because we start off with nothing, and we enter PMT = –100 because
we will deposit this amount in the account at the end of each of the 3 years. The interest
rate is 5%, and when we press the FV key we get the answer, FVA3 = 315.25.
Since this is an ordinary annuity, with payments coming at the end of each year, we must
set the calculator appropriately. As noted earlier, most calculators “come out of the box” set
to assume that payments occur at the end of each period—that is, to deal with ordinary
annuities. However, there is a key that enables us to switch between ordinary annuities
and annuities due. For ordinary annuities, the designation “End Mode” or something sim-
ilar is used, while for annuities due the designator is “Begin,” “Begin Mode,” “Due,” or
something similar. If you make a mistake and set your calculator on Begin Mode when
working with an ordinary annuity, then each payment will earn interest for one extra
year, which will cause the compounded amounts, and thus the FVA, to be too large.
The spreadsheet approach uses Excel’s FV function, =FV(I,N,PMT,PV). In our
example, we have =FV(0.05,3,−100,0), and the result is again $315.25.

4.8 FUTURE VALUE OF AN ANNUITY DUE
Because each payment occurs one period earlier with an annuity due, the payments
will all earn interest for one additional period. Therefore, the FV of an annuity due
will be greater than that of a similar ordinary annuity.
If you went through the step-by-step procedure, you would see that our illustra-
tive annuity due has a FV of $331.01 versus $315.25 for the ordinary annuity.
See Ch04 Tool Kit.xls on the textbook’s Web site for a summary of future value
calculations.
With the formula approach, we first use Equation 4-4, but since each payment oc-
curs one period earlier, we multiply the Equation 4-4 result by (1 + I):
FVAdue ¼ FVAordinaryð1 þ IÞ
(4-6)
Thus, for the annuity due, FVAdue = $315.25(1.05) = $331.01, which is the same re-
sult as found with the step-by-step approach.
With a calculator we input the variables just as we did with the ordinary annuity,
but we now set the calculator to Begin Mode to get the answer, $331.01.

nary annuity. For an annuity due, Type = 1. As shown in Ch04 Tool Kit.xls, the

Present Value of Annuities Due
Because each payment for an annuity due occurs one period earlier, the payments
will all be discounted for one less period. Therefore, the PV of an annuity due must
be greater than that of a similar ordinary annuity.
If you went through the step-by-step procedure, you would see that our illustra-
tive annuity due has a PV of $285.94 versus $272.32 for the ordinary annuity. See

4.10 FINDING ANNUITY PAYMENTS, PERIODS,
AND INTEREST RATES
In the three preceding sections we discussed how to find the FV and PV of ordi-
nary annuities and annuities due, using these four methods: step-by-step, formula,
financial calculator, and Excel. Five variables are involved—N, I, PMT, FV, and
PV—and if you know any four, you can find the fifth by solving either 4-4 (4-6 for
annuities due) or 4-7 (4-8 for annuities due). However, a trial-and-error procedure is
generally required to find N or I, and that can be quite tedious. Therefore, we dis-
cuss only the financial calculator and spreadsheet approaches for finding N and I.
Finding Annuity Payments, PMT
We need to accumulate $10,000 and have it available 5 years from now. We
can earn 6% on our money. Thus, we know that FV = 10,000, PV = 0, N = 5,
and I/YR = 6. We can enter these values in a financial calculator and then press
the PMT key to find our required deposits. However, the answer depends on
whether we make deposits at the end of each year (ordinary annuity) or at the
beginning (annuity due), so the mode must be set properly. Here are the results
for each type of annuity:
Variable Annuities: Good or Bad?
Retirees appreciate stable, predictable income, so they of-
ten buy annuities. Insurance companies have been the
traditional suppliers, using the payments they receive to
buy high-grade bonds, whose interest is then used to
make the promised payments. Such annuities were quite
safe and stable and provided returns of around 7.5%.
However, returns on stocks (dividends plus capital gains)
have historically exceeded bonds’ returns (interest).
Therefore, some insurance companies in the 1990s began
to offer variable annuities, which were backed by stocks
instead of bonds. If stocks earned in the future as much as
they had in the past, then variable annuities could offer
returns of about 9%, better than the return on a fixed
rate annuities. If stock returns turned out to be lower in
the future than they had been in the past (or even had
negative returns), then the variable annuities promised a
guaranteed minimum payment of about 6.5%. Variable
annuities appealed to many retirees, so companies that
offered them had a significant competitive advantage.
The insurance company that pioneered variable an-
nuities, The Hartford, tried to hedge its position with de-
rivatives that paid off if stocks went down. But like so
many other derivatives-based risk management pro-
grams, this one went awry in 2008 because stock losses
exceeded the assumed worst-case scenario. The Hart-
ford, which was founded in 1810 and was one of the
oldest and largest U.S. insurance companies at the be-
ginning of 2008, saw its stock fall from $85.54 to $4.16.
Because of the general stock market crash, investors
feared that The Hartford would be unable to make
good on its variable annuity promises, which would
lead to bankruptcy. The company was bailed out by
the economic stimulus package, but this 199-year-old
firm will never be the same again.

Thus, you must put away $1,773.96 per year if you make payments at the end of each
year, but only $1,673.55 if the payments begin immediately. Finally, note that
the required payment for the annuity due is the ordinary annuity payment divided
by (1 + I): $1,773.96/1.06 = $1,673.55.
Excel can also be used to find annuity payments, as shown below for the two types of
annuities. For end-of-year (ordinary) annuities, “Type” can be left blank or a 0 can be
inserted. For beginning-of-year annuities (annuities due), the same function is used
but now Type is designated as 1. Here is the setup for the two types of annuities.

With Excel, you can use the NPER function: =NPER(I,PMT,PV,FV, Type).
For our ordinary annuity example, Type is left blank (or 0 is inserted) and the function
is =NPER(0.06,−1200,0,10000) = 6.96. If we put in 1 for type, we would find N = 6.63.

Thus, you would need to earn a whopping 25.78%! About the only way to earn such
a high return would be either to invest in speculative stocks or head to a Las Vegas
casino. Of course, speculative stocks and gambling aren’t like making deposits in a
bank with a guaranteed rate of return, so there would be a high probability that
you’d end up with nothing. So, you should probably save more, lower your $10,000
target, or extend your time horizon. It might be appropriate to seek a somewhat
higher return, but trying to earn 25.78% in a 6% market would involve speculation,
not investing.
In Excel, you can use the RATE function: =RATE(N,PMT,PV,FV,Type). For
our example, the function is =RATE(5,−1200,0,10000) = 0.2578 = 25.78%. If you
decide to make the payments beginning immediately then the required rate of return
would decline sharply, to 17.54%.

4.11 PERPETUITIES
In the previous section we dealt with annuities whose payments continue for a spe-
cific number of periods—for example, $100 per year for 10 years. However, some
securities promise to make payments forever. For example, in the mid-1700s the
British government issued some bonds that never matured and whose proceeds were
used to pay off other British bonds. Since this action consolidated the government’s
debt, the new bonds were called “consols.” The term stuck, and now any bond that
promises to pay interest perpetually is called a consol, or a perpetuity. The interest
rate on the consols was 2.5%, so a consol with a face value of $1,000 would pay $25
per year in perpetuity.11
11The consols actually pay interest in pounds, but we discuss them in dollar terms for simplicity.
146
Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

A consol, or perpetuity, is simply an annuity whose promised payments extend
out forever. Since the payments go on forever, you can’t apply the step-by-step
approach. However, it’s easy to find the PV of a perpetuity with the following
formula:12
PV of a perpetuity ¼ PMT
I
(4-9)
We can use Equation 4-9 to find the value of a British consol with a face value of
$1,000 that pays $25 per year in perpetuity. The answer depends on the interest
rate being earned on investments of comparable risk at the time the consol is being
valued. Originally, the “going rate” as established in the financial marketplace was
2.5%, so originally the consol’s value was $1,000:
Consol's valueOriginally ¼ $25=0:025 ¼ $1; 000
The annual payment is still $25 today, but the going interest rate has risen to about
5.2%, causing the consol’s value to fall to $480.77:
Consol's valueToday ¼ $25=0:052 ¼ $480:77
Note, though, that if interest rates decline in the future, say to 2%, then the value of
the consol will rise to $1,250.00:
Consol's value if rates decline to 2% ¼ $25=0:02 ¼ $1; 250:00
These examples demonstrate an important point: When interest rates change, the
prices of outstanding bonds also change, but inversely to the change in rates. Thus, bond prices
decline if rates rise, and prices increase if rates fall. This holds for all bonds, both consols
and those with finite maturities. We will discuss this point in more detail in Chapter 5,
where we cover bonds in depth.

Using the Internet for Personal Financial Planning
People continually face important financial decisions
that require an understanding of the time value of
money. Should we buy or lease a car? How much and
how soon should we begin to save for our children’s ed-
ucation? How expensive a house can we afford? Should
we refinance our home mortgage? How much must we
save each year if we are to retire comfortably?
The answers to these questions are often compli-
cated, and they depend on a number of factors, such
as projected housing and education costs, interest
rates, inflation, expected family income, and stock mar-
ket returns. Hopefully, after completing this chapter,
you will have a better idea of how to answer such ques-
tions. Note, though, that a number of online resources
are available to help with financial planning. A good
place to start is http://www.smartmoney.com. Smart-
money is a personal finance magazine produced by
the publishers of The Wall Street Journal. If you go to
Smartmoney’s Web site you will find a section entitled
“Tools.” This section has a number of financial calcula-
tors, spreadsheets, and descriptive materials that cover
a wide range of personal finance issues.

Do bond prices move directly or inversely with interest rates—that is, what happens
to the value of a bond if interest rates increase or decrease?
4.12 UNEVEN, OR IRREGULAR, CASH FLOWS
The definition of an annuity includes the term constant payment—in other words, an-
nuities involve a set of identical payments over a given number of periods. Although
many financial decisions do involve constant payments, many others involve cash
flows that are uneven or irregular. For example, the dividends on common stocks
are typically expected to increase over time, and investments in capital equipment al-
most always generate cash flows that vary from year to year. Throughout the book,
we use the term payment (PMT) in situations where the cash flows are constant and
thus an annuity is involved; we use the term cash flow (CFt), where the t designates
the period in which the particular cash flow occurs, if the cash flows are irregular.
There are two important classes of uneven cash flows: (1) those in which the cash
flow stream consists of a series of annuity payments plus an additional final lump sum
in Year N, and (2) all other uneven streams. Bonds are an instance of the first type, while
stocks and capital investments illustrate the second type. Here’s an example of each type.

Annuity Plus Additional Final Payment
First, consider Stream 1 and notice that it is a 5-year, 12%, ordinary annuity plus a
final payment of $1,000. We can find the PV of the annuity, find the PV of the final
payment, and then sum them to get the PV of the stream. Financial calculators are
programmed do this for us—we use all five time value of money (TVM) keys, enter-
ing the data for the four known values as shown below, and then pressing the PV key
to get the answer, $927.90:

Similarly, we could use Excel’s PV function, =PV(I,N,PMT,FV) = PV(0.12,5,100,1000)
= −$927.90. Note that the process is similar to that for annuities, except we now have a
nonzero value for FV.
Irregular Cash Flow Stream
Now consider the irregular stream, which is analyzed in Figure 4-7. The top section
shows the basic time line, which contains the inputs, and we first use the step-by-step
approach to find PV = $1,016.35. Note that we show the PV of each cash flow di-
rectly below the cash flow, and then we sum these PVs to find the PV of the stream.
This setup saves space as compared with showing the individual PVs in a column,
and it is also transparent and thus easy to understand.
Now consider the financial calculator approach. The cash flows don’t form an
annuity, so you can’t use the annuity feature on the calculator. You could, of
course, use the calculator in the step-by-step procedure, but financial calculators
have a feature—the cash flow register—that allows you to find the present
value more efficiently. First, you input the individual cash flows, in chronological

Here we put the PVs of each individual CF under the CF itself and then summed them to find the PV of
the entire stream, rather than show them all in Column C as was done in Figure 4-6.  This setup takes
up less space and also makes the calculations quite transparent, which is useful, especially when the
table must be explained to people who did not develop it. People appreciate transparency and clarity.

Our Excel formula ignores the initial cash flow (in Year 0).  When entering a cash flow range, Excel
assumes that the first value occurs at the end of the first year.  As we will see later, if there is an initial
cash flow, it must be added seperately to complete the NPV formula result.  Notice too that you can
enter cash flows one-by-one, but if the cash flows appear in consecutive cells, you can enter the cell

order, into the cash flow register.13 Cash flows are designated CF0, CF1, CF2,
CF3,…, CFN. Next, you enter the interest rate, I. At this point, you have substi-
tuted in all the known values of Equation 4-10, so when you press the NPV key
you get the PV of the stream. The calculator finds the PV of each cash flow and
sums them to find the PV of the entire stream. To input the cash flows for this
problem, enter 0 (because CF0 = 0), 100, 300, 300, 300, and 500 in that order
into the cash flow register, enter I=12, and then press NPV to obtain the answer,
$1,016.35.
Two points should be noted. First, when dealing with the cash flow register, the
calculator uses the term “NPV” rather than “PV.” The N stands for “net,” so NPV
is the abbreviation for “net present value,” which is simply the net present value of a
series of positive and negative cash flows, including any cash flow at time zero. The
NPV function will be used extensively when we get to capital budgeting, where CF0
is generally the cost of the project.
The second point to note is that repeated cash flows with identical values
can be entered into the cash flow register more efficiently by using the Nj key.
In this illustration, you would enter CF0=0, CF1=100, CF2=300, Nj=3 (which tells
the calculator that the 300 occurs 3 times), and CF5=500.14 Then enter I=12, press
the NPV key, and 1,016.35 will appear in the display. Also, note that numbers en-
tered into the cash flow register remain in the register until they are cleared. Thus,
if you previously worked a problem with eight cash flows, then moved to one with
only four cash flows, the calculator would simply add the cash flows from the second
problem to those of the first problem, and you would get an incorrect answer.
Therefore, you must be sure to clear the cash flow register before starting a new
problem.
Spreadsheets are especially useful for solving problems with uneven cash
flows. You enter the cash flows in the spreadsheet as shown in Figure 4-7 on
Row 474. To find the PV of these cash flows without going through the step-
by-step process, you would use the NPV function. First put the cursor on the
cell where you want the answer to appear, Cell G486, click Financial, scroll
down to NPV, and click OK to get the dialog box. Then enter C471 (or 0.12)
for Rate and enter either the individual cash flows or the range of cells contain-
ing the cash flows, C474:G474, for Value 1. Be very careful when entering
the range of cash flows. With a financial calculator, you begin by entering the
Time-0 cash flow. With Excel, you do not include the Time-0 cash flow; instead,
you begin with the Year-1 cash flow. Now, when you click OK, you get the PV
of the stream, $1,016.35. Note that you can use the PV function if the payments
are constant, but you must use the NPV function if the cash flows are not con-
stant. Finally, note that Excel has a major advantage over financial calculators in
that you can see the cash flows, which makes it easy to spot data entry errors.
With a calculator, the numbers are buried in the machine, making it harder to
check your work.
13We cover the calculator mechanics in the tutorial, and we discuss the process in more detail in Chapter
10, where we use the NPV calculation to analyze proposed projects. If you don’t know how to use the
cash flow register of your calculator, you should to go to our tutorial or your calculator manual, learn
the steps, and be sure you can make this calculation. You will have to know how to do it eventually, and
now is a good time to learn.
14On some calculators, instead of entering CF5 = 500, you enter CF3 = 500, because this is the next cash
flow different from 300.

Would a “typical” common stock provide cash flows more like an annuity or more
like an uneven cash flow stream?
4.13 FUTURE VALUE OF AN UNEVEN CASH FLOW STREAM
The future value of an uneven cash flow stream (sometimes called the terminal, or
horizon, value) is found by compounding each payment to the end of the stream
and then summing the future values:

¼ ∑
N

(4-11)
The future value of our illustrative uneven cash flow stream is $1,791.15, as shown in
Figure 4-8.
Most financial calculators have a net future value (NFV) key which, after the cash
flows and interest rate have been entered, can be used to obtain the future value of an
uneven cash flow stream. If your calculator doesn’t have the NFV feature, you
can first find the net present value of the stream, then find its net future value as
NFV = NPV(1 + I)N. In the illustrative problem, we find PV = 1,016.35 using the
cash flow register and I=12. Then we use the TVM register, entering N=5, I=12,
PV = −1016.35, and PMT = 0. When we press FV, we find FV = 1,791.15, which is

4.14 SOLVING FOR I WITH IRREGULAR CASH FLOWS
Before financial calculators and spreadsheets existed, it was extremely difficult to find I if the
cash flows were uneven. However, with spreadsheets and financial calculators it’s easy to
find I. If you have an annuity plus a final lump sum, you can input values for N, PV, PMT,
and FV into the calculator’s TVM registers and then press the I/YR key. Here’s the setup

The rate of return on the $927.90 investment is 12%.
Finding the interest rate for an irregular cash flow stream with a calculator is a bit
more complicated. Figure 4-9 shows Stream 2 from Section 4.12, assuming a re-
quired investment of CF0 = −$1,000. First, note that there is no simple step-by-step
method for finding the rate of return—finding the rate for this investment requires a
trial-and-error process, which is terribly time consuming. Therefore, we really need a
financial calculator or a spreadsheet. With a calculator, we would enter the CFs into
the cash flow register and then press the IRR key to get the answer. IRR stands for
“internal rate of return,” and it is the rate of return the investment provides. The
investment is the cash flow at Time 0, and it must be entered as a negative number.
When we enter those cash flows in the calculator’s cash flow register and press the
IRR key, we get the rate of return on the $1,000 investment, 12.55%. Finally, note
that once you have entered the cash flows in the calculator’s register, you can find
both the investment’s net present value (NPV) and its internal rate of return. For
investment decisions, we typically want both of these numbers. Therefore, we gener-
ally enter the data once and then find both the NPV and the IRR.
You would get the same answer using Excel’s IRR function, as shown in Figure 4-9.
Notice that when using the IRR—unlike using the NPV function—you must include
all cash flows, including the Time-0 cash flow.

4.15 SEMIANNUAL AND OTHER COMPOUNDING PERIODS
In most of our examples thus far, we assumed that interest is compounded once a year,
or annually. This is annual compounding. Suppose, however, that you put $1,000 into
a bank that pays a 6% annual interest rate but credits interest each 6 months. This is
semiannual compounding. If you leave your funds in the account, how much would
you have at the end of 1 year under semiannual compounding? Note that you will re-
ceive $60 of interest for the year, but you will receive $30 of it after only 6 months and
the other $30 at the end of the year. You will earn interest on the first $30 during the
second 6 months, so you will end the year with more than the $60 you would have had
under annual compounding. You would be even better off under quarterly, monthly,
weekly, or daily compounding. Note also that virtually all bonds pay interest semiannu-
ally; most stocks pay dividends quarterly; most mortgages, student loans, and auto loans
involve monthly payments; and most money fund accounts pay interest daily. Therefore,
it is essential that you understand how to deal with nonannual compounding.
Types of Interest Rates
When we move beyond annual compounding, we must deal with the following four
types of interest rates:
•
Nominal annual rates, given the symbol INOM
•
Annual percentage rates, termed APR rates
•
Periodic rates, denoted as IPER
•
Effective annual rates, given the symbol EAR or EFF%
Nominal (or Quoted) Rate, INOM.15
This is the rate quoted by banks, brokers,
and other financial institutions. So, if you talk with a banker, broker, mortgage
lender, auto finance company, or student loan officer about rates, the nominal rate
is the one he or she will normally quote you. However, to be meaningful, the quoted
nominal rate must also include the number of compounding periods per year. For
example, a bank might offer you a CD at 6% compounded daily, while a credit union
might offer 6.1% compounded monthly.
Note that the nominal rate is never shown on a time line, and it is never used as an input
in a financial calculator (except when compounding occurs only once a year). If more
frequent compounding occurs, you must use periodic rates.
Periodic Rate, IPER.
This is the rate charged by a lender or paid by a borrower each
period. It can be a rate per year, per 6 months (semiannually), per quarter, per month, per
day, or per any other time interval. For example, a bank might charge 1.5% per month on
15The term nominal rate as it is used here has a different meaning than the way it was used in Chapter 1.
There, nominal interest rates referred to stated market rates as opposed to real (zero-inflation) rates. In
this chapter, the term nominal rate means the stated, or quoted, annual rate as opposed to the effective an-
nual rate, which we explain later. In both cases, though, nominal means stated, or quoted, as opposed to
some sort of adjusted rate.

its credit card loans, or a finance company might charge 3% per quarter on installment
loans.
We find the periodic rate as follows:
Periodic rate IPER = INOM/M
(4-12)
where INOM is the nominal annual rate and M is the number of compounding periods per
year. Thus, a 6% nominal rate with semiannual payments results in a periodic rate of
Periodic rate IPER = 6%/2 = 3.00%.
If only one payment is made per year then M = 1, in which case the periodic rate
would equal the nominal rate: 6%/1 = 6%.
The periodic rate is the rate shown on time lines and used in calculations.16 To illustrate,
suppose you invest $100 in an account that pays a nominal rate of 12%, compounded
quarterly, or 3% per period. How much would you have after 2 years if you leave the
funds on deposit? First, here is the time line for the problem:

16The only exception is in cases where (1) annuities are involved and (2) the payment periods do not cor-
respond to the compounding periods. In such cases—for example, if you are making quarterly payments
into a bank account to build up a specified future sum but the bank pays interest on a daily basis—then
the calculations are more complicated. For such problems, the simplest procedure is to determine the pe-
riodic (daily) interest rate by dividing the nominal rate by 365 (or by 360 if the bank uses a 360-day year),
then compound each payment over the exact number of days from the payment date to the terminal
point, and then sum the compounded payments to find the future value of the annuity. This is what is
generally done in the real world, because with a computer it’s a simple process.
17Most financial calculators have a feature that allows you to set the number of payments per year and
then use the nominal annual interest rate. However, students tend to make fewer errors when using the
periodic rate with their calculators set for one payment per year (i.e., per period), so this is what we rec-
ommend. Note also that a normal time line cannot be used unless you use the periodic rate.

Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

Effective (or Equivalent) Annual Rate (EAR or EFF%).
This is the annual
(interest once a year) rate that produces the same final result as compounding at the
periodic rate for M times per year. The EAR, also called EFF% (for effective per-
centage rate), is found as follows:18
EAR ¼ EFF% ¼
1 þ INOM
M

M
−1:0
(4-14)
Here INOM/M is the periodic rate and M is the number of periods per year. If a bank
would lend you money at a nominal rate of 12%, compounded quarterly, then the
EFF% rate would be 12.5509%:
Rate on bank loan: EFF% ¼ ð1 þ 0:03Þ4−1:0 ¼ ð1:03Þ4−1:0
¼ 1:125509−1:0 ¼ 0:125509 ¼ 12:5509%
To see the importance of the EFF%, suppose that—as an alternative to the bank loan—
you could borrow on a credit card that charges 1% per month. Would you be better off
using the bank loan or credit card loan? To answer this question, the cost of each alternative
must be expressed as an EFF%. We just saw that the bank loan’s effective cost is 12.5509%.
The cost of the credit card loan, with monthly payments, is slightly higher, 12.6825%:
Credit card loan: EFF% ¼ ð1 þ 0:01Þ12−1:0 ¼ ð1:01Þ12−1:0
¼ 1:126825−1:0 ¼ 0:126825 ¼ 12:6825%
This result is logical: Both loans have the same 12% nominal rate, yet you would have
to make the first payment after only one month on the credit card versus three
months under the bank loan.
The EFF% rate is rarely used in calculations. However, it must be used to compare
the effective costs of different loans or rates of return on different investments when payment
periods differ, as in our example of the credit card versus a bank loan.
The Result of Frequent Compounding
What would happen to the future value of an investment if interest were com-
pounded annually, semiannually, quarterly, or some other less-than-annual period?
Because interest will be earned on interest more often, you should expect higher future
values the more frequently compounding occurs. Similarly, you should expect the ef-
fective annual rate to increase with more frequent compounding. As Figure 4-10
shows, these results do occur—the future value and the EFF% do increase as the
frequency of compounding increases. Notice that the biggest increase in FV (and in
EFF%) occurs when compounding goes from annual to semiannual, and notice also
that moving from monthly to daily compounding has a relatively small impact.
Although Figure 4-10 shows daily compounding as the smallest interval, it is possible
to compound even more frequently. At the limit, compounding can occur continu-
ously. This is explained in Web Extension 4C on the textbook’s Web site.
18You could also use the “interest conversion feature” of a financial calculator. Most financial calculators
are programmed to find the EFF% or, given the EFF%, to find the nominal rate; this is called “interest
rate conversion.” You enter the nominal rate and the number of compounding periods per year, then
press the EFF% key to find the effective annual rate. However, we generally use Equation 4-14 because
it’s easy and because using the equation reminds us of what we are really doing. If you do use the interest
rate conversion feature on your calculator, don’t forget to reset your settings afterward. Interest conver-
sion is discussed in our calculator tutorials.

Would you rather invest in an account that pays a 7% nominal rate with annual
compounding or with monthly compounding? If you borrowed at a nominal rate of
7%, would you rather make annual or rather monthly payments? Why?
What is the future value of $100 after 3 years if the appropriate interest rate is 8%,
compounded annually? ($125.97) Compounded monthly? ($127.02)
What is the present value of $100 due in 3 years if the appropriate interest rate is 8%,
compounded annually? ($79.38) Compounded monthly? ($78.73)
Define the following terms: “annual percentage rate, or APR”; “effective annual rate,
or EFF%”; and “nominal interest rate, INOM.“
A bank pays 5% with daily compounding on its savings accounts. Should it advertise
the nominal or effective rate if it is seeking to attract new deposits?
Credit card issuers must by law print their annual percentage rate on their monthly
statements. A common APR is 18%, with interest paid monthly. What is the EFF% on
such a loan? (19.56%)
FIGURE 4-10
Effect on $100 of Compounding More Frequently Than Once a Year
Truth in Lending: What Loans Really Cost
Congress passed the Consumer Credit Protection Act in
1968. The Truth in Lending provisions in the Act require
banks and other lenders to disclose the annual percent-
age rate (APR) they are charging. For example, suppose
you plan to buy a fancy TV set that costs $3,000, and the
store offers you credit for one year at an “add-on” quoted
rate of 8%. Here we first find the total dollars of interest by
multiplying the $3,000 you are borrowing times 8%, get-
ting $240. This interest is then added to the $3,000 cost of
the TV, resulting in a total loan of $3,240. The total loan is
divided by 12 to get the monthly payments: $3,240/12 =
$270 per month, with the first payment made at the time
of purchase. Therefore, we have a 12-month annuity due
with payments of $270. Is your cost really the 8% that you
were quoted?
To find the APR, you first set your calculator to Begin
Mode, then enter N = 12, PV = 3000, PMT = –270, and
FV = 0. Then, when you press the I/YR key, you get the
periodic rate, 1.4313%. You then multiply by 12 to get the
APR, 17.1758%. You could also find the EFF%, which is
18.5945%. We show these calculations using both the cal-
culator and Excel, along with a time line that helps us visu-
alize what’s happening, in the chapter’s Excel Tool Kit.
The 17.1758% APR that the dealer is required to report
is a much better indicator of the loan’s cost than the 8%
nominal rate, but it still does not reflect the true cost,
which is the 18.5945% effective annual rate. Thus, buying
the TV on time would really cost you 18.5945%. If you
don’t know what’s happening when you buy on time or
borrow, you may pay a lot more than you think!

Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

Some years ago banks weren’t required to reveal the rate they charged on credit
cards. Then Congress passed a “truth in lending” law that required them to publish
their APR rate. Is the APR rate really the “most truthful” rate, or would the EFF% be
even “more truthful”?
4.16 FRACTIONAL TIME PERIODS19
Thus far we have assumed that payments occur at either the beginning or the end of periods,
but not within periods. However, we occasionally encounter situations that require com-
pounding or discounting over fractional periods. For example, suppose you deposited $100
in a bank that pays a nominal rate of 10%, compounded daily, based on a 365-day year. How
much would you have after 9 months? The answer of $107.79 is found as follows:20
Periodic rate ¼ IPER ¼ 0:10=365 ¼ 0:000273973 per day
Number of days ¼ ð9=12Þð365Þ ¼ 0:75ð365Þ
¼ 273:75 days; rounded to 274
Ending amount ¼ $100ð1:000273973Þ274 ¼ $107:79
Now suppose that instead you borrow $100 at a nominal rate of 10% per year,
simple interest, which means that interest is not earned on interest. If the loan is out-
standing for 274 days (or 9 months), how much interest would you have to pay? The
interest owed is equal to the principal multiplied by the interest rate times the num-
ber of periods. In this case, the number of periods is equal to a fraction of a year:
N = 274/365 = 0.7506849.
Interest owed = $100(10%)(0.7506849) = $7.51
Another approach would be to use the daily rate rather than the annual rate and
thus to use the exact number of days rather than the fraction of the year:
Interest owed = $100(0.000273973)(274) = $7.51
You would owe the bank a total of $107.51 after 274 days. This is the procedure most
banks actually use to calculate interest on loans, except that they generally require bor-
rowers to pay the interest on a monthly basis rather than after 274 days; this more fre-
quent compounding raises the EFF% and thus the total amount of interest paid.
Self-Test
Suppose a company borrowed $1 million at a rate of 9%, simple interest, with inter-
est paid at the end of each month. The bank uses a 360-day year. How much interest
would the firm have to pay in a 30-day month? ($7,500.00) What would the interest
be if the bank used a 365-day year? ($7,397.26)
Suppose you deposited $1,000 in a credit union that pays 7% with daily compound-
ing and a 365-day year. What is the EFF%? (7.250098%) How much could you with-
draw after 7 months, assuming this is 7/12 of a year? ($1,041.67)
19This section is interesting and useful, but relatively technical. It can be omitted, at the option of the in-
structor, without loss of continuity.
20We assume that these 9 months constitute 9/12 of a year. Also, bank deposit and loan contracts specifi-
cally state whether they are based on a 360-day or a 365-day year. If a 360-day year is used, then the daily
rate is higher, so the effective rate is also higher. Here we assumed a 365-day year. Finally, note that
banks’ computers, like Excel, have built-in calendars, so they can calculate the exact number of days.
Note also that banks often treat such loans as follows. (1) They require monthly payments, and they
figure the interest for the month as the periodic rate multiplied by the beginning-of-month balance times
the number of days in the month. This is called “simple interest.” (2) The interest for the month is either
added to the next beginning of month balance, or else the borrower must actually pay the earned interest.
In this case, the EFF% is based on 12 compounding periods, not 365 as is assumed in our example.

4.17 AMORTIZED LOANS
An extremely important application of compound interest involves loans that are paid
off in installments over time. Included are automobile loans, home mortgage loans,
student loans, and many business loans. A loan that is to be repaid in equal amounts
on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis is called an amortized loan.21 For example,
suppose a company borrows $100,000, with the loan to be repaid in 5 equal payments
at the end of each of the next 5 years. The lender charges 6% on the balance at the
beginning of each year.
Here’s a picture of the situation:

$23,739.64 per year for the next 5 years.
Each payment will consist of two parts—part interest and part repayment of prin-
cipal. This breakdown is shown in the amortization schedule given in Figure 4-11.
The interest component is relatively high in the first year, but it declines as the loan
balance decreases. For tax purposes, the borrower would deduct the interest compo-
nent while the lender would report the same amount as taxable income. Over the 5
years, the lender will earn 6% on its investment and also recover the amount of its
investment.

Consider again the example in Figure 4-11. If the loan were amortized over 5 years
with 60 equal monthly payments, how much would each payment be, and how
would the first payment be divided between interest and principal? (Each payment
would be $1,933.28; the first payment would have $500 of interest and $1,433.28 of
principal repayment.)
Suppose you borrowed $30,000 on a student loan at a rate of 8% and now must
repay it in three equal installments at the end of each of the next 3 years. How
large would your payments be, how much of the first payment would represent

after the first year? (PMT = $11,641.01; interest = $2,400; principal = $9,241.01; bal-
ance at end of Year 1 = $20,758.99)
4.18 GROWING ANNUITIES22
Normally, an annuity is defined as a series of constant payments to be received over a
specified number of periods. However, the term growing annuity is used to describe
a series of payments that grow at a constant rate.
Example 1: Finding a Constant Real Income
Growing annuities are often used in the area of financial planning, where a prospec-
tive retiree wants to determine the maximum constant real, or inflation-adjusted, with-
drawals that he or she can make over a specified number of years. For example,
suppose a 65-year-old is contemplating retirement, expects to live for another 20
years, has a $1 million nest egg, expects the investments to earn a nominal annual
rate of 6%, expects inflation to average 3% per year, and wants to withdraw a con-
stant real amount annually over the next 20 years so as to maintain a constant stan-
dard of living. If the first withdrawal is to be made today, what is the amount of that
initial withdrawal?
This problem can be solved in three ways. (1) Set up a spreadsheet model that is
similar to an amortization table, where the account earns 6% per year, withdrawals
rise at the 3% inflation rate, and Excel’s Goal Seek function is used to find the initial
inflation-adjusted withdrawal. A zero balance will be shown at the end of the twenti-
eth year. (2) Use a financial calculator, where we first calculate the real rate of return,

We will focus on the first two approaches.
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
An Accident Waiting to Happen: Option Reset Adjustable Rate Mortgages
Option reset adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) give the
borrower some choices regarding the initial monthly
payment. One popular option ARM allowed borrowers
to make a monthly payment equal to only half of the
interest due in the first month. Because the monthly
payment was less than the interest charge, the loan bal-
ance grew each month. When the loan balance ex-
ceeded 110% of the original principal, the monthly
payment was reset to fully amortize the now-larger
loan at the prevailing market interest rates.
Here’s an example. Someone borrows $325,000 for
30 years at an initial rate of 7%. The interest accruing in
the first month is (7%/12)($325,000) = $1,895.83. There-
fore, the initial monthly payment is 50%($1,895.83) =
$947.92. Another $947.92 of deferred interest is added
to the loan balance, taking it up to $325,000 + $947.92 =
$325,947.82. Because the loan is now larger, interest in
the second month is higher, and both interest and the
loan balance will continue to rise each month. The first
month after the loan balance exceeds 110%($325,000) =
$357,500, the contract calls for the payment to be reset
so as to fully amortize the loan at the then-prevailing
interest rate.
First, how long would it take for the balance to
exceed $357,500?
Consider
this
from
the
lender’s
perspective: the lender initially pays out $325,000, re-
ceives $947.92 each month, and then would receive a
payment of $357,500 if the loan were payable when
the balance hit that amount, with interest accruing at a
7% annual rate and with monthly compounding. We
enter these values into a financial calculator: I = 7%/12,
PV = −325000, PMT = 947.92, and FV = 357500. We solve
for N = 31.3 months, rounded up to 32 months. Thus,
the borrower will make 32 payments of $947.92 before
the ARM resets.
The payment after the reset depends upon the terms
of the original loan and the market interest rate at the
time of the reset. For many borrowers, the initial rate
was a lower-than-market “teaser” rate, so a higher-
than-market rate would be applied to the remaining bal-
ance. For this example, we will assume that the original
rate wasn’t a teaser and that the rate remains at 7%.
Keep in mind, though, that for many borrowers the
reset rate was higher than the initial rate. The balance
after the 32nd payment can be found as the future value
of the original loan and the 32 monthly payments,
so we enter these values in the financial calculator:
N = 32, I = 7%/12, PMT = 947.92, PV = −325000, and
then solve for FV = $358,242.84. The number of remain-
ing payments to amortize the $358,424.84 loan balance
is 360 −32 = 328, so the amount of each payment is
found by setting up the calculator as: N = 328, I = 7%/12,
PV = 358242.84 and FV = 0. Solving, we find that
PMT = $2,453.94.
Even if interest rates don’t change, the monthly pay-
ment jumps from $947.92 to $2,453.94 and would in-
crease even more if interest rates were higher at the
reset. This is exactly what happened to millions of
American homeowners who took out option reset
ARMS in the early 2000s. When large numbers of resets
began in 2007, defaults ballooned. The accident caused
by option reset ARMs didn’t wait very long to happen!
23For example, the formula used to find the payment of a growing annuity due is shown below. If
g = annuity growth rate and r = nominal rate of return on investment, then
PVIF of a growing annuity due ¼ PVIFGADue ¼ f1  ½ð1 þ gÞ=ð1 þ rÞNg½ð1 þ rÞ=ðr  gÞ
PMT ¼ PV=PVIFGADue
where PVIF denotes “present value interest factor.” Similar formulas are available for growing ordinary
annuities.

Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

We illustrate the spreadsheet approach in the chapter model, Ch04 Tool Kit.xls.
The spreadsheet model provides the most transparent picture of what’s happening,
since it shows the value of the retirement portfolio, the portfolio’s annual earnings,
and each withdrawal over the 20-year planning horizon—especially if you include a
graph. A picture is worth a thousand numbers, and graphs make it easy to explain the
situation to people who are planning their financial futures.
To implement the calculator approach, we first find the expected real rate of re-
turn, where rr is the real rate of return and rNOM the nominal rate of return. The
real rate of return is the return that we would see if there were no inflation. We cal-
culate the real rate as:
Real rate ¼ rr ¼ ½ð1 þ rNOMÞ=ð1 þ InflationÞ −1:0
(4-15)
¼ ½1:06=1:03 −1:0 ¼ 0:029126214 ¼ 2:9126214% (4-15)
Using this real rate of return, we solve the annuity due problem exactly as we did earlier
in the chapter. We set the calculator to Begin Mode, after which we input N=20, I/YR =
real rate=2.9126214, PV=−1,000,000, and FV=0; then we press PMT to get $64,786.88.
This is the amount of the initial withdrawal at Time 0 (today), and future withdrawals will
increase at the inflation rate of 3%. These withdrawals, growing at the inflation rate, will
provide the retiree with a constant real income over the next 20 years—provided the in-
flation rate and the rate of return do not change.
In our example we assumed that the first withdrawal would be made immediately.
The procedure would be slightly different if we wanted to make end-of-year withdra-
wals. First, we would set the calculator to End Mode. Second, we would enter the same
inputs into the calculator as just listed, including the real interest rate for I/YR. The cal-
culated PMT would be $66,673.87. However, that value is in beginning-of-year terms,
and since inflation of 3% will occur during the year, we must make the following adjust-
ment to find the inflation-adjusted initial withdrawal:
Initial end-of-year withdrawal ¼ $66;673:87ð1 þ InflationÞ
¼ $66;673:87ð1:03Þ
¼ $68;674:09:
Thus the first withdrawal at the end of the year would be $68,674.09; it would grow
by 3% per year; and after the 20th withdrawal (at the end of the 20th year) the bal-
ance in the retirement fund would be zero.
We also demonstrate the solution for this end-of-year payment example in Ch04
Tool Kit.xls. There we set up a table showing the beginning balance, the annual
withdrawals, the annual earnings, and the ending balance for each of the 20 years.
This analysis confirms the $68,674.09 initial end-of-year withdrawal derived
previously.
Example 2: Initial Deposit to Accumulate a Future Sum
As another example of growing annuities, suppose you need to accumulate $100,000
in 10 years. You plan to make a deposit in a bank now, at Time 0, and then make 9
more deposits at the beginning of each of the following 9 years, for a total of 10 de-
posits. The bank pays 6% interest, you expect inflation to be 2% per year, and you
plan to increase your annual deposits at the inflation rate. How much must you de-
posit initially? First, we calculate the real rate:
Real rate = rr = [1.06/1.02] −1.0 = 0.0392157 = 3.9215686%
Chapter 4: Time Value of Money
161

Next, since inflation is expected to be 2% per year, in 10 years the target $100,000
will have a real value of
$100,000/(1 + 0.02)10 = $82,034.83.
Now we can find the size of the required initial payment by setting a financial calcu-
lator to the Begin Mode and then inputting N = 10, I/YR = 3.9215686, PV = 0, and
FV = 82,034.83. Then, when we press the PMT key, we get PMT = −6,598.87.
Thus, a deposit of $6,598.87 made at time 0 and growing by 2% per year will accu-
mulate to $100,000 by Year 10 if the interest rate is 6%. Again, this result is con-
firmed in the chapter’s Tool Kit. The key to this analysis is to express I/YR, FV,
and PMT in real, not nominal, terms.

Summary
Most financial decisions involve situations in which someone makes a payment at one
point in time and receives money later. Dollars paid or received at two different
points in time are different, and this difference is dealt with using time value of money
(TVM) analysis.
•
Compounding is the process of determining the future value (FV) of a cash
flow or a series of cash flows. The compounded amount, or future value, is equal
to the beginning amount plus interest earned.
•
Future value of a single payment = FVN = PV(1 + I)N.
•
Discounting is the process of finding the present value (PV) of a future cash
flow or a series of cash flows; discounting is the reciprocal, or reverse, of
compounding.

Present value of a payment received at the end of Time N ¼ PV ¼

An annuity is defined as a series of equal periodic payments (PMT) for a specified

annuity.

If payments occur at the beginning of the periods rather than at the end, then we
have an annuity due. The PV of each payment is larger, because each payment
is discounted back one year less, so the PV of the annuity is also larger. Similarly,
the FV of the annuity due is larger because each payment is compounded for an
extra year. The following formulas can be used to convert the PV and FV of an
ordinary annuity to an annuity due:

PVAdue ¼ PVAordinaryð1 þ IÞ
FVAdue ¼ FVAordinaryð1 þ IÞ
•
A perpetuity is an annuity with an infinite number of payments.
Value of a perpetuity ¼ PMT
I
•
To find the PV or FV of an uneven series, find the PV or FV of each individual
cash flow and then sum them.
•
If you know the cash flows and the PV (or FV) of a cash flow stream, you can
determine its interest rate.
•
When compounding occurs more frequently than once a year, the nominal rate
must be converted to a periodic rate, and the number of years must be converted
to periods:
Periodic rateðIPERÞ ¼ Nominal annual rate ÷ Periods per year
Number of Periods ¼ Years × Periods per year
The periodic rate and number of periods is used for calculations and is shown on
time lines.
•
If you are comparing the costs of alternative loans that require payments more than
once a year, or the rates of return on investments that pay interest more than once a
year, then the comparisons should be based on effective (or equivalent) rates of
return. Here is the formula:
EAR ¼ EFF% ¼

where
INOM ¼ Nominal quoted interest rate
M ¼ Number of compounding periods per year
N ¼ Number of years
•
An amortized loan is one that is paid off with equal payments over a specified
period. An amortization schedule shows how much of each payment constitu-
tes interest, how much is used to reduce the principal, and the unpaid balance at
the end of each period. The unpaid balance at Time N must be zero.
•
A “Growing Annuity” is a stream of cash flows that grows at a constant rate for
a specified number of years. The present and future values of growing annuities
can be found with relatively complicated formulas or, more easily, with an Excel
model.

ment of $1,000 at the end of Year 4. Your friend says she can get you some of
these securities at a cost of $900 each. Your money is now invested in a bank that
pays an 8% nominal (quoted) interest rate but with quarterly compounding. You re-
gard the securities as being just as safe, and as liquid, as your bank deposit, so your
required effective annual rate of return on the securities is the same as that on your

Required Annuity
Payments
Assume that your father is now 50 years old, that he plans to retire in 10 years, and
that he expects to live for 25 years after he retires—that is, until age 85. He wants his
first retirement payment to have the same purchasing power at the time he retires as
$40,000 has today. He wants all of his subsequent retirement payments to be equal to
his first retirement payment. (Do not let the retirement payments grow with infla-
tion: Your father realizes that the real value of his retirement income will decline
year by year after he retires.) His retirement income will begin the day he retires,
10 years from today, and he will then receive 24 additional annual payments. Infla-
tion is expected to be 5% per year from today forward. He currently has $100,000
saved up; and he expects to earn a return on his savings of 8% per year with annual
compounding. To the nearest dollar, how much must he save during each of the next
10 years (with equal deposits being made at the end of each year, beginning a year
from today) to meet his retirement goal? (Note: Neither the amount he saves nor
the amount he withdraws upon retirement is a growing annuity.)

Growing Annuity
Payments
You want to accumulate $1 million by your retirement date, which is 25 years from now.
You will make 25 deposits in your bank, with the first occurring today. The bank pays 8%
interest, compounded annually. You expect to get annual raises of 3%, which will offset
inflation, and you will let the amount you deposit each year also grow by 3% (i.e., your
second deposit will be 3% greater than your first, the third will be 3% greater than the
second, etc.). How much must your first deposit be if you are to meet your goal?

annual interest rate, and you plan to leave the money in the bank unless you buy
the note. The note is not risky—you are sure it will be paid on schedule. Should
you buy the note? Check the decision in three ways: (1) by comparing your future
value if you buy the note versus leaving your money in the bank; (2) by comparing
the PV of the note with your current bank account; and (3) by comparing the EFF%
on the note with that of the bank account.

C H A P T E R 5
Bonds, Bond Valuation,
and Interest Rates
A
lot of U.S. bonds have been issued, and we mean a lot! According to
the Federal Reserve, there are about $5.7 trillion of outstanding U.S.
Treasury securities, more than $2.6 trillion of municipal securities, $3.7
trillion of corporate bonds, and more than $1.4 billion of foreign bonds held
in the United States. Not only is the dollar amount mind-boggling, but so is
the variety. Bonds come in many shapes and flavors, and one even has a
negative interest rate.
How can a bond have a negative rate? First, consider a bond that makes
no payments before it comes due. For example, an investor might buy a
bond today for $558 in exchange for the promise of $1,000 in 10 years.
The investor would not receive any cash interest payments, but the 10-year
increase from the original purchase price to the $1,000 repayment
would provide a 6% annual return on the investment. Although there are
no annual cash interest payments, the government still allows corporate
issuers to deduct an imputed annual interest expense from their taxable
income based on the bond’s annual appreciation in value. Thus, the
company gets a tax deduction each year, even though it isn’t making actual
interest payments.
Berkshire Hathaway (chaired by Warren Buffett) issued bonds with a
negative interest rate in 2002. Technically, Berkshire’s bonds called for a 3%
interest payment, but they also had an attached warrant that would allow an
investor to purchase shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock at a fixed price in the
future. If the stock price rises above the specified price, then investors can
profit by exercising the warrants. However, Berkshire Hathaway didn’t just
give away the warrants—it required investors to make annual installment
payments equal to 3.75% of the bond’s face value. Thus, investors receive a
3% interest payment but must then pay a 3.75% warrant fee, for a net
interest rate of negative 0.75%. Berkshire Hathaway can deduct the 3%
interest payment for tax purposes, but the 3.75% warrant fee is not taxable,
further increasing Berkshire Hathaway’s annual after-tax cash flow.
Think about the implications of these and other bonds as you read this
chapter.

Growing companies must acquire land, buildings, equipment, inventory, and
other operating assets. The debt markets are a major source of funding for such
purchases. Therefore, every manager should have a working knowledge of the
types of bonds that companies and government agencies issue, the terms that are
contained in bond contracts, the types of risks to which both bond investors and
issuers are exposed, and procedures for determining the values of and rates of re-
turn on bonds.
5.1 WHO ISSUES BONDS?
A bond is a long-term contract under which a borrower agrees to make payments
of interest and principal, on specific dates, to the holders of the bond. For example,
on January 5, 2011, MicroDrive Inc. borrowed $50 million by issuing $50 million
of bonds. For convenience, we assume that MicroDrive sold 50,000 individual
bonds for $1,000 each. Actually, it could have sold one $50 million bond, 10
bonds with a $5 million face value, or any other combination that totals to $50
million. In any event, MicroDrive received the $50 million, and in exchange it
promised to make annual interest payments and to repay the $50 million on a spec-
ified maturity date.
Intrinsic Value and the Cost of Debt
This chapter explains bond pricing and bond risk, which
affect the return demanded by a firm’s bondholders. A
bondholder’s return is a cost from the company’s point
of view. This cost of debt affects the firm’s weighted
average cost of capital (WACC), which in turn affects
the company’s intrinsic value. Therefore, it is important
for all managers to understand the cost of debt, which
we explain in this chapter.

Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

Investors have many choices when investing in bonds, but bonds are classified into
four main types: Treasury, corporate, municipal, and foreign. Each type differs with
respect to expected return and degree of risk.
Treasury bonds, sometimes referred to as government bonds, are issued by the
U.S. federal government.1 It is reasonable to assume that the federal government
will make good on its promised payments, so these bonds have almost no default
risk. However, Treasury bond prices decline when interest rates rise, so they are
not free of all risks.
Federal agencies and other government-sponsored entities (GSEs) include the
Tennessee Valley Authority, the Small Business Administration, Fannie Mae, Freddie
Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank System, among others. Agency debt and
GSE debt are not officially backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. govern-
ment, but investors assume that the government implicitly guarantees this debt, so
these bonds carry interest rates only slightly higher than Treasury bonds. In 2008,
the implicit guarantee became much more explicit as the government placed several
GSEs into conservatorship, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Corporate bonds, as the name implies, are issued by corporations. Unlike Trea-
sury bonds, corporate bonds are exposed to default risk—if the issuing company gets
into trouble, it may be unable to make the promised interest and principal payments.
Different corporate bonds have different levels of default risk, depending on the issu-
ing company’s characteristics and the terms of the specific bond. Default risk is often
referred to as “credit risk,” and the larger the credit risk, the higher the interest rate
the issuer must pay.
Municipal bonds, or “munis,” are issued by state and local governments. Like
corporate bonds, munis have default risk. However, munis offer one major advantage:
The interest earned on most municipal bonds is exempt from federal taxes and also
from state taxes if the holder is a resident of the issuing state. Consequently, munici-
pal bonds carry interest rates that are considerably lower than those on corporate
bonds with the same default risk.
Foreign bonds are issued by foreign governments or foreign corporations. For-
eign corporate bonds are, of course, exposed to default risk, and so are some foreign
government bonds. An additional risk exists if the bonds are denominated in a cur-
rency other than that of the investor’s home currency. For example, if a U.S. investor
purchases a corporate bond denominated in Japanese yen and if the yen subsequently
falls relative to the dollar, then the investor will lose money even if the company does
not default on its bonds.

5.2 KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF BONDS
Although all bonds have some common characteristics, they do not always have iden-
tical contractual features, as described below.
1The U.S. Treasury actually issues three types of securities: “bills,” “notes,” and “bonds.” A bond makes
an equal payment every 6 months until it matures, at which time it makes an additional lump-sum pay-
ment. If the maturity at the time of issue is less than 10 years, the security is called a note rather than a
bond. A T-bill has a maturity of 52 weeks or less at the time of issue, and it makes no payments at all un-
til it matures. Thus, T-bills are sold initially at a discount to their face, or maturity, value.
Chapter 5: Bonds, Bond Valuation, and Interest Rates
175

Par Value
The par value is the stated face value of the bond; for illustrative purposes, we gen-
erally assume a par value of $1,000. In practice, some bonds have par values that are
multiples of $1,000 (for example, $5,000) and some have par values of less than
$1,000 (Treasury bonds can be purchased in multiples of $100). The par value gen-
erally represents the amount of money the firm borrows and promises to repay on
the maturity date.
Coupon Interest Rate
MicroDrive’s bonds require the company to pay a fixed number of dollars of interest
every year (or, more typically, every 6 months). When this coupon payment, as it is
called, is divided by the par value, the result is the coupon interest rate. For exam-
ple, MicroDrive’s bonds have a $1,000 par value, and they pay $100 in interest each
year. The bond’s coupon interest is $100, so its coupon interest rate is $100/$1,000 =
10%. The coupon payment, which is fixed at the time the bond is issued, remains in
force during the life of the bond.2 Typically, at the time a bond is issued, its coupon
payment is set at a level that will enable the bond to be issued at or near its par value.
In some cases, a bond’s coupon payment will vary over time. For these floating-
rate bonds, the coupon rate is set for, say, the initial 6-month period, after which it
is adjusted every 6 months based on some market rate. Some corporate issues are tied
to the Treasury bond rate; other issues are tied to other rates, such as LIBOR (the
London Interbank Offered Rate). Many additional provisions can be included in
floating-rate issues. For example, some are convertible to fixed-rate debt, whereas
others have upper and lower limits (“caps” and “floors”) on how high or low the
rate can go.
Floating-rate debt is popular with investors who are worried about the risk of ris-
ing interest rates, since the interest paid on such bonds increases whenever market
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
Betting With or Against the U.S. Government:
The Case of Treasury Bond Credit Default Swaps
It might be hard to believe, but there is actually a mar-
ket for U.S. Treasury bond insurance. In early 2009, a
credit default swap (CDS) on a 5-year T-bond was sell-
ing for 71 basis points (a basis point is 1 percentage
point). This means that you could pay $7.10 a year to
a counterparty who would promise to insure $1,000
of T-bond principal against default. Considering that
the T-bond pays only $18.75 a year in interest, the
insurance would eat up a lot of the annual interest
for an investor who owned the bond. However, most
of the trading in this CDS is by speculators and hedgers
who don’t even own the T-bond but are simply betting
for or against the financial soundness of the U.S.
government.
But it does make you wonder: “If the United States
fails, who will be around to pay off the CDS?"!
2At one time, bonds literally had a number of small coupons attached to them, and on each interest pay-
ment date the owner would clip off the coupon for that date and either cash it at the bank or mail it to
the company’s paying agent, who would then mail back a check for the interest. For example, a 30-year,
semiannual bond would start with 60 coupons. Today, most new bonds are registered—no physical cou-
pons are involved, and interest checks are mailed automatically to the registered owners.

rates rise. This causes the market value of the debt to be stabilized, and it also pro-
vides institutional buyers, such as banks, with income that is better geared to their
own obligations. Banks’ deposit costs rise with interest rates, so the income on
floating-rate loans they have made rises at the same time as their deposit costs rise.
The savings and loan industry was almost destroyed as a result of its former practice
of making fixed-rate mortgage loans but borrowing on floating-rate terms. If you are
earning 6% fixed but paying 10% floating (which they were), you will soon go bank-
rupt (which they did). Moreover, floating-rate debt appeals to corporations that want
to issue long-term debt without committing themselves to paying a historically high
interest rate for the entire life of the loan.
Some bonds pay no coupons at all but are offered at a substantial discount below
their par values and hence provide capital appreciation rather than interest income.
These securities are called zero coupon bonds (“zeros”). Most zero coupon bonds
are Treasury bonds, although a few corporations, such as Coca-Cola, have zero cou-
pon bonds outstanding. Some bonds are issued with a coupon rate too low for the
bond to be issued at par, so the bond is issued at a price less than its par value. In
general, any bond originally offered at a price significantly below its par value is
called an original issue discount (OID) bond.
Some bonds don’t pay cash coupons but pay coupons consisting of additional
bonds (or a percentage of an additional bond). These are called payment-in-kind
bonds, or just PIK bonds. PIK bonds are usually issued by companies with cash
flow problems, which makes them risky.
Some bonds have a step-up provision: If the company’s bond rating is down-
graded, then it must increase the bond’s coupon rate. Step-ups are more popular in
Europe than in the United States, but that is beginning to change. Note that a step-
up is quite dangerous from the company’s standpoint. The downgrade means that it
is having trouble servicing its debt, and the step-up will exacerbate the problem. This
combination has led to a number of bankruptcies.
Maturity Date
Bonds generally have a specified maturity date on which the par value must be
repaid. MicroDrive bonds issued on January 5, 2011, will mature on January 5,
2026; thus, they have a 15-year maturity at the time they are issued. Most bonds
have original maturities (the maturity at the time the bond is issued) ranging from
10 to 40 years, but any maturity is legally permissible.3 Of course, the effective matu-
rity of a bond declines each year after it has been issued. Thus, MicroDrive’s bonds
have a 15-year original maturity, but in 2012, a year later, they will have a 14-year
maturity, and so on.
Provisions to Call or Redeem Bonds
Most corporate bonds contain a call provision, which gives the issuing corporation
the right to call the bonds for redemption.4 The call provision generally states that
the company must pay the bondholders an amount greater than the par value if
they are called. The additional sum, which is termed a call premium, is often set
equal to 1 year’s interest if the bonds are called during the first year, and the

3In July 1993, Walt Disney Co., attempting to lock in a low interest rate, issued the first 100-year bonds
to be sold by any borrower in modern times. Soon after, Coca-Cola became the second company to
stretch the meaning of “long-term bond” by selling $150 million of 100-year bonds.
4A majority of municipal bonds also contain call provisions. Although the U.S. Treasury no longer issues
callable bonds, some past Treasury issues were callable.
Chapter 5: Bonds, Bond Valuation, and Interest Rates
177

premium declines at a constant rate of INT/N each year thereafter (where INT =
annual interest and N = original maturity in years). For example, the call premium
on a $1,000 par value, 10-year, 10% bond would generally be $100 if it were called
during the first year, $90 during the second year (calculated by reducing the $100, or
10%, premium by one-tenth), and so on. However, bonds are often not callable until
several years (generally 5 to 10) after they are issued. This is known as a deferred
call, and the bonds are said to have call protection.
Suppose a company sold bonds when interest rates were relatively high. Provided
the issue is callable, the company could sell a new issue of low-yielding securities
if and when interest rates drop. It could then use the proceeds of the new issue to
retire the high-rate issue and thus reduce its interest expense. This process is called
a refunding operation.
A call provision is valuable to the firm but potentially detrimental to investors. If
interest rates go up, the company will not call the bond, and the investor will be
stuck with the original coupon rate on the bond, even though interest rates in the
economy have risen sharply. However, if interest rates fall, the company will call the
bond and pay off investors, who then must reinvest the proceeds at the current mar-
ket interest rate, which is lower than the rate they were getting on the original bond.
In other words, the investor loses when interest rates go up but doesn’t reap the gains
when rates fall. To induce an investor to take this type of risk, a new issue of callable
bonds must provide a higher coupon rate than an otherwise similar issue of noncall-
able bonds.
Bonds that are redeemable at par at the holder’s option protect investors against
a rise in interest rates. If rates rise, the price of a fixed-rate bond declines. However,
if holders have the option of turning their bonds in and having them redeemed at
par, then they are protected against rising rates. If interest rates have risen, holders
will turn in the bonds and reinvest the proceeds at a higher rate.
Event risk is the chance that some sudden event will occur and increase the
credit risk of a company, hence lowering the firm’s bond rating and the value of
its outstanding bonds. Investors’ concern over event risk means that those firms
deemed most likely to face events that could harm bondholders must pay ex-
tremely high interest rates. To reduce this interest rate, some bonds have a cove-
nant called a super poison put, which enables a bondholder to turn in, or “put,”
a bond back to the issuer at par in the event of a takeover, merger, or major
recapitalization.
Some bonds have a make-whole call provision. This allows a company to call
the bond, but it must pay a call price that is essentially equal to the market value of
a similar noncallable bond. This provides companies with an easy way to repurchase
bonds as part of a financial restructuring, such as a merger.
Sinking Funds
Some bonds include a sinking fund provision that facilitates the orderly retirement
of the bond issue. On rare occasions the firm may be required to deposit money with
a trustee, which invests the funds and then uses the accumulated sum to retire the
bonds when they mature. Usually, though, the sinking fund is used to buy back a
certain percentage of the issue each year. A failure to meet the sinking fund require-
ment causes the bond to be thrown into default, which may force the company into
bankruptcy.
In most cases, the firm is given the right to administer the sinking fund in either
of two ways.
178
Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

1. The company can call in for redemption (at par value) a certain percentage of the
bonds each year; for example, it might be able to call 5% of the total original
amount of the issue at a price of $1,000 per bond. The bonds are numbered
serially, and those called for redemption are determined by a lottery administered
by the trustee.
2. The company may buy the required number of bonds on the open market.
The firm will choose the least-cost method. If interest rates have risen, causing bond
prices to fall, then it will buy bonds in the open market at a discount; if interest rates
have fallen, it will call the bonds. Note that a call for sinking fund purposes is quite
different from a refunding call as discussed previously. A sinking fund call typically
requires no call premium, but only a small percentage of the issue is normally callable
in any one year.5
Although sinking funds are designed to protect bondholders by ensuring that an
issue is retired in an orderly fashion, you should recognize that sinking funds can
work to the detriment of bondholders. For example, suppose that the bond carries a
10% interest rate but that yields on similar bonds have fallen to 7.5%. A sinking fund
call at par would require an investor to give up a bond that pays $100 of interest and
then to reinvest in a bond that pays only $75 per year. This obviously harms those
bondholders whose bonds are called. On balance, however, bonds that have a sinking
fund are regarded as being safer than those without such a provision, so at the time
they are issued sinking fund bonds have lower coupon rates than otherwise similar
bonds without sinking funds.
Other Provisions and Features
Owners of convertible bonds have the option to convert the bonds into a fixed
number of shares of common stock. Convertibles offer investors the chance to
share in the upside if a company does well, so investors are willing to accept a lower
coupon rate on convertibles than on an otherwise identical but nonconvertible
bond.
Warrants are options that permit the holder to buy stock at a fixed price, thereby
providing a gain if the price of the stock rises. Some bonds are issued with warrants.
As with convertibles, bonds with warrants have lower coupon rates than straight
bonds.
An income bond is required to pay interest only if earnings are high enough to
cover the interest expense. If earnings are not sufficient, then the company is not re-
quired to pay interest and the bondholders do not have the right to force the com-
pany into bankruptcy. Therefore, from an investor’s standpoint, income bonds are
riskier than “regular” bonds.
Indexed bonds, also called purchasing power bonds, first became popular in
Brazil, Israel, and a few other countries plagued by high inflation rates. The interest
payments and maturity payment rise automatically when the inflation rate rises, thus
protecting the bondholders against inflation. In January 1997, the U.S. Treasury began
issuing indexed bonds called TIPS, short for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities.
Later in this chapter we show how TIPS can be used to estimate the risk-free rate.
Bond Markets
Corporate bonds are traded primarily in electronic/telephone markets rather than in
organized exchanges. Most bonds are owned by and traded among a relatively small

number of very large financial institutions, including banks, investment banks, life in-
surance companies, mutual funds, and pension funds. Although these institutions buy
and sell very large blocks of bonds, it is relatively easy for bond dealers to arrange
transactions because there are relatively few players in this market as compared with
stock markets.
Information on bond trades is not widely published, but a representative group of
bonds is listed and traded on the bond division of the NYSE and is reported on the
bond market page of The Wall Street Journal. Bond data are also available on the In-
ternet at sites such as http://finance.yahoo.com.

5.3 BOND VALUATION
The value of any financial asset—a stock, a bond, a lease, or even a physical asset
such as an apartment building or a piece of machinery—is simply the present value
of the cash flows the asset is expected to produce. The cash flows from a specific
bond depend on its contractual features as described in the previous section. For a
standard coupon-bearing bond such as the one issued by MicroDrive, the cash flows
consist of interest payments during the life of the bond plus the amount borrowed
when the bond matures (usually a $1,000 par value):

The notation in the time line is explained below.
rd = The bond’s required rate of return, which is the market rate of interest
for that type of bond. This is the discount rate that is used to calculate
the present value of the bond’s cash flows. It is also called the “yield” or
“going rate of interest.” Note that rd is not the coupon interest rate.
It is equal to the coupon rate only if (as in this case) the bond is selling
at par. Generally, most coupon bonds are issued at par, which implies
that the coupon rate is set at rd. Thereafter, interest rates, as measured
by rd, will fluctuate, but the coupon rate is fixed, so rd will equal the
coupon rate only by chance. We use the term “i” or “I” to designate
the interest rate for many calculations because those terms are used on
financial calculators, but “r,” with the subscript “d” to designate the rate
on a debt security, is normally used in finance.

Observe that the cash flows consist of an annuity of N years plus a lump-sum
payment at the end of Year N. Equation 5-1 can be solved by using (1) a formula,
(2) a financial calculator, or (3) a spreadsheet.
Solving for the Bond Price
Recall that MicroDrive issued a 15-year bond with an annual coupon rate of 10%
and a par value of $1,000. To find the value of MicroDrive’s bond by using a for-
mula, insert values for MicroDrive’s bond into Equation 5-1:

(5-1a)
You could use the first line of Equation 5-1a to discount each cash flow back to
the present and then sum these PVs to find the bond’s value; see Figure 5-1. This
procedure is not very efficient, especially if the bond has many years to maturity.
N = Number of years before the bond matures. Note that N declines each
year after the bond was issued, so a bond that had a maturity of 15 years
when it was issued (original maturity = 15) will have N = 14 after 1 year,
N = 13 after 2 years, and so on. Note also that for the sake of simplicity
we assume the bond pays interest once a year, or annually, so N is
measured in years. We consider bonds with semiannual payment bonds
later in the chapter.
INT = Dollars of interest paid each year = (Coupon rate)(Par value). For
a bond with a 10% coupon and a $1,000 par value, the annual interest
is 0.10($1,000) = $100. In calculator terminology, INT = PMT = 100.
If the bond had been a semiannual payment bond, the payment would
have been $50 every 6 months.
M = Par, or maturity, value of the bond. This amount must be paid off at
maturity, and it is often equal to $1,000.

Alternatively, you could use the formula in the second line of Equation 5-1a with a
simple or scientific calculator, although this would still be somewhat cumbersome.
A financial calculator is ideally suited for finding bond values. Here is the setup for
MicroDrive’s bond:

Inputs:
Input N = 15, I/YR = rd = 10, INT = PMT = 100, and M = FV = 1000; then press
the PV key to find the value of the bond, $1,000. Since the PV is an outflow to the
investor, it is shown with a negative sign. The calculator is programmed to solve
Equation 5-1: It finds the PV of an annuity of $100 per year for 15 years, discounted
at 10%, then it finds the PV of the $1,000 maturity payment, and then it adds
these two PVs to find the value of the bond. Notice that even though the time line
in Figure 5-1 shows a total of $1,100 at Year 15, you should not enter FV = 1100!
When you entered N = 15 and PMT = 100, you told the calculator that there is a
$100 payment at Year 15. Thus, setting FV = 1000 accounts for any extra payment
at Year 15, above and beyond the $100 payment.
With Excel, it is easiest to use the PV function: =PV(I,N,PMT,FV,0). For Mi-
croDrive’s bond, the function is =PV(0.10,15,100,1000,0) with a result of −$1,000.
Like the financial calculator solution, the bond value is negative because PMT and
FV are positive.
Excel also provides specialized functions for bond prices based on actual dates. For
example, in Excel you could find the MicroDrive bond value as of the date it was is-
sued by using the function wizard to enter this formula:

Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

The first two arguments in the function are Excel’s DATE function. The DATE
function takes the year, month, and day as inputs and converts them into a date.
The first argument is the date on which you want to find the price, and the second
argument is the maturity date. The third argument in the PRICE function is the
bond’s coupon rate, followed by the required return on the bond, rd. The fifth
argument, 100, is the redemption value of the bond at maturity per $100 of
face value; entering “100” means that the bond pays 100% of its face value when
it matures. The sixth argument is the number of payments per year. The last
argument, 1, tells the program to base the price on the actual number of days in
each month and year. This function produces a result based upon a face value of
$100. In other words, if the bond pays $100 of face value at maturity, then the
PRICE function result is the price of the bond. Because MicroDrive’s bond pays
$1,000 of face value at maturity, we must multiply the PRICE function’s result by
10. In this example, the PRICE function returns a result of $100. When we multi-
ply it by 10, we get the actual price of $1,000. This function is essential if a bond
is being evaluated between coupon payment dates. See Ch05 Tool Kit.xls on the
textbook’s Web site for an example.6
Interest Rate Changes and Bond Prices
In this example, the bond is selling at a price equal to its par value. Whenever the
going market rate of interest, rd, is equal to the coupon rate, a fixed-rate bond will
sell at its par value. Normally, the coupon rate is set at the going rate when a bond
is issued, causing it to sell at par initially.
The coupon rate remains fixed after the bond is issued, but interest rates in the
market move up and down. Looking at Equation 5-1, we see that an increase in the
market interest rate (rd) will cause the price of an outstanding bond to fall, whereas a
decrease in rates will cause the bond’s price to rise. For example, if the market interest
rate on MicroDrive’s bond increased to 15% immediately after it was issued, we
would recalculate the price with the new market interest rate as follows:
FV

PMT
PMT

Inputs:
The price would fall to $707.63. Notice that the bond would then sell at a
price below its par value. Whenever the going rate of interest rises above the cou-
pon rate, a fixed-rate bond’s price will fall below its par value, and it is called a
discount bond.
6The bond prices quoted by brokers are calculated as described. However, if you bought a bond between
interest payment dates, you would have to pay the basic price plus accrued interest. Thus, if you pur-
chased a MicroDrive bond 6 months after it was issued, your broker would send you an invoice stating
that you must pay $1,000 as the basic price of the bond plus $50 interest, representing one-half the annual
interest of $100. The seller of the bond would receive $1,050. If you bought the bond the day before its
interest payment date, you would pay $1,000 + (364/365)($100) = $1,099.73. Of course, you would receive
an interest payment of $100 at the end of the next day. For more on the valuation of bonds between pay-
ment dates, see Richard Taylor, “The Valuation of Semiannual Bonds between Interest Payment Dates,”
The Financial Review, August 1988, pp. 365–368, and K. S. Maurice Tse and Mark A. White, “The Valua-
tion of Semiannual Bonds between Interest Payment Dates: A Correction,” Financial Review, November
1990, pp. 659–662.

On the other hand, bond prices rise when market interest rates fall. For example,
if the market interest rate on MicroDrive’s bond decreased to 5%, then we would
once again recalculate its price:

In this case, the price rises to $1,518.98. In general, whenever the going interest
rate falls below the coupon rate, a fixed-rate bond’s price will rise above its par value,
and it is called a premium bond.

of $80, and a market interest rate of 9%. What is its price? ($955.14)

and a market interest rate of 7%. What is its price? ($1,301.77)
5.4 CHANGES IN BOND VALUES OVER TIME
At the time a coupon bond is issued, the coupon is generally set at a level that will
cause the market price of the bond to equal its par value. If a lower coupon were set
then investors would not be willing to pay $1,000 for the bond, and if a higher cou-
pon were set then investors would clamor for the bond and bid its price up over
$1,000. Investment bankers can judge quite precisely the coupon rate that will cause
a bond to sell at its $1,000 par value.
A bond that has just been issued is known as a new issue. (Investment bankers
classify a bond as a new issue for about a month after it has first been issued. New
issues are usually actively traded and are called “on-the-run” bonds.) Once the bond
has been on the market for a while, it is classified as an outstanding bond, also
called a seasoned issue. Newly issued bonds generally sell very close to par, but
the prices of seasoned bonds vary widely from par. Except for floating-rate bonds,
coupon payments are constant, so when economic conditions change, a 10% coupon
bond with a $100 coupon that sold at par when it was issued will sell for more or less
than $1,000 thereafter.
MicroDrive’s bonds with a 10% coupon rate were originally issued at par. If rd
remained constant at 10%, what would the value of the bond be 1 year after it was
issued? Now the term to maturity is only 14 years—that is, N = 14. With a financial
calculator, just override N = 15 with N = 14, press the PV key, and you find a value
of $1,000. If we continued, setting N = 13, N = 12, and so forth, we would see that
the value of the bond will remain at $1,000 as long as the going interest rate remains
constant at the coupon rate, 10%.
Now suppose interest rates in the economy fell after the MicroDrive bonds were
issued and, as a result, rd fell below the coupon rate, decreasing from 10% to 5%. Both
the coupon interest payments and the maturity value remain constant, but now 5%
would have to be used for rd in Equation 5-1. The value of the bond at the end of
the first year would be $1,494.93:

With a financial calculator, just change rd = I/YR from 10 to 5, and then press the
PV key to get the answer, $1,494.93. Thus, if rd fell below the coupon rate, the bond
would sell above par, or at a premium.
The arithmetic of the bond value increase should be clear, but what is the logic be-
hind it? Because rd has fallen to 5%, with $1,000 to invest you could buy new bonds
like MicroDrive’s (every day some ten to twelve companies sell new bonds), except that
these new bonds would pay $50 of interest each year rather than $100. Naturally,
you would prefer $100 to $50, so you would be willing to pay more than $1,000 for a
MicroDrive bond to obtain its higher coupons. All investors would react similarly; as a
result, the MicroDrive bonds would be bid up in price to $1,494.93, at which point they
would provide the same 5% rate of return to a potential investor as the new bonds.
Assuming that interest rates remain constant at 5% for the next 14 years, what
would happen to the value of a MicroDrive bond? It would fall gradually from
$1,494.93 at present to $1,000 at maturity, when MicroDrive will redeem each
bond for $1,000. This point can be illustrated by calculating the value of the bond 1
year later, when it has 13 years remaining to maturity. With a financial calculator,
simply input the values for N, I/YR, PMT, and FV, now using N = 13, and press
the PV key to find the value of the bond, $1,469.68. Thus, the value of the bond
will have fallen from $1,494.93 to $1,469.68, or by $25.25. If you were to calculate
the value of the bond at other future dates, the price would continue to fall as the
maturity date approached.
Note that if you purchased the bond at a price of $1,494.93 and then sold it 1 year
later with rd still at 5%, you would have a capital loss of $25.25, or a total return of
$100.00 −$25.25 = $74.75. Your percentage rate of return would consist of the rate
of return due to the interest payment (called the current yield) and the rate of return
due to the price change (called the capital gains yield). This total rate of return is
often called the bond yield, and it is calculated as follows:
Interest; or current; yield ¼
$100=$1; 494:93 ¼
0:0669 ¼
6:69%
Capital gains yield ¼ −$25:25=$1; 494:93 ¼ −0:0169 ¼ −1:69%
Total rate of return; or yield ¼
$74:75=$1; 494:93 ¼
0:0500 ¼
5:00%
Had interest rates risen from 10% to 15% during the first year after issue (rather
than falling from 10% to 5%), then you would enter N = 14, I/YR = 15, PMT = 100,
and FV = 1000, and then press the PV key to find the value of the bond, $713.78. In
this case, the bond would sell below its par value, or at a discount. The total expected
future return on the bond would again consist of an expected return due to interest
and an expected return due to capital gains or capital losses. In this situation, the cap-
ital gains yield would be positive. The total return would be 15%. To see this, calcu-
late the price of the bond with 13 years left to maturity, assuming that interest rates
remain at 15%. With a calculator, enter N = 13, I/YR = 15, PMT = 100, and FV =
1000; then press PV to obtain the bond’s value, $720.84.
Chapter 5: Bonds, Bond Valuation, and Interest Rates
185

Note that the capital gain for the year is the difference between the bond’s value
at Year 2 (with 13 years remaining) and the bond’s value at Year 1 (with 14 years
remaining), or $720.84 −$713.78 = $7.06. The interest yield, capital gains yield,
and total yield are calculated as follows:
Interest; or current; yield ¼
$100=$713:78 ¼ 0:1401 ¼ 14:01%
Capital gains yield ¼
$7:06=$713:78 ¼ 0:0099 ¼
0:99%
Total rate of return; or yield ¼ $107:06=$713:78 ¼ 0:1500 ¼ 15:00%
Figure 5-2 graphs the value of the bond over time, assuming that interest rates in the
economy (1) remain constant at 10%, (2) fall to 5% and then remain constant at that
level, or (3) rise to 15% and remain constant at that level. Of course, if interest rates do
not remain constant, then the price of the bond will fluctuate. However, regardless of
what future interest rates do, the bond’s price will approach $1,000 as it nears the ma-
turity date (barring bankruptcy, in which case the bond’s value might fall dramatically).
Figure 5-2 illustrates the following key points.
1. Whenever the going rate of interest, rd, is equal to the coupon rate, a fixed-rate
bond will sell at its par value. Normally, the coupon rate is set equal to the going
rate when a bond is issued, causing it to sell at par initially.
2. Interest rates do change over time, but the coupon rate remains fixed after the
bond has been issued. Whenever the going rate of interest rises above the coupon
rate, a fixed-rate bond’s price will fall below its par value. Such a bond is called a
discount bond.
3. Whenever the going rate of interest falls below the coupon rate, a fixed-rate
bond’s price will rise above its par value. Such a bond is called a premium bond.
4. Thus, an increase in interest rates will cause the prices of outstanding bonds to
fall, whereas a decrease in rates will cause bond prices to rise.

5. The market value of a bond will always approach its par value as its maturity date
approaches, provided the firm does not go bankrupt.
These points are very important, for they show that bondholders may suffer capital
losses or make capital gains depending on whether interest rates rise or fall after the
bond is purchased.

5.5 BONDS WITH SEMIANNUAL COUPONS
Although some bonds pay interest annually, the vast majority actually pay interest
semiannually. To evaluate semiannual payment bonds, we must modify the valuation
model as follows.
1. Divide the annual coupon interest payment by 2 to determine the dollars of in-
terest paid every 6 months.
2. Multiply the years to maturity, N, by 2 to determine the number of semiannual
periods.
3. Divide the nominal (quoted) interest rate, rd, by 2 to determine the periodic
(semiannual) interest rate.
By making these changes, we obtain the following equation for finding the value
of a bond that pays interest semiannually:

In 1996, Chateau Teyssier, an English vineyard, was
looking for some cash to purchase additional vines
and to modernize its production facilities. Their solu-
tion? With the assistance of a leading underwriter, Ma-
trix Securities, the vineyard issued 375 bonds, each
costing 2,650 British pounds. The issue raised nearly 1
million pounds, or roughly $1.5 million.
What makes these bonds interesting is that, instead
of paying with something boring like money, they paid
their investors back with wine. Each June until 2002,
when
the
bond
matured,
investors
received
their
“coupons.” Between 1997 and 2001, each bond pro-
vided six cases of the vineyard’s rosé or claret. Starting
in 1998 and continuing through maturity in 2002, inves-
tors also received four cases of its prestigious Saint
Emilion Grand Cru. Then, in 2002, they got their money
back.
The bonds were not without risk. The vineyard’s
owner, Jonathan Malthus, acknowledged that the qual-
ity of the wine “is at the mercy of the gods."

Describe how the annual bond valuation formula is changed to evaluate semiannual
coupon bonds. Write out the revised formula.
A bond has a 25-year maturity, an 8% annual coupon paid semiannually, and a face
value of $1,000. The going nominal annual interest rate (rd) is 6%. What is the bond’s
price? ($1,257.30)
5.6 BOND YIELDS
Unlike the coupon interest rate, which is fixed, the bond’s yield varies from day to day
depending on current market conditions. Moreover, the yield can be calculated in
three different ways, and three “answers” can be obtained. These different yields are
described in the following sections.
Yield to Maturity
Suppose you were offered a 14-year, 10% annual coupon, $1,000 par value bond at a
price of $1,494.93. What rate of interest would you earn on your investment if you
bought the bond and held it to maturity? This rate is called the bond’s yield to ma-
turity (YTM), and it is the interest rate generally discussed by investors when they
talk about rates of return. The yield to maturity is usually the same as the market rate
of interest, rd. To find the YTM for a bond with annual interest payments, you must
solve Equation 5-1 for rd:8
Bond price ¼∑

7In this situation, the coupon rate of “10% paid semiannually” is the rate that bond dealers, corporate
treasurers, and investors generally would discuss. Of course, if this bond were issued at par, then its effec-
tive annual rate would be higher than 10%:

Because 10% with annual payments is quite different from 10% with semiannual payments, we have as-
sumed a change in effective rates in this section from the situation described in Section 5.3, where we as-
sumed 10% with annual payments.
8If the bond has semiannual payments, you must solve Equation 5-2 for rd.

You could substitute values for rd until you found a value that “works” and forces the
sum of the PVs on the right side of the equal sign to equal $1,494.93, but this would
be tedious and time-consuming.9 As you might guess, it is much easier with a finan-
cial calculator. Here is the setup:

Simply enter N = 14, PV = −1494.93, PMT = 100, and FV = 1000, and then press the
I/YR key for the answer of 5%.
You could also find the YTM with a spreadsheet. In Excel, you would use the RATE
function for this bond, inputting N = 14, PMT = 100, PV = −1494.93, FV = 1000, 0 for
Type, and leave Guess blank: =RATE(14,100,−1494.93,1000,0). The result is 5%.
The RATE function works only if the current date is immediately after either the
issue date or a coupon payment date. To find bond yields on other dates, use Excel’s
YIELD function. See the Ch05 Tool Kit.xls file for an example.
The yield to maturity can be viewed as the bond’s promised rate of return, which is
the return that investors will receive if all the promised payments are made. How-
ever, the yield to maturity equals the expected rate of return only if (1) the probability
of default is zero and (2) the bond cannot be called. If there is some default risk or if
the bond may be called, then there is some probability that the promised payments to
maturity will not be received, in which case the calculated yield to maturity will differ
from the expected return.
The YTM for a bond that sells at par consists entirely of an interest yield, but if
the bond sells at a price other than its par value then the YTM will consist of the
interest yield plus a positive or negative capital gains yield. Note also that a bond’s
yield to maturity changes whenever interest rates in the economy change, and this is
almost daily. If you purchase a bond and hold it until it matures, you will receive the
YTM that existed on the purchase date but the bond’s calculated YTM will change
frequently between the purchase date and the maturity date.10
9Alternatively, you can substitute values of rd into the third form of Equation 5-1 until you find a value
that works.

See Ch05 Tool Kit.xls on
the textbook’s Web site.
10We often are asked by students if the purchaser of a bond will receive the YTM if interest rates subse-
quently change. The answer is definitely “yes” provided the question means “Is the realized rate of return
on the investment in the bond equal to the YTM?” This is because the realized rate of return on an in-
vestment is the rate that sets the present value of the realized cash flows equal to the price. If instead the
question means “Is the realized rate of return on the investment in the bond and the subsequent reinvest-
ment of the coupons equal to the YTM?” then the answer is definitely “no.” Thus, the question really is
one about strategy and timing. The bond, in combination with a reinvestment strategy, is really two in-
vestments, and clearly the realized rate on this combined strategy depends on the reinvestment rate (see
Web Extension 5C for more on investing for a target future value). For the rest of the book, we assume
that an investment in a bond is just that, an investment only in the bond, and not a combination of the
bond and a reinvestment strategy; this means the investor earns the expected YTM if the bond is held to
maturity.

Yield to Call
If you purchased a bond that was callable and the company called it, you would not
have the option of holding the bond until it matured. Therefore, the yield to matu-
rity would not be earned. For example, if MicroDrive’s 10% coupon bonds were call-
able and if interest rates fell from 10% to 5%, then the company could call in the
10% bonds, replace them with 5% bonds, and save $100 −$50 = $50 interest per
bond per year. This would be good for the company but not for the bondholders.
If current interest rates are well below an outstanding bond’s coupon rate, then a
callable bond is likely to be called, and investors will estimate its expected rate of re-
turn as the yield to call (YTC) rather than as the yield to maturity. To calculate the
YTC, solve this equation for rd:
Price of callable bond ¼∑
N
t¼1
INT
ð1 þ rdÞt þ Call price
ð1 þ rdÞN
(5-4)
Here N is the number of years until the company can call the bond, rd is the YTC,
and “Call price” is the price the company must pay in order to call the bond (it is
often set equal to the par value plus 1 year’s interest).
To illustrate, suppose MicroDrive’s bonds had a provision that permitted the
company, if it desired, to call the bonds 10 years after the issue date at a price of
$1,100. Suppose further that 1 year after issuance the going interest rate had de-
clined, causing the price of the bonds to rise to $1,494.93. Here is the time line and
the setup for finding the bond’s YTC with a financial calculator:

Inputs:
The YTC is 4.21%—this is the return you would earn if you bought the bond at a
price of $1,494.93 and it was called 9 years from today. (The bond could not be
called until 10 years after issuance, and 1 year has gone by, so there are 9 years left
until the first call date.)
Do you think MicroDrive will call the bonds when they become callable? Mi-
croDrive’s actions depend on the going interest rate when the bonds become callable.
If the going rate remains at rd = 5%, then MicroDrive could save 10% −5% = 5%,
or $50 per bond per year, by calling them and replacing the 10% bonds with a new
5% issue. There would be costs to the company to refund the issue, but the interest
savings would probably be worth the cost, so MicroDrive would probably refund the
bonds. Therefore, you would probably earn YTC = 4.21% rather than YTM = 5% if
you bought the bonds under the indicated conditions.
In the balance of this chapter, we assume that bonds are not callable unless other-
wise noted. However, some of the end-of-chapter problems deal with yield to call.

Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

Current Yield
If you examine brokerage house reports on bonds, you will often see reference to a
bond’s current yield. The current yield is the annual interest payment divided by the
bond’s current price. For example, if MicroDrive’s bonds with a 10% coupon were
currently selling at $985, then the bond’s current yield would be $100/$985 =
0.1015 = 10.15%.
Unlike the yield to maturity, the current yield does not represent the rate of re-
turn that investors should expect on the bond. The current yield provides informa-
tion regarding the amount of cash income that a bond will generate in a given year,
but it does not provide an accurate measure of the bond’s total expected return, the
yield to maturity. In fact, here is the relation between current yield, capital gains
yield (which can be negative for a capital loss), and the yield to maturity:
Current yield þ Capital gains yield ¼ Yield to maturity
(5-5)
The Cost of Debt and Intrinsic Value
The “Intrinsic Value Box” at the beginning of this chapter highlights the cost of
debt, which affects the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which in turn af-
fects the company’s intrinsic value. The pre-tax cost of debt from the company’s per-
spective is the required return from the debtholder’s perspective. Therefore, the pre-
tax cost of debt is the yield to maturity (or the yield to call if a call is likely). But why
do different bonds have different yields to maturity? The following sections answer
this question.
Self-Test
Explain the difference between the yield to maturity and the yield to call.
How does a bond’s current yield differ from its total return?
Could the current yield exceed the total return?
A bond currently sells for $850. It has an 8-year maturity, an annual coupon of $80,
and a par value of $1,000. What is its yield to maturity? (10.90%) What is its current
yield? (9.41%)
A bond currently sells for $1,250. It pays a $110 annual coupon and has a 20-year
maturity, but it can be called in 5 years at $1,110. What are its YTM and its YTC?
(8.38%, 6.85%) Is the bond likely to be called if interest rates don’t change?
5.7 THE PRE-TAX COST OF DEBT: DETERMINANTS
OF MARKET INTEREST RATES
Up until now we have given you rd, the going market rate. But as we showed in
Chapter 1, different debt securities often have very different market rates. What ex-
plains these differences? In general, the quoted (or nominal) interest rate on a debt
security, rd, is composed of a real risk-free rate of interest, r*, plus several premiums
that reflect inflation, the risk of the security, and the security’s marketability (or li-
quidity). A conceptual framework is shown below:
Quoted market interest rate ¼ rd ¼ r þ IP þ DRP þ LP þ MRP
¼ rRF þ DRP þ LP þ MRP
(5-6)
Chapter 5: Bonds, Bond Valuation, and Interest Rates

Here are definitions of the variables in Equation 5-6:
We discuss the components whose sum makes up the quoted, or nominal, rate on
a given security in the following sections.
Self-Test
Write out an equation for the nominal interest rate on any debt security.
5.8 THE REAL RISK-FREE RATE OF INTEREST, r*
The real risk-free rate of interest, r*, is defined as the interest rate that would exist
on a riskless security if no inflation were expected, and it may be thought of as the
rate of interest on short-term U.S. Treasury securities in an inflation-free world.
The real risk-free rate is not static—it changes over time depending on economic
rd = Quoted, or nominal, rate of interest on a given security.11 There are
many different securities and hence many different quoted interest rates.
r* = Real risk-free rate of interest. Pronounced “r-star,” r* is the rate that
would exist on a riskless security if zero inflation were expected.
IP = Inflation premium, which is equal to the average expected inflation rate
over the life of the security. The expected future inflation rate is not
necessarily equal to the current inflation rate, so IP is not necessarily
equal to current inflation.
rRF = r* + IP, and it is the quoted risk-free rate of interest on a security such
as a U.S. Treasury bill, which is very liquid and also free of most risks.
Note that rRF includes the premium for expected inflation because
rRF = r* + IP.
DRP = Default risk premium. This premium reflects the possibility that the
issuer will not pay interest or principal at the stated time and in the
stated amount. The DRP is zero for U.S. Treasury securities, but it rises
as the riskiness of issuers increases.
LP = Liquidity, or marketability, premium. This is a premium charged by
lenders to reflect the fact that some securities cannot be converted to
cash on short notice at a “reasonable” price. The LP is very low for
Treasury securities and for securities issued by large, strong firms, but it
is relatively high on securities issued by very small firms.
MRP = Maturity risk premium. As we will explain later, longer-term bonds
(even Treasury bonds) are exposed to a significant risk of price declines,
and a maturity risk premium is charged by lenders to reflect this risk.
11The term nominal as it is used here means the stated rate as opposed to the real rate, which is adjusted
to remove inflation effects. Suppose you bought a 10-year Treasury bond with a quoted, or nominal,
rate of about 4.6%. If inflation averages 2.5% over the next 10 years, then the real rate would be about
4.6% −2.5% = 2.1%. To be technically correct, we should find the real rate by solving for r* in the fol-
lowing equation: (1 + r*)(1 + 0.025) = (1 + 0.046). Solving the equation, we find r* = 2.05%. Since this is
very close to the 2.1% just calculated, we will continue to approximate the real rate in this chapter by sub-
tracting inflation from the nominal rate.

conditions, especially (1) the rate of return corporations and other borrowers expect
to earn on productive assets and (2) people’s time preferences for current versus fu-
ture consumption.12
In addition to its regular bond offerings, in 1997 the U.S. Treasury began issuing
indexed bonds, with payments linked to inflation. These bonds are called TIPS,
short for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. Because the payments (includ-
ing the principal) are tied to inflation, the yield on TIPS is a good estimate of the
risk-free rate. In early 2009, the TIPS with about 1 year remaining until maturity
had a 1.54% yield.13 This is a pretty good estimate of the real risk-free rate, r*, al-
though ideally we would prefer a TIPS with an even shorter time until maturity. We
will have more to say about how to use TIPS when we discuss the inflation premium
in the next section. For details on how TIPS are adjusted to protect against inflation,
see Web Extension 5B on the textbook’s Web site.
Self-Test
What security provides a good estimate of the real risk-free rate?
5.9 THE INFLATION PREMIUM (IP)
Inflation has a major effect on interest rates because it erodes the purchasing power
of the dollar and lowers the real rate of return on investments. To illustrate, suppose
you invest $3,000 in a default-free zero coupon bond that matures in 1 year and pays
a 5% interest rate. At the end of the year, you will receive $3,150—your original
$3,000 plus $150 of interest. Now suppose that the inflation rate during the year is
10% and that it affects all items equally. If gas had cost $3 per gallon at the begin-
ning of the year, it would cost $3.30 at the end of the year. Therefore, your $3,000
would have bought $3,000/$3 = 1,000 gallons at the beginning of the year but only
$3,150/$3.30 = 955 gallons at the end. In real terms, you would be worse off—you
would receive $150 of interest, but it would not be sufficient to offset inflation. You
would thus be better off buying 1,000 gallons of gas (or some other storable asset)
than buying the default-free bond.
Investors are well aware of inflation’s effects on interest rates, so when they lend
money, they build in an inflation premium (IP) equal to the average expected infla-
tion rate over the life of the security. For a short-term, default-free U.S. Treasury
bill, the actual interest rate charged, rT-bill, would be the real risk-free rate, r*, plus
the inflation premium (IP):
rT-bill ¼ rRF ¼ r þ IP
12The real rate of interest as discussed here is different from the current real rate as often discussed in the
press. The current real rate is often estimated as the current interest rate minus the current (or most re-
cent) inflation rate, whereas the real rate, as used here (and in the fields of finance and economics gener-
ally) without the word “current,” is the current interest rate minus the expected future inflation rate over
the life of the security. For example, suppose the current quoted rate for a 1-year Treasury bill is 5%, in-
flation during the previous year was 2%, and inflation expected for the coming year is 4%. Then the cur-
rent real rate would be approximately 5% – 2% = 3%, but the expected real rate would be approximately
5% – 4% = 1%.
13Negative nominal rates are pretty much impossible—investors would just hold cash instead of investing
in a negative-rate bond. But negative real rates are possible. In spring 2008, the combination of stagnant
economic growth, a high level of investor uncertainty, fears of inflation, and the Federal Reserve’s reduc-
tion in nominal short-term interest rates caused the real rate to fall below zero, as measured by negative
yields on several short-term TIPS.
Chapter 5: Bonds, Bond Valuation, and Interest Rates
193

Therefore, if the real short-term risk-free rate of interest were r* = 0.6% and if
inflation were expected to be 1.0% (and hence IP = 1.0%) during the next year,
then the quoted rate of interest on 1-year T-bills would be 0.6% + 1.0% = 1.6%.
It is important to note that the inflation rate built into interest rates is the inflation
rate expected in the future, not the rate experienced in the past. Thus, the latest re-
ported figures might show an annual inflation rate of 2%, but that is for the past
year. If people on average expect a 6% inflation rate in the future, then 6% would
be built into the current interest rate.
Note also that the inflation rate reflected in the quoted interest rate on any secu-
rity is the average rate of inflation expected over the security’s life. Thus, the inflation rate
built into a 1-year bond is the expected inflation rate for the next year, but the infla-
tion rate built into a 30-year bond is the average rate of inflation expected over the
next 30 years. If It is the expected inflation during year t, then the inflation premium
for an N-year bond’s yield (IPN) can be approximated as
IPN ¼ I1 þ I2 þ … þ IN
N
(5-7)
For example, if investors expect inflation to average 3% during Year 1 and 5% dur-
ing Year 2, then the inflation premium built into a 2-year bond’s yield can be approx-
imated by14
IP2 ¼ I1 þ I2
2
¼ 3% þ 5%
2
¼ 4%
In the previous section, we saw that the yield on an inflation-indexed Treasury bond
(TIPS) is a good estimate of the real interest rate. We can also use TIPS to estimate
inflation premiums. For example, in early 2009 the yield on a 5-year nonindexed
T-bond was 1.91% and the yield on a 5-year TIPS was 1.41%. Thus, the 5-year infla-
tion premium was 1.91% −1.41% = 0.50%, implying that investors expected inflation
to average 0.50% over the next 5 years.15 Similarly, the rate on a 20-year nonindexed
T-bond was 3.93% and the rate on a 20-year indexed T-bond was 2.44%. Thus, the
20-year inflation premium was approximately 3.93% −2.44% = 1.49%, implying that
investors expected inflation to average 1.49% over the long term.16 These calculations
are summarized below:
14To be theoretically correct, we should take the geometric average: (1 + IP2)2 = (1 + I1)(1 + I2). In this ex-
ample, we have (1 + IP2)2 = (1 + 0.03)(1 + 0.05). Solving for IP2 yields 3.9952, which is close to our ap-
proximation of 4%.
15To be theoretically precise, we should use a geometric average by solving the following equation:
(1 + IP)(1.0141) = 1.0191. Solving for IP gives IP = 0.493%, which is the same as our approximation.
Note, though, that the difference in yield between a T-bond and a TIPS of the same maturity reflects
both the expected inflation and any risk premium for bearing inflation risk. So the difference in yields is
really an upper limit on the expected inflation.
16There are several other sources for the estimated inflation premium. The Congressional Budget Office
regularly updates the estimates of inflation that it uses in its forecasted budgets; see http://www.cbo.gov/;
select Economic Projections. A second source is the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Re-
search, which regularly polls consumers regarding their expectations for price increases during the next
year; see http://www.isr.umich.edu/home/; select Inst for Social Research; then search for Consumers
to get the survey.
We prefer using inflation premiums derived from indexed and nonindexed Treasury securities, as de-
scribed in the text, since these are based on how investors actually spend their money, not on theoretical
models or opinions.
194
Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

Expectations for future inflation are closely, but not perfectly, correlated with rates
experienced in the recent past. Therefore, if the inflation rate reported for last month
increases, people often raise their expectations for future inflation, and this change in
expectations will cause an increase in interest rates.
Note that Germany, Japan, and Switzerland have, over the past several years, had
lower inflation rates than the United States, so their interest rates have generally
been lower than ours. South Africa, Brazil, and most South American countries
have experienced higher inflation, which is reflected in their interest rates.

5.10 THE NOMINAL, OR QUOTED, RISK-FREE
RATE OF INTEREST, rRF
The nominal, or quoted, risk-free rate, rRF, is the real risk-free rate plus a pre-
mium for expected inflation: rRF = r* + IP. To be strictly correct, the risk-free rate
should mean the interest rate on a totally risk-free security—one that has no risk of
default, no maturity risk, no liquidity risk, no risk of loss if inflation increases, and no
risk of any other type. There is no such security, so there is no observable truly risk-
free rate. When the term “risk-free rate” is used without either the modifier “real” or
the modifier “nominal,” people generally mean the quoted (nominal) rate, and we
will follow that convention in this book. Therefore, when we use the term “risk-free
rate, rRF,” we mean the nominal risk-free rate, which includes an inflation premium
equal to the average expected inflation rate over the life of the security. In general,
we use the T-bill rate to approximate the short-term risk-free rate and use the
T-bond rate to approximate the long-term risk-free rate (even though it also includes
a maturity premium). So, whenever you see the term “risk-free rate,” assume that we
are referring either to the quoted U.S. T-bill rate or to the quoted T-bond rate.
Since rRF = r* + IP, we can express the quoted rate as
Nominal; or quoted; rate ¼ rd ¼ rRF þ DRP þ LP þ MRP(5-7)

What security is a good approximation of the nominal risk-free rate?
5.11 THE DEFAULT RISK PREMIUM (DRP)
If the issuer defaults on a payment, investors receive less than the promised return on
the bond. The quoted interest rate includes a default risk premium (DRP)—the
greater the default risk, the higher the bond’s yield to maturity.17 The default risk

17Suppose two bonds have the same promised cash flows, coupon rate, maturity, liquidity, and inflation
exposure, but one bond has more default risk than the other. Investors will naturally pay less for the
bond with the greater chance of default. As a result, bonds with higher default risk will have higher inter-
est rates.

on Treasury securities is virtually zero, but default risk can be substantial for corporate
and municipal bonds. In this section, we consider some issues related to default risk.
Bond Contract Provisions That Influence Default Risk
Default risk is affected by both the financial strength of the issuer and the terms of
the bond contract, especially whether collateral has been pledged to secure the bond.
Several types of contract provisions are discussed next.
Bond Indentures.
An indenture is a legal document that spells out the rights of
both bondholders and the issuing corporation, and a trustee is an official (usually a
bank) who represents the bondholders and makes sure the terms of the indenture are
carried out. The indenture may be several hundred pages in length, and it will in-
clude restrictive covenants that cover such points as the conditions under which
the issuer can pay off the bonds prior to maturity, the levels at which certain ratios
must be maintained if the company is to issue additional debt, and restrictions against
the payment of dividends unless earnings meet certain specifications.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (1) approves indentures and (2) makes
sure that all indenture provisions are met before allowing a company to sell new se-
curities to the public. A firm will have different indentures for each of the major
types of bonds it issues, but a single indenture covers all bonds of the same type.
For example, one indenture will cover a firm’s first mortgage bonds, another its de-
bentures, and a third its convertible bonds.
Mortgage Bonds.
A corporation pledges certain assets as security for a mortgage
bond. The company might also choose to issue second-mortgage bonds secured by the
same assets that were secured by a previously issued mortgage bond. In the event of liq-
uidation, the holders of these second mortgage bonds would have a claim against the
property, but only after the first mortgage bondholders had been paid off in full. Thus,
second mortgages are sometimes called junior mortgages, because they are junior in pri-
ority to the claims of senior mortgages, or first-mortgage bonds. All mortgage bonds are
subject to an indenture that usually limits the amount of new bonds that can be issued.
Debentures and Subordinated Debentures.
A debenture is an unsecured bond,
and as such it provides no lien against specific property as security for the obligation.
Debenture holders are, therefore, general creditors whose claims are protected by
property not otherwise pledged.
The term subordinate means “below,” or “inferior to"; thus, in the event of bank-
ruptcy, subordinated debt has claims on assets only after senior debt has been paid
off. Subordinated debentures may be subordinated either to designated notes pay-
able (usually bank loans) or to all other debt. In the event of liquidation or reorgani-
zation, holders of subordinated debentures cannot be paid until all senior debt, as
named in the debentures’ indentures, has been paid.
Development Bonds.
Some companies may be in a position to benefit from the
sale of either development bonds or pollution control bonds. State and local
governments may set up both industrial development agencies and pollution control
agencies. These agencies are allowed, under certain circumstances, to sell tax-
exempt bonds and then make the proceeds available to corporations for specific
uses deemed (by Congress) to be in the public interest. For example, a Detroit
pollution control agency might sell bonds to provide Ford with funds for pur-
chasing pollution control equipment. Because the income from the bonds would
be tax exempt, the bonds would have a relatively low interest rates. Note, how-
196
Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

ever, that these bonds are guaranteed by the corporation that will use the funds,
not by a governmental unit, so their rating reflects the credit strength of the cor-
poration using the funds.
Municipal Bond Insurance.
Municipalities can have their bonds insured, which
means that an insurance company guarantees to pay the coupon and principal payments
should the issuer default. This reduces risk to investors, who will thus accept a lower
coupon rate for an insured bond than for a comparable but uninsured one. Even though
the municipality must pay a fee to have its bonds insured, its savings due to the lower
coupon rate often make insurance cost effective. Keep in mind that the insurers are pri-
vate companies, and the value added by the insurance depends on the creditworthiness
of the insurer. The larger insurers are strong companies, and their own ratings are AAA.
Bond Ratings
Since the early 1900s, bonds have been assigned quality ratings that reflect their
probability of going into default. The three major rating agencies are Moody’s Inves-
tors Service (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P), and Fitch Ratings. As
shown in Columns (3) and (4) of Table 5-1, triple-A and double-A bonds are ex-
tremely safe, rarely defaulting even within 5 years of being assigned a rating. Single-
A and triple-B bonds are also strong enough to be called investment-grade bonds,
and they are the lowest-rated bonds that many banks and other institutional investors
are permitted by law to hold. Double-B and lower bonds are speculative, or junk
bonds. These bonds have a significant probability of defaulting.
Bond Rating Criteria, Upgrades, and Downgrades
Bond ratings are based on both quantitative and qualitative factors, as we describe below.
1. Financial Ratios. Many ratios potentially are important, but the return on assets,
debt ratio, and interest coverage ratio are particularly valuable for predicting fi-
nancial distress. For example, Columns 5 and 6 in Table 5-1 show a strong rela-
tionship between ratings and the return on capital and the debt ratio.
2. Bond Contract Terms. Important provisions for determining the bond’s rating
include whether the bond is secured by a mortgage on specific assets, whether the
bond is subordinated to other debt, any sinking fund provisions, guarantees by
some other party with a high credit ranking, and restrictive covenants such as re-
quirements that the firm keep its debt ratio below a given level or that it keep
its times interest earned ratio above a given level.
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
Insuring with Credit Default Swaps: Let the Buyer Beware!
Recall that a credit default swap (CDS) is like an in-
surance policy. The purchaser of the CDS agrees to
make annual payments to a counterparty that agrees
to pay if a particular bond defaults. During the 2000s,
investment banks often would purchase CDS for the
mortgage-backed securities (MBS) they were creating
in order to make the securities more attractive to in-
vestors. But how good was this type of insurance?
As it turned out, not very. For example, Lehman
Brothers might have bought a CDS from AIG in order
to sell a Lehman-created MBS to an investor. But
when the MBS began defaulting, neither Lehman
nor AIG was capable of making full restitution to the
investor.
Chapter 5: Bonds, Bond Valuation, and Interest Rates

3. Qualitative Factors. Included here would be such factors as sensitivity of the firm’s
earnings to the strength of the economy, how it is affected by inflation, whether it is
having or is likely to have labor problems, the extent of its international operations
(including the stability of the countries in which it operates), potential environmen-
tal problems, potential antitrust problems, and so on. Today (2009), a critical factor
is exposure to sub-prime loans, including the difficulty of determining the extent of
this exposure owing to the complexity of the assets backed by such loans.
Rating agencies review outstanding bonds on a periodic basis and re-rate if neces-
sary. Columns (7) and (8) in Table 5-1 show the percentages of companies in each
rating category that were downgraded or upgraded in 2008 by Fitch Ratings. The
year 2008 was a difficult one, as more bonds were downgraded than upgraded.
Over the long run, ratings agencies have done a reasonably good job of measuring
the average credit risk of bonds and of changing ratings whenever there is a signifi-
cant change in credit quality. However, it is important to understand that ratings do
not adjust immediately to changes in credit quality, and in some cases there can be a
considerable lag between a change in credit quality and a change in rating. For exam-
ple, Enron’s bonds still carried an investment-grade rating on a Friday in December
2001, but the company declared bankruptcy two days later, on Sunday. Many other
abrupt downgrades occurred in 2007 and 2008, leading to calls by Congress and the
SEC for changes in rating agencies and the way they rate bonds. Clearly, improve-
ments can be made, but there will always be occasions when completely unexpected
information about a company is released, leading to a sudden change in its rating.

Notes:
aThe ratings agencies also use “modifiers” for bonds rated below triple-A. S&P and Fitch use a plus and minus
system; thus, A+ designates the strongest A-rated bonds and A−the weakest. Moody’s uses a 1, 2, or 3 designation,
with 1 denoting the strongest and 3 the weakest; thus, within the double-A category, Aa1 is the best, Aa2 is average,
and Aa3 is the weakest.

Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

Bond Ratings and the Default Risk Premium
Why are bond ratings so important? First, most bonds are purchased by institutional
investors rather than individuals, and many institutions are restricted to investment-
grade securities. Thus, if a firm’s bonds fall below BBB, it will have a difficult time
selling new bonds because many potential purchasers will not be allowed to buy
them. Second, many bond covenants stipulate that the coupon rate on the bond au-
tomatically increases if the rating falls below a specified level. Third, because a bond’s
rating is an indicator of its default risk, the rating has a direct, measurable influence
on the bond’s yield. Column (9) of Table 5-1 shows that a AAA bond has a yield of
5.50% and that yields increase as the rating falls. In fact, an investor would earn
26.3% on a CCC bond if it didn’t default!
A bond spread is the difference between a bond’s yield and the yield on some
other security of the same maturity. Unless specified differently, the term “spread”
generally means the difference between a bond’s yield and the yield on a Treasury
bond of similar maturity.
Figure 5-3 shows the spreads between an index of AAA bonds and a 10-year Trea-
sury bond; it also shows spreads for an index of BBB bonds relative to the T-bond.
Figure 5-3 illustrates three important points. First, the BAA spread always is greater
than the AAA spread. This is because a BAA bond is riskier than an AAA bond, so
BAA investors require extra compensation for their extra risk. The same is true for
other ratings: Lower-rated bonds have higher yields.
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
Might the U.S. Treasury Bond Be Downgraded?
The worsening recession that began at the end of 2007
led Congress to pass a huge economic stimulus pack-
age in early 2009. The combination of the stimulus
package and the government’s bailouts of financial in-
stitutions is causing the U.S. government to increase its
borrowing. Moody’s, the bond rating agency, projects
that federal debt will rise from $5.8 trillion (41% of
GDP) at the beginning of 2009 to $9 trillion (62% of
GDP) by the end of 2010. This is a lot of money, even
by Washington standards!
Moody’s rates sovereign debt as well as corpo-
rate debt, and the United States has always ranked
right at the top. However, Moody’s essentially put
America on “credit watch” starting February 13,
2009. Moody’s predicted that the U.S. ranking will
go from the strongest to near the bottom of the
most developed nations’ rankings (Canada, Britain,
France, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries).
It even stated that the U.S.’s “triple A rating isn’t
assured forever."
A downgrade might cause lenders in China and
elsewhere around the globe to sell many of their
T-bonds.
Massive
selling
pressure
would
cause
T-bond interest rates to go up, which would increase
the government’s cost of borrowing. The sellers would
want to convert into their own currency the dollars
they receive from selling T-bonds. This means they
would “sell” dollars for their own currency, and this
selling pressure would cause the value of the dollar
to fall. If the Chinese and others didn’t want to hold
dollar denominated debt, who would buy the extra
$3.2 trillion of bonds the United States must sell to
fund the stimulus package?
A downgrading would also have a huge effect on the
finance profession—we would no longer have a proxy
for the riskless rate, which is an important element of
financial theory and practice. Clearly, though, that
would be a very small problem compared to the dam-
age a downgrade would do to our economy.
Chapter 5: Bonds, Bond Valuation, and Interest Rates

Second, the spreads are not constant over time. For example, look at the AAA
spread. It was exceptionally low during the boom years of 2005–2007 but rose dra-
matically as the economy subsequently declined.
Third, the difference between the BAA spread and the AAA spread isn’t con-
stant over time. The two spreads were quite close to one another in early 2000
but were very far apart in early 2009. In other words, BAA investors didn’t require
much extra return over that of an AAA bond to induce them to take on that extra
risk for most of the decade, but now (2009) they are requiring a very large risk
premium.
Not only do spreads vary with the rating of the security, they also usually increase
as maturity increases. This should make sense. If a bond matures soon, investors are
able to forecast the company’s performance fairly well. But if a bond has a long time
until it matures, investors have a difficult time forecasting the likelihood that the
company will fall into financial distress. This extra uncertainty creates additional
risk, so investors demand a higher required return.

5.12 THE LIQUIDITY PREMIUM (LP)
A “liquid” asset can be converted to cash quickly and at a “fair market value.” Financial
assets are generally more liquid than real assets. Because liquidity is important, investors
include liquidity premiums (LPs) when market rates of securities are established. Al-
though it is difficult to measure liquidity premiums accurately, a differential of at least 2
percentage points (and perhaps up to 4 or 5 percentage points) exists between the least
liquid and the most liquid financial assets of similar default risk and maturity. Corporate
bonds issued by small companies are traded less frequently than those issued by large com-
panies, so small-company bonds tend to have a higher liquidity premium.
As discussed in Chapter 1, liquidity in the market for mortgage-backed securities
evaporated in 2008 and early 2009. The few transactions that occurred were priced
such that the yields on these MBS were extremely high, which was partially due to
a much higher liquidity premium caused by the extremely low liquidity of MBS.
Self-Test
Which bond usually will have a higher liquidity premium: one issued by a large
company or one issued by a small company?
5.13 THE MATURITY RISK PREMIUM (MRP)
All bonds, even Treasury bonds, are exposed to two additional sources of risk: inter-
est rate risk and reinvestment risk. The net effect of these two sources of risk upon a
bond’s yield is called the maturity risk premium, MRP. The following sections ex-
plain how interest rate risk and reinvestment risk affect a bond’s yield.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rates go up and down over time, and an increase in interest rates leads to a
decline in the value of outstanding bonds. This risk of a decline in bond values due to
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
Are Investors Rational?
The figure in this box shows the yield on junk bonds dur-
ing the recent past. Observe that the yields were less than
10% from mid-2003 through the end of 2008. During this
period, 10-year T-bonds yielded an average of about
4.4%. Thus, the spread on junk bonds over Treasuries
was only about 5.4% during these boom years, which is
exceptionally low by historic standards. In other words,
investors had a voracious appetite for risk and simply
didn’t require much extra return to induce them to buy
very risky securities—investors almost ignored risk dur-
ing the boom years. But as the economy began to deteri-
orate in 2008, investors reversed course and became
extremely risk averse, with junk-bond yields climbing as
high as 25% and the spread exceeding 21%. Such drastic
changes in investors’ risk aversion are hard to reconcile
with careful, deliberate, and rational behavior!

rising interest rates is called interest rate risk. To illustrate, suppose you bought
some 10% MicroDrive bonds at a price of $1,000 and then interest rates rose in the
following year to 15%. As we saw earlier, the price of the bonds would fall to
$713.78, so you would have a loss of $286.22 per bond.18 Interest rates can and do
rise, and rising rates cause a loss of value for bondholders. Thus, bond investors are
exposed to risk from changing interest rates.
One’s exposure to interest rate risk is higher on bonds with long maturities than
on those maturing in the near future.19 This point can be demonstrated by showing
how the value of a 1-year bond with a 10% annual coupon fluctuates with changes in
rd and then comparing these changes with those on a 25-year bond. The 1-year
bond’s value for rd = 5% is shown below:

Output (Bond Value):
Inputs:
Using either a calculator or a spreadsheet, you could calculate the bond values for a
1-year and a 25-year bond at several current market interest rates; these results are
plotted in Figure 5-4. Note how much more sensitive the price of the 25-year bond
is to changes in interest rates. At a 10% interest rate, both the 25-year and the 1-year
bonds are valued at $1,000. When rates rise to 15%, the 25-year bond falls to
$676.79 but the 1-year bond falls only to $956.52.
For bonds with similar coupons, this differential sensitivity to changes in interest rates al-
ways holds true: The longer the maturity of the bond, the more its price changes in response to
a given change in interest rates. Thus, even if the risk of default on two bonds is exactly
the same, the one with the longer maturity is exposed to more risk from a rise in
interest rates.
The explanation for this difference in interest rate risk is simple. Suppose you
bought a 25-year bond that yielded 10%, or $100 a year. Now suppose interest rates
on bonds of comparable risk rose to 15%. You would be stuck with only $100 of in-
terest for the next 25 years. On the other hand, had you bought a 1-year bond, you
would have a low return for only 1 year. At the end of the year, you would get your
$1,000 back, and you could then reinvest it and receive a 15% return ($150) for the
next year. Thus, interest rate risk reflects the length of time one is committed to a
given investment.
18You would have an accounting (and tax) loss only if you sold the bond; if you held it to maturity, you
would not have such a loss. However, even if you did not sell, you would still have suffered a real economic
loss in an opportunity cost sense because you would have lost the opportunity to invest at 15% and would be
stuck with a 10% bond in a 15% market. In an economic sense, “paper losses” are just as bad as realized
accounting losses.
19Actually, a bond’s maturity and coupon rate each affect interest rate risk. Low coupons mean that most
of the bond’s return will come from repayment of principal, whereas on a high-coupon bond with the
same maturity, more of the cash flows will come in during the early years because of the relatively large
coupon payments. A measurement called “duration,” which finds the average number of years that the
bond’s PV of cash flows remains outstanding, has been developed to combine maturity and coupons. A
zero coupon bond, which has no interest payments and whose payments all come at maturity, has a dura-
tion equal to the bond’s maturity. Coupon bonds all have durations that are shorter than maturity, and
the higher the coupon rate, the shorter the duration. Bonds with longer duration are exposed to more in-
terest rate risk. Excel’s DURATION function provides an easy way to calculate a bond’s duration. See
Web Extension 5C and Ch05 Tool Kit.xls for more on duration.

Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

Reinvestment Rate Risk
As we saw in the preceding section, an increase in interest rates will hurt bondholders
because it will lead to a decline in the value of a bond portfolio. But can a decrease in
interest rates also hurt bondholders? The answer is “yes,” because if interest rates fall
then a bondholder may suffer a reduction in his or her income. For example, con-
sider a retiree who has a portfolio of bonds and lives off the income they produce.
The bonds, on average, have a coupon rate of 10%. Now suppose that interest rates
decline to 5%. The short-term bonds will mature, and when they do, they will have
to be replaced with lower-yielding bonds. In addition, many of the remaining long-
term bonds may be called, and as calls occur, the bondholder will have to replace
10% bonds with 5% bonds. Thus, our retiree will suffer a reduction of income.
The risk of an income decline due to a drop in interest rates is called reinvest-
ment rate risk. Reinvestment rate risk is obviously high on callable bonds. It is also
high on short-maturity bonds, because the shorter the maturity of a bond, the fewer
the years when the relatively high old interest rate will be earned and the sooner the
funds will have to be reinvested at the new low rate. Thus, retirees whose primary
holdings are short-term securities, such as bank CDs and short-term bonds, are
hurt badly by a decline in rates, but holders of long-term bonds continue to enjoy
their old high rates.
Comparing Interest Rate Risk and Reinvestment Rate Risk:
The Maturity Risk Premium
Note that interest rate risk relates to the value of the bonds in a portfolio, while rein-
vestment rate risk relates to the income the portfolio produces. If you hold long-term
bonds then you will face a lot of interest rate risk, because the value of your bonds
will decline if interest rates rise; but you will not face much reinvestment rate risk,
so your income will be stable. On the other hand, if you hold short-term bonds,

you will not be exposed to much interest rate risk because the value of your portfolio
will be stable, but you will be exposed to considerable reinvestment rate risk because
your income will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. We see, then, that no fixed-
rate bond can be considered totally riskless—even most Treasury bonds are exposed
to both interest rate risk and reinvestment rate risk.20
Bond prices reflect the trading activities of the marginal investors, defined as those
who trade often enough and with large enough sums to determine bond prices. Al-
though one particular investor might be more averse to reinvestment risk than to
interest rate risk, the data suggest that the marginal investor is more averse to in-
terest rate risk than to reinvestment risk. To induce the marginal investor to take
on interest rate risk, long-term bonds must have a higher expected rate of return
than short-term bonds. Holding all else equal, this additional return is the maturity
risk premium (MRP).

5.14 THE TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES
The term structure of interest rates describes the relationship between long-term
and short-term rates. The term structure is important both to corporate treasurers
deciding whether to borrow by issuing long-term or short-term debt and to investors
who are deciding whether to buy long-term or short-term bonds.
Interest rates for bonds with different maturities can be found in a variety of
publications, including The Wall Street Journal and the Federal Reserve Bulletin, as
well as on a number of Web sites, including Bloomberg, Yahoo!, CNN Financial,
and the Federal Reserve Board. Using interest rate data from these sources, we can
determine the term structure at any given point in time. For example, Figure 5-5
presents interest rates for different maturities on three different dates. The set of
data for a given date, when plotted on a graph such as Figure 5-5, is called the yield
curve for that date.
As the figure shows, the yield curve changes both in position and in slope over
time. In March 1980, all rates were quite high because high inflation was expected.
However, the rate of inflation was expected to decline, so the inflation premium
(IP) was larger for short-term bonds than for long-term bonds. This caused short-
term yields to be higher than long-term yields, resulting in a downward-sloping yield
curve. By February 2000, inflation had indeed declined and thus all rates were lower.
The yield curve had become humped—medium-term rates were higher than either
short- or long-term rates. By March 2009, all rates had fallen below the 2000 levels.
Because short-term rates had dropped below long-term rates, the yield curve was up-
ward sloping.
Historically, long-term rates are generally higher than short-term rates owing to
the maturity risk premium, so the yield curve usually slopes upward. For this reason,
people often call an upward-sloping yield curve a “normal” yield curve and a yield
20Although indexed Treasury bonds are almost riskless, they pay a relatively low real rate. Note also that
risks have not disappeared—they have simply been transferred from bondholders to taxpayers.

curve that slopes downward an inverted, or “abnormal,” curve. Thus, in Figure 5-5
the yield curve for March 1980 was inverted whereas the yield curve in March 2009
was normal. As stated above, the February 2000 curve was humped.
A few academics and practitioners contend that large bond traders who buy and
sell securities of different maturities each day dominate the market. According to
this view, a bond trader is just as willing to buy a 30-year bond to pick up a short-
term profit as to buy a 3-month security. Strict proponents of this view argue that the
shape of the yield curve is therefore determined only by market expectations about
future interest rates, a position that is called the pure expectations theory, or some-
times just the expectations theory. If this were true, then the maturity risk premium
(MRP) would be zero and long-term interest rates would simply be a weighted aver-
age of current and expected future short-term interest rates. See Web Extension 5D
for a more detailed discussion of the expectations theory.
Self-Test
What is a yield curve, and what information would you need to draw this curve?
Distinguish among the shapes of a “normal” yield curve, an “abnormal” curve, and
a “humped” curve.
If the interest rates on 1-, 5-, 20-, and 30-year bonds are (respectively) 4%, 5%, 6%,
and 7%, then how would you describe the yield curve? How would you describe it if
the rates were reversed?
5.15 FINANCING WITH JUNK BONDS
Recall that bonds rated less than BBB are noninvestment-grade debt, also called
junk bonds or high-yield debt. There are two ways that a bond can become a junk
bond. First, the bond might have been investment-grade debt when it was issued
but its rating declined because the issuing corporation had fallen on hard times.
Such bonds are called “fallen angels,” and there are many such bonds as we write
this in 2009.

Some bonds are junk bonds at the time they are issued, but this was not always
true. Prior to the 1980s, fixed-income investors such as pension funds and insurance
companies were generally unwilling to buy risky bonds, so it was almost impossible
for risky companies to raise capital in the public bond markets. Then, in the late
1970s, Michael Milken of the investment banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert, re-
lying on historical studies that showed risky bonds yielded more than enough to
compensate for their risk, convinced institutional investors that junk bond yields
were worth their risk. Thus was born the junk bond market.
In the 1980s, large investors like T. Boone Pickens and Henry Kravis thought that
certain old-line, established companies were run inefficiently and were financed too
conservatively. These corporate raiders were able to put in some of their own money,
borrow the rest via junk bonds, and take over the target company, usually taking the
company private. The fact that interest on the bonds was tax deductible, combined
with the much higher debt ratios of the restructured firms, also increased after-tax
cash flows and helped make the deals feasible. Because these deal used lots of debt,
they were called leveraged buyouts (LBOs).
In recent years, private equity firms have conducted transactions very similar to the
LBOs of the 1980s, taking advantage of historically low junk-bond rates to help finance
their purchases. For example, in 2007 the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
and Company (KKR) took the discount retailer Dollar General private in a $6.9 billion
deal. As part of the transaction, Dollar General issued $1.9 billion in junk bonds. So
KKR financed approximately 73% of the deal with its own cash (coming from its own
equity and from money it had borrowed on its own account) and about 27% of the deal
with money that Dollar General raised. Dollar General’s sales have been soaring during
the early part of the current recession, making KKR’s purchase look like a winner.

5.16 BANKRUPTCY AND REORGANIZATION
When a business becomes insolvent, it does not have enough cash to meet its interest
and principal payments. A decision must then be made whether to dissolve the firm
through liquidation or to permit it to reorganize and thus stay alive. These issues are
addressed in Chapters 7 and 11 of the federal bankruptcy statutes, and the final deci-
sion is made by a federal bankruptcy court judge.
The decision to force a firm to liquidate versus permit it to reorganize depends on
whether the value of the reorganized firm is likely to be greater than the value of the
firm’s assets if they are sold off piecemeal. In a reorganization, the firm’s creditors ne-
gotiate with management on the terms of a potential reorganization. The reorganiza-
tion plan may call for a restructuring of the firm’s debt, in which case the interest rate
may be reduced, the term to maturity lengthened, or some of the debt may be ex-
changed for equity. The point of the restructuring is to reduce the financial charges
to a level that the firm’s cash flows can support. Of course, the common stockholders
also have to give up something: they often see their position diluted as a result of addi-
tional shares being given to debtholders in exchange for accepting a reduced amount of
debt principal and interest. In fact, the original common stockholders often end up
with nothing. A trustee may be appointed by the court to oversee the reorganization,
but generally the existing management is allowed to retain control.
Liquidation occurs if the company is deemed to be too far gone to be saved—if it
is worth more dead than alive. If the bankruptcy court orders liquidation, then
assets are sold off and the cash obtained is distributed as specified in Chapter 7 of
206
Part 2: Fixed Income Securities

the Bankruptcy Act. Here is the priority of claims: (1) past-due property taxes;
(2) secured creditors who are entitled to the proceeds from the sale of collateral;
(3) the trustee’s costs of administering and operating the bankrupt firm; (4) expenses
incurred after bankruptcy was filed; (5) wages due workers, up to a limit of $2,000
per worker; (6) claims for unpaid contributions to employee benefit plans (with wages
and claims not to exceed $2,000 per worker); (7) unsecured claims for customer de-
posits up to $900 per customer; (8) federal, state, and local taxes due; (9) unfunded
pension plan liabilities (although some limitations exist); (10) general unsecured cred-
itors; (11) preferred stockholders (up to the par value of their stock); and (12) com-
mon stockholders (although usually nothing is left).
The key points for you to know are: (1) the federal bankruptcy statutes govern both
reorganization and liquidation, (2) bankruptcies occur frequently, and (3) a priority of
the specified claims must be followed when distributing the assets of a liquidated firm.

Summary
This chapter described the different types of bonds that governments and corpora-
tions issue, explained how bond prices are established, and discussed how investors
estimate the rates of return they can expect to earn. The rate of return required by
debtholders is the company’s pre-tax cost of debt, and this rate depends on the risk
that investors face when they buy bonds.
•
A bond is a long-term promissory note issued by a business or governmental
unit. The issuer receives money in exchange for promising to make interest
payments and to repay the principal on a specified future date.
•
Some special types of long-term financing include zero coupon bonds, which
pay no annual interest but are issued at a discount; see Web Extension 5A for
more on zero coupon bonds. Other types are floating-rate debt, whose interest
payments fluctuate with changes in the general level of interest rates; and junk
bonds, which are high-risk, high-yield instruments issued by firms that use a
great deal of financial leverage.
•
A call provision gives the issuing corporation the right to redeem the bonds
prior to maturity under specified terms, usually at a price greater than the
maturity value (the difference is a call premium). A firm will typically call
a bond if interest rates fall substantially below the coupon rate.
•
A sinking fund is a provision that requires the corporation to retire a portion of
the bond issue each year. The purpose of the sinking fund is to provide for the
orderly retirement of the issue. A sinking fund typically requires no call premium.
•
The value of a bond is found as the present value of an annuity (the interest
payments) plus the present value of a lump sum (the principal). The bond is
evaluated at the appropriate periodic interest rate over the number of periods for
which interest payments are made.
•
The equation used to find the value of an annual coupon bond is
VB ¼∑
N
t¼1
INT
ð1 þ rdÞt þ
M
ð1 þ rdÞN
•
An adjustment to the formula must be made if the bond pays interest semian-
nually: divide INT and rd by 2, and multiply N by 2.

The expected rate of return on a bond held to maturity is defined as the bond’s
yield to maturity (YTM):
Bond price ¼∑
N
t¼1
INT
ð1 þ YTMÞt þ
M
ð1 þ YTMÞN
•
The expected rate of return on a callable bond held to its call date is defined as
the yield to call (YTC).
•
The nominal (or quoted) interest rate on a debt security, rd, is composed of
the real risk-free rate, r*, plus premiums that reflect inflation (IP), default risk
(DRP), liquidity (LP), and maturity risk (MRP):
rd ¼ r þ IP þ DRP þ LP þ MRP
•
The risk-free rate of interest, rRF, is defined as the real risk-free rate, r*, plus
an inflation premium, IP: rRF = r* + IP.
•
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are U.S. Treasury bonds that
have no inflation risk. See Web Extension 5B for more discussion of TIPS.
•
The longer the maturity of a bond, the more its price will change in response to
a given change in interest rates; this is called interest rate risk. However,
bonds with short maturities expose investors to high reinvestment rate risk,
which is the risk that income from a bond portfolio will decline because cash
flows received from bonds will be rolled over at lower interest rates.
•
Duration is a measure of interest rate risk. See Web Extension 5C for a discus-
sion of duration.
•
Corporate and municipal bonds have default risk. If an issuer defaults, investors
receive less than the promised return on the bond. Therefore, investors should
evaluate a bond’s default risk before making a purchase.
•
Bonds are assigned ratings that reflect the probability of their going into default.
The highest rating is AAA, and they go down to D. The higher a bond’s rating,
the lower its risk and therefore its interest rate.
•
The relationship between the yields on securities and the securities’ maturities is
known as the term structure of interest rates, and the yield curve is a graph of
this relationship.
•
The shape of the yield curve depends on two key factors: (1) expectations about
future inflation and (2) perceptions about the relative risk of securities with different
maturities.
•
The yield curve is normally upward sloping—this is called a normal yield
curve. However, the curve can slope downward (an inverted yield curve) if the
inflation rate is expected to decline. The yield curve also can be humped, which
means that interest rates on medium-term maturities are higher than rates on
both short- and long-term maturities.
•
The expectations theory states that yields on long-term bonds reflect expected
future interest rates. Web Extension 5D discusses this theory.

Let’s take a look at several sub-periods.
1996–2000. These years were wonderful for GE, great for the S&P
stocks, and pretty good even for GM. The dramatic increase in P/E ratios
indicated that stock prices were going up more as a result of increasing
expectations than actual earnings, which was a dangerous sign. Alan
Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board at that time, stated
that the market was suffering from “irrational exuberance,” but investors
paid no attention and kept roaring ahead.
2001–2003. Greenspan was right. The bubble started to leak in 2001, the
9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center knocked stocks down
further, and in 2002 fears of another attack plus a recession drove the
market down even more. Those three years cost the average investor
almost 50% of his or her beginning-of-2000 market value. P/E ratios
plunged, reflecting investors’ declining expectations.
2004–2007. Investors had overreacted, so in 2004 the market as
measured by the S&P 500 began a rebound, remaining strong through
2007. The economy was robust, profits were rising rapidly, and the
Federal Reserve encouraged a bull market by cutting interest rates eleven
times. In 2007 the S&P hit an all-time high.
2007–2009. The financial crisis caused by mortgage-backed securities
spilled over into the stock markets and the economy, causing a recession.
After 2009: Bull or Bear? We wish we knew! Investing in stocks can be
quite profitable, but it means bearing risks. The key to smart investing is to
estimate the amount of risk different strategies entail, the returns those
strategies are likely to produce, and your own tolerance for risk. We
address these topics in this chapter.

Part 3: Stocks and Options

In this chapter, we start from the basic premise that investors like returns and dislike
risk. Therefore, people will invest in relatively risky assets only if they expect to receive
relatively high returns—the higher the perceived risk, the higher the expected rate of
return an investor will demand. We define exactly what the term risk means as it re-
lates to investments, we examine procedures used to measure risk, and we discuss
more precisely the relationship between risk and required returns. In later chapters
we extend these relationships to show how risk and return interact to determine secu-
rity prices. Managers must understand and apply these concepts as they plan the ac-
tions that will shape their firms’ futures, and investors must understand them in order
to make appropriate investment decisions.
6.1 RETURNS ON INVESTMENTS
With most investments, an individual or business spends money today with the
expectation of earning even more money in the future. The concept of return pro-
vides investors with a convenient way to express the financial performance of an in-
vestment. To illustrate, suppose you buy 10 shares of a stock for $1,000. The stock
pays no dividends, but at the end of 1 year you sell the stock for $1,100. What is the
return on your $1,000 investment?
Intrinsic Value, Risk, and Return
The intrinsic value of a company is the present value of
its expected future free cash flows (FCF) discounted at
the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). This chap-
ter shows you how to measure a firm’s risk and the rate
of return expected by shareholders, which affects the
weighted average cost of capital (WACC). All else held
equal, higher risk increases the WACC, which reduces
the firm’s value.

Chapter 6: Risk, Return, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model
219

One way to express an investment’s return is in dollar terms:
Dollar return ¼ Amount to be received −Amount invested
¼ $1;100 −$1;000
¼ $100
If at the end of the year you sell the stock for only $900, your dollar return will be
−$100.
Although expressing returns in dollars is easy, two problems arise: (1) to make a mean-
ingful judgment about the return, you need to know the scale (size) of the investment; a
$100 return on a $100 investment is a great return (assuming the investment is held for
1 year), but a $100 return on a $10,000 investment would be a poor return. (2) You also
need to know the timing of the return; a $100 return on a $100 investment is a great
return if it occurs after 1 year, but the same dollar return after 20 years is not very good.
The solution to these scale and timing problems is to express investment results as
rates of return, or percentage returns. For example, the rate of return on the 1-year
stock investment, when $1,100 is received after 1 year, is 10%:
Rate of return ¼ Amount received −Amount invested
Amount invested
¼
Dollar return
Amount invested ¼ $100
$1;000
¼ 0:10 ¼ 10%
The rate of return calculation “standardizes” the dollar return by considering the annual
return per unit of investment. Although this example has only one outflow and one inflow,
the annualized rate of return can easily be calculated in situations where multiple cash
flows occur over time by using time value of money concepts as discussed in Chapter 4.
Self-Test
Differentiate between dollar returns and rates of return.
Why are rates of return superior to dollar returns when comparing different potential
investments? (Hint: Think about size and timing.)
If you pay $500 for an investment that returns $600 in one year, what is your annual
rate of return? (20%)
6.2 STAND-ALONE RISK
Risk is defined in Webster’s as “a hazard; a peril; exposure to loss or injury.” Thus,
risk refers to the chance that some unfavorable event will occur. If you go skydiving,
you are taking a chance with your life—skydiving is risky. If you bet on horse races,
you are risking your money. If you invest in speculative stocks (or, really, any stock),
then you are taking a risk in the hope of earning an appreciable return.
An asset’s risk can be analyzed in two ways: (1) on a stand-alone basis, where the asset is
considered in isolation, and (2) on a portfolio basis, where the asset is held as one of a num-
ber of assets in a portfolio. Thus, an asset’s stand-alone risk is the risk an investor would
face if she held only this one asset. Obviously, most assets are held in portfolios, but it is
necessary to understand stand-alone risk in order to understand risk in a portfolio context.
To begin, suppose an investor buys $100,000 of short-term Treasury bills with an ex-
pected return of 5%. In this case, the rate of return on the investment, 5%, can
be estimated quite precisely, and the investment is defined as being essentially risk free.
However, if the $100,000 were invested in the stock of a company just being organized
to prospect for oil in the mid-Atlantic, then the investment’s return could not be estimated
220
Part 3: Stocks and Options

precisely. One might analyze the situation and conclude that the expected rate of return, in
a statistical sense, is 20%, but the investor should recognize that the actual rate of return
could range from, say, +1,000% to −100%. Because there is a significant danger of actually
earning much less than the expected return, this stock would be relatively risky.
No investment should be undertaken unless the expected rate of return is high enough to
compensate for the perceived risk. In our example, it is clear that few if any investors
would be willing to buy the oil company’s stock if its expected return were 5%, the
same as that of the T-bill.
Risky assets rarely produce their exact expected rates of return; in general, risky as-
sets earn either more or less than was originally expected. Indeed, if assets always pro-
duced their expected returns, they would not be risky. Investment risk, then, is related
to the probability of actually earning a low or negative return: The greater the chance
of a low or negative return, and the larger the potential loss, the riskier the investment.
However, risk can be defined more precisely, and we do so in the next section.
Distributions
An event’s probability is defined as the chance that the event will occur. For example,
a weather forecaster might state: “There is a 40% chance of rain today and a 60%
chance that it will not rain.” If all possible events, or outcomes, are listed, and if a
probability is assigned to each event, then the listing is called a probability distribu-
tion. Keep in mind that the probabilities must sum to 1.0, or 100%.
With this in mind, consider the possible rates of return—due to dividends or stock
price changes—that you might earn next year on a $10,000 investment in the stock of
either Sale.com or Basic Foods Inc. Sale.com is an Internet company that offers deep
discounts on factory seconds and overstocked merchandise. Because it faces intense
competition, its new services may or may not be competitive in the marketplace, so
its future earnings cannot be predicted very well. Indeed, some new company could
develop better services and literally bankrupt Sale.com. Basic Foods, on the other
hand, distributes essential food staples to grocery stores, and its sales and profits are
relatively stable and predictable.
The rate-of-return probability distributions for the two companies are shown in
Figure 6-1. There is a 30% chance of strong demand, in which case both companies
will have high earnings, pay high dividends, and enjoy capital gains. There is a 40%
probability of normal demand and moderate returns and a 30% probability of weak
demand, which will mean low earnings and dividends as well as capital losses. Notice,
however, that Sale.com’s rate of return could vary far more widely than that of Basic
Foods. There is a fairly high probability that the value of Sale.com’s stock will drop
substantially, resulting in a 70% loss, while there is a much smaller possible loss for
Basic Foods.1
Expected Rate of Return
If we multiply each possible outcome by its probability of occurrence and then sum these
products, as in Figure 6-2, the result is a weighted average of outcomes. The weights
are the probabilities, and the weighted average is the expected rate of return, ^r,
called “r-hat.”2 The expected rates of return for both Sale.com and Basic Foods are
shown in Figure 6-2 to be 15%. This type of table is known as a payoff matrix.
1Note that the following discussion of risk applies to all random variables, not just stock returns.
2In other chapters, we will use ^rd and ^rs to signify expected returns on bonds and stocks, respectively.
However, this distinction is unnecessary in this chapter, so we just use the general term, ^r, to signify the
expected return on an investment.
Chapter 6: Risk, Return, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model
221

The calculation for expected rate of return can also be expressed as an equation
that does the same thing as the payoff matrix table:
Expected rate of return ¼^r ¼ P1r1 þ P2r2 þ … þ Pnrn
¼
X
n
i¼1
Piri
(6-1)
Here ri is the return if outcome i occurs, Pi is the probability that outcome i occurs, and
n is the number of possible outcomes. Thus, ^r is a weighted average of the possible out-
comes (the ri values), with each outcome’s weight being its probability of occurrence.
Using the data for Sale.com, we obtain its expected rate of return as follows:
^r ¼ P1ðr1Þ þ P2ðr2Þ þ P3ðr3Þ
¼ 0:3ð90%Þ þ 0:4ð15%Þ þ 0:3ð−60%Þ
¼ 15%
Basic Foods’s expected rate of return is also 15%:
^r ¼ 0:3ð45%Þ þ 0:4ð15%Þ þ 0:3ð−15%Þ
¼ 15%

Part 3: Stocks and Options

We can graph the rates of return to obtain a picture of the variability of possible out-
comes; this is shown in the bar charts of Figure 6-3. The height of each bar signifies the
probability that a given outcome will occur. The range of probable returns for Sale.com
is from −60% to +90%, with an expected return of 15%. The expected return for Basic
Foods is also 15%, but its range is much narrower.
Thus far, we have assumed that only three situations can exist: strong, normal, and
weak demand. Actually, of course, demand could range from a deep depression to a
fantastic boom, and there are unlimited possibilities in between. Suppose we had the
time and patience to assign a probability to each possible level of demand (with the
sum of the probabilities still equaling 1.0) and to assign a rate of return to each stock
for each level of demand. We would have a table similar to Figure 6-2, except it
would have many more entries in each column. This table could be used to calculate
expected rates of return using the same approach as shown previously. In fact, the
probabilities and outcomes could be approximated by continuous curves such as those
presented in Figure 6-4.
The tighter (or more peaked) the probability distribution, the more likely it is that the
actual outcome will be close to the expected value, and hence the less likely it is that the actual
return will end up far below the expected return. Thus, the tighter the probability distribu-
tion, the lower the risk assigned to a stock. Since Basic Foods has a relatively tight prob-
ability distribution, its actual return is likely to be closer to its 15% expected return
than that of Sale.com.
Measuring Stand-Alone Risk: The Standard Deviation
Risk is a difficult concept to grasp, and a great deal of controversy has surrounded
attempts to define and measure it. However, a common definition that is satisfactory
for many purposes is stated in terms of probability distributions such as those pre-
sented in Figure 6-4: The tighter the probability distribution of expected future returns,
the smaller the risk of a given investment. According to this definition, Basic Foods is

less risky than Sale.com because there is a smaller chance that its actual return will
end up far below its expected return.
To be most useful, any measure of risk should have a definite value—we need a
measure of the tightness of the probability distribution. One such measure is the
standard deviation, the symbol for which is σ, pronounced “sigma.” The smaller
the standard deviation, the tighter the probability distribution and, accordingly, the
less risky the stock. To calculate the standard deviation, we proceed as shown in
Figure 6-5, taking the following steps.3
1. Calculate the expected rate of return:
Expected rate of return ¼ ^r ¼
X
n
i¼1
Piri
For Sale.com, we previously found ^r = 15%.
2. Subtract the expected rate of return (^r) from each possible outcome (ri) to obtain
a set of deviations about ^r as shown in Column 4 of Figure 6-5:
Deviationi ¼ ri −^r

Probability Density
Note: The assumptions regarding the probabilities of various outcomes have been changed from those in Figure 6-3.
There the probability of obtaining exactly 15% was 40%; here it is much smaller because there are many possible
outcomes instead of just three. With continuous distributions, it is more appropriate to ask what the probability is of
obtaining at least some specified rate of return than to ask what the probability is of achieving exactly that rate. This
topic is covered in detail in statistics courses.
3These equations are valid for any random variable from a discrete probability distribution, not just for
returns.
224
Part 3: Stocks and Options

3. Square each deviation as shown in Column 5. Then multiply the squared devia-
tions in Column 5 by the probability of occurrence for its related outcome; these
products are shown in Column 6. Sum these products to obtain the variance of
the probability distribution:
Variance ¼ σ2 ¼
X
n

ðri −^rÞ2Pi

4. Finally, find the square root of the variance to obtain the standard deviation:

Thus, the standard deviation is essentially a weighted average of the deviations
from the expected value, and it provides an idea of how far above or below the
expected value the actual value is likely to be. If we use this procedure, Sale.com’s
standard deviation is seen in Figure 6-5 to be σ = 58.09%; we likewise find Basic
Foods’s standard deviation to be 23.24%. Sale.com has the larger standard deviation,

which indicates a greater variation of returns and thus a greater chance that the actual
return will turn out to be substantially lower than the expected return. Therefore,
Sale.com is a riskier investment than Basic Foods when held alone.4
If we have a normal distribution, then the actual return will be within ±1
standard deviation of the expected return 68.26% of the time. Figure 6-6 illus-
trates this point, and it also shows the situation for ±2σ and ±3σ. For Sale.com, ^r =
15% and σ = 58.09%, whereas for Basic Foods ^r = 15% and σ = 23.24%. Thus, if
the two distributions were normal, there would be a 68.26% probability that
Sale.com’s actual return would be in the range of 15% ± 58.09%, or from −43.09%
to 73.09%. For Basic Foods, the 68.26% range is 15% ± 23.24%, or from −8.24% to
38.24%.

The area under the normal curve always equals 1.0, or 100%. Thus, the areas under any pair of normal curves drawn on the same
scale, whether they are peaked or flat, must be equal.
b.
Half of the area under a normal curve is to the left of the mean, indicating that there is a 50% probability that the actual
outcome will be less than the mean, and half is to the right of ^r, indicating a 50% probability that it will be greater
than the mean.

Of the area under the curve, 68.26% is within ±1σ of the mean, indicating that the probability is 68.26% that the actual outcome

Most financial calculators have no built-in formula for finding the expected value or variance for discrete
probability distributions, except for the special case in which the probabilities for all outcomes are equal.
Therefore, you must go through the processes outlined in Figure
6-2 and 6-5 (i.e., Equations 6-1 and
6-3). For an example of this process using a financial calculator, see Richard W. Taylor, “Discrete Proba-
bility Analysis with the BAII Plus Professional Calculator,” Journal of Financial Education, Winter 2005,

Part 3: Stocks and Options

Using Historical Data to Measure Risk
In our previous example, we described the procedure for finding the mean and stan-
dard deviation when the data are in the form of a known probability distribution.
This implies that the distribution includes all data points, not a sample of data points
from a broader universe of returns. Suppose, however, that only a sample of returns
over some past period is available. These past realized rates of return are denoted
as –rt (“r bar t”), where t designates the time period. The average annual return over
the last n years is then denoted as –rAvg:
–rAvg ¼

What Does Risk Really Mean?
As explained in the text, the probability of being within
1 standard deviation of the expected return is 68.26%,
so the probability of being further than 1 standard
deviation from the mean is 31.74%. There is an equal
probability of being above or below the range, so there
is a 15.87% chance of being more than one standard
deviation below the mean, which is roughly equal to a
1 in 6 chance (1 in 6 is 16.67%).
For the average firm listed on the New York Stock Ex-
change, σ has been in the range of 35% to 40% in recent
years, with an expected return of around 8% to 12%. One
standard deviation below this expected return is about
10% −35% = −25%. This means that, for a typical stock in
typical year, there is about a 1 in 6 chance of having a 25%
loss. You might be thinking that 1 in 6 is a pretty low proba-
bility, but what if your chance of getting hit by a car when
you crossed a street were 1 in 6? When put that way, 1 in 6
sounds pretty scary.
You might also correctly be thinking that there would
be a 1 in 6 chance of getting a return higher than 1 stan-
dard deviation above the mean, which would be about
45% for a typical stock. A 45% return is great, but human
nature is such that most investors would dislike a 25% loss
a whole lot more than they would enjoy a 45% gain.
You might also be thinking that you’ll be OK if you hold
stock long enough. But even if you buy and hold a diversi-
fied portfolio for 10 years, there is still roughly a 10%
chance that you will lose money. If you hold it for 20 years,
there is about a 4% chance of losing. Such odds wouldn’t
be worrisome if you were engaged in a game of chance
that could be played multiple times, but you have only
one life to live and just a few rolls of the dice.
We aren’t suggesting that investors shouldn’t buy
stocks; indeed, we own stock ourselves. But we do be-
lieve investors should understand more clearly exactly
how much risk stock investing entails.
5Because we are estimating the standard deviation from a sample of observations, the denominator in
Equation 6-5 is “n −1” and not just “n.” Equations 6-4 and 6-5 are built into all financial calculators.
For example, to find the sample standard deviation, enter the rates of return into the calculator and press
the key marked S (or Sx) to get the standard deviation. See our tutorials on the textbook’s Web site or
your calculator’s manual for details.

When estimated from past data, the standard deviation is often denoted by S.
To illustrate, consider the historical returns in Figure 6-7. Using Equations 6-4 and
6-5, the estimated average and standard deviation are, respectively,

¼ AVERAGEð0:15;−0:05;0:20Þ ¼ 10:0%
¼ STDEVð0:15;−0:05;0:20Þ ¼ 13:2%
The historical standard deviation is often used as an estimate of the future variability.
Because past variability is likely to be repeated, past variability may be a reasonably good
estimate of future risk. However, it is usually incorrect to use rAvg based on a past period
as an estimate of ^r, the expected future return. For example, just because a stock had a
75% return in the past year, there is no reason to expect a 75% return this year.
Measuring Stand-Alone Risk: The Coefficient of Variation
If a choice has to be made between two investments that have the same expected returns
but different standard deviations, most people would choose the one with the lower stan-
dard deviation and, therefore, the lower risk. Similarly, given a choice between two in-
vestments with the same risk (standard deviation) but different expected returns,
investors would generally prefer the investment with the higher expected return. To
most people, this is common sense—return is “good,” risk is “bad,” and consequently in-
vestors want as much return and as little risk as possible. But how do we choose between
two investments if one has a higher expected return and the other a lower standard devi-
ation? To help answer this question, we often use another measure of risk, the coeffi-
cient of variation (CV), which is the standard deviation divided by the expected return:
Coefficient of variation ¼ CV ¼ σ

Part 3: Stocks and Options

The coefficient of variation shows the risk per unit of return, and it provides a more
meaningful basis for comparison than σ when the expected returns on two alternatives
are different. Since Basic Foods and Sale.com have the same expected return,
15%, the coefficient of variation is not necessary in this case: The firm with the
larger standard deviation, Sale.com, must have the larger coefficient of variation
when the means are equal. In fact, the coefficient of variation for Sale.com is
58.09/15 = 3.87 and that for Basic Foods is 23.24/15 = 1.55. Thus, Sale.com is
more than three times as risky as Basic Foods on the basis of this criterion. Be-
cause the coefficient of variation captures the effects of both risk and return, it
is a better measure than the standard deviation when evaluating stand-alone risk
in situations in which different investments have substantially different expected
returns.
Risk Aversion and Required Returns
Suppose you have worked hard and saved $1 million, which you now plan to invest
for 1 year. You can buy a 5% U.S. Treasury security, and at the end of the year you
will have a sure $1.05 million, which is your original investment plus $50,000 in
interest. Alternatively, you can buy stock in Genetic Advances Inc. If Genetic
Advances’s research programs are successful, your stock will increase in value to
$2.1 million. However, if the research is a failure, the value of your stock will go
to zero, and you will be penniless. You regard Genetic Advances’s chances of
The Trade-off between Risk and Return
The table accompanying this box summarizes the histori-
cal trade-off between risk and return for different classes of
investments. The assets that produced the highest average
returns also had the highest standard deviations and the
widest ranges of returns. For example, small-company
stocks had the highest average annual return, but their
standard deviation of returns was also the highest. In con-
trast, U.S. Treasury bills had the lowest standard deviation,
but they also had the lowest average return.
Note that a T-bill is riskless if you hold it until matu-
rity, but if you invest in a rolling portfolio of T-bills and
hold the portfolio for a number of years, then your in-
vestment income will vary depending on what hap-
pens to the level of interest rates in each year. You
can be sure of the return you will earn on an individual
T-bill, but you cannot be sure of the return you will
earn on a portfolio of T-bills held over a number of
years.
aThe excess return over T-bonds is called the “historical risk premium.” This excess return will also be the current risk premium that is reflected in security
prices if and only if investors expect returns in the future to be similar to returns earned in the past.

success or failure as being 50-50, so the expected value of the stock investment is
0.5($0) + 0.5($2,100,000) = $1,050,000. Subtracting the $1 million cost of the stock
leaves an expected profit of $50,000, or an expected (but risky) 5% rate of return:
$50,000/$1,000,000 = 0.05 = 5%.
Thus, you have a choice between a sure $50,000 profit (representing a 5% rate of
return) on the Treasury security and a risky expected $50,000 profit (also represent-
ing a 5% expected rate of return) on the Genetic Advances stock. Which one would
you choose? If you choose the less risky investment, you are risk averse. Most investors are
indeed risk averse, and certainly the average investor is risk averse with regard to his “seri-
ous money.” Because this is a well-documented fact, we shall assume risk aversion through-
out the remainder of the book.
What are the implications of risk aversion for security prices and rates of re-
turn? The answer is that, other things held constant, the higher a security’s risk,
the lower its price and the higher its required return. To see how risk aversion
affects security prices, consider again Basic Foods and Sale.com. Suppose each
stock is expected to pay an annual dividend of $15 forever. We know that the
dividend could be higher or lower, but $15 is our best guess. Under these condi-
tions, the price of each stock can be found as the present value of a perpetuity.
If each stock had an expected return of 15%, then each stock’s price must be P =
$15/0.15 = $100. However, investors are averse to risk, so under these conditions
there would be a general preference for Basic Foods—it has the same expected
return as Sale.com but less risk. People with money to invest would bid for Basic
Foods rather than Sale.com stock, and Sale.com stockholders would start selling
their stock and using the money to buy Basic Foods. Buying pressure would drive
up Basic Foods’s stock price, and selling pressure would simultaneously cause
Sale.com’s price to decline.
These price changes, in turn, would cause changes in the expected rates of return
on the two securities. Suppose, for example, that Basic Foods’s stock price was bid up
from $100 to $150, whereas Sale.com’s stock price declined from $100 to $75. This
would cause Basic Foods’s expected return to fall to 10%, while Sale.com’s expected
return would rise to 20%.6 The difference in returns, 20% −10% = 10%, is a risk
premium, RP, which represents the additional compensation investors require for
assuming the additional risk of Sale.com stock.
This example demonstrates a fundamentally important principle: In a market
dominated by risk-averse investors, riskier securities must have higher expected returns,
as estimated by the marginal investor, than less risky securities. If this situation does not
already exist, then buying and selling in the marketplace will force it to occur. We will
consider the question of how much higher the returns on risky securities must
be later in the chapter, after we see how diversification affects risk and the way
it should be measured. Then, in later chapters, we will see how risk-adjusted
rates of return affect the prices that investors are willing to pay for bonds and
stocks.

6Recall that the present value of a perpetuity is P = PMT/I, where PMT is the constant annual cash flow
of the perpetuity and I is the rate of return. For stocks, we use r for the expected rate of return. Solving
for r, the expected return for Basic Foods is $15/$150 = 0.10 = 10% and that for Sale.com is $15/$75 =
0.20 = 20%.

6.3 RISK IN A PORTFOLIO CONTEXT
In the preceding section we considered the risk of assets held in isolation. Now we
analyze the risk of assets held in portfolios. As we shall see, an asset held as part of
a portfolio is less risky than the same asset held in isolation. Therefore, most financial
assets are actually held as parts of portfolios. Banks, pension funds, insurance compa-
nies, mutual funds, and other financial institutions are required by law to hold diver-
sified portfolios. Even individual investors—at least those whose security holdings
constitute a significant part of their total wealth—generally hold portfolios, not the
stock of only one firm. This being the case, from an investor’s standpoint the fact
that a particular stock goes up or down is not the key issue: What’s important are
the portfolio’s return and its risk. Logically, then, the risk and return of an individual
security should be analyzed in terms of how that security affects the risk and return
of the portfolio in which it is held.
To illustrate, Pay Up Inc. collects debts for other firms and operates nationwide
through 37 offices. The company is not well known, its stock is not very liquid, its
earnings have fluctuated quite a bit in the past, and it doesn’t pay a dividend. All
this suggests that Pay Up is risky and that the required rate of return on its stock
should be relatively high. However, Pay Up’s required rate of return in 2008, and
all other years, was quite low relative to those of most other companies. Thus, inves-
tors regard Pay Up as being a low-risk company in spite of its uncertain profits. This
is counterintuitive, but it is caused by diversification and its effect on risk. Pay Up’s
earnings rise during recessions, whereas most other companies’ earnings tend to de-
cline when the economy slumps. The stock is like a fire insurance policy—it pays off
when other things go badly. Therefore, adding Pay Up to a portfolio of “normal”
stocks tends to stabilize returns on the entire portfolio, thus making the portfolio
less risky.
Portfolio Returns
The expected return on a portfolio, ^rp, is simply the weighted average of the
expected returns on the individual assets in the portfolio. Suppose there are n stocks.
The expected return on Stock i is ^ri. The fraction of the portfolio’s dollar value
invested in Stock i (that is, the value of the investment in Stock i divided by the total
value of the portfolio) is wi, and all the wi must sum to 1.0. The expected return on
the portfolio is

(6-7)
To illustrate, assume that a security analyst estimated the upcoming year’s returns on
the stocks of four large companies, as shown in Figure 6-8. A client wishes to invest
$1 million, divided among the stocks as shown in the figure. Notice that the
$300,000 investment in Southwest Airlines means that its weight in the portfolio is
0.3 = $3,000,000/$1,000,000. The expected portfolio return is:
^rp ¼ w1^r1 þ w2^r2 þ w3^r3 þ w4^r4
¼ 0:3ð15%Þ þ 0:1ð12%Þ þ 0:2ð10%Þ þ 0:4ð9%Þ
¼ 11:3%
Of course, the actual realized rates of return almost certainly will be different from
their expected values, so the realized portfolio return, r–
p, will be different from the
expected return. For example, Starbucks might double and provide a return of
+100%, whereas Dell might have a terrible year, fall sharply, and have a return of
−75%. Note, though, that those two events would be somewhat offsetting, so the
portfolio’s return might still be close to its expected return.
Portfolio Risk
As we just saw, the expected return on a portfolio is simply the weighted average of
the expected returns on the individual assets in the portfolio. However, unlike re-
turns, the risk of a portfolio, σp, is generally not the weighted average of the standard
deviations of the individual assets in the portfolio. Indeed, the portfolio’s standard
deviation will (almost always) be smaller than the assets’ weighted standard devia-
tions, and it is theoretically possible to combine stocks that are individually quite
risky as measured by their standard deviations and form a portfolio that is completely
riskless, with σp = 0.
To illustrate the effect of combining assets, consider first the situation in Figure 6-9.
The bottom section gives data on rates of return for Stocks W and M as well as for a

portfolio invested 50% in each stock. (Note: These stocks are called W and M because the
graphs of their returns in Figure 6-9 resemble a W and an M.) The three graphs plot the
data in a time-series format. Note that the portfolio’s return is 15% in every year. There-
fore, although the two stocks would be quite risky if they were held in isolation, when
combined to form Portfolio WM they are not risky at all.
The reason Stocks W and M can be combined to form a riskless portfolio is that
their returns move countercyclically to each other—when W’s returns fall, those of
M rise, and vice versa. The tendency of two variables to move together is called cor-
relation, and the correlation coefficient measures this tendency.7 The symbol for
the correlation coefficient is the Greek letter rho, ρ (pronounced roe). In statistical
terms, we say that the returns on Stocks W and M are perfectly negatively correlated,
with ρ = −1.0.
The estimate of correlation from a sample of historical data is often called “R.”
Here is the formula to estimate the correlation between stocks i and j (r–
i,t is the actual
return for Stock i in period t, and r–
i,Avg is the average return during the n-period
sample; similar notation is used for stock j):

7The correlation coefficient, ρ, can range from +1.0, denoting that the two variables move up and down
in perfect synchronization, to –1.0, denoting that the variables always move in exactly opposite directions.
A correlation coefficient of zero indicates that the two variables are not related to each other—that is,
changes in one variable are independent of changes in the other.

Fortunately, it is easy to estimate the correlation coefficients with a financial cal-
culator or Excel. With a calculator, simply enter the returns of the two stocks and
then press a key labeled “r.”8 In Excel, use the CORREL function. See Ch06 Tool
Kit.xls, where we calculate the correlation between Stocks W and M.
The opposite of perfect negative correlation, with ρ = −1.0, is perfect positive corre-
lation, with ρ = +1.0. Returns on two perfectly positively correlated stocks move up
and down together, and a portfolio consisting of two such stocks would be exactly
as risky as each individual stock. This point is illustrated in Figure 6-10, where we
see that the portfolio’s standard deviation is equal to that of the individual stocks.

Part 3: Stocks and Options

Thus, diversification does nothing to reduce risk if the portfolio consists of stocks that are per-
fectly positively correlated.
Figures 6-9 and 6-10 show that when stocks are perfectly negatively correlated
(ρ = −1.0), all risk can be diversified away, but when stocks are perfectly positively
correlated (ρ = +1.0), diversification does no good whatsoever. In reality, virtually all
stocks are positively correlated, but not perfectly so. Past studies have estimated that,
on average, the correlation coefficient for the monthly returns on two randomly
selected stocks is in the range of 0.28 to 0.35.9 Under this condition, combining stocks
into portfolios reduces but does not completely eliminate risk. Figure 6-11 illustrates this
point with two stocks whose correlation coefficient is ρ = +0.35. The portfolio’s aver-
age return is 15%, which is exactly the same as the average return for our other two
illustrative portfolios, but its standard deviation is 18.6%, which is between the other
two portfolios’ standard deviations.

9During the period 1968–1998, the average correlation coefficient between two randomly selected stocks
was 0.28, while the average correlation coefficient between two large-company stocks was 0.33; see Louis
K. C. Chan, Jason Karceski, and Josef Lakonishok, “On Portfolio Optimization: Forecasting Covariance
and Choosing the Risk Model,” The Review of Financial Studies, Vol. 12, No. 5, Winter 1999, pp. 937–
974. The average correlation fell from around 0.35 in the late 1970s to less than 0.10 by the late 1990s;

These examples demonstrate that in one extreme case (ρ = −1.0), risk can be
completely eliminated, while in the other extreme case (ρ = +1.0), diversification does
not affect risk at all. The real world lies between these extremes, so combining stocks
into portfolios reduces—but does not eliminate—the risk inherent in the individual
stocks. Also, we should note that in the real world it is impossible to find stocks like W
and M, whose returns are expected to be perfectly negatively correlated. Therefore, it is
impossible to form completely riskless stock portfolios. Diversification can reduce risk but not
eliminate it, so the real world is similar to the situation depicted in Figure 6-11.
What would happen if we included more than two stocks in the portfolio? As a
rule, the risk of a portfolio declines as the number of stocks in the portfolio increases. If we
added enough partially correlated stocks, could we completely eliminate risk? The
answer is “no,” but adding stocks to a portfolio reduces its risk to an extent that
depends on the degree of correlation among the stocks: The smaller the stocks’ corre-
lation coefficients, the lower the portfolio’s risk. If we could find stocks with correla-
tions of −1.0, all risk could be eliminated. However, in the real world the correlations
among the individual stocks are generally positive but less than +1.0, so some (but not all)
risk can be eliminated.
In general, there are higher correlations between the returns on two companies in
the same industry than for two companies in different industries. There are also
higher correlations among similar “style” companies, such as large versus small and
growth versus value. Thus, to minimize risk, portfolios should be diversified across
industries and styles.
Diversifiable Risk versus Market Risk
As already mentioned, it’s difficult if not impossible to find stocks whose expected returns
are negatively correlated—most stocks tend to do well when the national economy is strong
and badly when it is weak. Thus, even very large portfolios end up with a substantial
amount of risk, but not as much risk as if all the money were invested in only one stock.
How Risky Is a Large Portfolio of Stocks?
Many investors, including the authors of this text, buy
“index” mutual funds that hold the S&P 500. Such
funds are obviously well diversified. However, as you
can see from the accompanying graph, diversification
didn’t help much when the market crashed in 2008. In
just 2½ months, the market lost over 40% of its value.
Someone with a $1 million nest egg invested in this
“safe” portfolio suddenly experienced a $411,000 loss.
Diversification helps, but it doesn’t eliminate stock mar-
ket risk.

To see more precisely how portfolio size affects portfolio risk, consider Figure 6-12,
which shows how portfolio risk is affected by forming larger and larger portfolios
of randomly selected New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) stocks. Standard devia-
tions are plotted for an average one-stock portfolio, an average two-stock portfo-
lio, and so on, up to a portfolio consisting of all 2,000-plus common stocks that
were listed on the NYSE at the time the data were plotted. The graph illustrates
that, in general, the risk of a portfolio consisting of large-company stocks tends
to decline and to approach some limit as the size of the portfolio increases.
According to data accumulated in recent years, σ1, the standard deviation of a
one-stock portfolio (or an average stock), is approximately 35%. However, a port-
folio consisting of all stocks, which is called the market portfolio, would have a
standard deviation, σM, of only about 20%, which is shown as the horizontal
dashed line in Figure 6-12.
Thus, almost half of the risk inherent in an average individual stock can be eliminated if
the stock is held in a reasonably well-diversified portfolio, which is one containing forty or
more stocks in a number of different industries. Some risk always remains—terrorists
can attack, recessions can get out of hand, meteors can strike, and so forth—so it is
impossible to diversify away the effects of broad stock market movements that affect
virtually all stocks.

The part of a stock’s risk that can be eliminated is called diversifiable risk, while the
part that cannot be eliminated is called market risk.10 The fact that a large part of the
risk of any individual stock can be eliminated is vitally important, because rational
investors will eliminate it and thus render it irrelevant.
Diversifiable risk is caused by such random events as lawsuits, strikes, successful
and unsuccessful marketing programs, winning or losing a major contract, and other
events that are unique to a particular firm. Because these events are random, their
effects on a portfolio can be eliminated by diversification—bad events in one firm
will be offset by good events in another. Market risk, on the other hand, stems
from factors that systematically affect most firms: war, inflation, recessions, and high
interest rates. Because most stocks are negatively affected by these factors, market
risk cannot be eliminated by diversification.
We know that investors demand a premium for bearing risk; that is, the higher the
risk of a security, the higher its expected return must be to induce investors to buy
(or to hold) it. However, if investors are primarily concerned with the risk of their
portfolios rather than the risk of the individual securities in the portfolio, then how
should the risk of an individual stock be measured? One answer is provided by the
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), an important tool used to analyze the rela-
tionship between risk and rates of return.11 The primary conclusion of the CAPM is
this: The relevant risk of an individual stock is its contribution to the risk of a well-
diversified portfolio. A stock might be quite risky if held by itself, but—since about
half of its risk can be eliminated by diversification—the stock’s relevant risk is its
contribution to the portfolio’s risk, which is much smaller than its stand-alone risk.
A simple example will help make this point clear. Suppose you are offered the
chance to flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you win $20,000, but if it’s tails, you lose
$16,000. This is a good bet—the expected return is 0.5($20,000) + 0.5(−$16,000) = $2,000.
However, it’s a highly risky proposition because you have a 50% chance of losing
$16,000. Thus, you might well refuse to make the bet. Alternatively, suppose that
you were to flip 100 coins and that you would win $200 for each head but lose
$160 for each tail. It is theoretically possible that you would flip all heads and
win $20,000, and it is also theoretically possible that you would flip all tails and
lose $16,000, but the chances are very high that you would actually flip about 50
heads and about 50 tails, winning a net of about $2,000. Although each individual
flip is a risky bet, collectively you have a low-risk proposition because most of the
risk has been diversified away. This is the idea behind holding portfolios of stocks
rather than just one stock. The difference is that, with stocks, not all of the risk
can be eliminated by diversification—those risks related to broad, systematic
changes in the stock market will remain.
Are all stocks equally risky in the sense that adding them to a well-diversified portfo-
lio will have the same effect on the portfolio’s risk? The answer is “no.” Different stocks
will affect the portfolio differently, so different securities have different degrees of rele-
vant risk. How can the relevant risk of an individual stock be measured? As we have seen,
all risk except that related to broad market movements can, and presumably will, be
diversified away. After all, why accept risk that can be eliminated easily? The risk that
remains after diversifying is called market risk, the risk that is inherent in the market. In the
10Diversifiable risk is also known as company-specific, or unsystematic, risk. Market risk is also known as
nondiversifiable, systematic, or beta, risk; it is the risk that remains after diversification.
11Indeed, Nobel Prizes were awarded to the developers of the CAPM, Professors Harry Markowitz and
William F. Sharpe. The CAPM is a relatively complex theory, and only its basic elements are presented
in this chapter.

next section, we develop a measure of a stock’s market risk and then, in a later section,
we introduce an equation for determining the required rate of return on a stock, given
its market risk.
Contribution to Market Risk: Beta
The primary conclusion reached in the preceding section is that the relevant risk of
an individual stock is the amount of risk the stock contributes to a well-diversified
portfolio. The benchmark for a well-diversified stock portfolio is the market portfo-
lio, which is a portfolio containing all stocks. Therefore, the relevant risk of an indi-
vidual stock, which is measured by its beta coefficient, is defined under the CAPM
as the amount of risk that the stock contributes to the market portfolio. In CAPM
terminology, ρiM is the correlation between Stock i’s return and the market return,
σi is the standard deviation of Stock i’s return, and σM is the standard deviation of
the market’s return. The beta coefficient of Stock i, denoted by bi, is found as
follows:

The Benefits of Diversifying Overseas
Figure 6-12 shows that an investor can significantly re-
duce portfolio risk by holding a large number of stocks.
The figure accompanying this box suggests that investors
may be able to reduce risk even further by holding stocks
from all around the world, because the returns on domes-
tic and international stocks are not perfectly correlated.
Although U.S. investors have traditionally been
relatively reluctant to hold international assets, it is a
safe bet that in the years ahead U.S. investors will
shift more and more of their assets to overseas
investments.

This tells us that a stock with a high standard deviation, σi, will tend to have a
high beta, which means that, other things held constant, the stock contributes a lot
of risk to a well-diversified portfolio. This makes sense, because a stock with high
stand-alone risk will tend to destabilize the portfolio. Note too that a stock with a
high correlation with the market, ρiM, will also tend to have a large beta and hence
be risky. This also makes sense, because a high correlation means that diversification
is not helping much, with most of the stock’s risk affecting the portfolio’s risk.
It is also useful to transform the variables in Equation 6-9 to form the covariance
between Stock i and the market, COViM, defined as12
COViM = ρiMσiσM
(6-10)
Substituting Equation 6-10 into 6-9 provides another frequently used expression for
calculating beta:
bi ¼ COViM
σ2
M
(6-11)
Calculators and spreadsheets can calculate the components of Equation 6-9 (ρiM, σi,
and σM), which can then be used to calculate beta, but there is another way. Suppose
you plotted the stock’s returns on the y-axis of a graph and the market portfolio’s
returns on the x-axis. The formula for the slope of a regression line is exactly equal to
the formula for beta in Equation 6-11. Therefore, to estimate beta for a security, you
can just estimate a regression with the stock’s returns on the y-axis and the market’s
returns on the x-axis, which we do in the next section.
Individual Stocks’ Betas
The tendency of a stock to move up and down with the market is reflected in its beta
coefficient. An average-risk stock is defined as one with a beta equal to 1 (b = 1.0). Such
a stock’s returns tend to move up and down, on average, with the market, which is
measured by some index such as the S&P 500 Index. A portfolio of such b = 1.0 stocks
will move up and down with the broad market indexes, and it will be just as risky as the
market. A portfolio of b = 0.5 stocks tends to move in the same direction as the market,
but to a lesser degree. On the other hand, a portfolio of b = 2.0 stocks also tends to
move with the market, but it will have even bigger swings than the market.
Figure 6-13 shows a graph of the historical returns of three stocks versus the mar-
ket. The data below the graph show that in Year 1 the “market,” defined as a portfo-
lio consisting of all stocks, had a total return (dividend yield plus capital gains yield)
of r–M = 19% and that Stocks H, A, and L (for High, Average, and Low risk) had
returns of 26%, 19%, and 12%, respectively. In Year 2, the market went up sharply,

Calculating the covariance is somewhat easier than calculating the correlation. So if you have already
calculated the standard deviations, it is easier to calculate the covariance and then calculate the
correlation as ρiM ¼ COViM=(σiσM).
240
Part 3: Stocks and Options

and the return on the market portfolio was r–M = 25%. Returns on the three stocks
also went up: H soared to 35%; A went up to 25%, the same as the market; and L
went up only to 15%. The market dropped in Year 3, when the market return was
r–M = −15%. The three stocks’ returns also fell: H plunging to −25%, A falling to −15%,
and L going down to r–L = −5%. Thus, the three stocks all moved in the same direction as
the market, but H was by far the most volatile; A was just as volatile as the market; and L
was less volatile than the market.
Beta measures a stock’s tendency to move up and down with the market. By defi-
nition, then, the market has b = 1.0. As noted previously, the slope of a regression
line shows how a stock moves in response to a movement in the general market.
Most stocks have betas in the range of 0.50 to 1.50, and the average beta for all
stocks is 1.0 by definition.
Theoretically, it is possible for a stock to have a negative beta. In this case, the stock’s
returns would tend to rise whenever the returns on other stocks fall. In practice, few if

any stocks have a negative beta. Keep in mind that a stock in a given period may move
counter to the overall market even though the stock’s “true” beta is positive. If a stock
has a positive beta, we would expect its return to increase whenever the overall stock mar-
ket rises. However, company-specific factors may cause the stock’s realized return in a
given period to decline, even though the market’s return is positive.
Portfolio Betas
An important aspect of the CAPM is that the beta of a portfolio is a weighted average
of its individual securities’ betas:
bp ¼ w1b1 þ w2b2 þ … þ wnbn
¼
X
n
i¼1
wibi
(6-12)
Here bp is the beta of the portfolio, which shows its tendency to move with the mar-
ket; wi is the fraction of the portfolio invested in Stock i; and bi is the beta coefficient
of Stock i. For example, if an investor holds a $100,000 portfolio consisting of
$33,333.333 invested in each of three stocks, and if each of the stocks has a beta of
0.70, then the portfolio’s beta will be bp = 0.70:
bp = 0.3333(0.70) + 0.3333(0.70) + 0.3333(0.70) = 0.70
Such a portfolio will be less risky than the market, so it should experience relatively
narrow price swings and have relatively small fluctuations in its rates of return. In
terms of Figure 6-13, the slope of its regression line would be 0.70, which is less
than that for a portfolio of average stocks.
Now suppose that one of the existing stocks is sold and replaced by a stock
with bi = 2.00. This action will increase the beta of the portfolio from bp1 = 0.70 to
bp2 = 1.13:
bp2 ¼ 0:3333ð0:70Þ þ 0:3333ð0:70Þ þ 0:3333ð2:00Þ
¼ 1:13
Had a stock with bi = 0.20 been added, the portfolio beta would have declined from
0.70 to 0.53. Adding a low-beta stock, therefore, would reduce the risk of the portfo-
lio. Consequently, adding new stocks to a portfolio can change the risk of that port-
folio. Since a stock’s beta measures its contribution to the risk of a portfolio, beta is the
theoretically correct measure of the stock’s risk.
Some Other Points Related to Beta
The preceding analysis of risk in a portfolio context is part of the CAPM, and we
highlight the key points below.
1. A stock’s risk consists of two components, market risk and diversifiable risk.
2. Diversifiable risk can be eliminated by diversification, and most investors do in-
deed diversify, either by holding large portfolios or by purchasing shares in a
mutual fund. We are left, then, with market risk, which is caused by general
movements in the stock market and which reflects the fact that most stocks are
systematically affected by events like war, recessions, and inflation. Market risk is
the only risk relevant to a rational, diversified investor because such an investor
can eliminate diversifiable risk.
242
Part 3: Stocks and Options

3. Investors must be compensated for bearing risk: The greater the risk of a stock,
the higher its required return. However, compensation is required only for risk
that cannot be eliminated by diversification. If stocks had risk premiums due to
diversifiable risk, then well-diversified investors would start buying those securi-
ties (which the investors would not consider especially risky) and bidding up their
prices. The stocks’ final (equilibrium) expected returns would reflect only nondi-
versifiable market risk.
4. The market risk of a stock is measured by its beta coefficient, and beta is the
proper measure of the stock’s relevant risk. If b equals 1.0, then the stock is about
as risky as the market, assuming it is held in a diversified portfolio. If b is less
than 1.0 then the stock is less risky than the market; if beta is greater than 1.0,
the stock is more risky.
5. The beta of a portfolio is a weighted average of the individual securities’ betas.
6. Since a stock’s beta coefficient determines how the stock affects the risk of a diversified
portfolio, beta is the most relevant measure of any stock’s risk.

invested in Ford, and $25,000 invested in Wal-Mart. Dell’s beta is estimated to be
1.20, Ford’s beta is estimated to be 0.80, and Wal-Mart’s beta is estimated to be 1.0.
What is the estimated beta of the investor’s portfolio? (0.95)
6.4 CALCULATING BETA COEFFICIENTS
The CAPM is an ex ante model, which means that all of the variables represent
before-the-fact, expected values. In particular, the beta coefficient used by investors
should reflect the relationship between a stock’s expected return and the market’s re-
turn during some future period. However, people generally calculate betas using data
from some past period and then assume that the stock’s risk will be the same in the
future as it was in the past.
Table 6–1 shows the betas for some well-known companies as provided by two
different financial organizations, Zacks and Yahoo! Finance. Notice that their esti-
mates of beta usually differ because they calculate it in slightly different ways. Given
these differences, many analysts choose to calculate their own betas or else average
the published betas.
Recall from Figure 6-13 how betas can be calculated. The actual historical returns for
a company are plotted on the y-axis and the market portfolio’s returns are plotted on the
x-axis. A regression line is then fitted through the points, and the slope of that line pro-
vides an estimate of the stock’s beta. It is possible to compute beta coefficients with a
calculator, but in the real world a computer is typically used, either with a statistical
Chapter 6: Risk, Return, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model
243

software program or a spreadsheet program. The chapter’s Excel Tool Kit model shows
how GE’s beta can be calculated using Excel’s regression function.13
The first step in a regression analysis is getting the data. Most analysts use 4 to 5
years of monthly data, although some use 52 weeks of weekly data. We decided to
use 4 years (48 months) of monthly data, so we began by downloading 49 months
of stock prices for GE from the Yahoo! Finance Web site (we needed 49 months of
data to get 48 rates of return). We used the S&P 500 Index as the market portfolio
because it is representative of the market and because many analysts use this index.
Figure 6-14 shows a portion of these data; the full data set is in the chapter’s Tool Kit.
The second step is to convert the stock prices into rates of return. For example, to
find the March 2009 return for GE, we find the percentage change from the previous
month: ($10.11 −$8.51)/$8.51 = 0.188 = 18.8%.14 We also find the percent change
of the S&P Index level and use this as the market return.
As the lower portion of Figure 6-14 shows, GE had an average annual return of
−22.9% during this 4-year period, while the market had an average annual return of
−8.5%. As we noted before, it is usually unreasonable to think that the future
expected return for a stock will equal its average historical return over a relatively
short period, such as 4 years. If this were not true, then why would anyone buy either
the S&P or GE if they expected the same negative returns as were earned in the
past? However, we might well expect past volatility to be a reasonable estimate of fu-

14The prices reported in Yahoo! Finance are adjusted for dividends and stock splits, so we can calculate
the return as the percentage change in the adjusted price. If you use a source that reports actual market
prices, then you must make the adjustment yourself when calculating returns. For example, suppose the
stock price is $100 in January, the company has a 2-for-1 split, and the actual price is then $60 in Febru-
ary. The reported adjusted price for February would be $60, but the reported adjusted price for January
would be lowered to $50 to reflect the stock split. This gives an accurate stock return of 20%: ($60 −
$50)/$50 = 20%, the same as if there had not been a split, in which case the return would have been
($120 −$100)/$100 = 20%. Or suppose the actual price in March was $50, the company paid a $10 divi-
dend, and the actual price in April was $60. Shareholders have earned a return of ($60 + $10 −$50)/$50 =
40%. Yahoo! Finance reports an adjusted price of $60 for April and an adjusted price of $42.857 for
March, which gives a return of ($60 – $42.857)/$42.857 = 40%. Again, the percentage change in the ad-
justed price accurately reflects the actual return.

ture volatility, at least during the next couple of years. Note that the annualized stan-
dard deviation for GE’s return during this period was 28.9% versus 15.9% for the
market. The range between GE’s minimum and maximum returns is also greater
than the corresponding range for the market. Thus, GE’s volatility is greater than
the market’s volatility. This is what we would expect, since the market is a well-
diversified portfolio and so much of its risk has been diversified away. The correla-
tion between GE’s stock returns and the market returns is 0.76, which is somewhat
higher than the correlation between a typical stock and the market.

against the market returns. As you will notice if you look in the Excel Tool Kit file,
we used the Excel chart feature to add a trend line and to display the equation and R2
value on the chart itself. We also could have used the Excel regression analysis fea-
ture, which would have provided more detailed data.
Figure 6-15 indicates that GE’s estimated beta is about 1.37, as shown by the slope
coefficient in the regression equation displayed on the chart. This means that GE’s beta
is greater than the 1.0 average beta. Therefore, GE’s returns tend to move up and down
(on average) by more than the market’s returns. Note, however, that the points are only
loosely clustered around the regression line. Sometimes GE does much better than the

market, while at other times it does much worse. The R2 value shown in the chart mea-
sures the degree of dispersion about the regression line. Statistically speaking, it measures
the percentage of the variance that is explained by the regression equation. An R2 of 1.0
indicates that all points lie exactly on the line and hence that all of the variations in the
y-variable are explained by the x-variable. GE’s R2 is about 0.57, which is somewhat
higher than the typical stock R2 of 0.32. This indicates that about 57% of the variance
in GE’s returns is explained by the market returns versus only 32% of the explained var-
iance of a typical stock. If we had done a similar analysis for a portfolio of forty randomly
selected stocks, then the points would probably have been clustered tightly around the
regression line and the R2 probably would have exceeded 0.90.
Finally, observe that the intercept shown in the regression equation on the chart is
−0.0094. This indicates that GE’s average monthly return was −0.94% less than that
of a typical company during these 4 years, or 12(−0.94%) = −11.28% less per year as
a result of factors other than the general decline in stock prices.

6.5 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RISK AND RETURN
In the preceding section we saw that, under the CAPM theory, beta is the proper measure
of a stock’s relevant risk. However, we need to quantify how risk affects required

returns: For a given level of risk as measured by beta, what rate of return do investors re-
quire to compensate them for bearing that risk? To begin, let us define the following terms.
r^
i = Expected rate of return on Stock i.
ri= Required rate of return on Stock i. This is the minimum expected return
that is required to induce an average investor to purchase the stock.
r– = Realized, after-the-fact return.
rRF = Risk-free rate of return. In this context, rRF is generally measured by the
expected return on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds.
bi = Beta coefficient of Stock i.
rM = Required rate of return on a portfolio consisting of all stocks, which is
called the market portfolio.
RPM = Risk premium on “the market.” RPM = (rM −rRF) is the additional
return over the risk-free rate required to induce an average investor to
invest in the market portfolio.
RPi = Risk premium on Stock i: RPi = (RPM)bi.
The market risk premium, RPM, is the premium that investors require for bearing the
risk of an average stock, and it depends on the degree of risk aversion that investors on aver-
age have. Assume that Treasury bonds yield rRF = 6% and that the stock market has a re-
quired return of rM = 11%. Under these conditions, the market risk premium, RPM, is 5%:
RPM = rM −rRF = 11% −6% = 5%
We can measure a stock’s relative risk by its beta coefficient and then calculate its
individual risk premium as follows:
Risk premium for Stock i = RPi = (RPM)bi
(6-13)
For example, if bi = 0.5 and RPM = 5%, then RPi is 2.5%:
RPi ¼ ð5%Þð0:5Þ
¼ 2:5%
The required return for any investment can be expressed in general terms as
Required return = Risk-free return + Premium for risk
Here the risk-free return includes a premium for expected inflation, and we assume
that the assets under consideration have similar maturities and liquidity. Under these
conditions, the relationship between risk and required returns can be found as speci-
fied in the Security Market Line (SML):

The required return for our illustrative Stock i is then found as follows:
ri ¼ 6% þ 5%ð0:5Þ
¼ 8:5%
If some other Stock j were riskier than Stock i and had bj = 2.0, then its required rate
of return would be 16%:
rj = 6% + (5%)2.0 = 16%
An average stock, with b = 1.0, would have a required return of 11%, the same as the
market return:
rA = 6% + (5%)1.0 = 11% = rM
Equation 6-14 is called the Security Market Line (SML) equation, and it is often
expressed in graph form; see Figure 6-16, which shows the SML when rRF = 6% and
RPM = 5%. Note the following points.
1. Required rates of return are shown on the vertical axis, while risk as measured by
beta is shown on the horizontal axis. This graph is quite different from the one
shown in Figure 6-13, where the returns on individual stocks were plotted on
the vertical axis and returns on the market index were shown on the horizontal
axis. The slopes of the three lines in Figure 6-13 were used to calculate the three
stocks’ betas, and those betas were then plotted as points on the horizontal axis
of Figure 6-16.

2. Riskless securities have bi = 0; therefore, rRF appears as the vertical axis intercept
in Figure 6-16. If we could construct a portfolio that had a beta of zero, then it
would have a required return equal to the risk-free rate.
3. The slope of the SML (5% in Figure 6-16) reflects the degree of risk aversion in
the economy: The greater the average investor’s aversion to risk, then (a) the
steeper the slope of the line, (b) the greater the risk premium for all stocks, and
(c) the higher the required rate of return on all stocks.15 These points are dis-
cussed further in a later section.
4. The values we worked out for stocks with bi = 0.5, bi = 1.0, and bi = 2.0 agree
with the values shown on the graph for rL, rA, and rH.
5. Negative betas are rare, but they can occur. For example, some stocks associated
with gold, such as a mining operation, occasionally have a negative beta. Based on
the SML, a stock with a negative beta should have a required return less than the
risk-free rate. In fact, a stock with a very large but negative beta might have
negative required return! This means that when the market is doing well, this
stock will do poorly. But it also implies the opposite: When the market is doing
poorly, a negative-beta stock should have a positive return. In other words, the
negative-beta stock acts like an insurance policy. Therefore, an investor might be
willing to accept a negative return on the stock during good times if it is likely to
provide a positive return in bad times.
What would happen if a stock’s expected return, r^i, were greater than its required
return, ri? In other words, suppose investors thought they could get a 14% return
even though the stock’s risk only justified an 11% return? If all investors felt this
way, then demand for the stock would soar as investors tried to purchase it. But if
everyone tried to buy the stock, its price would go up. As the price went up, the extra
expected returns would evaporate until the expected return equaled the required re-
turn. The reverse would happen if the expected return were less than the required
return. Therefore, it seems reasonable to expect that investors’ actions would tend
to drive the expected return toward the required return.
Unexpected news about a stock’s cash flow prospects would certainly change the
stock’s expected return. A stock’s required return can also change because the Secu-
rity Market Line and a company’s position on it can change over time as a result of
changes in interest rates, investors’ aversion to risk, and individual companies’ betas.
Such changes are discussed in the following sections.
The Impact of Changes in Inflation and Interest Rates
Interest is the same as “rent” on borrowed money, or the price of money. Thus, rRF
is the price of money to a riskless borrower. The risk-free rate as measured by the
rate on U.S. Treasury securities is called the nominal, or quoted, rate, and it consists
of two elements: (1) a real inflation-free rate of return, r*; and (2) an inflation premium,
IP, equal to the anticipated rate of inflation.16 Thus, rRF = r* + IP. The real rate on
15Students sometimes confuse beta with the slope of the SML. This is a mistake. The slope of any
straight line is equal to the “rise” divided by the “run,” or (Y1 −Y0)/(X1 −X0). Consider Figure 6-16.
If we let Y = r and X = beta and if we go from the origin to b = 1.0, then we see that the slope is
(rM −rRF)/(bM −bRF) = (11% −6%)/(1 −0) = 5%. Thus, the slope of the SML is equal to (rM −rRF), the
market risk premium. In Figure 6-16, ri = 6% + 5%(bi), so an increase of beta from 1.0 to 2.0 would produce
a 5-percentage-point increase in ri.
16In addition to anticipated inflation, the inflation premium may also include a premium for bearing in-
flation risk. Long-term Treasury bonds also contain a maturity risk premium, MRP. Here we include the
MRP in r* to simplify the discussion. See Chapter 5 for more on bond pricing and bond risk premiums.
Chapter 6: Risk, Return, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model
249

long-term Treasury bonds has historically ranged from 2% to 4% with a mean of
about 3%. Therefore, the 6% rRF shown in Figure 6-16 might be thought of as consist-
ing of a 3% real risk-free rate of return plus a 3% inflation premium: rRF = r* + IP =
3% + 3% = 6%.
The nominal risk-free rate could change as a result of changes in anticipated infla-
tion or changes in the real interest rate. Consider a recession, such as the one that
began in 2007. If consumers and businesses decide to cut back on spending, this will
reduce the demand for funds, and that will, other things held constant, lower the
risk-free rate and thus the required return on other investments.17 A key point to
note is that a change in rRF will not necessarily cause a change in the market risk
premium. Thus, as rRF changes, so will the required return on the market, and this
will, other things held constant, keep the market risk premium stable.
Suppose the risk-free interest rate increases to 8% from some combination of an in-
crease in real rates and in anticipated inflation. Such a change is shown in Figure 6-17.
Notice that, under the CAPM, the increase in rRF leads to an identical increase in the rate
of return on all assets, because the same risk-free rate is built into the required rate of
return on all assets. For example, the rate of return on an average stock, rM, increases
from 11% to 13%. Other risky securities’ returns also rise by 2 percentage points.

17Think of a sailboat floating in a harbor. The distance from the ocean floor to the ocean surface is like
the risk-free rate, and it moves up and down with the tides. The distance from the top of the ship’s mast
to the ocean floor is like the required market return: It too moves up and down with the tides. The dis-
tance from the mast-top to the ocean surface is like the market risk premium—it also stays the same,
even though tides move the ship up and down. Thus, other things held constant, a change in the risk-
free rate also causes an identical change in the required market return, rM, resulting in a relatively stable
market risk premium, rM −rRF.
250
Part 3: Stocks and Options

Changes in Risk Aversion
The slope of the Security Market Line reflects the extent to which investors are
averse to risk: The steeper the slope of the line, the greater the average investor’s
aversion to risk. Suppose all investors were indifferent to risk—that is, suppose they
were not risk averse. If rRF were 6%, then risky assets would also provide an expected
return of 6%, because if there were no risk aversion then there would be no risk pre-
mium, and the SML would be plotted as a horizontal line. As risk aversion increases,
so does the risk premium, and this causes the slope of the SML to become steeper.
Figure 6-18 illustrates an increase in risk aversion. The market risk premium rises
from 5% to 7.5%, causing rM to rise from rM1 = 11% to rM2 = 13.5%. The returns on
other risky assets also rise, and the effect of this shift in risk aversion is greater for riskier
securities. For example, the required return on a stock with bi = 0.5 increases by only 1.25
percentage points, from 8.5% to 9.75%; that on a stock with bi = 1.0 increases by 2.5
percentage points, from 11.0% to 13.5%; and that on a stock with bi = 1.5 increases by
3.75 percentage points, from 13.5% to 17.25%.
Changes in a Stock’s Beta Coefficient
Given risk aversion and a positively sloped SML as in Figure 6-18, the higher a stock’s beta,
the higher its required rate of return. As we shall see later in the book, a firm can influence
its beta through changes in the composition of its assets and also through its use of debt:
Acquiring riskier assets will increase beta, as will a change in capital structure that calls for
a higher debt ratio. A company’s beta can also change as a result of external factors such as
increased competition in its industry, the expiration of basic patents, and the like. When
such changes lead to a higher or lower beta, the required rate of return will also change.

Another Kind of Risk: The Bernie Madoff Story
In the fall of 2008, Bernard Madoff’s massive Ponzi scheme
was exposed, revealing an important type of risk that’s not
dealt with in this chapter. Madoff was a money manager in
the 1960s, and apparently through good luck he produced
above-average results for several years. His clients then told
their friends about Madoff’s success, and those friends sent
in money for him to invest. Madoff’s actual returns then
dropped, but he didn’t tell his clients that they were losing
money. Rather, he told them that returns were holding up
well, and he used new incoming money to pay dividends
and meet withdrawal requests. The idea of using new
money to pay off old investors is called a Ponzi scheme,
named after Charles Ponzi, a Bostonian who set up the first
widely publicized such scheme in the early 1900s.
Madoff perfected the system, ran his scheme for about
40 years, and attracted about $50 billion of investors’
funds. His investors ranged from well-known billionaires
to retirees who invested their entire life savings. His ad-
vertising was strictly word-of-mouth, and clients telling
potential clients about the many wealthy and highly re-
garded people who invested with him certainly helped.
All of his investors assumed that someone else had
done the “due diligence” and found the operation to be
clean. A few investors who actually did some due dili-
gence were suspicious and didn’t invest with him, but
for the most part people just blindly followed the others.
The hedge fund boom that began in the 1990s was a
big help. “Funds of funds,” which are hedge funds set up
to investigate and then invest in other hedge funds,
gained momentum, and some of those funds were Mad-
off’s biggest investors. They were a scam in their own
right, taking fees to investigate other hedge funds and
money managers to find the best of them, but really do-
ing virtually no investigating on their own and simply
sending the money entrusted to them to Bernie Madoff.
Madoff also paid some “finders” to frequent country club
bars, brag about how well they were doing in the market,
and induce other fish to swim into Madoff’s net.
All Ponzi schemes crash when something occurs that
causes some investors to seek to withdraw funds in
amounts greater than the incoming funds from new inves-
tors. Someone tries to get out, can’t do it, tells others who
worry and try to get out too, and almost overnight the
scam unravels. That happened to Madoff in 2008, when
the stock market crash caused some of his investors to
seek withdrawals and few new dollars were coming in. In
the end, his investors lost billions; some lost their entire life
savings, and several have committed suicide. Moreover,
the Madoff revelations have led to the exposure of other,
similar (but smaller), frauds. Indeed, people—especially
the rich and famous—are reluctant to admit they’ve been
taken, so it’s likely that lots of frauds are never reported.
How can you guard against a fraud like Madoff’s? For a
scheme as sophisticated as that of Madoff, it’s not easy,
but there are some steps that can and should be taken.
1. Use your basic financial knowledge and some com-
mon sense. Earlier in this chapter we gave you an
idea about the kinds of returns that have been
earned in the past on different classes of in-
vestments with different risk profiles. If some-
one offers you an investment that seems too
good to be true, it probably is, so you should
drill deep to see if it is really what its sponsor
says it is before you invest. If you don’t have the
time and expertise for such investigation, you
should probably avoid the investment.
2. Deal with reputable institutions. We hate to recom-
mend avoiding small and new organizations, but
unless you have the ability to check out an invest-
ment manager carefully, that’s probably a good
idea. There are institutions with the expertise to
conductsuchinvestigations,soyoumightbewiseto
leavethetoo-good-to-be-trueinvestmentstothem.
3. Diversify. Many people were burned by Bernie
Madoff, but the ones who were hurt worst
were those who trusted most or all of their
funds to him. Those who diversified their
holdings were hurt, but they weren’t wiped
out. So diversify!

6.6 SOME CONCERNS ABOUT BETA AND THE CAPM
The Capital Asset Pricing Model is more than just an abstract theory described in
textbooks. It has great intuitive appeal, and it is widely used by analysts, investors,
and corporations. However, a number of recent studies have raised concerns about
its validity. For example, a study by Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago and
Kenneth French of Dartmouth found no historical relationship between stocks’
returns and their market betas, confirming a position long held by some professors
and stock market analysts.18
As an alternative to the traditional CAPM, researchers and practitioners are devel-
oping models with more explanatory variables than just beta. These multi-factor
models represent an attractive generalization of the traditional CAPM model’s in-
sight that market risk—risk that cannot be diversified away—underlies the pricing
of assets. In the multi-variable models, risk is assumed to be caused by a number of
different factors, including size of firm, market/book ratios, measures of liquidity, and
the like, whereas the CAPM gauges risk only relative to returns on the market port-
folio. The multi-variable models represent a potentially important step forward in fi-
nance theory, but they also have some deficiencies when applied in practice. As a
result, the basic CAPM is still the most widely used method for thinking about re-
quired rates of return on stocks.

6.7 SOME CONCLUDING THOUGHTS: IMPLICATIONS FOR
CORPORATE MANAGERS AND INVESTORS
The connection between risk and return is an important concept, and it has numer-
ous implications for both corporate managers and investors. As we will see in later
chapters, corporate managers spend a great deal of time assessing the risk and returns
of individual projects. Indeed, given their concerns about the risk of individual pro-
jects, it might be fair to ask why we spend so much time discussing the riskiness of
stocks. Why not begin by looking at the riskiness of such business assets as plant and
equipment? The reason is that, for a management whose primary goal is to maximize

They found that stock returns are related to firm size and market/book ratios. Small firms and those firms
with low market/book ratios had higher returns; however, they found no relationship between returns and

intrinsic value, the overriding consideration is the riskiness of the firm’s stock, and the rele-
vant risk of any physical asset must be measured in terms of its effect on the stock’s risk as
seen by investors. For example, suppose Goodyear is considering a major investment
in a new product, recapped tires. Sales of recaps and hence earnings on the new op-
eration are highly uncertain, so on a stand-alone basis the new venture appears to be
quite risky. However, suppose returns in the recap business are negatively correlated
with Goodyear’s other operations: When times are good and people have plenty of
money, they buy new cars with new tires, but when times are bad, they tend to
keep their old cars and buy recaps for them. Therefore, returns would be high on
regular operations and low on the recap division during good times, but the opposite
would be true during recessions. The result might be a pattern like that shown earlier
in Figure 6-9 for Stocks W and M. Thus, what appears to be a risky investment
when viewed on a stand-alone basis might not be so risky when viewed within the
context of the company as a whole.
This analysis can be extended to the corporation’s stockholders. Because Good-
year’s stock is owned by diversified stockholders, the real issue each time manage-
ment makes an investment decision is this: How will this investment affect the risk
of our stockholders? Again, the stand-alone risk of an individual project may look
quite high; however, when viewed in the context of the project’s effect on stock-
holder risk, it may not be as large. We will address this issue again in Chapter 11,
where we examine the effects of capital budgeting on companies’ beta coefficients
and thus on stockholders’ risks.
These concepts are obviously important for individual investors, but they are also
important for corporate managers. Here we summarize some key ideas that all inves-
tors should consider.
1. There is a trade-off between risk and return. The average investor likes higher re-
turns but dislikes risk. It follows that higher-risk investments need to offer in-
vestors higher expected returns. Put another way: If you are seeking higher
returns, you must be willing to assume higher risks.
2. Diversification is crucial. By diversifying wisely, investors can dramatically reduce
risk without reducing their expected returns. Don’t put all of your money in one
or two stocks, or in one or two industries. A huge mistake many people make is
to invest a high percentage of their funds in their employer’s stock. Then, if the
company goes bankrupt, they lose not only their job but also their invested capi-
tal. Although no stock is completely riskless, you can smooth out the bumps
somewhat by holding a well-diversified portfolio.
3. Real returns are what matters. All investors should understand the difference be-
tween nominal and real returns. When assessing performance, the real return
(what you have left after inflation) is what really matters. It follows that, as ex-
pected inflation increases, investors need to earn higher nominal returns.
4. The risk of an investment often depends on how long you plan to hold the investment.
Common stocks, for example, can be extremely risky for short-term investors.
However, over the long haul the bumps tend to even out, so stocks are less risky
when held as part of a long-term portfolio. Indeed, in his best-selling book Stocks
for the Long Run, Jeremy Siegel of the University of Pennsylvania concludes:
“The safest long-term investment for the preservation of purchasing power has
clearly been stocks, not bonds."
5. The past gives us insights into the risk and returns on various investments, but
there is no guarantee that the future will repeat the past. Stocks that have performed
well in recent years might tumble, while stocks that have struggled may rebound.
254
Part 3: Stocks and Options

The same thing can hold true for the stock market as a whole. Even Jeremy Siegel,
who has preached that stocks have historically been good long-term investments,
has also argued that there is no assurance that returns in the future will be as strong
as they have been in the past. More importantly, when purchasing a stock you al-
ways need to ask: “Is this stock fairly valued, or is it currently priced too high?” We
discuss this issue more completely in the next chapter.

Explain the following statement: “The stand-alone risk of an individual corporate
project may be quite high, but viewed in the context of its effect on stockholders’
risk, the project’s true risk may be much lower."
How does the correlation between returns on a project and returns on the firm’s
other assets affect the project’s risk?
What are some important concepts for individual investors to consider when
evaluating the risk and returns of various investments?
Summary
This chapter focuses on the trade-off between risk and return. We began by discussing
how to estimate risk and return for both individual assets and portfolios. In particular,
we differentiated between stand-alone risk and risk in a portfolio context, and we ex-
plained the benefits of diversification. Finally, we introduced the CAPM, which de-
scribes how risk affects rates of return. In the chapters that follow, we will give you the
tools to estimate the required rates of return for bonds, preferred stock, and common
stock, and we will explain how firms use these rates of return to estimate their costs of
capital. As you will see, the cost of capital is a basic element in the capital budgeting pro-
cess. The key concepts covered in this chapter are listed below.
•
Risk can be defined as the chance that some unfavorable event will occur.
•
The risk of an asset’s cash flows can be considered on a stand-alone basis (each
asset all by itself) or in a portfolio context, in which the investment is combined
with other assets and its risk is reduced through diversification.
•
Most rational investors hold portfolios of assets, and they are more concerned
with the risk of their portfolios than with the risk of individual assets.
•
The expected return on an investment is the mean value of its probability dis-
tribution of returns.
•
The greater the probability that the actual return will be far below the ex-
pected return, the greater the asset’s stand-alone risk.
•
The average investor is risk averse, which means that he or she must be com-
pensated for holding risky assets. Therefore, riskier assets have higher required
returns than less risky assets.
•
An asset’s risk has two components: (1) diversifiable risk, which can be eliminated by
diversification, and (2) market risk, which cannot be eliminated by diversification.
•
Market risk is measured by the standard deviation of returns on a well-diversified
portfolio, one that consists of all stocks traded in the market. Such a portfolio is
called the market portfolio.
•
The relevant risk of an individual asset is its contribution to the risk of a well-
diversified portfolio. Since market risk cannot be eliminated by diversification,
investors must be compensated for bearing it.
•
A stock’s beta coefficient, b, is a measure of its market risk. Beta measures the
extent to which the stock’s returns move relative to the market.
Chapter 6: Risk, Return, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model
255

•
A high-beta stock has stock returns that tend to move up and down by more
than the returns on an average stock, while the opposite is true for a low-beta
stock. An average stock has b = 1.0, as does the market portfolio.
•
The beta of a portfolio is a weighted average of the betas of the individual
securities in the portfolio.
•
The Security Market Line (SML) equation shows the relationship between a
security’s market risk and its required rate of return. The return required for any
security i is equal to the risk-free rate plus the market risk premium
multiplied by the security’s beta: ri = rRF + (RPM)bi.
•
In equilibrium, the expected rate of return on a stock must equal its required
return. However, a number of things can happen to cause the required rate of
return to change: (1) the risk-free rate can change because of changes in either
real rates or expected inflation, (2) a stock’s beta can change, and (3) investors’
aversion to risk can change.
•
Because returns on assets in different countries are not perfectly correlated,
global diversification may result in lower risk for multinational companies and
globally diversified portfolios.

The CAPM is conceptually based on expected returns. However, only histori-
cal returns are available to test it. Various tests have been conducted, and none
has “proved” that the CAPM actually describes how investors behave. Indeed,
evidence exists to suggest that investors regard factors other than just beta when
analyzing risk. The 2008–2009 market crash suggests that, in addition to risk as
measured by beta, liquidity is important as well.

Two web extensions accompany this chapter: Web Extension 6A provides a dis-
cussion of continuous probability distributions, and Web Extension 6B shows
how to calculate beta with a financial calculator.

a. Use the data given to calculate annual returns for Bartman, Reynolds, and the
Market Index, and then calculate average annual returns for the two stocks and the
index. (Hint: Remember, returns are calculated by subtracting the beginning price
from the ending price to get the capital gain or loss, adding the dividend to the
capital gain or loss, and then dividing the result by the beginning price. Assume
that dividends are already included in the index. Also, you cannot calculate the rate
of return for 2005 because you do not have 2004 data.)
b. Calculate the standard deviations of the returns for Bartman, Reynolds, and the
Market Index. (Hint: Use the sample standard deviation formula given in the
chapter, which corresponds to the STDEV function in Excel.)
c. Now calculate the coefficients of variation for Bartman, Reynolds, and the Mar-
ket Index.
d. Construct a scatter diagram graph that shows Bartman’s returns on the vertical
axis and the Market Index’s returns on the horizontal axis. Construct a similar
graph showing Reynolds’s stock returns on the vertical axis.
e. Estimate Bartman’s and Reynolds’s betas as the slopes of regression lines with stock
return on the vertical axis (y-axis) and market return on the horizontal axis (x-axis).
(Hint: Use Excel’s SLOPE function.) Are these betas consistent with your graph?
f. The risk-free rate on long-term Treasury bonds is 6.04%. Assume that the
market risk premium is 5%. What is the required return on the market?
Now use the SML equation to calculate the two companies’ required returns.
g. If you formed a portfolio that consisted of 50% Bartman stock and 50% Rey-
nolds stock, what would be its beta and its required return?
h. Suppose an investor wants to include some Bartman Industries stock in his portfolio.
Stocks A, B, and C are currently in the portfolio, and their betas are 0.769,
0.985, and 1.423, respectively. Calculate the new portfolio’s required return if
it consists of 25% Bartman, 15% Stock A, 40% Stock B, and 20% Stock C.

CAPM to estimate required returns, we would ideally like to know how the stock will
move with the market in the future, but since we don’t have a crystal ball we gener-
ally use historical data to estimate this relationship.
As noted in the chapter, beta can be estimated by regressing the individual
stock’s returns against the returns of the overall market. As an alternative to run-
ning our own regressions, we can instead rely on reported betas from a variety of
sources. These published sources make it easy to obtain beta estimates for most
large publicly traded corporations. However, a word of caution is in order. Beta
estimates can often be quite sensitive to the time period in which the data are esti-
mated, the market index used, and the frequency of the data used. Therefore, it is
not uncommon to find a wide range of beta estimates among the various published
sources. Indeed, Thomson ONE reports multiple beta estimates. These multiple
estimates reflect the fact that Thomson ONE puts together data from a variety of
different sources.
Thomson ONE—BSE Discussion Questions
1. Begin by taking a look at the historical performance of the overall stock market.
If you want to see, for example, the performance of the S&P 500, select INDI-
CES and enter S&PCOMP. Click on PERFORMANCE and you will immedi-
ately see a quick summary of the market’s performance in recent months and
years. How has the market performed over the past year? The past 3 years? The
past 5 years? The past 10 years?
2. Now let’s take a closer look at the stocks of four companies: Colgate Palmolive
(CL), Gillette (G), Heinz (HNZ), and Microsoft (MSFT). Before looking at the
data, which of these companies would you expect to have a relatively high beta
(greater than 1.0), and which of these companies would you expect to have a
relatively low beta (less than 1.0)?
3. Select one of the four stocks listed in question 2 by selecting COMPANIES, en-
tering the company’s ticker symbol, and clicking on GO. On the overview page,
you should see a chart that summarizes how the stock has done relative to the
S&P 500 over the past 6 months. Has the stock outperformed or underper-
formed the overall market during this time period?
4. Return to the overview page for the stock you selected. If you scroll down
the page you should see an estimate of the company’s beta. What is the com-
pany’s beta? What was the source of the estimated beta?
5. Click on the tab labeled PRICES. What is the company’s current dividend yield?
What has been its total return to investors over the past 6 months? Over the past
year? Over the past 3 years? (Remember that total return includes the dividend
yield plus any capital gains or losses.)
6. What is the estimated beta on this page? What is the source of the estimated
beta? Why might different sources produce different estimates of beta? (Note:
if you want to see even more beta estimates, click OVERVIEWS on the sec-
ond line of tabs and then select SEC DATABASE MARKET DATA. Scroll
through the STOCK OVERVIEW SECTION and you will see a range of
different beta estimates.)
7. Select a beta estimate that you believe is best. (If you are not sure, you may want
to consider an average of the given estimates.) Assume that the risk-free rate is
5% and that the market risk premium is 6%. What is the required return on the
company’s stock?
262
Part 3: Stocks and Options

8. Repeat the same exercise for each of the three remaining companies. Do the
reported betas confirm your earlier intuition? In general, do you find that the
higher-beta stocks tend to do better in up markets and worse in down markets?
Explain.
Mini Case
Assume that you recently graduated with a major in finance and that you just landed a job as a
financial planner with Barney Smith Inc., a large financial services corporation. Your first
assignment is to invest $100,000 for a client. Because the funds are to be invested in a new
business that the client plans to start at the end of 1 year, you have been instructed to plan
for a 1-year holding period. Further, your boss has restricted you to the investment alterna-
tives shown in the table below. (Disregard for now the items at the bottom of the data; you
will fill in the blanks later.)
Barney Smith’s economic forecasting staff has developed probability estimates for the
state of the economy, and its security analysts have developed a sophisticated computer
program that was used to estimate the rate of return on each alternative under each
state of the economy. Alta Industries is an electronics firm; Repo Men Inc. collects
past-due debts; and American Foam manufactures mattresses and various other foam
products. Barney Smith also maintains an “index fund” that owns a market-weighted
fraction of all publicly traded stocks; you can invest in that fund and thus obtain
average stock market results. Given the situation as described, answer the following
questions.
a. What are investment returns? What is the return on an investment that costs $1,000
and is sold after 1 year for $1,100?

aNote that the estimated returns of American Foam do not always move in the same direction as the overall
economy. For example, when the economy is below average, consumers purchase fewer mattresses than
they would if the economy were stronger. However, if the economy is in a flat-out recession, a large number
of consumers who were planning to purchase a more expensive inner spring mattress may purchase, instead,
a cheaper foam mattress. Under these circumstances, we would expect American Foam’s stock price to be
higher if there is a recession than if the economy was just below average.

b. (1) Why is the T-bill’s return independent of the state of the economy? Do T-bills
promise a completely risk-free return? (2) Why are Alta Industries’s returns expected
to move with the economy whereas Repo Men’s are expected to move counter to
the economy?
c. Calculate the expected rate of return on each alternative and fill in the blanks in the row
for r^ in the table.
d. You should recognize that basing a decision solely on expected returns is appropriate
only for risk-neutral individuals. Because your client, like virtually everyone, is risk
averse, the riskiness of each alternative is an important aspect of the decision. One
possible measure of risk is the standard deviation of returns. (1) Calculate this value
for each alternative, and fill in the blank in the row for σ in the table. (2) What
type of risk is measured by the standard deviation? (3) Draw a graph that shows
roughly the shape of the probability distributions for Alta Industries, American
Foam, and T-bills.
e. Suppose you suddenly remembered that the coefficient of variation (CV) is generally
regarded as being a better measure of stand-alone risk than the standard deviation when
the alternatives being considered have widely differing expected returns. Calculate the
missing CVs, and fill in the blanks in the row for CV in the table. Does the CV pro-
duce the same risk rankings as the standard deviation?
f. Suppose you created a two-stock portfolio by investing $50,000 in Alta Industries and
$50,000 in Repo Men. (1) Calculate the expected return (r^p), the standard deviation
(σp), and the coefficient of variation (CVp) for this portfolio and fill in the appropri-
ate blanks in the table. (2) How does the risk of this two-stock portfolio compare
with the risk of the individual stocks if they were held in isolation?
g. Suppose an investor starts with a portfolio consisting of one randomly selected stock. As
more and more randomly selected stocks are added to the portfolio, what happens to
the portfolio’s risk and its expected return? What is the implication for investors?
Draw a graph of the two portfolios to illustrate your answer.
h. (1) Should portfolio effects influence how investors think about the risk of individual
stocks? (2) If you decided to hold a one-stock portfolio and consequently were exposed
to more risk than diversified investors, could you expect to be compensated for all of
your risk; that is, could you earn a risk premium on that part of your risk that you could
have eliminated by diversifying?
i. How is market risk measured for individual securities? How are beta coefficients
calculated?
j. Suppose you have the following historical returns for the stock market and for the
company P. Q. Unlimited. Explain how to calculate beta, and use the historical stock
returns to calculate the beta for PQU. Interpret your results.

k. The expected rates of return and the beta coefficients of the alternatives, as supplied by
Barney Smith’s computer program, are as follows:
(1) Do the expected returns appear to be related to each alternative’s market risk? (2) Is
it possible to choose among the alternatives on the basis of the information developed
thus far?
l. (1) Write out the Security Market Line (SML) equation, use it to calculate the required
rate of return on each alternative, and then graph the relationship between the expected
and required rates of return. (2) How do the expected rates of return compare with the
required rates of return? (3) Does it make sense that Repo Men has an expected return
that is less than the T-bill rate? (4) What would be the market risk and the required re-
turn of a 50-50 portfolio of Alta Industries and Repo Men? Of Alta Industries and
American Foam?
m. (1) Suppose investors raised their inflation expectations by 3 percentage points over
current estimates as reflected in the 8% T-bill rate. What effect would higher inflation
have on the SML and on the returns required on high- and low-risk securities? (2) Sup-
pose instead that investors’ risk aversion increased enough to cause the market risk pre-
mium to increase by 3 percentage points. (Assume inflation remains constant.) What
effect would this have on the SML and on returns of high- and low-risk securities?

T
he opening chart in Chapter 6 showed General Electric’s stock rising by
almost eight-fold from 1994 to 2000 but then, from 2000 to 2003,
experiencing a sickening fall, losing over half of its value. GE had
recovered about half of this decline by 2008, but then it plummeted again
and in early 2009 hit a 20-year low.
What led to those wild swings? In a nutshell, risk and expected cash
flows. Until 2000, GE was regarded as a low-risk company capable of
sustaining fast-growing cash flows. Investors’ perceptions of low risk and
high expected cash flow growth propelled it up, and investors’ subsequent
reduced expectations drove it down.
In this chapter we will see how stocks are valued in the marketplace.
For the most part, professional security analysts do the work, using the
techniques described in this chapter. “Sell side” analysts work for
investment banks and brokerages. They write reports that are distributed to
investors, generally through brokers. “Buy side” analysts work for mutual
funds, hedge funds, pension funds, and other institutional investors. Those
institutions obtain information from the buy-side analysts, but they also do
their own research and ignore the buy side if they disagree.
The analysts on both sides generally focus on specific industries, and
many of them were hired as analysts after working for a time in the industry
they cover. Physics PhDs are often electronics analysts, biologists analyze
biotech stocks, and so on. The analysts pore over financial statements, but
they also go on the road and talk with company officials, companies’
customers, and their suppliers. The point of all this work is to try to predict
corporate earnings, dividends, and free cash flow—and thus stock prices.
How good are analysts’ predictions and hence their ability to forecast
stock prices? A look back at the opening chart in Chapter 6 would suggest
“not very good”—if they had seen the crash coming then they would have
sold before the peaks and bought at the troughs, thus smoothing out the
graphs. However, some analysts are better than others, and the material in
this chapter can help you be better than average.

In Chapter 6 we examined stocks’ risks and the factors that affect their required re-
turns. In this chapter we use those findings to estimate the intrinsic value of a stock.
The concepts and models developed here will also be used when we estimate the cost
of capital in Chapter 9 a key concept used in many important decisions, especially de-
cisions to invest or not invest in new assets.
Some companies are so small that their common stocks are not actively traded; they are
owned by only a few people, usually the companies’ managers. The stock in such firms is
said to be closely held. In contrast, the stocks of most large companies are owned by many
investors, most of whom are not active in management. These are publicly held stocks.
Institutions such as pension plans, mutual funds, hedge funds, foreign investors, and insur-
ance companies hold about half the market value of all stocks and buy and sell relatively
actively. As a result, they account for about 75% of all transactions and thus have a heavy
influence on the valuation of individual stocks. But before plunging into stock valuation, it
is useful to begin with a closer look at what it means to be a stockholder.
7.1 LEGAL RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF COMMON
STOCKHOLDERS
The common stockholders are the owners of a corporation, and as such they have cer-
tain rights and privileges as discussed in this section.
Corporate Valuation and Stock Prices
In Chapter 1, we told you that managers should strive to
maximize intrinsic value and that the value of a firm is
determined by the size, timing, and risk of its free cash
flows (FCF). Recall that one use of FCF is to pay dividends.
One way to estimate the intrinsic value of stock is to dis-
count the cash flows to stockholders (dividends, Dt) at the
rate of return required by stockholders (rs). The result is

Part 3: Stocks and Options

Control of the Firm
A firm’s common stockholders have the right to elect its directors, who, in turn, elect
the officers who manage the business. In a small firm, the largest stockholder typically
serves as president and chairperson of the board. In a large, publicly owned firm, the
managers typically have some stock, but their personal holdings are generally insuffi-
cient to give them voting control. Thus, the managers of most publicly owned firms
can be removed by the stockholders if the management team is not effective.
State and federal laws stipulate how stockholder control is to be exercised. First,
corporations must hold periodic elections to select directors, usually once a year,
with the vote taken at the annual meeting. Frequently, one-third of the directors
are elected each year for a 3-year term. Each share of stock has one vote, so the
owner of 1,000 shares has 1,000 votes for each director.1 Stockholders can appear at
the annual meeting and vote in person, but typically they transfer their right to vote
to another party by means of a proxy. Management always solicits stockholders’
proxies and usually gets them. However, if earnings are poor and stockholders are
dissatisfied, an outside group may solicit the proxies in an effort to overthrow man-
agement and take control of the business. This is known as a proxy fight. Proxy
fights are discussed in detail in Chapter 13.
The Preemptive Right
Common stockholders often have the right, called the preemptive right, to purchase
any additional shares sold by the firm. In some states, the preemptive right is auto-
matically included in every corporate charter; in others, it is used only if it is specifi-
cally inserted into the charter.
The preemptive right enables current stockholders to maintain control, and it also
prevents a transfer of wealth from current stockholders to new stockholders. If it were
not for this safeguard, the management of a corporation could issue additional shares at
a low price and purchase these shares itself. Management could thereby seize control of
the corporation and steal value from the current stockholders. For example, suppose 1,000
shares of common stock, each with a price of $100, were outstanding, making the total
market value of the firm $100,000. If an additional 1,000 shares were sold at $50 a share,
or for $50,000, this would raise the total market value to $150,000. When total market
value is divided by new total shares outstanding, a value of $75 a share is obtained. The
old stockholders thus lose $25 per share, and the new stockholders have an instant profit
of $25 per share. Thus, selling common stock at a price below the market value would
dilute its price and transfer wealth from the present stockholders to those who were al-
lowed to purchase the new shares. The preemptive right prevents such occurrences.

7.2 TYPES OF COMMON STOCK
Although most firms have only one type of common stock, in some instances classi-
fied stock is used to meet a company’s special needs. Generally, when special
1In the situation described, a 1,000-share stockholder could cast 1,000 votes for each of three directors if
there were three contested seats on the board. An alternative procedure that may be prescribed in the cor-
porate charter calls for cumulative voting. Here the 1,000-share stockholder would get 3,000 votes if there
were three vacancies, and he or she could cast all of them for one director. Cumulative voting helps mi-
nority stockholders (i.e., those who do not own a majority of the shares) get representation on the board.
Chapter 7: Stocks, Stock Valuation, and Stock Market Equilibrium

classifications are used, one type is designated Class A, another Class B, and so on.
Small, new companies seeking funds from outside sources frequently use different
types of common stock. For example, when Genetic Concepts went public, its Class
A stock was sold to the public and paid a dividend, but this stock had no voting rights
for 5 years. Its Class B stock, which was retained by the firm’s organizers, had full
voting rights for 5 years, but the legal terms stated that dividends could not be paid
on the Class B stock until the company had established its earning power and built
up retained earnings to a designated level. The use of classified stock thus enabled
the public to take a position in a conservatively financed growth company without
sacrificing income, while the founders retained absolute control during the crucial
early stages of the firm’s development. At the same time, outside investors were pro-
tected against excessive withdrawals of funds by the original owners. As is often the
case in such situations, the Class B stock was called founders’ shares.2
As these examples illustrate, the right to vote is often a distinguishing characteris-
tic between different classes of stock. Suppose two classes of stock differ in only one
respect: One class has voting rights but the other does not. As you would expect, the
stock with voting rights would be more valuable. In the United States, which has a
legal system with fairly strong protection for minority stockholders (that is, noncon-
trolling stockholders), voting stock typically sells at a price 4% to 6% above that of
otherwise similar nonvoting stock. Thus, if a stock with no voting rights sold for $50,
then one with voting rights would probably sell for $52 to $53. In countries with le-
gal systems that provide less protection for minority stockholders, the right to vote is
far more valuable. For example, voting stock on average sells for 45% more than
nonvoting stock in Israel and for 82% more in Italy.
Some companies have multiple lines of business, with each line having very differ-
ent growth prospects. Because cash flows for all business lines are mingled on finan-
cial statements, some companies worry that investors are not able to value the high-
growth business lines correctly. To separate the cash flows and to allow separate va-
luations, occasionally a company will have classes of stock with dividends tied to a
particular part of a company. This is called tracking stock, or target stock. For ex-
ample, in 2002 Loews Corporation, a holding company with property and casualty
insurance, oil and gas drilling, and tobacco subsidiaries, issued Carolina Group track-
ing stock tied to the performance of its Lorillard tobacco subsidiary.
However, many analysts are skeptical as to whether tracking stock increases a
company’s total market value. Companies still report consolidated financial state-
ments for the entire company and have considerable leeway in allocating costs, de-
ploying capital, and reporting the financial results for the various divisions, even
those with tracking stock. Thus, a tracking stock is far from identical to the stock of
an independent, stand-alone company.

7.3 THE MARKET STOCK PRICE VERSUS INTRINSIC VALUE
We saw in Chapter 1 that managers should seek to maximize the value of their firms’
stocks. In that chapter, we also emphasized the difference between stock price and
intrinsic value. The stock price is simply the current market price, and it is easily ob-
served for publicly traded companies. By contrast, intrinsic value, which represents

shares, but a firm that does could designate its Class B shares as founders’ shares and its Class A shares
as those sold to the public and another firm might reverse these designations.

the “true” value of the company’s stock, cannot be directly observed and must instead
be estimated. Figure 7-1 illustrates the connection between stock price and intrinsic
value.
As the figure suggests, market equilibrium occurs when the stock’s price equals its
intrinsic value. If the stock market is reasonably efficient, then gaps between the
stock price and intrinsic value should not be very large and they should not persist
for very long. However, there are cases when an individual stock price may be
much higher or lower than its intrinsic value, and such divergence may persist for
quite a while. During several years leading up to the crash of 2008–2009, most of
the large investment banks were reporting record profits and selling at record prices.
However, much of those earnings were illusory in that they did not reflect the huge
risks that existed in the sub-prime mortgages they were buying. So, with hindsight,
we now know that the market prices of most financial firms’ stocks exceeded their
intrinsic values just prior to 2008. Then, when the market realized what was happen-
ing, those stock prices crashed. Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and others lost over 80%
of their value in a few short months, and others suffered even worse declines. It
clearly pays to question market prices at times!
Why Do Investors and Companies Care about
Intrinsic Value?
The remainder of this chapter focuses primarily on different approaches for estimat-
ing a stock’s intrinsic value. Before describing these approaches, it is worth asking
why it is important for investors and companies to understand how to estimate in-
trinsic values.
When investing in common stocks, the goal is to purchase stocks that are under-
valued (i.e., the price is below the stock’s intrinsic value) and avoid stocks that are
overvalued. Consequently, Wall Street analysts, institutional investors who control
mutual funds and pension funds, and even many individual investors are quite inter-
ested in finding reliable models that help predict intrinsic value. Investors obviously
care about intrinsic value, but managers also must understand how intrinsic value is

estimated. First, managers need to know how alternative actions are likely to affect
stock prices, and the models of intrinsic value that we cover help demonstrate the
connection between managerial decisions and firm value. Second, managers should
consider whether their stock is significantly undervalued or overvalued before making
certain decisions. For example, firms should consider carefully the decision to issue
new shares if they believe their stock is undervalued, and an estimate of their stock’s
intrinsic value is the key to such decisions.
Two basic models are used to estimate intrinsic values: the discounted dividend model
and the corporate valuation model. The dividend model focuses on dividends, while the
corporate model drills down below dividends and focuses on sales, costs, and free
cash flows. We cover the discounted dividend model in this chapter and the corpo-
rate valuation model in Chapter 13.

firms’ offices watching a “ticker tape” go by that displayed prices of stocks as they
were traded. Those who did not need current information could find the previous

Journal. Today, though, one can get quotes throughout the day from many differ-
ent Internet sources, including Yahoo!.3 Figure 7-2 shows the quote for General
Electric, which is traded on the NYSE under the symbol GE, on February 13,

was a 2.05% decline from the previous day. However, the stock rose by 9 cents in
after-hours trading. The data also show that GE opened the day at $11.55 and

7.5 VALUING COMMON STOCKS
Common stocks are expected to provide a stream of future cash flows, and a stock’s
value is found the same way as the values of other financial assets—namely, as the
present value of its expected future cash flow stream. The expected cash flows consist
of two elements: (1) the dividends expected in each year and (2) the price investors
expect to receive when they sell the stock. The expected final stock price includes
the return of the original investment plus an expected capital gain.
Definitions of Terms Used in Stock Valuation Models
We saw in Chapter 1 that a manager should seek to maximize the intrinsic value of
the firm’s stock. To do this, a manager needs to know how her actions are likely to
affect the stock’s price. Therefore, we develop some models in this section to show
how the value of a share of stock is determined, and we begin by defining some key
terms as follows.
Dt = Dividend the stockholder expects to receive at the end of Year t. D0 is the
most recent dividend, which has already been paid; D1 is the first dividend
expected, which will be paid at the end of this year; D2 is the dividend
expected at the end of Year 2; and so forth. D1 represents the first cash
flow that a new purchaser of the stock will receive, because D0 has just
been paid. D0 is known with certainty, but all future dividends are
expected values, so the estimate of Dt may differ among investors.4
P0 = Actual market price of the stock today.
4Stocks generally pay dividends quarterly, so theoretically we should evaluate them on a quarterly basis.
However, in stock valuation, most analysts work on an annual basis because the data generally are not
precise enough to warrant refinement to a quarterly model. For additional information on the quarterly
model, see Charles M. Linke and J. Kenton Zumwalt, “Estimation Biases in Discounted Cash Flow Anal-
ysis of Equity Capital Cost in Rate Regulation,” Financial Management, Autumn 1984, pp. 15–21. Also see
Robert Brooks and Billy Helms, “An N-Stage, Fractional Period, Quarterly Dividend Discount Model,”
Financial Review, November 1990, pp. 651–657.
Chapter 7: Stocks, Stock Valuation, and Stock Market Equilibrium
273

^Pt = Expected price of the stock at the end of each Year t (pronounced
“P hat t”). ^P0 is the intrinsic, or fundamental, value of the stock today as
seen by the particular investor doing the analysis; ^P1 is the price expected
at the end of one year; and so on. Note that ^P0 is the intrinsic value of the
stock today based on a particular investor’s estimate of the stock’s expected
dividend stream and the risk of that stream. Hence, whereas the market
price P0 is fixed and is identical for all investors, ^P0 could differ among
investors depending on how optimistic they are regarding the company.
The caret, or “hat,” is used to indicate that ^Pt is an estimated future value.
^P0, the individual investor’s estimate of the intrinsic value today, could be
above or below P0, the current stock price, but an investor would buy
the stock only if his estimate of ^P0 were equal to or greater than P0.
Since there are many investors in the market, there can be many
values for ^P0. However, we can think of a group of “average,” or
“marginal,” investors whose actions actually determine the market
price. For these marginal investors, P0 must equal ^P0; otherwise, a
disequilibrium would exist, and buying and selling in the market would
cause P0 to change until P0 = ^P0 as seen by the marginal investor.
D1/P0 = Expected dividend yield during the coming year. If the stock is
expected to pay a dividend of D1 = $1 during the next 12 months
and if its current price is P0 = $10, then the expected dividend yield
is $1/$10 = 0.10 = 10%.
^P1 −P0
P0
= Expected capital gains yield during the coming year. If the stock sells
for $10 today and if it is expected to rise to $10.50 at the end of one
year, then the expected capital gain is ^P1 −P0 = $10.50 −$10.00 = $0.50,
and the expected capital gains yield is $0.50/$10 = 0.05 = 5%.
g = Expected growth rate in dividends as predicted by a marginal investor. If
dividends are expected to grow at a constant rate, then g is also the expected
rate of growth in earnings and the stock’s price. Different investors may use
different values of g to evaluate a firm’s stock, but the market price, P0, is
set on the basis of g as estimated by the marginal investor.
rs = Minimum acceptable return, or required rate of return, on the stock,
considering both its risk and the returns available on other investments.
Again, this term generally relates to the marginal investor. The primary
determinants of rs include the real rate of return, expected inflation,
and risk.
^rs = Expected rate of return that an investor who buys the stock expects to
receive in the future. ^rs (pronounced “r hat s”) could be above or below
rs, but one would buy the stock only if ^rs ≥rs. Note that the expected
return (^rs) is equal to the expected dividend yield (D1/P0) plus the
expected capital gains yield ([^P1 −P0]/P0). In our example, ^rs = 10% +
5% = 15%.
¯rs = Actual, or realized, after-the-fact rate of return, pronounced “r bar s.”
You may expect to obtain a return of ^rs = 15% if you buy ExxonMobil
today, but if the market declines then you may end up next year with an
actual realized return that is much lower and perhaps even negative.
274
Part 3: Stocks and Options

Expected Dividends as the Basis for Stock Values
Like all financial assets, the value of a stock is estimated by finding the present value
of a stream of expected future cash flows. What are the cash flows that corporations
are expected to provide to their stockholders? First, think of yourself as an investor
who buys a stock with the intention of holding it (in your family) forever. In this
case, all that you (and your heirs) will receive is a stream of dividends, and the value
of the stock today is calculated as the present value of an infinite stream of dividends:
Value of stock ¼ ^P0 ¼ PV of expected future dividends

D2
ð1 þ rsÞ2 þ … þ
D∞
ð1 þ rsÞ∞
¼∑
∞
t¼1
Dt
ð1 þ rsÞt
(7-1)
What about the more typical case, where you expect to hold the stock for a finite
period and then sell it—what is the value of ^P0 in this case? Unless the company is
likely to be liquidated or sold and thus to disappear, the value of the stock is again de-
termined by Equation 7-1. To see this, recognize that for any individual investor, the
expected cash flows consist of expected dividends plus the expected sale price of the
stock. However, the sale price a current investor receives will depend on the divi-
dends some future investor expects. Therefore, for all present and future investors
in total, expected cash flows must be based on expected future dividends. Put another
way, unless a firm is liquidated or sold to another concern, the cash flows it provides
to its stockholders will consist only of a stream of dividends. Therefore, the value of a
share of its stock must be the present value of that expected dividend stream.
The general validity of Equation 7-1 can also be confirmed by solving the follow-
ing problem. Suppose I buy a stock and expect to hold it for 1 year. I will receive
dividends during the year plus the value ^P1 when I sell at the end of the year. But
what will determine the value of ^P1? The answer is that it will be determined as the
present value of the dividends expected during Year 2 plus the stock price at the end
of that year, which, in turn, will be determined as the present value of another set of
future dividends and an even more distant stock price. This process can be continued
ad infinitum, and the ultimate result is Equation 7-1.5

5It is ironic that investors periodically lose sight of the long-run nature of stocks as investments and for-
get that, in order to sell a stock at a profit, one must find a buyer who will pay the higher price. If you
analyze a stock’s value in accordance with Equation 7-1, conclude that the stock’s market price exceeds a
reasonable value, and then buy the stock anyway, then you would be following the “bigger fool” theory of
investment—you think that you may be a fool to buy the stock at its excessive price, but you think that
when you get ready to sell it, you can find someone who is an even bigger fool. The bigger fool theory
was widely followed in the spring of 2000, just before the Nasdaq market lost more than one-third of its
value.

7.6 VALUING A CONSTANT GROWTH STOCK
Equation 7-1 is a generalized stock valuation model in that the time pattern of Dt can
be anything: Dt can be rising, falling, fluctuating randomly, or even zero for several
years, yet Equation 7-1 will still hold. With a computer spreadsheet we can easily use
this equation to find a stock’s intrinsic value for any pattern of dividends.6 In prac-
tice, the hard part is getting an accurate forecast of the future dividends. However,
in many cases the stream of dividends is expected to grow at a constant rate, and if
so then Equation 7-1 can be rewritten as follows:
^P0 ¼ D0ð1 þ gÞ1
ð1 þ rsÞ1 þ D0ð1 þ gÞ2
ð1 þ rsÞ2 þ … þ D0ð1 þ gÞ∞
ð1 þ rsÞ∞
¼ D0 ∑
∞
t¼1
ð1 þ gÞt
ð1 þ rsÞt
¼ D0ð1 þ gÞ
rs −g
¼ D1
rs −g
(7-2)
The last term of Equation 7-2 is called the constant growth model, or the Gordon
model, after Myron J. Gordon, who did much to develop and popularize it.
A necessary condition for the validity of Equation 7-2 is that rs be greater than g. Look
back at the second form of Equation 7-2. If g is larger than rs, then (1 + g)t/(1 + rs)t must
always be greater than 1. In this case, the second line of Equation 7-2 is the sum of an
infinite number of terms, with each term being larger than 1. Therefore, if rs were con-
stant and greater than g, the resulting stock price would be infinite! Since no company is
worth an infinite amount, it is impossible to have a constant growth rate that is greater
than rs forever. Similarly, a student will occasionally plug a value for g that is greater
than rs into the last form of Equation 7-2 and report a negative stock price. This is non-
sensical. The last form of Equation 7-2 is valid only when g is less than rs. If g is greater
than rs then the constant growth model cannot be used, and the answer you would get from using
Equation 7-2 would be wrong and misleading.
Illustration of a Constant Growth Stock
Assume that MicroDrive just paid a dividend of $1.15 (that is, D0 = $1.15). Its stock
has a required rate of return, rs, of 13.4%, and investors expect the dividend to grow
at a constant 8% rate in the future. The estimated dividend 1 year hence would be
D1 = $1.15(1.08) = $1.24; D2 would be $1.34; and the estimated dividend 5 years
hence would be $1.69:
Dt ¼ D0ð1 þ gÞt ¼ $1:15ð1:08Þ5 ¼ $1:69
We could use this procedure to estimate each future dividend and then use Equa-
tion 7-1 to determine the current stock value, ^P0. In other words, we could find
each expected future dividend, calculate its present value, and then sum all the
present values to find the intrinsic value of the stock.
Such a process would be time-consuming, but we can take a shortcut—just insert
the illustrative data into Equation 7-2 to find the stock’s intrinsic value, $23:
6Actually, we can only find an approximate price. However, if we project dividends for 100 or so years,
the present value of that finite dividend stream is approximately equal to the present value of the infinite
dividend stream.

graphed in Figure 7-3. Dividends are growing at the rate g = 8%, but because rs > g,
the present value of each future dividend is declining. For example, the dividend in
Year 1 is D1 = D0(1 + g)1 = $1.15(1.08) = $1.242. However, the present value of this
dividend, discounted at 13.4%, is PV(D1) = $1.242/(1.134)1 = $1.095. The dividend
expected in Year 2 grows to $1.242(1.08) = $1.341, but the present value of this divi-
dend falls to $1.043. Continuing, D3 = $1.449 and PV(D3) = $0.993, and so on. Thus,
the expected dividends are growing, but the present value of each successive dividend
is declining, because the dividend growth rate (8%) is less than the rate used for dis-
counting the dividends to the present (13.4%).
If we summed the present values of each future dividend, this summation would be
the value of the stock, ^P0. When g is a constant, this summation is equal to D1/(rs −g),
as shown in Equation 7-2. Therefore, if we extended the lower step-function curve in
Figure 7-3 on out to infinity and added up the present values of each future dividend,
the summation would be identical to the value given by Equation 7-2, $23.00.
Although Equation 7-2 assumes there are infinite time periods, most of the value is
based on dividends during a finite time period. In our example, 70% of the value is
attributed to the first 25 years, 91% to the first 50 years, and 99.4% to the first 100
years. This means that companies don’t have to survive forever to justify using the
Gordon growth model.

Dividend and Earnings Growth
Because a stock price depends on all future dividends, not just next year’s dividend,
increasing next year’s dividend will not have much impact on stock price unless in-
vestors expect the dividend increase to be sustainable. Dividends are paid with cash,
which means sustainable dividend growth must come from sustainable cash flow
growth. The cash flow that is available for distribution to shareholders depends on
profitability, investments in operating capital, and the level of debt. Dividends, prof-
itability, capital investments, and capital structure are all interrelated, especially in the
long term. A dollar used to pay dividends can’t be used for reinvestment in the firm
or to pay down debt, so everything else equal, higher dividends must be associated
with lower growth or a higher debt level. Growth in dividends can be supported by
increasing debt, but to avoid unacceptably high levels of debt, long-term dividend
growth must be limited to long-term earnings growth.
Earnings per share (EPS) growth depends on economy-wide factors (such as reces-
sions and inflation), industry-wide factors (such as technological innovations), and
firm-specific factors (management skill, brand identity, patent protection, etc.). For
a firm to grow faster than the economy, either the industry must become a bigger
part of the economy or the firm must take market share from its competitors. In
the long run, competition and market saturation will tend to limit EPS growth to
the sum of population growth and inflation. And as we just explained, the long-term
dividend growth rate cannot exceed the long-term EPS growth rate.
Do Stock Prices Reflect Long-Term or Short-Term Events?
Managers often complain that the stock market is shortsighted and that investors care
only about conditions over the next few years. Let’s use the constant growth model
to test this assertion. MicroDrive’s most recent dividend was $1.15, and it is expected
to grow at a rate of 8% per year. Since we know the growth rate, we can forecast the
dividends for each of the next 5 years and then find their present values:

ð1:134Þ5
¼ 1:095 þ 1:043 þ 0:993 þ 0:946 þ 0:901
≈$5:00
Recall that MicroDrive’s stock price is $23.00. Therefore, only $5.00, or $5/$23 =
0.22 = 22%, of the $23.00 stock price is attributable to short-term cash flows. This
means that MicroDrive’s managers will affect the stock price more by working to in-
crease long-term cash flows than by focusing on short-term flows. This situation
holds for most companies. Indeed, a number of professors and consulting firms
have used actual company data to show that more than 80% of a typical company’s
stock price is due to cash flows expected farther than 5 years in the future.
This brings up an interesting question. If most of a stock’s value is due to long-term
cash flows, then why do managers and analysts pay so much attention to quarterly
earnings? Part of the answer lies in the information conveyed by short-term earnings.
278
Part 3: Stocks and Options

For example, when actual quarterly earnings are lower than expected not because of
fundamental problems but only because a company has increased its research and devel-
opment (R&D) expenditures, studies have shown that the stock price probably won’t
decline and may actually increase. This makes sense, because R&D should increase fu-
ture cash flows. On the other hand, if quarterly earnings are lower than expected because
customers don’t like the company’s new products, then this new information will have
negative implications for future values of g, the long-term growth rate. As we show later
in this chapter, even small changes in g can lead to large changes in stock prices. There-
fore, quarterly earnings themselves might not be that important, but the information
they convey about future prospects can be extremely important.
Another reason many managers focus on short-term earnings is that some firms
pay managerial bonuses on the basis of current earnings rather than stock prices
(which reflect future earnings). For these managers, the concern with quarterly earn-
ings is not due to their effect on stock prices—it’s due to their effect on bonuses.7
When Can the Constant Growth Model Be Used?
The constant growth model is most appropriate for mature companies with a stable
history of growth. Expected growth rates vary somewhat among companies, but divi-
dend growth for most mature firms is generally expected to continue in the future at
about the same rate as nominal gross domestic product (real GDP plus inflation). On
this basis, one might expect the dividends of an average, or “normal,” company to
grow at a rate of 5% to 8% a year. Note, though, that the 2008–2009 recession has
caused many analysts to lower their expectations for long-run growth, and those low-
ered expectations contributed mightily to the stock market crash.
Note too that Equation 7-2 is sufficiently general to handle the case of a zero
growth stock, where the dividend is expected to remain constant over time. If g = 0,
then Equation 7-2 reduces to Equation 7-3:
^P0 ¼ D
rs
(7-3)
This is essentially the equation for a perpetuity, and it is simply the dividend divided
by the discount rate.

dividends were 4%? ($25.00) What would the price be if g = 0%? ($16.67)
7.7 EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON A CONSTANT
GROWTH STOCK
When using Equation 7-2, we first estimated D0 and rs, the required rate of return on
the stock; then we solved for the stock’s intrinsic value, which we compared to its
actual market price. We can also reverse the process, observing the actual stock price,
7Many apparent puzzles in finance can be explained either by managerial compensation systems or by pe-
culiar features of the Tax Code. So, if you can’t explain a firm’s behavior in terms of economic logic, look
to compensation procedures or taxes as possible explanations.
Chapter 7: Stocks, Stock Valuation, and Stock Market Equilibrium
279

substituting it into Equation 7-2, and solving for the rate of return. In doing so, we
are finding the expected rate of return, which will also equal the required rate of re-
turn, ^rs = rs, if the market is in equilibrium:8
r^s ¼ Expected rate
of return
¼
Expected
dividend yield þ Expected capital
gains yield
¼
Expected
dividend yield þ
Expected
growth rate
¼ D1
P0
þ g
(7-4)
Thus, if you buy a stock for a price P0 = $23, and if you expect the stock to pay a
dividend D1 = $1.242 one year from now and to grow at a constant rate g = 8% in
the future, then your expected rate of return will be 13.4%:
^rs ¼ $1:242
$23
þ 8% ¼ 5:4% þ 8% ¼ 13:4%
In this form, we see that ^rs is the expected total return and that it consists of an expected
dividend yield, D1/P0 = 5.4%, plus an expected growth rate (which is also the expected
capital gains yield) of g = 8%.
Suppose that the current price, P0, is equal to $23 and that the Year-1 expected
dividend, D1, is equal to $1.242. What is the expected price at the end of the
first year, immediately after D1 has been paid? First, we can estimate the expected
Year-2 dividend as D2 = D1(1 + g) = $1.242(1.08) = $1.3414. Then we can apply a
version of Equation 7-2 that is shifted ahead by 1 year, using D2 instead of D1 and
solving for ^P1 instead of ^P0:
^P1 ¼ D2
rs −g ¼
$1:3414
0:134 −0:08 ¼ $24:84
Even easier, notice that ^P1 must be 8% larger than $23, the price found 1 year earlier
for P0:
$23ð1:08Þ ¼ $24:84
Either way, we expect a capital gain of $24.84 −$23.00 = $1.84 during the year,
which is a capital gains yield of 8%:
Capital gains yield ¼
Capital gain
Beginning price ¼ $1:84
$23:00 ¼ 0:08 ¼ 8%
We could extend the analysis, and in each future year the expected capital gains yield
would always equal g, the expected dividend growth rate.
The dividend yield during the year could be estimated as follows:
Dividend yield ¼ D2
^P1
¼ $1:3414
$24:84 ¼ 0:054 ¼ 5:4%
The dividend yield for the following year could also be calculated, and again it would
be 5.4%. Thus, for a constant growth stock, the following conditions must hold.
8We say that a stock is in equilibrium when rs ¼ ^rs and ^P0 ¼ P0. We discuss this in more detail later in
the chapter.

1. The dividend is expected to grow forever at a constant rate, g.
2. The stock price will also grow at this same rate.
3. The expected dividend yield is constant.
4. The expected capital gains yield is also constant and is equal to g, the dividend
(and stock price) growth rate.
5. The expected total rate of return, ^rs, is equal to the expected dividend yield plus
the expected growth rate: ^rs = dividend yield + g.
The term expected should be clarified—it means “expected” in a probabilistic sense, as
the “statistically expected” outcome. Thus, if we say the growth rate is expected to
remain constant at 8%, we mean that the best prediction for the growth rate in any
future year is 8%, not that we literally expect the growth rate to be exactly 8% in
each future year. In this sense, the constant growth assumption is a reasonable one
for many large, mature companies.

7.8 VALUING NONCONSTANT GROWTH STOCKS
For many companies, it is not appropriate to assume that dividends will grow at a
constant rate. Firms typically go through life cycles. During their early years, their
growth is much faster than that of the economy as a whole; then they match the
economy’s growth; and finally their growth is slower than that of the economy.9 Au-
tomobile manufacturers in the 1920s, software companies such as Microsoft in the
1990s, and technology firms such as Cisco in the 2000s are examples of firms in the
early part of the cycle; these firms are called supernormal, or nonconstant, growth
firms. Figure 7-4 illustrates nonconstant growth and also compares it with normal
growth, zero growth, and negative growth.10
In Figure 7-4, the dividends of the supernormal growth firm are expected to grow
at a 30% rate for 3 years, after which the growth rate is expected to fall to 8%, the
assumed average for the economy. The value of this firm, like any other, is the pres-
ent value of its expected future dividends as determined by Equation 7-1. When Dt is
growing at a constant rate, we simplify Equation 7-1 to ^P0 = D1/(rs −g). In the su-
pernormal case, however, the expected growth rate is not a constant—it declines at
the end of the supernormal growth period.
9The concept of life cycles could be broadened to product cycle, which would include both small start-up
companies and large companies like Apple, which periodically introduce new products that give sales and
earnings a boost. We should also mention business cycles, which alternately depress and boost sales and
profits. The growth rate just after a major new product has been introduced, or just after a firm emerges
from the depths of a recession, is likely to be much higher than the “expected long-run average growth
rate,” which is the number that should be used in a DCF analysis.
10A negative growth rate indicates a declining company. A mining company whose profits are falling be-
cause of a declining ore body is an example. Someone buying such a company would expect its earnings,
and consequently its dividends and stock price, to decline each year, and this would lead to capital losses
rather than capital gains. Obviously, a declining company’s stock price will be relatively low, and its divi-
dend yield must be high enough to offset the expected capital loss and still produce a competitive total re-
turn. Students sometimes argue that they would never be willing to buy a stock whose price was expected
to decline. However, if the annual dividends are large enough to more than offset the falling stock price,
the stock could still provide a good return.
Chapter 7: Stocks, Stock Valuation, and Stock Market Equilibrium
281

Because Equation 7-2 requires a constant growth rate, we obviously cannot use it
to value stocks that have nonconstant growth. However, assuming a company cur-
rently enjoying supernormal growth will eventually slow down and become a con-
stant growth stock, we can use Equation 7-2 to help find the stock’s value. First, we
assume that the dividend will grow at a nonconstant rate (generally a relatively high
rate) for N periods, after which it will grow at a constant rate, g. Often N is called
the horizon date or the terminal date.
Recall that a stock’s current intrinsic value, ^P0, is the present value of all dividends
after Time 0, discounted back to Time 0. Similarly, the intrinsic value of a stock at
Time N is the present value of all dividends beyond Time N, discounted back to
Time N. When dividends beyond Time N are expected to grow at a constant rate,
we can use a variation of the constant growth formula, Equation 7-2, to estimate the
stock’s intrinsic value at Time N. The intrinsic value at Time N is often called the
horizon value or the terminal value:
Horizon value ¼ ^PN ¼ DNþ1
rs −g ¼ DNð1 þ gÞ
rs −g
(7-5)
A stock’s intrinsic value today, ^P0, is the present value of the dividends during the
nonconstant growth period plus the present value of the dividends after the horizon
date:

The horizon value is the value of all dividends beyond Time N discounted back to
Time N. Discounting the horizon value from Time N to Time 0 provides an estimate of
the present value of all dividends beyond the nonconstant growth period. Thus, the
stock’s current intrinsic value is the present value of all dividends during the nonconstant
growth period plus the present value of the horizon value:

(7-6)
To implement Equation 7-6, we go through the following three steps.
1. Estimate the expected dividends for each year during the period of nonconstant
growth.
2. Find the expected price of the stock at the end of the nonconstant growth period,
at which point it has become a constant growth stock.
3. Find the present values of the expected dividends during the nonconstant growth
period and the present value of the expected stock price at the end of the non-
constant growth period. Their sum is the intrinsic value of the stock, ^P0.
To illustrate the process for valuing nonconstant growth stocks, we make the fol-
lowing assumptions.
rs = Stockholders’ required rate of return = 13.4%. This rate is used to
discount all the cash flows.
N = Years of supernormal growth = 3.
gs = Rate of growth in both earnings and dividends during the supernormal
growth period = 30%. This rate is shown directly on the time line. (Note:
The growth rate during the supernormal growth period could vary from
year to year. Also, there could be several different supernormal growth
periods—for example, 30% for 3 years, then 20% for 3 years, and then
a constant 8%.)
gL = Rate of normal, constant growth after the supernormal period = 8%. This
rate is also shown on the time line, between Periods 3 and 4.

Notes:
Step 1. Calculate the dividends expected at the end of each year during the nonconstant growth period. Calculate the first dividend,
D1 = D0(1 + gs) = $1.15(1.30) = $1.4950. Here gs is the growth rate (30%) during the 3-year supernormal growth period. Show the
$1.4950 on the time line as the cash flow at Time 1. Then calculate D2 = D1(1 + gs) = $1.4950(1.30) = $1.9435 and then D3 = D2(1 + gs)
= $1.9435(1.30) = $2.52655 (the figure shows the values rounded to 4 decimal places, but all calculations used nonrounded values).
Show these values on the time line as the cash flows at Time 2 and Time 3. Note that D0 is used only to calculate D1.
Step 2. At Time 3, the stock becomes a constant growth stock. Therefore, we can use the constant growth formula to find ^P3, which is
the PV of the dividends from Time 4 to infinity as evaluated at Time 3. First we determine D4 = $2.52655(1.08) = $2.7287 for use
in the formula, and then we calculate ^P3 as follows:
^P3 ¼
D4
rs  gL
¼
$2:7287
0:134  0:08 ¼ $50:5310
We show this $50.5310 on the time line as a second cash flow at Time 3. The $50.5310 is a Time-3 cash flow in the sense that
the owner of the stock could sell it for $50.5310 at Time 3 and also in the sense that $50.5310 is the value at Time 3 of the
dividend cash flows from Time 4 to infinity.
Step 3. Now that the cash flows have been placed on the time line, we can discount each cash flow at the required rate of return,
rs = 13.4%. This produces the PVs shown to the left below the time line, and the sum of the PVs is the value of the supernormal
growth stock, $39.21.
In the figure we show the setup for an Excel solution. With a financial calculator, you could use the cash flow (CFLO)
register of your calculator. Enter 0 for CF0 because you get no cash flow at Time 0, CF1 = 1.495, CF2 = 1.9435, and
CF3 = 2.52655 + 50.531 = 53.0576. Then enter I/YR = 13.4 and press the NPV key to find the value of the stock, $39.21.

7.9 STOCK VALUATION BY THE FREE CASH FLOW
APPROACH
The box at the beginning of the chapter showed that the value of a firm is the pres-
ent value of its future expected free cash flows (FCFs) discounted at the weighted
average cost of capital (WACC). The following example illustrates how the firm’s to-
tal value can be used to find the value of its stock.
Suppose Crum Inc. had a free cash flow of $200 million at the end of the most re-
cent year. Chapter 12 shows how to forecast financial statements and free cash flows,
but for now let’s assume that Crum’s FCFs are expected to grow at a constant rate
of 5% per year forever. Chapter 9 explains how to estimate the weighted average cost
of capital, but for now let’s assume that Crum’s WACC is 9%. The present value of
the expected future free cash flows is the PV of a growing annuity, so we can use a
variation of Equation 7-2, the value of a constantly growing stream of dividends:
V ¼ FCFð1 þ gÞ
WACC −g ¼ $200ð1:05Þ
0:09 −0:05 ¼ $5;250 million
(7-7)
FCF is the cash flow available for distribution to all of the firm’s investors, bond-
holders as well as stockholders. Also, the WACC is the average rate of return required
by all of the firm’s investors, not just shareholders. Therefore, V is the value of the entire
firm’s operations, not just the value of its equity. If the firm had any nonoperating assets,
such as short-term investments in marketable securities, then we would add them to V to
find the firm’s total value. Crum has no nonoperating assets, so its total value is $5,250
million. To find the value of its equity, subtract the value of claims held by all groups
other than common shareholders, such as debtholders and preferred stockholders. If
the value of debt plus preferred stock is $2,000 million, then Crum’s common equity
has a value of $5,250 −$2,000 = $3,250 million. If 325 million shares of stock are out-
standing, then the intrinsic value of the stock is $3,250/325 = $10 per share. This exam-
ple should give you the general idea behind the free cash flow approach to stock price
valuation, but see Chapter 13 for a more comprehensive example, including a situation
in which free cash flows are growing at a nonconstant rate.
Self-Test
Explain how to find a firm’s stock price using the free cash flow approach.
7.10 MARKET MULTIPLE ANALYSIS
If a company is publicly traded, then we can simply look up its most recent stock
price to get an estimate of the stock’s value. However, we must take another ap-
proach if the firm is privately owned. We could estimate the firm’s cost of equity
based on data for a sample of companies, forecast its earnings and dividends, and
apply the DCF method to find the value of its stock. However, another method,
market multiple analysis, can and generally would be used. Here we would take a
metric for the firm—say, its EPS—and then multiply by a market-determined multi-
ple such as the average P/E ratio for the S&P 500. This would give us an estimate of
the stock’s intrinsic value. Market multiples can also be applied to total net income,
to sales, to book value, or to number of subscribers for businesses such as cable
TV or cellular telephone systems. Whereas the discounted dividend method applies
valuation concepts in a precise manner by focusing on expected cash flows, market
multiple analysis is more judgmental.
Chapter 7: Stocks, Stock Valuation, and Stock Market Equilibrium
285

To illustrate the concept, suppose Tapley Products is a privately held firm whose
forecasted earnings per share are $7.70, and suppose the average price/earnings (P/E)
ratio for a set of similar publicly traded companies is 12. To estimate the intrinsic
value of Tapley’s stock we would simply multiply its $7.70 EPS by the multiple 12,
obtaining the value $7.70(12) = $92.40.
Another commonly used metric is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization (EBITDA). The EBITDA multiple is the total value of a company (the
market value of its equity plus that of its debt) divided by EBITDA. This multiple
is based on total value, since EBITDA is used to compensate the firm’s stockholders
and bondholders. Therefore, it is called an entity multiple. The EBITDA market
multiple is the average EBITDA multiple for a group of similar publicly traded com-
panies. This procedure gives an estimate of the company’s total value, and to find the
estimated intrinsic value of the stock we would subtract the value of the debt from
total value and then divide by the shares of stock outstanding.
As suggested previously, in some businesses, such as cable TV and cellular telephone,
a critical factor is the number of customers the company has. For example, when a tele-
phone company acquires a cellular operator, it might pay a price that is based on the num-
ber of customers. Managed care companies such as HMOs have applied similar logic in
acquisitions, basing valuations primarily on the number of people insured. Some Internet
companies have been valued by the number of “eyeballs,” which is the number of hits on
the site.
If you examine the prospectus for a firm that is having an IPO, or information
regarding the acquisition of one firm by another, you will almost certainly see refer-
ences to market multiple analysis. Security analysts also use this approach, sometimes
as a primary measure and sometimes as a supplement to a DCF analysis, when esti-
mating firms’ intrinsic values.

7.11 PREFERRED STOCK
Preferred stock is a hybrid—it’s similar to bonds in some respects and to common
stock in others. Like bonds, preferred stock has a par value, and a fixed amount of
dividends must be paid before dividends can be paid on the common stock. However,
if the preferred dividend is not earned, the directors can omit (or “pass”) it without
throwing the company into bankruptcy. So, although preferred stock has a fixed pay-
ment like bonds, a failure to make this payment will not lead to bankruptcy.
The dividends on preferred stocks are fixed, and if they are scheduled to go on
forever, the issue is a perpetuity whose value is found as follows:
Vps ¼ Dps
rps
(7-8)
Vps is the value of the preferred stock, Dps is the preferred dividend, and rps is
the required rate of return. MicroDrive has preferred stock outstanding that pays
a dividend of $10 per year. If the required rate of return on this preferred stock is
10%, then its value is $100:
Vps ¼ $10:00
0:10 ¼ $100:00
286
Part 3: Stocks and Options

If we know the current price of a preferred stock and its dividend, we can transpose
terms and solve for the expected rate of return as follows:
^rps ¼ Dps
Vps
(7-9)
Some preferred stocks have a stated maturity, say, 50 years. If a firm’s preferred
stock matures in 50 years, pays a $10 annual dividend, has a par value of $100, and
has a required return of 8%, then we can find its price using a financial calculator:
Enter N = 50, I/YR = 8, PMT = 10, and FV = 100. Then press PV to find the price,
Vps = $124.47. If you know the price of a share of preferred stock, you can solve for
I/YR to find the expected rate of return, ^rps.
Most preferred stocks pay dividends quarterly. This is true for MicroDrive, so we
could find the effective rate of return on its preferred stock as follows:
EFF% ¼ EAR ¼

If an investor wanted to compare the returns on MicroDrive’s bonds and its pre-
ferred stock, it would be best to convert the nominal rates on each security to effec-
tive rates and then compare these “equivalent annual rates.”

7.12 STOCK MARKET EQUILIBRIUM
Recall that ri, the required return on Stock i, can be found using the Capital Asset
Pricing Model (CAPM) as discussed in Chapter 6:
ri ¼ rRF þ ðRPMÞbi
If the risk-free rate of return is 8%, the market risk premium, RPM, is 4%, and Stock
i has a beta of 2, then its required rate of return is 16%:
ri ¼ 8% þ ð4%Þ2:0
¼ 16%
The marginal investor will want to buy Stock i if its expected rate of return is
more than 16%, will want to sell it if the expected rate of return is less than 16%,
and will be indifferent—and hence will hold but not buy or sell it—if the expected
rate of return is exactly 16%.
Now suppose a typical investor’s portfolio contains Stock i, and suppose she
analyzes the stock’s prospects and concludes that its earnings, dividends, and price
can be expected to grow at a constant rate of 5% per year. The last dividend was
D0 = $2.8571, so the next expected dividend is
D1¼ $2:8571ð1:05Þ¼ $3
Our investor observes that the present price of the stock, P0, is $30. Should she pur-
chase more of Stock i, sell the stock, or maintain the present position?
Chapter 7: Stocks, Stock Valuation, and Stock Market Equilibrium
287

The investor can calculate Stock i’s expected rate of return as follows:
^ri ¼ D1
P0
þ g ¼ $3
$30 þ 5% ¼ 15%
Because the expected rate of return, 15%, is less than the required return, 16%, the in-
vestor would want to sell the stock, as would most other holders if this one is typical.
However, few people would want to buy at the $30 price, so the present owners would
be unable to find buyers unless they cut the price of the stock. Thus, the price would de-
cline, and this decline would continue until the price reached $27.27, at which point the
stock would be in equilibrium, defined as the price at which the expected rate of return,
16%, is equal to the required rate of return as seen by the marginal investor:
^ri ¼
$3
$27:27 þ 5% ¼ 11% þ 5% ¼ 16% ¼ ri
Had the stock initially sold for less than $27.27, say, for $25, then events would
have been reversed. Investors would have wanted to buy the stock because its ex-
pected rate of return would have exceeded its required rate of return, and buy orders
would have driven the stock’s price up to $27.27.
To summarize, in equilibrium two related conditions must hold.
1. A stock’s expected rate of return as seen by the marginal investor must equal its
required rate of return: ^ri ¼ ri.
2. The actual market price of the stock must equal its intrinsic value as estimated by
the marginal investor: P0 ¼ ^P0.
Of course, some individual investors probably believe that ^ri > ri and ^P0 > P0, hence
they would invest in the stock, while other investors have the opposite view and
would sell all of their shares. However, it is the marginal investor who establishes
the actual market price, and for the marginal investor we must have ^ri ¼ ri and
P0 ¼ ^P0. if these conditions do not hold, trading will occur until they do.
Changes in Equilibrium Stock Prices and Market Volatility
Stock prices are not constant—as we demonstrated earlier in this chapter and else-
where, they undergo violent changes at times. Indeed, many stocks declined by 80%
or more during 2008, and a few enjoyed gains of up to 200% or even more. At the
risk of understatement, the stock market is volatile!
To see how such changes can occur, assume that Stock i is in equilibrium, selling at a
price of $27.27. If all expectations are met exactly, during the next year the price would
gradually rise by 5%, to $28.63. However, many different events could occur to cause a
change in the equilibrium price. To illustrate, consider again the set of inputs used to
develop Stock i’s price of $27.27, along with a new set of expected inputs:

Now give yourself a test: Would each of the indicated changes, by itself, lead to an
increase, a decrease, or no change in the price, and what is your guess as to the new
stock price?
Every change, taken alone, would lead to a higher price. Taken together, the first
three would lower ri from 16% to 10%:
Original ri ¼ 8% þ 4%ð2:0Þ ¼ 16%
New ri ¼ 7% þ 3%ð1:0Þ ¼ 10%
Using these values together with the new g = 6%, we find that ^P0 rises from
$27.27 to $75.71:11
Original ^P0 ¼ $2:8571ð1:05Þ
0:16 −0:05
¼ $3
0:11 ¼ $27:27
New ^P0 ¼ $2:8571ð1:06Þ
0:10 −0:06
¼ $3:0285
0:04
¼ $75:71
At the new price, the expected and required rates of return are equal:12
^ri ¼ $3:0285
$75:71 þ 6% ¼ 10% ¼ ri
This indicates that the stock is in equilibrium at the new and higher price. As
this example illustrates, even small changes in the size of expected future dividends
or in their risk, as reflected in the required return, can cause large changes in stock
prices as the price moves from one equilibrium condition to another. What might
cause investors to change their expectations about future dividends? It could be
new information about the company, such as preliminary results for an R&D pro-
gram, initial sales of a new product, or the discovery of harmful side effects from
the use of an existing product. Or new information that will affect many companies
could arrive, such as the collapse of the debt markets in 2008. Given the existence
of computers and telecommunications networks, new information hits the market
on an almost continuous basis, and it causes frequent and sometimes large changes
in stock prices. In other words, ready availability of information causes stock prices to
be volatile.
If a stock’s price is stable, this probably means that little new information is arriving.
But if you think it’s risky to invest in a volatile stock, imagine how risky it would be to
invest in a company that rarely releases new information about its sales or operations. It
may be bad to see your stock’s price jump around, but it would be a lot worse to see a
stable quoted price most of the time and then to see huge moves on the rare days when
new information is released.13 Fortunately, in our economy timely information is readily
available, and evidence suggests that stocks—especially those of large companies—adjust
11A price change of this magnitude is by no means rare. The prices of many stocks double or halve dur-
ing any given year. For example, Emergent Biosolutions went up 416% in 2008, even as the market
crashed, on the development of a new anthrax vaccine, while Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored
mortgage company, lost 98.1% of its value.
12It should be obvious by now that actual realized rates of return are not necessarily equal to expected and
required returns. Thus, an investor might have expected to receive a return of 15% if he had bought
Emergent Biosolutions stock, but after the fact, the realized return was far above 15% in 2008. On the
other hand, the 2008 actual realized return on Fannie Mae stock was far below 15%.
13Note, however, that if information came out infrequently, stock prices would probably be stable for a
time and then experience large price swings when news did come out. This would be a bit like not having
a lot of little earthquakes (frequent new information) that relieve stress along the fault and instead build-
ing up stress for a number of years before a massive earthquake.

rapidly to new information. Consequently, equilibrium ordinarily exists for any given
stock, and required and expected returns are generally equal. Stock prices certainly
change, sometimes violently and rapidly, but this simply reflects changing conditions
and expectations.
There are times, of course, when a stock appears to react for several months to
favorable or unfavorable developments. However, this does not necessarily signify a
long adjustment period; rather, it could simply indicate that, as more new pieces of
information about the situation come out, the market adjusts to them. The ability of
the market to adjust to new information is discussed in the next section.

What two conditions must hold for a stock to be in equilibrium?
Why doesn’t a volatile stock price imply irrational pricing?
7.13 THE EFFICIENT MARKETS HYPOTHESIS
A body of theory called the Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH) asserts that
(1) stocks are always in equilibrium and (2) it is impossible for an investor to “beat
the market” and consistently earn a higher rate of return than is justified by the
stock’s risk. Those who believe in the EMH note that there are 100,000 or so full-
time, highly trained, professional analysts and traders operating in the market, while
there are fewer than 3,000 major stocks. Therefore, if each analyst followed 30 stocks
(which is about right, as analysts tend to specialize in a specific industry), there would
on average be 1,000 analysts following each stock. Furthermore, these analysts work
for organizations such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, CALPERS, Prudential
Financial, and the like, which have billions of dollars available with which to take ad-
vantage of bargains. In addition, as a result of SEC disclosure requirements and elec-
tronic information networks, as new information about a stock becomes available,
these analysts generally receive and evaluate it at the same time. Therefore, the price
of a stock will adjust almost immediately to any new development. That, in a nut-
shell, is the logic behind the efficient markets hypothesis. However, there are varia-
tions on the theory, as we discuss next.
Weak-Form Efficiency
Technical analysts believe that past trends or patterns in stock prices can be used
to predict future stock prices. In contrast, those who believe in the weak form of
the EMH argue that all information contained in past price movements is fully re-
flected in current market prices. If the weak form were true, then information
about recent trends in stock prices would be of no use in selecting stocks—the
fact that a stock has risen for the past three days, for example, would give us no
useful clues as to what it will do today or tomorrow. Those who believe that
weak-form efficiency exists also believe that technical analysts, also known as
“chartists,” are wasting their time.
To illustrate the arguments, after studying the past history of the stock market, a
technical analyst might “discover” the following pattern: If a stock falls for three con-
secutive days, its price typically rises by 10% the following day. The technician
would then conclude that investors could make money by purchasing a stock whose
price has fallen three consecutive days.
Weak-form advocates argue that if this pattern truly existed then other investors
would soon discover it, and if so, why would anyone be willing to sell a stock after
it had fallen for three consecutive days? In other words, why sell if you know that
the price is going to increase by 10% the next day? Those who believe in weak-
290
Part 3: Stocks and Options

form efficiency argue that if the stock were really likely to rise to $44 tomorrow, then
its price today, right now, would actually rise to somewhere close to $44, thereby elim-
inating the trading opportunity. Consequently, weak-form efficiency implies that any
information that comes from past stock prices is rapidly incorporated into the current
stock price.
Semistrong-Form Efficiency
The semistrong form of the EMH states that current market prices reflect all
publicly available information. Therefore, if semistrong-form efficiency exists, it would
do no good to pore over annual reports or other published data because market
prices would have adjusted to any good or bad news contained in such reports back
when the news came out. With semistrong-form efficiency, investors should expect
to earn the returns predicted by the SML, but they should not expect to do any bet-
ter or worse other than by chance.
Another implication of semistrong-form efficiency is that whenever information
is released to the public, stock prices will respond only if the information is different
from what had been expected. For example, if a company announces a 30% increase
in earnings and if that increase is about what analysts had been expecting, then the
announcement should have little or no effect on the company’s stock price. On the
other hand, the stock price would probably fall if analysts had expected earnings to
increase by more than 30%, but it probably would rise if they had expected a smaller
increase.
Strong-Form Efficiency
The strong form of the EMH states that current market prices reflect all pertinent
information, whether publicly available or privately held. If this form holds, even
insiders would find it impossible to earn consistently abnormal returns in the stock
market.
Is the Stock Market Efficient?
Many empirical studies have been conducted to test the validity of the three forms of
market efficiency. Most empirical studies are joint tests of the EMH and an asset
pricing model (usually the CAPM or the Fama-French three-factor model). They
are joint tests in the sense that they examine whether a particular strategy can beat
the market, where “beating the market” means earning a return higher than that pre-
dicted by the particular asset pricing model. Most studies suggest that the stock mar-
ket is highly efficient in the weak form and reasonably efficient in the semistrong
form, at least for the larger and more widely followed stocks.14 The evidence
14The vast majority of academic studies have shown that no excess returns (defined as returns above those
predicted by the CAPM or other asset pricing models) can be earned with technical analysis—that is,
using past stock prices to predict future stock prices—especially after considering transactions costs.
A possible exception is in the area of long-term reversals, where several studies show that portfolios of
stocks with poor past long-term performance tend to do slightly better than average in the future long
term, and vice versa. Another possible exception is in the area of momentum, where studies show that
stocks with strong performance in the short-term past tend to do slightly better than average in the
short-term future, and likewise for weak performance. For example, see N. Jegadeesh and S. Titman,
“Returns to Buying Winners and Selling Losers: Implications for Stock Market Efficiency,” Journal of Fi-
nance, March 1993, pp. 69–91, and W. F. M. DeBondt and R. H. Thaler, “Does the Stock Market Over-
react?” Journal of Finance, July 1985, pp. 793–808. However, when a way to “beat” the market becomes
known, the actions of investors tend to eliminate it.
Chapter 7: Stocks, Stock Valuation, and Stock Market Equilibrium
291

suggests that the strong form EMH does not hold, because those who possessed in-
side information could and did (illegally) make abnormal profits.
However, skeptics of the EMH point to the stock market bubbles that burst in
2000 and 2008 and suggest that, at the height of these booms, the stocks of many
companies—especially in the technology sector—vastly exceeded their intrinsic
values. These skeptics suggest that investors are not simply machines that rationally
process all available information; rather, a variety of psychological and perhaps irra-
tional factors also come into play. Indeed, researchers have begun to incorporate ele-
ments of cognitive psychology in an effort to better understand how individuals and
entire markets respond to different circumstances. In other words, if people aren’t
rational in their daily decisions, why should we expect them to be rational in their
financial decisions? For example, studies show that investors tend to hold on too
long to stocks that have performed poorly in the past (i.e., losers) but that they sell
winners too quickly. This field of study is called behavioral finance.15
Keep in mind that the EMH does not assume that all investors are rational. In-
stead, it assumes that stock market prices track intrinsic values fairly closely. As we
described earlier, new information should cause a stock’s intrinsic value to move
rapidly to a new level that reflects the new information. The EMH also assumes
that if stock prices deviate from their intrinsic values, investors will quickly take ad-
vantage of this mispricing by buying undervalued stocks and selling overvalued
stocks. Thus, investors’ actions work to drive prices to their new equilibrium level
based on new information. Even if some investors behave irrationally, as by hold-
ing losers too long and/or selling winners too quickly, this does not imply that the
markets are not efficient. Thus, it is possible to have irrational investors in a ratio-
nal market.
On the other hand, if the market itself is inherently irrational (i.e., if mispricings
persist for long periods), then rational investors can lose a lot of money even if
they are ultimately proven to be correct. For example, a “rational” investor in
mid-1999 might have concluded that the Nasdaq was overvalued when it was trad-
ing at 3,000. If such an investor had acted on that assumption and sold stock short,
he would have lost a lot of money the following year, when the Nasdaq soared
to over 5,000 as “irrational exuberance” pushed the prices of already overvalued
stocks to even higher levels. Ultimately, if our “rational investor” had the courage,
patience, and financial resources to hold on, he would have been vindicated in the
long run, because the Nasdaq subsequently fell from over 5,000 to about 1,300.
But as the economist John Maynard Keynes said, “In the long run we are all
dead.”
What is the bottom line on market efficiency? Based on our reading of the evi-
dence, we believe that for most stocks, for most of the time, it is generally safe to
assume that the market is reasonably efficient in the sense that the intrinsic price is
approximately equal to the actual market price (^P0 ≈P0). However, major shifts can
and do occur periodically, causing most stocks to move strongly up or down. In the
early 1980s, inflation was running over 10% per year and interest rates on AAA
corporate bonds hit 15%. That knocked most stocks way below their intrinsic

values, so when inflation fears receded, stock prices roared ahead. A similar situa-
tion, but in reverse, may be occurring in 2008 and 2009. Stock prices have fallen
sharply, perhaps to a level below their intrinsic values. In other words, we may be
in a “reverse bubble.”
Implications of Market Efficiency for Financial Decisions
What bearing does the EMH have on financial decisions? First, many investors have
given up trying to beat the market because the professionals who manage mutual
fund portfolios, on average, do not outperform the overall stock market as measured
by an index like the S&P 500.16 Indeed, the relatively poor performance of actively
managed mutual funds helps explain the growing popularity of index funds, where
administrative costs are lower than for actively managed funds. Rather than spending
time and money trying to find undervalued stocks, index funds try instead to match
overall market returns by buying the basket of stocks that makes up a particular
index, such as the S&P 500.
Rational Behavior versus Animal Spirits, Herding, and Anchoring Bias
If investors were completely rational, they would care-
fully analyze all the available information about stocks
and then make well-informed decisions to buy, sell, or
hold them. Most academics have argued that investors
with enough clout to move the market behave in this
manner. However, the stock market bubbles of 2000
and 2008 suggest that something other than pure ratio-
nality is alive and well.
The great economist John Maynard Keynes, writing
during the 1920s and 1930s, suggested that animal spirits
influence markets. After a period of rising prosperity and
stock prices, Keynes believed that investors begin to think
that the good times will last forever, a feeling that is
driven by happy talk and high spirits rather than cool rea-
soning. Indeed, psychologists have demonstrated that
many people do in fact anchor too closely on recent
events when predicting future events, a phenomenon
called anchoring bias. Therefore, when the market is per-
forming better than average, they tend to think it will con-
tinue to perform better than average. Even worse, when
one group of investors does well, other investors begin to
emulate them, acting like a herd of sheep following one
another merrily down the road. Such herding behavior
makes it easy for hedge funds to raise enormous sums
and for con men like Bernie Madoff to find new marks.
Overinflated markets and bubbles eventually burst,
and when they do, the same psychological factors act
in reverse, often causing bigger declines than can be
explained by rational models. Eventually, though, mar-
kets bottom out, and before long the next bubble starts
to inflate. Historically, such cycles have existed for as
far back as our data go, and these cycles are inconsis-
tent with the idea of rational, data-driven investors. This
is the realm of behavioral finance as discussed earlier in
the chapter.
How can we reconcile theories that assume inves-
tors and decision makers are rational and data-driven
with the fact that businesses and the stock market are
influenced by people subject to animal spirits and herd-
ing instincts? Our conclusion is that there is some truth
in both theories—markets are rational to a large extent,
but they are also subject to irrational behavior at times.
Our advice is to do careful, rational analyses, using the
tools and techniques described in this book, but also to
recognize that actual prices can differ from intrinsic
values—sometimes by large amounts and for long per-
iods. That’s the bad news. The good news is that differ-
ences
between
actual
prices
and
intrinsic
values
provide wonderful opportunities for those able to capi-
talize on them.

Second, market efficiency also has important implications for managerial decisions,
especially stock issues, stock repurchases, and tender offers. If the market prices stocks
fairly, then managerial decisions based on the premise that a stock is undervalued or
overvalued might not make sense. Managers may have better information about their
own companies than outsiders, but it would be illegal to use this information for their
own advantage, and they cannot deliberately defraud investors by knowingly putting
out false information.

Summary
Corporate decisions should be analyzed in terms of how alternative courses of action
are likely to affect a firm’s value. However, it is necessary to know how stock prices
are established before attempting to measure how a given decision will affect a firm’s
value. This chapter showed how stock values are determined and also how investors
go about estimating the rates of return they expect to earn. The key concepts covered
are listed below.
•
A proxy is a document that gives one person the power to act for another, typi-
cally the power to vote shares of common stock. A proxy fight occurs when an
outside group solicits stockholders’ proxies in an effort to overthrow the current
management.
•
A takeover occurs when a person or group succeeds in ousting a firm’s man-
agement and takes control of the company.
•
Stockholders often have the right to purchase any additional shares sold by the
firm. This right, called the preemptive right, protects the present stockholders’
control and prevents dilution of their value.
•
Although most firms have only one type of common stock, in some instances
classified stock is used to meet the special needs of the company. One type is
founders’ shares. This is stock owned by the firm’s founders that carries sole
voting rights but restricted dividends for a specified number of years.
•
A closely held company is one whose stock is owned by a few individuals who
are typically associated with the firm’s management.
•
A publicly held company is one whose stock is owned by a relatively large
number of individuals who are not actively involved in the firm’s management.
Publicly held companies are generally regulated by the SEC or other govern-
mental bodies.
•
The intrinsic value of a share of stock is calculated as the present value of the
stream of dividends the stock is expected to provide in the future.
•
The equation used to find the intrinsic, or expected, value of a constant
growth stock is
^P0 ¼ D1
rs −g
Web Extension 7A provides a derivation of this formula.

Part 3: Stocks and Options

•
The expected total rate of return from a stock consists of an expected divi-
dend yield plus an expected capital gains yield. For a constant growth firm,
both the dividend yield and the capital gains yield are expected to remain
constant in the future.
•
The equation for ^rs, the expected rate of return on a constant growth stock, is
^rs ¼ D1
P0
þ g
•
A zero growth stock is one whose future dividends are not expected to grow
at all. A supernormal growth stock is one whose earnings and dividends are
expected to grow much faster than the economy as a whole over some specified
time period and then to grow at the “normal” rate.
•
To find the present value of a supernormal growth stock, (1) find the dividends
expected during the supernormal growth period, (2) find the price of the stock at
the end of the supernormal growth period, (3) discount the dividends and the
projected price back to the present, and (4) sum these PVs to find the current in-
trinsic, or expected, value of the stock, ^P0.
•
The horizon (terminal) date is the date when individual dividend forecasts
are no longer made because the dividend growth rate is assumed to be constant
thereafter.
•
The horizon (terminal) value is the value at the horizon date of all future divi-
dends after that date:
^PN ¼ DN þ 1
rs −g
•
Preferred stock is a hybrid security having some characteristics of debt and
some of equity.
•
The value of a share of perpetual preferred stock is found as the dividend
divided by the required rate of return:
Vps ¼ Dps
rps
•
Preferred stock that has a finite maturity is evaluated with a formula that is
identical in form to the bond value formula.
•
The marginal investor is a representative investor whose actions reflect the
beliefs of those people who are currently trading a stock. It is the marginal
investor who determines a stock’s price.
•
Equilibrium is the condition under which the expected return on a security as
seen by the marginal investor is just equal to its required return, ^rs = rs. Also, the
stock’s intrinsic value must be equal to its market price, ^P0 = P0.
•
The Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH) holds that (1) stocks are always in
equilibrium and (2) it is impossible for an investor who does not have inside
information to consistently “beat the market.” Therefore, according to the
EMH, stocks are always fairly valued (^P0 = P0) and have a required return equal
to their expected return (rs = ^rs).
•
Animal spirits refers to the tendency of investors to become excited and let their
emotions affect their behavior; herding instincts refers to the tendency of in-
vestors to follow the crowd, relying on others rather than their own analysis; and
anchoring bias is the human tendency to “anchor” too closely on recent events
when predicting future events. These three factors can interfere with our desire
to base decisions on pure rational analysis.

Two investors are evaluating General Electric’s stock for possible purchase. They
agree on the expected value of D1 and also on the expected future dividend growth
rate. Further, they agree on the risk of the stock. However, one investor normally
holds stocks for 2 years and the other normally holds stocks for 10 years. On the
basis of the type of analysis done in this chapter, they should both be willing to pay
the same price for General Electric’s stock. True or false? Explain.

A bond that pays interest forever and has no maturity date is a perpetual bond, also
called a perpetuity or a consol. In what respect is a perpetual bond similar to (1) a no-

(7–4)
In this chapter and elsewhere we have argued that a stock’s market price can deviate
from its intrinsic value. Discuss the following question: If all investors attempt to
behave in an entirely rational manner, could these differences still exist? In answering
this question, think about information that’s available to insiders versus outsiders, the
fact that historical probabilities of financial events are “fuzzier” than probabilities re-
lated to physical items, and the validity of the concepts of animal spirits, herding, and
anchoring.

plan to hold it for 3 years and then sell it.
a. Find the expected dividend for each of the next 3 years; in other words, calculate
D1, D2, and D3. Note that D0 = $2.
b. Given that the appropriate discount rate is 12% and that the first of these divi-

Reizenstein Technologies (RT) has just developed a solar panel capable of generating
200% more electricity than any solar panel currently on the market. As a result, RT is
expected to experience a 15% annual growth rate for the next 5 years. By the end of 5
years, other firms will have developed comparable technology, and RT’s growth rate will
slow to 5% per year indefinitely. Stockholders require a return of 12% on RT’s stock.
The most recent annual dividend (D0), which was paid yesterday, was $1.75 per share.
a. Calculate RT’s expected dividends for t = 1, t = 2, t = 3, t = 4, and t = 5.

ESTIMATING EXXONMOBIL’S INTRINSIC STOCK VALUE WITH
THOMSON ONE—BUSINESS SCHOOL EDITION
In this chapter we described the various factors that influence stock prices and the
approaches analysts use to estimate a stock’s intrinsic value. By comparing these in-
trinsic value estimates to the current price, an investor can assess whether it makes
sense to buy or sell a particular stock. Stocks trading at a price far below their esti-
mated intrinsic values may be good candidates for purchase, whereas stocks trading at
prices far in excess of their intrinsic value may be good stocks to avoid or sell.

Part 3: Stocks and Options

Although estimating a stock’s intrinsic value is a complex exercise that requires
reliable data and good judgment, we can use the data available in Thomson ONE
to arrive at a quick “back of the envelope” calculation of intrinsic value.
Thomson ONE—BSE Discussion Questions
1. For purposes of this exercise, let’s take a closer look at the stock of ExxonMobil
Corporation (XOM). Looking at the COMPANY OVERVIEW, we can immedi-
ately see the company’s current stock price and its performance relative to the
overall market in recent months. What is ExxonMobil’s current stock price?
How has the stock performed relative to the market over the past few months?
2. Click on the “NEWS” tab to see the recent news stories for the company. Have
there been any recent events affecting the company’s stock price, or have things
been relatively quiet?
3. To provide a starting point for gauging a company’s relative valuation, analysts
often look at a company’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Returning to the
COMPANY OVERVIEW page, you can see XOM’s current P/E ratio. To
put this number in perspective, it is useful to compare this ratio with other
companies in the same industry and to take a look at how this ratio has chan-
ged over time. If you want to see how XOM’s P/E ratio stacks up to its peers,
click on the tab labeled PEERS. Click on FINANCIALS on the next row of
tabs and then select KEY FINANCIAL RATIOS. Toward the bottom of the
table you should see information on the P/E ratio in the section titled Market
Value Ratios. Toward the top, you should see an item that says CLICK HERE
TO SELECT NEW PEER SET—do this if you want to compare XOM to a
different set of firms.
For the most part, is XOM’s P/E ratio above or below that of its peers? Off
the top of your head, can these factors explain why XOM’s P/E ratio differs from
its peers?
4. To see how XOM’s P/E ratio has varied over time, return to the COMPANY
OVERVIEW page. Next click FINANCIALS—GROWTH RATIOS and then
select WORLDSCOPE—INCOME STATEMENT RATIOS. Is XOM’s cur-
rent P/E ratio well above or well below its historical average? If so, do you
have any explanation for why the current P/E deviates from its historical trend?
On the basis of this information, does XOM’s current P/E suggest that the
stock is undervalued or overvalued? Explain.
5. In the text, we discussed using the dividend growth model to estimate a stock’s
intrinsic value. To keep things as simple as possible, let’s assume at first that
XOM’s dividend is expected to grow at some constant rate over time. Then
its intrinsic value would equal D1/(rs −g), where D1 is the expected annual div-
idend 1 year from now, rs is the stock’s required rate of return, and g is the divi-
dend’s constant growth rate. To estimate the dividend growth rate, it’s helpful first
to look at XOM’s dividend history. Staying on the current Web page (WORLD-
SCOPE—INCOME STATEMENT RATIOS), you should immediately find the
company’s annual dividend for the past several years. On the basis of this informa-
tion, what has been the average annual dividend growth rate? Another way to obtain
estimates of dividend growth rates is to look at analysts’ forecasts for future divi-
dends, which can be found on the ESTIMATES tab. Scrolling down the page, you
should see an area marked Consensus Estimates and a tab under Available Measures.
Here you click on the down arrow key and select Dividends Per Share (DPS). What
is the median year-end dividend forecast? You can use this as an estimate of D1 in
Chapter 7: Stocks, Stock Valuation, and Stock Market Equilibrium
301

your measure of intrinsic value. You can also use this forecast along with the histori-
cal data to arrive at a measure of the forecasted dividend growth rate, g.
6. The required return on equity, rs, is the final input needed to estimate intrinsic
value. For our purposes you can either assume a number (say, 8% or 9%) or
use the CAPM to calculate an estimated cost of equity using the data available
in Thomson ONE. (For more details, take a look at the Thomson ONE exer-
cise for Chapter 2). Having decided on your best estimates for D1, rs, and g,
you can then calculate XOM’s intrinsic value. How does this estimate compare
with the current stock price? Does your preliminary analysis suggest that XOM
is undervalued or overvalued? Explain.
7. Often it is useful to perform a sensitivity analysis, in which you show how your
estimate of intrinsic value varies according to different estimates of D1, rs, and
g. To do so, recalculate your intrinsic value estimate for a range of different
estimates for each of these key inputs. One convenient way to do this is to set
up a simple data table in Excel. Refer to the Excel tutorial accessed through the
textbook’s Web site for instructions on data tables. On the basis of this analysis,
what inputs justify the current stock price?
8. On the basis of the dividend history you uncovered in question 5 and your as-
sessment of XOM’s future dividend payout policies, do you think it is reason-
able to assume that the constant growth model is a good proxy for intrinsic
value? If not, how would you use the available data in Thomson ONE to esti-
mate intrinsic value using the nonconstant growth model?
9. Finally, you can also use the information in Thomson ONE to value the entire
corporation. This approach requires that you estimate XOM’s annual free cash
flows. Once you estimate the value of the entire corporation, you subtract the
value of debt and preferred stock to arrive at an estimate of the company’s eq-
uity value. Divide this number by the number of shares of common stock out-
standing, which yields an alternative estimate of the stock’s intrinsic value. This
approach may take some more time and involve more judgment concerning
forecasts of future free cash flows, but you can use the financial statements
and growth forecasts in Thomson ONE as useful starting points. Go to World-
scope’s Cash Flow Ratios Report (which you find by clicking on FINAN-
CIALS, FUNDAMENTAL RATIOS, and WORLDSCOPE RATIOS) to find
an estimate of “free cash flow per share.” Although this number is useful,
Worldscope’s definition of free cash flow subtracts out dividends per share;
therefore, to make it comparable to the measure used in this text, you must
add back dividends. To see Worldscope’s definition of free cash flow (or any
term), click on SEARCH FOR COMPANIES from the left toolbar and then
select the ADVANCED SEARCH tab. In the middle of your screen, on the
right-hand side, you will see a dialog box with terms. Use the down arrow to
scroll through the terms, highlighting the term for which you would like to see
a definition. Then, click on the DEFINITION button immediately below the
dialog box.

Part 3: Stocks and Options

of Seattle present an investment seminar to the mayors of the cities in the association, and
Strother and Tibbs, who will make the actual presentation, have asked you to help them.
To illustrate the common stock valuation process, Strother and Tibbs have asked you to
analyze the Temp Force Company, an employment agency that supplies word processor op-
erators and computer programmers to businesses with temporarily heavy workloads. You are
to answer the following questions.
a. Describe briefly the legal rights and privileges of common stockholders.
b. (1)
Write out a formula that can be used to value any stock, regardless of its dividend
pattern.
(2)
What is a constant growth stock? How are constant growth stocks valued?
(3)
What happens if a company has a constant g that exceeds its rs? Will many stocks
have expected g > rs in the short run (i.e., for the next few years)? In the long run
(i.e., forever)?
c. Assume that Temp Force has a beta coefficient of 1.2, that the risk-free rate (the yield
on T-bonds) is 7.0%, and that the market risk premium is 5%. What is the required
rate of return on the firm’s stock?
d. Assume that Temp Force is a constant growth company whose last dividend (D0, which
was paid yesterday) was $2.00 and whose dividend is expected to grow indefinitely at a
6% rate.
(1)
What is the firm’s expected dividend stream over the next 3 years?
(2)
What is the firm’s current intrinsic stock price?
(3)
What is the stock’s expected value 1 year from now?
(4)
What are the expected dividend yield, the expected capital gains yield, and the
expected total return during the first year?
e. Now assume that the stock is currently selling at $30.29. What is its expected rate of return?
f. What would the stock price be if the dividends were expected to have zero growth?
g. Now assume that Temp Force’s dividend is expected to experience supernormal growth
of 30% from Year 0 to Year 1, 20% from Year 1 to Year 2, and 10% from Year 2 to
Year 3. After Year 3, dividends will grow at a constant rate of 6%. What is the stock’s
intrinsic value under these conditions? What are the expected dividend yield and capital
gains yield during the first year? What are the expected dividend yield and capital gains
yield during the fourth year (from Year 3 to Year 4)?
h. Is the stock price based more on long-term or short-term expectations? Answer this by
finding the percentage of Temp Force’s current stock price that is based on dividends
expected more than 3 years in the future.
i. Suppose Temp Force is expected to experience zero growth during the first 3 years and then
to resume its steady-state growth of 6% in the fourth year. What is the stock’s intrinsic value
now? What is its expected dividend yield and its capital gains yield in Year 1? In Year 4?
j. Now suppose that Temp Force’s earnings and dividends are expected to decline by a
constant 6% per year forever—that is, g = −6%. Why would anyone be willing to buy
such a stock, and at what price should it sell? What would be the dividend yield and
capital gains yield in each year?
k. What is market multiple analysis?
l. Temp Force recently issued preferred stock that pays an annual dividend of $5 at a
price of $50 per share. What is the expected return to an investor who buys this pre-
ferred stock?
m. Why do stock prices change? Suppose the expected D1 is $2, the growth rate is 5%, and
rs is 10%. Using the constant growth model, what is the stock’s price? What is the impact
on the stock price if g falls to 4% or rises to 6%? If rs increases to 9% or to 11%?
n. What does market equilibrium mean?
o. If equilibrium does not exist, how will it be established?
p. What is the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, what are its three forms, and what are its
implications?
q. Assume that all the growth rates used in the preceding answers were averages of the
growth rates published by well-known and respected security analysts. Would you then
say that your results are based on a purely rational analysis? If not, what factors might
have led to “irrational results?”

exercised, then the option holders will own 16.9% of Cisco’s stock:
1.2/(5.9+1.2) = 0.169. Many of these options never may be exercised, but
any way you look at it, 1.2 billion is a lot of options. Cisco isn’t the only
company with mega-grants: Pfizer, Time Warner, Ford, and Bank of
America are among the many companies that have granted to their
employees options to buy more than 100 million shares. Whether your
next job is with a high-tech firm, a financial service company, or a
manufacturer, you will probably receive stock options, so it’s important
that you understand them.
In a typical grant, you receive options allowing you to purchase shares
of stock at a fixed price, called the strike price or exercise price, on or
before a stated expiration date. Most plans have a vesting period, during
which you can’t exercise the options. For example, suppose you are
granted 1,000 options with a strike price of $50, an expiration date 10
years from now, and a vesting period of 3 years. Even if the stock price
rises above $50 during the first 3 years, you can’t exercise the options
because of the vesting requirement. After 3 years, if you are still with the
company then you have the right to exercise the options. For example, if
the stock goes up to $110, you could pay the company $50(1,000) =
$50,000 and receive 1,000 shares of stock worth $110,000. However, if
you don’t exercise the options within 10 years, they will expire and thus be
worthless.
Even though the vesting requirement prevents you from exercising the
options the moment they are granted to you, the options clearly have some
immediate value. Therefore, if you are choosing between different job
offers where options are involved, you will need a way to determine the
value of the alternative options. This chapter explains how to value
options, so read on.

There are two fundamental approaches to valuing assets. The first is the discounted
cash flow (DCF) approach, which we covered in previous chapters: An asset’s value is
the present value of its cash flows. The second is the option pricing approach. It is im-
portant that every manager understands the basic principles of option pricing, for the
following reasons. First, many projects allow managers to make strategic or tactical
changes in plans as market conditions change. The existence of these “embedded op-
tions” often means the difference between a successful project and a failure. Under-
standing basic financial options can help you manage the value inherent in these real
options. Second, many companies use derivatives to manage risk; many derivatives
are types of financial options, so an understanding of basic financial options is neces-
sary before tackling derivatives. Third, option pricing theory provides insights into
the optimal debt/equity choice, especially when convertible securities are involved.
And fourth, understanding financial options will help you better understand any em-
ployee stock options that you receive.
8.1 OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL OPTIONS
In general, an option is a contract that gives its owner the right to buy (or sell) an
asset at some predetermined price within a specified period of time. However, there
are many types of options and option markets.1 Consider the options reported in
Table 8-1, which is an extract from a Listed Options Quotations table as it might
appear on a Web site or in a daily newspaper. The first column reports the closing
The Intrinsic Value of Stock Options
In previous chapters we showed that the intrinsic value
of an asset is the present value of its cash flows. This
time value of money approach works great for stocks
and bonds, but we must use another approach for op-
tions and derivatives. If we can find a portfolio of stocks
and risk-free bonds that replicates an option’s cash
flows, then the intrinsic value of the option must be
identical to the value of the replicating portfolio.

stock price. For example, the table shows that General Computer Corporation’s
(GCC) stock price closed at $53.50 on January 8, 2010.
A call option gives its owner the right to buy a share of stock at a fixed price,
which is called the strike price (sometimes called the exercise price because it is
the price at which you exercise the option). A put option gives its owner the right
to sell a share of stock at a fixed strike price. For example, the first row in Table 8-1
is for GCC’s options that have a $50 strike price. Observe that the table has columns
for call options and for put options with this strike price.
Each option has an expiration date, after which the option may not be exercised.
Table 8-1 reports data for options that expire in February, March, and May (the ex-
piration date is the Friday before the third Saturday of the exercise month). If the
option can be exercised any time before the expiration, then it is called an American
option; if it can be exercised only on its expiration date, it is a European option. All
of GCC’s options are American options. The first row shows that GCC has a call
option with a strike price of $50 that expires on May 14 (the third Saturday in May
2010 is the 15th). The quoted price for this option is $5.50.2
When the current stock price is greater than the strike price, the option is in-
the-money. For example, GCC’s $50 (strike) May call option is in-the-money by
$53.50 −$50 = $3.50. Thus, if the option were immediately exercised, it would
have a payoff of $3.50. On the other hand, GCC’s $55 (strike) May call is out-
of-the-money because the current $53.50 stock price is below the $55 strike price.
Obviously, you currently would not want to exercise this option by paying the $55
strike price for a share of stock selling for $53.50. Therefore, the exercise value,
which is any profit from immediately exercising an option, is3
Exercise value ¼ MAX½Current price of the stock – Strike price; 0
(8-1)
An option’s price always will be greater than (or equal to) its exercise value. If the
option’s price were less, you could buy the option and immediately exercise it, reap-
ing a sure gain. For example, GCC’s May call with a $50 strike price sells for $5.50,
which is greater than its exercise value of $3.50. Also, GCC’s out-of-the-money May
call with a strike price of $55 sells for $3.15 even though it would be worthless if it
had to be exercised immediately. An option always will be worth more than zero as

long as there is still any chance at all that it will end up in-the-money: Where there is
life, there is hope! The difference between the option’s price and its exercise value is
called the time value because it represents the extra amount over the option’s imme-
diate exercise value that a purchaser will pay for the chance the stock price will ap-
preciate over time.4 For example, GCC’s May call with a $50 strike price sells for
$5.50 and has an exercise value of $3.50, so its time value is $5.50 −$3.50 = $2.00.
Suppose you bought GCC’s $50 (strike) May call option for $5.50 and then
the stock price increased to $60. If you exercised the option by purchasing the
stock for the $50 strike price, you could immediately sell the share of stock at its
market price of $60, resulting in a payoff of $60 −$50 = $10. Notice that the stock
itself had a return of 12.1% = ($60 −$53.50)/$53.50, but the option’s return was
81.8% = ($10 −$5.50)/$5.50. Thus, the option offers the possibility of a higher return.
However, if the stock price fell to $50 and stayed there until the option expired,
the stock would have a return of −6.5% = ($50.00 −$53.50)/$53.50, but the option
would have a 100% loss (it would expire worthless). As this example shows, call op-
tions are a lot riskier than stocks. This works to your advantage if the stock price
goes up but to your disadvantage if the stock price falls.
Suppose you bought GCC’s May put option (with a strike price of $50) for $2.20
and then the stock price fell to $45. You could buy a share of stock for $45 and exer-
cise the put option, which would allow you to sell the share of stock at its strike price
of $50. Your payoff from exercising the put would be $5 = $50 −$45. Stockholders
would lose money because the stock price fell, but a put holder would make money.
In this example, your rate of return would be 127.3% = ($5 −$2.20)/$2.20. So if you
think a stock price is going to fall, you can make money by purchasing a put option.
On the other hand, if the stock price doesn’t fall below the strike price of $50 before
the put expires, you would lose 100% of your investment in the put option.5
Options are traded on a number of exchanges, with the Chicago Board Options
Exchange (CBOE) being the oldest and the largest. Existing options can be traded
in the secondary market in much the same way that existing shares of stock are
traded in secondary markets. But unlike new shares of stock that are issued by cor-
porations, new options can be “issued” by investors. This is called writing an option.
For example, you could write a call option and sell it to some other investor. You
would receive cash from the option buyer at the time you wrote the option, but you
would be obligated to sell a share of stock at the strike price if the option buyer later de-
cided to exercise the option.6 Thus, each option has two parties, the writer and the buyer,
with the CBOE (or some other exchange) acting as an intermediary. Other than commis-
sions, the writer’s profits are exactly opposite those of the buyer. An investor who writes
call options against stock held in his or her portfolio is said to be selling covered options.
Options sold without the stock to back them up are called naked options.
In addition to options on individual stocks, options are also available on several stock
indexes such as the NYSE Index and the S&P 100 Index. Index options permit one to
hedge (or bet) on a rise or fall in the general market as well as on individual stocks.
4Among traders, an option’s market price is also called its “premium.” This is particularly confusing since
for all other securities the word premium means the excess of the market price over some base price. To
avoid confusion, we will not use the word premium to refer to the option price.
5Most investors don’t actually exercise an option prior to expiration. If they want to cash in the option’s
profit or cut its losses, they sell the option to some other investor. As you will see later in the chapter,
the cash flow from selling the option before its expiration is always greater than (or equal to) the profit
from exercising the option.

Part 3: Stocks and Options

The leverage involved in option trading makes it possible for speculators with just a
few dollars to make a fortune almost overnight. Also, investors with sizable portfolios
can sell options against their stocks and earn the value of the option (less brokerage com-
missions) even if the stock’s price remains constant. Most important, though, options
can be used to create hedges that protect the value of an individual stock or portfolio.7
Conventional options are generally written for 6 months or less, but a type of op-
tion called a Long-Term Equity AnticiPation Security (LEAPS) is different. Like
conventional options, LEAPS are listed on exchanges and are available on both indi-
vidual stocks and stock indexes. The major difference is that LEAPS are long-term
options, having maturities of up to almost 3 years. One-year LEAPS cost about twice
as much as the matching 3-month option, but because of their much longer time to
expiration, LEAPS provide buyers with more potential for gains and offer better
long-term protection for a portfolio.
Corporations on whose stocks the options are written have nothing to do with the
option market. Corporations do not raise money in the option market, nor do they
have any direct transactions in it. Moreover, option holders do not vote for corporate
directors or receive dividends. There have been studies by the SEC and others as to
Financial Reporting for Employee Stock Options
When granted to executives and other employees, op-
tions are a “hybrid” form of compensation. At some com-
panies, especially small ones, option grants may be a
substitute for cash wages: employees are willing to take
lower cash salaries if they have options. Options also pro-
vide an incentive for employees to work harder. Whether
issued to motivate employees or to conserve cash, op-
tions clearly have value at the time they are granted,
and they transfer wealth from existing shareholders to
employees to the extent that they do not reduce cash ex-
penditures or increase employee productivity enough to
offset their value at the time of issue.
Companies like the fact that an option grant requires
no immediate cash expenditure, although it might di-
lute shareholder wealth if later it is exercised. Employ-
ees, and especially CEOs, like the potential wealth that
they receive when they are granted options. When op-
tion grants were relatively small, they didn’t show up
on investors’ radar screens. However, as the high-tech
sector began making mega-grants in the 1990s, and as
other industries followed suit in the heavy use of op-
tions, stockholders began to realize that large grants
were making some CEOs filthy rich at the stockholders’
expense.
Before 2005, option grants were barely visible in
companies’ financial reports. Even though such grants
are clearly a wealth transfer to employees, companies
were required only to footnote the grants and could ig-
nore them when reporting their income statements and
balance sheets. The Financial Accounting Standards
Board now requires companies to show option grants
as an expense on the income statement. To do this,
the value of the options is estimated at the time of the
grant and then expensed during the vesting period,
which is the amount of time the employee must wait
before being allowed to exercise the options. For exam-
ple, if the initial value is $100 million and the vesting
period is 2 years, the company would report a $50 mil-
lion expense for each of the next 2 years. This approach
isn’t perfect, because the grant is not a cash expense;
nor does the approach take into account changes in
the option’s value after the initial grant. However, it
does make the option grant more visible to investors,
which is a good thing.
7Insiders who trade illegally generally buy options rather than stock because the leverage inherent in op-
tions increases the profit potential. However, it is illegal to use insider information for personal gain, and
an insider using such information would be taking advantage of the option seller. Insider trading, in addi-
tion to being unfair and essentially equivalent to stealing, hurts the economy: Investors lose confidence in
the capital markets and raise their required returns because of an increased element of risk, and this raises
the cost of capital and thus reduces the level of real investment.

whether option trading stabilizes or destabilizes the stock market and whether this
activity helps or hinders corporations seeking to raise new capital. The studies have
not been conclusive, but research on the impact of option trading is ongoing.

8.2 THE SINGLE-PERIOD BINOMIAL OPTION
PRICING APPROACH
We can use a model like the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to calculate the re-
quired return on a stock and then use that required return to discount its expected fu-
ture cash flows to find its value. No such model exists for the required return on
options, so we must use a different approach to find an option’s value. In Section 8.5
we describe the Black-Scholes option pricing model, but in this section we explain the
binomial option pricing model. The idea behind this model is different from that of
the DCF model used for stock valuation. Instead of discounting cash flows at a re-
quired return to obtain a price, as we did with the stock valuation model, we will use
the option, shares of stock, and the risk-free rate to construct a portfolio whose value
we already know and then deduce the option’s price from this portfolio’s value.
The following sections describe and apply the binomial option pricing model to
Western Cellular, a manufacturer of cell phones. Call options exist that permit the
holder to buy 1 share of Western at a strike price, X, of $35. Western’s options will
expire at the end of 6 months (t is the number of years until expiration, so t = 0.5 for
Western’s options).Western’s stock price, P, is currently $40 per share. Given this
background information, we will use the binomial model to determine the call op-
tion’s value. The first step is to determine the option’s possible payoffs, as described
in the next section.
Payoffs in a Single-Period Binomial Model
In general, the time until expiration can be divided into many periods, with n denot-
ing the number of periods. But in a single-period model, which we describe in this
section, there is only one period. We assume that, at the end of the period, the
stock’s price can take on only one of two possible values, so this is called the bino-
mial approach. For this example, Western’s stock will either go up (u) by a factor of
1.25 or go down (d) by a factor of 0.80. If we were considering a riskier stock, then
we would have assumed a wider range of ending prices; we will show how to estimate
this range later in the chapter. If we let u = 1.25 and d = 0.80, then the ending stock
price will be either P(u) = $40(1.25) = $50 or P(d) = $40(0.80) = $32. Figure 8-1 illus-
trates the stock’s possible price paths and contains additional information about the
call option that is explained in what follows.
When the option expires at the end of the year, Western’s stock will sell for either
$50 or $32. As shown in Figure 8-1, if the stock goes up to $50 then the option will
have a payoff, Cu, of $15 at expiration because the option is in-the-money: $50 −$35
= $15. If the stock price goes down to $32 then the option’s payoff, Cd, will be zero
because the option is out-of-the-money.
310
Part 3: Stocks and Options

The Hedge Portfolio Approach
Suppose we created a portfolio by writing 1 call option and purchasing 1 share of
stock. As Figure 8-1 shows, if the stock price goes up then our portfolio’s stock will
be worth $50 but we will owe $15 on the option, so our portfolio’s net payoff is
$35 = $50 −$15. If the stock price goes down then our portfolio’s stock will be
worth only $32, but the amount we owe on the written option also will fall to
zero, leaving the portfolio’s net payoff at $32. The portfolio’s end-of-period price
range is smaller than if we had just owned the stock, so writing the call option re-
duces the portfolio’s price risk. Taking this further: Is it possible for us to choose
the number of shares held by our portfolio so that it will have the same net payoff
whether the stock goes up or down? If so, then our portfolio is hedged and will
have a riskless payoff when the option expires. Therefore, it is called a hedge
portfolio.
We are not really interested in investing in the hedge portfolio, but we want to
use it to help us determine the value of the option. Notice that if the hedge portfolio
has a riskless net payoff when the option expires, then we can find the present value
of this payoff by discounting it at the risk-free rate. Our current portfolio value must
equal this present value, which allows us to determine the option’s value. The follow-
ing example illustrates the steps in this approach.
1. Find Ns, the number of shares of stock in the hedge portfolio.
We want the
portfolio’s payoff to be the same whether the stock goes up or down. If we write 1 call
option and buy Ns shares of stock, then the portfolio’s stock will be worth Ns(P)(u)
should the stock price go up, so its net payoff will be Ns(P)(u) −Cu. The portfolio’s
stock will be worth Ns(P)(d) if the stock price goes down, so its net payoff will be

Ns ¼

PðuÞ −PðdÞ ¼ $15 −$0
$50 −$32 ¼ 0:83333
2. Find the hedge portfolio’s payoff.
Our next step is to find the hedge portfo-
lio’s payoff when the stock price goes up (you will get the same result if instead you
find the portfolio’s payoff when the stock goes down). Recall that the hedge portfolio
has Ns shares of stock and that we have written the call option, so the call option’s
payoff must be subtracted:
Hedge portfolio’s payoff if stock is up ¼ NsPðuÞ −Cu
¼ 0:83333ð$50Þ −$15
¼ $26:6665
Hedge portfolio’s payoff if stock is down ¼ NsPðdÞ −Cd
¼ 0:83333ð$32Þ −$0
¼ $26:6665
Figure 8-2 illustrates the payoffs of the hedge portfolio.
3. Find the present value of the hedge portfolio’s payoff.
Because the hedge
portfolio’s payoff is riskless, the current value of the hedge portfolio must be equal to
the present value of its riskless payoff. Option pricing models usually assume
continuous compounding, which we discuss in Web Extension 4C on the textbook’s
Web site, but daily compounding works well. For a 1-period model, the time to expira-
tion also is the time until the payoff occurs. In a later section we consider more than 1
period prior to expiration, so the time that we discount the payoff is equal to the time
until expiration (t) divided by the number of periods until expiration (n). In our example,
t = 0.5 and n = 1. Therefore, the present value of the hedge portfolio’s payoff is

4. Find the option’s value.
The current value of the hedge portfolio is the value
of the stock, Ns(P), less the value of the call option we wrote. Because the payoff is
riskless, the current value of the hedge portfolio must also equal the present value of
the riskless payoff:
Current value of
hedge portfolio ¼ NsP −Vc ¼ Present value of
riskless payoff
8An easy way to remember this formula is to notice that Ns is equal to the range in possible option pay-
offs divided by the range in possible stock prices.
312
Part 3: Stocks and Options

Solving for the call option’s value, we get
VC ¼ NsP −Present value of
riskless payoff
For Western’s option, this is
VC ¼ 0:83333ð$40Þ −$25:621
¼ $7:71
Hedge Portfolios and Replicating Portfolios
In our previous derivation of the call option’s value, we combined an investment in
the stock with writing a call option to create a risk-free investment. We can modify this
approach and create a portfolio that replicates the call option’s payoffs. For example,
suppose we formed a portfolio by purchasing 0.83333 shares of Western’s stock and
borrowing $25.621 at the risk-free rate (this is equivalent to selling a T-bill short).
In 6 months we would repay $25.621(1 + 0.08/365)365(0.5/1) = $26.6665. If the stock
goes up, our net payoff would be 0.83333($50) −$26.6665 = $15.00. If the stock
goes down, our net payoff would be 0.83333($32) −$26.6665 = $0. The portfolio’s
payoffs are exactly equal to the option’s payoffs as shown in Figure 8-1, so our port-
folio of 0.83333 shares of stock and the $25.621 that we borrowed would exactly
replicate the option’s payoffs. Therefore, this is called a replicating portfolio. Our
cost to create this portfolio is the cost of the stock less the amount we borrowed:
Cost of replicating portfolio = 0.83333($40) −$25.621 = $7.71

If the call option did not sell for exactly $7.71, then a clever investor could make a
sure profit. For example, suppose the option sold for $8. The investor would write an
option, which would provide $8 of cash now but would obligate the investor to pay
either $15 or $0 in 6 months when the option expires. However, the investor could
use the $8 to create the replicating portfolio, leaving the investor with $8 −$7.71 =
$0.29. In 6 months, the replicating portfolio will pay either $15 or $0. Thus, the in-
vestor isn’t exposed to any risk—the payoffs received from the replicating portfolio
exactly offset the payoffs owed on the option. The investor uses none of his
own money, has no risk, has no net future obligations, but has $0.29 in cash. This
is arbitrage, and if such an arbitrage opportunity existed then the investor would
scale it up by writing thousands of options.9
Such arbitrage opportunities don’t persist for long in a reasonably efficient econ-
omy because other investors will also see the opportunity and will try to do the same
thing. With so many investors trying to write (i.e., sell) the option, its price will fall;
with so many investors trying to purchase the stock, its price will increase. This will
continue until the option and replicating portfolio have identical prices. And because
our financial markets are really quite efficient, you would never observe the deriva-
tive security and the replicating portfolio trading for different prices—they would al-
ways have the same price and there would be no arbitrage opportunities. What this
means is that, by finding the price of a portfolio that replicates a derivative security,
we have also found the price of the derivative security itself!

PRICING FORMULA10
The hedge portfolio approach works well if you only want to find the value of one
type of option with one period until expiration. But in all other situations, the step-
by-step approach becomes tedious very quickly. The following sections describe a
formula that replaces the step-by-step approach.
9If the option sold for less than the replicating portfolio, the investor would raise cash by shorting the
portfolio and use the cash to purchase the option, again resulting in arbitrage profits.

Part 3: Stocks and Options

The Binomial Option Pricing Formula
With a little (or a lot!) of algebra, we can derive a single formula for a call option.
After programming it into Excel, which we did for this chapter’s Tool Kit, it is easy
to change inputs and determine the new value of a call option. Here is the binomial
option pricing formula:
VC ¼
Cu
ð1 þ rRF=365Þ365ðt=nÞ −d
u −d
"
#
þ Cd
u−ð1 þ rRF=365Þ365ðt=nÞ
u −d
"
#
ð1 þ rRF=365Þ365ðt=nÞ
(8-3)
We can apply this formula to Western’s call option:
VC ¼
$15 ð1 þ 0:08=365Þ365ð0:5=1Þ−0:80
1:25 −0:80
"
#
þ $0 1:25 −ð1 þ 0:08=365Þ365ð0:5=1Þ
1:25 −0:80
"
#
ð1 þ 0:08=365Þ365ð0:5=1Þ
¼ $15ð0:5351Þ þ $0ð0:2092Þ
1:040806
¼ $7:71
Notice that this is the same value that resulted from the step-by-step process shown
earlier.
The binomial option pricing formula in Equation 8-3 does not include the actual
probabilities that the stock will go up or down, nor does it include the expected stock re-
turn, which is not what one might expect. After all, the higher the stock’s expected return,
the greater the chance that the call will be in-the-money at expiration. Note, however,
that the stock’s expected return is already indirectly incorporated into the stock price.
If we want to value other Western call options or puts that expire in 6 months,
then we can again use Equation 8-3. Observe that for options with the same time
left until expiration, Cu and Cd are the only variables that depend on the option itself.
The other variables depend only on the stock process (u and d), the risk-free rate, the
time until expiration, and the number of periods until expiration. If we group these
variables together, we can then define πu and πd as
πu ¼
ð1 þ rRF=365Þ365ðt=nÞ −d
u −d
"
#
ð1 þ rRF=365Þ365ðt=nÞ
(8-4)
and
πd ¼
u −ð1 þ rRF=365Þ365ðt=nÞ
u −d
"
#
ð1 þ rRF=365Þ365ðt=nÞ
(8-5)
By substituting these values into Equation 8-3, we obtain an option pricing model
that can be applied to all of Western’s 6-month options:
VC ¼ Cuπu þ Cdπd
(8-6)
Chapter 8: Financial Options and Applications in Corporate Finance
315

In this example, πu and πd are
πu ¼
ð1 þ 0:08=365Þ365ð0:5=1Þ −0:80
1:25 −0:80
"
#
ð1 þ 0:08=365Þ365ð0:5=1Þ
¼ 0:5141
and
πd ¼
1:25 −ð1 þ 0:08=365Þ365ð0:5=1Þ
1:25 −0:80
"
#
ð1 þ 0:08=365Þ365ð0:5=1Þ
¼ 0:4466
Using Equation 8-6, the value of Western’s 6-month call option with a strike price of $35 is
Vc ¼ Cuπu þ Cdπd
¼ $15ð0:5141Þ þ $0ð0:4466Þ
¼ $7:71
Sometimes these π’s are called primitive securities because πu is the price of a simple
security that pays $1 if the stock goes up and nothing if it goes down; πu is the oppo-
site. This means that we can use these π’s to find the price of any 6-month option on
Western. For example, suppose we want to find the value of a 6-month call option
on Western but with a strike price of $30. Rather than reinvent the wheel, all we
have to do is find the payoffs of this option and use the same values of πu and πd in
Equation 8-6. If the stock goes up to $50, the option will pay $50 −$30 = $20; if the
stock falls to $32, the option will pay $32 −$30 = $2. The value of the call option is:
Value of 6-month call with $30 strike price ¼ Cuπu þ Cdπd
¼ $20ð0:5141Þ þ $2ð0:4466Þ
¼ $11:18
It is a bit tedious initially to calculate πu and πd, but once you save them it is easy
to find the value of any 6-month call or put option on the stock. In fact, you can
use these π’s to find the value of any security with payoffs that depend on Western’s
6-month stock prices, which makes them a very powerful tool.

Yegi’s Fine Phones has a current stock price of $30. You need to find the value of a
call option with a strike price of $32 that expires in 3 months. Use the binomial
model with one period until expiration. The factor for an increase in stock price is u =
1.15; the factor for a downward movement is d = 0.85. What are the possible stock
prices at expiration? ($34.50 or $25.50) What are the option’s possible payoffs at ex-
piration? ($2.50 or $0) What are πu and πd? (0.5422 and 0.4429) What is the current
value of the option (assume each month is 1/12 of a year)? ($1.36)
8.4 THE MULTI-PERIOD BINOMIAL OPTION
PRICING MODEL11
Clearly, this example is simplified. Although you could duplicate buying 0.8333 share
and writing one option by buying 8,333 shares and writing 10,000 options, the stock
price assumptions are unrealistic—Western’s stock price could be almost anything

Part 3: Stocks and Options

after 6 months, not just $50 or $32. However, if we allowed the stock to move up or
down more often, then a more realistic range of ending prices would result. In other
words, dividing the time until expiration into more periods would improve the real-
ism of the resulting prices at expiration. The key to implementing a multi-period bi-
nomial model is to keep the stock return’s annual standard deviation the same no
matter how many periods you have during a year. In fact, analysts typically begin
with an estimate of the standard deviation and use it to determine u and d. The deri-
vation is beyond the scope of a financial management textbook, but the appropriate
equations are
u ¼eσ
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
t=n
p
(8-7)
d ¼ 1
u
(8-8)
where σ is the annualized standard deviation of the stock’s return, t is the time in
years until expiration, and n is the number of periods until expiration.
The standard deviation of Western’s stock returns is 31.5573%, and application of
Equations 8-7 and 8-8 confirms the values of u and d that we used previously:
u ¼ e0:315573
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
0:5=1
p
¼ 1:25 and
d ¼
1
1:25 ¼ 0:80
Now suppose we allow stock prices to change every 3 months (which is 0.25
years). Using Equations 8-7 and 8-8, we estimate u and d to be
u ¼ e0:315573
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
0:5=2
p
¼ 1:1709 and
d ¼
1
1:1709 ¼ 0:8540
At the end of the first 3 months, Western’s price would either rise to $40(1.1709)
= $46.84 or fall to $40(0.8540) = $34.16. If the price rises in the first 3 months to
$46.84, then it would either go up to $46.84(1.1709) = $54.84 or go down to
$46.84(0.8540) = $40 at expiration. If instead the price initially falls to $40(0.8540)
= $34.16 during the first 3 months, then it would either go up to $34.16(1.1709)
= $40 or go down to $34.16(0.8540) = $29.17 by expiration. This pattern of stock
price movements is called a binomial lattice and is shown in Figure 8-3.
Because the interest rate and the volatility (as defined by u and d) are constant for
each period, we can calculate πu and πd for any period and apply these same values
for each period:12
πu ¼
ð1 þ 0:08=365Þ365ð0:5=2Þ−0:8540
1:1709 −0:8540
"
#
ð1 þ 0:08=365Þ365ð0:5=2Þ
¼ 0:51400
πd ¼
1:1709 −ð1 þ 0:08=365Þ365ð0:5=2Þ
1:1709 −0:8540
"
#
ð1 þ 0:08=365Þ365ð0:5=2Þ
¼ 0:46621
12These values were calculated in Excel, so there may be small differences due to rounding in intermedi-
ate steps.
Chapter 8: Financial Options and Applications in Corporate Finance
317

These values are shown in Figure 8-3.
The lattice shows the possible stock prices at the option’s expiration and
we know the strike price, so we can calculate the option payoffs at expiration.
Figure 8-3 also shows the option payoffs at expiration. If we focus only on the
upper right portion of the lattice shown inside the dotted lines, then it is similar to
the single-period problem we solved in Section 8.3. In fact, we can use the binomial
option pricing model from Equation 8-6 to determine the value of the option in 3
months given that the stock price increased to $46.84. As shown in Figure 8-3, the
option will be worth $12.53 in 3 months if the stock price goes up to $46.84. We can
repeat this procedure on the lower right portion of Figure 8-3 to determine the call
option’s value in 3 months if the stock price falls to $34.16; in this case, the call’s
value would be $2.57. Finally, we can use Equation 8-6 and the 3-month option
values just calculated to determine the current price of the option, which is $7.64.
Thus, we are able to find the current option price by solving three simple binomial
problems.
If we broke the year into smaller periods and allowed the stock price to move up
or down more often, then the lattice would have an even more realistic range of pos-
sible ending stock prices. Of course, estimating the current option price would re-
quire solving lots of binomial problems within the lattice, but each problem is
simple and computers can solve them rapidly. With more outcomes, the resulting

estimated option price is more accurate. For example, if we divide the year into
15 periods then the estimated price is $7.42. With 50 periods, the price is $7.39.
With 100 periods it is still $7.39, which shows that the solution converges to its final
value within a relatively small number of steps. In fact, as we break the time to expi-
ration into smaller and smaller periods, the solution for the binomial approach con-
verges to the Black-Scholes solution, which is described in the next section.
The binomial approach is widely used to value options with more complicated
payoffs than the call option in our example, such as employee stock options. This is
beyond the scope of a financial management textbook, but if you are interested in
learning more about the binomial approach then you should take a look at the text-
books by Don Chance and John Hull cited in footnote 1.

8.5 THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL
(OPM)
The Black-Scholes option pricing model (OPM), developed in 1973, helped give
rise to the rapid growth in options trading. This model, which has even been pro-
grammed into some handheld and Web-based calculators, is widely used by option
traders.
OPM Assumptions and Equations
In deriving their option pricing model, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes made the
following assumptions.
1. The stock underlying the call option provides no dividends or other distributions
during the life of the option.
2. There are no transaction costs for buying or selling either the stock or the
option.
3. The short-term, risk-free interest rate is known and is constant during the life of
the option.
4. Any purchaser of a security may borrow any fraction of the purchase price at the
short-term, risk-free interest rate.
5. Short selling is permitted, and the short seller will receive immediately the full
cash proceeds of today’s price for a security sold short.
6. The call option can be exercised only on its expiration date.
7. Trading in all securities takes place continuously, and the stock price moves
randomly.
The derivation of the Black-Scholes model rests on the same concepts as the bi-
nomial model, except time is divided into such small increments that stock prices

change continuously. The Black-Scholes model consists of the following three
equations:

p
(8-10)
d2 ¼ d1 −σ

(8-11)
The variables used in the Black-Scholes model are explained below.
The value of the option is a function of five variables: (1) P, the stock’s price;
(2) t, the option’s time to expiration; (3) X, the strike price; (4) σ, the standard
deviation of the underlying stock; and (5) rRF, the risk-free rate. We do not de-
rive the Black-Scholes model—the derivation involves some extremely compli-
cated mathematics that go far beyond the scope of this text. However, it is not
difficult to use the model. Under the assumptions set forth previously, if the op-
tion price is different from the one found by Equation 8-9, then this would pro-
vide the opportunity for arbitrage profits, which would force the option price
back to the value indicated by the model.14 As we noted earlier, the Black-
Scholes model is widely used by traders because actual option prices conform
reasonably well to values derived from the model.
VC = Current value of the call option.
P = Current price of the underlying stock.
N(di) = Probability that a deviation less than di will occur in a standard normal
distribution. Thus, N(d1) and N(d2) represent areas under a standard
normal distribution function.
X = Strike price of the option.
e ≈2.7183.
rRF = Risk-free interest rate.13
t = Time until the option expires (the option period).
ln(P/X) = Natural logarithm of P/X.
σ = Standard deviation of the rate of return on the stock.

13The risk-free rate should be expressed as a continuously compounded rate. If r is a continuously com-
pounded rate, then the effective annual yield is er −1.0. An 8% continuously compounded rate of return
yields e0.08 −1 = 8.33%. In all of the Black-Scholes option pricing model examples, we will assume that
the rate is expressed as a continuously compounded rate.
14Programmed trading, in which stocks are bought and options are sold (or vice versa), is an example of
arbitrage between stocks and options.

Part 3: Stocks and Options

Application of the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model
The current stock price (P), the exercise price (X), and the time to maturity (t)
can all be obtained from a newspaper, such as The Wall Street Journal, or from
the Internet, such as the CBOE’s Web site. The risk-free rate (rRF) is the yield
on a Treasury bill with a maturity equal to the option expiration date. The annu-
alized standard deviation of stock returns (σ) can be estimated from daily stock
prices. First, find the stock return for each trading day for a sample period, such
as each trading day of the past year. Second, estimate the variance of the daily
stock returns. Third, multiply this estimated daily variance by the number of trad-
ing days in a year, which is approximately 250.15 Take the square root of the
annualized variance, and the result is an estimate of the annualized standard
deviation.
We will use the Black-Scholes model to estimate Western’s call option that we
discussed previously. Here are the inputs:
P ¼ $40
X ¼ $35
t ¼ 6 months ð0:5 yearsÞ
rRF ¼ 8:0% ¼ 0:080
σ ¼ 31:557% ¼ 0:31557
Given this information, we first estimate d1 and d2 from Equations 8-10 and 8-11:
d1 ¼ lnð$40=$35Þ þ ½0:08 þ ðð0:315572Þ=2Þð0:5Þ

Note that N(d1) and N(d2) represent areas under a standard normal distribution
function. The easiest way to calculate this value is with Excel. For example, we
can use the function =NORMSDIST(0.8892), which returns a value of N(d1) =

for all calculations.
15If stocks traded every single day of the year, then each daily stock return would cover a period of
24 hours. Suppose you take a sample of these 24-hour returns and estimate the variance. There are 365
24-hour periods in a year, so you should multiply the 24-hour variance by 365 to estimate the annual var-
iance. However, stocks don’t trade every day because of weekends and holidays. If you excluded weekends
from your sample (i.e., if you discarded the returns from the close of trading on Friday to the close of
trading on Monday), then each return would be for a 24-hour period. So you should multiply your esti-
mated 24-hour variance by 365 to estimate the annual variance.
If instead you measure returns from the close of one trading day until the close of the next trading
day, then some returns are for 24 hours (such as Thursday close to Friday close) and some are for longer
periods, like the 72-hour return from Friday close to Monday close. On average, though, five sequential
returns cover one week. With roughly 50 weeks of trading in the year (assuming that about 14 weekdays
have no trading because of holidays), each of the returns measured from trading day to trading day covers
about 1/250 = 1/(5 × 50) year. So if you include returns over weekends and holidays in your sample, you
should multiply the variance of daily (i.e., trading-day-to-trading-day) returns by 250 to convert it to an
annual variance.
You could use trading-day-to-trading-day returns and adjust them for the length of each period
(24 hours, 48, hours, etc.), but most analysts just multiply the variance by 250. Also, some analysts esti-
mate the daily return as ln(Pt/Pt-1) instead of estimating the daily return as the percentage change in stock
prices.
Chapter 8: Financial Options and Applications in Corporate Finance
321

N(0.8892) = 0.8131. Similarly, the NORMSDIST function returns a value of N(d2)
= 0.7473.16 We can use those values to solve Equation 8-9:
VC ¼ $40½Nð0:8892Þ −$35e−ð0:08Þð0:5Þ½Nð0:6661Þ
¼ $7:39
Thus, the value of the option is $7.39. This is the same value we found using the
binomial approach with 100 periods in the year.
The Five Factors That Affect Option Prices
The Black-Scholes model has five inputs, so there are five factors that affect option
prices. Figure 8-4 shows how three of Western Cellular’s call options are affected
by Western’s stock price (all three options have a strike price of $35). The three
options expire in 1 year, in 6 months (0.5 years, like the option in our example),
and in 3 months (or 0.25 years), respectively.
Figure 8-4 offers several insights regarding option valuation. Notice that for all stock
prices, the option prices are always above the exercise value. If this were not true, then an
investor could purchase the option and immediately exercise it for a quick profit.
When the stock price falls far below the strike price, the option prices fall toward
zero. In other words, options lose value as they become more and more out-
of-the-money. When the stock price greatly exceeds the strike price, the option
prices fall toward the exercise value. Thus, for very high stock prices, options tend
to move up and down by about the same amount as does the stock price.

0.3133 = 0.8133, so N(0.8892) lies between 0.8106 and 0.8133. You could interpolate to find a closer
value, but we suggest using Excel instead.

Part 3: Stocks and Options

Option prices increase if the stock price increases. This is because the strike price
is fixed, so an increase in stock price increases the chance that the option will be in-
the-money at expiration. Although we don’t show it in the figure, an increase in the
strike price would obviously cause a decrease in the option’s value because higher
strike prices mean a lower chance of being in-the-money at expiration.
The 1-year option always has a greater value than the 6-month option, which al-
ways has a greater value than the 3-month option; thus, the longer an option has un-
til expiration, the greater its value. This is because stock prices move up on average,
so a longer time until expiration means a greater chance for the option to be in-
the-money by its expiration date, making the option more valuable.
Shown in the following table are the Black-Scholes model prices for Western’s call
option with the original inputs except for standard deviation, which is allowed to vary.

The first row shows the option price if there is very little stock volatility.17 Notice
that as volatility increases, so does the option price. Therefore, the riskier the under-
lying security, the more valuable the option. To see why this makes sense, suppose
you bought a call option with a strike price equal to the current stock price. If the
stock had no risk (which means σ = 0), then there would be a zero probability of
the stock going up, hence a zero probability of making money on the option. On
the other hand, if you bought an option on a high-variance stock, there would be a
higher probability that the stock would go way up and hence that you would make a
large profit on the option. Of course, a high-variance stock could go way down, but
as an option holder your losses would be limited to the price paid for the option—
only the right-hand side of the stock’s probability distribution counts. Put another
way, an increase in the price of the stock helps option holders more than a decrease
hurts them, so the greater the stock’s volatility, the greater the value of the option.
This makes options on risky stocks more valuable than those on safer, low-risk
stocks. For example, an option on Cisco should have a greater value than an other-
wise identical option on Kroger, the grocery store chain.
Shown below are the prices for Western’s call option with the original inputs ex-
cept for the risk-free rate, which is allowed to vary.

17With such a low standard deviation, the current stock price of $40 is unlikely to change very much be-
fore expiration, so the option will be in-the-money at expiration and the owner will certainly pay the
strike price and exercise the option at that time. This means that the present value of the strike price is
the cost of exercising expressed in today’s dollars. The present value of a stock’s expected cash flows is
equal to the current stock price. So the value of the option today is approximately equal to the current
stock price of $40 less the present value of the strike price that must be paid when the stock is exercised
at expiration. If we assume daily compounding, then the current option price should be:

As the risk-free rate increases, the value of the option increases. The principal effect
of an increase in rRF is to reduce the present value of the exercise price, which in-
creases the current value of the option. Option prices in general are not very sensi-
tive to interest rate changes, at least not to changes within the ranges normally
encountered.
Myron Scholes and Robert Merton (who also was a pioneer in the field of options)
were awarded the 1997 Nobel Prize in Economics, and Fischer Black would have
been a co-recipient had he still been living. Their work provided analytical tools
and methodologies that are widely used to solve many types of financial problems,
not just option pricing. Indeed, the entire field of modern risk management is based
primarily on their contributions. Although the Black-Scholes model was derived for a
European option that can be exercised only on its maturity date, it also applies to
Taxes and Stock Options
If an employee stock option grant meets certain condi-
tions, it is called a “tax-qualifying grant” or sometimes
an “Incentive Stock Option"; otherwise, it is a “non-
qualifying grant.” For example, suppose you receive
a grant of 1,000 options with an exercise price of $50.
If the stock price goes to $110 and you exercise the
options, you must pay $50(1,000) = $50,000 for stock
that is worth $110,000, which is a sweet deal. But
what is your tax liability? If you receive a nonqualify-
ing grant, then you are liable for ordinary income
taxes on 1,000($110 −$50) = $60,000 when you exer-
cise the option. But if it is a tax-qualified grant, you
owe no regular taxes when exercised. By waiting
at least a year and then selling the stock for, say,
$150, you would have a long-term capital gain of
1,000($150 −$50) = $100,000, which would be taxed
at the lower capital gains rate.
Before you gloat over your newfound wealth, you
had better consult your accountant. Your “profit”
when you exercise the tax-qualified options isn’t tax-
able under the regular tax code, but it is under the Al-
ternative Minimum Tax (AMT) code. With an AMT tax
rate of up to 28%, you might owe as much as
0.28($110 −$50)(1,000) = $16,800. Here’s where people
get into trouble. The AMT tax isn’t due until the follow-
ing April, so you might think about waiting until then to
sell some stock to pay your AMT tax (so that the sale
will qualify as a long-term capital gain).
But what happens if the stock price falls to $5 by
next April? You can sell your stock, which raises only
$5(1,000) = $5,000 in cash. Without going into the de-
tails, you will have a long-term capital loss of 1,000
($50 −$5) = $45,000 but IRS regulations limit your net
capital loss in a single year to $3,000. In other words,
the cash from the sale and the tax benefit from the cap-
ital loss aren’t nearly enough to cover the AMT tax. You
may be able to reduce your taxes in future years be-
cause of the AMT tax you pay this year and the carry-
forward of the remaining long-term capital loss, but
that doesn’t help right now. You lost $45,000 of your
original $50,000 investment, you now have very little
cash, and—adding insult to injury—the IRS will insist
that you also pay the $16,800 AMT tax.
This is exactly what happened to many people who
made paper fortunes in the dot-com boom only to see
them evaporate in the ensuing bust. They were left with
worthless stock but multimillion-dollar AMT tax obligations.
In fact, many still have IRS liens garnishing their wages until
they eventually pay their AMT tax. So if you receive stock
options, we congratulate you. But unless you want to be the
next poster child for poor financial planning, we advise you
to settle your AMT tax when you incur it.

What is the purpose of the Black-Scholes option pricing model?
Explain what a “riskless hedge” is and how the riskless hedge concept is used in the
Black-Scholes OPM.
Describe the effect of a change in each of the following factors on the value of a call
option: (1) stock price, (2) exercise price, (3) option life, (4) risk-free rate, and (5) stock
return standard deviation (i.e., risk of stock).
Using an Excel worksheet, what is the value of a call option with these data: P = $35,
X = $25, rRF = 6%, t = 0.5 (6 months), and σ = 0.6? ($12.05)
8.6 THE VALUATION OF PUT OPTIONS
A put option gives its owner the right to sell a share of stock. If the stock pays no divi-
dends and the option can be exercised only upon its expiration date, what is its value?
Rather than reinventing the wheel, consider the payoffs for two portfolios at expiration
date T, as shown in Table 8-2. The first portfolio consists of a put option and a share
of stock; the second has a call option (with the same strike price and expiration date as
the put option) and some cash. The amount of cash is equal to the present value of
the exercise cost discounted at the continuously compounded risk-free rate, which is
Xe–rRFt. At expiration, the value of this cash will equal the exercise cost, X.
If PT, the stock price at expiration date T, is less than X, the strike price when the
option expires, then the value of the put option at expiration is X −PT. Therefore,
the value of Portfolio 1, which contains the put and the stock, is equal to X minus PT
plus PT, or just X. For Portfolio 2, the value of the call is zero at expiration (because
the call option is out-of-the-money), and the value of the cash is X, for a total value
of X. Notice that both portfolios have the same payoffs if the stock price is less than
the strike price.
What if the stock price is greater than the strike price at expiration? In this case,
the put is worth nothing, so the payoff of Portfolio 1 is equal to PT, the stock price at
expiration. The call option is worth PT −X, and the cash is worth X, so the payoff of
Portfolio 2 is PT. Hence the payoffs of the two portfolios are equal regardless of
whether the stock price is below or above the strike price.
If the two portfolios have identical payoffs, then they must have identical values.
This is known as the put–call parity relationship:

Put option + Stock = Call option + PV of exercise price.
If Vc is the Black-Scholes value of the call option, then the value of a put is18
Put option ¼ VC −P þ Xe−rRFt
(8-12)
For example, consider a put option written on the stock discussed in the previous
section. If the put option has the same exercise price and expiration date as the call,
then its price is
Put option ¼ $7:39 −$40 þ $35e−0:08ð0:5Þ
¼ $7:39 −$40 þ $33:63 ¼ $1:02
It is also possible to modify the Black-Scholes call option formula to obtain a put
option formula:
Put option ¼ P½Nðd1Þ −1 −Xe−rRFt½Nðd2Þ −1
(8-13)
The only difference between this formula for puts and the formula for calls is the
subtraction of 1 from N(d1) and N(d2) in the call option formula.

In words, what is put–call parity?
A put option written on the stock of Taylor Enterprises (TE) has an exercise price of
$25 and 6 months remaining until expiration. The risk-free rate is 6%. A call option
written on TE has the same exercise price and expiration date as the put option.
TE’s stock price is $35. If the call option has a price of $12.05, then what is the price
(i.e., value) of the put option? ($1.31)
8.7 APPLICATIONS OF OPTION PRICING IN
CORPORATE FINANCE
Option pricing is used in four major areas of corporate finance: (1) real options anal-
ysis for project evaluation and strategic decisions, (2) risk management, (3) capital
structure decisions, and (4) compensation plans.
Real Options
Suppose a company has a 1-year proprietary license to develop a software application
for use in a new generation of wireless cellular telephones. Hiring programmers and
marketing consultants to complete the project will cost $30 million. The good news
is that if consumers love the new cell phones, there will be a tremendous demand for
the software. The bad news is that if sales of the new cell phones are low, the soft-
ware project will be a disaster. Should the company spend the $30 million and de-
velop the software?
Because the company has a license, it has the option of waiting for a year, at which
time it might have a much better insight into market demand for the new cell
phones. If demand is high in a year, then the company can spend the $30 million
and develop the software. If demand is low, it can avoid losing the $30 million devel-
18This model cannot be applied to an American put option or to a European option on a stock that pays
a dividend prior to expiration. For an explanation of valuation approaches in these situations, see the
books by Chance and Hull cited in footnote 1.
326
Part 3: Stocks and Options

opment cost by simply letting the license expire. Notice that the license is analogous
to a call option: It gives the company the right to buy something (in this case, soft-
ware for the new cell phones) at a fixed price ($30 million) at any time during the
next year. The license gives the company a real option, because the underlying asset
(the software) is a real asset and not a financial asset.
There are many other types of real options, including the option to increase ca-
pacity at a plant, to expand into new geographical regions, to introduce new pro-
ducts, to switch inputs (such as gas versus oil), to switch outputs (such as producing
sedans versus SUVs), and to abandon a project. Many companies now evaluate real
options with techniques that are similar to those described earlier in the chapter for
pricing financial options.
Risk Management
Suppose a company plans to issue $400 million of bonds in 6 months to pay for a
new plant now under construction. The plant will be profitable if interest rates re-
main at current levels, but if rates rise then it will be unprofitable. To hedge against
rising rates, the company could purchase a put option on Treasury bonds. If interest
rates go up then the company would “lose” because its bonds would carry a high in-
terest rate, but it would have an offsetting gain on its put options. Conversely, if rates
fall then the company would “win” when it issues its own low-rate bonds, but it
would lose on the put options. By purchasing puts, the company has hedged the
risk due to possible interest rate changes that it would otherwise face.
Another example of risk management is a firm that bids on a foreign contract. For
example, suppose a winning bid means that the firm will receive a payment of 12 million
euros in 9 months. At a current exchange rate of $1.57 per euro, the project would be
profitable. But if the exchange rate falls to $1.10 per euro, the project would be a loser.
To avoid exchange rate risk, the firm could take a short position in a forward contract
that allows it to convert 12 million euros into dollars at a fixed rate of $1.50 per euro in
9 months, which would still ensure a profitable project. This eliminates exchange rate
risk if the firm wins the contract, but what if the firm loses the contract? It would still
be obligated to sell 12 million euros at a price of $1.50 per euro, which could be a disas-
ter. For example, if the exchange rate rises to $1.75 per euro, then the firm would have
to spend $21 million to purchase 12 million euros at a price of $1.75/€ and then sell the
euros for $18 million = ($1.50/€)(€12 million), a loss of $3 million.
To eliminate this risk, the firm could instead purchase a currency put option that
allows it to sell 12 million euros in 9 months at a fixed price of $1.50 per euro. If the
company wins the bid, it will exercise the put option and sell the 12 million euros for
$1.50 per euro if the exchange rate has declined. If the exchange rate hasn’t declined,
then it will sell the euros on the open market for more than $1.50 and let the option
expire. On the other hand, if the firm loses the bid, then it has no reason to sell euros
and could let the option contract expire. Note, however, that even if the firm doesn’t
win the contract, it still is gambling on the exchange rate because it owns the put; if
the price of euros declines below $1.50, the firm will still make some money on the
option. Thus, the company can lock in the future exchange rate if it wins the bid and
can avoid any net payment at all if it loses the bid. The total cost in either scenario is
equal to the initial cost of the option. In other words, the cost of the option is like
insurance that guarantees the exchange rate if the company wins the bid and guaran-
tees no net obligations if it loses the bid.
Many other applications of risk management involve futures contracts and other
complex derivatives rather than calls and puts. However, the principles used in
Chapter 8: Financial Options and Applications in Corporate Finance
327

pricing derivatives are similar to those used earlier in this chapter for pricing options.
Thus, financial options and their valuation techniques play key roles in risk
management.
Capital Structure Decisions
Decisions regarding the mix of debt and equity used to finance operations are quite im-
portant. One interesting aspect of the capital structure decision is based on option pric-
ing. For example, consider a firm with debt requiring a final principal payment of $60
million in 1 year. If the company’s value 1 year from now is $61 million, then it can
pay off the debt and have $1 million left for stockholders. If the firm’s value is less than
$60 million, then it may well file for bankruptcy and turn over its assets to creditors, re-
sulting in stockholders’ equity of zero. In other words, the value of the stockholders’
equity is analogous to a call option: The equity holders have the right to buy the assets
for $60 million (which is the face value of the debt) in 1 year (when the debt matures).
Suppose the firm’s owner-managers are considering two projects. One project has
very little risk, and it will result in an asset value of either $59 million or $61 million.
The other has high risk, and it will result in an asset value of either $20 million or
$100 million. Notice that the equity will be worth zero if the assets are worth less
than $60 million, so the stockholders will be no worse off if the assets end up at
$20 million than if they end up at $59 million. On the other hand, the stockholders
would benefit much more if the assets were worth $100 million than $61 million.
Thus, the owner-managers have an incentive to choose risky projects, which is con-
sistent with an option’s value rising with the risk of the underlying asset. Potential
lenders recognize this situation, so they build covenants into loan agreements that re-
strict managers from making excessively risky investments.
Not only does option pricing theory help explain why managers might want to
choose risky projects (consider, for example, the case of Enron) and why debtholders
might want restrictive covenants, but options also play a direct role in capital struc-
ture choices. For example, a firm could choose to issue convertible debt, which gives
bondholders the option to convert their debt into stock if the value of the company
turns out to be higher than expected. In exchange for this option, bondholders
charge a lower interest rate than for nonconvertible debt. Because owner-managers
must share the wealth with convertible-bond holders, they have a smaller incentive
to gamble with high-risk projects.
Compensation Plans
Many companies use stock options as a part of their compensation plans. It is impor-
tant for boards of directors to understand the value of these options before they grant
them to employees. We discuss compensation issues associated with stock options in
more detail in Chapter 13.
Self-Test
Describe four ways that option pricing is used in corporate finance.
Summary
In this chapter we discussed option pricing topics, which included the following.
•
Financial options are instruments that (1) are created by exchanges rather than
firms, (2) are bought and sold primarily by investors, and (3) are of importance to
both investors and financial managers.
328
Part 3: Stocks and Options

•
The two primary types of financial options are (1) call options, which give the
holder the right to purchase a specified asset at a given price (the exercise, or
strike, price) for a given period of time, and (2) put options, which give the
holder the right to sell an asset at a given price for a given period of time.
•
A call option’s exercise value is defined as the maximum of zero or the current
price of the stock less the strike price.
•
The Black-Scholes option pricing model (OPM) or the binomial model can
be used to estimate the value of a call option.
•
The five inputs to the Black-Scholes model are (1) P, the current stock price;
(2) X, the strike price; (3) rRF, the risk-free interest rate; (4) t, the remaining time
until expiration; and (5) σ, the standard deviation of the stock’s rate of return.
•
A call option’s value increases if P increases, X decreases, rRF increases,
t increases, or σ increases.
•
The put–call parity relationship states that
Put option + Stock = Call option + PV of exercise price.

consistently ranked either at or close to the top of the list. Although GE’s
stock has fallen sharply in recent times, like that of most other companies, it was
still in eighth place in the March 2009 survey.
GE is the most diversified company in the world. It originally manufactured
electric generating equipment and light bulbs. Then it branched into appliances
and industrial equipment such as jet engines and locomotives, then into
infrastructure, various industrial services, movies, TV, and loans to individuals and
businesses. People tend to think of GE as an industrial company, but by far its
largest unit is GE Capital, its finance unit. This reliance on GE Capital, combined
with uncertainty about potential losses on its huge loan portfolio, was primarily
responsible for GE’s poor stock price performance in 2008–2009.
A key factor in GE’s long-run success has been its financial discipline: the
company is reported to have set a uniform “hurdle rate” for potential new
investments and then accepted projects if and only if their expected returns
exceed that hurdle rate. Historically, the same hurdle rate was used for all
projects—apparently the company did not systematically vary the rate to reflect
individual
projects’
perceived
risks.
Project
managers
were
charged
with
achieving the rate of return they had forecasted, and careers rose or fell
depending on whether or not they “made their numbers.”
With 20-20 hindsight, we can see that there was a flaw in GE’s logic. The
economy enjoyed a strong upward trend from 1945 to 2007, so defaults on
mortgages, corporate debt, credit cards, and other debt instruments were
relatively low. Moreover, until 2009 GE was one of only six nonfinancial
companies with a AAA bond rating, which enabled it to borrow at extremely low
rates and then re-lend the money at much higher rates. In that environment, it
was easy for GE Capital to forecast returns that exceeded the corporate hurdle
rate, and that led to the unit’s rapid growth. GE’s other units had fewer projects
that exceeded the corporate hurdle rate; hence, GE Capital’s share of total
corporate revenues, profits, and especially debt increased rapidly.
Recently, though, as the economy sank into a recession and the housing
market collapsed, investors became worried about all lenders’ loans. They started
dumping financial stocks—including GE’s, which led to its huge stock price
decline. If GE’s management had looked more closely at the potential effects of
GE Capital’s increased use of debt to finance the purchase of risky mortgages
and other debt, and if it had used risk-adjusted hurdle rates rather than a uniform
rate, then some of its pain might have been avoided.

Businesses require capital to develop new products, build factories and distribution
centers, install information technology, expand internationally, and acquire other
companies. For each of these actions, a company must estimate the total investment
required and then decide whether the expected rate of return exceeds the cost of the
capital. The cost of capital is also a factor in compensation plans, with bonuses depen-
dent on whether the company’s return on invested capital exceeds the cost of that cap-
ital. This cost is also a key factor in choosing the firm’s mixture of debt and equity and
in decisions to lease rather than buy assets. As these examples illustrate, the cost of cap-
ital is a critical element in many business decisions.1
Corporate Valuation and the Cost of Capital
In Chapter 1, we told you that managers should strive
to make their firms more valuable and that the value
of a firm is determined by the size, timing, and risk
of its free cash flows (FCF). Indeed, a firm’s intrinsic
value is found as the present value of its FCFs,
discounted at the weighted average cost of capital
(WACC).
In
previous
chapters,
we
examined
the
major
sources
of
financing
(stocks,
bonds,
and
preferred stock) and the costs of those instruments.
In this chapter, we put those pieces together and esti-
mate the WACC that is used to determine intrinsic
value.

1The cost of capital is also an important factor in the regulation of electric, gas, and water companies.
These utilities are natural monopolies in the sense that one firm can supply service at a lower cost than
could two or more firms. Because it has a monopoly, an unregulated electric or water company could
exploit its customers. Therefore, regulators (1) determine the cost of the capital investors have provided
the utility and then (2) set rates designed to permit the company to earn its cost of capital, no more and
no less.

9.1 THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL
If a firm’s only investors were common stockholders, then its cost of capital
would be the required rate of return on its equity. However, most firms employ
different types of capital, and because of their differences in risk, the different se-
curities have different required rates of return. The required rate of return on
each capital component is called its component cost, and the cost of capital
used to analyze capital budgeting decisions is found as a weighted average of the
various components’ costs. We call this weighted average just that, the weighted
average cost of capital, or WACC.
National Computer Corporation (NCC) is a mid-sized manufacturer of main-
frame computers. We will estimate NCC’s cost of capital in this chapter. We
begin by providing some basic information in Figure 9-1, including: (1) balance
sheets; (2) percentages of total liabilities and equity comprised by each item
(Column F); (3) percentages of financing in the form of “costly” capital supplied
by investors, including banks, bondholders, and stockholders (Column H reports
percentages based on book values from the financial statements); (4) percentages
of investor-supplied capital based on current market values (Column I); and
(5) target capital structure weights that management plans to use when raising
new capital in the future (Column L). Following is a brief discussion of this
information.
Notice that we exclude accounts payable and accruals in Columns G to L.
Capital is provided by investors—interest-bearing debt, preferred stock, and com-
mon equity. Accounts payable and accruals arise from operating decisions, not
from financing decisions. For example, payables and accruals increase automati-
cally when sales increase, so the impact of payables and accruals is incorporated
into a firm’s free cash flows and a project’s cash flows rather than into the cost
of capital. Therefore, we consider only investor-supplied capital when we calcu-
late the cost of capital.
Notice that Figure 9-1 (in Columns H, J, and L) reports percentages of financing
based on book values, market values, and target weights. We examine the choice of
target weights in more detail in Chapter 15, where we discuss the optimal capital
structure: one in which the percentages of debt, preferred stock, and common equity
maximize the firm’s value. As shown in the last column of Figure 9-1, NCC has con-
cluded that it should use 30% debt, 10% preferred stock, and 60% common equity
in its target capital structure, and it plans to raise capital in those proportions in the
future. Therefore, we use those target weights when calculating NCC’s weighted av-
erage cost of capital.2

2We should also note that the weights could be based on either the book or market values of the capital
components. The market value of the equity is found by multiplying the stock’s price by the number of
shares outstanding. Market value weights are theoretically superior. However, accountants show assets on
a book value basis, bond rating agencies and security analysts generally focus on book values, and market
value weights are quite unstable because stock prices fluctuate so much. If a firm’s book and market values
differ widely, then often it appears as though management sets target weights as a blend of book and mar-
ket weights. We discuss this more in Chapter 15, but for now just accept the target weights provided in
this chapter as determined by management.

9.2 BASIC DEFINITIONS
Now we define the key terms used in this chapter. Later we describe how to estimate
the values of these variables and how to combine them to form the weighted average
cost of capital, but an early overview is useful.

Notes:
1.
The market value of the notes payable is equal to the book value. Some of NCC’s long-term bonds sell at
a discount and some sell at a premium, but their aggregate market value is approximately equal to their
aggregate book value.
2.
The common stock price is $32 per share. There are 325 million shares outstanding, for a total market cap of
$32(325) = $10,400 million.
3.
The preferred stock price is $100 per share. There are 12 million shares outstanding, for a total market value
of $100(12) = $1,200 million.
4.
When establishing the target capital structure, no distinction is made between common equity raised by
issuing stock versus retaining earnings.
5.
The firm assumes that it will eventually replace most notes payable with long-term bonds and that the
costs of notes payable and long-term debt are approximately the same; hence it simply uses a 30%
weight for all investor-supplied debt (i.e., for the combined notes payable and long-term debt).
6.
Accounts payable and accruals are not sources of investor-supplied capital, so we exclude them when
calculating the WACC. However, we include the effects of payables and accruals on free cash flow and on a
project’s cash flows, so we do not ignore payables and accruals when estimating the value of a company or
project. See Chapter 16 for more discussion of payables in the context of working capital management.
7.
When deciding on a target capital structure, managers consider the firm’s current and recent past book and
market value structures as well as those of benchmark firms. They also perform stress tests by forecasting
financial statements under different assumptions regarding capital structures and different states of the
economy. See Chapter 15 for more on setting the target capital structure weights.

In the following sections we explain how to estimate the various components’ costs.
Self-Test
Identify the firm’s three major capital structure components and give the symbols
for their respective costs and weights.
What are the two possible components of new common equity (and hence two
possible costs of common equity)? Which one is normally relevant, and why is
this so?
rd = Interest rate on the firm’s new debt = before-tax component cost of
debt. It can be found in several ways, including calculating the yield
to maturity on the firm’s currently outstanding bonds.
rd(1 −T) = After-tax component cost of debt, where T is the firm’s marginal tax
rate. rd(1 −T) is the debt cost used to calculate the weighted average cost of
capital. As we shall see, the after-tax cost of debt is lower than its
before-tax cost because interest is tax deductible.
rps = Component cost of preferred stock, found as the yield investors expect
to earn on the preferred stock. Preferred dividends are not tax
deductible, so the before-tax and after-tax costs of preferred are equal.
rs = Component cost of common equity raised by retaining earnings, or
internal equity. It is the rs developed in Chapter 7, where it is defined
as the rate of return that investors require on a firm’s common
stock. Most firms, once they have become well established, obtain all
of their new equity as retained earnings.
re = component cost of external equity, or common equity raised by
issuing new stock. As we will see, re is equal to rs plus a factor that
reflects the cost of issuing new stock. Note, though, that established
firms like NCC rarely issue new stock; hence re is rarely a relevant
consideration except for very young, rapidly growing firms.
w = wd, wps, ws, we = target weights of debt, preferred stock, internal
equity (retained earnings) and external equity (new issues of
common stock). The weights are the percentages of the different
types of capital the firm plans to use when it raises capital in the
future. Target weights may differ from actual current weights.
WACC = the firm’s weighted average, or overall, cost of capital.
3We assume at this point that all new common equity is raised internally by retaining earnings, as is true
for most companies with moderate or slow sales growth, so the cost of common equity is rs.
Chapter 9: The Cost of Capital
339

9.3 COST OF DEBT, rd(1−T)
The first step in estimating the cost of debt is to determine the rate of return debt-
holders require, or rd. Although estimating rd is conceptually straightforward, some
problems arise in practice. Companies use both fixed- and floating-rate debt, both
straight and convertible debt, both long- and short-term debt, as well as debt with
and without sinking funds. Each type of debt may have a somewhat different cost.
It is unlikely that the financial manager will know at the beginning of a planning period
the exact types and amounts of debt that will be used during the period. The type or types
used will depend on the specific assets to be financed and on capital market conditions as
they develop over time. Even so, the financial manager does know what types of debt are
typical for his firm. For example, NCC typically issues commercial paper to raise short-
term money to finance working capital, and it issues 30-year bonds to raise long-term debt
used to help finance its capital budgeting projects. Since the WACC is used primarily in
capital budgeting, NCC’s treasurer uses the cost of 30-year bonds in her WACC estimate.
Assume that it is January 2011 and that NCC’s treasurer is estimating the WACC for
the coming year. How should she calculate the component cost of debt? Most financial
managers begin by discussing current and prospective interest rates with their invest-
ment bankers. Assume NCC’s bankers believe that a new, 30-year, noncallable, straight
bond issue would require a 9% coupon rate with semiannual payments. It can be offered
to the public at its $1,000 par value. Therefore, their estimate of rd is 9%.4
Note that 9% is the cost of new, or marginal, debt, and it will probably not be
the same as the average rate on NCC’s previously issued debt, which is called the
historical, or embedded, rate. The embedded cost is important for some decisions
but not for others. For example, the average cost of all the capital raised in the past
and still outstanding is used by regulators when they determine the rate of return
that a public utility should be allowed to earn. However, in financial management
the WACC is used primarily to make investment decisions, and these decisions hinge
on projects’ expected future returns versus the cost of the new, or marginal, capital
that will be used to finance those projects. Thus, for our purposes, the relevant cost is
the marginal cost of new debt to be raised during the planning period.
Suppose NCC has issued debt in the past and the bonds are publicly traded. The
financial staff can use the market price of the bonds to find the yield to maturity (or
yield to call, if the bonds sell at a premium and are likely to be called). This yield is
the rate of return that current bondholders expect to receive, and it is also a good
estimate of rd, the rate of return that new bondholders will require.
For example, suppose NCC has outstanding bonds with an 8% annual coupon rate,
22 years remaining until maturity, and a face value of $1,000. The bonds make semian-
nual coupon payments and currently are trading in the market at a price of $904.91. We
can find the yield to maturity by using a financial calculator with these inputs: N = 44,
PV = −904.91, PMT = 40, and FV = 1000. Solving for the rate, we find I/YR = 4.5%.
This is a semiannual periodic rate, so the nominal annual rate is 9.0%. This is consistent
with the investment bankers’ estimated rate, so 9% is a reasonable estimate for rd. If
NCC had no publicly traded debt, then its staff could still look at the yields on publicly
traded debt of similar firms for a reasonable estimate of rd.
The required return to debtholders, rd, is not equal to the company’s cost of debt be-
cause interest payments are deductible, which means the government in effect pays part
of the total cost. As a result, the weighted average cost of capital is calculated using the
4The effective annual rate is (1 + 0.09/2)2 −1 = 9.2%, but NCC and most other companies use nominal
rates for all component costs.

after-tax cost of debt, rd(1 −T ), which is the interest rate on debt, rd, less the tax sav-
ings that result because interest is deductible. Here T is the firm’s marginal tax rate.5

tax cost of debt is 5.4%:6

¼ 9%ð0:6Þ
¼ 5:4%
Flotation Costs and the Cost of Debt
Most debt offerings have very low flotation costs, especially for privately placed debt.
Because flotation costs are usually low, most analysts ignore them when estimating
the after-tax cost of debt. However, the following example illustrates the procedure
for incorporating flotation costs as well as their impact on the after-tax cost of debt.
Suppose NCC can issue 30-year debt with an annual coupon rate of 9%, with
coupons paid semiannually. The flotation costs, F, are equal to 1% of the value of the
issue. Instead of finding the pre-tax yield based upon pre-tax cash flows and then ad-
justing it to reflect taxes, as we did before, we can find the after-tax, flotation-adjusted
cost by using this formula:
Mð1 −FÞ ¼∑
N
t¼1
INTð1 −TÞ
½1 þ rdð1 −TÞt þ
M
½1 þ rdð1 −TÞN
(9-3)
Here M is the bond’s maturity (or par) value, F is the percentage flotation cost (i.e.,
the percentage of proceeds paid to the investment bankers), N is the number of pay-
ments, T is the firm’s tax rate, INT is the dollars of interest per period, and rd(1 −T)
is the after-tax cost of debt adjusted for flotation costs. With a financial calculator, en-
ter N = 60, PV = −1000(1 −0.01) = −990, PMT = 45(1 −0.40) = 33, and FV = 1000.
Solving for I/YR, we find I/YR = rd(1 −T) = 2.73%, which is the semiannual after-tax
component cost of debt. The nominal after-tax cost of debt is 5.46%. Note that this
is quite close to the original 5.40% after-tax cost, so in this instance adjusting for
flotation costs doesn’t make much difference.7
5The federal tax rate for most corporations is 35%. However, most corporations are also subject to state
income taxes, so the marginal tax rate on most corporate income is about 40%. For illustrative purposes,
we assume that the effective federal-plus-state tax rate on marginal income is 40%. The effective tax rate
is zero for a firm with such large current or past losses that it does not pay taxes. In this situation, the
after-tax cost of debt is equal to the pre-tax interest rate.
6Strictly speaking, the after-tax cost of debt should reflect the expected cost of debt. Although NCC’s
bonds have a promised return of 9%, there is some chance of default and so its bondholders’ expected re-
turn (and consequently NCC’s cost) is a bit less than 9%. However, for a relatively strong company such
as NCC, this difference is quite small.
7Equation 9-3 produces the correct after-tax cost of debt only for bonds issued at par. For bonds with a price
other than par, the after-tax cash flows must be adjusted to take into account the actual taxation of the discount
or premium. See Web Extension 5A on the textbook’s Web site for a discussion of the taxation of original issue
discount bonds. Also, we ignored the tax shield due to amortization of flotation costs because it has very little
effect on the cost of debt; see Ch09 Tool Kit.xls for an example that incorporates the amortization tax shield.
Chapter 9: The Cost of Capital
341

However, the flotation adjustment would be higher if F were larger or if the
bond’s life were shorter. For example, if F were 10% rather than 1%, then the nomi-
nal annual flotation-adjusted rd(1 −T) would be 6.13%. With N at 1 year rather than
30 years and F still equal to 1%, the nominal annual rd(1 −T) = 6.45%. Finally, if
F = 10% and N = 1, then the nominal annual rd(1 −T) = 16.67%. In all of these
cases, the effect of flotation costs would be too large to ignore.
As an alternative to adjusting the cost of debt for flotation costs, in some situations
it makes sense to instead adjust the project’s cash flows. For example, project financ-
ing is a special situation in which a large project, such as an oil refinery, is financed
with debt plus other securities that have a specific claim on the project’s cash flows.
This is different from the usual debt offering, in which the debt has a claim on all of
the corporation’s cash flows. Because project financing is funded by securities with
claims tied to a particular project, the flotation costs can be included with the proj-
ect’s other cash flows when evaluating the project’s value. However, project financing
is relatively rare, so when we incorporate the impact of flotation costs, we usually do
so by adjusting the component cost of the new debt.
The Cost of Short-Term Debt
As we mentioned earlier, most U.S. companies use short-term debt primarily to finance
seasonal working capital needs. Seasonal debt fluctuates during the year, often dropping
close to zero, so it is not a permanent source of financing for most U.S. companies. There-
fore, we usually do not include short-term debt when estimating the cost of capital.
However, some U.S. companies and many international companies, especially
those in Japan, do use relatively large amounts of short-term debt on a consistent ba-
sis. For such companies, we should include short-term debt as a capital component
when estimating the WACC. Most short-term debt is in the form of bank loans, of-
ten with an interest rate that is tied to the prime rate or to the London Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR). The interest rate on short-term debt is its pre-tax cost, and
it must be adjusted to determine its after-tax cost. Also, there are normally no flota-
tion costs for short-term debt, so flotation adjustments are not required.
Self-Test
Why is the after-tax cost of debt, rather than its before-tax cost, used to calculate
the weighted average cost of capital?
Is the relevant cost of debt when calculating the WACC the interest rate on already
outstanding debt or the rate on new debt? Why?
A company has outstanding long-term bonds with a face value of $1,000, a 10% cou-
pon rate, 25 years remaining until maturity, and a current market value of $1,214.82. If
it pays interest semiannually, then what is the nominal annual pre-tax cost of debt?
(8%) If the company’s tax rate is 40%, what is the after-tax cost of debt? (4.8%)
9.4 COST OF PREFERRED STOCK, rps
Many firms (including NCC) use, or plan to use, preferred stock as part of their fi-
nancing mix. Preferred dividends are not tax deductible, so the company bears their
full cost. Therefore, no tax adjustment is used when calculating the cost of preferred stock.
Some preferred stocks are issued without a stated maturity date, but today most have
a sinking fund that effectively limits their life. Finally, although it is not mandatory
that preferred dividends be paid, firms generally have every intention of doing so,
because otherwise (1) they cannot pay dividends on their common stock, (2) they
will find it difficult to raise additional funds in the capital markets, and (3) in some
cases preferred stockholders can take control of the firm.
342
Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

The component cost of preferred stock, rps, is the cost used in the WACC cal-
culation. For preferred stock with a stated maturity date, we use the same approach
as in the previous section for the cost of debt, keeping in mind that a firm has no tax
savings with preferred stock. For preferred stock without a stated maturity date, rps is
Component cost of preferred stock ¼ rps ¼
Dps
Ppsð1 −FÞ
(9-4)
Here Dps is the preferred dividend, Pps is the preferred stock price, and F is the flo-
tation cost as a percentage of proceeds.
To illustrate the calculation, assume NCC has preferred stock that pays an $8 div-
idend per share and sells for $100 per share. If NCC issued new shares of preferred
then it would incur an underwriting (or flotation) cost of 2.5%, or $2.50 per share, so
it would net $97.50 per share. Therefore, NCC’s cost of preferred stock is 8.2%:
rps ¼ $8=$97:50 ¼ 8:2%
If we had not incorporated flotation costs, we would have incorrectly estimated
rps = $8/$100 = 8.0%, which is too big a difference to ignore. Therefore, analysts
usually include flotation costs when estimating the firm’s cost of preferred stock.
Although preferred stock is riskier than debt, NCC’s preferred stock has a lower
return to investors than does its debt: 8% versus 9%. However, recall that most pre-
ferred stock is held by other companies, which are allowed to exclude 70% of
GE and Warren Buffett: The Cost of Preferred Stock
In October 2008, GE was in serious trouble. Its stock
price had been crashing, its sales and earnings were
declining, it was having trouble rolling over its commer-
cial paper, and there were rumors that its bonds were
about to be downgraded, which would raise its interest
expense and exacerbate all its other problems. Then
Warren Buffett came to the rescue. Buffett agreed to
buy $3 billion of a new GE preferred stock, and he pub-
licly expressed his confidence by asserting that “GE will
continue to be successful in the years to come.” GE
needed a boost, and Buffett’s money and endorsement
provided it.
However, Buffett didn’t exactly give GE something
for nothing. The preferred stock carried a 10% coupon,
it had a 10% call premium, and it was convertible into
GE’s common stock during the next 5 years at a rate of
4.4944 shares of common per share of preferred. GE in-
curred no flotation costs because the deal was worked
out between the two parties rather than being sold by
underwriters. GE had been financing with commercial
paper (until that market dried up) at an after-tax cost
of about 2%, and its AAA-rated bonds were yielding
about 8%, for an after-tax cost of about 4.8% because
interest is tax-deductible. So the 10% coupon cost of
Buffett’s preferred stock was not cheap.
Buffett actually expected to earn more than 10% on
the deal. We don’t know what he assumed the stock
would do over the next 5 years, but he might have ex-
pected it to grow at a rate of 13.3% per year, which
would move the stock from its then-current price of
$24.50 to $45.74. Given that growth rate, Buffett could
earn a tidy 23.3% on his investment by converting to
common stock at the end of Year 5. Even if the stock
appreciated at only 6% he would still earn 16.78% per
year, and if the stock actually declined then he would
still earn 10%—provided GE didn’t go bankrupt. (The
rate of return on the convertible preferred stock is cal-
culated in a Tab in Ch09 Tool Kit.xls.)
Buffett’s return is the mirror image of GE’s cost. Be-
cause GE had been doing most of its financing with
commercial paper and long-term debt at much lower
rates, using convertible preferred instead was a real

preferred stocks’ dividends from taxation. Thus, the after-tax return to these inves-
tors is higher for preferred stock than for debt, which is consistent with preferred
stock being riskier than debt.
Self-Test
Does the component cost of preferred stock include or exclude flotation costs?
Explain.
Why is no tax adjustment made to the cost of preferred stock?
A company’s preferred stock currently trades for $50 per share and pays a $3 annual
dividend. Flotation costs are equal to 3% of the gross proceeds. If the company is-
sues preferred stock, what is the cost of that stock? (6.19%)
9.5 COST OF COMMON STOCK, rs
Companies can raise common equity in two ways: (1) by selling newly issued shares
to the public, and (2) by retaining and reinvesting earnings. If new shares are issued,
what rate of return must the company earn to satisfy the new stockholders? In previ-
ous chapters we have seen that investors require a return of rs. However, a company
must earn more than rs on new external equity to provide this rate of return to in-
vestors, because there are flotation costs when a firm issues new equity.
Few firms with moderate or slow growth issue new shares of common stock
through public offerings.8 In fact, less than 2% of all new corporate funds come
from the external public equity market. There are three reasons for this.
1. As we noted earlier, flotation costs can be quite high.
2. Investors perceive the issuance of common stock as a negative signal about the true
value of the company’s stock. Investors believe that managers have superior knowl-
edge about companies’ future prospects and that managers are most likely to issue
new stock when they think the current stock price is above its intrinsic value. Sup-
pose a company has an extremely profitable new project but will have to finance it
with external capital. If the firm finances the project with common stock, the new
stockholders will share in the windfall when the new project’s profits start rolling in.
Therefore, it is logical to think that managers will want to finance really good new
projects with debt, temporarily increasing the debt ratio but planning to sell stock
when profits rise and pull up the stock price. On the other hand, if things look bad,
management might want to finance with stock to let new shareholders share in the
pain. The net result is that if a mature company announces plans to issue additional
shares, investors typically take this as a signal of bad news; as a result, the stock
declines.
3. Even without the signaling effect, an increase in the supply of stock will put
pressure on the stock’s price, forcing the company to sell the new stock at a lower
price than existed before the new issue was announced.
In the remainder of this section, we assume that the company does not plan to issue
new shares.9 We will address the impact of flotation costs on the cost of equity in
Section 9.10.
Does new equity capital raised by reinvesting earnings have a cost? The answer
is a resounding “yes!” If earnings are reinvested, then stockholders will incur an
8A few companies issue new shares through new-stock dividend reinvestment plans, which we discuss in
Chapter 14. Many companies sell stock to their employees, and companies occasionally issue stock to
finance huge projects or mergers. Also, some utilities regularly issue common stock.
9There are times when companies should issue stock in spite of these problems; hence, we discuss stock
issues and the cost of equity later in the chapter.

opportunity cost—the earnings could have been paid out as dividends or used to
repurchase stock, and in either case stockholders would have received funds that
they could reinvest in other securities. Thus, the firm should earn on its reinvested earn-
ings at least as much as its stockholders themselves could earn on alternative investments of
equivalent risk.
What rate of return could stockholders expect to earn on equivalent-risk invest-
ments? The answer is rs, because they could presumably earn that return by simply
buying the stock of the firm in question or that of a similar firm. Therefore, rs is the
cost of common equity raised internally as reinvested earnings. If a company can’t earn at
least rs on reinvested earnings, then it should pass those earnings on to its stock-
holders and let them invest the money themselves in assets that do yield rs.
Whereas debt and preferred stock are contractual obligations that have easily de-
termined costs, it is more difficult to estimate rs. However, we can employ the prin-
ciples described in Chapters 6 and 7 to produce reasonably good estimates for
the cost of equity. Three methods are typically used: (1) the Capital Asset Pricing
Model (CAPM), (2) the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, and (3) the over-
own-bond-yield-plus-judgmental-risk-premium approach. These methods are not
mutually exclusive: When estimating a company’s cost of equity, we generally use
all three methods and then use an average, weighted on the basis of our confidence
in the data used for each method.

What are the two primary sources of equity capital?
Why do most established firms not issue additional shares of common equity?
Explain why there is a cost to using reinvested earnings; that is, why aren’t rein-
vested earnings a free source of capital?
9.6 THE CAPM APPROACH
To estimate the cost of common stock using the Capital Asset Pricing Model as dis-
cussed in Chapter 6, we proceed as follows.
1. Estimate the risk-free rate, rRF.
2. Estimate the current market risk premium, RPM, which is the required market
return minus the risk-free rate.
3. Estimate the stock’s beta coefficient, bi, which measures the stock’s relative risk.
The subscript i signifies Stock i’s beta.
4. Use these three values in Equation 9-5 to estimate the stock’s required rate of
return:
rs ¼ rRF þ ðRPMÞbi
(9-5)
Equation 9-5 shows that the CAPM estimate of rs begins with the risk-free rate, rRF.
We then add a risk premium that is equal to the risk premium on the market, RPM,
scaled up or down to reflect the particular stock’s risk as measured by its beta coeffi-
cient. The following sections explain how to implement this four-step process.
Estimating the Risk-Free Rate
The starting point for the CAPM cost-of-equity estimate is rRF, the risk-free rate.
There is no such thing as a truly riskless asset in the U.S. economy. Treasury securi-
ties are essentially free of default risk; however, nonindexed long-term T-bonds will
suffer capital losses if interest rates rise, indexed long-term bonds will decline if the
Chapter 9: The Cost of Capital
345

real rate rises, and a portfolio of short-term T-bills will provide a volatile earnings
stream because the rate earned on T-bills varies over time.
Since we cannot, in practice, find a truly riskless rate upon which to base the
CAPM, what rate should we use? A survey of highly regarded companies shows that
about two-thirds of them use the rate on 10-year Treasury bonds.10 We agree with
their choice, and here are our reasons.
1. Common stocks are long-term securities and—although a particular stockholder
may not have a long investment horizon—most stockholders do invest on a
relatively long-term basis. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that stock returns
embody relatively long-term inflation expectations similar to those reflected in
bonds rather than the short-term expectations in bills.
2. Short-term Treasury bill rates are more volatile than are long-term Treasury
bond rates and, most experts agree, are more volatile than rs.11
3. In theory, the CAPM is supposed to measure the required return over a particu-
lar holding period. When it is used to estimate the cost of equity for a project,
the theoretically correct holding period is the life of the project. Since a time
period of 10 years is a reasonable average for projects’ lives, the return on a
10-year T-bond is a logical choice for the risk-free rate.
T-bond rates can be found in The Wall Street Journal, the Federal Reserve Bulletin,
or on the Internet. Although most analysts use the yield on a 10-year T-bond as a
proxy for the risk-free rate, yields on 20- or 30-year T-bonds are also reasonable
proxies.
Estimating the Market Risk Premium
Recall from Chapter 6 that the market risk premium, RPM, is the required return on
the stock market minus the risk-free rate, where the risk-free rate usually is defined
as the yield on a 10-year Treasury bond. This is also called the equity risk pre-
mium, or just the equity premium. Since most investors are risk averse, they require
a higher anticipated return (a risk premium) to induce them to invest in risky equities
versus a Treasury bond. Unfortunately, the required return on the market, and hence
the equity premium, is not directly observable. Three approaches may be used to es-
timate the market risk premium: (1) calculate historical premiums and use them to
estimate the current premium; (2) use the current value of the market to estimate
forward-looking premiums; and (3) survey experts. We proceed with an explanation
of each approach.
Historical Risk Premium.
Historical risk premium data for U.S. securities, up-
dated annually, are available from many sources, including Ibbotson Associates.12
Using data from 1926 through the most recent year, Ibbotson calculates the actual
realized rate of return each year for the stock market and for long-term government
bonds. Ibbotson defines the annual equity risk premium as the difference between

the historical realized returns on stocks and the historical returns on long-term
T-bonds.13 Ibbotson’s 2009 book reported a 6.5% arithmetic average historical risk
premium and a 4.4% geometric average. If investor risk aversion had actually been
constant during the sample period, then the arithmetic average would be the best es-
timate for next year’s risk premium, whereas the geometric average would be the best
estimate for the longer-term risk premium, say, for the next 20 years.
There are several problems with using historical averages to estimate the current
risk premium. First, stock returns are quite volatile, which leads to low confidence in
estimated averages. For example, the estimated historical average premium is 6.5%,
but the 95% confidence interval ranges from about 1.6% to 11.4%. In other words,
there is a very good chance that the true risk premium is much different from the
calculated 6.5% average.
Second, the historical average is extremely sensitive to the period over which it is cal-
culated. Just 9 years ago the historical average premium was 8.1%, which is substantially
different from the current 6.5% average. In fact, over the past 12 years the average
T-bond return has been higher than the average stock return, resulting in a negative his-
torical premium. However, the expected premium can’t be negative—no one would in-
vest in the stock market expecting to get a return that is less than the risk-free rate.
Third, changes in the risk premium can occur if investors’ tolerance for risk
changes. This causes problems in interpreting historical returns because a change in
the required risk premium causes an opposite change in the observed premium. For ex-
ample, an increase in the required premium means that investors have become more
risk averse and require a higher return on stocks. But applying a higher discount rate
to a stock’s future cash flows causes a decline in stock price. Thus, an increase in the
required premium causes a simultaneous decrease in the observed premium. Part of
the market’s precipitous decline in 2008 surely was due to investors’ increased risk
aversion.
Forward-Looking Risk Premiums.
An alternative to the historical risk premium
is the forward-looking, or ex ante, risk premium. Again, the market risk premium is
RPM = rM −rRF, but rM and rRF are measured using forward-looking rather than his-
torical data. As explained previously, we can use the yield to maturity on a 10-year
T-bond as an estimate of the risk-free rate, which was 2.94% when we wrote this in
May 2009. The challenge is to estimate the required return on the market, rM. The
most common approach is to assume that the market is in equilibrium, in which case
the required return is equal to the expected return: rM ¼^rM. We can use the dis-
counted cash flow (DCF) model from Chapter 7 to estimate the expected market
rate of return, ^rM. If we assume that the market dividend will grow at a constant
rate and that the firms that make up the market pay out as dividends all the funds
available for distribution (i.e., the firms make no stock repurchases or purchases of
short-term investments), then the required return is:
Required
rate of return ¼ rM ¼
Expected
rate of return ¼ ^rM ¼ D1
P0
þ g
(9-6)
Thus, the required return on the market can be estimated as the sum of the market’s
expected dividend yield plus the expected constant growth rate in dividends.
13The risk premium should be defined using the yield on T-bonds, so Ibbotson actually uses the return
on T-bonds due to coupons rather than the total bond return (which includes capital gains and apprecia-
tion) as a proxy for the yield.

It is easy to obtain the market’s actual dividend yield; in May 2009, Reuters.com
reported a dividend yield of 2.93% for the S&P 500. It is a little more difficult, but
not impossible, to find an estimate of the expected dividend yield. In April 2009,
Standard & Poor’s reported a projected dividend yield of 2.8% for the S&P 500.
We have an estimate of the expected dividend yield to use in Equation 9-6, but
where can we get an estimate of the constant dividend growth rate, g? There is no
definitive answer to that question, but neither are we totally in the dark. In the long
run, constant dividend growth is driven by constant earnings growth, which in turn is
driven by constant sales growth; hence it is reasonable to use an estimate of the mar-
ket’s long-term growth rate of sales as a proxy for the dividend growth rate.
Sales revenue growth is determined by growth in prices and units sold. In the long
run, price growth will follow inflation. Historically, the average inflation rate has been
about 3%. We can get a forward estimate of inflation by subtracting the real interest
rate from the yield on a 10-year T-bond. The yield of an inflation-protected Treasury
bond (called a TIPS) is a good estimate of the real interest rate. In May 2009, the yield
on a 10-year TIPS was 1.69%, so a forward estimate of inflation is 2.94% −1.69% =
1.25%.14 This suggests that a reasonable estimate of expected inflation is somewhere be-
tween 1.25% and the historical average of 3%. In the long run, quantity growth will be
driven by population growth. What is a reasonable estimate of sustainable population
growth? There is no definitive answer, but somewhere around 1% to 2.5% is reason-
able. Combining long-term population growth with expected inflation suggests that the
long-term constant growth rate in sales is around 2.25% to 5.5%.15
Using a mid-point of our inflation and population growth estimates, a reasonable
estimate of g is about 3.88%. When we combine this with the market’s projected div-
idend yield, our estimate of the expected market risk return is
rM ¼^rM ¼ D1
P0
þ g
¼ 2:82% þ 3:88%
¼ 6:70%
Given the 10-year T-bond yield of 2.94%, the estimated forward-looking market
risk premium is therefore
RPM ¼ rM −rRF
¼ 6:70% −2:94%
¼ 3:76%
This probably underestimates the market risk premium because it relies on two
unrealistic assumptions: (1) firms will not repurchase any stock and (2) growth in di-
vidends will be constant. Let’s examine each of these assumptions and see how to in-
corporate them into the forward-looking approach.

14The difference in the yield on a T-bond and a TIPS of the same maturity actually includes a risk pre-
mium for bearing inflation risk as well as the anticipated inflation, but we assume that anticipated inflation
makes up most of the difference.
15Our estimates might be a little low because they ignore potential innovation and sustainable productiv-
ity growth. Will innovation create net increases in the quantity sold as new products hit the market, or
will new products simply replace old products, resulting in no net increase in quantity sold? Real productiv-
ity (measured as per capita GDP) in the United States has grown at an average annual rate of about 1.5% to
2.5%. Will this continue, or will the law of diminishing returns cause productivity eventually to level off? If
you are optimistic about the positive prospects of innovation and productivity, then you might want to add
about 1% to our estimates of long-term sales growth. Keep in mind, though, that there’s a reason econom-
ics is called “the dismal science”!

Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

In recent years, companies in the S&P 500 have distributed roughly as much cash
to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases as in dividends.16 We define Rep/
Div as the dollars used to repurchase stock divided by the dollars paid out in divi-
dends and define Rep1 as the expected repurchases at Year 1. In this notation, the
total dollars paid out in dividends and repurchases will be (1 + Rep/Div)(Div).
When stocks are repurchased each year, the number of outstanding shares declines
each year, so the long-term growth rate in dividends per share (DPS) no longer is
equal to the growth rate in sales. Let g be the long-term growth rate in total payouts
(which should be the same as the long-term growth rate in sales and earnings) and let
gDPS be the long-term growth in DPS. The expected market return is given by
rM ¼^rM ¼ ð1 þ Rep=DivÞ D1
P0
þ g
¼ D1
P0
þ Rep1
P0
þ g
¼ D1
P0
þ gDPS
(9-7)
where the actual growth rate in dividends per share, gDPS, is the sum of the repur-
chase yield (Rep1/P0) and the long-term growth rate in sales. All three versions of
Equation 9-7 are equivalent, but we usually work with the first line because it’s easier
to obtain the necessary inputs.
If we assume that companies will, in aggregate, distribute about as many dollars via
repurchases as via cash dividends in the future as they have in the recent past, then
Rep/Div ≈1. Using our previous estimates of the dividend yield and the long-term
growth rate, the expected market return and risk premium are
rM ¼^rM ¼ ð1 þ Rep=DivÞ D1
P0
þ g
¼ ð1 þ 1Þð2:82%Þ þ 3:88% ¼ 9:52%;
RPM ¼ rM −rRF ¼ 9:52% −2:94% ¼ 6:98%
As these equations show, it is fairly easy to incorporate the impact of stock re-
purchases into our estimated market risk premium. We can also incorporate noncon-
stant payouts. We do this in Web Extension 9A and in the tab Web 9A in Ch09 Tool
Kit.xls. Allowing for nonconstant growth and stock repurchases, we estimate that the
required market return is about 8.97%. This would imply a market risk premium of
RPM ¼ rM −rRF ¼ 8:97% −2:94% ¼ 6:03%
Although this is our best estimate of the market risk premium as of April 2009, the
forward-looking approach has some potential problems. First, analysts (and profes-
sors!) have a hard time accurately predicting sales, earnings, and payouts for more
than a few quarters into the future. Second, the accuracy (and truthfulness) of ana-
lysts who work for investment banking firms has been questioned in recent years.
This suggests it might be better to use the forecasts of independent analysts, such as
those who work for publications like Value Line, rather than those who work for the
large investment banking firms who sell stocks for a living. Third, different analysts
16For example, see the analysis by Douglas J. Skinner, “The Evolving Relation between Earnings, Divi-
dends, and Stock Repurchases,” Journal of Financial Economics, Vol. 87, 2008, pp. 582–609. We discuss

have different estimates for growth, and we don’t know which estimate, if any, truly
represents the views of the marginal investor.
Surveys of Experts.
What do the experts think about the market risk premium?
Two professors at Duke University, John Graham and Campbell Harvey (now work-
ing in conjunction with CFO magazine), have surveyed CFOs quarterly beginning in
2000.17 One survey question asks CFOs what they expect the S&P 500 return to be
over the next year. Their answers over the past 8 years have implied an average ex-
pected risk premium of 3.46%. It is interesting that, in the most recent survey
(March 2009), CFOs expect the S&P 500 to have a 2.18% return—this is less than
the 10-year T-bond rate, which implies a negative market risk premium.
According to recent surveys of professors, the expected market risk premium is
around 5.0% to 6.5%, with most professors in 2007 and 2008 indicating that they
believe the risk premium has fallen somewhat since 2000.18
To muddy the water a bit further, some academics have recently argued for a
much lower market risk premium. Professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French ex-
amined earnings and dividend growth rates during the period from 1951 to 2000 and
estimated the forward-looking market risk premium to be 2.55%. Similarly, Profes-
sor Jay Ritter from the University of Florida argues that the forward-looking market
risk premium should be based on inflation-adjusted expected returns, which would
make it even lower—closer to 1%.19
Our View on the Market Risk Premium.
After reading the previous sections,
you might well be confused about the best way to estimate the market risk premium.
Here’s our opinion: The risk premium is driven primarily by investors’ attitudes to-
ward risk, and there are good reasons to believe that investors’ risk aversion changes
over time. Some factors suggest that the premium has declined. The introduction of
pension plans, Social Security, health insurance, and disability insurance over the last
50 years means that people today can take more chances with their investments,
which should make them less risk averse. Moreover, many households have dual in-
comes, which also allows investors to take more chances. Finally, the historical aver-
age return on the market as Ibbotson measures it is probably too high for two
reasons. The first is survivorship bias: the companies that fail had low returns, so ex-
cluding them raises the average historical return on stocks, which in turn raises the
historical risk premium. The second reason is that increases in required returns cause
decreases in observed returns, and vice versa.
On the other hand, we have recently seen a huge plunge in stock and home prices,
most of us know people who have recently lost their jobs, and the pundits speak of
investors exiting the stock market as a result of recent losses and fears of more losses.
And some analysts who were recently extolling the virtues of “stocks for the long
run” are now recommending T-bonds and other low-risk assets rather than stock.
Putting it all together, we conclude that the true risk premium in 2009 is lower than
Ibbotson’s long-term historical average, but it is certainly not negative as suggested by

some recent data. But just how low is it? In our consulting, we currently (during the bear
market of 2008–2009) use a risk premium of about 6%, but we would have a hard time
arguing with someone who used a risk premium anywhere in the range of 3.5% to 6.5%.
We believe that investors’ aversion to risk is relatively stable much of the time, but it is
not absolutely constant from year to year and is certainly not constant during periods of
great stress, such as during the 2008–2009 financial crisis. When stock prices are rela-
tively high, investors feel less risk averse, so we would use a risk premium at the low
end of our range. Conversely, when prices are depressed, we would use a premium at
the high end of the range. The bottom line is that there is no way to prove that a partic-
ular risk premium is either right or wrong, though we’d be suspicious of an estimated
market premium that is less than 3.0% or greater than 6.5%.20
Estimating Beta
Recall from Chapter 6 that beta can be estimated as the slope coefficient in a regres-
sion, with the company’s stock returns on the y-axis and market returns on the x-axis.
The result is called the historical beta because it is based on historical data. Although
this approach is conceptually straightforward, complications quickly arise in practice.
First, there is no theoretical guidance as to the correct holding period for measuring
returns. The returns for a company can be calculated using daily, weekly, or monthly
periods, and the resulting betas will differ. Beta is also sensitive to the number of years
of data that are used. With too few years, there will be few observations and the regres-
sion will not be statistically significant. On the other hand, with too many years the sta-
tistical significance may be improved but the “true” beta may have changed over the
sample period. In practice, it is common to use either 3 to 5 years of monthly returns,
or perhaps 1 to 2 years of weekly returns. Unfortunately, betas calculated in different
ways can be different, and it is impossible to know for certain which is correct.
A second problem is that the market return should, in theory, reflect returns on
every single asset—even human capital as reflected in people’s earning power. In
practice, however, it is common to use only an index of common stocks such as the
S&P 500, the NYSE Composite, or the Wilshire 5000. Even though these indexes
are correlated with one another, using different indexes in the regression will result
in a different beta, and we would surely obtain a different beta if we broadened the
index to include real estate and other assets.
Third, some organizations modify the calculated historical beta in order to pro-
duce what they deem to be a more accurate estimate of the “true” beta, where the
true beta is the one that reflects the risk perceptions of the marginal investor. One
modification, called an adjusted beta, attempts to correct a possible statistical bias by
adjusting the historical beta to make it closer to the known average beta of 1.0. A
second modification is to estimate a fundamental beta, which incorporates known in-
formation such as any changes in the company’s product lines or capital structure.
Fourth, the estimate of beta for any individual company is statistically imprecise.
The average company has an estimated beta of 1.0, but the 95% confidence interval
ranges from about 0.6 to 1.4. For most companies, if your regression produces an
estimated beta of 1.0, then in general you can only be 95% sure that the true beta
lies within the range from 0.6 to 1.4. This isn’t a big problem with well-diversified
portfolios, but it does add another element of uncertainty when calculating the cost
of equity for a single company.

Chapter 9: The Cost of Capital

The preceding discussion refers to conditions in the United States and other
countries with well-developed financial markets where relatively good data are avail-
able. When we consider countries with less-developed financial markets, we are
much less certain about the true size of a company’s beta. Moreover, further compli-
cations arise when we are dealing with multinational companies, especially those that
raise equity capital in different parts of the world. We might, for example, be rela-
tively confident in the beta calculated for the parent company in its home country
but less confident of the betas for subsidiaries located in other countries. When such
complications arise, we are often forced to make “educated guesses” as to the appropri-
ate beta. It would be nice to have exact, precise numbers for everything and thus be
able to make decisions with a great deal of confidence, but that’s not the way the world
is—we are often forced to use judgment and to make educated guesses. Still, our dis-
cussion should help improve your judgment regarding the choice of beta for use in
cost-of-capital studies, and it should also keep you from being too dogmatic about
the accuracy of your beta and therefore your estimated cost of capital.
One More Caveat Regarding the CAPM Approach
We should point out one more potential problem with the CAPM: It has never been
proven that investors base their required rates of return on the equation rM = rRF +
(RPM)bi. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of studies have been conducted to test the valid-
ity of the CAPM, but there have been no definitive answers. The principal problem is
that the CAPM itself deals only with expectations, yet the tests of the theory (such as the
Fama-French work described in Chapter 6) have necessarily relied on historical data.
Still, we do know that security analysts and portfolio managers rely on the CAPM
for much of their work, and betas are widely publicized. In addition, the CAPM’s
focus on diversification and systematic risk is quite logical, so it makes sense for peo-
ple to use it when they make investment decisions. Therefore, it is reasonable to use
the CAPM when you estimate the cost of equity, as most academics recommend and
most corporate practitioners do. Just recognize that there may be other factors at
work and so—even if you could estimate rRF, bi, and RPM exactly—your estimate of
rs might still not be exact.
An Illustration of the CAPM Approach
To illustrate the CAPM approach, assume that rRF = 5%, RPM = 5.5%, and NCC’s
bi = 1.2. Therefore, NCC is riskier than an average company, and its cost of equity is
about 11.6%:
rs ¼ 5% þ ð5:5%Þð1:2Þ
¼ 5% þ 6:6%
¼ 11:6%
It should be obvious by now that, although the CAPM approach appears to yield precise
estimates of rs, it is impossible to know with certainty the correct values of the required
inputs to make it operational; this is because (1) it is impossible to estimate the required
inputs precisely and (2) even if we knew the correct inputs, it might still turn out that the
CAPM does not perfectly reflect the views of the marginal investor. Still, in our judg-
ment it is possible to develop “reasonable” estimates of the required variables, and we
believe that investors do use the CAPM concept when making decisions; thus that it
can be used to obtain reasonable estimates of the cost of equity capital. Indeed, despite
the difficulties we have pointed out, surveys indicate that the CAPM is the dominant
choice for the vast majority of companies in the United States and around the world.

9.7 DIVIDEND-YIELD-PLUS-GROWTH-RATE, OR
DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW (DCF), APPROACH
In Chapter 7, we saw that if the marginal investor expects dividends to grow at a con-
stant rate and if the company makes all payouts in the form of dividends (the com-
pany does not repurchase stock), then the price of a stock can be found as follows:
P0 ¼ D1
rs −g
(9-8)
Here P0 is the price of the stock, D1 is the dividend expected to be paid at the end of
Year 1, g is the expected growth rate in dividends, and rs is the required rate of re-
turn. Assuming the stock is in equilibrium, we can solve for rs to obtain the required
rate of return on common equity, which for the marginal investor is also equal to the
expected rate of return:
^rs ¼ rs ¼ D1
P0
þ Expected g
(9-9)
Thus, investors expect to receive a dividend yield, D1/P0, plus a capital gain, g, for a
total expected return of ^rs. In equilibrium this expected return is also equal to
the required return, rs. This method of estimating the cost of equity is called the
discounted cash flow, or DCF, method. Henceforth, we will assume that markets
are at equilibrium (which means that rs = ^rs), and this permits us to use the terms rs
and ^rs interchangeably.
Estimating Inputs for the DCF Approach
Three inputs are required to use the DCF approach: the current stock price, the cur-
rent dividend, and the marginal investor’s expected dividend growth rate. The stock
price and the dividend are easy to obtain, but the expected growth rate is difficult to
estimate, as we will see in the following sections.
Historical Growth Rates.
If earnings and dividend growth rates have been rela-
tively stable in the past, and if investors expect these trends to continue, then the
past realized growth rate may be used as an estimate of the expected future growth
rate. This is a reasonable proposition, but such situations occur only at a handful of
very mature, slow-growing companies. Unfortunately, this limits the usefulness of
historical growth rates as predictors of future growth rates for most companies.
Retention Growth Model.
Most firms pay out some of their net income as divi-
dends and reinvest, or retain, the rest. The more they retain, and the higher the earned
rate of return on those retained earnings, the larger their growth rate. This is the idea
behind the retention growth model.
Chapter 9: The Cost of Capital
353

The payout ratio is the percent of net income that the firm pays out in dividends,
and the retention ratio is the complement of the payout ratio: Retention ratio = (1 −
Payout ratio). NCC’s payout ratio has averaged 63% over the past 15 years, so its
retention rate has averaged 1.0 −0.63 = 0.37 = 37%. Also, NCC’s return on equity
(ROE) has averaged 14.5% over the past 15 years. We know that, other things held
constant, the earnings growth rate depends on the amount of income the firm retains
and the rate of return it earns on those retained earnings, and the retention growth
equation can be expressed as follows:
g ¼ ROEðRetention ratioÞ
(9-10)
When we use this equation to estimate the DCF growth rate, we are implicitly making
four important assumptions: (1) we expect the payout rate, and thus the retention rate, to
remain constant; (2) we expect the ROE on new investments to remain constant and
equal to the ROE on existing assets; (3) the firm is not expected to repurchase or issue
new common stock, or, if it does, this new stock will be sold at a price equal to its book
value; and (4) future projects are expected to have the same degree of risk as the firm’s
existing assets. Under these assumptions, the earnings growth rate will be constant, and
it will also be the dividend growth rate.
Using NCC’s 14.5% average ROE and its 37% retention rate, we can use
Equation 9-10 to find the estimated g:
g ¼ 14:5%ð0:37Þ ¼ 5:365 ≈5:4%
Analysts’ Forecasts.
A third technique calls for using security analysts’ forecasts.
As we discussed earlier, analysts publish earnings’ growth rate estimates for most of
the larger publicly owned companies. For example, Value Line provides such forecasts
on about 1,700 companies, and all of the larger brokerage houses provide similar
forecasts. Further, several companies compile analysts’ forecasts on a regular basis
and provide summary information such as the median and range of forecasts on
widely followed companies. These growth rate summaries, such as those compiled
by Zacks or by Thomson ONE—BSE, can be found on the Internet. These earnings
growth rates are often used as proxies for dividend growth rates.
Note, however, that analysts’ forecasts often involve nonconstant growth. For ex-
ample, one widely followed analyst forecasted that NCC would have a 10.4% annual
growth rate in earnings and dividends over the next 5 years, after which the growth
rate would decline to 5%. Such nonconstant growth forecasts can be converted to an
approximate constant growth rate. Computer simulations indicate that dividends be-
yond Year 50 contribute very little to the value of any stock—the present value of all
dividends beyond Year 50 is virtually zero, so for practical purposes we can ignore
anything beyond 50 years. If we consider only a 50-year horizon, then we can de-
velop a weighted average growth rate and use it as a constant growth rate for cost-
of-capital purposes. In the NCC case, we assume a growth rate of 10.4% for 5 years
followed by a growth rate of 5% for 45 years. We weight the short-term growth by
5/50 = 10% and the long-term growth by 45/50 = 90%. This produces an average
growth rate of 0.10(10.4%) + 0.90(5%) = 5.54% ≈5.5%.21

For example, see http://
www.zacks.com.
21Instead of converting nonconstant growth estimates into an approximate average growth rate, it is pos-
sible to use the nonconstant growth estimates to estimate directly the required return on common stock.

Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

Applying the DCF Approach.
To illustrate the DCF approach, suppose NCC’s
stock sells for $32, its next expected dividend is $1.82, and its expected growth rate is
5.5%. NCC is not expected to repurchase any stock. NCC’s stock is thought to be in
equilibrium, so its expected and required rates of return are equal. Based on these
assumptions, its estimated DCF cost of common equity is 11.2%:
^rs ¼ rs ¼ $1:82
$32:00 þ 5:5%
¼ 5:7% þ 5:5%
¼ 11:2%
Evaluating the Methods for Estimating Growth
Observe that the DCF approach finds the cost of common equity as the dividend
yield (the expected dividend divided by the current price) plus the growth rate.
The dividend yield can be estimated without much error, but there is uncertainty
in the growth estimate. We would like to know the expected average growth rate
as forecasted by the marginal investor, but that rate simply cannot be observed.
However, we have considered three methods that can be used to estimate ex-
pected future growth: (1) historical growth rates, which implicitly assume that in-
vestors expect past results to be repeated in the future; (2) the retention growth
model, which implicitly assumes that investors expect historical payout ratios and
ROEs to be repeated; and (3) analysts’ forecasts. Of these three methods, the
third is the most logical. Moreover, studies have also shown that analysts’ fore-
casts usually predict actual future growth better than the other methods. We rec-
ommend a primary reliance on analysts’ forecasts for the growth rate in DCF cost
of capital estimates.22

9.8 OVER-OWN-BOND-YIELD-PLUS-JUDGMENTAL-
RISK-PREMIUM APPROACH
Some analysts use a subjective, ad hoc procedure to estimate a firm’s cost of common
equity: They simply add a judgmental risk premium of 3% to 5% to the interest rate
on the firm’s own long-term debt. It is logical to think that firms with risky, low-
rated, and hence high–interest rate debt will also have risky, high-cost equity, and
the procedure for basing the cost of equity on a readily observable debt cost utilizes
this logic. In this approach,
rs ¼ Company’s own bond yield þ Judgmental risk premium
(9-11)
22See Robert Harris, “Using Analysts’ Growth Rate Forecasts to Estimate Shareholder Required Rates of
Return,” Financial Management, Spring 1986, pp. 58–67.
Chapter 9: The Cost of Capital
355

NCC’s bonds yield 9.0%, so if its over-own-bond-yield judgmental risk premium is
estimated as 3% then its estimated cost of equity is 12%:
rs ¼ 9% þ 3% ¼ 12%
Because the risk premium is a judgmental estimate, the estimated value of rs is
also judgmental. Similarly, though, a lot of judgment goes into the CAPM and
DCF estimates of rs. Empirical work suggests that the risk premium over a firm’s
own bond yield generally has ranged from 3 to 5 percentage points.23 Therefore,
this method is not likely to produce a precise cost of equity, but it can help “get us
into the ballpark.”

9.9 COMPARISON OF THE CAPM, DCF, AND OVER-
OWN-BOND-YIELD-PLUS-JUDGMENTAL-RISK-PREMIUM
METHODS
We have discussed three methods for estimating the cost of common stock. For
NCC, the CAPM estimate is 11.6%, the DCF constant growth estimate is 11.2%,
and the over-own-bond-yield-plus-judgmental-risk-premium estimate is 12%. The
overall average of these three methods is (11.6% + 11.2% + 12%)/3 = 11.6%. These
results are unusually close, so it would make little difference which one we used.
However, if the methods produced widely varied estimates, then a financial analyst
would have to use his or her own best judgment regarding the relative merits of
each estimate and then choose one that seemed reasonable under the circumstances.
Recent surveys indicate that the CAPM is by far the most widely used method.
Although most firms use more than one method, almost 74% of respondents in one
survey (and 85% in another) used the CAPM.24 This is in sharp contrast to a 1982
survey, which found that only 30% of respondents used the CAPM.25 Only 16% now
use the DCF approach, down from 31% in 1982. The bond-yield-plus-judgmental-
risk-premium is relied upon primarily by companies that are not publicly traded.
People experienced in estimating the cost of equity recognize that both careful
analysis and sound judgment are required. It would be nice to pretend that judgment
is unnecessary and to specify an easy, precise way of determining the exact cost of
23Analysts have surveyed portfolio managers, asking how much more they would have to expect to earn
on a firm’s stock versus its bonds to induce them to buy the stock. The range we have seen is 3% to 5%,
which is what we use. Discussions with financial executives indicate that most are comfortable with this
range. All this is purely judgmental, but that’s the case for much of finance.
24See John R. Graham and Campbell Harvey, “The Theory and Practice of Corporate Finance: Evidence
from the Field,” Journal of Financial Economics, 2001, pp. 187–243, and the paper cited in footnote 10. It is
interesting that a growing number of firms (about 34%) also are using CAPM-type models with more
than one factor. Of these firms, over 40% include factors for interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, and
business cycle risk (proxied by gross domestic product). More than 20% of these firms include a factor for
inflation, size, and exposure to particular commodity prices. Less than 20% of these firms make adjust-
ments due to distress factors, book-to-market ratios, or momentum factors.

equity capital. Unfortunately, this is not possible—finance is in large part a matter of
judgment, and we simply must face that fact.26
Self-Test
Which approach for estimating the required return on common stock is used most
often by businesses today?
9.10 ADJUSTING THE COST OF EQUITY
FOR FLOTATION COSTS
As explained earlier, most mature companies rely primarily on reinvesting a large
portion of their earnings and hence rarely issue new common stock. However, for
those that do, the cost of new common equity, re, or external equity, is higher
than the cost of equity raised internally by reinvesting earnings, rs, because of the
flotation costs involved in issuing new common stock. What rate of return must be
earned on new investments to make issuing stock worthwhile? Put another way, what
is the cost of new common stock?
The answer, for a constant growth firm, is found by applying this formula:
re ¼ ^re ¼
D1
P0ð1 −FÞ þ g
(9-12)
In Equation 9-10, F is the percentage flotation cost incurred in selling the new stock,
so here P0(1 −F) is the net price per share received by the company.
Using the same inputs as when we estimated NCC’s cost of common equity using
the DCF approach—but assuming that NCC incurs a flotation cost of 12.5% to sell
new common stock—its cost of new outside equity is calculated as follows:
re ¼
$1:82
$32ð1 −0:125Þ þ 5:5%
¼ 6:5% þ 5:5% ¼ 12:0%
As we calculated earlier using the DCF model (but ignoring flotation costs), NCC’s
stockholders require a return of rs = 11.2%. However, because of flotation costs
the company must earn more than 11.2% on the net funds it has to invest if investors
are to receive an 11.2% return on the money they actually contributed. Specifically,
if the firm earns 12.0% on net funds obtained by issuing new stock, then earnings per
share will remain at the previously expected level, the firm’s expected dividend can be
maintained, and so the price per share will not decline. If it earns less than 12.0%
then earnings, dividends, and growth will fall below expectations, which will cause a
decline in the stock price. If it earns more than 12.0%, the stock price will rise.
As we noted previously, most analysts use the CAPM to estimate the cost of
equity. In an earlier section, we estimated NCC’s CAPM cost of equity as 11.6%.
How would the analyst incorporate flotation costs into a CAPM cost estimate?
If application of the DCF methodology gives a cost of internally generated equity of
26One senior executive told us that, in his judgment, the CAPM’s popularity was partly the result of
lower-level staffers wanting to use methods that can be defended by reference to the finance literature
and to “hard” numbers based on published data, like historical betas and risk premiums. His conclusion
was that the CAPM’s use with historical data is widely discussed in the finance literature and taught in
MBA programs, so the result is sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy. He went on to say that in his opinion a
great deal of judgment is required; in his company, lower-level staffers derived relatively precise results
and then experienced, senior managers applied judgment when making decisions based on those results.
He thought this procedure worked out well for his company.
Chapter 9: The Cost of Capital

11.2% but a cost of 12.0% when flotation costs are involved, then the flotation costs
add 0.8 percentage points to the cost of equity. To incorporate flotation costs into
the CAPM estimate, we would simply add 0.8% to the 11.6% CAPM estimate, re-
sulting in a 12.4% estimated cost of external equity. As an alternative, you could
find the average of the CAPM, DCF, and over-own-bond-yield-plus-judgmental-
risk-premium costs of equity (ignoring flotation costs) and then add to it the 0.8 per-
centage points to adjust for flotation costs.
Table 9-1 shows the average flotation costs for debt and equity issued by U.S. cor-
porations in the 1990s. The common stock flotation costs are for non-IPO issues.
For IPOs, flotation costs are higher: about 17% higher if less than $10 million is
raised and higher still as issue size increases. The data in Table 9-1 include both util-
ity and nonutility companies; if utilities had been excluded, the reported flotation
costs would have been higher. Table 9-1 shows that flotation costs are significantly
higher for equity than for debt. Notice that all flotation costs, as a percentage of capi-
tal raised, fall as the amount of capital raised increases.
The lower cost for issuing debt results from two factors. First, debt is a contractual
obligation; hence returns are more predictable, which makes selling debt easier. Second,
corporate debt is sold mainly in large blocks to institutional investors, whereas common
stock is sold in smaller amounts to many different investors; this imposes higher costs
on the investment banks, who pass these costs on to the issuing company.

raise new capital in a manner that will keep the actual capital structure on target
over time. In this chapter, we assume that the firm has identified its optimal capital
structure, that it uses this optimum as the target, and that it finances so as to remain
constantly on target. How the target is established is examined in Chapter 15. The
target proportions of debt, preferred stock, and common equity, along with the com-
ponent costs of capital, are used to calculate the WACC, as shown previously in
Equation 9-1:
WACC ¼ wdrdð1 −TÞ þ wpsrps þ wsrs
(9-1)
Here wd, wps, and ws are the target weights for debt, preferred, and common equity,
respectively.27
To illustrate, we first note that NCC has a target capital structure calling for 30%
debt, 10% preferred stock, and 60% common equity. Its before-tax cost of debt, rd, is
9%; its cost of preferred stock, rps, is 8.2%; its cost of common equity, rs, is 11.6%;
its marginal tax rate is 40%; and all of its new equity will come from reinvested earn-
ings. We can now calculate NCC’s weighted average cost of capital as follows:
WACC ¼ 0:3ð9:0%Þð1 −0:4Þ þ 0:1ð8:2%Þ þ 0:6ð11:6%Þ
¼ 9:4%
Three points should be noted. First, the WACC is the cost the company would
incur to raise each new, or marginal, dollar of capital—it is not the average cost of
dollars raised in the past. Second, the percentages of each capital component, called
weights, should be based on management’s target capital structure, not on the partic-
ular sources of financing in any single year. Third, the target weights should be based
on market values and not on book values. We discuss these points in what follows.
Marginal Rates versus Historical Rates
The required rates of return for a company’s investors, whether they are new or old,
are always marginal rates. For example, a stockholder might have invested in a com-
pany last year when the risk-free interest rate was 6% and the required return on
equity was 12%. If the risk-free rate subsequently falls and is now 4%, then the in-
vestor’s required return on equity is now 10% (holding all else constant). This is the
same required rate of return that a new equity holder would have, whether the new
investor bought stock in the secondary market or through a new equity offering. In
other words, whether the shareholders are already equity holders or are brand-new
equity holders, they all have the same required rate of return, which is the current
required rate of return on equity. The same reasoning applies for the firm’s bond-
holders. All bondholders, whether old or new, have a required rate of return equal
to today’s yield on the firm’s debt, which is based on current market conditions.
Because investors’ required rates of return are based on current market conditions,
not on market conditions when they purchased their securities, it follows that the
cost of capital depends on current conditions and not on past market conditions.
27If a company also used short-term debt as a permanent source of financing, then its cost of capital
would be:
WACC ¼ wdrdð1  TÞ þ wSTDrSTDð1  TÞ þ wpsrps þ wsrs
ð9-1aÞ
where wSTD is the percentage of the firm that is financed with short-term debt and rSTD is the cost of
short-term debt.
Chapter 9: The Cost of Capital
359

Target Weights versus Annual Financing Choices
We have heard managers (and students!) say, “Our debt has a 5% after-tax cost ver-
sus a 10% WACC and a 14% cost of equity. Therefore, since we will finance only
with debt this year, we should evaluate this year’s projects at a 5% cost.” There are
two flaws in that line of reasoning.
First, suppose the firm exhausts its capacity to issue low-cost debt this year to take
on projects with after-tax returns as low as 5.1% (which is slightly higher than the
after-tax cost of debt). Then next year, when the firm must finance with common
equity, it will have to turn down projects with returns as high as 13.9% (which is
slightly lower than the cost of equity). To avoid this problem, a firm that plans to
remain in business indefinitely should evaluate all projects using the 10% WACC.
Second, both existing and new investors have claims on all future cash flows. For
example, if a company raises debt and also invests in a new project that same year, the
new debtholders don’t have a specific claim on that specific project’s cash flows (as-
suming it is not non-recourse project financing). In fact, new debtholders receive a
claim on the cash flows being generated by existing as well as new projects, while
old debtholders (and equity holders) have claims on both new and existing projects.
Thus, the decision to take on a new project should depend on the project’s ability to
satisfy all of the company’s investors, not just the new debtholders, even if only debt
is being raised that year.
Weights for Component Costs: Book Values versus
Market Values versus Targets
Our primary reason for calculating the WACC is to use it in capital budgeting or
corporate valuation, since we need to compare the expected returns on projects and
companies with the cost of the funds used to finance them. As Figure 9-1 showed,
accountants report financial statements in book value terms, but financial analysts
can convert those numbers into market values.
At one time academics—and, to a lesser extent, financial executives—debated
whether we should use book value versus market value weights when estimating the
cost of capital. The main arguments in favor of book weights were (1) these are the
numbers shown on financial statements, (2) the bond rating agencies seem to focus
on book weights, and (3) book values are more stable than market values, so book
value weights produce more stable inputs for use in capital budgeting. The main ar-
guments in favor of market value weights were (1) firms raise funds by selling securi-
ties at their market values, not at book values, and (2) market values are more
consistent with the idea of value maximization.
Market value supporters won the argument, as they should have, but in a dynamic
world it is simply not feasible to blindly and mechanically focus on current market
value weights (i.e., on the market value weights given in Column J of Figure 9-1).
As a result of the stock market crash of 2008–2009, many firms saw their equity ra-
tios drop from about 75% to near 10%, and managers concluded that neither the
book value nor market value numbers represented how they wanted to finance in
the future. Thus, they didn’t want to use either book value or market value weights.
What they did, as we discuss in Chapter 15, was focus on a less mechanical, more
judgmental capital structure—the Target Capital Structure. At the target structure,
the firm uses enough debt to gain the benefits of interest tax shields and also le-
verages up earnings per share. However, the amount of debt is not so great that it
subjects the firm to a high probability of financial distress during a period of eco-
nomic recession. Managements have some flexibility in setting their target capital
360
Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

structures, but they are also subject to constraints and market forces. Firms compare
their data with those of benchmark firms in their industry; this allows firms to see
how they are doing relative to other firms in their industry. If a company uses too
little debt then its earnings will be lower than they could have been without subject-
ing the firm to undue risk, and individual stockholders, private equity firms, or hedge
firms will probably challenge management and force it toward the optimal structure.
If a company uses too much debt, then lenders will raise interest rates or perhaps
refuse to lend at all, rating agencies and analysts will report on its risky situation,
the intrinsic value of the firm’s stock will decline, and its market value will suffer.
Thus, forces exist to compel firms to set their target capital structures at levels that
will maximize their intrinsic values and thus their stock prices.
Finally, note that an optimal capital structure in one economic environment may
not be optimal under different market conditions. In a dynamic economy it is impor-
tant to constantly monitor the situation and make adjustments to the target capital
structure as circumstances change.

A firm has the following data: target capital structure of 25% debt, 10% preferred

Assume the firm will not issue new stock. What is this firm’s WACC? (9.28%)
9.12 FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE WACC
The cost of capital is affected by some factors that are under a firm’s control and
some that are not.
Three Factors the Firm Cannot Control
Three key determinants of WACC are beyond a firm’s control: (1) the state of the
financial markets, including stock prices in general and the level of interest rates;
(2) investors’ aversion to risk and thus the market risk premium; and (3) tax rates as
set by Congress.
Global Variations in the Cost of Capital
For U.S. firms to be competitive with foreign companies,
they must have a cost of capital no greater than that
faced by their international competitors. In the past,
many experts argued that U.S. firms were at a disadvan-
tage. In particular, Japanese firms enjoyed a very low
cost of capital, which lowered their total costs and thus
made it hard for U.S. firms to compete with them. Recent
events, however, have considerably narrowed cost-
of-capital differences between U.S. and Japanese firms.
In particular, the U.S. stock market has outperformed the
Japanese market in recent years, which has made it eas-
ier and cheaper for U.S. firms to raise equity capital.
As capital markets become increasingly integrated,
cross-country differences in the cost of capital are de-
clining. Today, most large corporations raise capital
throughout the world; hence, we are moving toward
one global capital market instead of distinct capital mar-
kets in each country. Government policies and market
conditions can affect the cost of capital within a given
country, but this primarily affects smaller firms that do
not have access to global capital markets, and even
these differences are becoming less important as time
passes. What matters most is the risk of the individual
firm, not the market in which it raises capital.

Stock and Bond Markets.
The stock and bond markets, and the market for
short-term debt, are normally in equilibrium and thus fairly stable. However, at times
the markets are disrupted, making it virtually impossible for a firm to raise capital at
reasonable rates. This happened in 2008 and 2009, before the U.S. Treasury and the
Federal Reserve intervened to open up the capital markets. During such times, firms
tend to cut back on growth plans; if they must raise capital, its cost can be extraordi-
narily high. For example, see the box “GE and Warren Buffett: The Cost of Pre-
ferred Stock” presented earlier in the chapter.
Note also that if interest rates in the economy rise, the costs of both debt and equity
will increase. The firm will have to pay bondholders a higher interest rate to obtain debt
capital; and, as indicated in our discussion of the CAPM, higher interest rates also in-
crease the cost of equity. Interest rates are heavily influenced by inflation. When infla-
tion hit historic highs in the early 1980s, interest rates followed, but they trended down
until the financial crisis in 2008 led to an upward spike. However, strong actions by the
federal government in the spring of 2009 brought rates back down. These actions should
encourage investment, and there is little doubt that they will eventually lead the econ-
omy out of its recession. However, many observers fear that the government’s actions
will also reignite long-run inflation, which would lead to higher interest rates.28
Market Risk Premium.
Investors’ aversion to risk determines the market risk
premium. Individual firms have no control over the RPM, which affects the cost of
equity and thus the WACC.
Tax Rates.
Tax rates, which are influenced by the president and set by Congress,
have an important effect on the cost of capital. They are used when we calculate the
after-tax cost of debt for use in the WACC. In addition, the lower tax rate on divi-
dends and capital gains than on interest income favors financing with stock rather
than bonds, as we discuss in detail in Chapter 15.
Three Factors the Firm Can Control
A firm can affect its cost of capital through (1) its capital structure policy, (2) its divi-
dend policy, and (3) its investment (capital budgeting) policy.
Capital Structure Policy.
In the current chapter we assume that the firm has a
given target capital structure, and we use weights based on that target to calculate
its WACC. However, a firm can change its capital structure, and such a change can
affect its cost of capital. For example, the after-tax cost of debt is lower than the cost
of equity, so if the firm decides to use more debt and less common equity, then this
increase in debt will tend to lower the WACC. However, an increased use of debt
will increase the risk of debt and the equity, offsetting to some extent the effect due
to a greater weighting of debt. In Chapter 15 we discuss this in more depth, and we
demonstrate that the optimal capital structure is the one that minimizes the WACC
and simultaneously maximizes the intrinsic value of the stock.
Dividend Policy.
As we will see in Chapter 14, the percentage of earnings paid
out in dividends may affect a stock’s required rate of return, rs. Also, if the payout
ratio is so high that the firm must issue new stock to fund its capital budget, then
the resulting flotation costs will also affect the WACC.
28Other things held constant, if the government doubles the money supply then there would be twice as
many dollars chasing the same amount of goods, and this would eventually lead to inflation. So one cost
of the stimulus program may be higher inflation.

Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

Investment Policy.
When we estimate the cost of capital, we use as the starting
point the required rates of return on the firm’s outstanding stock and bonds, which
reflect the risks inherent in the existing assets. Therefore, we are implicitly assuming
that new capital will be invested in assets with the same degree of risk as existing as-
sets. This assumption is generally correct, because most firms do invest in assets sim-
ilar to those they currently use. However, the equal risk assumption is incorrect if a
firm dramatically changes its investment policy. For example, if a company invests in
an entirely new line of business, then its marginal cost of capital should reflect the
risk of that new business. With hindsight we can therefore see that GE’s huge invest-
ments in the TV and movie businesses, as well as its investment in mortgages, in-
creased its risk and thus its cost of capital.

cost of capital.

9.13 ADJUSTING THE COST OF CAPITAL FOR RISK
As we have calculated it, the weighted average cost of capital reflects the average risk
and overall capital structure of the entire firm. No adjustments are needed when
using the WACC as the discount rate when estimating the value of a company by
discounting its cash flows. However, adjustments for risk are often needed when eval-
uating a division or project. For example, what if a firm has divisions in several busi-
ness lines that differ in risk? Or what if a company is considering a project that is
much riskier than its typical project? It is not logical to use the overall cost of capital
to discount divisional or project-specific cash flows that don’t have the same risk as
the company’s average cash flows. The following sections explain how to adjust the
cost of capital for divisions and for specific projects.
Divisional Costs of Capital
Consider Starlight Sandwich Shops, a company with two divisions—a bakery opera-
tion and a chain of cafes. The bakery division is low-risk and has a 10% WACC. The
cafe division is riskier and has a 14% WACC. Each division is approximately the
same size, so Starlight’s overall cost of capital is 12%. The bakery manager has a
project with an 11% expected rate of return, and the cafe division manager has a
project with a 13% expected return. Should these projects be accepted or rejected?
Starlight will create value if it accepts the bakery’s project, since its rate of return is
greater than its cost of capital (11% > 10%), but the cafe project’s rate of return is
less than its cost of capital (13% < 14%), so it should reject that project. However,
if management simply compared the two projects’ returns with Starlight’s 12% over-
all cost of capital, then the bakery’s value-adding project would be rejected while the
cafe’s value-destroying project would be accepted.
Many firms use the CAPM to estimate the cost of capital for specific divisions. To
begin, recall that the Security Market Line (SML) equation expresses the risk–return
relationship as follows:
rs ¼ rRF þ ðRPMÞbi
As an example, consider the case of Huron Steel Company, an integrated steel pro-
ducer operating in the Great Lakes region. For simplicity, assume that Huron has
Chapter 9: The Cost of Capital
363

only one division and uses only equity capital, so its cost of equity is also its corporate
cost of capital, or WACC. Huron’s beta = b = 1.1, rRF = 5%, and RPM = 6%. Thus,
Huron’s cost of equity (and WACC) is 11.6%:
rs ¼ 5% þ ð6%Þ1:1 ¼ 11:6%
This suggests that investors should be willing to give Huron money to invest in
new, average-risk projects if the company expects to earn 11.6% or more on this
money. By “average risk” we mean projects having risk similar to the firm’s existing
division.
Now suppose Huron creates a new transportation division consisting of a fleet of
barges to haul iron ore, and suppose barge operations typically have betas of 1.5
rather than 1.1. The barge division, with b = 1.5, has a 14.0% cost of capital:
rBarge ¼ 5% þ ð6%Þ1:5 ¼ 14:0%
On the other hand, if Huron adds a low-risk division, such as a new distribution cen-
ter with a beta of only 0.5, then that division’s cost of capital would be 8%:
rCenter ¼ 5% þ ð6%Þ0:5 ¼ 8:0%
A firm itself may be regarded as a “portfolio of assets,” and since the beta of a port-
folio is a weighted average of the betas of its individual assets, adding the barge and
distribution center divisions will change Huron’s overall beta. The exact value of the
new corporate beta would depend on the size of the investments in the new divisions
relative to Huron’s original steel operations. If 70% of Huron’s total value ends up in
the steel division, 20% in the barge division, and 10% in the distribution center, then
its new corporate beta would be calculated as follows:
New beta ¼ 0:7ð1:1Þ þ 0:2ð1:5Þ þ 0:1ð0:5Þ ¼ 1:12
Thus, investors in Huron’s stock would require a return of
rHuron ¼ 5% þ ð6%Þ1:12 ¼ 11:72%
Even though investors require an overall return of 11.72%, they should expect a
rate of return on projects in each division at least as high as the division’s required
return based on the SML. In particular, they should expect a return of at least
11.6% from the steel division, 14.0% from the barge division, and 8.0% from the
distribution center.
Obviously, our example suggests a level of precision that is much higher than firms
can obtain in the real world. Still, managers should be aware of the logic of our exam-
ple, and they should strive to measure the required inputs as well as possible.
Techniques for Measuring Divisional Betas
In Chapter 6 we discussed the estimation of betas for stocks and indicated how diffi-
cult it is to measure beta precisely. Estimating divisional betas is much more difficult,
primarily because divisions do not have their own publicly traded stock.29 Therefore,
we must estimate the beta that the division would have if it were an independent,
publicly traded company. Two approaches can be used to estimate divisional betas:
the pure play method and the accounting beta method.
The Pure Play Method.
In the pure play method, the company tries to find the
betas of several publicly held specialized companies in the same line of business as the
29This same problem applies to privately held companies, which we discuss in Section 9.14.
364
Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

division being evaluated, and it then averages those betas to determine the cost of
capital for its own division. For example, suppose Huron found three companies de-
voted exclusively to operating barges, and suppose that Huron’s management believes
its barge division would be subject to the same risks as those firms. Then Huron
could use the average beta of those firms as a proxy for its barge division’s beta.30
The Accounting Beta Method.
As noted above, it may be impossible to find spe-
cialized publicly traded firms suitable for the pure play approach. If that is the case,
we may be able to use the accounting beta method. Betas are normally found by
regressing the returns of a particular company’s stock against returns on a stock market
index. However, we could run a regression of the division’s accounting return on assets
against the average return on assets for a large sample of companies, such as those in-
cluded in the S&P 500. Betas determined in this way (that is, by using accounting
data rather than stock market data) are called accounting betas.
Estimating the Cost of Capital for Individual Projects
In Chapter 11 we examine ways to estimate the risk inherent in individual projects,
but at this point it is useful to consider how project risk is reflected in measures of
the firm’s cost of capital. First, although it is intuitively clear that riskier projects
have a higher cost of capital, it is difficult to measure projects’ relative risks. Also,
note that three separate and distinct types of risk can be identified as follows.
1. Stand-alone risk, which is the variability of the project’s expected returns.
2. Corporate, or within-firm, risk, which is the variability the project contributes
to the corporation’s returns, giving consideration to the fact that the project
represents only one asset of the firm’s portfolio of assets and so some of its
risk will be diversified away.
3. Market, or beta, risk, which is the risk of the project as seen by a well-
diversified stockholder who owns many different stocks. A project’s market risk
is measured by its effect on the firm’s overall beta coefficient.
Taking on a project with a high degree of either stand-alone or corporate risk will
not necessarily increase the corporate beta. However, if the project has highly uncer-
tain returns and if those returns are highly correlated with returns on the firm’s other
assets and with most other assets in the economy, then the project will have a high
degree of all types of risk. For example, suppose General Motors decides to under-
take a major expansion to build electric autos. GM is not sure how its technology will
work on a mass production basis, so there is much risk in the venture—its stand-
alone risk is high. Management also estimates that the project will do best if the
economy is strong, for then people will have more money to spend on automobiles.
This means that the project will tend to do well if GM’s other divisions are doing
well but will do poorly if other divisions are doing poorly. This being the case, the
project will also have a high degree of corporate risk. Finally, since GM’s profits are
highly correlated with those of most other firms, the project’s beta will also be high.
Thus, this project will be risky under all three definitions of risk.
Of the three measures, market risk is theoretically the most relevant because of its
direct effect on stock prices. Unfortunately, the market risk for a project is also the
30If the pure play firms employ different capital structures than that of Huron, then this must be ad-
dressed by adjusting the beta coefficients. See Chapter 15 for a discussion of this aspect of the pure play
method. For a technique that can be used when pure play firms are not available, see Yatin Bhagwat and
Michael Ehrhardt, “A Full Information Approach for Estimating Divisional Betas,” Financial Management,
Summer 1991, pp. 60–69.

most difficult to estimate. In practice, most decision makers consider all three risk
measures in a subjective manner.
The first step is to determine the divisional cost of capital before grouping divisional
projects into subjective risk categories. Then, using the divisional WACC as a starting
point, risk-adjusted costs of capital are developed for each category. For example, a
firm might establish three risk classes—high, average, and low—and then assign
average-risk projects the divisional cost of capital, higher-risk projects an above-average
cost, and lower-risk projects a below-average cost. Thus, if a division’s WACC were
10%, its managers might use 10% to evaluate average-risk projects in the division, 12%
for high-risk projects, and 8% for low-risk projects. Although this approach is better than
ignoring project risk, these adjustments are necessarily subjective and somewhat arbi-
trary. Unfortunately, given the data, there is no completely satisfactory way to specify ex-
actly how much higher or lower we should go in setting risk-adjusted costs of capital.

9.14 PRIVATELY OWNED FIRMS AND SMALL BUSINESSES
Up until now, our discussion of the cost of common equity has been focused on pub-
licly owned corporations. When we estimated the rate of return required by public
stockholders, we used stock prices as input data for the DCF method and used stock
returns to estimate beta as an input for the CAPM approach. But how can one mea-
sure the cost of equity for a firm whose stock is not traded? Most analysts begin by
identifying one or more publicly traded firms that are in the same industry and that
are approximately the same size as the privately owned firm.31 The analyst then esti-
mates the betas for these publicly traded firms and uses their average beta as an esti-
mate of the beta of the privately owned firm. This is similar to the pure play method
discussed earlier for estimating divisional betas. With an estimate of beta, the cost of
equity can be estimated using the CAPM approach.
The stock of a privately held firm is less liquid than that of a publicly held firm.
Just as investors demand a liquidity premium on thinly traded bonds, they also add a
liquidity premium to obtain the required return on a privately held firm’s stock.32
Many analysts make an ad hoc adjustment to reflect this lack of liquidity by adding
1 to 3 percentage points to the firm’s cost of equity. This “rule of thumb” is not the-
oretically satisfying because we don’t know exactly how large the liquidity premium
should be, but it is logical and is also a common practice.33
31In Chapter 15 we show how to adjust for differences in capital structures.
32See Yakov Amihud and Haim Mendelson, “Liquidity and Cost of Capital: Implications for Corporate
Management,” Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, Fall 1989, pp. 65–73.
33In fact, some analysts make a similar liquidity adjustment for any small firm’s cost of common equity
even if the firm is publicly traded. Ibbotson Association’s data, discussed earlier in the chapter in connec-
tion with historical risk premiums, support this position: the smaller the firm, the larger the historical risk
premiums.

Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

In addition to the difficulty of estimating the cost of equity for small and privately
held firms, there are also problems in estimating their proper capital structure
weights. These weights should take account of the firm’s market value weights. How-
ever, a privately held firm can’t directly observe its market value, so it can’t directly
observe its market value weights. To resolve this problem, many analysts begin by
making a trial guess as to the value of the firm’s equity. The analysts then use this
estimated value of equity to estimate the cost of capital, next use the cost of capital
to estimate the value of the firm, and finally complete the circle by using the esti-
mated value of the firm to estimate the value of its equity.34 If this newly estimated
equity value is different from their trial guess, analysts repeat the process but start the
iteration with the newly estimated equity value as the trial value of equity. After sev-
eral iterations, the trial value of equity and the resulting estimated equity value usu-
ally converge. Although somewhat tedious, this process provides consistent estimates
of the weights and the cost of capital.

9.15 FOUR MISTAKES TO AVOID
We often see managers and students make the following mistakes when estimating
the cost of capital. Although we have discussed these errors previously at separate
places in the chapter, they are worth repeating here.
1. Never base the cost of debt on the coupon rate on a firm’s existing debt. The cost of debt
must be based on the interest rate the firm would pay if it issued new debt today.
2. When estimating the market risk premium for the CAPM method, never use the his-
torical average return on stocks in conjunction with the current return on T-bonds. The
historical average return on bonds should be subtracted from the past average
return on stocks to calculate the historical market risk premium. On the other
hand, it is appropriate to subtract today’s yield on T-bonds from an estimate of
the expected future return on stocks to obtain the forward-looking market risk
premium. A case can be made for using either the historical or the current risk
premium, but it would be wrong to take the historical rate of return on stocks,
subtract from it the current rate on T-bonds, and then use the difference as the
market risk premium.
3. Never use the current book value capital structure to obtain the weights when estimating
the WACC. Your first choice should be to use the firm’s target capital structure
for the weights. However, if you are an outside analyst and do not know the
target weights, it would probably be best to estimate weights based on the current
market values of the capital components. If the company’s debt is not publicly
traded, then it is reasonable to use the book value of debt to estimate the weights
because book and market values of debt, especially short-term debt, are usually
close to one another. However, stocks’ market values in recent years have gener-
ally been at least 2–3 times their book values, so using book values for equity
could lead to serious errors. The bottom line: If you don’t know the target
weights then use the market value, not the book value, of equity when calculating
the WACC.
4. Always remember that capital components are funds that come from investors. If it’s not
from an investor, then it’s not a capital component. Sometimes the argument is

made that accounts payable and accruals should be included in the calculation of
the WACC. However, these funds are not provided by investors. Instead, they
arise from operating relationships with suppliers and employees. Such funds are
not included when calculating free cash flows, and they are not included when we
calculate the amount of capital needed in a capital budgeting analysis. Therefore,
they should not be included when we calculate the WACC.

Summary
This chapter discussed how the cost of capital is developed for use in capital budget-
ing. The key points covered are listed below.
•
Much of the chapter was devoted to pointing out the problems encountered
when estimating the cost of capital. Although these problems are not trivial, the
state of the art in cost-of-capital estimation is really not in bad shape. The pro-
cedures outlined in this chapter can be used to obtain cost-of-capital estimates
that are sufficiently accurate for practical purposes.
•
The cost of capital used in capital budgeting is a weighted average of the types
of capital the firm uses—typically debt, preferred stock, and common equity.
•
The component cost of debt is the after-tax cost of new debt. It is found by
multiplying the interest rate paid on new debt by 1 −T, where T is the firm’s
marginal tax rate: rd(1 −T).
•
Most debt is raised directly from lenders without the use of investment bankers,
hence no flotation costs are incurred. However, a debt flotation cost adjust-
ment should be made if large flotation costs are incurred. We reduce the bond’s
issue price by the flotation expenses, reduce the bond’s cash flows to reflect taxes,
and then solve for the after-tax yield to maturity.
•
The component cost of preferred stock is calculated as the preferred dividend
divided by the net price the firm receives after deducting flotation costs: rps =
Dps/[Pps(1 −F)]. Flotation costs on preferred stock are usually fairly high, so we
typically include the impact of flotation costs when estimating rps. Also note that
if the preferred stock is convertible into common stock, then the true cost of the
preferred stock will exceed the flotation-adjusted yield of the preferred dividend.
•
The cost of common equity, rs, also called the cost of common stock, is the rate
of return required by the firm’s stockholders, and it can be estimated in three ways:
(1) the CAPM; (2) the dividend-yield-plus-growth-rate, or DCF, approach; and
(3) the over-own-bond-yield-plus-judgmental-risk-premium approach.
•
To use the CAPM approach, we (1) estimate the firm’s beta, (2) multiply this
beta by the market risk premium to obtain the firm’s risk premium, and then
(3) add the firm’s risk premium to the risk-free rate to obtain its cost of common
stock: rs = rRF + (RPM)bi.
•
The best proxy for the risk-free rate is the yield on long-term T-bonds, with 10
years the maturity used most frequently.
•
To use the dividend-yield-plus-growth-rate approach, which is also called the
discounted cash flow (DCF) approach, add the firm’s expected dividend
growth rate to its expected dividend yield: rs ¼ ^rs ¼ D1=P0 þ g. Web Extension
9A shows how to estimate the DCF cost of equity if dividends are not growing at
a constant rate.
368
Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

•
The growth rate for use in the DCF model can be based on security analysts’
published forecasts, on historical growth rates of earnings and dividends, or
on the retention growth model, g = (1 −Payout)(Return on equity).
•
The over-own-bond-yield-plus-judgmental-risk-premium approach calls
for adding a subjective risk premium of 3 to 5 percentage points to the interest
rate on the firm’s own long-term debt: rs = Bond yield + Judgmental risk
premium.
•
When calculating the cost of new common stock, re, the DCF approach can be
used to estimate the flotation cost. For a constant growth stock, the flotation-
adjusted cost can be expressed as re ¼ ^re ¼ D1=½P0ð1 −FÞ þ g. Note that flotation
costs cause re to be greater than rs. We can find the difference between re and rs
and then add this differential to the CAPM estimate of rs to find the CAPM
estimate of re.
•
Each firm has a target capital structure, which is defined as the mix of debt,
preferred stock, and common equity that minimizes its weighted average cost
of capital (WACC):
WACC ¼ wdrdð1 −TÞ þ wpsrps þ wsrs
We discuss in Chapter 15 how the target weights are determined, but keep in
mind that if you don’t know the target weights, it’s better to calculate WACC
using market value than book value weights.
•
Various factors affect a firm’s cost of capital. Some are determined by the fi-
nancial environment, but the firm can influence others through its financing, in-
vestment, and dividend policies.
•
Many firms estimate divisional costs of capital that reflect each division’s risk
and capital structure.
•
The pure play and accounting beta methods can be used to estimate betas for
large projects or for divisions.
•
A project’s stand-alone risk is the risk the project would have if it were the
firm’s only asset and if stockholders held only that one stock. Stand-alone risk is
measured by the variability of the asset’s expected returns.
•
Corporate, or within-firm, risk reflects the effect of a project on the firm’s risk,
and it is measured by the project’s effect on the firm’s earnings variability.
•
Market, or beta, risk reflects the effects of a project on stockholders’ risk, as-
suming they hold diversified portfolios. Market risk is measured by the project’s
effect on the firm’s beta coefficient.
•
Most decision makers consider all three risk measures in a subjective manner and
then classify projects into risk categories. Using the firm’s WACC as a starting
point, risk-adjusted costs of capital are developed for each category. The risk-
adjusted cost of capital is the cost of capital appropriate for a given project,
given its risk. The greater a project’s risk, the higher its cost of capital.
•
Firms may be able to use the CAPM to estimate the cost of capital for specific
projects or divisions. However, estimating betas for projects is difficult and sub-
jective; hence, project risk adjustments tend to be more subjective than precisely
measured.
The cost of capital as developed in this chapter is used in the next two chapters to
evaluate potential capital budgeting projects, and it is used later in the text to deter-
mine the value of a corporation.

WACC
Longstreet Communications Inc. (LCI) has the following capital structure, which it
considers to be optimal: debt = 25%, preferred stock = 15%, and common stock =
60%. LCI’s tax rate is 40%, and investors expect earnings and dividends to grow at
a constant rate of 6% in the future. LCI paid a dividend of $3.70 per share last year
(D0), and its stock currently sells at a price of $60 per share. Ten-year Treasury
bonds yield 6%, the market risk premium is 5%, and LCI’s beta is 1.3. The following
terms would apply to new security offerings.
Preferred: New preferred could be sold to the public at a price of $100 per share, with
a dividend of $9. Flotation costs of $5 per share would be incurred.
Debt: Debt could be sold at an interest rate of 9%.
Common: New common equity will be raised only by retaining earnings.

The following facts also apply to TII.

payable quarterly. These loans are used to finance receivables and inventories
on a seasonal basis, so bank loans are zero in the off-season.

373

(2) The long-term debt consists of 20-year, semiannual payment mortgage bonds with
a coupon rate of 8%. Currently, these bonds provide a yield to investors of rd =
12%. If new bonds were sold, they would have a 12% yield to maturity.
(3) TII’s perpetual preferred stock has a $100 par value, pays a quarterly dividend
of $2, and has a yield to investors of 11%. New perpetual preferred would have
to provide the same yield to investors, and the company would incur a 5% flo-
tation cost to sell it.
(4) The company has 4 million shares of common stock outstanding. P0 = $20, but
the stock has recently traded in the price range from $17 to $23. D0 = $1 and
EPS0 = $2. ROE based on average equity was 24% in 2008, but management
expects to increase this return on equity to 30%; however, security analysts and
investors generally are not aware of management’s optimism in this regard.
(5) Betas, as reported by security analysts, range from 1.3 to 1.7; the T-bond rate is
10%; and RPM is estimated by various brokerage houses to be in the range
from 4.5% to 5.5%. Some brokerage house analysts report forecasted growth
dividend growth rates in the range of 10% to 15% over the foreseeable future.
(6) TII’s financial vice president recently polled some pension fund investment
managers who hold TII’s securities regarding what minimum rate of return on
TII’s common would make them willing to buy the common rather than TII
bonds, given that the bonds yielded 12%. The responses suggested a risk pre-
mium over TII bonds of 4 to 6 percentage points.
(7) TII is in the 40% federal-plus-state tax bracket.
(8) TII’s principal investment banker predicts a decline in interest rates, with rd
falling to 10% and the T-bond rate to 8%, although the bank acknowledges
that an increase in the expected inflation rate could lead to an increase rather
than a decrease in interest rates.
Assume that you were recently hired by TII as a financial analyst and that
your boss, the treasurer, has asked you to estimate the company’s WACC under
the assumption that no new equity will be issued. Your cost of capital should be
appropriate for use in evaluating projects that are in the same risk class as the
assets TII now operates.

Build a Model: WACC
Start with the partial model in the file Ch09 P18 Build a Model.xls on the textbook’s
Web site. The stock of Gao Computing sells for $50, and last year’s dividend was
$2.10. A flotation cost of 10% would be required to issue new common stock.
Gao’s preferred stock pays a dividend of $3.30 per share, and new preferred could
be sold at a price to net the company $30 per share. Security analysts are projecting
that the common dividend will grow at a rate of 7% a year. The firm can issue addi-
tional long-term debt at an interest rate (or a before-tax cost) of 10%, and its mar-
ginal tax rate is 35%. The market risk premium is 6%, the risk-free rate is 6.5%, and
Gao’s beta is 0.83. In its cost-of-capital calculations, Gao uses a target capital struc-
ture with 45% debt, 5% preferred stock, and 50% common equity.

Calculate the cost of each capital component—in other words, the after-tax cost
of debt, the cost of preferred stock (including flotation costs), and the cost of eq-
uity (ignoring flotation costs). Use both the DCF method and the CAPM
method to find the cost of equity.

Suppose Gao is evaluating three projects with the following characteristics.
(1)
Each project has a cost of $1 million. They will all be financed using the

cost of the common equity for each project should be based on the beta
estimated for the project. All equity will come from reinvested earnings.
(2)
Equity invested in Project A would have a beta of 0.5 and an expected
return of 9.0%.
(3)
Equity invested in Project B would have a beta of 1.0 and an expected
return of 10.0%.

CALCULATING 3M’S COST OF CAPITAL
In this chapter we described how to estimate a company’s WACC, which is the
weighted average of its costs of debt, preferred stock, and common equity. Most
of the data we need to do this can be found in Thomson ONE. Here, we walk
through the steps used to calculate Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing’s (MMM)
WACC.
Thomson ONE—BSE Discussion Questions
1. As a first step we need to estimate what percentage of MMM’s capital comes
from long-term debt, preferred stock, and common equity. If we click on FI-
NANCIALS, we can see immediately from the balance sheet the amount of
MMM’s long-term debt and common equity (as of mid-2008, MMM had no
preferred stock). Alternatively, you can click on FUNDAMENTAL RATIOS in
the next row of tabs below and then select WORLDSCOPE’S BALANCE
SHEET RATIOS. Here, you will also find a recent measure of long-term debt as
a percentage of total capital.
Recall that the weights used in the WACC are based on the company’s target
capital structure. If we assume the company wants to maintain the same mix of
capital that it currently has on its balance sheet, then what weights should you use
to estimate the WACC for MMM? (In Chapter 15, we will see that we might
arrive at different estimates for these weights if we assume that MMM bases its
target capital structure on the market values, rather than the book values, of debt
and equity.)
Chapter 9: The Cost of Capital
375

2. Once again, we can use the CAPM to estimate MMM’s cost of equity. Thomson
ONE provides various estimates of beta; select the measure that you believe is
best and combine this with your estimates of the risk-free rate and the market
risk premium to obtain an estimate of its cost of equity. (See the Thomson ONE
exercise in Chapter 6 for more details.) What is your estimate for the cost of
equity? Why might it not make much sense to use the DCF approach to estimate
MMM’s cost of equity?
3. Next, we need to calculate MMM’s cost of debt. Unfortunately, Thomson ONE
doesn’t provide a direct measure of the cost of debt. However, we can use dif-
ferent approaches to estimate it. One approach is to take the company’s long-
term interest expense and divide it by the amount of long-term debt. This ap-
proach works only if the historical cost of debt equals the yield to maturity in
today’s market (that is, only if MMM’s outstanding bonds are trading at close to
par). This approach may produce misleading estimates in the years during which
MMM issues a significant amount of new debt.
For example, if a company issues a lot of debt at the end of the year, then the
full amount of debt will appear on the year-end balance sheet, yet we still may
not see a sharp increase in interest expense on the annual income statement be-
cause the debt was outstanding for only a small portion of the entire year. When
this situation occurs, the estimated cost of debt will likely understate the true cost
of debt.
Another approach is to try to find this number in the notes to the company’s
annual report by accessing the company’s home page and its Investor Relations
section. Remember that you need the after-tax cost of debt to calculate a firm’s
WACC, so you will need MMM’s average tax rate (which has been about 37% in
recent years). What is your estimate of MMM’s after-tax cost of debt?
4. Putting all this information together, what is your estimate of MMM’s WACC?
How confident are you in this estimate? Explain your answer.
Mini Case
During the last few years, Harry Davis Industries has been too constrained by the high cost of
capital to make many capital investments. Recently, though, capital costs have been declining,
and the company has decided to look seriously at a major expansion program proposed by the
marketing department. Assume that you are an assistant to Leigh Jones, the financial vice
president. Your first task is to estimate Harry Davis’s cost of capital. Jones has provided you
with the following data, which she believes may be relevant to your task:
(1)
The firm’s tax rate is 40%.
(2)
The current price of Harry Davis’s 12% coupon, semiannual payment, noncallable
bonds with 15 years remaining to maturity is $1,153.72. Harry Davis does not use
short-term interest-bearing debt on a permanent basis. New bonds would be privately
placed with no flotation cost.
(3)
The current price of the firm’s 10%, $100 par value, quarterly dividend, perpetual pre-
ferred stock is $116.95. Harry Davis would incur flotation costs equal to 5% of the pro-
ceeds on a new issue.
(4)
Harry Davis’s common stock is currently selling at $50 per share. Its last dividend (D0)
was $3.12, and dividends are expected to grow at a constant rate of 5.8% in the foresee-
able future. Harry Davis’s beta is 1.2, the yield on T-bonds is 5.6%, and the market
risk premium is estimated to be 6%. For the over-own-bond-yield-plus-judgmental-
risk-premium approach, the firm uses a 3.2% risk premium.
376
Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

(5)
Harry Davis’s target capital structure is 30% long-term debt, 10% preferred stock, and
60% common equity.
To help you structure the task, Leigh Jones has asked you to answer the following
questions.
a. (1)
What sources of capital should be included when you estimate Harry Davis’s
weighted average cost of capital?
(2)
Should the component costs be figured on a before-tax or an after-tax basis?
(3)
Should the costs be historical (embedded) costs or new (marginal) costs?
b. What is the market interest rate on Harry Davis’s debt, and what is the component cost
of this debt for WACC purposes?
c. (1)
What is the firm’s cost of preferred stock?
(2)
Harry Davis’s preferred stock is riskier to investors than its debt, yet the prefer-
red’s yield to investors is lower than the yield to maturity on the debt. Does this
suggest that you have made a mistake? (Hint: Think about taxes.)
d. (1)
What are the two primary ways companies raise common equity?
(2)
Why is there a cost associated with reinvested earnings?
(3)
Harry Davis doesn’t plan to issue new shares of common stock. Using the CAPM
approach, what is Harry Davis’s estimated cost of equity?
e. (1)
What is the estimated cost of equity using the discounted cash flow (DCF)
approach?
(2)
Suppose the firm has historically earned 15% on equity (ROE) and has paid out
62% of earnings, and suppose investors expect similar values to obtain in the fu-
ture. How could you use this information to estimate the future dividend growth
rate, and what growth rate would you get? Is this consistent with the 5.8% growth
rate given earlier?
(3)
Could the DCF method be applied if the growth rate were not constant? How?
f. What is the cost of equity based on the over-own-bond- yield-plus-judgmental-risk-
premium method?
g. What is your final estimate for the cost of equity, rs?
h. What is Harry Davis’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC)?
i. What factors influence a company’s WACC?
j. Should the company use the overall, or composite, WACC as the hurdle rate for each
of its divisions?
k. What procedures can be used to estimate the risk-adjusted cost of capital for a particu-
lar division? What approaches are used to measure a division’s beta?
l. Harry Davis is interested in establishing a new division that will focus primarily on de-
veloping new Internet-based projects. In trying to determine the cost of capital for this
new division, you discover that specialized firms involved in similar projects have, on av-
erage, the following characteristics: (1) their capital structure is 10% debt and 90%
common equity; (2) their cost of debt is typically 12%; and (3) they have a beta of 1.7.
Given this information, what would your estimate be for the new division’s cost of
capital?
m. What are three types of project risk? How can each type of risk be considered when
thinking about the new division’s cost of capital?
n. Explain in words why new common stock that is raised externally has a higher percent-
age cost than equity that is raised internally by retaining earnings.
o. (1)
Harry Davis estimates that if it issues new common stock, the flotation cost will be
15%. Harry Davis incorporates the flotation costs into the DCF approach. What is
the estimated cost of newly issued common stock, taking into account the flotation
cost?
(2)
Suppose Harry Davis issues 30-year debt with a par value of $1,000 and a coupon
rate of 10%, paid annually. If flotation costs are 2%, what is the after-tax cost of
debt for the new bond issue?
p. What four common mistakes in estimating the WACC should Harry Davis avoid?

The Basics of Capital
Budgeting: Evaluating
Cash Flows
F
PL Group is a holding company that owns Florida Power & Light,
electric generating plants across the country, the nation’s largest fleet
of wind turbines, and major solar power facilities. It takes up to 10
years to acquire property, obtain the necessary permits, design the plant,
arrange the financing, and complete the construction of a large generating
plant. Moreover, utilities like FPL are required by law to have electricity
available when it is demanded—when people turn on the switch, the
utility must have the energy its customers expect or suffer severe fines
and other penalties. Thus, FPL must forecast power usage many years in
advance and make plans for meeting that demand.
Making a 10-year forecast is always difficult, but the 2008–2009
recession increased this difficulty tremendously. The two most important
sectors of Florida’s economy are housing and tourism. In 2009 the state
had a huge supply of unsold houses and was second only to California in
foreclosures, which was driving home prices down and vacancies up. Also,
the bad economy was hurting the tourism industry. No one could know
when those two industries—and the retail businesses that depend on
them—would start to improve. That means no one could accurately
forecast electricity usage or, thus, the need for new generating capacity.
Before the economy started downhill, FPL had developed a detailed
capital budget for 2009–2011. But as the economy began to decline, its
managers had many long, hard meetings to consider modifications. On
the one hand, FPL’s managers wanted to keep construction on track—it’s
costly to start and stop large projects because large cancellation fees are
imposed if contracts are canceled. Moreover, FPL wanted to move ahead
with its wind and solar programs and thus provide more “green” energy.
On the other hand, the capital markets were drying up, making it difficult
and expensive to acquire the funds FPL needed to finance its capital
budget. Even worse, if it charged ahead and completed plants for which
there was no demand, then it was possible that interest, depreciation, and
maintenance costs could literally drive the company to bankruptcy.
379

In the end, management compromised—they cut back on the projects
that were easiest to defer but went ahead with those for which deferrals
would be most costly. The 2009 capital budget was reduced from $7.0
billion to $5.3 billion. Of the $1.7 billion reduction, $1.3 billion was related
to wind farms, solar, and other “green” projects. FPL’s actions, and similar
ones by other utilities across the country, have had effects on the
manufacturers of windmills, solar panels, and related products. Those
firms have laid off workers, cut back R&D, and in some cases simply
gone out of business.
The FPL story is typical, and it illustrates that capital budgeting is
critically important both to companies and to the economy. The principles
set forth in this chapter will help you make the right choices regarding
which projects to accept and which to reject.

Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

In Chapter 10 and Chapter 11 we discuss capital budgeting. Here capital refers to long-
term assets used in production, and a budget is a plan that outlines projected expenditures
during a future period. Thus, the capital budget is a summary of planned investments
of assets that will last for more than a year, and capital budgeting is the whole process
of analyzing projects and deciding which ones to accept and thus include in the capital
budget. Chapter 10 focuses on the basics of capital budgeting, especially the primary cri-
teria used to evaluate projects, and it explains why one method—the net present value
(NPV)—is the best single criterion. We use simplified examples in this chapter to ex-
plain the basic theory and then, in Chapter 11, we go on to discuss how cash flows are
estimated, how risk is measured, and how capital budgeting decisions are actually made.
10.1 AN OVERVIEW OF CAPITAL BUDGETING
Capital budgeting is based on the same procedures that are used in security valuation,
but with two major differences. First, stocks and bonds exist in the securities markets
and investors choose from the available set. However, firms actually create capital bud-
geting projects, so capital budgeting involves project creation. Second, most investors
have no influence over the cash flows produced by their investments, whereas corpora-
tions do have a major influence on their projects’ results. If companies execute their
plans well, then capital budgeting projects will be successful, but poor execution will
lead to project failures. Still, in both security analysis and capital budgeting, we forecast
Corporate Valuation and Capital Budgeting
You can calculate the cash flows (CF) for a project in much
the same way as for a firm. When the project’s cash flows
are discounted at the appropriate risk-adjusted weighted
average cost of capital (“r” for simplicity), the result is the
project’s value. Note that when valuing an entire firm we
discount its free cash flows at the overall weighted aver-
age cost of capital, but when valuing a project we discount
its cash flows at the project’s own risk-adjusted cost of
capital. Note also that the firm’s free cash flows are the
total of all the net cash flows from its past projects. Thus,
if a project is accepted and put into operation, it will pro-
vide cash flows that add to the firm’s free cash flows and
thus to the firm’s value.
Subtracting the initial cost of the project from the dis-
counted cash flows gives the project’s net present value
(NPV). A project that has a positive NPV adds value to the
firm. In fact, the firm’s Market Value Added (MVA) is the
sum of all its projects’ NPVs. The key point, though, is that
the process of evaluating projects, or capital budgeting, is
absolutely critical for a firm’s success.

a set of cash flows, find the present value of those flows, and then make the investment if
and only if the PV of the future expected cash flows exceeds the investment’s cost.
A firm’s growth, and even its ability to remain competitive and to survive, depends
on a constant flow of ideas for new products, improvements in existing products, and
ways to operate more efficiently. Accordingly, well-managed firms go to great
lengths to develop good capital budgeting proposals. For example, the executive vice
president of one successful corporation told us that his company takes the following
steps to generate projects.
Our R&D department constantly searches for new products and ways to improve existing pro-
ducts. In addition, our Executive Committee, which consists of senior executives in marketing,
production, and finance, identifies the products and markets in which our company should com-
pete, and the Committee sets long-run targets for each division. These targets, which are spelled
out in the corporation’s strategic business plan, provide a general guide to the operating executives
who must meet them. The operating executives then seek new products, set expansion plans for
existing products, and look for ways to reduce production and distribution costs. Since bonuses
and promotions are based on each unit’s ability to meet or exceed its targets, these economic incen-
tives encourage our operating managers to seek out profitable investment opportunities.
While our senior executives are judged and rewarded on the basis of how well their units
perform, people further down the line are given bonuses and stock options for suggestions that
lead to profitable investments. Additionally, a percentage of our corporate profit is set aside for
distribution to nonexecutive employees, and we have an Employees’ Stock Ownership Plan
(ESOP) to provide further incentives. Our objective is to encourage employees at all levels to
keep an eye out for good ideas, especially those that lead to capital investments.
Analyzing capital expenditure proposals is not costless—benefits can be gained, but anal-
ysis does have a cost. For certain types of projects, an extremely detailed analysis may be
warranted, whereas simpler procedures are adequate for other projects. Accordingly, firms
generally categorize projects and analyze those in each category somewhat differently:
1. Replacement needed to continue profitable operations. An example would be an essen-
tial pump on a profitable offshore oil platform. The platform manager could
make this investment without an elaborate review process.
2. Replacement to reduce costs. An example would be the replacement of serviceable
but obsolete equipment in order to lower costs. A fairly detailed analysis would
be needed, with more detail required for larger expenditures.
3. Expansion of existing products or markets. These decisions require a forecast of
growth in demand, so a more detailed analysis is required. Go/no-go decisions
are generally made at a higher level than are replacement decisions.
4. Expansion into new products or markets. These investments involve strategic decisions
that could change the fundamental nature of the business. A detailed analysis is re-
quired, and the final decision is made by top officers, possibly with board approval.
5. Contraction decisions. Especially during bad recessions, companies often find
themselves with more capacity than they are likely to need in the foreseeable
future. Then, rather than continue to operate plants at, say, 50% of capacity and
incur losses as a result of excessive fixed costs, they decide to downsize. That
generally requires payments to laid off workers and additional costs for shutting
down selected operations. These decisions are made at the board level.
6. Safety and/or environmental projects. Expenditures necessary to comply with envi-
ronmental orders, labor agreements, or insurance policy terms fall into this category.
How these projects are handled depends on their size, with small ones being treated
much like the Category 1 projects and large ones requiring expenditures that might
even cause the firm to abandon the line of business.
382
Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

7. Other. This catch-all includes items such as office buildings, parking lots, and
executive aircraft. How they are handled varies among companies.
8. Mergers. Buying a whole firm (or division) is different from buying a machine or
building a new plant. Still, basic capital budgeting procedures are used when
making merger decisions.
Relatively simple calculations, and only a few supporting documents, are required for
most replacement decisions, especially maintenance investments in profitable plants.
More detailed analyses are required as we move on to more complex expansion deci-
sions, especially for investments in new products or areas. Also, within each category
projects are grouped by their dollar costs: Larger investments require increasingly de-
tailed analysis and approval at higher levels. Thus, a plant manager might be authorized
to approve maintenance expenditures up to $10,000 using a simple payback analysis, but
the full board of directors might have to approve decisions that involve either amounts
greater than $1 million or expansions into new products or markets.
If a firm has capable and imaginative executives and employees, and if its incentive
system is working properly, then many ideas for capital investment will be forthcom-
ing. Some ideas will be good and should be funded, but others should be killed.
Therefore, the following procedures have been established for screening projects
and deciding which to accept or reject:1
1. Net Present Value (NPV)
2. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
3. Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR)
4. Profitability Index (PI)
5. Regular Payback
6. Discounted Payback
As we shall see, the NPV is the best single criterion, primarily because it is directly related
to the firm’s central goal of maximizing the stock’s intrinsic value. However, all of the
methods provide some useful information, and all are used in practice.

10.2 NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV)
The net present value (NPV), defined as the present value of a project’s cash in-
flows minus the present value of its costs, tells us how much the project contributes
to shareholder wealth—the larger the NPV, the more value the project adds and thus
the higher the stock’s price. NPV is generally regarded as the best single screening
criterion. We use the data for Projects S and L shown in Figure 10-1 to illustrate the
calculations for the NPV and the other criteria. The S stands for Short and the L for
Long: Project S is a short-term project in the sense that most of its cash inflows come
in relatively soon; Project L has more total cash inflows, but most are realized in the
later years.
1One other rarely used criterion, the Accounting Rate of Return, is covered in the chapter’s Excel
Tool Kit model and Web Extension 10A.
Chapter 10: The Basics of Capital Budgeting: Evaluating Cash Flows
383

The projects are equally risky, and they both have a 10% cost of capital. Further-
more, the cash flows have been adjusted to incorporate the impact of depreciation,
taxes, and salvage values.2 The investment outlays are shown under Year 0, and they
include investments in fixed assets and any necessary working capital. All subsequent
cash flows occur at the end of the year. All of the calculations can be done easily with
a financial calculator, but since capital budgeting in the real world is generally done
using a spreadsheet, we show how problems would be set up in Excel.
We can find the NPVs as follows.
1. Calculate the present value of each cash flow discounted at the project’s risk-
adjusted cost of capital, which is r = 10% in our example.
2. The sum of the discounted cash flows is defined as the project’s NPV.
The equation for the NPV, set up with input data for Project S, is

2So that we can focus on the capital budgeting decision criteria, we provide the cash flows for each
project in this chapter. However, the most difficult aspect of capital budgeting is estimating the “relevant”
cash flows, which are defined as the cash flows generated by the project that are available for distribution
to investors. In other words, they are the project’s free cash flows. Cash flow estimation is simple
conceptually but difficult in practice, so we defer its discussion to Chapter 11.

Applying Equation 10-1 to Project S, we have
NPVS ¼ −$10;000 þ $5;000

¼ $788:20
Here CFt is the expected net cash flow at Time t, r is the project’s risk-adjusted cost of
capital (or WACC), and N is its life. Projects generally require an initial investment—
for example, developing the product, buying the equipment needed to make it, building
a factory, and stocking inventory. The initial investment is a negative cash flow. For
Projects S and L, only CF0 is negative, but for a large project such as an FPL power
plant, outflows would occur for several years before cash inflows begin.
Figure 10-2 shows, on Row 59, the cash flow time line for project S as taken from
Figure 10-1. The cost is −$10,000, which is not discounted because it occurs at t = 0.
The PV of each cash inflow, and the sum of the PVs, is shown in Column B. You
could find the PVs of the cash flows with a calculator or with Excel, and the end re-
sult would be the numbers in Column B of the figure. When we sum the PVs of the
inflows and subtract the cost, the result is $788.20, which is NPVS. The NPV for
Project L, $1,004.03, can be found similarly.
The step-by-step procedure shown for Project S is useful for illustrating how the
NPV is calculated, but in practice (and on exams) it is far more efficient to use a finan-
cial calculator or Excel.Different calculators are set up somewhat differently, but (as we
discussed in Chapter 4) they all have a “cash flow register” that can be used to evaluate
uneven cash flows such as those for Projects S and L. Equation 10-1 is actually pro-
grammed into these calculators, and all we need to do is enter the cash flows (with
the correct signs) along with r = I/YR = 10. Once the data have been entered, you
can press the NPV key to get the answer, 788.20, on the screen.3

385

If you are familiar with Excel, you can use it to find the NPVs for S and L:
NPVS ¼ $788:20
NPVL ¼ $1;004:03
We provide the model used to obtain these values in the chapter’s Excel Tool Kit. If
you are familiar with Excel then you should look at the model, as this is how most
people in the real world deal with capital budgeting problems.
Before using these NPVs in the decision process, we need to know whether
Projects S and L are independent or mutually exclusive. Independent projects
are those whose cash flows are not affected by other projects. If Wal-Mart were
considering a new store in Boise and another in Atlanta, those projects would be
independent, and if both had positive NPVs, Wal-Mart should accept both. Mutu-
ally exclusive projects, on the other hand, are two different ways of accomplishing
the same result, so if one project is accepted then the other must be rejected. A
conveyor-belt system to move goods in a warehouse and a fleet of forklifts for
the same purpose would be mutually exclusive—accepting one implies rejecting
the other.
What should the decision be if Projects S and L are independent? In this case,
both should be accepted because both have positive NPVs and thus add value to the
firm. However, if they are mutually exclusive, then Project L should be chosen be-
cause it has the higher NPV and thus adds more value than S. We can summarize
these criteria with the following rules.
NPV Decision Rules
Independent projects: If NPV exceeds zero, accept the project. Since S and L both have
positive NPVs, accept them both if they are independent.
Mutually exclusive projects: Accept the project with the highest positive NPV. If no
project has a positive NPV, then reject them all. If S and L are mutually exclusive,
the NPV criterion would select L.
Projects must be either independent or mutually exclusive, so one or the other of
these rules applies to every project.4

(a) independent or (b) mutually exclusive? (Both; LL)
4This is a simplification. For example, some projects can benefit others—these are “complementary”
projects. Other projects harm others—these are called “cannibalizing” projects. These concepts are
addressed in Chapter 11.

Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

10.3 INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN (IRR)
In Chapter 5 we discussed the yield to maturity on a bond, and we explained that if you
hold a bond to maturity then you will earn the yield to maturity on your investment.
The YTM is found as the discount rate that forces the present value of the cash inflows
to equal the price of the bond. This same concept is used in capital budgeting when we
calculate a project’s internal rate of return, or IRR:
A project’s IRR is the discount rate that forces the PV of the inflows to equal the initial
cost (or to equal the PVs of all the costs if costs are incurred over several years). This is equiv-
alent to forcing the NPV to equal zero. The IRR is an estimate of the project’s rate of return,
and it is comparable to the YTM on a bond.
To calculate the IRR, we begin with Equation 10-1 for the NPV, replace r in the
denominator with the term “IRR,” and set the NPV equal to zero. This transforms
Equation 10-1 into Equation 10-2, the one used to find the IRR. The rate that forces
NPV to equal zero is the IRR.5

Chapter 10: The Basics of Capital Budgeting: Evaluating Cash Flows
387

Three procedures can be used to find the IRR:
1. Trial-and-error. We could use a trial-and-error procedure: try a discount rate, see
if the equation solves to zero, and if it doesn’t, try a different rate. We could then
continue until we found the rate that forces the NPV to zero, and that rate would
be the IRR. For Project S the IRR is 14.489%. Note, though, that the trial-
and-error procedure is so time-consuming that—before computers and financial
calculators were available—the IRR was almost never calculated. It’s useful to
think about the trial-and-error procedure, but it’s far better to use either a cal-
culator or Excel for the actual calculations.
2. Calculator solution. Enter the cash flows into the calculator’s cash flow register
just as we did to find the NPV, and then press the calculator key labeled “IRR.”
Instantly, you get the internal rate of return. Here are the values for Projects S
and L:6
IRRS ¼ 14:489%
IRRL ¼ 13:549%
3. Excel solution. It is even easier to find IRRs using Excel, as we demonstrate in this
chapter’s Tool Kit.7
Why is the discount rate that causes a project’s NPV to equal zero so special? The
reason is that the IRR is an estimate of the project’s rate of return. If this return ex-
ceeds the cost of the funds used to finance the project, then the difference is a bonus
that goes to the firm’s stockholders and causes the stock’s price to rise. Project S has
an estimated return of 14.489% versus a 10% cost of capital, so its bonus is 4.489%.
On the other hand, if the IRR is less than the cost of capital then stockholders must
make up the shortfall, which would hurt the stock price.
Note again that the IRR formula, Equation 10-2, is simply the NPV formula,
Equation 10-1, solved for the particular discount rate that forces the NPV to zero.
Thus, the same basic equation is used for both methods. The only difference is that with
the NPV method, the discount rate is given and we find the NPV, whereas with the IRR
method, the NPV is set equal to zero and we find the interest rate that provides this
equality.
If the IRR criterion is used to rank projects, then the decision rules are as follows.
Independent projects: If IRR exceeds the project’s WACC, then the project should be
accepted. If IRR is less than the project’s WACC, reject it. Projects S and L both
have positive IRRs, so they would both be accepted by the IRR method. Note that
both projects were also accepted by the NPV criterion, so the NPV and IRR cri-
teria provide the same result if the projects are independent.
Mutually exclusive projects. Accept the mutually exclusive project with the highest
IRR, provided that the project’s IRR is greater than its WACC. Reject any
6See our calculator tutorials on the textbook’s Web site. Note that once the cash flows have been entered
into the cash flow register, you can find both the NPV and the IRR. To find the NPV, enter the interest
rate (I/YR) and then press the NPV key. Then, with no further entries, press the IRR key to find the
IRR. Thus, once you set up the calculator to find the NPV, it is easy to find the IRR. This is one reason
most firms calculate both the NPV and the IRR. If you calculate one, it is easy to also calculate the other,
and both provide information that decision makers find useful. The same is true with Excel: after estimat-
ing cash flows, it is easy to calculate both NPV and IRR.
7Note that to calculate the IRR with Excel the full data range is specified, because Excel’s IRR function as-
sumes that the first cash flow (the negative $10,000) occurs at t = 0. You can use the function wizard if
you don’t have the formula memorized.

Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

project whose best IRR does not exceed the firm’s WACC. Since Project S has
the higher IRR, it should be accepted (and L rejected) if the projects are mu-
tually exclusive. However, recall that Project L had the larger NPV, so the
NPV method ranked L over S and thus would choose L. Therefore, a conflict
will exist between the NPV and the IRR criteria if the projects are mutually
exclusive.
The IRR is logically appealing—it is useful to know the rates of return on pro-
posed investments. However, as we see from Projects L and S, NPV and IRR can
produce conflicting conclusions when one is choosing between mutually exclusive
projects, and when conflicts occur the NPV criterion is generally better.

Why NPV Is Better Than IRR
Buffett University recently hosted a seminar on business
methods for managers. A finance professor covered capi-
tal budgeting, explaining how to calculate the NPV, and
stated that it should be used to screen potential projects.
In the Q-and-A session, Ed Wilson, treasurer of an elec-
tronics firm, said his firm used the IRR primarily because
the CFO and the directors understood about selecting pro-
jects based on their rates of return but didn’t under-
stand the NPV. Ed had tried to explain why the NPV
was better, but it simply confused his bosses, so the
company stuck with the IRR. Now a meeting on the
firm’s capital budget is coming up, and Ed asked the
professor for a simple, easy-to-understand explanation
of why the NPV is better.
The professor recommended the following extreme
example. A firm with adequate access to capital and a
10% WACC is choosing between two equally risky, mu-
tually exclusive projects. Project Large calls for invest-
ing $100,000 and then receiving $50,000 per year for 10
years, while Project Small calls for investing $1 and
then receiving $0.60 per year for 10 years. Here are
the two project’s NPVs and IRRs:
Project Large
Project Small
NPVL : $207,228.36
NPVS :
$2.69
IRRL :
49.1%
IRRS :
59.4%
The IRR says choose S, but the NPV says accept L. Intu-
itively, it’s obvious that the firm would be better off
choosing the large project in spite of its lower IRR.
With a cost of capital of only 10%, a 49% rate of return
on a $100,000 investment is much more profitable than
a 59% return on a $1 investment.
When Ed gave this example in his firm’s executive
meeting on the capital budget, the CFO argued that
this example was extreme and unrealistic, and no one
would choose S in spite of its higher IRR. Ed agreed, but
he asked the CFO where the line should be drawn
between realistic and unrealistic examples. When he
received no answer, he went on to say that (1) it’s hard
to draw this line, and (2) the NPV is always better
because it tells us how much each project will add to
the firm’s value. The president was listening, and he
declared Ed the winner. The company switched from
IRR to NPV, and Ed is now the CFO.
Chapter 10: The Basics of Capital Budgeting: Evaluating Cash Flows
389

10.4 MULTIPLE INTERNAL RATES OF RETURN8
One problem with the IRR is that, under certain conditions, a project may have more
than one IRR. First, note that a project is said to have normal cash flows if it has one
or more cash outflows (costs) followed by a series of cash inflows. If, however, a cash
outflow occurs sometime after the inflows have started, meaning that the signs of the
cash flows change more than once, then the project is said to have nonnormal cash
flows. Here’s an illustration of these concepts:
Normal:
−+ + + + + or −−−+ + + + +
Nonnormal: −+ + + + −or −+ + + −+ + +
An example of a project with nonnormal flows would be a strip coal mine where the
company first spends money to buy the property and prepare the site for mining,
has positive inflows for several years, and then spends more money to return the
land to its original condition. In this case, the project might have two IRRs—that
is, multiple IRRs.9
To illustrate multiple IRRs, suppose a firm is considering a potential strip mine
(Project M) that has a cost of $1.6 million, will produce a cash flow of $10 million
at the end of Year 1; then, at the end of Year 2, the firm must spend $10 million to
restore the land to its original condition. Therefore, the project’s expected net cash
flows are as follows (in millions):
Year 0
End of Year 1
End of Year 2
Cash flows
−$1.6
+$10
−$10
We can substitute these values into Equation 10-2 and then solve for the IRR:
NPV ¼ −$1:6 million
ð1 þ IRRÞ0
þ $10 million
ð1 þ IRRÞ1 þ −$10 million
ð1 þ IRRÞ2 ¼ 0
Here the NPV equals 0 when IRR = 25%, but it also equals 0 when IRR = 400%.10
Therefore, Project M has one IRR of 25% and another of 400%, and we don’t know
which one to use. This relationship is depicted graphically in Figure 10-4.11 The graph
is constructed by plotting the project’s NPV at different discount rates.
Observe that no dilemma regarding Project M would arise if the NPV method
were used; we would simply find the NPV at the appropriate cost of capital and use
it to evaluate the project. We would see that if Project M’s cost of capital were 10%
then its NPV would be −$0.774 million and the project should be rejected. If r were
between 25% and 400% then the NPV would be positive, but any such number

9Equation 10-2 is a polynomial of degree n, so it has n different roots, or solutions. All except one of the
roots is an imaginary number when investments have normal cash flows (one or more cash outflows fol-
lowed by cash inflows), so in the normal case only one value of IRR appears. However, the possibility of
multiple real roots, and hence of multiple IRRs, arises when negative net cash flows occur after the proj-
ect has been placed in operation.

10If you attempt to find Project M’s IRR with an HP calculator, you will get an error message, whereas
TI calculators give only the IRR that’s closest to zero. When you encounter either situation, you can
find the approximate IRRs by first calculating NPVs using several different values for r = I/YR, construct-
ing a graph with NPV on the vertical axis and cost of capital on the horizontal axis, and then visually
determining approximately where NPV = 0. The intersection with the x-axis gives a rough idea of the
IRRs’ values. With some calculators and also with Excel, you can find both IRRs by entering guesses, as
we explain in our calculator and Excel tutorials.

the firm’s typical projects would have negative NPVs.)

10.5 REINVESTMENT RATE ASSUMPTIONS12
The NPV calculation is based on the assumption that cash inflows can be reinvested
at the project’s risk-adjusted WACC, whereas the IRR calculation is based on the
assumption that cash flows can be reinvested at the IRR itself. To see why this is so,
think about the following diagram, first used in Chapter 4 to illustrate the future
value of $100 when the interest rate is 5%:
Going from PV to FV: PV = $100.00
2
0
1
5%
5%
5%
3
$105.00
$110.25
$115.76 = FV
Observe that the FV calculation assumes that the interest earned during each year
can itself be reinvested to earn the same 5% in each succeeding year.
Now recall that to find the PV we reversed the process, discounting rather than com-
pounding at the 5% rate. The following diagram can be used to demonstrate this point:
Going from FV to PV: PV = $100.00
2
0
1
5%
5%

3
$105.00
$110.25
$115.76 = FV
We are thus led to the following conclusion: When we calculate a present value, we are
implicitly assuming that cash flows can be reinvested at a specified interest rate (5% in our
example). This applies to Projects S and L: When we calculated their NPVs, we dis-
counted at their WACC of 10%, which means that we assumed that their cash flows
could be reinvested at 10%.
Now consider the IRR. In Section 10.3 we presented a cash flow diagram set up to
show the PVs of the cash flows when discounted at the IRR. We saw that the sum of
the PVs is equal to the cost at a discount rate of 14.489%, so by definition 14.489% is
the IRR. Now we can ask this question: What reinvestment rate is built into the IRR?
Because discounting at a given rate assumes that cash flows can be reinvested at that same
rate, the IRR assumes that cash flows are reinvested at the IRR itself.
So the NPV assumes reinvestment at the WACC whereas the IRR assumes reinvest-
ment at the IRR itself. Which assumption is more reasonable? For most firms, as-
suming reinvestment at the WACC is better, for the following reasons.
•
If a firm has reasonably good access to the capital markets then it can raise all the
capital it needs at the going rate, which in our example is 10%.
•
Since the firm can obtain capital at 10%, if it has investment opportunities
with positive NPVs then it should take them on, and it can finance them at a
10% cost.
•
If we assume that the firm operates in a reasonably competitive industry, then its
return on investment opportunities should be relatively close to its cost of capi-
tal; if it were much higher, then new firms would enter the market and drive
prices (and thus returns) down to near the cost of capital.
•
If the firm uses internally generated cash flows from past projects rather than
external capital, this will simply save it the 10% cost of capital. Thus, 10% is
the opportunity cost of the cash flows, and that is the effective return on rein-
vested funds.
12This section gives a theoretical explanation of the key difference between NPV and IRR. However, it is
relatively technical, so if time is a constraint then professors may decide to have students skip it and just
read the box “Why NPV Is Better Than IRR.”
392
Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

As an illustration, suppose a project’s IRR is 50%, the firm’s WACC is 10%, and
it has good access to the capital markets and operates in a competitive industry.
Thus, the firm can raise all the capital it needs at the 10% rate. Given the existence
of competition, the 50% return would attract new entry, which would make it hard
to find new projects with a similar high return, which is what the IRR assumes.
Moreover, even if the firm does find such projects, it would take them on with exter-
nal capital that costs 10%. The logical conclusion is that the original project’s cash
flows will simply save the 10% cost of the external capital and that 10%, not 50%, is
the effective return on those flows.
If a firm does not have good access to external capital, and if it also has a lot of
potential projects with high IRRs, then it might be reasonable to assume that a pro-
ject’s cash flows could be reinvested at rates close to their IRRs. However, that situa-
tion rarely occurs, since firms with good investment opportunities generally do have
good access to debt and equity markets.
Our conclusion is that the assumption built into the IRR—that cash flows
can be reinvested at the IRR, no matter how high it is—is flawed, whereas the
assumption built into the NPV—that cash flows can be reinvested at the
WACC—is generally correct. Moreover, if the true reinvestment rate is less
than the IRR, then the true rate of return on the investment must be less than
the calculated IRR; thus the IRR is misleading as a measure of a project’s profit-
ability. This point is discussed further in the next section.
Self-Test
Why is a reinvestment rate implicitly assumed whenever we find the present value
of a future cash flow? Would it be possible to find the PV of a FV without specifying
an implicit reinvestment rate?
What reinvestment rate is built into the NPV calculation? The IRR calculation?
For a firm that has adequate access to capital markets, is it more reasonable to
assume reinvestment at the WACC or the IRR? Why?
10.6 MODIFIED INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN (MIRR)13
It is logical for managers to want to know the expected rate of return on invest-
ments, and this is what the IRR is supposed to tell us. However, the IRR is based
on the assumption that projects’ cash flows can be reinvested at the IRR itself, and
this assumption is usually wrong: The IRR overstates the expected return for accepted
projects because cash flows cannot generally be reinvested at the IRR itself. Therefore,
the IRR for accepted projects is generally greater than the true expected rate of
return. This imparts an upward bias on corporate projections based on IRRs.
Given this fundamental flaw, is there a percentage evaluator that is better than
the regular IRR? The answer is “yes”: We can modify the IRR to make it a better
measure of profitability.
This new measure, the Modified IRR (MIRR), is illustrated for Project S in
Figure 10-5. It is similar to the regular IRR, except it is based on the assumption
that cash flows are reinvested at the WACC (or some other explicit rate if that is
a more reasonable assumption). Refer to Figure 10-5 as you read about the con-
struction of this measure.

1. Project S has just one outflow, a negative $10,000 at t = 0. Since it occurs at Time
0, it is not discounted, and its PV is −$10,000. If the project had additional out-
flows, we would find the PV at t = 0 for each one and then sum them for use in
the MIRR calculation.
2. Next, we find the future value of each inflow, compounded at the WACC out to
the “terminal year,” which is the year the last inflow is received. We assume
that cash flows are reinvested at the WACC. For Project S, the first cash flow,
$5,000, is compounded at WACC = 10% for 3 years, and it grows to $6,655.00.
The second inflow, $4,000, grows to $4,840.00, and the third inflow, $3,000,
grows to $3,300.00. The last inflow, $1,000, is received at the end, so it is not
compounded at all. The sum of the future values, $15,795.00, is called the
“terminal value,” or TV.
3. We now have the cost at t = 0, −$10,000, and the TV at Year 4, $15,795.00.
There is some discount rate that will cause the PV of the terminal value to equal
the cost. That interest rate is defined as the Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR).
In a calculator, enter N = 4, PV = −10000, PMT = 0, and FV = 15795.00. Then
pressing the I/YR key yields the MIRR, 12.11%.
4. The MIRR can be found in a number of ways. Figure 10-5 illustrates exactly how
the MIRR is calculated: We compound each cash inflow, sum them to determine the
TV, and then find the rate that causes the PV of the TV to equal the cost. That rate
in this example is 12.11%. However, Excel and some of the better calculators have a
built-in MIRR function that streamlines the process. We explain how to use the

a calculator or Excel.

If S and L are independent, then both should be accepted because both MIRRs exceed the cost of capital. If the
projects are mutually exclusive, then L should be chosen because it has the higher MIRR.

Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

MIRR function in our calculator tutorials, and we explain how to find MIRR with
Excel in this chapter’s Excel model.14
The MIRR has two significant advantages over the regular IRR. First, whereas the
regular IRR assumes that the cash flows from each project are reinvested at the IRR
itself, the MIRR assumes that cash flows are reinvested at the cost of capital (or some
other explicit rate). Since reinvestment at the IRR is generally not correct, the MIRR is
usually a better indicator of a project’s true profitability. Second, the MIRR eliminates
the multiple IRR problem—there can never be more than one MIRR, and it can be
compared with the cost of capital when deciding to accept or reject projects.
Our conclusion is that the MIRR is better than the regular IRR; however, this
question remains: Is MIRR as good as the NPV? Here is our take on the situation.
•
For independent projects, the NPV, IRR, and MIRR always reach the same
accept–reject conclusion, so the three criteria are equally good when evaluating
independent projects.
•
However, if projects are mutually exclusive and if they differ in size, conflicts can arise.
In such cases the NPV is best because it selects the project that maximizes value.15
•
Our overall conclusions are that (1) the MIRR is superior to the regular IRR as an
indicator of a project’s “true” rate of return, but (2) NPV is better than either IRR
or MIRR when choosing among competing projects. If managers want to know the
expected rates of return on projects, it would be better to give them MIRRs rather
than IRRs because MIRRs are more likely to be the rates that are actually earned.

Also, note that there are alternative definitions for the MIRR. One difference relates to whether negative
cash flows after the positive cash flows begin should be compounded and treated as part of the TV or dis-
counted and treated as a cost. A related issue is whether negative and positive flows in a given year should
be netted or treated separately. For more discussion, see David M. Shull, “Interpreting Rates of Return:
A Modified Rate of Return Approach,” Financial Practice and Education, Fall 1993, pp. 67–71.
15For projects of equal size but different lives, the MIRR will always lead to the same decision as the
NPV if the MIRRs are both calculated using as the terminal year the life of the longer project. (Just fill
in zeros for the shorter project’s missing cash flows.)

10.7 NPV PROFILES
Figure 10-6 shows the net present value profile for Project S. To make the profile,
we find the project’s NPV at a number of different discount rates and then plot
those values to create a graph. Note that, at a zero cost of capital, the NPV is simply
the net total of the undiscounted cash flows: $13,000 −$10,000 = $3,000. This value
is plotted as the vertical axis intercept. Also, recall that the IRR is the discount rate
that causes the NPV to equal zero, so the discount rate at which the profile line
crosses the horizontal axis is the project’s IRR. When we connect all the data points,
we have the NPV profile.16

ect cost, as the discount rate increases toward infinity. The reason is that, at an infinitely high cost of cap-
ital, the PVs of the inflows would all be zero, so NPV at r = ∞must be CF0. We should also remark that
under certain conditions the NPV profiles can cross the horizontal axis several times, or never cross it.
This point was discussed in Section 10.4.

Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

Now consider Figure 10-7, which shows two NPV profiles: the one for Project S, as
developed in Figure 10-6, and a new one for L. Note the following points.
•
The NPVs vary depending on the actual cost of capital—the higher the cost of
capital, the lower the NPV. Observe also that L’s NPV declines faster than does
S’s with increases in the cost of capital.
•
However, the IRRs are fixed, and S has the higher IRR regardless of the cost of capital.
•
The two NPV profile lines cross at a cost of capital of 11.975%, which is called
the crossover rate. The crossover rate can be found by calculating the IRR of
the differences in the projects’ cash flows, as demonstrated below:

Project L has the higher NPV if the cost of capital is less than the crossover rate,
but S has the higher NPV if the cost of capital is greater than that rate.
Notice that Project L has the steeper slope, indicating that a given increase in the
cost of capital causes a larger decline in NPVL than in NPVS. To see why this is so,
recall the equation for the NPV:
NPV ¼ CF0 þ
CF1
ð1 þ rÞ1 þ
CF2
ð1 þ rÞ2 þ … þ
CFN
ð1 þ rÞN
Now recognize (1) that L’s cash flows come in later than those of S, with L’s highest
cash flows coming where N is large, and (2) that the impact of an increase in the dis-
count rate is much greater on distant than on near-term cash flows. We demonstrate
the second point below.
Effect of doubling r on a Year-1 cash flow
PV of $100 due in 1 year at r ¼ 5%: $100
ð1:05Þ1 ¼ $95:24
PV of $100 due in 1 year at r ¼ 10%: $100
ð1:10Þ1 ¼ $90:91
Percentage decline due to doubling r ¼ $95:24 −$90:91
$95:24

Effect of doubling r on a Year-20 cash flow
PV of $100 due in 20 years at r ¼ 5%: ¼
$100
ð1:05Þ20 ¼ $37:69
PV of $100 due in 20 years at r ¼ 10%: ¼
$100
ð1:10Þ20 ¼ $14:86
Percentage decline due to doubling r ¼ $37:69 −$14:86
$37:69
¼ 60:6%
Thus, a doubling of the discount rate results in only a 4.5% decline in the PV of a
Year-1 cash flow, but the same increase in discount rate causes the PV of a Year-20
cash flow to fall by more than 60%. Therefore, a project like L, which has most of its
cash flows coming in the later years, will suffer a sharp decline in its NPV if the cost of capi-
tal increases; but a project like S, whose cash flows come earlier, will not be severely penalized.
This is why Project L’s NPV profile has the steeper slope.
As we have seen, Projects S and L have conflicting rankings when ranked by the
NPV versus the IRR. Figure 10-7 can be used to see the conditions under which
such conflicts can and cannot arise.
Independent Projects.
If an independent project with normal cash flows is being evalu-
ated, then the NPV and IRR criteria always lead to the same accept/reject decision: If NPV
says accept then IRR also says accept, and vice versa. To see why this is so, look back at
398
Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

Figure 10-6 and notice (1) that the IRR says accept Project S if the cost of capital is
less than (or to the left of) the IRR and (2) that if the cost of capital is less than the
IRR then the NPV must be positive. Thus, at any cost of capital less than 14.489%,
Project S will be recommended by both the NPV and IRR criteria, but both methods
reject the project if the cost of capital is greater than 14.489%. A similar graph could
be created for Project L or any other normal project, and we would always reach the
same conclusion: For normal, independent projects, if the IRR says to accept it, then so will
the NPV.
Mutually Exclusive Projects.
Now assume that Projects S and L are mutually
exclusive rather than independent. Therefore, we can choose either S or L, or we
can reject both, but we can’t accept both. Now look at Figure 10-7 and note
these points.
•
As long as the cost of capital is greater than the crossover rate of 11.975%, both
methods agree that Project S is better: NPVS > NPVL and IRRS > IRRL.
Therefore, if r is greater than the crossover rate, no conflict occurs.
•
However, if the cost of capital is less than the crossover rate, a conflict arises:
NPV ranks L higher, but IRR ranks S higher.
There are two basic conditions that cause NPV profiles to cross and thus lead to
conflicts.17
1. Timing differences. If most of the cash flows from one project come in early while
most of those from the other project come in later, then the NPV profiles may
cross and result in a conflict. This is the reason for the conflict between our
Projects S and L.
2. Project size (or scale) differences. If the amount invested in one project is larger than
the other, this can also lead to profiles crossing and a resulting conflict. If you
look back at the box titled “Why NPV is Better than IRR,” you will see an ex-
ample of the size difference conflict.
When either size or timing differences occur, the firm will have different amounts
of funds to invest in other projects in the various years, depending on which of the
two mutually exclusive projects it chooses. If it chooses S, then it will have more
funds to invest in Year 1 because S has a larger inflow that year. Similarly, if one
project costs more than the other, then the firm will have more money to invest
at t = 0 if it selects the smaller project.
Given this situation, the rate of return at which differential cash flows can be reinvested is
a critical issue. We saw earlier that the NPV assumes reinvestment at the cost of capi-
tal, and that this is generally a more reasonable assumption. Therefore, whenever con-
flicts exist between mutually exclusive projects, use the NPV method.
Self-Test
Describe in words how an NPV profile is constructed. How does one determine the
intercepts for the x-axis and the y-axis?
What is the “crossover rate,” and how does it interact with the cost of capital to
determine whether or not a conflict exists between NPV and IRR?
What two characteristics can lead to conflicts between the NPV and the IRR when
evaluating mutually exclusive projects?
17Also, if mutually exclusive projects have different lives (as opposed to different cash flow patterns over a
common life), this introduces further complications; thus, for meaningful comparisons, some mutually ex-
clusive projects must be evaluated over a common life. This point is discussed later in the chapter.

10.8 PROFITABILITY INDEX (PI)
A fourth method used to evaluate projects is the profitability index (PI):
PI ¼ PV of future cash flows
Initial cost
¼∑
N
t¼1
CFt
ð1 þ rÞt
CF0
(10-3)
Here CFt represents the expected future cash flows and CF0 represents the initial
cost. The PI shows the relative profitability of any project, or the present value per
dollar of initial cost. As we can see from Figure 10-8, the PI for Project S, based on
a 10% cost of capital, is $10,788.20/$10,000 = 1.0788; the PI for Project L is 1.1004.
Thus, Project S is expected to produce $1.0788 of present value for each $1 of invest-
ment whereas L should produce $1.1004 for each dollar invested.
A project is acceptable if its PI is greater than 1.0; and the higher the PI, the
higher the project’s ranking. Therefore, both S and L would be accepted by the PI
criterion if they were independent, and L would be ranked ahead of S if they were
mutually exclusive.
Mathematically, the NPV, IRR, MIRR, and PI methods will always lead to the
same accept/reject decisions for normal, independent projects: If a project’s NPV is
positive, its IRR and MIRR will always exceed r and its PI will always be greater than
1.0. However, these methods can give conflicting rankings for mutually exclusive proj-
ects if the projects differ in size or in the timing of cash flows. If the PI ranking con-
flicts with the NPV, then the NPV ranking should be used.
Self-Test
Explain how the PI is calculated. What does it measure?
A project has the following expected cash flows: CF0 = −$500, CF1 = $200, CF2
= $200, and CF3 = $400. If the project’s cost of capital is 9%, what is the PI? (1.32)

However, if they are mutually exclusive then Project L should be chosen because it has the higher PI.

PI and NPV rankings will be consistent if the projects have the same cost, as is true for S and L. However,
if they differ in size then conflicts can occur. In the event of a conflict, the NPV ranking should be used.

Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

10.9 PAYBACK PERIOD
NPV and IRR are the most commonly used methods today, but historically the first
selection criterion was the payback period, defined as the number of years required
to recover the funds invested in a project from its operating cash flows. Equation 10-4 is
used for the calculation, and the process is diagrammed in Figure 10-9. We start with
the project’s cost, a negative number, and then add the cash inflow for each year until
the cumulative cash flow turns positive. The payback year is the year prior to full recov-
ery, plus a fraction equal to the shortfall at the end of the prior year divided by the cash
flow during the year when full recovery occurs:18
Payback ¼

years prior to
full recovery
þ
Unrecovered cost

Cash flow during

(10-4)
The cash flows for Projects S and L, together with their paybacks, are shown in
Figure 10-9.19 The shorter the payback, the better the project. Therefore, if the
firm requires a payback of 3 years or less, then S would be accepted but L would be
rejected. If the projects were mutually exclusive, S would be ranked over L because
of its shorter payback.
The regular payback has three flaws: (1) Dollars received in different years are all
given the same weight—that is, the time value of money is ignored. (2) Cash flows be-
yond the payback year are given no consideration whatsoever, regardless of how large
they might be. (3) Unlike the NPV or the IRR, which tell us how much wealth a project
adds or how much a project’s rate of return exceeds the cost of capital, the payback

merely tells us how long it takes to recover our investment. There is no necessary rela-
tionship between a given payback period and investor wealth, so we don’t know how to
specify an acceptable payback. The firm might use 2 years, 3 years, or any other number
as the minimum acceptable payback, but the choice is purely arbitrary.
To counter the first criticism, financial analysts developed the discounted pay-
back, where cash flows are discounted at the WACC and then those discounted
cash flows are used to find the payback. In Figure 10-10 we calculate the discounted
paybacks for S and L, assuming both have a 10% cost of capital. Each inflow is di-
vided by (1 + r)t = (1.10)t, where t is the year in which the cash flow occurs and r is
the project’s cost of capital, and then those PVs are used to find the payback. Project
S’s discounted payback is 2.95 years and L’s is 3.78 years.
Note that the payback is a “break-even” calculation in the sense that if cash flows
come in at the expected rate, then the project will at least break even. However, since
the regular payback doesn’t consider the cost of capital, it doesn’t specify the true
break-even year. The discounted payback does consider capital costs, but it still dis-
regards cash flows beyond the payback year, which is a serious flaw. Further, if mu-
tually exclusive projects vary in size, both payback methods can conflict with the
NPV, and that might lead to poor decisions. Finally, there is no way to determine
how short the payback periods must be to justify accepting a project.
Although the payback methods have faults as ranking criteria, they do provide in-
formation about liquidity and risk. The shorter the payback, other things held con-
stant, the greater the project’s liquidity. This factor is often important for smaller
firms that don’t have ready access to the capital markets. Also, cash flows expected
in the distant future are generally riskier than near-term cash flows, so the payback
period is also a risk indicator.

Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

Project P has a cost of $1,000 and cash flows of $300 per year for 3 years plus an-
other $1,000 in Year 4. The project’s cost of capital is 15%. What are P’s regular and
discounted paybacks? (3.10, 3.55) If the company requires a payback of 3 years or
less, would the project be accepted? Would this be a good accept/reject decision,
considering the NPV and/or the IRR? (NPV = $256.72, IRR = 24.78%)
10.10 CONCLUSIONS ON CAPITAL BUDGETING METHODS
We have discussed six capital budgeting decision criteria: NPV, IRR, MIRR, PI, pay-
back, and discounted payback. We compared these methods with one another and
highlighted their strengths and weaknesses. In the process, we may have created the im-
pression that “sophisticated” firms should use only one method, the NPV. However,
virtually all capital budgeting decisions are analyzed by computer, so it is easy to calcu-
late using all six methods. In making the accept–reject decision, large sophisticated firms
such as FPL, GE, and Boeing generally calculate and consider all six measures, because
each provides a somewhat different piece of information about the decision.
NPV is the single best criterion because it provides a direct measure of the value a
project adds to shareholder wealth. IRR and MIRR measure profitability expressed as
a percentage rate of return, which decision makers like to consider. The PI also mea-
sures profitability but in relation to the amount of the investment. Further, IRR,
MIRR, and PI all contain information concerning a project’s “safety margin.” To il-
lustrate, consider a firm, whose WACC is 10%, that must choose between these two
mutually exclusive projects: SS (for small) has a cost of $10,000 and is expected to
return $16,500 at the end of one year; LL (for large) has a cost of $100,000 and is
expected to return $115,550 at the end of one year. SS has a huge IRR, 65%, while
LL’s IRR is a more modest 15.6%. The NPV paints a somewhat different picture: at
the 10% cost of capital, SS’s NPV is $5,000 while LL’s is $5,045. By the NPV rule
we would choose LL. However, SS’s IRR indicates that it has a much larger margin
for error: Even if its cash flow were 39% below the $16,500 forecast, the firm would
still recover its $10,000 investment. On the other hand, if LL’s inflows fell by only
13.5% from its forecasted $115,550, the firm would not recover its investment. Fur-
ther, if neither project generated any cash flows at all, the firm would lose only
$10,000 on SS but would lose $100,000 by accepting LL.
The modified IRR has all the virtues of the IRR, but it incorporates a better rein-
vestment rate assumption and also avoids the problem of multiple rates of return. So
if decision makers want to know projects’ rates of return, the MIRR is a better indi-
cator than the regular IRR.
The PI tells a similar story to the IRR. Here PILLis only 1.05 while PISS is 1.50. As
with the IRR, this indicates that Project SS’s cash inflows could decline by 50% before
it loses money, whereas a decline of only 5% in LL’s cash flows would result in a loss.
Payback and discounted payback provide indications of a project’s liquidity and
risk. A long payback means that investment dollars will be locked up for a long
time; hence the project is relatively illiquid. In addition, a long payback means that
cash flows must be forecast far into the future, and that probably makes the project
riskier than one with a shorter payback. A good analogy for this is bond valuation. An
investor should never compare the yields to maturity on two bonds without also con-
sidering their terms to maturity, because a bond’s risk is significantly influenced by
its maturity. The same holds true for capital projects.
In summary, the different measures provide different types of useful information.
It is easy to calculate all of them: Simply put the cost of capital and the cash flows
into an Excel model like the one provided in this chapter’s Tool Kit and the model
Chapter 10: The Basics of Capital Budgeting: Evaluating Cash Flows
403

will instantly calculate all six criteria. Therefore, most sophisticated companies con-
sider all six measures when making capital budgeting decisions. For most decisions,
the greatest weight should be given to the NPV, but it would be foolish to ignore
the information provided by the other criteria.
Just as it would be foolish to ignore these capital budgeting methods, it would also be
foolish to make decisions based solely on them. One cannot know at Time 0 the exact
cost of future capital or the exact future cash flows. These inputs are simply estimates,
and if they turn out to be incorrect then so will be the calculated NPVs and IRRs.
Thus, quantitative methods provide valuable information, but they should not be used as the
sole criteria for accept–reject decisions in the capital budgeting process. Rather, managers
should use quantitative methods in the decision-making process but should also consider
the likelihood that actual results will differ from the forecasts. Qualitative factors, such as
the chances of a tax increase, or a war, or a major product liability suit, should also be
considered. In summary, quantitative methods such as NPV and IRR should be considered as
an aid to informed decisions but not as a substitute for sound managerial judgment.
In this same vein, managers should ask sharp questions about any project that
has a large NPV, a high IRR, or a high PI. In a perfectly competitive economy,
there would be no positive-NPV projects—all companies would have the same op-
portunities, and competition would quickly eliminate any positive NPV. The exis-
tence of positive-NPV projects must be predicated on some imperfection in the
marketplace, and the longer the life of the project, the longer that imperfection must
last. Therefore, managers should be able to identify the imperfection and explain why it
will persist before accepting that a project will really have a positive NPV. Valid explana-
tions might include patents or proprietary technology, which is how pharmaceutical and
software firms create positive-NPV projects. Pfizer’s Lipitor (a cholesterol-reducing
medicine) and Microsoft’s Vista operating system are examples. Companies can also cre-
ate positive NPV by being the first entrant into a new market or by creating new pro-
ducts that meet some previously unidentified consumer needs. The Post-it notes
invented by 3M are an example. Similarly, Dell developed procedures for direct sales of
microcomputers and, in the process, created projects with enormous NPV. Also, compa-
nies such as Southwest Airlines have managed to train and motivate their workers better
than their competitors, and this has led to positive-NPV projects. In all of these cases, the
companies developed some source of competitive advantage, and that advantage resulted
in positive-NPV projects.
This discussion suggests three things: (1) If you can’t identify the reason a project
has a positive projected NPV, then its actual NPV will probably not be positive. (2)
Positive NPV projects don’t just happen—they result from hard work to develop
some competitive advantage. At the risk of oversimplification, the primary job of a
manager is to find and develop areas of competitive advantage. (3) Some competitive
advantages last longer than others, with their durability depending on competitors’
ability to replicate them. Patents, the control of scarce resources, or large size in an
industry where strong economies of scale exist can keep competitors at bay. How-
ever, it is relatively easy to replicate product features that cannot be patented. The
bottom line is that managers should strive to develop nonreplicable sources of com-
petitive advantage. If such an advantage cannot be demonstrated, then you should
question projects with high NPV—especially if they have long lives.

Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

10.11 DECISION CRITERIA USED IN PRACTICE
Over the years, surveys have been designed and administered to find out which of the
criteria managers actually use. Surveys prior to 1999 asked companies to indicate which
method they gave the most weight, whereas the most recent one (taken in 1999) asked
what method or methods managers actually calculated and used. A summary of all
these surveys is shown in Table 10-1, and it reveals some interesting trends.
First, the NPV criterion was not used significantly before the 1980s, but by 1999 it was
close to the top in usage. Moreover, informal discussions with companies suggest that if a
survey were taken in 2009, NPV would be at the top of this list. Second, the IRR method
was used slightly more than the NPV at the time of the last survey (1999), but its recent
growth is much less dramatic than that of NPV; if a survey were taken today, we believe
that the NPV would predominate. Third, payback was the most important criterion years
ago, but its use as the primary criterion had fallen drastically by 1980. Companies still use
payback because it is easy to calculate and provides some useful information, but it is
rarely used as the primary criterion. Fourth, “other methods,” primarily the profitability
index and the accounting rate of return (the latter of which is explained in this chapter’s
Tool Kit), have been fading due to the increased use of IRR and especially NPV.
These trends are consistent with our evaluation of the various methods. NPV is
the best single criterion, but all of the methods provide useful information and are
easy to calculate. Hence all are used, along with judgment and common sense. We
will have more to say about all this in the next chapter.

with mutually exclusive projects whose lives differ; (2) the potential advantage of ter-

Mutually Exclusive Projects with Unequal Lives
When choosing between two mutually exclusive alternatives with significantly dif-
ferent lives, an adjustment is necessary. For example, suppose a company is plan-
ning to modernize its production facilities and is considering either a conveyor
system (Project C) or a fleet of forklift trucks (Project F) for moving materials.
The first two sections of Figure 10-11 show the expected net cash flows, NPVs,
and IRRs for these two mutually exclusive alternatives. We see that Project C,
when discounted at the firm’s 12% cost of capital, has the higher NPV and thus
appears to be the better project.
Although the NPVs shown in Figure 10-11 suggest that Project C should be selected,
this analysis is incomplete, and the decision to choose Project C is actually incorrect. If
we choose Project F, we will have an opportunity to make a similar investment in 3
years, and if cost and revenue conditions continue at the levels shown in Figure 10-11,
then this second investment will also be profitable. However, if we choose Project C, we
cannot make this second investment. Two different approaches can be used to correctly
compare Projects C and F, as shown in Figure 10-11 and discussed next.
Replacement Chains.
The key to the replacement chain, or common life, approach is to
analyze both projects over an equal life. In our example, Project C has a 6-year life, so we
assume that Project F will be repeated after 3 years and then analyze it over the same 6-
year period. We can then calculate the NPV of C and compare it to the extended-life
NPV of Project F. The NPV for Project C, as shown in Figure 10-11, is already based
on the 6-year common life. For Project F, however, we must add in a second project to
extend the overall life to 6 years. The time line for this extended project, denoted as “All
CFs for FF,” is shown in Figure 10-11. Here we assume (1) that Project F’s cost and
annual cash inflows will not change if the project is repeated in 3 years and (2) that the
cost of capital will remain at 12%.
The NPV of this extended Project F is $8,824, and its IRR is 25.2%. (The IRR of
two Project Fs is the same as the IRR for one Project F.) However, the $8,824 ex-
tended NPV of Project F is greater than Project C’s $6,491 NPV, so Project F
should be selected.

Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

Alternatively, we could recognize that Project F has an NPV of $5,155 at Time 0
and a second NPV of that same amount at Time 3, then find the PV of the second
NPV at Time 0, and sum the two to find Project F’s extended-life NPV of $8,824.
Equivalent Annual Annuities (EAA).
Electrical engineers designing power
plants and distribution lines were the first to encounter the unequal life problem.
They could install transformers and other equipment that had relatively low initial
costs but short lives, or they could use equipment that had higher initial costs but
longer lives. The services would be required into the indefinite future, so this was
the issue: Which choice would result in a higher NPV in the long run? The engi-
neers converted the annual cash flows under the alternative investments into a con-
stant cash flow stream whose NPV was equal to, or equivalent to, the NPV of the
initial stream. This was called the equivalent annual annuity (EAA) method. To
apply the EAA method to Projects C and F, for each project we simply find the con-
stant payment streams that the projects’ NPVs ($6,491 for C and $5,155 for F) would
provide over their respective lives. Using a financial calculator for Project C, we en-
ter N = 6, I/YR = 12, PV = −6491, and FV = 0. Then, when we press the PMT key,
we find EAAC = $1,579. For Project F, we enter N = 3, I/YR = 12, PV = −5155, and
FV = 0; solving for PMT, we find EAAF = $2,146. Project F would thus produce a
higher cash flow stream over the 6 years, so it is the better project.
Conclusions about Unequal Lives.
When should we worry about analysis of
unequal lives? The unequal life issue (1) does not arise for independent projects but
(2) can arise if mutually exclusive projects with significantly different lives are being com-
pared. However, even for mutually exclusive projects, it is not always appropriate to ex-
tend the analysis to a common life. This should be done if and only if there is a high
probability that the projects will actually be repeated at the end of their initial lives.
We should note several potentially serious weaknesses inherent in this type of analysis.
(1) If inflation occurs, then replacement equipment will have a higher price. Moreover,
both sales prices and operating costs would probably change. Thus, the static conditions
built into the analysis would be invalid. (2) Replacements that occur down the road would
probably employ new technology, which in turn might change the cash flows. (3) It is dif-
ficult enough to estimate the lives of most projects, and even more so to estimate the lives
of a series of projects. In view of these problems, no experienced financial analyst would
be too concerned about comparing mutually exclusive projects with lives of, say, 8 years
and 10 years. Given all the uncertainties in the estimation process, such projects would,
for all practical purposes, be assumed to have the same life. Still, it is important to recog-
nize that a problem exists if mutually exclusive projects have substantially different lives.
When we encounter situations in practice where significant differences in project
lives are encountered, we first use a computer spreadsheet to build expected inflation
and/or possible efficiency gains directly into the cash flow estimates and then use the
replacement chain approach. We prefer the replacement chain approach for two rea-
sons. First, it is easier to explain to those who are responsible for approving capital
budgets. Second, it is easier to build inflation and other modifications into a spread-
sheet and then go on to make the replacement chain calculations.
Economic Life versus Physical Life
Projects are normally evaluated under the assumption that the firm will operate them over
their full physical lives. However, this may not be the best plan—it may be better to ter-
minate a project before the end of its potential life. For example, the cost of maintenance
for trucks and machinery can become quite high if they are used for too many years, so it
might be better to replace them before the end of their potential lives.
Chapter 10: The Basics of Capital Budgeting: Evaluating Cash Flows
407

Figure 10-12 provides data for an asset with a physical life of 3 years. However,
the project can be terminated at the end of any year and the asset sold at the indi-
cated salvage values. All of the cash flows are after taxes, and the firm’s cost of capital
is 10%. The undiscounted cash flows are shown in Columns C and D in the upper
part of the figure, and the present values of these flows are shown in Columns E and
F. We find the project’s NPV under different assumptions about how long it will be
operated. If the project is operated for its full 3-year life, it will have a negative NPV.
The NPV will be positive if it is operated for 2 years and then the asset is sold for a
relatively high salvage value; the NPV will be negative if the asset is disposed after
only 1 year of operation. Therefore, the project’s optimal life is 2 years.
This type of analysis is used to determine a project’s economic life, which is the life
that maximizes the NPV and thus shareholder wealth. For our project, the economic life
is 2 years versus the 3-year physical, or engineering, life. Note that this analysis was
based on the expected cash flows and the expected salvage values, and it should always be
conducted as a part of the capital budgeting evaluation if salvage values are relatively high.
The Optimal Capital Budget
The optimal capital budget is defined as the set of projects that maximizes the value
of the firm. Finance theory states that all independent projects with positive NPVs
should be accepted, as should the mutually exclusive projects with the highest
NPVs. Therefore, the optimal capital budget consists of that set of projects. How-
ever, two complications arise in practice: (1) The cost of capital might increase as
the size of the capital budget increases, making it hard to know the proper discount
rate to use when evaluating projects; and (2) sometimes firms set an upper limit on
the size of their capital budgets, which is also known as capital rationing.

An Increasing Cost of Capital.
The cost of capital may increase as the capital
budget increases—this is called an increasing marginal cost of capital. As we discussed
in Chapter 9, flotation costs associated with issuing new equity can be quite high.
This means that the cost of capital will increase once a company has invested all of
its internally generated cash and must sell new common stock. In addition, once a
firm has used up its normal credit lines and must seek additional debt capital, it may
encounter an increase in its cost of debt. This means that a project might have a pos-
itive NPV if it is part of a $10 million capital budget but the same project might have
a negative NPV if it is part of a $20 million capital budget because the cost of capital
might increase.
Fortunately, these problems rarely occur for most firms, especially those that are
stable and well established. When a rising cost of capital is encountered, we would pro-
ceed as indicated below. You can look at Figure 10-13 as you read through our points.

•
Find the IRR (or MIRR) on all potential projects, arrange them in rank order
(along with their initial costs), and then plot them on a graph with the IRR on
the vertical axis and the cumulative costs on the horizontal axis. The firm’s data
are shown in Figure 10-13, and the IRRs are plotted in the graph. The line is
called the Investment Opportunity Schedule (IOS), and it shows the marginal
return on capital.
•
Next, determine how much capital can be raised before it is necessary to issue
new common stock or go to higher-cost sources of debt, and identify the
amounts of higher-cost capital. Use this information to calculate the WACC that
corresponds to the different amounts of capital raised. In this example, the firm
can raise $300 before the WACC rises, but the WACC increases as additional
capital is raised. The increasing WACC represents the marginal cost of capital,
and its graph is called the Marginal Cost of Capital (MCC) schedule.
•
The intersection of the IOS and MCC schedules indicates the amount of capital
the firm should raise and invest, and it is analogous to the familiar marginal cost
versus marginal revenue schedule discussed in introductory economics courses.
In our example, the firm should have a capital budget of $400; if it uses a WACC
of 10% then it will accept projects A, B, C, and D, which have a cumulative cost
of $400. The 10% WACC should be used for average-risk projects, but it should
be scaled up or down for more or less risky projects as discussed in Chapter 9.
Our example illustrates the case of a firm that cannot raise all the money it needs
at a constant WACC. Firms should not try to be too precise with this process—the
data are not good enough for precision—but they should be aware of the concept
and get at least a rough idea of how raising additional capital will affect the WACC.
Capital Rationing.
Armbrister Pyrotechnics, a manufacturer of fireworks and
lasers for light shows, has identified 40 potential independent projects, of which 15
have a positive NPV based on the firm’s 12% cost of capital. The total investment
required to implement these 15 projects would be $75 million and so, according to
finance theory, the optimal capital budget is $75 million. Thus, Armbrister should
accept the 15 projects with positive NPVs and invest $75 million. However, Armbris-
ter’s management has imposed a limit of $50 million for capital expenditures during
the upcoming year. Because of this restriction, the company must forgo a number of
value-adding projects. This is an example of capital rationing, defined as a situation
in which a firm limits its capital expenditures to an amount less than would be re-
quired to fund the optimal capital budget. Despite being at odds with finance theory,
this practice is quite common.
Why would any company forgo value-adding projects? Here are some potential
explanations, along with some suggestions for better ways to handle these situations.
1. Reluctance to issue new stock. Many firms are extremely reluctant to issue new stock,
so all of their capital expenditures must be funded out of debt and internally
generated cash. Also, most firms try to stay near their target capital structure,
and, when combined with the limit on equity, this limits the amount of debt that
can be added during any one year without raising the cost of that debt as well as
the cost of equity. The result can be a serious constraint on the amount of funds
available for investment in new projects.
The reluctance to issue new stock could be based on some sound reasons:
(a) flotation costs can be very expensive; (b) investors might perceive new stock
offerings as a signal that the company’s equity is overvalued; and (c) the company
might have to reveal sensitive strategic information to investors, thereby reducing
410
Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

some of its competitive advantages. To avoid these costs, many companies simply
limit their capital expenditures.
However, rather than placing a somewhat artificial limit on capital expendi-
tures, companies might be better off explicitly incorporating the costs of raising
external capital into their costs of capital along the lines shown in Figure 10-13.
If there still are positive-NPV projects even with the higher cost of capital, then
the company should go ahead and raise external equity and accept the projects.
2. Constraints on nonmonetary resources. Sometimes a firm simply doesn’t have the
necessary managerial, marketing, or engineering talent to immediately accept all
positive-NPV projects. In other words, the potential projects may be independent
from a demand standpoint but not from an internal standpoint, because accepting
them all would raise the firm’s costs. To avoid potential problems due to spread-
ing existing talent too thinly, many firms simply limit the capital budget to a size
that can be accommodated by their current personnel.
A better solution might be to employ a technique called linear programming.
Each potential project has an expected NPV, and each potential project requires a
certain level of support by different types of employees. A linear program can identify
the set of projects that maximizes NPV subject to the constraint that the total amount of
support required for these projects does not exceed the available resources.
3. Controlling estimation bias. Many managers become overly optimistic when esti-
mating the cash flows for a project. Some firms try to control this estimation bias
by requiring managers to use an unrealistically high cost of capital. Others try to
control the bias by limiting the size of the capital budget. Neither solution is
generally effective, because managers quickly learn the rules of the game and
then increase their own estimates of project cash flows, which might have been
biased upward to begin with.
A better solution is to implement a post-audit program and to link the accu-
racy of forecasts to the compensation of the managers who initiated the projects.

Summary
This chapter has described six techniques that are used in capital budgeting analysis:
NPV, IRR, MIRR, PI, payback, and discounted payback. Each approach provides a dif-
ferent piece of information, so in this age of computers, managers often look at all of
them when evaluating projects. However, NPV is the best single measure, and almost
all firms now use NPV. The key concepts covered in this chapter are listed below.
•
Capital budgeting is the process of analyzing potential projects. Capital bud-
geting decisions are probably the most important ones that managers must make.
•
The net present value (NPV) method discounts all cash flows at the project’s
cost of capital and then sums those cash flows. The project should be accepted if
the NPV is positive because such a project increases shareholders’ value.
Chapter 10: The Basics of Capital Budgeting: Evaluating Cash Flows
411

•
The internal rate of return (IRR) is defined as the discount rate that forces a
project’s NPV to equal zero. The project should be accepted if the IRR is
greater than the cost of capital.
•
The NPV and IRR methods make the same accept–reject decisions for inde-
pendent projects, but if projects are mutually exclusive then ranking conflicts
can arise. In such cases, the NPV method should generally be relied upon.
•
The NPV method assumes that cash flows will be reinvested at the firm’s cost of
capital, whereas the IRR method assumes reinvestment at the project’s IRR. Rein-
vestment at the cost of capital is generally a better assumption because it is closer to reality.
•
The modified IRR (MIRR) method corrects some of the problems with the
regular IRR. MIRR involves finding the terminal value (TV) of the cash in-
flows, compounding them at the firm’s cost of capital, and then determining the
discount rate that forces the present value of the TV to equal the present value
of the outflows. Thus, the MIRR assumes reinvestment at the cost of capital, not
at the IRR. If management wants to know the rate of return on projects, the
MIRR is a better estimate than the regular IRR.
•
The profitability index (PI) is calculated by dividing the present value of cash
inflows by the initial cost, so it measures relative profitability—that is, the
amount of the present value per dollar of investment.
•
The regular payback period is defined as the number of years required to re-
cover a project’s cost. The regular payback method has three flaws: It ignores
cash flows beyond the payback period, it does not consider the time value of
money, and it doesn’t give a precise acceptance rule. The payback does, however,
provide an indication of a project’s risk and liquidity, because it shows how long
the invested capital will be tied up.
•
The discounted payback is similar to the regular payback except that it dis-
counts cash flows at the project’s cost of capital. It considers the time value of
money, but it still ignores cash flows beyond the payback period.
•
The chapter’s Tool Kit Excel model and Web Extension 10A describe another
but seldom-used evaluation method, the accounting rate of return.
•
If mutually exclusive projects have unequal lives, it may be necessary to adjust
the analysis to put the projects on an equal-life basis. This can be done using the
replacement chain (common life) approach or the equivalent annual annuity
(EAA) approach.
•
A project’s true value may be greater than the NPV based on its physical life if
it can be terminated at the end of its economic life.
•
Flotation costs and increased risk associated with unusually large expansion pro-
grams can cause the marginal cost of capital to increase as the size of the capital
budget increases.
•
Capital rationing occurs when management places a constraint on the size of
the firm’s capital budget during a particular period.

Davis Industries must choose between a gas-powered and an electric-powered

investments.) The electric-powered truck will cost more, but it will be less expen-
sive to operate; it will cost $22,000, whereas the gas-powered truck will cost
$17,500. The cost of capital that applies to both investments is 12%. The life
for both types of truck is estimated to be 6 years, during which time the net
cash flows for the electric-powered truck will be $6,290 per year and those for
the gas-powered truck will be $5,000 per year. Annual net cash flows include de-

NPV and IRR Analysis
After discovering a new gold vein in the Colorado mountains, CTC Mining Corpo-

mined will net the firm an estimated $350,000 each year for the 5-year life of the
vein. CTC’s cost of capital is 14%. For the purposes of this problem, assume that
the cash inflows occur at the end of the year.

Timing Differences
The Ewert Exploration Company is considering two mutually exclusive plans for ex-
tracting oil on property for which it has mineral rights. Both plans call for the expen-
diture of $10 million to drill development wells. Under Plan A, all the oil will be
extracted in 1 year, producing a cash flow at t = 1 of $12 million; under Plan B,
cash flows will be $1.75 million per year for 20 years.
a. What are the annual incremental cash flows that will be available to Ewert Ex-
ploration if it undertakes Plan B rather than Plan A? (Hint: Subtract Plan A’s
flows from B’s.)
b. If the company accepts Plan A and then invests the extra cash generated at the
end of Year 1, what rate of return (reinvestment rate) would cause the cash flows
from reinvestment to equal the cash flows from Plan B?
c. Suppose a firm’s cost of capital is 10%. Is it logical to assume that the firm would
take on all available independent projects (of average risk) with returns greater
than 10%? Further, if all available projects with returns greater than 10% have
been taken, would this mean that cash flows from past investments would have
an opportunity cost of only 10%, because all the firm could do with these cash
flows would be to replace money that has a cost of 10%? Finally, does this imply
that the cost of capital is the correct rate to assume for the reinvestment of a
project’s cash flows?

The Perez Company has the opportunity to invest in one of two mutually exclusive ma-
chines that will produce a product it will need for the foreseeable future. Machine A
costs $10 million but realizes after-tax inflows of $4 million per year for 4 years. After
4 years, the machine must be replaced. Machine B costs $15 million and realizes after-
tax inflows of $3.5 million per year for 8 years, after which it must be replaced. Assume
that machine prices are not expected to rise because inflation will be offset by cheaper
components used in the machines. The cost of capital is 10%. By how much would the
value of the company increase if it accepted the better machine? What is the equivalent
annual annuity for each machine?

Unequal Lives
Filkins Fabric Company is considering the replacement of its old, fully depreciated knit-
ting machine. Two new models are available: Machine 190-3, which has a cost of
$190,000, a 3-year expected life, and after-tax cash flows (labor savings and depreciation)
of $87,000 per year; and Machine 360-6, which has a cost of $360,000, a 6-year life, and
after-tax cash flows of $98,300 per year. Knitting machine prices are not expected to rise,
because inflation will be offset by cheaper components (microprocessors) used in the ma-
chines. Assume that Filkins’s cost of capital is 14%. Should the firm replace its old knit-
ting machine? If so, which new machine should it use? By how much would the value of
the company increase if it accepted the better machine? What is the equivalent annual
annuity for each machine?

Mini Case
You have just graduated from the MBA program of a large university, and one of your favorite
courses was “Today’s Entrepreneurs.” In fact, you enjoyed it so much you have decided you
want to “be your own boss.” While you were in the master’s program, your grandfather died
and left you $1 million to do with as you please. You are not an inventor, and you do not have
a trade skill that you can market; however, you have decided that you would like to purchase
at least one established franchise in the fast-foods area, maybe two (if profitable). The problem
is that you have never been one to stay with any project for too long, so you figure that your
time frame is 3 years. After 3 years you will go on to something else.
You have narrowed your selection down to two choices: (1) Franchise L, Lisa’s Soups, Sal-
ads, & Stuff, and (2) Franchise S, Sam’s Fabulous Fried Chicken. The net cash flows shown
below include the price you would receive for selling the franchise in Year 3 and the forecast
of how each franchise will do over the 3-year period. Franchise L’s cash flows will start off
slowly but will increase rather quickly as people become more health-conscious, while Fran-
chise S’s cash flows will start off high but will trail off as other chicken competitors enter the
marketplace and as people become more health-conscious and avoid fried foods. Franchise L
serves breakfast and lunch whereas Franchise S serves only dinner, so it is possible for you to
invest in both franchises. You see these franchises as perfect complements to one another: You
could attract both the lunch and dinner crowds and the health-conscious and not-
so-health-conscious crowds without the franchises directly competing against one another.
Here are the net cash flows (in thousands of dollars):

You also have made subjective risk assessments of each franchise and concluded that both

b. What is the difference between independent and mutually exclusive projects?
c. (1) Define the term net present value (NPV). What is each franchise’s NPV?
(2) What is the rationale behind the NPV method? According to NPV, which franchise

j. As a separate project (Project P), you are considering sponsorship of a pavilion at the
upcoming World’s Fair. The pavilion would cost $800,000, and it is expected to result
in $5 million of incremental cash inflows during its single year of operation. However,
it would then take another year, and $5 million of costs, to demolish the site and return
it to its original condition. Thus, Project P’s expected net cash flows look like this (in
millions of dollars):

(2) What is Project P’s NPV? What is its IRR? Its MIRR?
(3) Draw Project P’s NPV profile. Does Project P have normal or nonnormal cash flows?

Cash Flow Estimation
and Risk Analysis
I
n the last chapter we discussed how the recession caused FPL Group to
reduce its planned capital expenditures from $7 billion to $5.3 billion. That
change rippled through the economy. It reduced FPL’s job count, which
had a negative effect on housing and retail sales in Florida, where most of
its operations are based. It also led to job losses in supplier firms like GE
that would have supplied FPL with wind turbines and other materials
needed for the canceled projects. It reduced our “green” power and thus
increased our reliance on coal and foreign oil. Sales taxes, property taxes,
and income taxes also fell, negatively affecting cities and states as well as
the federal government.
FPL’s experience was matched by thousands of other businesses all
over the world; in this way, it exacerbated the global recession and
increased the possibilities of a 1930’s type depression. Government
leaders, from President Obama on down, recognized this, and they
authorized spending trillions of dollars on programs designed to push back
the tide and get the ship righted and back on course. No one knows either
how well the stimulus program will work or how long it will take to get things
back on track. Still, companies like FPL, its suppliers, retailers who depend
on workers for sales, and governments who depend on all of the above for
tax revenues must make decisions based on predictions about the future.
This chapter obviously can’t teach you how to solve the problems of the
world, but it does set forth a framework for making capital expenditure
decisions in a world of uncertainty. If companies use the procedures we
recommend, this will help avoid serious recessions in the future.

The basic principles of capital budgeting were covered in Chapter 10. Given a pro-
ject’s expected cash flows, it is easy to calculate its NPV, IRR, MIRR, PI, payback,
and discounted payback. Unfortunately, cash flows are rarely just given—rather, man-
agers must estimate them based on information collected from sources both inside and
outside the company. Moreover, uncertainty surrounds the cash flow estimates, and
some projects are riskier than others. In the first part of this chapter, we develop pro-
cedures for estimating the cash flows associated with capital budgeting projects. Then,
in the second part, we discuss techniques used to measure and take account of project
risk.
11.1 CONCEPTUAL ISSUES
The most important but also the most difficult step in capital budgeting is estimating
project cash flows. Many variables are involved, and many individuals and depart-
ments participate in the process. For example, the forecasts of unit sales and sales
prices are normally made by the marketing group based on their knowledge of price
elasticity, advertising effects, the state of the economy, competitors’ reactions, and
trends in consumers’ tastes. Similarly, the capital outlays associated with a new prod-
uct are generally obtained from the engineering and product development staffs,
while operating costs are estimated by cost accountants, production experts, person-
nel specialists, purchasing agents, and so forth.
A proper analysis includes (1) obtaining information from various departments
such as engineering and marketing, (2) ensuring that everyone involved with the
forecast uses a consistent set of realistic economic assumptions, and (3) making sure
Corporate Valuation, Cash Flows, and Risk Analysis
When we estimate a project’s cash flows (CF) and then
discount them at the project’s risk-adjusted cost of cap-
ital, r, the result is the project’s NPV, which tells us how
much the project increases the firm’s value. This chap-
ter focuses on how to estimate the size and risk of a
project’s cash flows.
Note too that project cash flows, once a project has
been accepted and placed in operation, are added to
the firm’s free cash flows from other sources. Therefore,
projects’ cash flows essentially determine the firm’s free
cash flows as discussed in Chapter 2 and thus form the
basis for the firm’s market value and stock price.

that no biases are inherent in the forecasts. This last point is extremely important,
because some managers become emotionally involved with pet projects and others
push projects in order to build empires. Both problems cause cash flow forecast
biases that make bad projects look good—on paper!
A number of conceptual issues arise in the cash flow estimation process. Some of
these are covered in the balance of this section. Some of them are illustrated in the
examples we explore in the subsequent sections.
Cash Flow versus Accounting Income
We saw in Chapter 2 that free cash flow differs from accounting income: Free cash
flow is cash flow that is available for distribution to investors; hence free cash flow is
the basis of a firm’s value. It is common in the practice of finance to speak of a firm’s
free cash flow and a project’s cash flow (or net cash flow), but these are based on the
same concepts. In fact, a project’s cash flow is identical to the project’s free cash flow,
and a firm’s total net cash flow from all projects is equal to the firm’s free cash flow.
We will follow the typical convention and refer to a project’s free cash flow simply as
project cash flow, but keep in mind that the two concepts are identical.1
Because net income is not equal to the cash flow available for distribution to inves-
tors, in the last chapter we discounted net cash flows, not accounting income, to find pro-
jects’ NPVs. For capital budgeting purposes it is the project’s net cash flow, not its accounting
income, that is relevant. Therefore, when analyzing a proposed capital budgeting project,
disregard the project’s net income and focus exclusively on its net cash flow.2 Be espe-
cially alert to the following differences between cash flow and accounting income.
The Cash Flow Effect of Asset Purchases and Depreciation.
Most projects re-
quire assets, and asset purchases represent negative cash flows. Even though the ac-
quisition of assets results in a cash outflow, accountants do not show the purchase
of fixed assets as a deduction from accounting income. Instead, they deduct a depre-
ciation expense each year throughout the life of the asset. Depreciation shelters in-
come from taxation, and this has an impact on cash flow, but depreciation itself is
not a cash flow. Therefore, depreciation must be added back when estimating a pro-
ject’s operating cash flow.
Depreciation is the most common noncash charge, but there are many other non-
cash charges that might appear on a company’s financial statements. Just as with de-
preciation, all other noncash charges should be added back when calculating a
project’s net cash flow.
1When the financial press refers to a firm’s “net cash flow,” it is almost always equal to the definition we
provide in Chapter 2 (which simply adds back depreciation and any other noncash charges to net income).
However, as we explained in Chapter 2, the net cash flow from operations (from the statement of cash
flows) and the firm’s free cash flow are much more useful measures of cash flow. When financial analysts
within a company use the term “a project’s net cash flow,” they almost always calculate it as we do in this
chapter, which is in essence the project’s free cash flow. Thus, free cash flow means the same thing
whether you calculate it for a firm or for a project. On the other hand, when the financial press talks
about a firm’s net cash flow or when an internal analysts talks about a project’s net cash flow, those “net
cash flows” are not the same.
2This statement is theoretically correct but sometimes an overstatement in the real world. Stockholders in
publicly owned companies do look at accounting income, it affects stock prices, and those prices affect the
cost of capital. Therefore, if a project would have a negative effect on net income but a positive effect on
cash flows, management should focus primarily on cash flows but try to communicate to investors that
(1) the adverse effect on net income is temporary and (2) in the long run, the positive effect on cash flows
will show up in future net income. Privately owned companies don’t have this problem—they can and do
focus almost exclusively on cash flows, and that’s a significant advantage of private ownership.
Chapter 11: Cash Flow Estimation and Risk Analysis
425

Changes in Net Operating Working Capital.
Normally, additional inventories
are required to support a new operation, and expanded sales tie up additional funds
in accounts receivable. However, payables and accruals increase as a result of the
expansion, and this reduces the cash needed to finance inventories and receivables.
The difference between the required increase in operating current assets and the in-
crease in operating current liabilities is the change in net operating working capital.
If this change is positive, as it generally is for expansion projects, then additional
financing—beyond the cost of the fixed assets—will be needed.
Toward the end of a project’s life, inventories will be used but not replaced, and
receivables will be collected without corresponding replacements. As these changes
occur the firm will receive cash inflows; as a result, the investment in net operating
working capital will be returned by the end of the project’s life.
Interest Charges Are Not Included in Project Cash Flows.
Interest is a cash
expense, so at first blush it would seem that interest on any debt used to finance
a project should be deducted when we estimate the project’s net cash flows.
However, this is not correct. Recall from Chapter 10 that we discount a project’s
cash flows by its risk-adjusted cost of capital, which is a weighted average
(WACC) of the costs of debt, preferred stock, and common equity, adjusted for
the project’s risk and debt capacity. This project cost of capital is the rate of re-
turn necessary to satisfy all of the firm’s investors, including stockholders and
debtholders. A common mistake made by many students and financial managers
is to subtract interest payments when estimating a project’s cash flows. This is a
mistake because the cost of debt is already embedded in the cost of capital, so
subtracting interest payments from the project’s cash flows would amount to
double-counting interest costs. Therefore, you should not subtract interest expenses
when finding a project’s cash flows.3
Timing of Cash Flows: Yearly versus Other Periods
In theory, in capital budgeting analyses we should discount cash flows based on the
exact moment when they occur. Therefore, one could argue that daily cash flows
would be better than annual flows. However, it would be costly to estimate daily
cash flows and laborious to analyze them, and in general the analysis would be no
better than one using annual flows because we simply can’t make accurate forecasts
of daily cash flows more than a couple of months into the future. Therefore, it is
generally appropriate to assume that all cash flows occur at the end of the various
years. But for projects with highly predictable cash flows, such as constructing a
building and then leasing it on a long-term basis (with monthly payments) to a finan-
cially sound tenant, we would analyze the project using monthly periods.
Incremental Cash Flows
The relevant cash flows to be used in project analysis are the difference between the
cash flows the firm will have if it implements the project versus the cash flows it will
have if it rejects the project. These are called incremental cash flows:
3Some years ago the interest situation was debated in the academic literature. One position was that inter-
est should be deducted, resulting in the net cash flow to stockholders, and then that cash flow should be
discounted at the cost of common equity. It was demonstrated that equity flows discounted at the equity
cost and operating flows discounted at the WACC led to the same conclusions. Now most academics rec-
ommend the operating cash flow approach, and it is practiced by most companies.
426
Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

Incremental cash flows ¼ Company’s cash flows
with the project
−Company’s cash flows
without the project
We discuss several types of incremental cash flows in the following sections.
Expansion Projects and Replacement Projects
Two types of projects can be distinguished: (1) expansion projects, in which the firm
makes an investment in, for example, a new Home Depot store in Seattle; and (2)
replacement projects, in which the firm replaces existing assets, generally to reduce
costs. In expansion projects, the cash expenditures on buildings, equipment, and re-
quired working capital are obviously incremental, as are the sales revenues and oper-
ating costs associated with the project. The incremental costs associated with
replacement projects are not so obvious. For example, Home Depot might replace
some of its delivery trucks to reduce fuel and maintenance expenses. Replacement
analysis is complicated by the fact that most of the relevant cash flows are the cash
flow differences between the existing project and the replacement project. For exam-
ple, the fuel bill for a more efficient new truck might be $10,000 per year versus
$15,000 for the old truck, and the $5,000 fuel savings would be an incremental cash
flow associated with the replacement decision. We analyze an expansion and replace-
ment decision later in the chapter.
Sunk Costs
A sunk cost is an outlay related to the project that was incurred in the past and can-
not be recovered in the future regardless of whether or not the project is accepted.
Therefore, sunk costs are not incremental costs and thus are not relevant in a capital
budgeting analysis.
To illustrate, suppose Home Depot spent $2 million to investigate sites for a po-
tential new store in a given area. That $2 million is a sunk cost—the money is gone,
and it won’t come back regardless of whether or not a new store is built. Therefore,
the $2 million should not be included in a capital budgeting decision.
Improper treatment of sunk costs can lead to bad decisions. For example, suppose
Home Depot completed the analysis for a new store and found that it must spend an
additional (or incremental) $17 million to build and supply the store, on top of the $2
million already spent on the site study. Suppose the present value of future cash flows
is $18 million. Should the project be accepted? If the sunk costs are mistakenly in-
cluded, the NPV is −$2 million + (−$17 million) + $18 million = −$1 million and the
project would be rejected. However, that would be a bad decision. The real issue is
whether the incremental $17 million would result in enough incremental cash flow to
produce a positive NPV. If the $2 million sunk cost were disregarded, as it should be,
then the NPV on an incremental basis would be a positive $1 million.
Opportunity Costs Associated with Assets
the Firm Already Owns
Another conceptual issue relates to opportunity costs related to assets the firm al-
ready owns. Continuing our example, suppose Home Depot (HD) owns land with a
current market value of $2 million that can be used for the new store if it decides to
build the store. If HD goes forward with the project, only another $15 million will be
required, not the full $17 million, because it will not need to buy the required land.
Does this mean that HD should use the $15 million incremental cost as the cost of
the new store? The answer is definitely “no.” If the new store is not built, then HD
Chapter 11: Cash Flow Estimation and Risk Analysis

could sell the land and receive a cash flow of $2 million. This $2 million is an oppor-
tunity cost—it is cash that HD would not receive if the land is used for the new store.
Therefore, the $2 million must be charged to the new project, and failing to do so
would cause the new project’s calculated NPV to be too high.
Externalities
Another conceptual issue relates to externalities, which are the effects of a project
on other parts of the firm or on the environment. As explained in what follows, there
are three types of externalities: negative within-firm externalities, positive within-firm
externalities, and environmental externalities.
Negative Within-Firm Externalities.
If a retailer like Home Depot opens a
new store that is close to its existing stores, then the new store might attract custo-
mers who would otherwise buy from the existing stores, reducing the old stores’ cash
flows. Therefore, the new store’s incremental cash flow must be reduced by the
amount of the cash flow lost by its other units. This type of externality is called can-
nibalization, because the new business eats into the company’s existing business.
Many businesses are subject to cannibalization. For example, each new iPod model
cannibalizes existing models. Those lost cash flows should be considered, and that
means charging them as a cost when analyzing new products.
Dealing properly with negative externalities requires careful thinking. If Apple de-
cided not to come out with a new model of iPod because of cannibalization, another
company might come out with a similar new model, causing Apple to lose sales on
existing models. Apple must examine the total situation, and this is definitely more
than a simple, mechanical analysis. Experience and knowledge of the industry is re-
quired to make good decisions in most cases.
One of the best examples of a company getting into trouble as a result of not deal-
ing correctly with cannibalization was IBM’s response when personal computers were
first developed in the 1970s. IBM’s mainframes dominated the computer industry,
and they generated huge profits. IBM used its technology to enter the PC market,
and initially it was the leading PC company. However, its top managers decided to
deemphasize the PC division because they were afraid it would hurt the more profit-
able mainframe business. That decision opened the door for Apple, Dell, Hewlett
Packard, Sony, and Chinese competitors to take PC business away from IBM. As a
result, IBM went from being the most profitable firm in the world to one whose
very survival was threatened. IBM’s experience highlights that, even as it’s essential
to understand the theory of finance, it is equally important to understand the indus-
try and the long-run consequences of a given decision. Good judgment is an essential
element for good financial decisions.
Positive Within-Firm Externalities.
As we noted earlier, cannibalization occurs
when a new product competes with an old one. However, a new project can also be com-
plementary to an old one, in which case cash flows in the old operation will be increased
when the new one is introduced. For example, Apple’s iPod was a profitable product, but
when Apple considered an investment in its music store it realized that the store would
boost sales of iPods. So, even if an analysis of the proposed music store indicated a
negative NPV, the analysis would not be complete unless the incremental cash flows
that would occur in the iPod division were credited to the music store. Consideration
of positive externalities often changes a project’s NPV from negative to positive.
Environmental Externalities.
The most common type of negative externality is
a project’s impact on the environment. Government rules and regulations constrain
428
Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

what companies can do, but firms have some flexibility in dealing with the environ-
ment. For example, suppose a manufacturer is studying a proposed new plant. The
company could meet current environmental regulations at a cost of $1 million, but
the plant would still emit fumes that would cause some bad will in its neighborhood.
Those ill feelings would not show up in the cash flow analysis, but they should still
be considered. Perhaps a relatively small additional expenditure would reduce the
emissions substantially, make the plant look good relative to other plants in the
area, and provide goodwill that in the future would help the firm’s sales and its nego-
tiations with governmental agencies.
Of course, all firms’ profits depend on the Earth remaining healthy, so companies
have an incentive to do things that protect the environment even though those ac-
tions are not currently required. However, if one firm decides to take actions that
are good for the environment but quite costly, then either it must raise its prices or
suffer a decline in earnings. If its competitors decide to get by with less costly but
environmentally unfriendly processes, they can price their products lower and make
more money. Of course, the more environmentally friendly companies can advertise
their environmental efforts, and this might—or might not—offset their higher costs.
All this illustrates why government regulations are often necessary. Finance, politics,
and the environment are all interconnected.
Self-Test
Why should companies use a project’s net cash flows rather than its accounting
income when determining a project’s NPV?
Explain the following terms: incremental cash flow, sunk cost, opportunity cost,
externality, cannibalization, and complementary project.
Provide an example of a “good” externality—that is, one that increases a project’s
true NPV over what it would be if just its own cash flows were considered.
11.2 ANALYSIS OF AN EXPANSION PROJECT
Chapter 10 assumed that estimated cash flows were already available and then pro-
ceeded to illustrate how project cash flows are evaluated. In this chapter, we illus-
trate how cash flows are estimated by analyzing a project under consideration by
Guyton Products Company (GPC). The project is the application of a radically
new technology to a new type of solar water heater, which will be manufactured
under a 4-year license from a university. It’s not clear how well the water heater
will work, how strong demand for it will be, how long it will be before the product
becomes obsolete, or whether the license can be renewed after the initial 4 years.
Still, the water heater has the potential for being quite profitable, though it could
also fail miserably. GPC is a relatively large company and this is just one of its
projects, so a failure would not bankrupt the firm but would hurt profits and the
stock’s price.
Cash Flow Projections: Base Case
We used Excel to do the analysis. We could have used a calculator and paper, but
Excel is much easier when dealing with realistic capital budgeting problems. You
don’t need to know Excel to understand our discussion, but if you plan to work in
finance—or, really, in any business field—you must know how to use Excel, so we
recommend that you open the Excel Tool Kit for this chapter and scroll through it
as the textbook explains the analysis.
Figure 11-1 shows the base-case inputs used in the analysis. For example, the cost
of required equipment to manufacture the water heaters is $3,400 and is shown in

Cell E47 (all dollar values in Figure 11-1 and in our discussion here are reported in
thousands, so the equipment actually costs $3,400,000). If you change the inputs in
Cells E47:E61, Excel will instantly generate revised cash flows and performance mea-
sures (shown in Figure 11-2). We report key results next to the inputs so it is easy to
see in real time the effects of changes in assumptions.
The input values from Figure 11-1 are used to calculate cash flows and perfor-
mance measures, as reported in Figure 11-2. Some values change each year, and we
report those in Rows 77 to 80. Annual unit sales are shown on Row 77, and they are
projected to grow at 4% per year. The annual sales prices per unit are shown on Row
78, variable costs per unit on Row 79, and nonvariable costs on Row 80. These values
are all projected to grow at the rates assumed in Part 1, and the annual values are
used in the cash flow forecast.
The initial investments at t = 0 are shown in Cells E83:E85. The initial equipment
cost of $3,400 is in Cell E83. Virtually all projects require working capital, and this
one is no exception. For example, raw materials must be purchased and replenished
each year as they are used. In Part 1 (Figure 11-1) we assume that GPC must have an
amount of net operating working capital on hand that is equal to 12.65% of the up-
coming year’s sales. As we explain below, projected sales in Year 1 are $6,380, so
there must be an initial investment in working capital of 12.65%($6,380) = $807;
this is shown in Cell E84.4 There are no opportunity costs in the base-case scenario,
so the entry in Cell E85 is zero.
Unit sales and sales prices are multiplied to find the projected sales revenues
shown on Row 87. Variable costs per unit multiplied by the number of units gives
us total variable costs, as shown on Row 88. Nonvariable costs are shown on Row
89, and depreciation is on Row 90 (we explain the depreciation expense later in this
section). Subtracting variable costs, nonvariable costs, and depreciation from sales

revenues results in operating profit (EBIT), as shown on Row 91. We calculate taxes
on Row 92 and subtract them to get the project’s net operating profit after
taxes on Row 93. We add back depreciation on Row 94 because it is a noncash ex-
pense. There are no annual opportunity costs or cannibalization effects in the base-
case scenario; if there were, we would include them on an after-tax basis on Rows
95 and 96.
Because of the license, the project has a 4-year life; at Year 4, the equipment is
expected to have a salvage value of $300, which is shown in Cell I97. Because the

assets will be fully depreciated by Year 4, the $300 is a gain that is taxed at the firm’s
ordinary income tax rate of 40%; this tax is shown in Cell I98.5
Row 99 shows the annual changes in working capital. GPC will operate the proj-
ect with net working capital equal to 12.65% of the next year’s sales, so as sales grow,
the firm will have to increase its net working capital. These increases are shown as
negative numbers (investments) on Row 99, Years 1 through 3. Then, at the end of
Year 4, all of the investments in working capital will be recovered. Inventories will be
sold and not replaced, and all receivables will be collected by the end of Year 4. Total
net working capital recovered at t = 4 is the sum of the initial investment at t = 0,
$807, plus the additional investments during Years 1 through 3; the total is $963.
We sum Cells E83:E85 to get the total initial investment, and we sum Rows 93 to
99 to get the project’s annual net cash flows, set up as a time line on Row 101. These
cash flows are then used to calculate NPV, IRR, MIRR, PI, payback, and discounted
payback, performance measures that are shown in Cells C105 through C110. (The
results Columns H and I are based on straight-line depreciation and are discussed
later.) Based on this analysis, the project looks like it is barely breaking even, with
an NPV of only $36 as compared with an initial investment of over $4,200. Its IRR
and MIRR are both barely greater than the 10% WACC, the PI is barely greater
than 1.0, and the payback and discounted payback are almost as long as the project’s
life. However, before the decision is finalized, we need to look at some additional
factors. In particular, we must recognize that the actual outcome could be better or
worse than the base-case level, that there might be responses management can make
to changing conditions, and that there might be qualitative factors to consider. We
examine these concerns later in the chapter, but first we address the following issues
associated with the base-case analysis.
Depreciation
The depreciation expense is calculated as the annual rate allowed by the IRS multi-
plied by the project’s depreciable cost basis, which in this case is $3,400.6 Congress
sets the depreciation rates used for tax purposes, which are then used in capital bud-
geting. The rates for this project are shown on Row 116, and more details are pro-
vided in Appendix 11A and in the chapter’s Tool Kit. Congress permits firms to
depreciate assets using either the straight-line method or an accelerated method.
The results we have discussed thus far were based on accelerated depreciation. We
also analyzed the project using straight-line depreciation with the results reported in
Figure 11-2 in H105:H110; the full analysis is in the chapter’s Tool Kit. The results
indicate that the project is worth less when using straight-line depreciation than
when using accelerated depreciation. In general, profitable firms are better off using ac-
celerated depreciation because more depreciation is taken in the early years under the
accelerated method, so taxes are lower in those years and higher in later years. Total
depreciation, total cash flows, and total taxes are the same under both depreciation
methods, but receiving the cash earlier under the accelerated method results in a
higher NPV, IRR, and MIRR.
Suppose Congress wants to encourage companies to increase their capital expen-
ditures and thereby boost economic growth and employment. What changes in de-
5If an asset is sold for less than its book value, the resulting “negative” tax is a credit and would increase
the cash flow. If an asset is sold for exactly its book value, there will be no gain or loss and hence no tax
liability or credit.
6Regardless of whether accelerated or straight-line depreciation is used, the basis is not adjusted by the
salvage value when calculating the depreciation expense that is used to determine taxable income.

Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

preciation regulations would have the desired effect? The answer is “Make acceler-
ated depreciation even more accelerated.” For example, if GPC could write off
equipment at rates of 67%, 22%, 7%, and 4% rather than 33%, 45%, 15%, and
7%, then its early tax payments would be even lower, early cash flows would be
even higher, and the project’s NPV would exceed the value shown in Figure 11-2.7
Taxation of Salvage
In our example, GPC’s project was fully depreciated by the end of the project. But sup-
pose instead that GPC terminates operations before the equipment is fully depreciated.
The after-tax salvage value depends on the price at which GPC can sell the equipment
and on the book value of the equipment (i.e., the original basis less all previous deprecia-
tion charges). The following table shows the calculations of yearly book values.

Suppose GPC terminates at Year 2, at which time the book value is $748. We
consider two cases, gains and losses. In the first case, the salvage value is $898 and
so there is a reported gain of $898 −$748 = $150. This gain is taxed as ordinary in-
come, so the tax is 40%($150) = $60. The after-tax cash flow is equal to the sales
price less the tax: $898 −$60 = $838.
Now suppose the salvage value at Year 2 is only $98. In this case, there is a re-
ported loss: $98 −$748 = −$650. This is treated as an ordinary expense, so its tax is
40%(−$650) = −$260. This “negative” tax acts as a credit if GPC has other taxable
income, so the net after-tax cash flow is $98 −(−$260) = $358.
Externalities: Cannibalization or Complementary Projects
As noted earlier, the solar water heater project does not lead to any cannibalization
effects. Suppose, however, that it would reduce the net after-tax cash flows of another
GPC division by $50 per year and that no other firm could take on this project if
GPC turns it down. In this case, we would use the cannibalization line at Row 96,
deducting $50 each year. As a result, the project would have a lower NPV. On the
other hand, if the project would cause additional inflows to some other GPC division
because it was complementary to that other division’s products (i.e., if a positive ex-
ternality exists), then those after-tax inflows should be attributed to the water heater
project and thus shown as a positive inflow on Row 96.
Opportunity Costs
Now suppose the $3,400 initial cost were based on the assumption that the project
would use space in a building that GPC now owns and that the space could be leased
to another company for $200 per year, after taxes, if the project is rejected. The $200
7Indeed, this is exactly what Congress did in 2008 and 2009, in response to the global economic crisis, by
establishing a temporary “bonus” depreciation to stimulate investment. The depreciation in the first year
is the regular accelerated depreciation plus a bonus of 50% of the original basis. This feature of the tax
code is set to expire before this book will be printed, but Congress has extended the bonus once and
might extend it again.
Chapter 11: Cash Flow Estimation and Risk Analysis
433

would be an opportunity cost, and it should be reflected in our calculations. We would
subtract the $200 per year on Row 95, causing a decrease in NPV.
Sunk Costs.
Now consider a different example. Suppose GPC had spent $100,000 on
a marketing study for an oil pump project, and the study was inconclusive. If it abandons
the project without going forward, it would show a loss of $100,000. But suppose it
could go forward with an additional investment of $500,000, and suppose the NPV on
this incremental investment would be $50,000. In the final analysis, this project would
be a loser regardless of whether GPC stops or goes forward. With hindsight we can
see that the true “NPV” if we go forward would be the calculated NPV of $50,000 mi-
nus the $100,000 sunk cost, or $50,000 −$100,000 = −$50,000. A loss of $50,000 is bad,
but not as bad as a loss of $100,000, so GPC should go ahead with the oil pump project.
Other Changes to the Inputs
All of the input variables could be changed, and these changes would alter the calcu-
lated project cash flows and thus the NPV and other capital budgeting decision crite-
ria. We could increase or decrease the projected unit sales, the sales price, the
variable and/or the fixed costs, the initial investment cost, the net working capital re-
quirements, the salvage value, and even the tax rate if we thought Congress was likely
to raise or lower taxes. Such changes can be made easily in an Excel model, making it
possible to immediately see the resulting changes in the decision criteria. This is
called sensitivity analysis, and we discuss it in Section 11.5.
The Importance of Incorporating Expected Inflation
in Prices and Costs
Notice that the model has inputs for annual changes in prices and costs; in other
words, it allows for inflation (or deflation) in prices and costs. In Figure 11-2, we let
all prices and costs change by 2% annually to keep the example simple, but it is cer-
tainly possible that some items (such as energy costs) might experience higher infla-
tion than others (such as CPU prices), so our models always include separate line
items for the expected inflation in each price or cost. It is easy to overlook inflation,
but it is important to include it. For example, had we forgotten to include inflation in
the GPC example, then the estimated NPV would have dropped from +$36 to −$29.
Forgetting to include inflation in a capital budgeting analysis typically causes the es-
timated NPV to be lower than the true NPV, which could cause a company to reject
a project that it should have accepted.8
Self-Test
In what way is the setup for finding a project’s cash flows similar to the projected
income statements for a new, single-product firm? In what way would the two state-
ments be different?
Would a project’s NPV for a typical firm be higher or lower if the firm used acceler-
ated rather than straight-line depreciation? Explain.
How could the analysis in Figure 11-2 be modified to consider cannibalization,
opportunity costs, and sunk costs?
Why does net working capital appear with both negative and positive values in
Figure 11-2?
8The market’s estimate of expected inflation is already incorporated into the cost of debt (via the inflation
premium) and the cost of equity (via the risk-free rate in the CAPM), so the project’s cost of capital in-
cludes the effect of expected inflation. If you don’t also include the effect of inflation in projected cash
flows, then the cash flows will be too low relative to the cost of capital, leading to a downward-biased es-
timate of NPV.
434
Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

11.3 RISK ANALYSIS IN CAPITAL BUDGETING9
Projects differ in risk, and risk should be reflected in capital budgeting decisions.
There are three separate and distinct types of risk.
1. Stand-alone risk is a project’s risk assuming (a) that it is the firm’s only asset
and (b) that each of the firm’s stockholders holds only that one stock in his
portfolio. Stand-alone risk is based on uncertainty about the project’s expected
cash flows. It is important to remember that stand-alone risk ignores diversification
by both the firm and its stockholders.
2. Within-firm risk (also called corporate risk) is a project’s risk to the corpo-
ration itself. Within-firm risk recognizes that the project is only one asset
in the firm’s portfolio of projects; hence some of its risk is eliminated by
diversification within the firm. However, within-firm risk ignores diversification
by the firm’s stockholders. Within-firm risk is measured by the project’s impact
on uncertainty about the firm’s future total cash flows.
3. Market risk (also called beta risk) is the risk of the project as seen by a well-
diversified stockholder who recognizes (a) that the project is only one of the
firm’s projects and (b) that the firm’s stock is but one of her stocks. The project’s
market risk is measured by its effect on the firm’s beta coefficient.
Taking on a project with a lot of stand-alone and/or corporate risk will not
necessarily affect the firm’s beta. However, if the project has high stand-alone risk
and if its cash flows are highly correlated with cash flows on the firm’s other assets
and with cash flows of most other firms in the economy, then the project will
have a high degree of all three types of risk. Market risk is, theoretically, the most
relevant because it is the one that, according to the CAPM, is reflected in stock
prices. Unfortunately, market risk is also the most difficult to measure, primarily
because new projects don’t have “market prices” that can be related to stock mar-
ket returns.
Most decision makers do a quantitative analysis of stand-alone risk and then
consider the other two types of risk in a qualitative manner. Projects are classified
into several categories; then, using the firm’s overall WACC as a starting point, a
risk-adjusted cost of capital is assigned to each category. For example, a firm might
establish three risk classes and then assign the corporate WACC to average-risk
projects, add a 5% risk premium for higher-risk projects, and subtract 2% for low-
risk projects. Under this setup, if the company’s overall WACC were 10%, then 10%
would be used to evaluate average-risk projects, 15% for high-risk projects, and 8%
for low-risk projects. Although this approach is probably better than not making
any risk adjustments, these adjustments are highly subjective and difficult to justify.
Unfortunately, there’s no perfect way to specify how high or low the risk adjustments
should be.10
9Some professors may choose to cover some of the risk sections and skip others. We offer a range of
choices, and we tried to make the exposition clear enough that interested and self-motivated students can
read these sections on their own if they are not assigned.
10We should note that the CAPM approach can be used for projects provided there are specialized pub-
licly traded firms in the same business as that of the project under consideration. See the discussion in
Chapter 9 regarding techniques for measuring divisional betas.
For more on risk adjustments, see Tarun K. Mukherjee, “Reducing the Uncertainty-Induced Bias in
Capital Budgeting Decisions—A Hurdle Rate Approach,” Journal of Business Finance & Accounting, Sep-
tember 1991, pp. 747–753.

11.4 MEASURING STAND-ALONE RISK
A project’s stand-alone risk reflects uncertainty about its cash flows. The required dollars
of investment, unit sales, sales prices, and operating costs as shown in Figure 11-1
for GPC’s project are all subject to uncertainty. First-year sales are projected at 550 units
to be sold at a price of $11.60 per unit (recall that all dollar values are reported in
thousands). However, unit sales will almost certainly be somewhat higher or lower than
550, and the price will probably turn out to be different from the projected $11.50 per
unit. Similarly, the other variables would probably differ from their indicated values.
Indeed, all the inputs are expected values, not known values, and actual values can and do vary
from expected values. That’s what risk is all about!
Three techniques are used in practice to assess stand-alone risk: (1) sensitivity
analysis, (2) scenario analysis, and (3) Monte Carlo simulation. We discuss them in
the sections that follow.

What three techniques are used to assess stand-alone risk?
11.5 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Intuitively, we know that a change in a key input variable such as units sold or the
sales price will cause the NPV to change. Sensitivity analysis measures the percentage
change in NPV that results from a given percentage change in an input variable when other
inputs are held at their expected values. This is by far the most commonly used type of
risk analysis. It begins with a base-case scenario in which the project’s NPV is found
using the base-case value for each input variable. GPC’s base-case inputs were given
in Figure 11-1, but it’s easy to imagine changes in the inputs, and any changes would
result in a different NPV.
When GPC’s senior managers review a capital budgeting analysis, they are inter-
ested in the base-case NPV, but they always go on to ask a series of “what if” ques-
tions: “What if unit sales fall to 385?” “What if market conditions force us to price
the product at $8.12, not $11.60?” “What if variable costs are higher than we have
forecasted?” Sensitivity analysis is designed to provide answers to such questions.
Each variable is increased or decreased by a specified percentage from its expected
value, holding other variables constant at their base-case levels. Then the NPV is cal-
culated using the changed input. Finally, the resulting set of NPVs is plotted to show
how sensitive NPV is to changes in the different variables.
Figure 11-3 shows GPC’s project’s sensitivity graph for six key variables. The data
below the graph give the NPVs based on different values of the inputs, and those
NPVs were then plotted to make the graph. Figure 11-3 shows that, as unit sales
and the sales price are increased, the project’s NPV increases; in contrast, increases
in variable costs, fixed costs, equipment costs, and WACC lower the project’s NPV.
The slopes of the lines in the graph and the ranges in the table below the graph in-
dicate how sensitive NPV is to each input: The larger the range, the steeper the vari-
able’s slope and the more sensitive the NPV is to this variable. We see that NPV is
extremely sensitive to changes in the sales price; fairly sensitive to changes in variable
436

costs, units sold, and fixed costs; and not especially sensitive to changes in the equip-
ment’s cost and the WACC. Management should, of course, try especially hard to
obtain accurate estimates of the variables that have the greatest impact on the NPV.
If we were comparing two projects, then the one with the steeper sensitivity lines
would be riskier (other things held constant), because relatively small changes in the
input variables would produce large changes in the NPV. Thus, sensitivity analysis
provides useful insights into a project’s risk.11
Note, however, that even though
NPV may be highly sensitive to certain variables, if those variables are not likely to

11Sensitivity analysis is tedious with a regular calculator but easy with a spreadsheet. We used the chap-
ter’s Excel model to calculate the NPVs and then to draw the graph in Figure 11-3. To conduct such an
analysis by hand would be quite time-consuming, and if the basic data were changed even slightly—say,
the cost of the equipment was increased slightly—then all of the calculations would have to be redone.
With a spreadsheet, we can simply type over the old input with the new one, and presto, the analysis and
the graph change instantaneously.

change much from their expected values, then the project may not be very risky in
spite of its high sensitivity. Also, if several of the inputs change at the same time,
the combined effect on NPV can be much greater than sensitivity analysis suggests.
Tornado Diagrams
Tornado diagrams are another way to present results from sensitivity analysis. The first
step is to rank the range of possible NPVs for each of the input variables being changed.
In our example, the range for sales price per unit is the largest and the range for WACC
is the smallest. The ranges for each variable are then plotted, with the largest range on
top and the smallest range on the bottom. It is also helpful to plot a vertical line showing
the base-case NPV. We present a tornado diagram in Figure 11-4. Notice that the
diagram is like a tornado in the sense that it is widest at the top and smallest at the bot-
tom; hence its name. The tornado diagram makes it immediately obvious which inputs
have the greatest impact on NPV: sales price and variable costs.
NPV Break-even Analysis
A special application of sensitivity analysis is called NPV break-even analysis. In a
break-even analysis, we find the level of an input that produces an NPV of exactly
zero. We used Excel’s Goal Seek feature to do this. See Ch11 Tool Kit.xls on the
textbook’s Web site for an explanation of how to use this Excel feature.
Table 11-1 shows the values of the inputs discussed previously that produce a zero
NPV. For example, the number of units sold in Year 1 can drop to 547 before the
project’s NPV falls to zero. Break-even analysis is helpful in determining how bad
things can get before the project has a negative NPV.

Extensions of Sensitivity Analysis.
In our examples, we showed how one output,
NPV, varied with a change in a single input. Sensitivity analysis can easily be ex-
tended to show how multiple outputs, such as NPV and IRR, vary with a change in
an input. See Ch11 Tool Kit.xls on the textbook’s Web site for an example showing
how to use Excel’s Data Table feature to present multiple outputs.
It is also possible to use a Data Table to show how a single output, such as NPV,
varies for changes in two inputs, such as the number of units sold and the sales price
per unit. See Ch11 Tool Kit.xls on the textbook’s Web site for an example. However,
when we examine the impact of a change in more than one input, we usually use sce-
nario analysis, which is described in the following section.

What is sensitivity analysis?
Briefly explain the usefulness of a sensitivity graph.
Discuss the following statement: “A project may not be very risky in spite of its high
sensitivity to certain variables.”
11.6 SCENARIO ANALYSIS
In the sensitivity analysis just described, we changed one variable at a time. However,
it is useful to know what would happen to the project’s NPV if several of the inputs
turn out to be better or worse than expected, and this is what we do in a scenario
analysis. Also, scenario analysis allows us to assign probabilities to the base (or most
likely) case, the best case, and the worst case; then we can find the expected value of
the project’s NPV, along with its standard deviation and coefficient of variation, to get a
better idea of the project’s risk.
In a scenario analysis, we begin with the base-case scenario, which uses the most
likely value for each input variable. We then ask marketing, engineering, and other op-
erating managers to specify a worst-case scenario (low unit sales, low sales price, high
variable costs, and so on) and a best-case scenario. Often, the best and worst cases are
defined as having a 25% probability of occurring, with a 50% probability for the base-
case conditions. Obviously, conditions could take on many more than three values, but
such a scenario setup is useful to help get some idea of the project’s riskiness.
After much discussion with the marketing staff, engineers, accountants, and other
experts in the company, a set of worst-case and best-case values were determined for
several key inputs. Figure 11-5, taken from Tab 3 of the chapter Tool Kit model,
shows the probability and inputs assumed for the base-case, worst-case, and best-
case scenarios.

The project’s cash flows and performance measures under each scenario are calcu-
lated; see the Tool Kit for the calculations. The cash flows for each scenario are shown
in Figure 11-6, along with a probability distribution of the possible outcomes for
NPV. If the project is highly successful, then a low initial investment, high sales price,
high unit sales, and low production costs would combine to result in a very high NPV,
$13,379. However, if things turn out badly, then the NPV would be a negative $5,847.
This wide range of possibilities, and especially the large potential negative value, sug-
gests that this is a risky project. If bad conditions materialize, the project will not bank-
rupt the company—this is just one project for a large company. Still, losing $5,847
(actually $5,847,000, since the units are thousands of dollars) would certainly hurt the
company’s value and the reputation of the project’s manager.
If we multiply each scenario’s probability by the NPV for that scenario and then
sum the products, we will have the project’s expected NPV of $1,901, as shown in
Figure 11-6. Note that the expected NPV differs from the base-case NPV. This is not
an error—mathematically, they are not equal.12 We also calculate the standard devia-
tion of the expected NPV; it is $7,049. Dividing the standard deviation by the ex-
pected NPV yields the coefficient of variation, 3.71, which is a measure of stand-
alone risk. The firm’s average project has a coefficient of variation of about 0.50, so

12This result occurs because two uncertain variables, sales volume and sales price, are multiplied together
to obtain dollar sales, and this process causes the NPV distribution to be skewed to the right. A large
number multiplied by another large number produces a very big number, and this in turn causes the aver-
age value (or expected value) to increase.

Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

the 3.71 indicates that this project is much riskier than most of GPC’s other typical
projects.
GPC’s corporate WACC is 9%, so that rate should be used to find the NPV of an
average-risk project. However, the water heater project is riskier than average, so a
higher discount rate should be used to find its NPV. There is no way to determine
the “precisely correct” discount rate—this is a judgment call. Management decided to
evaluate the project using a 10% rate.13
Note that the base-case results are the same in our sensitivity and scenario analy-
ses, but in the scenario analysis the worst case is much worse than in the sensitivity
analysis and the best case is much better. This is because in scenario analysis all of
the variables are set at their best or worst levels, whereas in sensitivity analysis only
one variable is adjusted and all the others are left at their base-case levels.

13One could argue that the best-case scenario should be evaluated with a relatively low WACC, the
worst-case scenario with a relatively high WACC, and the base case with the average corporate WACC.
However, one could also argue that, at the time of the initial decision, we don’t know what case will occur
and hence a single rate should be used. Observe that, in the worst-case scenario, all of the cash flows are
negative. If we used a high WACC because of this branch’s risk, this would lower the PV of these nega-
tive cash flows, making the worst case much better than if we used the average WACC. Determining the
“right” WACC to use in the analysis is not an easy task!

The project has a positive NPV, but its coefficient of variation (CV) is 3.71, which
is almost 8 times higher than the 0.50 CV of an average project. With all that risk, it
is not clear if the project should be accepted or not. At this point, GPC’s CEO asked
the CFO to investigate the risk further by performing a simulation analysis, as de-
scribed in the next section.

What is scenario analysis?
Differentiate between sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. What advantage
does scenario analysis have over sensitivity analysis?
11.7 MONTE CARLO SIMULATION14
Monte Carlo simulation ties together sensitivities, probability distributions, and
correlations among the input variables. It grew out of work in the Manhattan Proj-
ect to build the first atomic bomb and was so named because it utilized the mathe-
matics of casino gambling. Although Monte Carlo simulation is considerably more
complex than scenario analysis, simulation software packages make the process man-
ageable. Many of these packages can be used as add-ons to Excel and other spread-
sheet programs.
In a simulation analysis, a probability distribution is assigned to each input
variable—sales in units, the sales price, the variable cost per unit, and so on. The
computer begins by picking a random value for each variable from its probability
distribution. Those values are then entered into the model, the project’s NPV is cal-
culated, and the NPV is stored in the computer’s memory. This is called a trial.
After completing the first trial, a second set of input values is selected from the input
variables’ probability distributions, and a second NPV is calculated. This process is
repeated many times. The NPVs from the trials can be charted on a histogram,
which shows an estimate of the project’s outcomes. The average of the trials’
NPVs is interpreted as a measure of the project’s expected NPV, with the standard
deviation (or the coefficient of variation) of the trials’ NPV as a measure of the pro-
ject’s risk.
Using this procedure, we conducted a simulation analysis of GPC’s solar water
heater project. To compare apples and apples, we focused on the same six variables
that were allowed to change in the previously conducted scenario analysis. We as-
sumed that each variable can be represented by its own continuous normal distribu-
tion with means and standard deviations that are consistent with the base-case
scenario. For example, we assumed that the units sold in Year 1 come from a normal
distribution with a mean equal to the base-case value of 550. We used the probabili-
ties and outcomes of the three scenarios to estimate the standard deviation (all calcu-
lations are in the Tool Kit). The standard deviation of units sold is 98, as calculated
using the scenario values. We made similar assumptions for all variables. In addition,
we assumed that the annual change in unit sales will be positively correlated with unit
sales in the first year: If demand is higher than expected in the first year, it will con-
tinue to be higher than expected. In particular, we assume a correlation of 0.65 be-
tween units sold in the first year and growth in units sold in later years. For all other
variables, we assumed zero correlation. Figure 11-7 shows the inputs used in the sim-
ulation analysis.
14This section is relatively technical, and some instructors may choose to skip it with no loss in
continuity.

Figure 11-7 also shows the current set of random variables that were drawn
from the distributions at the time we created the figure for the textbook. We
used a two-step procedure to create the random variables for the inputs. First, we
used Excel’s functions to generate standard normal random variables with a mean of 0
and a standard deviation of 1; these are shown in Cells E38:E51.15 To create the
random values for the inputs used in the analysis, we multiplied a random standard
normal variable by the standard deviation and added the expected value. For

example, Excel drew the value 0.57 for first-year unit sales (Cell E42) from a standard
normal distribution. We calculated the value for first-year unit sales to use in the
current trial as 550 + 98(0.57) = 606, which is shown in Cell F42.16
We used the inputs in Cells F38:F52 to generate cash flows and to calculate
performance measures for the project (the calculations are in the Tool Kit). For
the trial reported in Figure 11-7, the NPV is $1,595. We used a Data Table in
the Tool Kit to generate additional trials. For each trial, the Data Table saved the
value of the input variables and the value of the trial’s NPV. Figure 11-8 presents
selected results from the simulation for 5,000 trials. (The Tool Kit shows only 100
trials because simulating 5,000 trials reduces Excel’s speed when performing other
calculations in the worksheet.)
After running a simulation, the first thing we do is verify that the results are con-
sistent with our assumptions. The resulting sample mean and standard deviation of
units sold in the first year are 550 and 99, which are virtually identical to our assump-
tions in Figure 11-7. The same is true for all the other inputs, so we can be reason-
ably confident that the simulation is doing what we are asking.

THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
Are Bank Stress Tests Stressful Enough?
In late February of 2009, President Obama’s newly ap-
pointed financial team—consisting of leaders of the
Treasury,
the
Federal
Reserve,
and
the
FDIC—
announced that the 19 largest U.S. banks (including
Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America) would
have to undergo “stress tests.” If its test indicated that
a bank has a high probability of failure under possible
conditions, then it would be forced to raise new capital.
Investors would be reluctant to provide capital to a
bank deemed likely to fail, so the capital would have
to come from the Treasury. That would mean that the
U.S. government would then own most of the equity
and would control the bank, and the bank’s top man-
agers would likely be fired.
Just what is a stress test? In medicine, people are
connected to a device that monitors their heart, then
put on a treadmill, and then tested to see how well their
heart takes the stress of a brisk uphill jog. In engineer-
ing, beams are subjected to pressure to see how much
weight they can hold before breaking. In finance, sce-
nario and simulation analyses like those described in
this chapter are conducted to see what would happen
under unfavorable conditions. The “worst-case” sce-
nario we described earlier amounts to a stress test for
an individual project, and similar tests can be con-
ducted at the corporate level to answer questions like
this: “Could we make the required interest and principal
payments on our debt if sales fall by 50%?” Well-run
companies are constantly stress-testing projects, divi-
sions, and the entire corporation; then, as a result of
these tests, managers take actions such as rejecting
projects that are too risky or financing with stock rather
than debt.
Banks and other financial institutions have been lea-
ders in risk management, which includes stress-testing,
but as we know all too well, those tests failed in the
2008–2009 recession. Banks grossly underestimated
the combined effects of too much consumer and corpo-
rate debt, too much homebuilding, inadequate supervi-
sion of mortgage lenders, too many exotic derivatives
whose risks the bankers did not fully understand, and
so on. In a nutshell, banks throughout the world simply
failed to test and plan for the level of economic distress
that actually materialized, and the result was a melt-
down of the worldwide financial system.
Regulators today are determined not to let that situ-
ation occur again; hence the administration mandated
that the banks undergo stress tests under governmental
supervision. Some of the parameters that the banks
must test for include a 3.3% decline in GDP in 2009 fol-
lowed by no growth in 2010, an additional 22% decline
in housing prices, and a 10.3% unemployment rate by
2010. These conditions are worse than the consensus of
economic forecasters, but the economists were much
too optimistic in the months leading up to our current
plight. Indeed, a number of analysts think the govern-
ment’s stress test is not nearly stressful enough and
that, if “realistic” parameters were used, then most of
the large banks would fail. If such information were re-
leased, this would set off a panic that would make the
recession worse. Therefore, government officials have
announced that no banks will be declared to have
failed, just that they need more capital, and even that
information may not be released.
A stress test makes sense, but—as with all forecasting—
it may or may not do what it is supposed to do. This is true
in capital budgeting, and it is even truer for the hugely im-
portant job of bank regulation. A failure to develop accurate
forecasts of a project’s returns could hurt a manager’s
chances for promotion, but the failure to develop accurate
forecasts for our largest banks could do irreparable harm to
our entire nation.

outcomes.17 Figure 11-8 also reports a median NPV of −$51, which means that
half the time the project will have an NPV of less than −$51. In other words,
most of the time the project will lose money.
A picture is worth a thousand words, and Figure 11-8 shows the probability distribu-
tion of the outcomes. Note that the distribution of outcomes is skewed to the right. As
the figure shows, the potential downside losses are not as large as the potential upside
gains. Our conclusion is that this is a very risky project, as indicated by the coefficient of
variation, but it does have a positive expected NPV and the potential to be a “home run.”

11.8 PROJECT RISK CONCLUSIONS
We have discussed the three types of risk normally considered in capital budgeting:
stand-alone risk, within-firm (or corporate) risk, and market risk. However, two im-
portant questions remain: (1) Should firms care at all about stand-alone and corpo-
rate risk, given that finance theory says that market (beta) risk is the only relevant
risk? (2) What do we do when the stand-alone, within-firm, and market risk assess-
ments lead to different conclusions?
There are no easy answers to these questions. Strict adherents of the CAPM
would argue that well-diversified investors are concerned only with market risk, that
managers should be concerned only with maximizing stock price, and thus that mar-
ket (beta) risk ought to be given virtually all the weight in capital budgeting deci-
sions. However, we know that not all investors are well diversified, that the CAPM
does not operate exactly as the theory says it does, and that measurement problems
keep managers from having complete confidence in the CAPM inputs. In addition,
the CAPM ignores bankruptcy costs, even though such costs can be substantial, and
the probability of bankruptcy depends on a firm’s corporate risk, not on its beta risk.
Therefore, even well-diversified investors should want a firm’s management to give
at least some consideration to a project’s corporate risk, and that means giving some
consideration to stand-alone project risk.
Although it would be nice to reconcile these problems and to measure risk on
some absolute scale, the best we can do in practice is to estimate risk in a somewhat
nebulous, relative sense. For example, we can generally say with a fair degree of con-
fidence that a particular project has more, less, or about the same stand-alone risk as
the firm’s average project. Then, since stand-alone and corporate risk are generally
correlated, the project’s stand-alone risk is generally a reasonably good measure of
its corporate risk. Finally, assuming that market risk and corporate risk are corre-
lated, as is true for most companies, a project with a relatively high or low corporate
risk will also have a relatively high or low market risk. We wish we could be more
specific, but one simply must use a lot of judgment when assessing projects’ risks.
17Note that the standard deviation of NPV in the simulation is much smaller than the standard deviation
in the scenario analysis. In the scenario analysis, we assumed that all of the poor outcomes would occur
together in the worst-case scenario and that all of the positive outcomes would occur together in the
best-case scenario. In other words, we implicitly assumed that all of the risky variables were perfectly pos-
itively correlated. In the simulation, we assumed that the variables were independent (except for the corre-
lation between unit sales and growth). The independence of variables in the simulation reduces the range
of outcomes. For example, in the simulation, sometimes the sales price is high but the sales growth is low.
In the scenario analysis, a high sales price is always coupled with high growth. Because the scenario analy-
sis assumption of perfect correlation is unlikely, simulation may provide a better estimate of project risk.
However, if the standard deviations and correlations used as inputs in the simulation are inaccurately esti-
mated, then the simulation output will likewise be inaccurate.

In theory, should a firm be equally concerned with stand-alone, corporate, and mar-
ket risk? Would your answer be the same if we substituted “In practice” for “In the-

If a project’s stand-alone, corporate, and market risk are known to be highly corre-
lated, would this make the task of evaluating the project’s risk easier or harder?

Capital Budgeting Practices in the Asian/Pacific Region
A recent survey of executives in Australia, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore
asked several questions about companies’ capital bud-
geting practices. The study yielded the results summa-
rized below.
Techniques for Evaluating Corporate
Projects
Consistent with U.S. companies, most companies in
this region evaluate projects using IRR, NPV, and pay-
back. For IRR, usage ranges from 96% (in Australia) to
86% (in Hong Kong); NPV usage ranges from 96% (in
Australia) to 81% (in the Philippines); and payback us-
age ranges from 100% (in Hong Kong and the Philip-
pines) to 81% (in Indonesia).
Techniques for Estimating the Cost
of Equity Capital
Recall from Chapter 9 that three basic approaches can be
used to estimate the cost of equity: CAPM, dividend yield
plus growth (DCF), and cost of own debt plus a risk pre-
mium. The use of these methods varies considerably from
country to country (see Table A). The CAPM is used most
often by U.S. firms. This is also true for Australian firms,
but not for the other Asian/Pacific firms, which instead
more often use the DCF and risk premium approaches.
Techniques for Assessing Risk
Firms in the Asian/Pacific region rely heavily on sce-
nario and sensitivity analyses. They also use decision
trees and Monte Carlo simulation, but much less fre-
quently (see Table B).

11.9 REPLACEMENT ANALYSIS
In the previous sections we assumed that the solar water heater project was an en-
tirely new project, so all of its cash flows were incremental—they would occur if
and only if the project were accepted. However, for replacement projects we must
find the cash flow differentials between the new and old projects, and these differen-
tials are the incremental cash flows that we must analyze.
We evaluate a replacement decision in Figure 11-9, which is set up much like
Figures 11-1 and 11-2 but with data on both a new, highly efficient machine
(which will be depreciated on an accelerated basis) and data on the old machine
(which is being depreciated on a straight-line basis). In Part I we show the key in-
puts in the analysis, including depreciation on the new and old machines. In Part II

we find the cash flows the firm will have if it continues to use the old machine, and
in Part III we find the cash flows if the firm replaces the old machine. Then, in
Part IV, we subtract the old flows from the new to arrive at the incremental cash
flows, and we evaluate those flows in Part V to find the NPV, IRR, and MIRR.
Replacing the old machine appears to be a good decision.18
In some instances, replacements add capacity as well as lower operating costs. In
this case, sales revenues in Part III would be increased, and if that leads to a need for
more working capital, then this would be shown as a Time-0 expenditure along with
a recovery at the end of the project’s life. These changes would, of course, be re-
flected in the incremental cash flows on Row 52.
Self-Test
How are incremental cash flows found in a replacement analysis?
If you were analyzing a replacement project and suddenly learned that the old
equipment could be sold for $1,000 rather than $400, would this new information
make the replacement look better or worse? Explain.
In Figure 11-9 we assumed that output would remain stable if the old machine were
replaced. Suppose output would actually double. How would this change be dealt
with in the framework of Figure 11-9?
11.10 REAL OPTIONS
According to traditional capital budgeting theory, a project’s NPV is the present
value of its expected future cash flows, discounted at a rate that reflects the riskiness
of those cash flows. Note, however, that this says nothing about actions that can be
taken after the project has been accepted and placed in operation that might lead to
an increase in the cash flows. In other words, traditional capital budgeting theory as-
sumes that a project is like a roulette wheel. A gambler can choose whether or not to
spin the wheel, but once the wheel has been spun, nothing can be done to influence
the outcome. Once the game begins, the outcome depends purely on chance, and no
skill is involved.
Contrast roulette with a game such as poker. Chance plays a role in poker, and it
continues to play a role after the initial deal because players receive additional cards
throughout the game. However, poker players are able to respond to their oppo-
nents’ actions, so skilled players usually win.
Capital budgeting decisions have more in common with poker than roulette be-
cause (1) chance plays a continuing role throughout the life of the project, but
(2) managers can respond to changing market conditions and to competitors’ actions.
Opportunities to respond to changing circumstances are called managerial options
because they give managers a chance to influence the outcome of a project. They are
also called strategic options because they are often associated with large, strategic
projects rather than routine maintenance projects. Finally, they are called real op-
tions to differentiate them from financial options because they involve real, rather
than financial, assets. The following sections describe projects with several types of
embedded options.
18The same sort of risk analysis discussed in previous sections can be applied to replacement decisions.
One of our MBA graduates was hired as a financial analyst with a company that manufactured products
for sale to other businesses. He took our Excel replacement model, obtained input data from several of
his firm’s customers, and analyzed how his firm’s products would help the customers. In several cases, his
analysis helped nail down a sale. He then instructed the firm’s sales reps on how to use the model to stim-
ulate sales. This effort was highly successful, so our student got a nice bonus and was promoted in the
company.
Chapter 11: Cash Flow Estimation and Risk Analysis
449

Investment Timing Options
Conventional NPV analysis implicitly assumes that projects either will be accepted or
rejected, which implies they will be undertaken now or never. In practice, however,
companies sometimes have a third choice—delay the decision until later, when more
information is available. Such investment timing options can dramatically affect a
project’s estimated profitability and risk, as we saw in our example of GPC’s solar
water heater project.
Keep in mind, though, that the option to delay is valuable only if it more than off-
sets any harm that might result from delaying. For example, while one company de-
lays, some other company might establish a loyal customer base that makes it difficult
for the first company to enter the market later. The option to delay is usually most
valuable to firms with proprietary technology, patents, licenses, or other barriers to
entry, because these factors lessen the threat of competition. The option to delay is
valuable when market demand is uncertain, but it is also valuable during periods of
volatile interest rates, since the ability to wait can allow firms to delay raising capital
for a project until interest rates are lower.
Growth Options
A growth option allows a company to increase its capacity if market conditions are
better than expected. There are several types of growth options. One lets a company
increase the capacity of an existing product line. A “peaking unit” power plant illustrates
this type of growth option. Such units have high variable costs and are used to pro-
duce additional power only if demand, and thus prices, are high.
The second type of growth option allows a company to expand into new geographic
markets. Many companies are investing in China, Eastern Europe, and Russia even
though standard NPV analysis produces negative NPVs. However, if these develop-
ing markets really take off, the option to open more facilities could be quite valuable.
The third type of growth option is the opportunity to add new products, including
complementary products and successive “generations” of the original product. Auto
companies are losing money on their first electric autos, but the manufacturing skills
and consumer recognition those cars will provide should help turn subsequent gen-
erations of electric autos into money makers.
Abandonment Options
Section 11.11 estimates the value of an abandonment option for GPC’s solar water
heater project. The standard DCF analysis we first employed assumed that the assets
would be used over a specified economic life. But even though some projects must be
operated over their full economic life—in spite of deteriorating market conditions
and hence lower than expected cash flows—other projects can be abandoned. Smart
managers negotiate the right to abandon if a project turns out to be unsuccessful as a
condition for undertaking the project.
Note, too, that some projects can be structured so that they provide the option to
reduce capacity or temporarily suspend operations. Such options are common in the natu-
ral resources industry, including mining, oil, and timber, and they should be reflected
in the analysis when NPVs are being estimated.
Flexibility Options
Many projects offer flexibility options that permit the firm to alter operations de-
pending on how conditions change during the life of the project. Typically, either
450
Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

inputs or outputs (or both) can be changed. BMW’s Spartanburg, South Carolina,
auto assembly plant provides a good example of output flexibility. BMW needed the
plant to produce sports coupes. If it built the plant configured to produce only these
vehicles, the construction cost would be minimized. However, the company thought
that later on it might want to switch production to some other vehicle type, and that
would be difficult if the plant were designed just for coupes. Therefore, BMW de-
cided to spend additional funds to construct a more flexible plant: one that could pro-
duce different types of vehicles should demand patterns shift. Sure enough, things
did change. Demand for coupes dropped a bit and demand for sport-utility vehicles
soared. But BMW was ready, and the Spartanburg plant began spewing out hot-
selling SUVs. The plant’s cash flows were much higher than they would have been
without the flexibility option that BMW “bought” by paying more to build a more
flexible plant.
Electric power plants provide an example of input flexibility. Utilities can build
plants that generate electricity by burning coal, oil, or natural gas. The prices of
those fuels change over time in response to events in the Middle East, changing en-
vironmental policies, and weather conditions. Some years ago, virtually all power
plants were designed to burn just one type of fuel, because this resulted in the lowest
construction costs. However, as fuel cost volatility increased, power companies began
to build higher-cost but more flexible plants, especially ones that could switch from
oil to gas and back again depending on relative fuel prices.
Valuing Real Options
A full treatment of real option valuation is beyond the scope of this chapter, but there
are some things we can say. First, if a project has an embedded real option, then
management should at least recognize and articulate its existence. Second, we know
that a financial option is more valuable if it has a long time until maturity or if the
underlying asset is very risky. If either of these characteristics applies to a project’s
real option, then management should know that its value is probably relatively high.
Third, management might be able to model the real option along the lines of a deci-
sion tree, as we illustrate in the following section.

11.11 PHASED DECISIONS AND DECISION TREES
Up to this point we have focused primarily on techniques for estimating a project’s
risk. Although this is an integral part of capital budgeting, managers are just as inter-
ested in reducing risk as in measuring it. One way to reduce risk is to structure projects
so that expenditures can be made in stages over time rather than all at once. This
gives managers the opportunity to reevaluate decisions using new information and
then to either invest additional funds or terminate the project. This type of analysis
involves the use of decision trees.
The Basic Decision Tree
GPC’s analysis of the solar water heater project thus far has assumed that the project
cannot be abandoned once it goes into operation, even if the worst-case situation
arises. However, GPC is considering the possibility of terminating (abandoning) the
Chapter 11: Cash Flow Estimation and Risk Analysis
451

project at Year 2 if the demand is low. The net after-tax cash flow from salvage, legal
fees, liquidation of working capital, and all other termination costs and revenues is
$500. Using these assumptions, the GPC ran a new scenario analysis; the results are
shown in Figure 11-10, which is a simple decision tree.
1. Here we assume that, if the worst case materializes, then this will be recognized
after the negative Year-1 operating loss and GPC will abandon the project.
Rather than continue realizing negative cash flows in Years 2, 3, and 4, the com-
pany will shut down the operation and liquidate the project for $500 at t = 2.
Now the expected NPV rises from $1,901 to $2,226 and the CV declines from
3.71 to 3.01. So, securing the right to abandon the project if things don’t work
out raised the project’s expected return and lowered its risk. This will give you an
approximate value, but keep in mind that you may not have a good estimate of
the appropriate discount rate because the real option changes the risk, and hence
the required return, of the project.19
After the management team thought about the decision-tree approach, other ideas
for improving the project emerged. The marketing manager stated that for $100,000
she could undertake a study that would give the firm a better idea of demand for the
product, and the design engineer stated that he could build a prototype solar water
heater that could be used to gauge consumer reactions to the actual product, which
would provide even more information about the final demand and production costs.
This led the CEO to discuss with the local university the possibility of delaying a
final decision on the project until another type of analysis could be done, a full-
blown staged decision-tree analysis, which is shown in Figure 11-11.
Decision trees such as the one in Figure 11-11 are often used to analyze multi-
stage, or sequential, decisions. Each circle represents a decision point, also known as
a decision node. The dollar value to the left of each decision node represents the net
cash flow at that point, and the cash flows shown under t = 3, 4, 5, and 6 represent
the cash inflows if the project is pushed on to completion. Each diagonal line leads to
a branch of the decision tree, and each branch has an estimated probability. For ex-
ample, if the firm decides to “go” with the project at Decision Point 1, then it will

spend $100,000 on the marketing study.20 Management estimates that there is a 0.8
probability that the study will produce positive results, leading to the decision to make
an additional investment and thus move on to Decision Point 2, and a 0.2 probability
that the marketing study will produce negative results, indicating that the project
should be canceled after Stage 1. If the project is canceled, the cost to the company
will be the $100,000 spent on the initial marketing study.
If the marketing study yields positive results, then the firm will spend $500,000 on
the prototype water heater at Decision Point 2. Management estimates (even before
making the initial $100,000 investment) that there is a 45% probability of the pilot
project yielding good results, a 40% probability of average results, and a 15% proba-
bility of bad results. If the prototype works well, then the firm will spend several
millions more at Decision Point 3 to build a production plant, buy the necessary
inventory, and commence operations. The operating cash flows over the project’s
4-year life will be good, average, or bad, and these cash flows are shown under Years
3 through 6.
The column of joint probabilities in Figure 11-11 gives the probability of occur-
rence of each branch—and hence of each NPV. Each joint probability is obtained by
multiplying together all the probabilities on that particular branch. For example, the
probability that the company will, if Stage 1 is undertaken, move through Stages 2
and 3, and that a strong demand will produce the indicated cash flows, is (0.8)(0.45) =
0.36 = 36.0%. There is a 32% probability of average results, a 12% probability of
building the plant and then getting bad results, and a 20% probability of getting
bad initial results and stopping after the marketing study.

The last column in Figure 11-11 gives the product of the NPV for each branch
times the joint probability of that branch’s occurring, and the sum of these products
is the project’s expected NPV. Based on the expectations used to create Figure 11-11
and a cost of capital of 10%, the project’s expected NPV is $3,526, or $3.526 mil-
lion.22 In addition, the CV declines from 3.71 to 0.84, and the maximum anticipated
loss is a manageable −$555,000. At this point, the solar water heater project looked
good, and GPC’s management decided to accept it.
Note also that Figure 11-11 illustrates two types of real options. The first real option
in the example is a timing option: GPC can delay a decision to spend a large amount of
money until it obtains additional information about the likely success of the project. The
second real option is an abandonment option, where GPC has the option to abandon
the project if continuing with the operation would result in negative cash flows. The
analysis could also be extended to illustrate a real growth option. For example, if the
project is successful, the company may be able to extend the license, expand production
of this project, or develop another profitable solar project. Thus, an additional set of
branches might be extended out from Cell I134, where the company would invest in
one or more other projects that offer potentially high NPVs. If one or more promising
growth options can be identified, then the project’s expected NPV might be higher yet.
As this example shows, decision-tree analysis requires managers to explicitly artic-
ulate the types of risk a project faces and to develop responses to potential scenarios.
Note also that our example could be extended to cover many other types of decisions
and could even be incorporated into a simulation analysis. All in all, decision-tree
analysis is a valuable tool for analyzing project risks.23

What is a decision tree? A branch? A node?
If a firm can structure a project such that expenditures can be made in stages rather
than all at the beginning, how would this affect the project’s risk and expected NPV?
Explain.
Summary
In this chapter, we developed a framework for analyzing a project’s cash flows and its
risk. The key concepts covered are listed below.
•
The most important (and most difficult) step in analyzing a capital budgeting
project is estimating the incremental after-tax cash flows the project will
produce.
•
A project’s net cash flow is different from its accounting income. Project net
cash flow reflects (1) cash outlays for fixed assets, (2) sales revenues, (3) operating
costs, (4) the tax shield provided by depreciation, and (5) cash flows due to
changes in net working capital. A project’s net cash flow does not include interest
payments, since they are accounted for by the discounting process. If we de-
ducted interest and then discounted cash flows at the WACC, this would double-
count interest charges.
22As we mentioned concerning the abandonment option, the presence of the real options in Figure 11-11
might cause the discount rate to change.
23In this example we glossed over an important issue: the appropriate cost of capital for the project. Add-
ing decision nodes to a project clearly changes its risk, so we would expect the cost of capital for a project
with few decision nodes to have a different risk than one with many nodes. If this is so then the projects
should have different costs of capital. In fact, we might expect the cost of capital to change over time as
the project moves to different stages, since the stages themselves differ in risk.

Part 4: Projects and Their Valuation

•
In determining incremental cash flows, opportunity costs (the cash flows for-
gone by using an asset) must be included, but sunk costs (cash outlays that have
been made and that cannot be recouped) are not included. Any externalities
(effects of a project on other parts of the firm) should also be reflected in the
analysis. Externalities can be positive or negative and may be environmental.
•
Cannibalization is an important type of externality that occurs when a new
project leads to a reduction in sales of an existing product.
•
Tax laws affect cash flow analysis in two ways: (1) taxes reduce operating cash
flows, and (2) tax laws determine the depreciation expense that can be taken in
each year.
•
The incremental cash flows from a typical project can be classified into three
categories: (1) initial investment outlay, (2) operating cash flows over the
project’s life, and (3) terminal year cash flows.
•
Price level changes (inflation or deflation) must be considered in project
analysis. The best procedure is to build expected price changes into the cash flow
estimates. Recognize that output prices and costs for a product can decline over
time even though the economy is experiencing inflation.
•
The chapter illustrates both expansion projects, in which the investment gen-
erates new sales, and replacement projects, where the primary purpose of the
investment is to operate more efficiently and thus reduce costs.
•
We discuss three types of risk: Stand-alone risk, corporate (or within-firm)
risk and market (or beta) risk. Stand-alone risk does not consider diversification
at all; corporate risk considers risk among the firm’s own assets; and market risk
considers risk at the stockholder level, where stockholders’ own diversification is
considered.
•
Risk is important because it affects the discount rate used in capital budgeting; in
other words, a project’s WACC depends on its risk.
•
Assuming the CAPM holds true, market risk is the most important risk because
(according to the CAPM) it is the risk that affects stock prices. However, usually
it is difficult to measure a project’s market risk.
•
Corporate risk is important because it influences the firm’s ability to use
low-cost debt, to maintain smooth operations over time, and to avoid crises
that might consume management’s energy and disrupt its employees, customers,
suppliers, and community. Also, a project’s corporate risk is generally easier to
measure than its market risk; and, because corporate and market risks are gen-
erally thought to be correlated, corporate risk can often serve as a proxy for
market risk.
•
Stand-alone risk is easier to measure than either market or corporate risk. Also,
most of a firm’s projects’ cash flows are correlated with one another, and the
firm’s total cash flows are correlated with those of most other firms. These cor-
relations mean that a project’s stand-alone risk can generally be used as a proxy
for hard-to-measure market and corporate risk. As a result, most risk analysis in
capital budgeting focuses on stand-alone risk.
•
Sensitivity analysis is a technique that shows how much a project’s NPV will
change in response to a given change in an input variable, such as sales, when all
other factors are held constant.
•
Scenario analysis is a risk analysis technique in which the best- and worst-case
NPVs are compared with the project’s base-case NPV.
Chapter 11: Cash Flow Estimation and Risk Analysis
455

•
Monte Carlo simulation is a risk analysis technique that uses a computer to
simulate future events and thereby estimate a project’s profitability and riskiness.
•
The risk-adjusted discount rate, or project cost of capital, is the rate used to
evaluate a particular project. It is based on the corporate WACC, a value that is
increased for projects that are riskier than the firm’s average project and
decreased for less risky projects.
•
A decision tree shows how different decisions during a project’s life can affect
its value.
•
A staged decision-tree analysis divides the analysis into different phases. At
each phase a decision is made either to proceed or to stop the project. These
decisions are represented on the decision trees by circles and are called decision
nodes.
•
Opportunities to respond to changing circumstances are called real, or mana-
gerial, options because they give managers the option to influence the returns
on a project. They are also called strategic options if they are associated with
large, strategic projects rather than routine maintenance projects. Finally, they
are also called “real” options because they involve “real” (or “physical”) rather
than “financial” assets. Many projects include a variety of these embedded
options that can dramatically affect the true NPV.
•
An investment timing option involves the possibility of delaying major expen-
ditures until more information on likely outcomes is known. The opportunity to
delay can dramatically change a project’s estimated value.
•
A growth option occurs if an investment creates the opportunity to make other
potentially profitable investments that would not otherwise be possible. These
include (1) options to expand the original project’s output, (2) options to enter a
new geographical market, and (3) options to introduce complementary products
or successive generations of products.
•
An abandonment option is the ability to discontinue a project if the operating
cash flow turns out to be lower than expected. It reduces the risk of a project and
increases its value. Instead of total abandonment, some options allow a company
to reduce capacity or temporarily suspend operations.
•
A flexibility option is the option to modify operations depending on how con-
ditions develop during a project’s life, especially the type of output produced or
the inputs used.
•
The option value can be determined by comparing the project’s expected NPV
with and without the option. If an initial cost is required to obtain a real option,
then that cost can be compared to the calculated value of the option as a part of
the overall analysis.

current cost per case is $105. The firm is taxed at a rate of 34%. Both prices and
costs are expected to rise at a rate of 6% per year. The firm uses only equity, and it
has a cost of capital of 15%. Assume that cash flows consist only of after-tax profits,
since the spring has an indefinite life and will not be depreciated.
a. Should the firm accept the project? (Hint: The project is a perpetuity, so you
must use the formula for a perpetuity to find its NPV.)

Replacement Analysis
The Taylor Toy Corporation currently uses an injection-molding machine that was
purchased 2 years ago. This machine is being depreciated on a straight-line basis, and
it has 6 years of remaining life. Its current book value is $2,100, and it can be sold for
$2,500 at this time. Thus, the annual depreciation expense is $2,100/6 = $350 per
year. If the old machine is not replaced, it can be sold for $500 at the end of its useful
life.
Taylor is offered a replacement machine that has a cost of $8,000, an esti-
mated useful life of 6 years, and an estimated salvage value of $800. This
machine falls into the MACRS 5-year class, so the applicable depreciation rates
are 20%, 32%, 19%, 12%, 11%, and 6%. The replacement machine would per-
mit an output expansion, so sales would rise by $1,000 per year; even so, the new
machine’s much greater efficiency would reduce operating expenses by $1,500
per year. The new machine would require that inventories be increased by
$2,000, but accounts payable would simultaneously increase by $500. Taylor’s
marginal federal-plus-state tax rate is 40%, and its WACC is 15%. Should it
replace the old machine?

Madison Manufacturing is considering a new machine that costs $250,000 and would
reduce pre-tax manufacturing costs by $90,000 annually. Madison would use the
3-year MACRS method to depreciate the machine, and management thinks the ma-
chine would have a value of $23,000 at the end of its 5-year operating life. The
applicable depreciation rates are 33%, 45%, 15%, and 7%, as discussed in Appendix
11A. Working capital would increase by $25,000 initially, but it would be recovered

Replacement Analysis
The Everly Equipment Company purchased a machine 5 years ago at a cost of
$90,000. The machine had an expected life of 10 years at the time of purchase, and
it is being depreciated by the straight-line method by $9,000 per year. If the machine
is not replaced, it can be sold for $10,000 at the end of its useful life.
A new machine can be purchased for $150,000, including installation costs. Dur-
ing its 5-year life, it will reduce cash operating expenses by $50,000 per year. Sales
are not expected to change. At the end of its useful life, the machine is estimated to
be worthless. MACRS depreciation will be used, and the machine will be depreciated
over its 3-year class life rather than its 5-year economic life, so the applicable depre-
ciation rates are 33%, 45%, 15%, and 7%.
The old machine can be sold today for $55,000. The firm’s tax rate is 35%, and
the appropriate WACC is 16%.
a. If the new machine is purchased, what is the amount of the initial cash flow at
Year 0?
b. What are the incremental net cash flows that will occur at the end of Years 1
through 5?
c. What is the NPV of this project? Should Everly replace the old machine?

Replacement Analysis
The Balboa Bottling Company is contemplating the replacement of one of its bot-

value of $600,000 and a remaining useful life of 5 years. The firm does not expect
to realize any return from scrapping the old machine in 5 years, but it can sell it
now to another firm in the industry for $265,000. The old machine is being depreci-
ated by $120,000 per year, using the straight-line method.
The new machine has a purchase price of $1,175,000, an estimated useful life and
MACRS class life of 5 years, and an estimated salvage value of $145,000. The appli-
cable depreciation rates are 20%, 32%, 19%, 12%, 11%, and 6%. It is expected to
economize on electric power usage, labor, and repair costs, as well as to reduce the
number of defective bottles. In total, an annual savings of $255,000 will be realized if
the new machine is installed. The company’s marginal tax rate is 35%, and it has a
12% WACC.
a. What is the initial net cash flow if the new machine is purchased and the old one
is replaced?
b. Calculate the annual depreciation allowances for both machines, and compute
the change in the annual depreciation expense if the replacement is made.
c. What are the incremental net cash flows in Years 1 through 5?
d. Should the firm purchase the new machine? Support your answer.
e. In general, how would each of the following factors affect the investment
decision, and how should each be treated?
(1) The expected life of the existing machine decreases.
(2) The WACC is not constant but is increasing as Balboa adds more projects
into its capital budget for the year.

Risky Cash Flows
The Bartram-Pulley Company (BPC) must decide between two mutually exclusive
investment projects. Each project costs $6,750 and has an expected life of 3 years.
Annual net cash flows from each project begin 1 year after the initial investment is
made and have the following probability distributions:

BPC has decided to evaluate the riskier project at a 12% rate and the less risky

decision? If Project B’s cash flows were negatively correlated with gross domestic
product (GDP), would that influence your assessment of its risk?

SSC uses a cost of capital of 15% to analyze average-risk projects, 12% for low-risk
projects, and 18% for high-risk projects. These risk adjustments primarily reflect the

uncertainty about each project’s NPV and IRR as measured by their coefficients of
variation. The firm is in the 40% federal-plus-state income tax bracket.
a. What is the expected IRR for the X-ray scanner project? Base your answer on
the expected values of the variables. Also, assume the after-tax “profits” figure
that you develop is equal to annual cash flows. All facilities are leased, so depre-
ciation may be disregarded. Can you determine the value of σIRR short of actual
simulation or a fairly complex statistical analysis?
b. Assume that SSC uses a 15% cost of capital for this project. What is the project’s
NPV? Could you estimate σNPV without either simulation or a complex statisti-
cal analysis?
c. Show the process by which a computer would perform a simulation analysis for
this project. Use the random numbers 44, 17, 16, 58, 1; 79, 83, 86; and 19, 62, 6
to illustrate the process with the first computer run. Actually calculate the first-
run NPV and IRR. Assume the cash flows for each year are independent of cash
flows for other years. Also, assume the computer operates as follows: (1) A de-
velopmental cost and a project life are estimated for the first run using the first
two random numbers. (2) Next, sales volume, sales price, and cost per unit are
estimated using the next three random numbers and used to derive a cash flow
for the first year. (3) Then, the next three random numbers are used to estimate
sales volume, sales price, and cost per unit for the second year, hence the cash
flow for the second year. (4) Cash flows for other years are developed similarly,
on out to the first run’s estimated life. (5) With the developmental cost and the
cash flow stream established, NPV and IRR for the first run are derived and
stored in the computer’s memory. (6) The process is repeated to generate per-
haps 500 other NPVs and IRRs. (7) Frequency distributions for NPV and IRR
are plotted by the computer, and the distributions’ means and standard devia-
tions are calculated.

Decision Tree
The Yoran Yacht Company (YYC), a prominent sailboat builder in Newport, may
design a new 30-foot sailboat based on the “winged” keels first introduced on the
12-meter yachts that raced for the America’s Cup.
First, YYC would have to invest $10,000 at t = 0 for the design and model tank
testing of the new boat. YYC’s managers believe there is a 60% probability that this
phase will be successful and the project will continue. If Stage 1 is not successful, the
project will be abandoned with zero salvage value.
The next stage, if undertaken, would consist of making the molds and producing
two prototype boats. This would cost $500,000 at t = 1. If the boats test well, YYC
would go into production. If they do not, the molds and prototypes could be sold for
$100,000. The managers estimate the probability is 80% that the boats will pass test-
ing and that Stage 3 will be undertaken.
Stage 3 consists of converting an unused production line to produce the new de-
sign. This would cost $1 million at t = 2. If the economy is strong at this point, the
net value of sales would be $3 million; if the economy is weak, the net value would be
$1.5 million. Both net values occur at t = 3, and each state of the economy has a
probability of 0.5. YYC’s corporate cost of capital is 12%.
a. Assume this project has average risk. Construct a decision tree and determine the
project’s expected NPV.
b. Find the project’s standard deviation of NPV and coefficient of variation of
NPV. If YYC’s average project had a CV of between 1.0 and 2.0, would this
project be of high, low, or average stand-alone risk?

SPREADSHEET PROBLEM
(11-18)
Build a Model: Issues in
Capital Budgeting
Start with the partial model in the file Ch11 P18 Build a Model.xls on the textbook’s
Web site. Webmasters.com has developed a powerful new server that would be used
for corporations’ Internet activities. It would cost $10 million at Year 0 to buy the equip-
ment necessary to manufacture the server. The project would require net working capi-
tal at the beginning of a year in an amount equal to 10% of the year’s projected sales:
NOWC0 = 10%(Sales1). The servers would sell for $24,000 per unit, and Webmasters
believes that variable costs would amount to $17,500 per unit. After Year 1, the sales
price and variable costs will increase at the inflation rate of 3%. The company’s nonvari-
able costs would be $1 million at Year 1 and would increase with inflation.
The server project would have a life of 4 years. If the project is undertaken, it
must be continued for the entire 4 years. Also, the project’s returns are expected to
be highly correlated with returns on the firm’s other assets. The firm believes it
could sell 1,000 units per year.
The equipment would be depreciated over a 5-year period, using MACRS rates. The
estimated market value of the equipment at the end of the project’s 4-year life is $500,000.
Webmasters’ federal-plus-state tax rate is 40%. Its cost of capital is 10% for average-risk
projects, defined as projects with an NPV coefficient of variation between 0.8 and 1.2.
Low-risk projects are evaluated with a WACC of 8% and high-risk projects at 13%.
a. Develop a spreadsheet model, and use it to find the project’s NPV, IRR, and
payback.
b. Now conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine the sensitivity of NPV to changes in
the sales price, variable costs per unit, and number of units sold. Set these variables’
values at 10% and 20% above and below their base-case values. Include a graph in
your analysis.
c. Now conduct a scenario analysis. Assume that there is a 25% probability that best-case
conditions, with each of the variables discussed in part b being 20% better than its
base-case value, will occur. There is a 25% probability of worst-case conditions, with
the variables 20% worse than base, and a 50% probability of base-case conditions.
d. If the project appears to be more or less risky than an average project, find its risk-
adjusted NPV, IRR, and payback.
e. On the basis of information in the problem, would you recommend that the project be
accepted?
Mini Case
Shrieves Casting Company is considering adding a new line to its product mix, and the capital
budgeting analysis is being conducted by Sidney Johnson, a recently graduated MBA. The
production line would be set up in unused space in Shrieves’s main plant. The machinery’s in-
voice price would be approximately $200,000, another $10,000 in shipping charges would be
required, and it would cost an additional $30,000 to install the equipment. The machinery
has an economic life of 4 years, and Shrieves has obtained a special tax ruling that places the
equipment in the MACRS 3-year class. The machinery is expected to have a salvage value of
$25,000 after 4 years of use.
The new line would generate incremental sales of 1,250 units per year for 4 years at an in-
cremental cost of $100 per unit in the first year, excluding depreciation. Each unit can be sold
for $200 in the first year. The sales price and cost are both expected to increase by 3% per
year due to inflation. Further, to handle the new line, the firm’s net working capital would
have to increase by an amount equal to 12% of sales revenues. The firm’s tax rate is 40%,
and its overall weighted average cost of capital is 10%.

a. Define “incremental cash flow.”
(1) Should you subtract interest expense or dividends when calculating project cash
flow?
(2) Suppose the firm had spent $100,000 last year to rehabilitate the production line
site. Should this be included in the analysis? Explain.
(3) Now assume the plant space could be leased out to another firm at $25,000 per year.
Should this be included in the analysis? If so, how?
(4) Finally, assume that the new product line is expected to decrease sales of the firm’s
other lines by $50,000 per year. Should this be considered in the analysis? If so,
how?
b. Disregard the assumptions in part a. What is Shrieves’s depreciable basis? What are the
annual depreciation expenses?
c. Calculate the annual sales revenues and costs (other than depreciation). Why is it im-
portant to include inflation when estimating cash flows?
d. Construct annual incremental operating cash flow statements.
e. Estimate the required net working capital for each year and the cash flow due to in-
vestments in net working capital.
f. Calculate the after-tax salvage cash flow.
g. Calculate the net cash flows for each year. Based on these cash flows, what are the
project’s NPV, IRR, MIRR, PI, payback, and discounted payback? Do these indicators
suggest that the project should be undertaken?
h. What does the term “risk” mean in the context of capital budgeting; to what extent can
risk be quantified; and, when risk is quantified, is the quantification based primarily on
statistical analysis of historical data or on subjective, judgmental estimates?
i. (1) What are the three types of risk that are relevant in capital budgeting?
(2) How is each of these risk types measured, and how do they relate to one another?
(3) How is each type of risk used in the capital budgeting process?
j. (1) What is sensitivity analysis?
(2) Perform a sensitivity analysis on the unit sales, salvage value, and cost of capital for the
project. Assume each of these variables can vary from its base-case, or expected, value
by ±10%, ±20%, and ±30%. Include a sensitivity diagram, and discuss the results.
(3) What is the primary weakness of sensitivity analysis? What is its primary usefulness?
k. Assume that Sidney Johnson is confident in her estimates of all the variables that affect
the project’s cash flows except unit sales and sales price. If product acceptance is poor,
unit sales would be only 900 units a year and the unit price would only be $160; a
strong consumer response would produce sales of 1,600 units and a unit price of $240.
Johnson believes there is a 25% chance of poor acceptance, a 25% chance of excellent
acceptance, and a 50% chance of average acceptance (the base case).
(1) What is scenario analysis?
(2) What is the worst-case NPV? The best-case NPV?
(3) Use the worst-, base-, and best-case NPVs and probabilities of occurrence to find
the project’s expected NPV, as well as the NPV’s standard deviation and coefficient
of variation.
l. Are there problems with scenario analysis? Define simulation analysis, and discuss its
principal advantages and disadvantages.
m. (1) Assume Shrieves’s average project has a coefficient of variation in the range of 0.2 to
0.4. Would the new line be classified as high risk, average risk, or low risk? What
type of risk is being measured here?
(2) Shrieves typically adds or subtracts 3 percentage points to the overall cost of capital
to adjust for risk. Should the new line be accepted?
(3) Are there any subjective risk factors that should be considered before the final deci-
sion is made?

Tax Depreciation
Companies often calculate depreciation one way when figuring taxes and another way
when reporting income to investors: Many use the straight-line method for stock-
holder reporting (or “book” purposes), but they use the fastest rate permitted by law
for tax purposes. Under the straight-line method used for stockholder reporting, one
normally takes the cost of the asset, subtracts its estimated salvage value, and divides
the net amount by the asset’s useful economic life. For example, consider an asset
with a 5-year life that costs $100,000 and has a $12,500 salvage value; its annual
straight-line depreciation charge is ($100,000 −$12,500)/5 = $17,500. Note, how-
ever, as we stated earlier, salvage value is a factor in financial reporting but it is not
considered for tax depreciation purposes.
For tax purposes, Congress changes the permissible tax depreciation methods
from time to time. Prior to 1954, the straight-line method was required for tax pur-
poses, but in 1954 accelerated methods (double-declining balance and sum-
of-years’-digits) were permitted. Then, in 1981, the old accelerated methods were re-
placed by a simpler procedure known as the Accelerated Cost Recovery System
(ACRS). The ACRS system was changed again in 1986 as a part of the Tax Reform
Act, and it is now known as the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System
(MACRS); a 1993 tax law made further changes in this area.
Note that U.S. tax laws are complicated, and in this text we can provide only an over-
view of MACRS that will give you a basic understanding of the impact of depreciation
on capital budgeting decisions. Further, the tax laws change so often that the numbers
we present may be outdated before the book is even published. Thus, when dealing with
tax depreciation in real-world situations, current Internal Revenue Service (IRS) publica-
tions or individuals with expertise in tax matters should be consulted.
For tax purposes, the entire cost of an asset is expensed over its depreciable life.
Historically, an asset’s depreciable life was set equal to its estimated useful economic
life; it was intended that an asset would be fully depreciated at approximately the
same time that it reached the end of its useful economic life. However, MACRS to-
tally abandoned that practice and set simple guidelines that created several classes of
assets, each with a more-or-less arbitrarily prescribed life called a recovery period or
class life. The MACRS class lives bear only a rough relationship to assets’ expected
useful economic lives.
A major effect of the MACRS system has been to shorten the depreciable lives of
assets, thus giving businesses larger tax deductions early in the assets’ lives and
thereby increasing the present value of the cash flows. Table 11A-1 describes the
types of property that fit into the different class life groups, and Table 11A-2 sets
forth the MACRS recovery allowance percentages (depreciation rates) for selected
classes of investment property.

Notes:
aWe developed these recovery allowance percentages based on the 200% declining balance method
prescribed by MACRS, with a switch to straight-line depreciation at some point in the asset’s life. For
example, consider the 5-year recovery allowance percentages. The straight-line percentage would be
20% per year, so the 200% declining balance multiplier is 2.0(20%) = 40% = 0.4. However, because the
half-year convention applies, the MACRS percentage for Year 1 is 20%. For Year 2, there is 80% of the
depreciable basis remaining to be depreciated, so the recovery allowance percentage is 0.40(80%) = 32%.
In Year 3, 20% + 32% = 52% of the depreciation has been taken, leaving 48%, so the percentage is
0.4(48%) ≈19%. In Year 4, the percentage is 0.4(29%) ≈12%. After 4 years, straight-line depreciation ex-
ceeds the declining balance depreciation, so a switch is made to straight-line (which is permitted under
the law). However, the half-year convention must also be applied at the end of the class life, and the re-
maining 17% of depreciation must be taken (amortized) over 1.5 years. Thus, the percentage in Year 5 is
17%/1.5 ≈11%, and in Year 6 it is 17% −11% = 6%. Although the tax tables carry the allowance percen-
tages out to two decimal places, we have rounded to the nearest whole number for ease of illustration.
See the worksheet 7. App. A in the file Ch11 Tool Kit.xls on the textbook’s Web site for the exact
recovery percentages specified by the IRS.
bResidential rental property (apartments) is depreciated over a 27.5-year life, whereas commercial
and industrial structures are depreciated over 39 years. In both cases, straight-line depreciation must be
used. The depreciation allowance for the first year is based, pro rata, on the month the asset was placed
in service, with the remainder of the first year’s depreciation being taken in the 28th or 40th year. A half-
month convention is assumed; that is, an asset placed in service in February would receive 10.5 months
of depreciation in the first year.

for all calculations.
Appendix 11A: Tax Depreciation
469

Consider Table 11A-1, which gives the MACRS class lives and the types of assets that
fall into each category. Property in the 27.5- and 39-year categories (real estate) must be
depreciated by the straight-line method, but 3-, 5-, 7-, and 10-year property (personal
property) can be depreciated either by the accelerated method set forth in Table 11A-2
or by the straight-line method.1
As we saw earlier in the chapter, higher depreciation expenses result in lower taxes
in the early years and hence lead to a higher present value of cash flows. Therefore,
since a firm has the choice of using straight-line rates or the accelerated rates shown
in Table 11A-2, most elect to use the accelerated rates.
The yearly recovery allowance, or depreciation expense, is determined by multi-
plying each asset’s depreciable basis by the applicable recovery percentage shown in
Table 11A-2. You might be wondering why 4 years of deprecation rates are shown
for property in the 3-year class. Under MACRS, the assumption is generally
made that property is placed in service in the middle of the first year. Thus, for
3-year-class property, the recovery period begins in the middle of the year the asset
is placed in service and ends 3 years later. The effect of the half-year convention is to
extend the recovery period out one more year, so 3-year-class property is depreciated
over 4 calendar years, 5-year property is depreciated over 6 calendar years, and so on.
This convention is incorporated into Table 11A-2’s recovery allowance percentages.2
Self-Test
What do the acronyms ACRS and MACRS stand for?
Briefly describe the tax depreciation system under MACRS.
1The Tax Code currently (for 2009) permits companies to expense, which is equivalent to depreciating
over 1 year, up to $125,000 of equipment; see IRS Publication 946 for details. This is a benefit primarily
for small companies. Thus, if a small company bought one asset worth up to $125,000, it could write the
asset off in the year it was acquired. This is called “Section 179 expensing.” We shall disregard this provi-
sion throughout the book. Also, Congress enacted the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002
following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. This act, among other things,
temporarily changed how depreciation is charged for property acquired after September 10, 2001, and be-
fore September 11, 2004, and put in service before January 1, 2005. We shall disregard this provision
throughout the book as well.
2The half-year convention also applies if the straight-line alternative is used, with half of one year’s de-
preciation taken in the first year, a full year’s depreciation taken in each of the remaining years of the as-
set’s class life, and the remaining half-year’s depreciation taken in the year following the end of the class
life. You should recognize that virtually all companies have computerized depreciation systems. Each as-
set’s depreciation pattern is programmed into the system at the time of its acquisition, and the computer
aggregates the depreciation allowances for all assets when the accountants close the books and prepare fi-
nancial statements and tax returns.

Financial Planning and
Forecasting Financial
Statements
A
recent survey of CFOs disclosed a paradox regarding financial
planning. On the one hand, almost all CFOs stated that financial
planning is both important and highly useful for allocating resources.
On the other hand, 45% also said that budgeting is “contentious, political,
and time-consuming,” and 53% went on to say that the budgeting process
can encourage undesirable behavior among managers as they negotiate
budgets to meet their own rather than the company’s objectives. Further,
they also said that instead of basing growth and incentive compensation
targets on an analysis of what markets and competitors are likely to do in
the future, firms often set their targets at last year’s levels plus a
percentage increase, which is dangerous in a dynamic economy.
To help resolve these issues, companies are developing a variety of
new strategies. For example, demand-pull budgeting links the budget to a
sales forecast, and the sales forecast is updated as needed to reflect
changing economic conditions. This approach is often augmented with a
rolling forecast, in which companies make 1- and 5-year forecasts but
then modify the 1-year forecast each month as new operating results
become available. Also, some companies have switched to activity-based
budgeting, which allocates costs and revenues by products and services
rather than by traditional departments.
A recent survey shows that high-performance companies also focus on
the links between forecasting, planning, and business strategy rather than
on just cost management and cost accounting. According to John
McMahan of the Hackett Group, such changes are leading to greater
forecasting accuracy, higher employee morale, and better corporate
performance. These issues are often thought of as “management” rather
than “finance,” but this is a false distinction. Much of finance is numbers-
oriented, but as any CFO will tell you, his or her primary job is to help the
firm as a whole achieve good results. The procedures discussed in this
chapter can help firms improve their operations and results.

Our primary objective in this book is to explain how financial managers can make their
companies more valuable. However, value creation is impossible unless the company has
well-designed strategic and tactical operating plans. As Yogi Berra once said, “You’ve got
to be careful if you don’t know where you’re going, because you might not get there.”
12.1 OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL PLANNING
Most companies have strategic plans, operating plans, and financial plans.
Strategic Plans
Strategic plans usually have statements for mission, corporate scope, corporate objec-
tives, and strategies.
Mission Statement.
Strategic plans usually begin with a mission statement, which is a
statement of the firm’s overall purpose. Many companies are very clear about their corpo-
rate mission, and for most this is typical: “Our mission is to maximize shareowner value
over time.” Before the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009, many companies forgot about
the “over time” part, focusing instead on “maximizing the stock price on the date the
CEO’s options vest.” Stockholders and directors have, fortunately, brought “over time”
back into focus.
Corporate Valuation and Financial Planning
The value of a firm is determined by the size, timing,
and risk of its expected future free cash flows (FCF).
This chapter explains how to project financial state-
ments and use them to calculate expected future free
cash flows under different operating plans. The next
chapter takes the analysis further, showing how to iden-
tify optimal plans and then design incentive compensa-
tion systems that will lead to optimal results.

Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

The goal of creating wealth for the company’s owners is not as common abroad as
it is in the United States. For example, Veba AG, one of Germany’s largest compa-
nies, created a stir when it made the following statement in its annual report: “Our
commitment is to create value for you, our shareholders.” This was quite different
from the usual German model, for German companies generally have representatives
from labor on their boards of directors and explicitly state their commitments to
labor and a variety of other stakeholders. As one might expect, Veba’s stock has con-
sistently outperformed the average German stock. As the trend in international
investing continues, more and more non-U.S. companies are adopting a corporate
purpose similar to that of Veba.
Corporate Scope.
A firm’s corporate scope defines its line or lines of business and
its geographic area of operations. For example, Coca-Cola limits its products to soft
drinks, but it operates on a global scale. PepsiCo followed Coke’s lead by spinning
off its food service businesses, as several studies have found that the market tends to
value focused firms more highly than diversified ones.1 During the bull market that
led up to the 2008–2009 crash, many companies expanded willy-nilly into things that
management knew little about, seeking sales growth as much or more than profits.
For example, electric utilities bought insurance companies, and conservative banks
bought gun-slinging mortgage companies. Those misguided ventures led to many
disasters, so today companies are paying more attention to having a reasonable cor-
porate scope.
Statement of Corporate Objectives.
This statement sets forth specific goals or
targets to help operating managers focus on the firm’s primary objectives. Most orga-
nizations have both quantitative and qualitative objectives. A typical quantitative objec-
tive might be attaining a 50% market share, a 20% ROE, and a 10% earnings growth
rate. Qualitatively, their stated objective might be: “To provide better information sys-
tems to lower the cost and improve the efficiency of the U.S. medical system.”
Corporate Strategies.
Once a firm has defined its purpose, scope, and objectives,
it must develop a strategy for achieving its goals. Corporate strategies are broad
approaches rather than detailed plans. For example, one airline may have a strategy
of offering no-frills service to a limited number of cities, while another’s strategy may
be to offer “a stateroom in the sky.” Any such strategy should, of course, be compat-
ible with the firm’s purpose, scope, and objectives.
Overall, the strategic plan provides a “vision” of what the firm’s top management
expects, and without such a vision, the firm is not likely to be successful.
Operating Plans
Operating plans provide detailed implementation guidance to help the firm realize its
strategic vision. These plans can be developed for any time horizon, but most com-
panies use a 5-year horizon, with the plan being quite detailed for the first year but
less and less specific for each succeeding year. The plan explains who is responsible
for each particular function, when specific tasks are to be accomplished, targets for
sales and profits, and the like. Large, multidivisional companies such as General Elec-
tric break their operating plans down by divisions, so each division has its own goals,
1See, for example, Philip G. Berger and Eli Ofek, “Diversification’s Effect on Firm Value,” Journal of
Financial Economics, January 1995, pp. 39–66; and Larry Lang and René Stulz, “Tobin’s Q, Corporate
Diversification, and Firm Performance,” Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 102, 1994, pp. 1248–1280.

mission, and plan for meeting its objectives. These plans are then consolidated to
form the overall corporate plan.
The Financial Plan
The financial planning process generally involves five steps.
1. The firm forecasts financial statements under alternative versions of the operating
plan in order to analyze the effects of different operating procedures on projected
profits and financial ratios.
2. Next, it determines the amount of capital that will be needed to support the plan;
that is, it finds out how much the new assets needed to achieve the target sales
will cost, since without adequate capital, the plan obviously cannot be realized.
3. Then the firm forecasts the funds that will be generated internally. If internal funds
are insufficient to cover the required new investment, then it must identify sources
from which the required external capital can be raised, taking account of any con-
straints due to bond covenants that limit its debt ratio and other financial ratios.
Market conditions must also be recognized. For example, in 2009 banks reduced
many firms’ lines of credit and also increased the fees and interest rates on such lines.
This surprised firms that were not keeping up with conditions in financial markets.
4. The firm establishes a performance-based management compensation system that
rewards employees for creating shareholder wealth. The emphasis here should be
on the long run, not on profits over the next few quarters or even years. A failure
in this area was perhaps the most important factor leading to the worldwide
financial and economic crisis that hit in 2008 and 2009.
5. Finally, management must monitor operations after implementing the plan to
spot any deviations and then take corrective actions. Computer software is help-
ing greatly here, and it’s changing the way companies do business. In particular,
corporate information systems are reducing the need for “middle managers” and
flattening firms’ management structures.
In the remainder of this chapter, we explain how to create a financial plan, including
its three key components: (1) the sales forecast, (2) forecasted financial statements, and
(3) methods for raising any needed external financing. Then, in Chapter 13, we discuss
in more detail the relationships among incentives, compensation, and performance.

this section.
12.2 SALES FORECAST
The sales forecast generally starts with a review of sales during the past 5 to 10 years,
expressed in a graph such as that in Figure 12-1. The first part of the graph shows 5 years
of historical sales for MicroDrive, the fictional firm we discussed in Chapters 2 and 3.
The graph could have contained 10 years of sales data, but MicroDrive typically focuses
on sales for the latest 5 years because its studies have shown that its future growth is
more closely related to recent events than to the distant past.
Entire courses are devoted to forecasting sales, so we only touch on the basic ele-
ments here. However, forecasting the future sales growth rate always begins with a
476
Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

look at past growth. MicroDrive’s recent annual growth rates have averaged 10.3%,
and the compound growth rate from 2006 to 2010 is the value for g in this equation:2
$2;058ð1þ gÞ4 ¼$3;000
The value of g can be found by solving the equation with a financial calculator. Enter
N = 4, PV = −2058, PMT = 0, and FV = 3000; then press I/YR to get g = 9.9%.3
No sensible manager would ever just forecast a continuation of past sales growth
without taking account of current conditions in both the national and global econo-
mies, the firm’s and its competitors’ new products, planned advertising programs,
and so on. But in the end, a sales forecast will emerge. In MicroDrive’s case, the con-
clusion is that sales are most likely to grow at a 10% rate. Note, though, that actual
sales could turn out to be materially higher or lower, depending on a number of fac-
tors that cannot be forecasted at this time.

If the sales forecast is off and the company does not have sufficient flexibility built
into its plans, the consequences could be serious. First, if the market expands by more
than MicroDrive has anticipated, the company will not be able to meet demand. Its
customers will end up buying competitors’ products, and MicroDrive will lose market
share that might be hard to regain. On the other hand, if its projections are overly
optimistic then it could wind up with too much plant, equipment, and inventory,
which would hurt its profits, free cash flow, and intrinsic stock value. Moreover, if
the firm had financed an expansion with debt, high interest charges and mandatory
debt repayments would compound its problem. Thus, an accurate sales forecast is
critical to the firm’s well-being. After much discussion and analysis, MicroDrive’s
managers decided that a 10% increase in sales was the most appropriate forecast.
The firm’s next questions include these: How much new capital will be needed to
fund the increased sales? Can this capital be raised internally, or will new external
funds be needed? And in view of current economic conditions, will it be feasible to
raise the needed capital? We answer these questions in the following sections using
two approaches: (1) the additional funds needed (AFN) method, and (2) the fore-
casted financial statements method.
Self-Test
List some factors that should be considered when developing a sales forecast.
Why is an accurate sales forecast critical to profitability?
12.3 ADDITIONAL FUNDS NEEDED (AFN) METHOD
MicroDrive is typical of most companies in that it expects growth in sales, which
means its assets also must grow. Asset growth requires additional funds, so the firm
may have to raise additional external capital if it has insufficient internal funds. If we
assume that none of the firm’s ratios will change (an assumption that we later mod-
ify), we can use a simple approach, the Additional Funds Needed (AFN) method,
to forecast financial requirements. The logic of the AFN approach is discussed in the
next few sections.
Required Increase in Assets
In a steady-state situation in which no excess capacity exists, the firm must have addi-
tional plant and equipment, more delivery trucks, higher inventories, and so forth if
sales are to increase. In addition, more sales will lead to more accounts receivable,
and those receivables must be financed from the time of the sale until they are col-
lected. Therefore, both fixed and current assets must increase if sales are to increase.
Of course, if assets are to increase, liabilities and equity must also increase by a like
amount to make the balance sheet balance.
Spontaneous Liabilities
The first sources of expansion funding are the “spontaneous” increases that will
occur in MicroDrive’s accounts payable and accrued wages and taxes. The company’s
suppliers give it 10 days to pay for inventory purchases, and since purchases will
increase with sales, accounts payable will automatically rise. For example, if sales rise
by 10% then inventory purchases will also rise by 10%, and this will cause accounts
payable to rise spontaneously by the same 10%. Similarly, because the company pays
workers every two weeks, more workers and a larger payroll will mean more accrued
wages payable. Finally, higher expected income will mean more accrued income taxes,
and its higher wage bill will mean more accrued withholding taxes. No interest nor-
mally is paid on these spontaneous funds, but their amount is limited by credit terms,
478
Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

contracts with workers, and tax laws. Therefore, spontaneous funds will thus be used to the
extent possible, but there is little flexibility in their usage.
Addition to Retained Earnings
The second source of funds for expansion comes from net income. Part of MicroDrive’s
profit will be paid out in dividends, but the remainder will be reinvested in operating
assets, as shown in the Assets section of the balance sheet; a corresponding amount will
be reported as an addition to retained earnings in the Liabilities and equity section of the
balance sheet. There is some flexibility in the amount of funds that will be generated
from new reinvested earnings because dividends can be increased or decreased, but if
the firm plans to hold its dividend steady or to increase it at a target rate, as most do,
then flexibility is limited.
Calculating Additional Funds Needed (AFN)
If we start with the required new assets and then subtract both spontaneous funds and
additions to retained earnings, we are left with the Additional Funds Needed, or AFN.
The AFN must come from external sources; hence it is sometimes called EFN. The typ-
ical sources of external funds are bank loans, new long-term bonds, new preferred
stock, and newly issued common stock. The mix of the external funds used should be
consistent with the firm’s financial policies, especially its target debt ratio.
Using MicroDrive’s Data to Implement the AFN Method

We see from Part II of Figure 12-3 that, for sales to increase by $300 million,
MicroDrive must increase assets by $200 million. Therefore, liabilities and capital
must also increase by $200 million. Of this total, $20 million will come from sponta-
neous liabilities, and another $61.58 million will come from new retained earnings.
The remaining $118.42 million must be raised from external sources—probably
some combination of short-term bank loans, long-term bonds, preferred stock, and
common stock.

Part II.  Additional Funds Needed (AFN) to Support Growth
Notes:
1. Under the assumed conditions, the firm must raise $118.42 million externally to support its planned growth.
However, the model assumes (1) that no excess capacity existed in 2010, so all assets were needed to produce
the indicated sales; and (2) that the key ratios will remain constant at their 2010 levels. We explain later how to relax
these assumptions, but it is better to use forecasted financial statements to deal with these issues, as we do on
Tab 2 of the Excel Tool Kit model.
2. Under the conditions set forth in Figure 12-3, a growth rate of 3.21% could be achieved without any AFN. This
3.21% is called the “sustainable growth rate,” and we explain how it is calculated in a later section and also in the
chapter’s Excel Tool Kit model.

Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

Key Factors in the AFN Equation
The AFN equation shows that external financing requirements depend on five key factors.
1. Sales growth (g). Rapidly growing companies require large increases in assets
and a corresponding large amount of external financing, other things held con-
stant. When capital is in short supply, as was the case during the financial crisis of
2009, companies may be forced to limit their growth.
2. Capital intensity (A0*/S0). The amount of assets required per dollar of sales,
A0*/S0, is the capital intensity ratio, which has a major effect on capital require-
ments. Companies with relatively high assets-to-sales ratios require a relatively large
amount of new assets for any given increase in sales; hence they have a greater need
for external financing. If a firm can find a way to lower this ratio—for instance, by
adopting a just-in-time inventory system, by going to two shifts in its manufacturing
plants, or by outsourcing rather than manufacturing parts—then it can achieve a
given level of growth with fewer assets and thus less new external capital.
3. Spontaneous liabilities-to-sales ratio (L0*/S0). If a company can increase its
spontaneously generated liabilities, this will reduce its need for external financing.
One way of raising this ratio is by paying suppliers in, say, 20 days rather than
10 days. Such a change may be possible but, as we shall see in Chapter 16, it
would probably have serious adverse consequences.
4. Profit margin (M = Net Income/Sales). The higher the profit margin, the
more net income is available to support increases in assets—and hence the less
the need for external financing. A firms’ profit margin is normally as high as
management can get it, but sometimes a change in operations can boost the sales
price or reduce costs, thus raising the margin further. If so, this will permit a
faster growth rate with less external capital.
5. Payout Ratio (POR = DPS/EPS). The less of its income a company distributes
as dividends, the larger its addition to retained earnings—and hence the less its
need for external capital. Companies typically like to keep their dividends stable
or to increase them at a steady rate—stockholders like stable, dependable divi-
dends, so such a dividend policy will generally lower the cost of equity and thus
maximize the stock price. So even though reducing the dividend is one way a
company can reduce its need for external capital, companies generally resort to
this method only if they are under financial duress.
The Self-Supporting Growth Rate
One interesting question is: “What is the maximum growth rate the firm could
achieve if it had no access to external capital?” This rate is called the “self-
supporting growth rate,” and it can be found as the value of g that, when used in
the AFN equation, results in an AFN of zero. We first replace ΔS in the AFN equa-
tion with gS0 and S1 with (1+g)S0 so that the only unknown is g; then we then solve
for g to obtain the following equation for the self-supporting growth rate:
Self-supporting g ¼
Mð1 −PORÞðS0Þ
A0  −L0  −Mð1 −PORÞðS0Þ
(12-2)
The definitions of the terms used in this equation are shown in Figure 12-3.
Chapter 12: Financial Planning and Forecasting Financial Statements
481

If the firm has any positive earnings and pays out less than 100% in dividends,
then it will have some additions to retained earnings, and those additions could be
combined with spontaneous funds to enable the company to grow at some rate
without having to raise external capital. As explained in the chapter’s Excel Tool
Kit, this value can be found either algebraically or with Excel’s Goal Seek function.
For MicroDrive, the self-supporting growth rate is 3.21%; this means it could
grow at that rate even if capital markets dried up completely, with everything else
held constant.
A Potential Problem with the AFN Equation:
Excess Capacity
As noted previously, when we use the AFN equation we are implicitly assuming
that the key ratios remain constant at their base-year levels. However, this
assumption may not always be true. For example, in 2010 many firms were oper-
ating at significantly less than their full capacity because of the recession. Let’s
suppose MicroDrive had been operating its fixed assets at only 50% of capacity.
It could then double its sales, which is a 100% increase, without adding any fixed
assets at all. Similarly, if it had 25% more inventories at the start of the year than
it required, it could increase sales by 25% without increasing its inventories. We
could adjust the AFN equation to account for excess capacity, and we explain
how to do so in the Tool Kit. However, a far better procedure is simply to
recognize that while the AFN is useful for quickly obtaining a “back of the enve-
lope” estimate of external financing requirements, the forecasted financial state-
ments method, which is explained in the next section, is vastly superior for
realistic financial planning.
Self-Test
If all ratios are expected to remain constant, an equation can be used to forecast
AFN. Write out the equation and briefly explain it.
Describe how do the following factors affect external capital requirements:
(1) payout ratio, (2) capital intensity, (3) profit margin.
In what sense do accounts payable and accruals provide “spontaneous funds” to a
growing firm?
Is it possible for the calculated AFN to be negative? If so, what would this imply?
Refer to data in the MicroDrive example presented, but now assume that MicroDrive’s
growth rate in sales is forecasted to be 15% rather than 10%. If all ratios remain
constant, what would the AFN be? ($205.62 million)
12.4 FORECASTED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS METHOD
As its name implies, the objective of the forecasted financial statements (FFS)
method is to project a complete set of financial statements. Because financial state-
ments contain numerous accounts, forecasting is almost always done using computer
software such as Excel. As you have probably experienced in your own spreadsheets,
there are many different ways to solve a particular problem, and this is also true when
forecasting financial statements. In fact, entire books have been written on the topic.4
In the following analysis, we explain one particular approach that we have found to
be effective, particularly for a company considering changes to its capital structures

or dividend policy.5 In addition, it is easy to modify this forecasting approach to
incorporate changes in assumptions.
Forecasting financial statements is conceptually similar to the AFN equation, but
it is easy to get lost in the details. Excel’s calculations don’t necessarily follow this
sequence, but keep these conceptual steps in mind as we describe MicroDrive’s fore-
casted financial statements.
1. Forecast the operating items on the income statement and balance sheet; these
include sales, costs, operating assets, and spontaneous operating liabilities. Notice
that these are the items required to calculate free cash flow.
2. Forecast items that depend on the firm’s choice of financial policies, such as the
dividend payout policy and the planned financing from debt and equity.
3. Forecast interest expense and preferred dividends, given the levels of debt and
preferred stock that were forecast according to the financing plan.
4. Use the forecasted interest expense and preferred dividends to complete the
income statement.
5. Determine the total common dividend payments.
6. Issue or repurchase additional common stock to make the balance sheets balance.
Forecasting is an iterative process. It begins with a set of initial operating assump-
tions and financial policies. The resulting forecasted statements are used to estimate
free cash flow, EPS, and financial ratios. Managers then go through a set of “what if”
questions and examine their operating assumptions and financial policies, as we de-
scribe next.
Background on the Company and the Forecast
MicroDrive’s board recently installed a new management team: a new CEO, CFO,
marketing manager, sales manager, inventory manager, and credit manager—only
the production manager was retained. The new team was charged with improving
the company’s performance. As we noted in Chapter 3, many of MicroDrive’s ratios
are below industry averages.
The management team met in late 2010, when the industry was in a recession, for
a 3-day retreat. The new CFO developed an Excel model to forecast financial state-
ments under several different sets of assumptions, or scenarios. The first scenario
assumes that operations maintain the status quo, the second that operations improve,
and the third that conditions deteriorate. During the 3-day meeting, the CFO devel-
oped a fourth scenario based on discussions among the managers regarding changes
that could be made to improve the firm’s performance. (We report the details of
these discussions in a later section.) They concluded that many changes could be
implemented almost immediately and that the effects of those changes would be
reflected in the 2011 results.
5One point about Excel models is worth noting. It is generally fairly easy to set up a model to study a
given issue, but the complexity of the model rises exponentially as you attempt to deal with more and
more different issues within the model. Therefore, in our experience it’s generally better to develop
limited-scope, single-issue models and then modify them to create new models—rather than trying to
develop one model that can “do everything.” Also, and crucially, it’s much easier to debug single-purpose
models than all-inclusive ones. Furthermore, if others are planning to use and perhaps modify the model,
it’s far easier for them to work with a simple model. There have been numerous occasions when we were
given a complex model, had a hard time understanding it, and then abandoned it to make our own model
that could do what we needed. These statements about “keeping it simple” are, of course, more appropri-
ate for time-constrained students than for business people.

as it had in 2010, except that its rate of sales growth increases from 5.26% to 10%.
Operating costs, operating assets, and operating spontaneous liabilities are assumed
to be the same percentage of sales in 2011 as in 2010. Depreciation is assumed to
be a fixed percentage of the net plant and equipment.
The components of MicroDrive’s investor-supplied capital are notes payable,
long-term bonds, preferred stock, and common equity. For this initial forecast, the
target proportions of these components as percentages of total investor-supplied cap-
ital are held constant. The interest rates on its debt and the dividend rate on its pre-
ferred stock are assumed to remain at 2010 levels. The payout ratio for total common
dividends is also assumed to stay at the 2010 level in the Status Quo scenario.
If additional financing is needed, it is assumed that new shares of common stock
can be issued at $23 per share, the 2010 year-end price. If a surplus of funds arises,
then MicroDrive will pay down some of its debt and repurchase shares of preferred
and common stock.
Inputs for the Best-Case Scenario.
The data in Column G are for the Best case.
Here the CEO assumes that MicroDrive is able to achieve industry average operating

results immediately. However, the CEO also assumes that the company continues to
use its current capital structure, which calls for more debt than the industry average.
The improved operating performance would lower the costs of debt and preferred
stock. However, the higher than average debt level would offset this factor to some
extent, so the end result would be somewhat higher than industry average cost rates
for notes payable, long-term debt, and preferred stock.
Inputs for the Worst-Case Scenario.
The data in Column H, the Worst case,
assume a continued long, bad recession, in which case the growth rate would be neg-
ative and the operating and financial ratios would be poor. It is likely that the stock
price would decline during the year, but the CFO assumes that new shares could still
have been issued at the beginning of the year for $23 per share, before investors and
managers learned how bad things were going to get.
Inputs for the Final Scenario.
The fourth set of input data, given in Column I
and called “Final,” was developed during the 3-day management conference held in
late 2010. All of the operating executives were there, and all aspects of the business
(including the ratios shown in Figure 12-4) were discussed. Some of the executives
were relatively optimistic while others were relatively pessimistic, but all tried their
best to be realistic. We will discuss these Final inputs in the next section.
Inputs for the Active Scenario.
Now look at Column E in Figure 12-4, the one
labeled “Active Scenario: Final.” With Excel’s Scenario Manager, you choose a sce-
nario and Excel replaces the input date in Column E with the data for the chosen
scenario (we had chosen the Final scenario when we created Figure 12-4, so that is
the scenario showing in Column E). These inputs are then linked to the section of
the spreadsheet where the financial statements are forecast. (The forecasted state-
ments are shown in Figure 12-5.)
After forecasting the financial statements, the model calculates performance mea-
sures, including the forecasted free cash flow (FCF), return on invested capital
(ROIC), EPS, ROE, number of shares at the end of the year, and DPS. These six
key results are shown in Figure 12-6; we will discuss them later.
Discussion of the Forecasted Operating Input Data
The CFO had taken a two-part computer course in college. The first module was
taught by a computer science expert who focused on the mechanics of programming
and computer usage in general. The second module was taught by an economist who
discussed how to apply computers to specific tasks, including various types of fore-
casting. The economist’s favorite term was GIGO, which stands for “garbage in, gar-
bage out,” and she repeated it constantly. No matter how well a model is set up, if
the inputs used aren’t accurate then the output won’t be accurate, either. The CFO
began the discussion by reminding the management team of this critical fact.
The sales growth rate is the first input item shown in Figure 12-4 and is followed
by the most important driver of profitability, the ratio of operating costs (excluding
depreciation) to sales. MicroDrive’s 2010 operating cost ratio was 87.21%, well above
the 83% industry average. This ratio is affected by operating costs, sales prices, and
unit sales, and it was discussed at length during the planning conference. The CFO
showed the forecasted results for the status quo, best-case, and worst-case scenarios,
after which the CEO led a discussion of what the firm could actually achieve in 2011.
After much discussion, the management team concluded that, because of licensing
fees and other costs, it was not feasible for the firm to achieve the industry average
operating cost ratio of 83% in the foreseeable future. However, the team believed
Chapter 12: Financial Planning and Forecasting Financial Statements
485

that a figure of 86%, down from 2010’s 87.21%, was “attainable.” They agreed that
over time it might be possible to reduce this ratio a bit further, but that 86% was the
most realistic choice to use in the forecast.
Intrinsic value is affected by many factors, including the level of inventory. If
MicroDrive carries too much inventory then storage costs, deterioration, and obso-
lescence will drive up operating costs. The CFO had studied the inventory/sales
ratio earlier and had pointed out that MicroDrive had almost twice as much inven-
tory for its sales as an average firm in the industry. The CEO stated that the produc-
tion, sales, and purchasing managers were jointly responsible for inventory in
MicroDrive’s supply chain. The managers said that they had already been working
on a plan to fix this problem. Because MicroDrive’s production facilities are farther
from their suppliers and customers than are those of most other firms in the industry,
MicroDrive must hold a higher than average level of inventory to avoid running out
of stock if sales surge. In the end, it was agreed that the inventory/sales ratio could be
lowered from 20.5% to 16%, a significant improvement but still above the 11.11%
industry average.
The CFO also pointed out that accounts receivable were much higher than the
industry average level. This meant that too much capital was tied up in receivables.
If a firm continues to sell to a customer who does not pay on time, the account bal-
ance will rise significantly, and if the customer then defaults, the selling firm will suf-
fer a larger bad debt loss than if it had stopped selling to the customer sooner. In
addition, collection costs rise with the amount of old receivables, which is another
reason to keep a tight rein on credit operations. During the discussion, the sales
manager noted that tightening its credit policy would lose the firm some sales. How-
ever, the lost sales would not be excessive, because most of the late-paying customers
were financially sound but were just taking advantage of the “float” MicroDrive was
giving them. After the discussion, the credit manager, sales manager, and treasurer
jointly agreed that it would be feasible to reduce the receivables/sales ratio to 11%
in 2011. That was still above the 9.8% industry average but below MicroDrive’s
2010 level of 12.5%. Therefore, 11% was built into the final forecast.
The CFO also brought up the net plant/sales ratio but noted that this ratio was in
line with the industry average—the production manager, who was not replaced dur-
ing the management change, had been forecasting sales accurately and holding equip-
ment purchases to the level actually required. This was facilitated by the outsourcing
of production to make up for shortfalls if more orders came during a given period
than had been expected. This smart use of outsourcing enabled the firm to operate
without carrying excess capacity in “normal” times in order to meet demand when
orders surged. Thus, the 2010 ratio of 33.3% for net plant and equipment to sales
was used in the forecast.
Financial Policy Issues
The discussion next turned to two key financial policies: capital structure and divi-
dends. The CFO noted that MicroDrive’s debt ratio was significantly above the in-
dustry average. This high leverage boosted ROE and EPS during good times, but it
also raised the interest rates for debt as well as the required return on common stock.
Further, an excessive amount of debt increased the risk of bankruptcy and reduced
the firm’s ability to maintain stable operations in times of stress. The treasurer noted
that the company’s banks were concerned about its high debt usage and that banks
nationwide were reducing the credit lines of companies deemed to have too much
debt. MicroDrive’s credit lines had not been reduced to date, but if the firm were
486
Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

to have even one bad quarter then a reduction might well occur, and that would be
devastating. Credit is the lifeblood of a business, and if its credit were curtailed then
MicroDrive might not be able to purchase supplies, pay workers, and so on, which
would be fatal. After this discussion, the decision was made to increase the common
equity ratio from its current 49.8% level of investor-supplied capital to 55.0%.6
The discussion then turned to dividend policy. In recent years, MicroDrive has
been increasing the dividend by about 8% per year, and the board of directors has
stated that it would like to continue this policy. However, the CFO recently disclosed
to the board that many companies that formerly increased their dividends at a steady
rate had re-examined that policy and had lowered the targeted rate of increase. An
8% annual increase during the long boom from the 1980s until 2008 had been feasi-
ble, but in the current and likely future economic climate a different policy might be
necessary. The CFO also pointed out that the average mature firm in the industry
was distributing about 40% of its earnings as dividends, compared with MicroDrive’s
50.7%. At the conclusion of this discussion, it was decided to use the 40% industry
average payout for the forecast, determine the resulting dividend per share, review
the resulting performance measures, and then discuss the recommended dividend
policy recommendation with the board. The CEO agreed with this plan but clearly
hoped that the forecast would support a dividend growth rate of 8% or more.
The next item discussed was the timing of new financing. The treasurer argued that it
would be best to issue any required new stock early in the year to ensure that these funds
would be available—stock prices are volatile, and the market for new stock could slam
shut later in the year. Also, if the firm raised equity early, that would make it easier to
issue new debt later. The CFO and CEO agreed, so the decision was made to sell any
required new stock early and to borrow throughout the year as needed.
A question was asked about the price at which new stock would be sold. The CFO
noted that the most recent price was $23 per share, and that was the most likely price
at which new shares could be sold early in the year. Interest rates on the existing debt
floated, moving up and down with rates in the general economy and the company’s
financial condition.7 The CFO thought interest rates probably would fluctuate to
some extent, but there was no more reason to believe that rates would go up than
go down. However, by mid-year the company’s own financial condition would be
known sufficiently well to influence its cost of debt. Therefore, as indicated in
Figure 12-4, the rates vary depending on the scenarios—low rates under good condi-
tions and high rates under bad conditions. The preferred dividend also floated, so its
rate also varied with the scenarios.
Based on an earlier back-of-the-envelope calculation using the AFN model, the
CFO had concluded that if operations improved significantly, the firm might not
need any new external funds and might even have a surplus. For example, if the profit
margin could be increased, this would lower external capital requirements. Even
more importantly, if the ratios of inventories and accounts receivable to sales could
be lowered, as the management team had discussed earlier, then this would greatly
reduce the need for new capital, especially during 2011. Those considerations
prompted the CEO to raise the following question: “If excess funds become available,
what should we do with them?” The CFO had actually considered several
6Capital structure decisions are discussed in detail in Chapter 15.
7All of the debt—both short-term bank loans and long-term bonds—had floating rates. The spread
between the bank loan rate and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) was based on the firm’s
coverage ratio (EBIT to interest charges). The long-term bond rate was determined similarly. The bank
loan rate was reset quarterly, and the long-term rate was reset every 6 months.

possibilities: (1) increase the dividend, (2) repurchase stock and repay debt in
amounts that would keep the capital structure constant, (3) invest excess funds in
marketable securities, or (4) embark on a merger program to acquire other firms.
They decided that the best alternative for modeling purposes was to simply use sur-
plus funds to repay debt and buy back stock. If the surplus was projected to extend on
into the long run, then a strategic decision would have to be made regarding what to
do with it, but that would require input from the board.
Debt could be repaid at book value and preferred stock repurchased at close to
book value. If the repurchase occurred early in the year, then it could probably be
bought at close to the current price. This brought up the question of when any sur-
plus funds would actually be available—would they be available early or late, or
would they come in regularly throughout the year? It might make sense to raise
new funds early, but excess funds could not be used until they were actually in hand,
and that would probably occur throughout the year. The decision was made to
repurchase stock early in the year and repay debt later in the year. The CFO also
planned to revisit this issue when developing the projected 2011 cash budget. (Cash
budgets are discussed in Chapter 16; they are typically done on a monthly basis.)
The Forecasted Financial Statements
Using input from the Final scenario as shown in column E of Figure 12-4, MicroDrive’s
forecasted financial statements (balance sheet and income statement) are reported
in Figure 12-5.8 The following points explain how to forecast the statements shown in
Figure 12-5.
1. Forecast next year’s sales based on the assumed growth rate: S2011 = S2010 × (1 + g).
2. Forecast each of the operating assets (cash, accounts receivable, inventories, and
net plant and equipment) and the spontaneous current liabilities (accounts pay-
able and accruals) as a percentage of forecasted sales. This completes the assets
section of the balance sheet and partially completes the liabilities section.
3. Use the forecasted operating data from Step 2 to calculate the required investor-
supplied capital, which is found as Total assets −(Accounts payable + Accruals).
4. Multiply the investor-supplied capital found in Step 3 by the inputs for the target
capital structure percentages shown in Figure 12-4 to forecast the amounts of
notes payable, long-term bonds, preferred stock, and total common equity. This
completes the balance sheet except for dividing the forecasted total common
equity into its two components, common stock and retained earnings.
5. Calculate operating costs as a percentage of forecasted sales and calculate depre-
ciation as a percentage of forecasted net plant and equipment. Subtract these
costs from sales to find EBIT.
6. It is assumed that new debt will be borrowed throughout the year, so interest
expenses will be based on the average amount of debt outstanding during the
year. This amount is equal to the average of the beginning-of-year debt and the
end-of-year debt forecast in Step 4. Multiply this average by the interest rate to
determine the forecasted interest expense. Observe that the income statement
shows separate lines for the interest expense due to notes payable and long-term
bonds—we find that we make fewer errors if we have more lines in a spreadsheet
but less complicated formulas in each cell.
8Columns E and I are identical in Figure 12-4. Excel’s Scenario Manager replaces the values in Column E
with the values shown in Column I when the Final scenario is selected. Similarly, the Scenario Manager
replaces data in Column E with the values shown in Columns F, G, or H when those scenarios are
selected.

7. Subtract interest expense from EBIT to find taxable income (EBT). Calculate
taxes and subtract them from EBT to get net income before preferred dividends.
8. Forecast preferred dividends in a similar manner as the forecasted interest
expense in Step 6: (1) find the average amount of preferred stock outstanding
during the year and then (2) multiply it by the preferred stock’s dividend rate.

9. Subtract the forecasted preferred dividends from the net income before preferred
dividends to find the net income available to common stockholders.
10. Multiply the net income by the target payout ratio to forecast the total amount of
common dividends paid. If net income is negative, set common dividends to zero.
11. Subtract common dividends from net income to find the addition to retained
earnings.
12. The forecasted total retained earnings shown on the balance sheet is equal to the
prior year’s retained earnings plus the addition to retained earnings calculated in
Step 11.
13. The forecasted total common stock must be equal to the difference between fore-
casted total common equity from Step 4 and the forecasted retained earnings bal-
ance from Step 12: Common stock = Total common equity −Retained earnings.
14. The required additional dollars of common stock issued or repurchased are equal
to the change in common stock: Additional dollars of stock issued or repurchased
= Common stock in 2011 −Common stock in 2010. If the amount is negative, it
means that stock will be repurchased rather than issued.
15. The number of new shares either issued or repurchased is equal to the addi-
tional dollars of common stock found in Step 14 divided by the price per
share. Because the stock is assumed to be sold at the beginning of 2011, the
assumed stock price is $23, the price at the end of 2010. We calculate this as:
Change in shares = (Additional dollars of common stock) ÷ (Stock price at the
beginning of the year).
16. The number of shares outstanding at the end of the year is equal to the number
of outstanding shares at the beginning of the year plus the change in the number
of shares calculated in Step 15.
Analyzing the Forecasted Results
After the Final set of inputs had been chosen, the CFO created a summary sheet
showing key results for the different scenarios, as shown in Figure 12-6. After pro-
jecting the key results on a big screen, the team discussed each of the scenarios.
Everyone dismissed the worst-case results, because if things started getting that bad
there would be an emergency meeting in which actions would be taken to modify the
plan. Similarly, the status quo and best-case results were given short shrift, and then
the team focused on the Final scenario results.
The jump in EPS looked good, and even with the assumed 40% payout ratio,
DPS rose by about 8%, which pleased the CEO.
The ROE improved nicely, rising from 12.7% to 15.7%, which exceeded the in-
dustry average. However, the CFO pointed out that the firm’s debt ratio, even after
the capital structure change, still exceeded the industry average, and that its greater
leverage was largely responsible for the above-average ROE.
Free cash flow was projected to make a tremendous improvement, from −$175
million in 2010 to +$209 million in 2011. The CFO noted, though, that a similar
improvement would not occur in the future, because most of the gain in free cash
flow was attributable to the one-time reduction in inventories and accounts receivable.
AFN, the last item in Figure 12-6, turned out to be negative, indicating that a surplus
of funds would exist in 2011 and for the same reason that free cash flow rose—the
reduction in inventories and accounts receivable. The lower payout and higher profit
margin also helped reduce the AFN, but the one-time reduction in inventories and
receivables was the key driver here.
490
Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

The forecasted statement of cash flows in Figure 12-7 tells a similar story: (1) cash
flow from operations is positive and large (with large cash flows resulting from im-
proved asset utilization; (2) cash flow from investments is negative because of the ex-
pansion in fixed assets needed to support growth; and (3) the cash flow from
financing activities shows that MicroDrive would be able to pay large dividends and
reduce its debt.
At the conclusion of the CFO’s summary, the CEO said that the firm would be in
great shape and that nice bonuses and stock options would result if the targets were
met and maintained over the long run.
Alternative Financial Policies and Multi-Year Forecasts
When the CEO and CFO presented the plan to the board of directors, the board was
pleased overall but had a few questions. Several board members, including the chair-
man and founder of the company, were concerned that the plan included issuing new
shares of common stock. They were also uneasy about the assumed price at which
shares of stock could be repurchased later in the year if there were surplus funds. In
addition, the board thought that determining dividends as a fixed percentage payout
of net income might introduce quite a bit of volatility in DPS. Because of these con-
cerns, the board asked the CFO to provide forecasted statements using the following
different assumptions regarding the financial policies.
For the purposes of this additional forecast, the board specified the following fi-
nancial policies: (1) let the regular DPS grow at a specified rate; (2) do not change
the level of existing notes payable; and (3) do not issue or repurchase bonds, pre-
ferred stock, or common stock. If additional financing is needed, the board suggested
forecasting the AFN as a draw against an existing line of credit on a temporary basis

a Unlike the AFN equation, the approach used to forecast the statements in these scenarios determines the
total amount of financing (the sum of notes payable, bonds, preferred stock, and common equity) rather than
the additional financing needed in comparison to the financing used in the most recent year. Therefore, the
additional financing needed is calculated directly from the changes in notes payable, bonds, preferred
stock, and common stock.

(even though the interest rate would be high) until the board could meet and decide
on a final financing plan. If instead a surplus of funds is available at the end of the
year, the board suggested that the surplus be paid to shareholders in the form of a
special dividend.9
The board asked to see two scenarios. The first is similar to the Status Quo scenario
previously discussed, except that the board’s three financial policies just described are
employed (the board suggested a zero growth rate for regular DPS). Because there is
no change in operating performance, this is called the Maintain scenario. The second
scenario is similar to the Final scenario discussed earlier, except that the board’s finan-
cial policy is applied (the board suggested an 8% growth in regular DPS for this sce-
nario). Because there are significant improvements in operating performance, this is
called the Improve scenario. The board asked to see the Maintain scenario first, which
is shown in Figure 12-8 (see Tab 3 in Ch12 Tool Kit.xls for details).
The operating items are forecasted in the same way as shown before. All liabilities
and equity accounts (except the line of credit) are planned in the sense that they are
specified by the financial policies. For the policies used here, there are no changes in
notes payable, bonds, or common stock; in addition, regular dividends are specified,
so the addition to retained earnings is specified. Column F in Figure 12-8 shows

these planned forecasts, but notice that the balance sheets don’t balance: The total
assets line equals $2,200, but total liabilities and equity sum only to $2,090.1. Thus,
there is a $2,200 −$2,090.1 = $109.9 million shortfall. In other words, the AFN is
$109.9, as shown in Row 118. Because additional financing is needed, there will be
an adjustment to the statements by borrowing $109.9 through the line of credit, as
shown in Column G. Because we assume that the borrowing occurs at the end of
the year, there will be no additional interest in this forecast. Column H shows the
forecasted statements after including the AFN.
Figure 12-9 reports the forecasted statements for the Improve scenario. The bal-
ance sheets in Column F again do not balance, but this is because there is more fi-
nancing (total liabilities and equity = $2,088.8) than assets (total assets = $1,999.2).
Thus, Row 118 shows a negative AFN, −$89.6 million. This will be paid out as a
special dividend, as shown in Column G. Column H reports the forecasted state-
ments after including the AFN.
The board expressed two additional concerns. First, they thought it unrealistic to
assume that the line of credit was only used on the last day of the year and thus
caused no additional interest expense. The board felt it would be more appropriate
to assume that the line of credit was accessed at regular intervals throughout the
year, which would lead to additional interest expense. The CFO explained that
when the AFN leads to additional interest expense it reduces net income, which re-
duces the addition to retained earnings and then increases the AFN, with the cycle
being repeated in a circular manner. This is called financing feedback, and there
are a variety of ways to incorporate feedback effects into the forecast. The CFO
agreed that adding debt throughout the year was a more realistic assumption but
said that the end-of-year assumption usually produced results fairly close to those
that incorporated feedback effects. However, the CFO agreed to incorporate financ-
ing feedback in the next set of forecasts, but rather than use valuable board time ex-
plaining feedback adjustments in detail, the CFO suggested that interested board
members take a look at Tab 4 in Ch12 Tool Kit.xls.
The board also wanted to see multi-year projections. After updating the forecast-
ing model to incorporate feedback effects and multi-year forecasts, the CFO returned
to the board meeting and presented the results shown in Figure 12-10. (See Tab 5 in
Ch12 Tool Kit.xls for calculations.)
The dramatic increase in FCF during 2011 would be a result of the improved op-
erations, including less inventory and fewer receivables. After this one-time improve-
ment, FCF drops in 2012 but then increases each year. The improved operations are
reflected in the increased return on invested capital, which in turn leads to strong
growth in EPS and thus enables growth in DPS. With the projected increase in the
times interest earned ratio and the decrease in the ratio of total liabilities to total as-
sets, the board discussed whether MicroDrive could support more debt. They de-
cided to discuss a possible recapitalization at their next meeting, in which
MicroDrive might issue bonds and use the proceeds to pay off the line of credit and
possibly repurchase shares of stock, topics we discuss in Chapter 14 and Chapter 15.
Self-Test
Is the AFN as calculated using the forecasted financial statements method, with all
the ratios held constant, the same (except for rounding errors) as the AFN found
using the AFN equation? Explain.
Why does the text argue that the forecasted financial statements method is prefera-
ble to the AFN equation method?
What does the acronym GIGO stand for? Is this important for forecasting?

12.5 FORECASTING WHEN THE RATIOS CHANGE
The AFN equation assumes that the ratios of assets and liabilities to sales (A0*/S0 and
L0*/S0) remain constant over time. This assumption can be relaxed when we use the
forecasted financial statement method, but in our forecast we made a one-time change
in these ratios and then held them constant thereafter. This implies that each “spontane-
ous” asset and liability item increases at the same rate as sales. In graph form, this implies
the type of relationship shown in Panel a of Figure 12-11, a relationship whose graph (1)
is linear and (2) passes through the origin. Under those conditions, if the company’s sales
increase from $200 million to $400 million, or by 100%, then inventory will also in-
crease by 100%, from $100 million to $200 million.
The assumption of constant ratios and identical growth rates is appropriate at
times, but there are times when it is incorrect. Three such conditions are described
in the following sections.
Economies of Scale
There are economies of scale in the use of many kinds of assets, and when economies
of scale occur, the ratios are likely to change over time as the size of the firm in-
creases. For example, retailers often need to maintain base stocks of different inven-
tory items even if current sales are quite low. As sales expand, inventories may then
grow less rapidly than sales, so the ratio of inventory to sales (I/S) declines. This sit-
uation is depicted in Panel b of Figure 12-11. Here we see that the inventory/sales
ratio is 1.5 (or 150%) when sales are $200 million but declines to 1.0 when sales
climb to $400 million.
The relationship in Panel b is linear, but nonlinear relationships often exist. In-
deed, if the firm uses one popular model for establishing inventory levels (the Eco-
nomic Ordering Quantity, or EOQ, model), its inventories will rise with the square
root of sales. This situation is shown in Panel c of Figure 12-11, which shows a

curved line whose slope decreases at higher sales levels. In this situation, very large
increases in sales would require very little additional inventory.10
Lumpy Assets
In many industries, technological considerations dictate that if a firm is to be compet-
itive, it must add fixed assets in large, discrete units; such assets are often referred to
as lumpy assets. In the paper industry, for example, there are strong economies of
scale in basic paper mill equipment, so when a paper company expands capacity, it
must do so in large, lumpy increments. This type of situation is depicted in Panel d
of Figure 12-11. Here we assume that the minimum economically efficient plant has
a cost of $75 million, and that such a plant can produce enough output to reach a

sales level of $100 million. If the firm is to be competitive, it simply must have at
least $75 million of fixed assets.
Lumpy assets have a major effect on the ratio of fixed assets to sales (FA/S) at dif-
ferent sales levels and, consequently, on financial requirements. At Point A in Panel
d, which represents a sales level of $50 million, the fixed assets are $75 million and
so the ratio FA/S = $75/$50 = 1.5. Sales can expand by $50 million, out to $100 mil-
lion, with no additions to fixed assets. At that point, represented by Point B, the ra-
tio FA/S = $75/$100 = 0.75. However, since the firm is operating at capacity (sales
of $100 million), even a small increase in sales would require a doubling of plant
capacity, so a small projected sales increase would bring with it a large financial
requirement.11
Excess Capacity Adjustments
If a firm has excess capacity, then sales can grow before the firm must add capacity.
The level of full capacity sales is
Full capacity sales ¼
Actual sales
Percentage of capacity at which
fixed assets were operated
(12-3)
For example, consider MicroDrive and use the data from its financial statements
in Figure 12-2, but now assume that excess capacity exists in fixed assets. Specifically,
assume that fixed assets in 2010 were being utilized to only 96% of capacity. If fixed
assets had been used to full capacity, then 2010 sales could have been as high as
$3,125 million versus the $3,000 million in actual sales:
Full capacity sales ¼
Actual sales
Percentage of capacity at which
fixed assets were operated
¼ $3;000 million
0:96
¼$3;125 million
The target fixed assets/sales ratio can be defined in terms of the full capacity
sales:
Target fixed assets=Sales ¼ Actual fixed assets
Full capacity sales
(12-4)
11Several other points should be noted about Panel d of Figure 12-11. First, if the firm is operating at a
sales level of $100 million or less, then any expansion that calls for a sales increase of more than $100 mil-
lion would require a doubling of the firm’s fixed assets. A much smaller percentage increase would be in-
volved if the firm were large enough to be operating a number of plants. Second, firms generally go to
multiple shifts and take other actions to minimize the need for new fixed asset capacity as they approach
Point B. However, these efforts can only go so far, and eventually a fixed asset expansion will be required.
Third, firms often make arrangements to share excess capacity with other firms in their industry. For ex-
ample, the situation in the electric utility industry is very much like that depicted in Panel d. However,
electric companies often build jointly owned plants, or else they “take turns” building plants, and then
they buy power from or sell power to other utilities to avoid building new plants that would be
underutilized.

Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

MicroDrive’s target fixed assets/sales ratio should be 32% rather than 33.3%:
Target fixed assets=Sales ¼ Actual fixed assets
Full capacity sales
¼ $1;000
$3;125 ¼ 0:32¼32%
The required level of fixed assets depends upon this target fixed assets/sales ratio:

(12-5)
Therefore, if MicroDrive’s sales increase to $3,300 million, its fixed assets would
have to increase to $1,056 million:
Required level
of fixed assets ¼
Target fixed assets
Sales


Projected
sales

¼ 0:32ð$3;300Þ ¼$1;056 million
We previously forecasted that MicroDrive would need to increase fixed assets at
the same rate as sales, or by 10%. That meant an increase of $100 million, from
$1,000 million to $1,100 million. Under the new assumptions, the actual required in-
crease in fixed assets is only from $1,000 million to $1,056 million, or $56 million.
Thus, the capacity-adjusted forecast is $100 −$56 = $44 million less than the earlier
forecast. With a smaller fixed asset requirement, the projected AFN would decline
from an estimated $118 million to $118 −$44 = $74 million.
Note also that when excess capacity exists, sales can grow to the capacity sales as
calculated above with no increase in fixed assets, but sales beyond that level would
require additions of fixed assets as in our example. The same situation could occur
with respect to inventories, and the required additions would be determined in ex-
actly the same manner as for fixed assets. Theoretically, the same situation could oc-
cur with other types of assets, but as a practical matter excess capacity normally exists
only with respect to fixed assets and inventories.

How do economies of scale and lumpy assets affect financial forecasting?
Summary
•
Financial forecasting generally begins with a forecast of the firm’s sales in terms
of both units and dollars.
•
Either the forecasted financial statements (FFS) method or the additional
funds needed (AFN) equation can be used to forecast financial requirements. If
conditions are likely to change, the financial statements method is more reliable,
and it also provides ratios and other data that can be used to evaluate alternative
business plans. The AFN equation is typically used to arrive at an approximation
for AFN.
•
A firm can determine its AFN by estimating the amount of new assets necessary
to support the forecasted level of sales and then subtracting from this amount the
spontaneous funds that will be generated from operations. The firm can then
plan how to raise the AFN most efficiently.
Chapter 12: Financial Planning and Forecasting Financial Statements
499

•
The higher a firm’s sales growth rate and the higher its payout ratio, the
greater will be its need for additional financing.
•
The greatest benefit of the forecasted financial statements method is its use in
planning to optimize operations and thereby increase the firm’s intrinsic
value and thus its stock price.
•
Adjustments must be made if economies of scale exist in the use of assets, if excess
capacity exists, or if growth must occur in large increments (lumpy assets).
•
Linear regression and excess capacity adjustments can be used to forecast
asset requirements in situations in which assets are not expected to grow at the
same rate as sales. See Web Extension 12A for more discussion of these issues.

The Barnsdale Corporation has the following ratios: A0*/S0 = 1.6; L0*/S0 = 0.4; profit
margin = 0.10; and dividend payout ratio = 0.45, or 45%. Sales last year were $100
million. Assuming that these ratios will remain constant, use the AFN equation to
determine the firm’s self-supporting growth rate—in other words, the maximum
growth rate Barnsdale can achieve without having to employ nonspontaneous exter-

Refer to Problem ST-1, and suppose Barnsdale’s financial consultants report (1) that the
inventory turnover ratio (sales/inventory) is 3, compared with an industry average of 4,
and (2) that Barnsdale could reduce inventories and thus raise its turnover ratio to 4
without affecting its sales, profit margin, or other asset turnover ratios. Under these con-

would require during each of the next 2 years if sales grow at a rate of 20% per year.

a. Assume that the company was operating at full capacity in 2010 with regard to all
items except fixed assets, which in 2010 were being utilized to only 75% of ca-
pacity. By what percentage could 2011 sales increase over 2010 sales without the

Baxter Video Products’s sales are expected to increase by 20% from $5 million in
2010 to $6 million in 2011. Its assets totaled $3 million at the end of 2010. Baxter
is already at full capacity, so its assets must grow at the same rate as projected sales.
At the end of 2010, current liabilities were $1 million, consisting of $250,000 of
accounts payable, $500,000 of notes payable, and $250,000 of accruals. The after-
tax profit margin is forecasted to be 5%, and the forecasted payout ratio is 70%.

At year-end 2010, Bertin Inc.’s total assets were $1.2 million and its accounts payable
were $375,000. Sales, which in 2010 were $2.5 million, are expected to increase by
25% in 2011. Total assets and accounts payable are proportional to sales, and that
relationship will be maintained. Bertin typically uses no current liabilities other than
accounts payable. Common stock amounted to $425,000 in 2010, and retained earn-
ings were $295,000. Bertin has arranged to sell $75,000 of new common stock in
2011 to meet some of its financing needs. The remainder of its financing needs will
be met by issuing new long-term debt at the end of 2011. (Because the debt is added
at the end of the year, there will be no additional interest expense due to the new
debt.) Its profit margin on sales is 6%, and 40% of earnings will be paid out as
dividends.

Sales for 2010 were $350 million and net income for the year was $10.5 million, so
the firm’s profit margin was 3.0%. Upton paid dividends of $4.2 million to common
stockholders, so its payout ratio was 40%. Its tax rate is 40%, and it operated at full
capacity. Assume that all assets/sales ratios, spontaneous liabilities/sales ratios, the
profit margin, and the payout ratio remain constant in 2011.

Describe how the self-supporting growth rate will change in response to each of
the following: (1) the profit margin declines, (2) the payout ratio increases, (3) the
capital intensity ratio declines.
c. Matthews’s management has reviewed its financial statements and arrived at two
possible scenarios for 2011. The first scenario assumes a steady state while the
second scenario, the target scenario, shows some improvement in ratios toward
industry average values. Forecasted values for the scenarios are shown in the
partially completed file Ch12 P11 Build a Model.xls. If Matthews assumes that
external financing is achieved through notes payable and that financing feedbacks
are not considered because the new notes payable are added at the end of the year,
then what are the firm’s forecasted AFN, EPS, DPS, and year-end stock price
under each scenario?
d. Matthews’s management realizes that interest for additional notes payable should
be included in the analysis. Assume that notes will be issued midway through the
year, so that interest on these notes is incurred for only half the year. If Matthews
assumes now that external financing is achieved through notes payable and if
financing feedbacks are considered, then what are the firm’s forecasted AFN,
EPS, DPS, and year-end stock price under each scenario?

FORECASTING THE FUTURE PERFORMANCE
OF ABERCROMBIE & FITCH
Clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch enjoyed phenomenal success in the late
1990s. Between 1996 and 2000, its sales grew almost fourfold, from $335 million to
more than $1.2 billion, and its stock price soared by more than 500%. More recently,
however, its growth rate has begun to slow down, and Abercrombie has had a hard
time meeting its quarterly earnings targets. As a result, the stock price in late 2002
was about half of what it was 3 years earlier. Abercrombie’s struggles resulted from
increased competition, a sluggish economy, and the challenges of staying ahead of
the fashion curve.
Since 2002, the company’s stock has rebounded strongly but questions remain about
the firm’s long-term growth prospects. Given the questions about Abercrombie’s future

Mini Case
Hatfield Medical Supplies’s stock price had been lagging its industry averages, so its board of
directors brought in a new CEO, Adam Lee. Lee asked for the company’s long-run strategic
plan; when he learned that no formal plan existed, he decided to develop one himself. Lee had
brought in Rick Novak, a finance MBA who had been working for a consulting company, to
replace the old CFO, and he asked Rick to develop the financial planning section of the stra-
tegic plan. In his previous job, Novak’s primary task had been to help clients develop financial
forecasts, and that was one reason Lee hired him.
Novak began as he always did, by comparing Hatfield’s financial ratios to the industry
averages. If any ratio was substandard, he discussed it with the responsible manager to see
what could be done to improve the situation. Figure MC-1 provides Hatfield’s latest financial
statements plus some ratios and other data that Novak plans to use in his analysis. Notice that
the figure is extracted from an Excel spreadsheet. Novak learned back in his university days
that, because of interactions among variables, any realistic financial forecast must be based on
a computer model. (The model is available to your instructor on the textbook’s Web site.) Of
course, he is also aware of the well-known computer axiom—garbage in, garbage out (GIGO).
Novak therefore plans to discuss the model’s inputs carefully with Hatfield’s operating man-
agers, individually and also collectively in the company’s financial planning conference.
a. Do you think Adam Lee should develop a strategic plan for the company? Why? What
are the central elements of such a plan? What is the role of finance in a strategic plan?
b. Given the data in Figure MC-1, how well run would you say Hatfield appears to be in
comparison with other firms in its industry? What are its primary strengths and weak-
nesses? Be specific in your answer, and point to various ratios that support your posi-
tion. Also, use the Du Pont equation (see Chapter 3) as one part of your analysis.
c. Use the AFN equation to estimate Hatfield’s required new external capital for 2011 if
the 15% expected growth takes place. Assume that the firm’s 2010 ratios will remain the
same in 2011.
d. Define the term capital intensity. Explain how a decline in capital intensity would affect
the AFN, other things held constant. Would economies of scale combined with rapid
growth affect capital intensity, other things held constant? Also, explain how changes
in each of the following would affect AFN, holding other things constant: the growth
rate, the amount of accounts payable, the profit margin, and the payout ratio.
508
Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

e. Define the term self-supporting growth rate. Based on the Figure MC-1 data, what is
Hatfield’s self-supporting growth rate? Would the self-supporting growth rate be af-
fected by a change in the capital intensity ratio or the other factors mentioned in ques-
tion d? Other things held constant, would the calculated capital intensity ratio change
over time if the company were growing and were also subject to economies of scale
and/or lumpy assets?
f. Forecast the financial statements for 2011 using the following assumptions. (1) Operat-
ing ratios remain unchanged. (2) No additional notes payable, LT bonds, or common

stock will be issued. (3) The interest rate on all debt is 10%. (4) If additional financing
is needed, then it will be raised through a line of credit. The line of credit would be
tapped on the last day of the year, so it would create no additional interest expenses
for that year. (5) Interest expenses for notes payable and LT bonds are based on the av-
erage balances during the year. (6) If surplus funds are available, the surplus will be paid
out as a special dividend payment. (7) Regular dividends will grow by 15%. (8) Sales will
grow by 15%. We call this the Steady scenario because operations remain unchanged.
1. How much new capital will the firm need (i.e., what is the forecasted AFN); how
does it compare with the amount you calculated using the AFN equation; and why
does any difference exist?

he year 2008 was a grim one for many companies, with the average
stock (as measured by the NYSE Composite Index) losing about 40%
of its value. There are only three possible explanations for this decline.
1.
The market price did not reflect intrinsic value—at the beginning of the year,
at the end of the year, or possibly both. In other words, the market might
have been overvalued in early 2008, undervalued at the end of 2008, or
both. This implies that investors were (and perhaps still are) irrational.
2.
Companies’ expected future free cash flows fell sharply when investors re-
vised their estimates downward as information about the pending economic
crisis unfolded.
3.
The cost of capital went up, which could have been due to an increase in
investors’ risk aversion.
These explanations aren’t mutually exclusive, so the explanation for the
market decline is likely some mix of the three reasons. Keep the stock
market’s performance in mind as you read the first half of this chapter,
which explains how the intrinsic values of a company and its stock are
determined.
The global economic crisis also has caused widespread attention on
corporate governance, with governments now taking ownership/leadership
positions at many companies ranging from Fannie Mae to Citigroup to
General Motors. As we write this, governments all over the world are
struggling to determine the type and degree of regulation that will prevent
future meltdowns yet still promote innovation. CEOs and board directors
are in the news daily, with many poorly performing CEOs being replaced
and many boards assuming additional responsibilities. There is a spotlight
on
executive
compensation,
with
the
federal
government
limiting
compensation to bailout recipients and Congress proposing laws to “claw
back” some compensation already paid. In summary, there is a worldwide
focus on corporate governance, so think about these examples when
reading the second half of this chapter.
511

As we have emphasized throughout the book, maximizing intrinsic value should
be management’s primary objective. However, to maximize value, managers need
a tool for estimating the effects of alternative strategies. In this chapter, we de-
velop and illustrate such a tool—the corporate valuation model, which is the
present value of expected future free cash flows discounted at the weighted aver-
age cost of capital. In a sense, the corporate valuation model is the culmination of
all the material covered thus far, because it pulls together financial statements,
cash flows, financial projections, time value of money, risk, and the cost of capi-
tal. Some companies practice value-based management by systematically using
the corporate valuation model to guide their decisions. The degree to which a
company employs principles of value-based management often depends on its
corporate governance, which is the set of laws, rules, and procedures that influ-
ence its operations and the decisions made by its managers. This chapter ad-
dresses all these topics, beginning with corporate valuation.
Corporate Valuation: Putting the Pieces Together
The intrinsic value of a firm is determined by the size,
timing, and risk of its expected future free cash flows
(FCF). Chapter 12 showed how to project financial state-
ments, and Chapter 2 showed how to calculate free
cash flows. Chapter 9 explained how to estimate the
weighted average cost of capital. This chapter puts the
pieces together and shows how to calculate the value of
a firm. It also shows how to use the valuation model as
a guide for choosing among different corporate strate-
gies and operating tactics.

Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

13.1 OVERVIEW OF CORPORATE VALUATION
As stated earlier, managers should evaluate the effects of alternative strategies on
their firms’ values. This really means forecasting financial statements under alterna-
tive strategies, finding the present value of each strategy’s cash flow stream, and then
choosing the strategy that provides the maximum value. The financial statements
should be projected using the techniques and procedures discussed in Chapter 12,
and the discount rate should be the risk-adjusted cost of capital as discussed in
Chapter 9. But what model should managers use to discount the cash flows? One
possibility is the dividend growth model from Chapter 7. However, that model is
often unsuitable for managerial purposes. For example, suppose a start-up company
is formed to develop and market a new product. Its managers will focus on product
development, marketing, and raising capital. They will probably be thinking about
an eventual IPO, or perhaps the sale of the company to a larger firm—Cisco,
Microsoft, Intel, IBM, or another of the industry leaders that buy hundreds of
successful new companies each year. For the managers of such a start-up, the deci-
sion to initiate dividend payments in the foreseeable future will be totally off the
radar screen. Thus, the dividend growth model is not useful for valuing most
start-up companies.
Also, many established firms pay no dividends. Investors may expect them to pay
dividends sometime in the future—but when, and how much? As long as internal op-
portunities and acquisitions are so attractive, the initiation of dividends will be post-
poned, and this makes the dividend growth model of little use. Even Microsoft, one
of the world’s most successful companies, paid no dividends until 2003.
Finally, the dividend growth model is generally of limited use for internal manage-
ment purposes, even for a dividend-paying company. If the firm consisted of just one
big asset and if that asset produced all of the cash flows used to pay dividends, then
alternative strategies could be judged through the use of the dividend growth model.
However, most firms have several different divisions with many assets, so the cor-
poration’s value depends on the cash flows from many different assets and on the
actions of many managers. These managers need a way to measure the effects of
their decisions on corporate value, but the discounted dividend model isn’t very use-
ful because individual divisions don’t pay dividends.
Fortunately, the corporate valuation model does not depend on dividends, and it
can be applied to divisions and subunits as well as to the entire firm.
Another important aspect of value-based management is the concept of corporate
governance. The corporate valuation model shows how corporate decisions affect
stockholders. However, corporate decisions are made by managers, not stockholders,
and maximizing shareholder wealth is not the same as individual managers maximiz-
ing their own “satisfaction.” Thus, a key aspect of value-based management is making
sure that managers focus on the goal of maximizing stockholder wealth. The set of
laws, rules, and procedures that influence a company’s operations and motivate its
managers falls under the general heading of corporate governance.
This chapter discusses the corporate valuation model, value-based management,
and corporate governance, beginning with the corporate valuation model.

13.2 THE CORPORATE VALUATION MODEL
There are two types of corporate assets: operating and nonoperating. Operating as-
sets, in turn, take two forms: assets-in-place and growth options. Assets-in-place
include such tangible assets as land, buildings, machines, and inventory as well as in-
tangible assets such as patents, customer lists, reputation, and general know-how.
Growth options are opportunities to expand that arise from the firm’s current oper-
ating knowledge, experience, and other resources. The assets-in-place provide an
expected stream of cash flows, and so do the growth options. For instance, Wal-Mart
has stores, inventory, widespread name recognition, a reputation for low prices, and
considerable expertise in business processes. These tangible and intangible assets pro-
duce current sales and cash flows, and they also provide opportunities for new invest-
ments that will produce additional cash flows in the future. Similarly, Merck owns
manufacturing plants, patents, and other real assets; it also has a knowledge base that
facilitates the development of new drugs and thus new cash flow streams.
Most companies also own some nonoperating assets, which come in two forms.
The first is a marketable securities portfolio over and above the cash needed to oper-
ate the business. For example, Ford Motor Company’s automotive operation held
about $9.2 billion in marketable securities at the end of December 2008, and this
was in addition to $6.4 billion in cash. Second, Ford also had $1.1 billion of invest-
ments in other businesses, which were reported on the asset side of the balance sheet
as “Equity in Net Assets of Affiliated Companies.” In total, Ford had $9.2 + $1.1 =
$10.3 billion of nonoperating assets, amounting to 14% of its $73.8 billion of total
automotive assets. For most companies, the percentage is much lower. For example,
as of the end of January, 2009, Wal-Mart’s percentage of nonoperating assets was less
than 1%, which is more typical.
We see, then, that for most companies operating assets are far more important
than nonoperating assets. Moreover, companies can influence the values of their
operating assets, whereas the values of nonoperating assets are largely beyond their
direct control. Therefore, value-based management—and hence this chapter—
focuses on operating assets.
Estimating the Value of Operations
Tables 13-1 and 13-2 contain the actual 2010 and projected 2011 to 2014 financial
statements for MagnaVision Inc., which produces optical systems for use in medical
photography. (See Chapter 12 for more details on how to project financial
statements.) Growth has been rapid in the past, but the market is becoming saturated,
so the sales growth rate is expected to decline from 21% in 2011 to a sustainable rate
of 5% in 2014 and beyond. Profit margins are expected to improve as the production
process becomes more efficient and because MagnaVision will no longer be incurring
marketing costs associated with the introduction of a major product. All items on the
financial statements are projected to grow at a 5% rate after 2014. Note that the
company does not pay a dividend, but it is expected to start paying out about 75%
of its earnings beginning in 2013. (Chapter 14 explains in more detail how companies
decide how much to pay out in dividends.)
Recall that free cash flow (FCF) is the cash from operations that is actually avail-
able for distribution to investors, including stockholders, bondholders, and preferred
stockholders. The value of operations is the present value of the free cash flows the
firm is expected to generate out into the future. Therefore, MagnaVision’s value can
be calculated as the present value of its expected future free cash flows from opera-
tions, discounted at its weighted average cost of capital (WACC), plus the value of its
514

nonoperating assets. Here is the equation for the value of operations, which is the
firm’s value as a going concern:

(13-1)
MagnaVision’s cost of capital is 10.84%. To find its value of operations as a going
concern, we use an approach similar to the nonconstant dividend growth model for
stocks in Chapter 7 and proceed as follows.
1. Assume that the firm will experience nonconstant growth for N years, after which
it will grow at some constant rate.
2. Calculate the expected free cash flow for each of the N nonconstant growth
years.
3. Recognize that growth after Year N will be constant, so we can use the constant
growth formula to find the firm’s value at Year N. This is the sum of the PVs for
year N + 1 and all subsequent years, discounted back to Year N.
4. Find the PV of the free cash flows for each of the N nonconstant growth years.
Also, find the PV of the firm’s value at Year N.

Notes:
aNet income is projected to decline in 2012. This is due to the projected cost for a one-time marketing program in that year.
b“Net interest” is interest paid on debt minus interest earned on marketable securities. Both items could be shown separately on
the income statements, but for this example we combine them and show net interest. MagnaVision pays more interest than it earns;
hence its net interest is subtracted.

5. Now sum all the PVs, those of the annual free cash flows during the nonconstant
period plus the PV of the Year-N value, to find the firm’s value of operations.
Figure 13-1 calculates free cash flow for each year, using procedures discussed in
Chapter 2. Line 1, with data for 2010 from the balance sheets in Table 13-2, shows
the required net operating working capital, or operating current assets minus operat-

Line 2 shows required net plant and equipment; Line 3, which is the sum of Lines 1

just operating capital. For 2010, operating capital is $212 + $279 = $491 million.
Line 4 shows the required annual addition to operating capital, found as the
change in operating capital from the previous year. For 2011, the required invest-
ment in operating capital is $560 −$491 = $69 million.

Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

Line 5 shows NOPAT, or net operating profit after taxes. Note that EBIT is operating
earnings before taxes, while NOPAT is operating earnings after taxes. Therefore,
NOPAT = EBIT(1 −T). With a 2011 EBIT of $85 million (as shown in Table 13-1)
and a tax rate of 40%, the NOPAT projected for 2011 is $51 million:
NOPAT ¼ EBITð1 −TÞ ¼ $85ð1:0 −0:4Þ ¼ $51 million
Although MagnaVision’s operating capital is projected to produce $51 million of
after-tax profits in 2011, the company must invest $69 million in new operating capi-
tal in 2011 to support its growth plan. Therefore, the free cash flow for 2011, shown
on Line 7, is a negative $18 million:
Free cash flow ðFCFÞ ¼ $51 −$69 ¼ −$18 million
This negative free cash flow in the early years is typical for young, high-growth compa-
nies. Even though net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) is positive in all years, free
cash flow is negative because of the need to invest in operating assets. The negative free
cash flow means the company will have to obtain new funds from investors, and the
balance sheets in Table 13-2 show that notes payable, long-term bonds, and preferred
stock all increase from 2010 to 2011. Stockholders will also help fund MagnaVision’s
growth—they will receive no dividends until 2013, so all of the net income from 2011
and 2012 will be reinvested. However, as growth slows, free cash flow will become posi-
tive, and MagnaVision plans to use some of its FCF to pay dividends beginning in 2013.1
A variant of the constant growth dividend model is shown as Equation 13-2. This
equation can be used to find the value of MagnaVision’s operations at time N, when its
free cash flows stabilize and begin to grow at a constant rate. This is the value of all
FCFs beyond time N, discounted back to time N (which is 2014 for MagnaVision):

1Magna Vision plans to increase its debt and preferred stock each year so as to maintain a constant capital
structure. We discuss capital structure in detail in Chapter 15.
Chapter 13: Corporate Valuation, Value-Based Management and Corporate Governance
517

Based on a 10.84% cost of capital, $49 million of free cash flow in 2014, and a 5%
growth rate, the value of MagnaVision’s operations as of December 31, 2014, is fore-
casted to be $880.99 million:

(13-2a)
This $880.99 million figure is called the company’s terminal, or horizon, value, be-
cause it is the value at the end of the forecast period. It is also sometimes called a
continuing value. It is the amount that MagnaVision could expect to receive if it
sold its operating assets on December 31, 2014.
Figure 13-2 shows the free cash flow for each year during the nonconstant growth
period along with the horizon value of operations in 2014. To find the value of op-
erations as of “today,” December 31, 2010, we find the PV of the horizon value and
each annual free cash flow in Figure 13-2, discounting at the 10.84% cost of capital:

The sum of the PVs is approximately $615 million, and it represents an estimate

day,” December 31, 2010.
Estimating the Price Per Share
The total value of any company is the value of its operations plus the value of its non-
operating assets.2 As the shown in the Table 13-2 balance sheet for December 31,

Vision has no such options.

Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

2010, MagnaVision had $63 million of marketable securities on that date. Unlike for
operating assets, we don’t need to calculate a present value for marketable securities
because short-term financial assets as reported on the balance sheet are at (or close
to) their market value. Therefore, MagnaVision’s total value on December 31, 2010, is
$615.27 + $63 = $678.27 million.
If the company’s total value on December 31, 2010, is $678.27 million, then what is the
value of its common equity? First, the sum of notes payable and long-term debt is $123 +
$124 = $247 million, and these securities have the first claim on assets and income.3 The
preferred stock has a claim of $62 million, and it also ranks above the common. Therefore,
the value left for common stockholders is $678.27 −$247 −$62 = $369.27 million.
Figure 13-3 is a bar chart that provides a breakdown of MagnaVision’s value. The
left bar shows the company’s total value as the sum of its nonoperating assets and its
value of operations. Next, the middle bar shows the claim of each class of investors
on that total value. Debtholders have the highest priority claim, and MagnaVision
owes $123 million on notes payable and $124 million on long-term bonds for a total
of $247 million. The preferred stockholders have the next claim, $62 million. The
remaining value belongs to the common equity, and it amounts to $678.27 −$247
−$62 = $369.27 million.4 This is MagnaVision’s intrinsic value of equity.

3Accounts payable and accruals were part of the calculation of FCF, so their impact on value is already
incorporated into the valuation of the company’s operations. It would be double-counting to subtract
them now from the value of operations.
4When estimating the intrinsic market value of equity, it would be better to subtract the market values of
debt and preferred stock rather than their book values. However, in most cases (including this one), the
book values of fixed-income securities are close to their market values. When this is true, one can simply
use book values.
Chapter 13: Corporate Valuation, Value-Based Management and Corporate Governance
519

In Chapter 2, we defined the Market Value Added (MVA) as the difference between
the market value of equity and the book value of equity capital supplied by shareholders.
Here we focus on the intrinsic MVA, which is the difference between the intrinsic
market value of stock and the book value of equity. The bar on the right side of Figure
13-3 divides the estimated market value of equity into these two components.
Figure 13-4 summarizes the calculations used to find MagnaVision’s stock value.
There are 100 million shares outstanding, and their total intrinsic value is $369.27
million. Therefore, the intrinsic value of a single share is $369.27/100 = $3.69.
The Dividend Growth Model Applied to MagnaVision
MagnaVision has not yet begun to pay dividends. However, as we saw in Table 13-1, a
cash dividend of $0.442 per share is forecasted for 2013. The dividend is expected to
grow by about 2.5% in 2014 and at a constant 5% rate thereafter. MagnaVision’s cost
of equity is 14%. In this situation, we can apply the nonconstant dividend growth
model as developed earlier in Chapter 7. Figure 13-5 shows that the value of Magna-
Vision’s stock, based on this model, is $3.70 per share, which is the same (except for a
rounding difference) as the value found using the corporate valuation model.5
Comparing the Corporate Valuation
and Dividend Growth Models
Because the corporate valuation and dividend growth models give the same answer,
does it matter which model you choose? In general, it does. For example, if you were
a financial analyst estimating the value of a mature company whose dividends are ex-
pected to grow steadily in the future, it would probably be more efficient to use the
dividend growth model. In this case you would need to estimate only the growth rate
in dividends, not the entire set of forecasted financial statements.
However, if a company is paying a dividend but is still in the high-growth stage of its
life cycle, you would need to project the future financial statements before you could
make a reasonable estimate of future dividends. Then, because you would have already
estimated future financial statements, it would be a toss-up as to whether the corporate
valuation model or the dividend growth model would be easier to apply. Intel, which
pays a dividend of about 52 cents per share on earnings of about $1.25 per share, is an
example of a company to which you could apply either model.

Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

Now suppose you were trying to estimate the value of a company that has never paid a
dividend, or a new firm that is about to go public, or a division that GE or some other large
company is planning to sell. In each of these situations there would be no choice: You
would have to estimate future financial statements and use the corporate valuation model.
Actually, much can be learned from the corporate valuation model even if a com-
pany is paying steady dividends; hence, many analysts today use it for all valuation
analyses. The process of projecting future financial statements can reveal quite a bit
about a company’s operations and financing needs. Also, such an analysis can provide
insights into actions that might be taken to increase the company’s value. This is the
essence of value-based management, which we discuss in the next section.6
Self-Test
Give some examples of assets-in-place, growth options, and nonoperating assets.
Write out the equation for the value of operations.
What is the terminal, or horizon, value? Why is it also called the continuing value?
Explain how to estimate the price per share using the corporate valuation model.
A company expects FCF of −$10 million at Year 1 and FCF of $20 million at Year 2;
after Year 2, FCF is expected to grow at a 5% rate. If the WACC is 10%, then what is
the horizon value of operations, Vop(Year 2)? ($420 million) What is the current value
of operations, Vop(Year 0)? ($354.55 million)
A company has a current value of operations of $800 million, and it holds $100 mil-
lion in short-term investments. If the company has $400 million in debt and has 10
million shares outstanding, what is the price per share? ($50.00)
13.3 VALUE-BASED MANAGEMENT
Bell Electronics Inc. has two divisions, Memory and Instruments, with total sales of
$1.5 billion and operating capital of $1.07 billion. Based on its current stock and
bond prices, the company’s total market value is about $1.215 billion, giving it an
MVA of $145 million: $1.215 −$1.070 = $0.145 billion = $145 million. Because it
has a positive MVA, Bell has created value for its investors. Even so, management is
considering several new strategic plans in its efforts to increase the firm’s value. All of
Bell’s assets are used in operations.

The Memory division produces memory chips for such handheld electronic de-
vices as cellular phones and PDAs (personal digital assistants), while the Instruments
division produces devices for measuring and controlling sewage and water treatment
facilities. Table 13-3 shows the latest financial results for the two divisions and for
the company as a whole.
As the table shows, Bell Memory is the larger of the two divisions, with higher
sales and more operating capital. Bell Memory is also more profitable, with a
NOPAT/Sales ratio of 7.9% versus 7.2% for Bell Instruments. This year, as in other
recent years, the focus of the initial strategic planning sessions was on the Memory
division. Bell Memory has grown rapidly because of the phenomenal growth in
consumer electronics, and this division rocketed past Instruments several years ago.
Although Memory’s growth has tapered off, senior management generally agreed
that this division should receive the lion’s share of corporate attention and resources
because it is larger, more profitable, and, frankly, more exciting. After all, Bell
Memory is associated with the glamorous market for telecommunications and
personal electronic devices, whereas Bell Instruments is associated with sewage
and sludge.
The financial assumptions and projections associated with the preliminary strate-
gic plans for the two divisions are shown in Tables 13-4 and 13-5. The initial strate-
gic plans project that each division will have 5% annual growth for the next 5 years
and thereafter. These plans also assume that the cost structures of the two
divisions will remain unchanged from the current year, 2010. Only partial financial
projections are shown in Tables 13-4 and 13-5. However, when Bell’s management
decides on a final strategic plan, it will develop complete financial statements for the
company as a whole and use them to determine financing requirements, as described
in Chapter 12.
To evaluate the plans, Bell’s management applied the corporate valuation model
to each division, thus valuing them using the free cash flow valuation technique.
Each division has a WACC of 10.5%, and Table 13-6 shows the results. The three
key items are NOPAT, the required investment in operating capital, and the result-
ing free cash flows for each year. In addition, the table shows each division’s horizon
value of operations at 2015, which is the end of the 5 years of explicit forecasts, as cal-
culated via Equation 13-2. The value of operations at 2010 is the present value of the
free cash flows and the horizon value, discounted at the weighted average cost of capi-
tal. As expected, Bell Memory has the greater value of operations, $709.6 million ver-
sus $505.5 million for Bell Instruments. However, the managers were surprised to see
that Bell Memory’s Market Value Added (MVA) is negative: $709.6 value of operations

7Earlier in this chapter we estimated MVA as the estimated value of equity minus the book value of
equity. We can also define MVA as
MVA = Total market value −Total capital
(see Chapter 2). By subtracting the value of any short-term investments from total market value, we get
the value of operations. If we subtract short-term investments from total capital, we get investor-supplied
operating capital. Therefore, MVA can be estimated as
MVA = Value of operations −Investor-supplied operating capital
Recall from Chapter 2 that investor-supplied operating capital is equal to total net operating capital, which
we also call total capital. Therefore, we can estimate MVA for a division or for a privately held company as
MVA = Value of operations −Total capital
Chapter 13: Corporate Valuation, Value-Based Management and Corporate Governance
523

A second strategic planning meeting was called to address this unexpected result.
In it, Bell Memory’s managers proposed a $20 million marketing campaign to boost
their sales growth rate from 5% to 6%. They argued that because Bell Memory is so
profitable, its value would be much higher if they could push up sales. Before accept-
ing this proposal, though, the proposed changes were run through the valuation
model. The managers changed the Bell Memory division’s growth rate from 5% to
6%; see the file Ch13 Tool Kit.xls on the textbook’s Web site for details. To their
surprise, the division’s value of operations fell to $691.5 million, and its MVA also
declined, from −$160.4 million to −$178.5 million. Although Bell Memory was prof-
itable, increasing its sales growth actually reduced its value!

Chapter 13: Corporate Valuation, Value-Based Management and Corporate Governance

To better understand these results, we can express the firm’s value in terms of four
fundamental wealth drivers:
g ¼ Growth in sales
OP ¼ Operating profitabilityðOPÞ ¼ NOPAT=Sales
CR ¼ Capital requirementsðCRÞ ¼ Operating capital=Sales
WACC ¼ Weighted average cost of capital
How do these drivers affect the value of a firm? First, the sales growth rate usually
(but not always) has a positive effect on value, provided the company is profitable
enough. However, the effect can be negative if growth requires a great deal of capital
and if the cost of capital is high. Second, operating profitability, which measures the
after-tax profit per dollar of sales, always has a positive effect—the higher the better.
Third, the capital requirements ratio, which measures how much operating capital is
needed to generate a dollar of sales, also has a consistent effect: the lower the CR the
better, since a low CR means that the company can generate new sales with smaller
amounts of new capital. Finally, the fourth factor, the WACC, also has a consistent
effect: the lower it is, the higher the firm’s value.
Another important metric in the corporate valuation model is the expected
return on invested capital (EROIC), defined as the expected NOPAT for the com-
ing year divided by the amount of operating capital at the beginning of the year
(which is the end of the preceding year). It can also be defined in terms of the funda-
mental value drivers for profitability (OP) and capital requirements (CR). Thus,
EROIC represents the expected return on the capital that has already been invested:
EROICN ¼ NOPATNþ1
CapitalN
¼ OPNþ1
CRN
(13-3)
To illustrate, the EROIC of the Bell Memory division for 2015, the last year in
the forecast period, is
EROIC2015 ¼ NOPAT2016
Capital2015
¼ NOPAT2015ð1 þ gÞ
Capital2015
¼ $100:3ð1:05Þ
$1;110:4
¼ 9:5%
To see exactly how the four value drivers and EROIC determine value for a con-
stant growth firm, we can start with Equation 13-2 (which we repeat here),
Vopðat time NÞ ¼
FCFNþ1
WACC −g

Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

Equation 13-4 shows that the value of operations can be divided into two components:
(1) the dollars of operating capital that investors have provided; and (2) the additional
value that management has added or subtracted, which is equivalent to MVA.
Note that the first [bracketed] fraction in Equation 13-4 represents the present
value of growing sales, discounted at the WACC. This would be the MVA of a firm
that has no costs and that never needs to invest additional capital. But firms do have
costs and capital requirements, and their effect is captured by the term in the second
set of brackets. Here we see that, holding g constant, MVA will improve if operating
profitability (OP) increases, if WACC decreases, and/or if capital requirements (CR)
decrease.
Observe that an increase in growth will not necessarily increase value. OP could be
positive, but if CR is quite high—meaning that a lot of new capital is needed to support
a given increase in sales—then the second bracketed term can be negative. In this situ-
ation, growth causes first bracketed term to increase; however, since it’s being multi-
plied by a negative term (the second bracket), the net result will be a decrease in MVA.
We can also rewrite Equation 13-2 in terms of EROIC (or profitability and capital
requirements) as follows:
Vopðat time NÞ ¼ CapitalN þ CapitalNðEROICN −WACCÞ
WACC −g
¼ CapitalN þ
CapitalN
OPNþ1
CRN
−WACC


WACC −g
(13-5)
Equation 13-5 also breaks value into two components, the value of capital and the
MVA, shown in the second term. This term for MVA shows that value depends on
the EROIC, the WACC, and the spread between the expected return on invested
capital. Notice that the EROIC in turn depends on profitability and required capital.
If the combination of profitability and required capital produces an EROIC greater
than WACC, then the return on capital is greater than the return investors expect
and management is adding value. In this case, an increase in the growth rate causes
value to go up. If EROIC is exactly equal to WACC then the firm is, in an economic
sense, “breaking even.” It has positive accounting profits and cash flow, but these cash
flows are just sufficient to satisfy investors, causing value to exactly equal the amount of
capital that has been provided. If EROIC is less than WACC then the term in paren-
theses is negative, management is destroying value, and growth is harmful. This is one
case where the faster the growth rate, the lower the firm’s value.
We should also note that the insights from Equations 13-4 and 13-5 apply to all
firms, but the equations themselves can be applied only to relatively stable firms
whose growth has leveled out at a constant rate. For example, in 2008 Qualcomm’s
sales grew at 25% per year, so we cannot apply Equations 13-4 and 13-5 directly (al-
though we could always apply Equation 13-1). Qualcomm’s NOPAT/Sales ratio was
an outstanding 27.6%, but even though Qualcomm was profitable, it had a negative
free cash flow of about $3.9 billion! If Qualcomm can maintain profitability as its growth
slows to sustainable levels, it will generate huge amounts of FCF. This explains why its
MVA was over $38 billion in 2008 even though its FCF was negative.
Table 13-7 shows the value drivers for Bell’s two divisions as measured at 2015,
the end of the forecast period. We report these for the end of the forecast period
Chapter 13: Corporate Valuation, Value-Based Management and Corporate Governance
527

because ratios can change during the forecast period in response to input changes. By
the end of the forecast period, however, all inputs and ratios should be stable.
Both divisions have the same growth rate and the same WACC, as shown in Table
13-7. Bell Memory is more profitable, but it also has much higher capital requirements.
The result is that Bell Memory’s EROIC is only 9.5%, well below its 10.5% WACC.
Thus, growth doesn’t help Bell Memory—indeed, it reduces the division’s value.
Based on this analysis, Bell Memory’s managers decided not to request funds for a
marketing campaign. Instead, they developed a plan to reduce capital requirements.
The new plan called for spending $50 million on an integrated supply chain informa-
tion system that would allow them to cut their inventory/sales ratio from 30% to
20% and also reduce the ratio of net plant to sales from 59% to 50%. Table 13-8
shows projected operating results based on this new plan. The value of operations would
increase from $709.6 million to $1.1574 billion, or by $447.8 million. Because this
amount is well over the $50 million required to implement the plan, top management
decided to approve it. Note also that the plan shows MVA becoming positive at $287.4
million (a substantial improvement on the preliminary plan’s negative $160.4 million)
and the divisional EROIC rising to 13.0%, well over the 10.5% WACC.
Bell Instruments’s managers also used the valuation model to assess changes in
plans for their division. Given their high EROIC, the Instruments division proposed
(1) an aggressive marketing campaign and (2) an increase in inventories that would
allow faster delivery and fewer stockouts. Together, these changes would boost the
growth rate from 5% to 6%. The direct cost to implement the plan was $20 million,
but there was also an indirect cost in that more inventories would have to be carried:
The ratio of inventories to sales was forecasted to increase from 15% to 16%.
Should Instruments’s new plan be implemented? Table 13-8 shows the forecasted
results. The capital requirements associated with the increased inventory caused the
EROIC to fall from 18.9% to 18.6%, but (1) the 18.6% return greatly exceeds the
10.5% WACC, and (2) the spread between 18.6% and 10.5% would be earned on
additional capital. This caused the forecasted value of operations to increase from
$505.5 to $570.1 million, or by $64.6 million. An 18.6% return on $274.3 million
of capital is more valuable than an 18.9% return on $255.3 million of capital.8 (To
see this, note that you, or one of Bell’s stockholders, would surely rather have an
asset that provides a 50% return on an investment of $1,000 than one that provides

8A potential fly in the ointment is that Bell’s compensation plan might be based on rates of return and
not on changes in wealth. In such a plan, which is fairly typical, the managers might reject the new pro-
posed strategic plan if it lowers ROIC and hence their bonuses, even though the plan is good for the
company’s stockholders. We discuss the effect of compensation plans in more detail later in the chapter.

Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

a 100% return on an investment of $1.) Therefore, the new plan should be accepted,
even though it lowers the Instruments division’s EROIC.
Sometimes companies focus on their profitability and growth without giving adequate
consideration to their capital requirements. This is a big mistake—all the wealth creation
drivers, not just growth, must be taken into account. Fortunately for Bell’s investors, the
revised plan was accepted. However, as this example illustrates, it is easy for a company to
mistakenly focus only on profitability and growth. They are important, but so are the
other value drivers: capital requirements and the weighted average cost of capital. Value-
based management explicitly includes the effects of all the value drivers because it uses the
corporate valuation model, and the drivers are all embodied in that model.9

What are the four drivers of value?
How is it possible for sales growth to decrease the value of a profitable firm?
You are given the following forecasted information for a constant growth company:
sales = $10 million, operating profitability (OP) = 5%, capital requirements (CR) = 40%,
growth (g) = 6%, and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) = 10%. What is the
current level of capital? ($4 million) What is the current level of NOPAT? ($0.5 million)
What is the EROIC? (13.25%) What is the value of operations? ($7.25 million)

13.4 MANAGERIAL BEHAVIOR AND
SHAREHOLDER WEALTH
Shareholders want companies to hire managers who are able and willing to take legal
and ethical actions to maximize intrinsic stock prices.10 This obviously requires man-
agers with technical competence, but it also requires managers who are willing to put
forth the extra effort necessary to identify and implement value-adding activities.
However, managers are people, and people have both personal and corporate goals.
Logically, therefore, managers can be expected to act in their own self-interests, and
if their self-interests are not aligned with those of stockholders, then corporate value
will not be maximized. There are six ways in which a manager’s behavior might harm
a firm’s intrinsic value.
1. Managers might not expend the time and effort required to maximize firm value.
Rather than focusing on corporate tasks, they might spend too much time on
external activities, such as serving on boards of other companies, or on nonpro-
ductive activities, such as golfing, lunching, and traveling.
2. Managers might use corporate resources on activities that benefit themselves
rather than shareholders. For example, they might spend company money on
such perquisites as lavish offices, memberships at country clubs, museum-quality
art for corporate apartments, large personal staffs, and corporate jets. Because
these perks are not actually cash payments to the managers, they are called
nonpecuniary benefits.
3. Managers might avoid making difficult but value-enhancing decisions that harm
friends in the company. For example, a manager might not close a plant or ter-
minate a project if the manager has personal relationships with those who are
adversely affected by such decisions, even if termination is the economically
sound action.
4. Managers might take on too much risk or they might not take on enough risk. For
example, a company might have the opportunity to undertake a risky project with a
positive NPV. If the project turns out badly, then the manager’s reputation will be
harmed and the manager might even be fired. Thus, a manager might choose to
avoid risky projects even if they are desirable from a shareholder’s point of view.
On the other hand, a manager might take on projects with too much risk. Consider
a project that is not living up to expectations. A manager might be tempted to
invest even more money in the project rather than admit that the project is a fail-
ure. Or a manager might be willing to take on a second project with a negative
NPV if it has even a slight chance of a very positive outcome, since hitting a home
run with this second project might cover up the first project’s poor performance.
In other words, the manager might throw good money after bad.
5. If a company is generating positive free cash flow, a manager might “stockpile” it
in the form of marketable securities instead of returning FCF to investors. This
10Notice that we said both legal and ethical actions. The accounting frauds perpetrated by Enron,
WorldCom, and others that were uncovered in 2002 raised stock prices in the short run, but only because
investors were misled about the companies’ financial positions. Then, when the correct financial informa-
tion was finally revealed, the stocks tanked. Investors who bought shares based on the fraudulent financial
statements lost tens of billions of dollars. Releasing false financial statements is illegal. Aggressive earnings
management and the use of misleading accounting tricks to pump up reported earnings is unethical, and
executives can go to jail as a result of their shenanigans. When we speak of taking actions to maximize
stock prices, we mean making operational or financial changes designed to maximize intrinsic stock value,
not fooling investors with false or misleading financial reports.

Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

potentially harms investors because it prevents them from allocating these funds to
other companies with good growth opportunities. Even worse, positive FCF often
tempts a manager into paying too much for the acquisition of another company. In
fact, most mergers and acquisitions end up as break-even deals, at best, for the
acquiring company because the premiums paid for the targets are often very large.
Why would a manager be reluctant to return cash to investors? First, extra cash
on hand reduces the company’s risk, which appeals to many managers. Second, a
large distribution of cash to investors is an admission that the company doesn’t have
enough good investment opportunities. Slow growth is normal for a maturing com-
pany, but it isn’t very exciting for a manager to admit this. Third, there is a lot of
glamour associated with making a large acquisition, and this can provide a large
boost to a manager’s ego. Fourth, compensation usually is higher for executives at
larger companies; cash distributions to investors make a company smaller, not larger.
6. Managers might not release all the information that is desired by investors.
Sometimes, they might withhold information to prevent competitors from gain-
ing an advantage. At other times, they might try to avoid releasing bad news. For
example, they might “massage” the data or “manage the earnings” so that the
news doesn’t look so bad. If investors are unsure about the quality of information
provided by managers, they tend to discount the company’s expected free cash
flows at a higher cost of capital, which reduces the company’s intrinsic value.
If senior managers believe there is little chance that they will be removed, we say
that they are entrenched. Such a company faces a high risk of being poorly run,
because entrenched managers are able to act in their own interests rather than in
the interests of shareholders.

Name six types of managerial behaviors that can reduce a firm’s intrinsic value.
13.5 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
A key requirement for successful implementation of value-based management is to influ-
ence executives and other managers so that they do not behave in the ways described in
the previous section but instead behave in a way that maximizes a firm’s intrinsic value.
Corporate governance can provide just such an influence. Corporate governance can be
defined as the set of laws, rules, and procedures that influence a company’s operations
and the decisions made by its managers. At the risk of oversimplification, most corporate
governance provisions come in two forms, sticks and carrots. The primary stick is the
threat of removal, either as a decision by the board of directors or as the result of a hostile
takeover. If a firm’s managers are maximizing the value of the resources entrusted to
them, they need not fear the loss of their jobs. On the other hand, if managers are not
maximizing value, they should be removed by their own boards of directors, by dissident
stockholders, or by other companies seeking to profit by installing a better management
team. The main carrot is compensation. Managers have greater incentives to maximize
intrinsic stock value if their compensation is linked to their firm’s performance rather
than being strictly in the form of salary.
Almost all corporate governance provisions affect either the threat of removal or
compensation. Some provisions are internal to a firm and are under its control.11
11We have adapted this framework from the one provided by Stuart L. Gillan, “Recent Developments in
Corporate Governance: An Overview,” Journal of Corporate Finance, June 2006, pp. 381–402. Gillan pro-
vides an excellent discussion of the issues associated with corporate governance, and we highly recom-
mend this article to the reader who is interested in an expanded discussion of the issues in this section.
Chapter 13: Corporate Valuation, Value-Based Management and Corporate Governance
531

These internal provisions and features can be divided into five areas: (1) monitoring
and discipline by the board of directors, (2) charter provisions and bylaws that affect
the likelihood of hostile takeovers, (3) compensation plans, (4) capital structure
choices, and (5) accounting control systems. In addition to the corporate governance
provisions that are under a firm’s control, there are also environmental factors out-
side of a firm’s control, such as the regulatory environment, block ownership pat-
terns, competition in the product markets, the media, and litigation. Our discussion
begins with the internal provisions.
Monitoring and Discipline by the Board of Directors
Shareholders are a corporation’s owners, and they elect the board of directors to act
as agents on their behalf. In the United States, it is the board’s duty to monitor
senior managers and discipline them if they do not act in the interests of share-
holders, either by removal or by a reduction in compensation.12 This is not necessar-
ily the case outside the United States. For example, many companies in Europe are
required to have employee representatives on the board. Also, many European and
Asian companies have bank representatives on the board. But even in the United
States, many boards fail to act in the shareholders’ best interests. How can this be?
Consider the election process. The board of directors has a nominating committee.
These directors choose the candidates for the open director positions, and the ballot
for a board position usually lists only one candidate. Although outside candidates can
run a “write-in” campaign, only those candidates named by the board’s nominating
committee are on the ballot.13 At many companies, the CEO is also the chairman of
the board and has considerable influence on this nominating committee. This means
that in practice it often is the CEO who, in effect, nominates candidates for the board.
High compensation and prestige go with a position on the board of a major company, so
board seats are prized possessions. Board members typically want to retain their posi-
tions, and they are grateful to whomever helped get them on the board. Thus, the nom-
inating process often results in a board that is favorably disposed to the CEO.
At most companies, a candidate is elected simply by having a majority of votes cast.
The proxy ballot usually lists all candidates, with a box for each candidate to check if
the shareholder votes “For” the candidate and a box to check if the shareholder “with-
holds” a vote on the candidate—you can’t actually vote “No”; you can only withhold
your vote. In theory, a candidate could be elected with a single “For” vote if all other
votes were withheld. In practice, though, most shareholders either vote “For” or assign
to management their right to vote (proxy is defined as the authority to act for another,
which is why it is called a proxy statement). In practice, then, the nominated candidates
virtually always receive a majority of votes and are thus elected.
Occasionally there is a “Just vote no” campaign in which a large investor (usually an
institution such as a pension fund) urges stockholders to withhold their votes for one or
more directors. Although such campaigns do not directly affect the director’s election,
they do provide a visible way for investors to express their dissatisfaction. Recent evi-
dence shows that “Just vote no” campaigns at poorly performing firms lead to better
subsequent firm performance and a greater probability that the CEO will be dismissed.14
12There are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, some states have laws allowing the board to take
into consideration the interests of other stakeholders, such as employees and members of the community.
13There is currently (early 2009) a movement under way to allow also shareholders to nominate candi-
dates for the board, but only time will tell whether this movement is successful.

tional Investor Activists ‘Just Vote No’?” Journal of Financial Economics, October 2008, pp. 84–103.

Voting procedures also affect the ability of outsiders to gain positions on the
board. If the charter specifies cumulative voting, then each shareholder is given a
number of votes equal to his or her shares multiplied by the number of board seats
up for election. For example, the holder of 100 shares of stock will receive 1,000
votes if 10 seats are to be filled. Then, the shareholder can distribute those votes
however he or she sees fit. One hundred votes could be cast for each of 10 candi-
dates, or all 1,000 votes could be cast for one candidate. If noncumulative voting is
used, our hypothetical stockholder cannot concentrate votes in this way—no more
than 100 votes can be cast for any one candidate.
With noncumulative voting, if management controls 51% of the shares then they
can fill every seat on the board, leaving dissident stockholders without any represen-
tation on the board. With cumulative voting, however, if 10 seats are to be filled then
dissidents could elect a representative, provided they have 10% plus 1 additional
share of the stock.
Note also that bylaws specify whether the entire board is to be elected annually or
if directors are to have staggered terms with, say, one-third of the seats to be filled
each year and directors to serve three-year terms. With staggered terms, fewer seats
come up each year, making it harder for dissidents to gain representation on the
board. Staggered boards are also called classified boards.
Many board members are “insiders”—that is, people who hold managerial posi-
tions within the company, such as the CFO. Because insiders report to the CEO, it
may be difficult for them to oppose the CEO at a board meeting. To help mitigate
this problem, several exchanges, such as the NYSE and Nasdaq, now require that
listed companies have a majority of outside directors.
Some “outside” board members often have strong connections with the CEO
through professional relationships, personal friendships, and consulting or other
Let’s Go to Miami! IBM’s 2009 Annual Meeting
IBM invited its stockholders to its annual meeting
held on April 28, 2009, in Miami. The agenda included
election of each board member for a 1-year term, ratifi-
cation of PricewaterhouseCoopers as its independent
auditing firm, approval of long-term incentive plans
for executives, and three stockholder proposals: (1)
adopt cumulative voting; (2) remove consideration of
pension income that does not reflect operating perfor-
mance from the measure of income used for bonuses;
(3) adopt an advisory shareholder vote each year ratify-
ing (or not) executive compensation. IBM’s board re-
commended that shareholders vote against all three
proposals.
About 8 pages of the proxy statement described
nominees for the board and their compensation, about
53 pages explained executive compensation, and about
4½ pages covered the stockholders’ proposals, with
much of that being management’s explanation for why
it opposed them.
Stockholders were permitted to vote over the Web,
by telephone, by mail, or in person at the meeting.
When the result were tallied, IBM revealed that all
board nominees had been elected by a majority and
that all three stockholder proposals had been defeated,
although the last two proposals garnered over 43% of
the votes in their favor.a
IBM’s annual meeting might not have been as excit-
ing as the TV show CSI: Miami, but we think the evidence
shows that there will be more stockholder proposals in
the future and that many will win approval.
aIBM had not released the actual vote count for any
directors at the time this was written, but the results will be
in IBM’s 10-Q report for the quarter ending in June 2009.

fee-generating activities. In fact, outsiders sometimes have very little expert business
knowledge but have “celebrity” status from nonbusiness activities. Some companies
also have interlocking boards of directors, where Company A’s CEO sits on Com-
pany B’s board and B’s CEO sits on A’s board. In these situations, even the outside
directors are not truly independent and impartial.
Large boards (those with more than about ten members) often are less effective
than smaller boards. As anyone who has been on a committee can attest, individual
participation tends to fall as committee size increases. Thus, there is a greater likeli-
hood that members of a large board will be less active than those on smaller boards.
The compensation of board members has an impact on the board’s effectiveness.
When board members have exceptionally high compensation, the CEO also tends to
have exceptionally high compensation. This suggests that such boards tend to be too
lenient with the CEO.15 The form of board compensation also affects board perfor-
mance. Rather than compensating board members with only salary, many companies
now include restricted stock grants or stock options in an effort to better align board
members with stockholders.
Studies show that corporate governance usually improves if (1) the CEO is not also
the chairman of the board, (2) the board has a majority of true outsiders who bring
some type of business expertise to the board and are not too busy with other activities,
(3) the board is not too large, and (4) board members are compensated appropriately
(not too high and not all cash, but including exposure to equity risk through options
or stock). The good news for the shareholder is that the boards at many companies
have made significant improvements in these directions during the past decade. Fewer
CEOs are also board chairmen and, as power has shifted from CEOs to boards as a
whole, there has been a tendency to replace insiders with strong, independent outsiders.
Today, the typical board has about one-third insiders and two-thirds outsiders, and
most outsiders are truly independent. Moreover, board members are compensated
primarily with stock or options rather than a straight salary. These changes clearly
have decreased the patience of boards with poorly performing CEOs. Within the past
several years the CEOs of Wachovia, Sprint Nextel, Gap, Hewlett-Packard, Home
Depot, Citigroup, Pfizer, Ford and Dynegy, to name just a few, have been removed by
their boards. This would have been unheard of 30 years ago.
Charter Provisions and Bylaws That Affect the Likelihood
of Hostile Takeovers
Hostile takeovers usually occur when managers have not been willing or able to max-
imize the profit potential of the resources under their control. In such a situation,
another company can acquire the poorly performing firm, replace its managers,
increase free cash flow, and improve MVA. The following paragraphs describe some
provisions that can be included in a corporate charter to make it harder for poorly
performing managers to remain in control.16
A shareholder-friendly charter should ban targeted share repurchases, also
known as greenmail. For example, suppose a company’s stock is selling for $20 per
15See I. E. Brick, O. Palmon, and J. Wald, “CEO Compensation, Director Compensation, and Firm Per-
formance: Evidence of Cronyism?” Journal of Corporate Finance, June 2006, pp. 403–423.
16Some states have laws that go further than others to protect management. This is one reason that many
companies are incorporated in manager-friendly Delaware. Some companies have even shifted their state
of incorporation to Delaware because their managers felt that a hostile takeover attempt was likely. Note
that a “shareholder-friendly charter” could and would waive the company’s right to strong anti-takeover
protection, even if the state allowed it.
534
Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

share. Now a hostile bidder, or raider, who plans to replace management if the take-
over is successful, buys 5% of the company’s stock at the $20 price.17 The raider then
makes an offer to purchase the remainder of the stock for $30 per share. The company
might offer to buy back the raider’s stock at a price of, say, $35 per share. This is called
a targeted share repurchase since the stock will be purchased only from the raider and
not from any other shareholders. A raider who paid only $20 per share for the stock
would be making a quick profit of $15 per share, which could easily total several hun-
dred million dollars. As a part of the deal, the raider would sign a document promising
not to attempt to take over the company for a specified number of years; hence the
buyback also is called greenmail. Greenmail hurts shareholders in two ways. First,
they are left with $20 stock when they could have received $30 per share. Second, the
company purchased stock from the bidder at $35 per share, which represents a direct
loss by the remaining shareholders of $15 for each repurchased share.
Managers who buy back stock in targeted repurchases typically argue that their
firms are worth more than the raiders offered and that, in time, the “true value”
will be revealed in the form of a much higher stock price. This situation might be
true if a company were in the process of restructuring itself, or if new products with
high potential were in the pipeline. But if the old management had been in power for
a long time and had a history of making empty promises, then one should question
whether the true purpose of the buyback was to protect stockholders or management.
Another characteristic of a stockholder-friendly charter is that it does not contain
a shareholder rights provision, better described as a poison pill. These provisions
give the shareholders of target firms the right to buy a specified number of shares in
the company at a very low price if an outside group or firm acquires a specified per-
centage of the firm’s stock. Therefore, if a potential acquirer tries to take over a com-
pany, its other shareholders will be entitled to purchase additional shares of stock at a
bargain price, thus seriously diluting the holdings of the raider. For this reason, these
clauses are called poison pills, because if they are in the charter, the acquirer will end
up swallowing a poison pill if the acquisition is successful. Obviously, the existence of
a poison pill makes a takeover more difficult, and this helps to entrench management.
A third management entrenchment tool is a restricted voting rights provision,
which automatically cancels the voting rights of any shareholder who owns more
than a specified amount of the company’s stock. The board can grant voting rights
to such a shareholder, but this is unlikely if that shareholder plans to take over the
company.
Using Compensation to Align Managerial
and Shareholder Interests
The typical CEO today receives a fixed salary, a cash bonus based on the firm’s per-
formance, and stock-based compensation, either in the form of stock grants or option
grants. Cash bonuses often are based upon short-run operating factors, such as this
year’s growth in earnings per share, or medium-term operating performance, such
as earnings growth over the past 3 years.
Stock-based compensation is often in the form of options. Chapter 8 explains
option valuation in detail, but here we discuss how a standard stock option
17Someone can, under the law, acquire up to 5% of a firm’s stock without announcing the acquisition.
Once the 5% limit has been hit, the acquirer has 10 days to “announce” the acquisition by filing Schedule
13D with the SEC. Schedule 13D reports not only the acquirer’s number of shares but also his or her
intentions, such as a passive investment or a takeover. These reports are monitored closely, so as soon as
one is filed, management is alerted to the possibility of an imminent takeover.
Chapter 13: Corporate Valuation, Value-Based Management and Corporate Governance

compensation plan works. Suppose IBM decides to grant an option to an employee,
allowing her to purchase a specified number of IBM shares at a fixed price, called the
strike price (or exercise price), regardless of the actual price of the stock. The strike
price is usually set equal to the current stock price at the time the option is granted.
Thus, if IBM’s current price were $100, then the option would have an exercise price
of $100. Options usually cannot be exercised until after some specified period (the
vesting period), which is usually 1 to 5 years. Some grants have cliff vesting, which
means that all the granted options vest at the same date, such as 3 years after the
grant. Other grants have annual vesting, which means that a certain percentage
vest each year. For example, one-third of the options in the grant might vest each
year. The options have an expiration date, usually 10 years after issue. For our
IBM example, assume that the options have cliff vesting in 3 years and have an expi-
ration date in 10 years. Thus, the employee can exercise the option 3 years after issue
or wait as long as 10 years. Of course, the employee would not exercise unless IBM’s
stock is above the $100 exercise price, and if the price never rose above $100, the
option would expire unexercised. However, if the stock price were above $100 on
the expiration date, the option would surely be exercised.
Suppose the stock price had grown to $134 after 5 years, at which point the
employee decided to exercise the option. She would buy stock from IBM for $100,
so IBM would get only $100 for stock worth $134. The employee would (probably)
sell the stock the same day she exercised the option and hence would receive in cash
the $34 difference between the $134 stock price and the $100 exercise price. There
are two important points to note in this example. First, most employees sell stock
soon after exercising the option. Thus, the incentive effects of an option grant typi-
cally end when the option is exercised. Second, option pricing theory shows that it is
not optimal to exercise a conventional call option on stock that does not pay
dividends before the option expires: An investor is always better off selling the option
in the marketplace rather than exercising it. But because employee stock options are
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
Would the U.S. Government Be an Effective Board Director?
In response to the global economic crisis that began with
the recession of 2007, many governments are becoming
major stakeholders in heretofore publicly traded compa-
nies. For example, the U.S. government has invested
billions in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, taking them
into conservatorship and having a direct say in the com-
panies’ leadership and operations, including the dis-
missal of former Fannie Mae CEO Daniel Mudd in 2008.
The U.S. government has made multibillon-dollar
investments in banks (about $50 billion to Citigroup,
$45 billion to Bank of America, and $25 billion each to
JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo), insurance compa-
nies (almost $70 billion to AIG), and auto companies
($16 billion to GM and $7 billion to Chrysler). Much
of this has been in the form of preferred stock, which
does not give the government any direct voting or
decision-making authority. However, the government
has certainly applied moral suasion, as evidenced by
the removal of GM’s former CEO Rick Wagoner. The
government is also imposing limits on executive com-
pensation at firms receiving additional government
funds.
For the most part, however, the government does
not have voting rights at bailout recipients, nor does it
have representation on their boards of directors. It will
be interesting to see if this changes and if the govern-
ment takes a more direct role in corporate governance.

Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

not tradable, grantees often exercise the options well before they expire. For example,
people often time the exercise of options to the purchase of a new home or some
other large expenditure. But early exercise occurs not just for liquidity reasons, such
as needing cash to purchase a house, but also because of behavioral reasons. For
example, exercises occur more frequently after stock run-ups, which suggests that
grantees view the stock as overpriced.
In theory, stock options should align a manager’s interests with those of share-
holders, influencing the manager to behave in a way that maximizes the company’s
value. But in practice there are two reasons why this does not always occur.
First, suppose a CEO is granted options on 1 million shares. If we use the same
stock prices as in our previous example then the grantee would receive $34 for each
option, or a total of $34 million. Keep in mind that this is in addition to an annual sal-
ary and cash bonuses. The logic behind employee options is that they motivate people
to work harder and smarter, thus making the company more valuable and benefiting
shareholders. But take a closer look at this example. If the risk-free rate is 5.5%, the
market risk premium is 6%, and IBM’s beta is 1.19, then the expected return, based
on the CAPM, is 5.5% + 1.19(6%) = 12.64%. IBM’s dividend yield is only 0.8%, so
the expected annual price appreciation must be about 11.84% (12.64% −0.8% =
11.84%). Now note that if IBM’s stock price grew from $100 to $134 over 5 years, that
would translate to an annual growth rate of only 6%, not the 11.84% shareholders ex-
pected. Thus, the executive would receive $34 million for helping run a company that
performed below shareholders’ expectations. As this example illustrates, standard stock
options do not necessarily link executives’ wealth with that of shareholders.
Second, and even worse, the events of the early 2000s showed that some execu-
tives were willing to illegally falsify financial statements in order to drive up stock
prices just prior to exercising their stock options.18 In some notable cases, the subse-
quent stock price drop and loss of investor confidence have forced firms into
bankruptcy. Such behavior is certainly not in shareholders’ best interests!
As a result, companies today are experimenting with different types of compensa-
tion plans that involve different vesting periods and different measures of perfor-
mance. For example, from a legal standpoint it is more difficult to manipulate EVA
(Economic Value Added) than earnings per share.19 Therefore, many companies
incorporate EVA-type measures in their compensation systems. Also, many compa-
nies have quit granting options and instead are granting restricted stock that cannot
be sold until it has vested.
Just as “all ships rise in a rising tide,” so too do most stocks rise in a bull market
such as that of 2003–2007. In a strong market, even the stocks of companies whose
performance ranks in the bottom 10% of their peer group can rise and thus trigger
handsome executive bonuses. This situation is leading to compensation plans that are
based on relative as opposed to absolute stock price performance. For example, some
18Several academic studies show that option-based compensation leads to a greater likelihood of earnings
restatements (which means having to refile financial statements with the SEC because there was a material
error) and outright fraud. See A. Agrawal and S. Chadha, “Corporate Governance and Accounting
Scandals,” Journal of Law and Economics, 2006, pp. 371–406; N. Burns and S. Kedia, “The Impact
of Performance-Based Compensation on Misreporting,” Journal of Financial Economics, January 2006,
pp. 35–67; and D. J. Denis, P. Hanouna, and A. Sarin, “Is There a Dark Side to Incentive Compensa-
tion?” Journal of Corporate Finance, June 2006, pp. 467–488.
19For a discussion of EVA, see Al Ehrbar, EVA: The Real Key to Creating Wealth (New York: John Wiley
& Sons, 1998); and Pamela P. Peterson and David R. Peterson, Company Performance and Measures of
Value Added (The Research Foundation of the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts, 1996).
Chapter 13: Corporate Valuation, Value-Based Management and Corporate Governance
537

compensation plans have indexed options whose exercise prices depend on the per-
formance of the market or a subset of competitors.
Finally, the empirical results from academic studies show that the correlation
between executive compensation and corporate performance is mixed. Some studies
suggest that the type of compensation plan used affects company performance, while
others find little effect, if any. But we can say with certainty that managerial compen-
sation plans will continue to receive lots of attention from researchers, the popular
press, and boards of directors.
Capital Structure and Internal Control Systems
Capital structure decisions can affect managerial behavior. As the debt level increases,
so does the probability of bankruptcy. This increased threat of bankruptcy brings
with it two effects on behavior. First, as discussed earlier in this chapter, managers
may waste money on unnecessary expenditures and perquisites. This behavior is
more likely when times are good and firms are flush with cash; it is less likely in the
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
Shareholder Reactions to the Crisis
It is safe to say that shareholders were dismayed by the
market’s decline in 2008, and it looks like they are seek-
ing more control. RiskMetrics Group provides data on
the shareholder proposals that are included in proxy
statements, with votes tallied at the annual meetings.
The 2009 proxy season saw an enormous number of
proposals related to corporate governance, especially
compensation, as shown below.
It will be interesting to see how companies respond
to these votes and whether more shareholder power
translates into better performance.

face of high debt levels and possible bankruptcy. Thus high levels of debt tend to
reduce managerial waste. Second, however, high levels of debt may also reduce a man-
ager’s willingness to undertake positive-NPV but risky projects. Most managers have
their personal reputation and wealth tied to a single company. If that company has a lot
of debt then a particularly risky project, even if it has a positive-NPV, may be just too
risky for the manager to tolerate because a bad outcome could lead to bankruptcy and
loss of the manager’s job. Stockholders, on the other hand, are diversified and would
want the manager to invest in positive-NPV projects even if they are risky. When man-
agers forgo risky but value-adding projects, the resulting underinvestment problem
reduces firm value. So increasing debt might increase firm value by reducing wasteful
expenditures, but it also might reduce value by inducing underinvestment by managers.
Empirical tests have not been able to establish exactly which effect dominates.
Internal control systems have become an increasingly important issue since the
passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 of the act requires companies
to establish effective internal control systems. The Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion, which is charged with the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley, defines an effec-
tive internal control system as one that provides “reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for exter-
nal purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.” In other
words, investors should be able to trust a company’s reported financial statements.
Environmental Factors Outside of a Firm’s Control
As noted earlier, corporate governance is also affected by environmental factors that
are outside of a firm’s control, including the regulatory/legal environment, block
ownership patterns, competition in the product markets, the media, and litigation.
Regulations and Laws.
The regulatory/legal environment includes the agencies
that regulate financial markets, such as the SEC. Even though the fines and penalties
levied on firms for financial misrepresentation by the SEC are relatively small, the
damage to a firm’s reputation can have significant costs, leading to extremely large
reductions in the firm’s value.20 Thus, the regulatory system has an enormous impact
on corporate governance and firm value.
The regulatory/legal environment also includes the laws and legal system under
which a company operates. These vary greatly from country to country. Studies show
that firms located in countries with strong legal protection for investors have stronger
corporate governance and that this is reflected in better access to financial markets, a
lower cost of equity, increases in market liquidity, and less noise in stock prices.21
Block Ownership Patterns.
Prior to the 1960s, most U.S. stock was owned by a
large number of individual investors, each of whom owned a diversified portfolio of
stocks. Because each individual owned a small amount of any given company’s stock,
there was little that he or she could do to influence its operations. Also, with such a
small investment, it was not cost effective for the investor to monitor companies
closely. Indeed dissatisfied stockholders would typically just “vote with their feet” by
selling the stock. This situation began to change as institutional investors such

Cooking the Books,” Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, September 2008, pp. 581–612.

nal of Corporate Finance, June 2006, pp. 560–593; and Li Jin and Stewart C. Myers, “R2 Around the

as pension funds and mutual funds gained control of larger and larger shares of invest-
ment capital—and as they then acquired larger and larger percentages of all outstand-
ing stock. Given their large block holdings, it now makes sense for institutional
investors to monitor management, and they have the clout to influence the board. In
some cases, they have actually elected their own representatives to the board. For
example, when TIAA-CREF, a huge private pension fund, became frustrated
with the performance and leadership of Furr’s/Bishop, a cafeteria chain, the fund led
a fight that ousted the entire board and then elected a new board consisting only of
outsiders.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Corporate Governance
In 2002 Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, known
in the industry as SOX, as a measure to improve transpar-
ency in financial accounting and to prevent fraud. SOX
consists of eleven chapters, or titles, which establish
wide-ranging new regulations for auditors, CEOs and
CFOs, boards of directors, investment analysts, and
investment banks. These regulations are designed to
ensure that (a) companies that perform audits are
sufficiently independent of the companies that they audit,
(b) a key executive in each company personally certifies
that the financial statements are complete and accurate,
(c) the board of directors’ audit committee is relatively in-
dependent of management, (d) financial analysts are rel-
atively independent of the companies they analyze, and
(e) companies publicly and promptly release all important
information about their financial condition. The individual
titles are briefly summarized below.
Title I establishes the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board, whose charge is to oversee auditors
and establish quality control and ethical standards for
audits.
Title II requires that auditors be independent of the
companies that they audit. Basically this means they
can’t provide consulting services to the companies
they audit. The purpose is to remove financial incen-
tives for auditors to help management cook the books.
Title III requires that the board of directors’ audit
committee must be composed of “independent” mem-
bers. Section 302 requires that the CEO and CFO must
review the annual and quarterly financial statements
and reports and personally certify that they are com-
plete and accurate. Penalties for certifying reports that
executives know are false range up to a $5 million fine,
20 years in prison, or both. Under Section 304, if the
financial statements turn out to be false and must be
restated, then certain bonuses and equity-based com-
pensation that executives earn must be reimbursed to
the company.
Title IV’s Section 401(a) requires prompt disclosure
and more extensive reporting on off–balance sheet
transactions. Section 404 requires that management
evaluate
its
internal
financial
controls
and
report
whether they are “effective.” The external auditing
firm must also indicate whether it agrees with manage-
ment’s evaluation of its internal controls. Section 409
requires that a company disclose to the public promptly
and in plain English any material changes to its finan-
cial condition. Title IV also places restrictions on the
loans that a company can make to its executives.
Title V addresses the relationship between financial
analysts, the investment banks they work for, and the
companies they cover. It requires that analysts and bro-
kers who make stock recommendations disclose any
conflicts of interest they might have concerning the
stocks they recommend.
Titles VI and VII are technical in nature, dealing with
the SEC’s budget and powers and requiring that several
studies be undertaken by the SEC.
Title VIII establishes penalties for destroying or falsi-
fying audit records. It also provides “whistle-blower
protection” for employees who report fraud.
Title IX increases the penalties for a variety of white-
collar crimes associated with securities fraud, such as
mail and wire fraud. Section 902 also makes it a crime
to alter, destroy, or hide documents that might be used
in an investigation. It also makes it a crime to conspire
to do so.
Title X requires that the CEO sign the company’s fed-
eral income tax return.
Title XI provides penalties for obstructing an investiga-
tion and grants the SEC authority to remove officers or
directors from a company if they have committed fraud.

Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

In general, activist investors with large blocks in companies have been good for all
shareholders. They have searched for firms with poor profitability and then replaced
management with new teams that are well versed in value-based management techni-
ques, thereby improving profitability. Not surprisingly, stock prices usually rise on
the news that a well-known activist investor has taken a major position in an under-
performing company.
Note that activist investors can improve performance even if they don’t go so far
as to take over a firm. More often, they either elect their own representatives to the
board or simply point out the firm’s problems to other board members. In such cases,
boards often change their attitudes and become less tolerant when they realize that
the management team is not following the dictates of value-based management.
Moreover, the firm’s top managers recognize what will happen if they don’t whip
the company into shape, and they go about doing just that.
Competition in Product Markets.
The degree of competition in a firm’s product
market has an impact on its corporate governance. For example, companies in indus-
tries with lots of competition don’t have the luxury of tolerating poorly performing
CEOs. As might be expected, CEO turnover is higher in competitive industries than
in those with less competition.22 When most firms in an industry are fairly similar,
you might expect it to be easier to find a qualified replacement from another firm
for a poorly performing CEO. This is exactly what the evidence shows: As industry
homogeneity increases, so does the incidence of CEO turnover.23
The Media and Litigation.
Corporate governance, especially compensation, is a
hot topic in the media. The media can have a positive impact by discovering or
reporting corporate problems, such as the Enron scandal. Another example is the
extensive coverage that was given to option backdating, in which the exercise prices
of executive stock options were set after the options officially were granted. Because
the exercise prices were set at the lowest stock price during the quarter in which the
options were granted, the options were in-the-money and more valuable when their
“official” lives began. Several CEOs have already lost their jobs over this practice,
and more firings are likely.
However, the media can also hurt corporate governance by focusing too much
attention on a CEO. Such “superstar” CEOs often command excessive compensation
packages and spend too much time on activities outside the company, resulting in too
much pay for too little performance.24
In addition to penalties and fines from regulatory bodies such as the SEC, civil
litigation also occurs when companies are suspected of fraud. Recent research indi-
cates that such suits lead to improvements in corporate governance.25

International Corporate Governance
Corporate governance includes the following factors: (1)
the likelihood that a poorly performing firm can be
taken over; (2) whether the board of directors is domi-
nated by insiders or outsiders; (3) the extent to which
most of the stock is held by a few large “blockholders”
versus many small shareholders; and (4) the size and
form of executive compensation. An interesting study
compared corporate governance in Germany, Japan,
and the United States.
First, note from the accompanying table that the
threat of a takeover serves as a stick in the United
States but not in Japan or Germany. This threat, which
reduces management entrenchment, should benefit
shareholders in the United States relative to the other
two countries. Second, German and Japanese boards
are larger than those in the United States. Japanese
boards consist primarily of insiders, unlike German
and American boards, which have similar inside/out-
side mixes. It should be noted, though, that the boards
of most large German corporations include represen-
tatives of labor, whereas U.S. boards represent only
shareholders. Thus, it would appear that U.S. boards,
with a higher percentage of outsiders, would have
interests
most
closely
aligned
with
those
of
shareholders.
German and Japanese firms are also more likely
to be controlled by large blocks of stock than those
in the United States. Although pension and mutual
funds, as well as other institutional investors, are in-
creasingly important in the United States, block own-
ership is still less prevalent than in Germany and
Japan. In both Germany and Japan, banks often
own large blocks of stock, something that is not per-
mitted by law in the United States, and corporations
also own large blocks of stock in other corporations.
In Japan, combinations of companies, called keiret-
sus, have cross-ownership of stock among the mem-
ber companies, and these interlocking blocks distort
the definition of an outside board member. For ex-
ample, when the performance of a company in a
keiretsu deteriorates, new directors are often ap-
pointed from the staffs of other members of the keir-
etsu. Such appointees might be classified officially as
insiders,
but
they
represent
interests
other
than
those of the troubled company’s CEO.
In general, large blockholders are better able to
monitor management than are small investors, so
one might expect the blockholder factor to favor Ger-
man and Japanese shareholders. However, these
blockholders have other relationships with the com-
pany that might be detrimental to outside share-
holders. For example, if one company buys from
another,
transfer
pricing
might
be
used
to
shift
wealth to a favored company, or a company might
be forced to buy from a sister company in spite of
the availability of lower-cost resources from outside
the group.
Executive compensation packages differ dramati-
cally across the three countries, with U.S. executives re-
ceiving by far the highest compensation. However,
compensation plans are remarkably similar in terms of
how
sensitive
total
compensation
is
to
corporate
performance.
Which country’s system of corporate governance is
best from the standpoint of a shareholder whose goal
is stock price maximization? There is no definitive an-
swer. U.S. stocks have had the best performance in re-
cent years. Moreover, German and Japanese companies
are slowly moving toward the U.S. system with respect
to size of compensation, and compensation plans in all
three countries are being linked ever more closely to per-
formance. At the same time, however, U.S. companies
are moving toward the others in the sense of having
larger ownership blocks; because those blocks are pri-
marily held by pension and mutual funds (rather than
banks and related corporations), they better represent
the interests of shareholders.

13.6 EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS (ESOPS)
Studies show that 90% of the employees who receive stock under option plans sell
the stock as soon as they exercise their options, so the plans motivate employees
only for a limited period.26 Moreover, many companies limit their stock option plans
to key managers and executives. To help provide long-term productivity gains
and improve retirement incomes for all employees, Congress authorized the use of
Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs). Today about 9,000 privately held
companies and 1,000 publicly held firms have ESOPs, and more are being created
every day. Typically, the ESOP’s major asset is shares of the common stock of the
company that created it, and of the 10,000 total ESOPs, about 2,500 of them actually
own a majority of their company’s stock.27
To illustrate how an ESOP works, consider Gallagher & Abbott Inc. (G&A), a
construction company located in Knoxville, Tennessee. G&A’s simplified balance

Now G&A creates an ESOP, which is a new legal entity. The company issues
500,000 shares of new stock at $100 per share, or $50 million in total, which it sells
to the ESOP. The company’s employees are the ESOP’s stockholders, and each em-
ployee receives an ownership interest based on the size of his or her salary and years
of service. The ESOP borrows the $50 million to buy the newly issued stock.28
Financial institutions are willing to lend the ESOP the money because G&A signs a
guarantee for the loan. Here is the company’s new balance sheet:

The company now has an additional $50 million of cash and $50 million more of
book equity, but it has a de facto liability owing to its guarantee of the ESOP’s debt.
It could use the cash to finance an expansion, but many companies use the cash to
repurchase their own common stock, so we assume that G&A will do likewise. The
company’s new balance sheets, and that of the ESOP, are shown below:

Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

Note that although the company’s balance sheet looks exactly as it did initially, there
is actually a huge difference—the company has guaranteed the ESOP’s debt and
hence it has an off–balance sheet liability of $50 million. Moreover, because the
ESOP has no equity, the guarantee is very real indeed. Finally, observe that operat-
ing assets have not been increased at all, but the total debt outstanding supported by
those assets has increased by $50 million.29
If this were the whole story, then there would be no reason to have an ESOP.
However, G&A has promised to make payments to the ESOP in sufficient amounts
to enable the ESOP to pay interest and principal charges on the debt, amortizing it
over 15 years. Thus, after 15 years, the debt will be paid off and the ESOP’s equity
holders (the employees) will have equity with a book value of $50 million and a mar-
ket value that could be much higher if G&A’s stock increases, as it should over time.
Then, as employees retire, the ESOP will distribute a pro rata amount of the G&A
stock to each employee, who can then use it as a part of his or her retirement plan.
An ESOP is clearly beneficial for employees, but why would a company want to
establish one? There are five primary reasons.
1. Congress passed the enabling legislation in hopes of enhancing employees’ pro-
ductivity and thus making the economy more efficient. In theory, employees who
have equity in the enterprise will work harder and smarter. Note too that if
employees are more productive and creative then this will benefit outside share-
holders, because productivity enhancements that benefit ESOP shareholders also
benefit outside shareholders.
2. The ESOP represents additional compensation to employees: in our example,
there is a $50 million (or more) transfer of wealth from existing shareholders to
employees over the 15-year period. Presumably, if the ESOP were not created
then some other form of compensation would have been required, and that
alternative compensation might not have the secondary benefit of enhancing
productivity. Also note that the ESOP’s payments to employees (as opposed to
the payment by the company) come primarily at retirement, and Congress
wanted to boost retirement incomes.
3. Depending on when an employee’s rights to the ESOP are vested, the ESOP
may help the firm retain employees.
4. There are strong tax incentives that encourage a company to form an ESOP.
First, Congress decreed that when the ESOP owns 50% or more of the com-
pany’s common stock, financial institutions that lend money to ESOPs can
exclude from taxable income 50% of the interest they receive on the loan. This
improves the financial institutions’ after-tax returns, which allows them to lend
to ESOPs at below-market rates. Therefore, a company that establishes an
ESOP can borrow through the ESOP at a lower rate than would otherwise be
available—in our example, the $50 million of debt would be at a reduced rate.
There is also a second tax advantage. If the company were to borrow directly,
it could deduct interest but not principal payments from its taxable income.
However, companies typically make the required payments to their ESOPs in the
form of cash dividends. Dividends are not normally deductible from taxable
income, but cash dividends paid on ESOP stock are deductible if the dividends are paid
to plan participants or are used to repay the loan. Thus, companies whose ESOPs
29We assumed that the company used the $50 million paid to it by the ESOP to repurchase common
stock and thus to increase its de facto debt. It could have used the $50 million to retire debt, in which
case its true debt ratio would remain unchanged, or it could have used the money to support an
expansion.
Chapter 13: Corporate Valuation, Value-Based Management and Corporate Governance
545

own 50% of their stock can in effect borrow on ESOP loans at subsidized rates
and then deduct both the interest and principal payments made on the loans.
American Airlines and Publix Supermarkets are two of the many firms that have
used ESOPs to obtain this benefit, along with motivating employees by giving
them an equity interest in the enterprise.
5. A less desirable use of ESOPs is to help companies avoid being acquired by
another company. The company’s CEO, or someone appointed by the CEO,
typically acts as trustee for its ESOP, and the trustee is supposed to vote the
ESOP’s shares according to the will of the plan participants. Moreover, the par-
ticipants, who are the company’s employees, usually oppose takeovers because
they frequently involve labor cutbacks. Therefore, if an ESOP owns a significant
percentage of the company’s shares, then management has a powerful tool for
warding off takeovers. This is not good for outside stockholders.
Are ESOPs good for a company’s shareholders? In theory, ESOPs motivate
employees by providing them with an ownership interest. That should increase pro-
ductivity and thereby enhance stock values. Moreover, tax incentives mitigate the
costs associated with some ESOPs. However, an ESOP can be used to help entrench
management, and that could hurt stockholders. How do the pros and cons balance
out? The empirical evidence is not entirely clear, but certain findings are worth not-
ing. First, if an ESOP is established to help defend against a takeover, then the firm’s
stock price typically falls when plans for the ESOP are announced. The market does
not like the prospect of entrenching management and having to give up the premium
normally associated with a takeover. However, if the ESOP is established for tax pur-
poses and/or to motivate employees, the stock price generally goes up at the time of
the announcement. In these cases, the company typically has a subsequent improve-
ment in sales per employee and other long-term performance measures, which stimu-
lates the stock price. Indeed, a study showed that companies with ESOPs enjoyed a
26% average annual stock return compared to a return of only 19% for peer compa-
nies without ESOPs.30 It thus appears that ESOPs, if used appropriately, can be a
powerful tool for creating shareholder value.

Summary
•
Corporate assets consist of operating assets and financial, or nonoperating,
assets.
•
Operating assets take two forms: assets-in-place and growth options.
•
Assets-in-place include the land, buildings, machines, and inventory that the
firm uses in its operations to produce products and services.
•
Growth options refer to opportunities the firm has to increase sales. They in-
clude opportunities arising from R&D expenditures, customer relationships, and
the like.
•
Financial, or nonoperating, assets are distinguished from operating assets and
include items such as investments in marketable securities and noncontrolling
interests in the stock of other companies.
•
The value of nonoperating assets is usually close to the figure reported on the
balance sheet.
30See Daniel Eisenberg, “No ESOP Fable,” Time, May 10, 1999, p. 95.

The value of operations is the present value of all the future free cash flows
expected from operations when discounted at the weighted average cost of
capital:

•
The terminal, or horizon, value is the value of operations at the end of the
explicit forecast period. It is also called the continuing value, and it is equal
to the present value of all free cash flows beyond the forecast period, dis-
counted back to the end of the forecast period at the weighted average cost
of capital:
Continuing value ¼ Vopðat time NÞ ¼

WACC −g ¼ FCFNð1 þ gÞ

•
The corporate valuation model can be used to calculate the total value of a
company by finding the value of operations plus the value of nonoperating assets.
•
The intrinsic value of equity is the total value of the company minus the value
of the debt and preferred stock. The intrinsic price per share is the total value
of the equity divided by the number of shares.
•
Value-based management involves the systematic use of the corporate valua-
tion model to evaluate a company’s potential decisions.
•
The four value drivers are (1) the growth rate (g) of sales; (2) operating profit-
ability (OP), which is measured by the ratio of NOPAT to sales; (3) capital
requirements (CR), as measured by the ratio of operating capital to sales; and
(4) the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
•
Expected return on invested capital (EROIC) is equal to expected NOPAT
divided by the amount of capital that is available at the beginning of the year.
•
A company creates value when the spread between EROIC and WACC is
positive—that is, when EROIC −WACC > 0.
•
Corporate governance involves the manner in which shareholders’ objectives
are implemented, and it is reflected in a company’s policies and actions.
•
The two primary mechanisms used in corporate governance are (1) the threat of
removal of a poorly performing CEO and (2) the type of plan used to compen-
sate executives and managers.
•
Poorly performing managers can be removed either by a takeover or by the
company’s own board of directors. Provisions in the corporate charter affect the
difficulty of a successful takeover, and the composition of the board of directors
affects the likelihood of a manager being removed by the board.
•
Managerial entrenchment is most likely when a company has a weak board of
directors coupled with strong anti-takeover provisions in its corporate charter. In
this situation, the likelihood that badly performing senior managers will be fired
is low.
•
Nonpecuniary benefits are noncash perks such as lavish offices, memberships at
country clubs, corporate jets, foreign junkets, and the like. Some of these expen-
ditures may be cost effective, but others are wasteful and simply reduce profits.
Such fat is almost always cut after a hostile takeover.
•
Targeted share repurchases, also known as greenmail, occur when a com-
pany buys back stock from a potential acquirer at a price higher than the
market price. In return, the potential acquirer agrees not to attempt to take
over the company.
Chapter 13: Corporate Valuation, Value-Based Management and Corporate Governance
547

•
Shareholder rights provisions, also known as poison pills, allow existing
shareholders to purchase additional shares of stock at a price lower than the
market value if a potential acquirer purchases a controlling stake in the company.
•
A restricted voting rights provision automatically deprives a shareholder of
voting rights if he or she owns more than a specified amount of stock.
•
Interlocking boards of directors occur when the CEO of Company A sits on
the board of Company B and also B’s CEO sits on A’s board.
•
A stock option provides for the purchase of a share of stock at a fixed price,
called the exercise price, no matter what the actual price of the stock is. Stock
options have an expiration date, after which they cannot be exercised.
•
An Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or ESOP, is a plan that facilitates
employees’ ownership of stock in the company for which they work.

a. Forecast the parts of the income statement and balance sheet that are necessary for
calculating free cash flow.
b. Calculate free cash flow for each projected year. Also calculate the growth rates of free
cash flow each year to ensure that there is constant growth (that is, the same as the
constant growth rate in sales) by the end of the forecast period.
c. Calculate operating profitability (OP = NOPAT/Sales), capital requirements (CR =
Operating capital/Sales), and expected return on invested capital (EROIC = Expected
NOPAT/Operating capital at beginning of year). Based on the spread between EROIC
and WACC, do you think that the company will have a positive Market Value Added
(MVA = Market value of company −Book value of company = Value of operations −
Operating capital)?
d. Calculate the value of operations and MVA. (Hint: First calculate the horizon value at
the end of the forecast period, which is equal to the value of operations at the end of
the forecast period.) Assume that the annual growth rate beyond the horizon is 6%.
e. Calculate the price per share of common equity as of 12/31/2010.
Mini Case
You have been hired as a consultant to Kulpa Fishing Supplies (KFS), a company that is seek-
ing to increase its value. The company’s CEO and founder, Mia Kulpa, has asked you to esti-
mate the value of two privately held companies that KFS is considering acquiring. But first,
the senior management of KFS would like for you to explain how to value companies that
don’t pay any dividends. You have structured your presentation around the following items.
a. List the two types of assets that companies own.
b. What are assets-in-place? How can their value be estimated?
c. What are nonoperating assets? How can their value be estimated?
d. What is the total value of a corporation? Who has claims on this value?
e. The first acquisition target is a privately held company in a mature industry owned by
two brothers, each with 5 million shares of stock. The company currently has free cash
flow of $20 million. Its WACC is 11%, and the FCF is expected to grow at a constant
rate of 5%. The company owns marketable securities of $100 million. It is financed
with $200 million of debt, $50 million of preferred stock, and $210 million of book
equity.
(1) What is its value of operations?
(2) What is its total corporate value?
(3) What is its intrinsic value of equity?
(4) What is its intrinsic stock price per share?
(5) What is its intrinsic MVA (MVA = Total corporate value −Total book value of
capital supplied by investors)?
554
Part 5: Corporate Valuation and Governance

f. The second acquisition target is a privately held company in a growing industry. The
target has recently borrowed $40 million to finance its expansion; it has no other debt
or preferred stock. It pays no dividends and currently has no marketable securities.
KFS expects the company to produce free cash flows of −$5 million in 1 year, $10 mil-
lion in 2 years, and $20 million in 3 years. After 3 years, free cash flow will grow at a
rate of 6%. The target’s WACC is 10% and it currently has 10 million shares of stock
outstanding.
(1)
What is the company’s horizon value (i.e., its value of operations at Year 3)? What
is its current value of operations (i.e., at Time 0)?
(2)
What is its intrinsic value of equity on a price-per-share basis?
g. KFS is also interested in applying value-based management to its own divisions. Explain
what value-based management is.
h. What are the four value drivers? How does each of them affect value?
i. What is expected return on invested capital (EROIC)? Why is the spread between
EROIC and WACC so important?
j. KFS has two divisions. Both have current sales of $1,000, current expected growth of
5%, and a WACC of 10%. Division A has high profitability (OP = 6%) but high capital
requirements (CR = 78%). Division B has low profitability (OP = 4%) but low capital
requirements (CR = 27%). Given the current growth rate of 5%, determine the intrin-
sic MVA of each division. What is the intrinsic MVA of each division if growth is in-
stead 6%?
k. What is the EROIC of each division for 5% growth and for 6% growth? How is this
related to intrinsic MVA?
l. List six potential managerial behaviors that can harm a firm’s value.
m. The managers at KFS have heard that corporate governance can affect shareholder
value. What is corporate governance? List five corporate governance provisions that are
internal to a firm and are under its control.
n. What characteristics of the board of directors usually lead to effective corporate
governance?
o. List three provisions in the corporate charter that affect takeovers.
p. Briefly describe the use of stock options in a compensation plan. What are some po-
tential problems with stock options as a form of compensation?
q. What is block ownership? How does it affect corporate governance?
r. Briefly explain how regulatory agencies and legal systems affect corporate governance.

opportunities tend to return large amounts of their cash flows to
shareholders, either by paying dividends or by using the cash to
repurchase common stock. In contrast, rapidly growing companies with
good investment opportunities are prone to invest most of their available
cash flows in new projects and thus are less likely to pay dividends or
repurchase stock. Microsoft, which was long regarded as the epitome of a
growth company, illustrates this pattern. Its sales grew from $786 million in
1989 to $28.365 billion as of June 30, 2002, which translates to an annual
growth rate of nearly 32%. Much of this growth came from investments in
new products and technology, and given its emphasis on growth, Microsoft
paid no dividends.
Market saturation and competition (including piracy) have caused its
sales growth to slow. In May, 2009, Microsoft reported annual sales
growth during the previous 12 months of about 5.6%, far short of its
spectacular earlier growth rates. As growth slowed, Microsoft’s cash
flows increased, and its cash flow from operating activities was on pace
to reach about $18 billion for 2009.
As companies tend to do when growth slows and cash flows increase,
Microsoft first began paying a regular dividend in 2003. It stunned the world
with a huge special dividend in 2005, which—when combined with its regular
dividend—totaled more than $36 billion. Perhaps not coincidentally, Microsoft’s
decision to pay dividends coincided with a change in the Tax Code that
lowered the tax rate on dividends from 35% to 15% for most investors.
In the first three quarters of its 2009 fiscal year, Microsoft paid regular
dividends of $3.3 billion and also repurchased $8.9 billion in stock, for a
total cash flow to shareholders of $12.2 billion. Microsoft still had over
$25 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheets, so
investors might expect more large cash distributions in the future.
As you read this chapter, think about Microsoft’s decisions to initiate
regular dividend payments, occasionally use special dividends, and frequently
repurchase stocks.

Because a company’s value depends on its ability to generate free cash flow (FCF),
most of this book has focused on aspects of FCF generation, including measurement,
forecasts, and risk analysis. In contrast, this chapter focuses on the use of FCF for cash
distributions to shareholders. Here are the central issues addressed in this chapter: Can
a company increase its value through its choice of distribution policy, defined as (1)
the level of distributions, (2) the form of distributions (cash dividends versus stock
repurchases), and (3) the stability of distributions? Do different groups of shareholders
prefer one form of distribution over the other? Do shareholders perceive distributions
as signals regarding a firm’s risk and expected future free cash flows?
Before addressing these questions, let’s take a look at the big picture regarding cash
distributions.
14.1 AN OVERVIEW OF CASH DISTRIBUTIONS
At the risk of stating the obvious, a company must have cash before it can make a
cash distribution to shareholders. Occasionally the cash comes from a recapitalization
or the sale of an asset, but in most cases it comes from the company’s internally gen-
erated free cash flow. Recall that FCF is defined as the amount of cash flow available
for distribution to investors after expenses, taxes, and the necessary investments in
operating capital. Thus, the source of FCF depends on a company’s investment
opportunities and its effectiveness in turning those opportunities into realities. Notice
that a company with many opportunities will have large investments in operating
capital and might have negative FCF even if the company is profitable. But when
growth begins to slow, a profitable company’s FCF will be positive and very large.
Uses of Free Cash Flow: Distributions to Shareholders
Free cash flow is generated from operations and is
available for distribution to all investors. This chapter
focuses on the distributions of FCF to shareholders in
the form of dividends and stock repurchases.

Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

Home Depot and Microsoft are good examples of once-fast-growing companies that
are now generating large amounts of free cash flows.
After FCF becomes positive, how should a company use it? There are only five
potentially “good” ways to use free cash flow: (1) pay interest expenses, (2) pay
down the principal on debt, (3) pay dividends, (4) repurchase stock, or (5) buy non-
operating assets such as Treasury bills or other marketable securities.1 Let’s examine
each of these uses.
A company’s capital structure choice determines its payments for interest expenses
and debt principal. A company’s value typically increases over time, even if the com-
pany is mature, which implies its debt will also increase over time if the company
maintains a target capital structure. If a company instead were to pay off its debt,
then it would lose valuable tax shields associated with the deductibility of interest ex-
penses. Therefore, most companies make net additions to debt over time rather than
net repayments, even if FCF is positive. This “negative use” of FCF provides even
more FCF for the other uses. We discuss capital structure choices in more detail in
Chapter 15.
A company’s working capital policies determine its level of marketable securities.
Chapter 16 discusses marketable securities in more detail, but for now you should
recognize that the decision involves a trade-off between the benefits and costs of hav-
ing a large investment in marketable securities. In terms of benefits, a large invest-
ment in marketable securities reduces the risk of financial distress should there be
an economic downturn. Also, if investment opportunities turn out to be better than
expected, marketable securities provide a ready source of funding that will not incur
the flotation or signaling costs due to raising external funds. However, there is a po-
tential agency cost: If a company has a large investment in marketable securities, then
managers might be tempted to squander the money on perks (such as corporate jets)
or high-priced acquisitions.
In summary, a company’s investment opportunities and operating plans determine
its level of FCF. The company’s capital structure policy determines the amount of
debt and interest payments. Working capital policy determines the investment in
marketable securities. The remaining FCF should be distributed to shareholders,
with the only question being how much to distribute in the form of dividends versus
stock repurchases.
Obviously this is a simplification, since companies (1) sometimes scale back their
operating plans for sales and asset growth if such reductions are needed to maintain
an existing dividend, (2) temporarily adjust their current financing mix in response to
market conditions, and (3) often use marketable securities as shock absorbers for fluc-
tuations in short-term cash flows. Still, there is an interdependence among operating
plans (which have the biggest impact on free cash flow), financing plans (which have
the biggest impact on the cost of capital), working capital policies (which determine
the target level of marketable securities), and shareholder distributions.
Self-Test
What are the five uses of free cash flows?
How do a company’s investment opportunities, capital structure, and working
capital policies affect its distributions to shareholders?
1Recall from Chapter 2 that the company’s cost of paying interest is on an after-tax basis. Recall also that
a company doesn’t spend FCF on operating assets (such as the acquisition of another company), because
those expenditures were already deducted when calculating FCF. In other words, the purchase of an oper-
ating asset (even if it is another company) is not a use of FCF; instead, it is a source of FCF (albeit a “neg-
ative source”).

14.2 PROCEDURES FOR CASH DISTRIBUTIONS
Companies can distribute cash to shareholders via cash dividends or stock repurchases.
In this section we describe the actual procedures used to make cash distributions.
Dividend Payment Procedures
Dividends are normally paid quarterly, and, if conditions permit, the dividend is in-
creased once each year. For example, Katz Corporation paid a $0.50 dividend per
share in each quarter of 2010, for an annual dividend per share of $2.00. In common
financial parlance, we say that in 2010 Katz’s regular quarterly dividend was $0.50, and
its annual dividend was $2.00. In late 2010, Katz’s board of directors met, reviewed
projections for 2011, and decided to keep the 2011 dividend at $2.00. The directors
announced the $2 rate, so stockholders could count on receiving it unless the com-
pany experienced unanticipated operating problems.
The actual payment procedure is as follows.
1. Declaration date. On the declaration date—say, on Thursday, November 11—the
directors meet and declare the regular dividend, issuing a statement similar to the
following: “On November 11, 2010, the directors of Katz Corporation met and
declared the regular quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share, payable to holders of
record as of Friday, December 10, payment to be made on Friday, January 7, 2011.”
For accounting purposes, the declared dividend becomes an actual liability on the
declaration date. If a balance sheet were constructed, an amount equal to $0.50 × n0,
where n0 is the number of shares outstanding, would appear as a current liability, and
retained earnings would be reduced by a like amount.
2. Holder-of-record date. At the close of business on the holder-of-record date,
December 10, the company closes its stock transfer books and makes up a list of
shareholders as of that date. If Katz Corporation is notified of the sale before
5 p.m. on December 10, then the new owner receives the dividend. However, if
notification is received after 5 p.m. on December 10, the previous owner gets the
dividend check.
3. Ex-dividend date. Suppose Jean Buyer buys 100 shares of stock from John Seller on
December 7. Will the company be notified of the transfer in time to list Buyer as the
new owner and thus pay the dividend to her? To avoid conflict, the securities indus-
try has set up a convention under which the right to the dividend remains with the
stock until two business days prior to the holder-of-record date; on the second day
before that date, the right to the dividend no longer goes with the shares. The date
when the right to the dividend leaves the stock is called the ex-dividend date. In this
case, the ex-dividend date is two days prior to December 10, which is December 8:
Dividend goes with stock:
Tuesday, December 7
Ex-dividend date:
Wednesday, December 8
Thursday, December 9
Holder-of-record date:
Friday, December 10
Therefore, if Buyer is to receive the dividend, she must buy the stock on or
before December 7. If she buys it on December 8 or later, Seller will receive the
dividend because he will be the official holder of record.
Katz’s dividend amounts to $0.50, so the ex-dividend date is important.
Barring fluctuations in the stock market, we would normally expect the price of

a stock to drop by approximately the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend
date. Thus, if Katz closed at $30.50 on December 7, it would probably open at
about $30 on December 8.
4. Payment date. The company actually pays the dividend on January 7, the payment
date, to the holders of record.
Stock Repurchase Procedures
Stock repurchases occur when a company buys back some of its own outstanding
stock.2 Three situations can lead to stock repurchases. First, a company may decide
to increase its leverage by issuing debt and using the proceeds to repurchase stock;
we discuss recapitalizations in more detail in Chapter 15. Second, many firms have
given their employees stock options, and companies often repurchase their own stock
to sell to employees when employees exercise the options. In this case, the number of
outstanding shares reverts to its pre-repurchase level after the options are exercised.
Third, a company may have excess cash. This may be due to a one-time cash inflow,
such as the sale of a division, or the company may simply be generating more
free cash flow than it needs to service its debt.3
Stock repurchases are usually made in one of three ways. (1) A publicly owned firm can
buy back its own stock through a broker on the open market.4 (2) The firm can make a
tender offer, under which it permits stockholders to send in (that is, “tender”) shares in
exchange for a specified price per share. In this case, the firm generally indicates it will
buy up to a specified number of shares within a stated time period (usually about two
weeks). If more shares are tendered than the company wants to buy, purchases are made
on a pro rata basis. (3) The firm can purchase a block of shares from one large holder on a
negotiated basis. This is a targeted stock repurchase, as discussed in Chapter 13.
Patterns of Cash Distributions
The occurrence of dividends versus stock repurchases has changed dramatically during
the past 30 years. First, total cash distributions as a percentage of net income have re-
mained fairly stable at around 26% to 28%, but the mix of dividends and repurchases
has changed.5 The average dividend payout ratio fell from 22.3% in 1974 to 13.8% in
1998, while the average repurchase payout as a percentage of net income rose from 3.7%
to 13.6%. Since 1985, large companies have repurchased more shares than they have
2The repurchased stock is called “treasury stock” and is shown as a negative value on the company’s de-
tailed balance sheet. On the consolidated balance sheet, treasury shares are deducted to find shares out-
standing, and the price paid for the repurchased shares is deducted when determining common equity.
3See Benton Gup and Doowoo Nam, “Stock Buybacks, Corporate Performance, and EVA,” Journal of
Applied Corporate Finance, Spring 2001, pp. 99–110. The authors show that the firms that repurchase stock
have superior operating performance to those that do not buy back stock, which is consistent with the
notion that firms buy back stock when they generate additional free cash flow. They also show that
operating performance improves in the year after the buyback, indicating that the superior performance is
sustainable.
4Many firms announce their plans to repurchase stock on the open market. For example, a company
might announce it plans to repurchase 4 million shares of stock. However, companies usually don’t buy
back all the shares they announce but instead repurchase only about 80% of the announced number. See

issued. Since 1998, more cash has been returned to shareholders in repurchases than as
dividend payments.
Second, companies today are less likely to pay a dividend. In 1978, about 66.5% of
NYSE, AMEX, and Nasdaq firms paid a dividend. In 1999, only 20.8% paid a dividend.
Part of this reduction can be explained by the large number of IPOs in the 1990s, since
young firms rarely pay a dividend. However, that doesn’t explain the entire story, as many
mature firms now do not pay dividends. For example, consider the way in which a maturing
firm will make its first cash distribution. In 1973, 73% of firms making an initial distribu-
tion did so with a dividend. By 1998, only 19% initiated distributions with dividends.6
Third, the aggregate dividend payouts have become more concentrated in the
sense that a relatively small number of older, more established, and more profitable
firms accounts for most of the cash distributed as dividends.7
Fourth, Table 14-1 shows there is considerable variation in distribution policies, with
some companies paying a high percentage of their income as dividends and others pay-
ing none. The next section discusses some theories about distribution policies.

Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

decisions, including the distribution policy. Is there an optimal distribution policy
that maximizes a company’s intrinsic value?
The answer depends in part on investors’ preferences for returns in the form of
dividend yields versus capital gains. The relative mix of dividend yields and capital
gains is determined by the target distribution ratio, which is the percentage of net
income distributed to shareholders through cash dividends or stock repurchases, and
the target payout ratio, which is the percentage of net income paid as a cash divi-
dend. Notice that the payout ratio must be less than the distribution ratio because the
distribution ratio includes stock repurchases as well as cash dividends.
A high distribution ratio and a high payout ratio mean that a company pays large di-
vidends and has small (or zero) stock repurchases. In this situation, the dividend yield is
relatively high and the expected capital gain is low. If a company has a large distribution
ratio but a small payout ratio, then it pays low dividends but regularly repurchases stock,
resulting in a low dividend yield but a relatively high expected capital gain yield. If a
company has a low distribution ratio, then it must also have a relatively low payout ratio,
again resulting in a low dividend yield and, it is hoped, a relatively high capital gain.
In this section, we examine three theories of investor preferences for dividend
yield versus capital gains: (1) the dividend irrelevance theory, (2) the dividend prefer-
ence theory (also called the “bird in the hand” theory), and (3) the tax effect theory.
Dividend Irrelevance Theory
The original proponents of the dividend irrelevance theory were Merton Miller
and Franco Modigliani (MM).8 They argued that the firm’s value is determined
only by its basic earning power and its business risk. In other words, MM argued
that the value of the firm depends only on the income produced by its assets, not
on how this income is split between dividends and retained earnings.
To understand MM’s argument, recognize that any shareholder can in theory
construct his own dividend policy. For example, if a firm does not pay dividends, a
shareholder who wants a 5% dividend can “create” it by selling 5% of his stock.
Conversely, if a company pays a higher dividend than an investor desires, the investor
can use the unwanted dividends to buy additional shares of the company’s stock. If
investors could buy and sell shares and thus create their own dividend policy without
incurring costs, then the firm’s dividend policy would truly be irrelevant.
In developing their dividend theory, MM made a number of important assump-
tions, especially the absence of taxes and brokerage costs. If these assumptions are
not true, then investors who want additional dividends must incur brokerage costs
to sell shares and must pay taxes on any capital gains. Investors who do not want di-
vidends must incur brokerage costs to purchase shares with their dividends. Because
taxes and brokerage costs certainly exist, dividend policy may well be relevant. We
will discuss empirical tests of MM’s dividend irrelevance theory shortly.
Dividend Preference (Bird-in-the-Hand) Theory
The principal conclusion of MM’s dividend irrelevance theory is that dividend policy
does not affect a stock’s value or risk. Therefore, it does not affect the required rate
of return on equity, rs. In contrast, Myron Gordon and John Lintner both argued
8See Merton H. Miller and Franco Modigliani, “Dividend Policy, Growth, and the Valuation of Shares,”
Journal of Business, October 1961, pp. 411–433. However, their conclusion is valid only if investors expect
managers eventually to pay out the equivalent of the present value of all future free cash flows; see Harry
DeAngelo and Linda DeAngelo, “The Irrelevance of the MM Dividend Irrelevance Theorem,” Journal of
Financial Economics, Vol. 79, 2006, pp. 293–315.
Chapter 14: Distributions to Shareholders: Dividends and Repurchases

that a stock’s risk declines as dividends increase: A return in the form of dividends is
a sure thing, but a return in the form of capital gains is risky. In other words, a bird
in the hand is worth more than two in the bush. Therefore, shareholders prefer di-
vidends and are willing to accept a lower required return on equity.9
The possibility of agency costs leads to a similar conclusion. First, high payouts
reduce the risk that managers will squander cash because there is less cash on hand.
Second, a high-payout company must raise external funds more often than a low-
payout company, all else held equal. If a manager knows that the company will receive
frequent scrutiny from external markets, then the manager will be less likely to engage in
wasteful practices. Therefore, high payouts reduce the risk of agency costs. With less
risk, shareholders are willing to accept a lower required return on equity.
Tax Effect Theory: Capital Gains Are Preferred
Before 2003, individual investors paid ordinary income taxes on dividends but lower
rates on long-term capital gains. The Jobs and Growth Act of 2003 changed this,
reducing the tax rate on dividend income to the same as on long-term capital
gains.10 However, there are two reasons why stock price appreciation still is taxed
more favorably than dividend income. First, the time value of money means that a dollar
of taxes paid in the future has a lower effective cost than a dollar paid today. So even
when dividends and gains are taxed equally, capital gains are never taxed sooner than
dividends. Second, if a stock is held until the shareholder dies, then no capital gains tax
is due at all: the beneficiaries who receive the stock can use its value on the date of death
as their cost basis and thus completely escape the capital gains tax.
Because dividends are in some cases taxed more highly than capital gains, investors
might require a higher pre-tax rate of return to induce them to buy dividend-paying
stocks. Therefore, investors may prefer that companies minimize dividends. If so,
then investors should be willing to pay more for low-payout companies than for
otherwise similar high-payout companies.11
Empirical Evidence on Distribution Policies
It is very difficult to construct a perfect empirical test of the relationship between pay-
out policy and the required rate of return on stock. First, all factors other than distri-
bution level should be held constant; that is, the sample companies should differ only
in their distribution levels. Second, each firm’s cost of equity should be measured with
9Myron J. Gordon, “Optimal Investment and Financing Policy,” Journal of Finance, May 1963,
pp. 264–272; and John Lintner, “Dividends, Earnings, Leverage, Stock Prices, and the Supply of Capital
to Corporations,” Review of Economics and Statistics, August 1962, pp. 243–269.
10Of course, nothing involving taxes is quite this simple. The dividend must be from a domestic com-
pany, and the investor must own the stock for more than 60 days during the 120-day period beginning
60 days before the ex-dividend date. There are other restrictions for dividends other than regular cash di-
vidends. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 cut the long-term capital gains tax
rate to zero for low-income investors (that is, those whose marginal tax rate is 15% or less) and kept it at
15% for those with more income. After 2010, unless Congress again extends the provisions, the capital
gains rates will revert to 10% and 20%, which were the capital gains rates in effect prior to the 2003
Act. Also, the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) increases the effective tax rate on dividends and capital
gains by 7% for some moderately high-income earners. See Leonard Burman, William Gale, Greg
Leiserson, and Jeffrey Rohaly, “The AMT: What’s Wrong and How to Fix It,” National Tax Journal,
September 2007, pp. 385–405.

a high degree of accuracy. Unfortunately, we cannot find a set of publicly owned firms
that differ only in their distribution levels, nor can we obtain precise estimates of the
cost of equity. Therefore, no one has yet identified a completely unambiguous rela-
tionship between the distribution level and the cost of equity or firm value.
Although none of the empirical tests is perfect, recent evidence does suggest that
firms with higher dividend payouts also have higher required returns.12 This tends to
support the tax effect hypothesis, although the size of the required return is too high
to be fully explained by taxes.
Agency costs should be most severe in countries with poor investor protection. In
such countries, companies with high dividend payouts should be more highly valued
than those with low payouts because high payouts limit the extent to which managers
can expropriate shareholder wealth. Recent research shows that this is the case, which
supports the dividend preference hypothesis in the case of companies with severe
agency problems.13
Although the evidence from these studies is mixed as to whether the average inves-
tor uniformly prefers either higher or lower distribution levels, other research does
show that individual investors have strong preferences. Also, other research shows
that investors prefer stable, predictable dividend payouts (regardless of the payout
level) and that they interpret dividend changes as signals about firms’ future pro-
spects. We discuss these issues in the next several sections.

14.4 CLIENTELE EFFECT
As we indicated earlier, different groups, or clienteles, of stockholders prefer different
dividend payout policies. For example, retired individuals, pension funds, and univer-
sity endowment funds generally prefer cash income, so they may want the firm to pay
out a high percentage of its earnings. Such investors are often in low or even zero tax
brackets, so taxes are of no concern. On the other hand, stockholders in their peak
earning years might prefer reinvestment, because they have less need for current
investment income and would simply reinvest dividends received—after first paying
income taxes on those dividends.
If a firm retains and reinvests income rather than paying dividends, those stock-
holders who need current income would be disadvantaged. The value of their stock
might increase, but they would be forced to go to the trouble and expense of selling
some of their shares to obtain cash. Also, some institutional investors (or trustees for
individuals) would be legally precluded from selling stock and then “spending
capital.” On the other hand, stockholders who are saving rather than spending divi-
dends might favor the low-dividend policy: the less the firm pays out in dividends,
the less these stockholders will have to pay in current taxes, and the less trouble and
expense they will have to go through to reinvest their after-tax dividends. Therefore,
investors who want current investment income should own shares in high–dividend

payout firms, while investors with no need for current investment income should
own shares in low–dividend payout firms. For example, investors seeking high cash
income might invest in electric utilities, which averaged a 32% payout in March
2009, while those favoring growth could invest in the software industry, which paid
out only 2.5% during the same time period.
To the extent that stockholders can switch firms, a firm can change from one div-
idend payout policy to another and then let stockholders who do not like the new
policy sell to other investors who do. However, frequent switching would be ineffi-
cient because of (1) brokerage costs, (2) the likelihood that stockholders who are sell-
ing will have to pay capital gains taxes, and (3) a possible shortage of investors who
like the firm’s newly adopted dividend policy. Thus, management should be hesitant
to change its dividend policy, because a change might cause current shareholders to
sell their stock, forcing the stock price down. Such a price decline might be tempo-
rary but might also be permanent—if few new investors are attracted by the new div-
idend policy, then the stock price would remain depressed. Of course, the new policy
might attract an even larger clientele than the firm had before, in which case the
stock price would rise.
Evidence from several studies suggests that there is, in fact, a clientele effect.14 It’s
been argued by MM and others that one clientele is as good as another, so
the existence of a clientele effect does not necessarily imply that one dividend policy
is better than any other. However, MM may be wrong, and neither they nor anyone
else can prove that the aggregate makeup of investors permits firms to disregard clien-
tele effects. This issue, like most others in the dividend arena, is still up in the air.
Self-Test
Define the clientele effect and explain how it affects dividend policy.
14.5 INFORMATION CONTENT, OR SIGNALING,
HYPOTHESIS
When MM set forth their dividend irrelevance theory, they assumed that everyone—in-
vestors and managers alike—has identical information regarding a firm’s future earnings
and dividends. In reality, however, different investors have different views on both the
level of future dividend payments and the uncertainty inherent in those payments, and
managers have better information about future prospects than public stockholders.
It has been observed that an increase in the dividend is often accompanied by an
increase in the price of a stock and that a dividend cut generally leads to a stock
price decline. Some have argued this indicates that investors prefer dividends to
capital gains. However, MM saw this differently. They noted the well-established
fact that corporations are reluctant to cut dividends, which implies that corpora-
tions do not raise dividends unless they anticipate higher earnings in the future.
Thus, MM argued that a higher than expected dividend increase is a signal to
investors that the firm’s management forecasts good future earnings. Conversely, a
dividend reduction, or a smaller than expected increase, is a signal that manage-
ment is forecasting poor earnings in the future. Thus, MM argued that investors’
reactions to changes in dividend policy do not necessarily show that investors pre-
fer dividends to retained earnings. Rather, they argue that price changes following
dividend actions simply indicate that there is important information, or signaling,
content in dividend announcements.

dends,” Journal of Financial Economics, December 1977, pp. 419–436.

Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

The initiation of a dividend by a firm that formerly paid no dividend is certainly
a significant change in distribution policy. It appears that initiating firms’ future earn-
ings and cash flows are less risky than before the initiation. However, the evidence is
mixed regarding the future profitability of initiating firms: Some studies find slightly
higher earnings after the initiation but others find no significant change in earn-
ings.15 What happens when firms with existing dividends unexpectedly increase or
decrease the dividend? Early studies, using small data samples, concluded that unex-
pected dividend changes did not provide a signal about future earnings.16 However,
more recent data with larger samples provide mixed evidence.17 On average, firms
that cut dividends had poor earnings in the years directly preceding the cut but actu-
ally improved earnings in subsequent years. Firms that increased dividends had earn-
ings increases in the years preceding the increase but did not appear to have
subsequent earnings increases. However, neither did they have subsequent declines
in earnings, so it appears that the increase in dividends is a signal that past earnings
increases were not temporary. Also, a relatively large number of firms that expect a
large permanent increase in cash flow (as opposed to earnings) do in fact increase
their dividend payouts in the year prior to the cash flow increase.
All in all, there is clearly some information content in dividend announcements:
Stock prices tend to fall when dividends are cut, even if they don’t always rise when
dividends are increased. However, this doesn’t necessarily validate the signaling
hypothesis, because it is difficult to tell whether any stock price change following a
change in dividend policy reflects only signaling effects or reflects both signaling
and dividend preferences.
Self-Test
Define signaling content, and explain how it affects dividend policy.
14.6 IMPLICATIONS FOR DIVIDEND STABILITY
The clientele effect and the information content in dividend announcements defi-
nitely have implications regarding the desirability of stable versus volatile dividends.
For example, many stockholders rely on dividends to meet expenses, and they would
be seriously inconvenienced if the dividend stream were unstable. Further, reducing
dividends to make funds available for capital investment could send incorrect signals
to investors, who might push down the stock price because they interpret the divi-
dend cut to mean that the company’s future earnings prospects have been dimin-
ished. Thus, maximizing its stock price probably requires a firm to maintain a
steady dividend policy. Because sales and earnings are expected to grow for most
firms, a stable dividend policy means a company’s regular cash dividends should also

grow at a steady, predictable rate.18 But as we explain in the next section, most com-
panies will probably move toward small, sustainable, regular cash dividends that are
supplemented by stock repurchases.

Why do the clientele effect and the information content hypotheses imply that investors

14.7 SETTING THE TARGET DISTRIBUTION LEVEL:
THE RESIDUAL DISTRIBUTION MODEL
When deciding how much cash to distribute to stockholders, two points should be
kept in mind: (1) The overriding objective is to maximize shareholder value, and (2)
the firm’s cash flows really belong to its shareholders, so a company should refrain
from retaining income unless its managers can reinvest that income to produce
returns higher than shareholders could themselves earn by investing the cash in invest-
ments of equal risk. On the other hand, recall from Chapter 9 that internal equity
(reinvested earnings) is cheaper than external equity (new common stock issues)
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
Will Dividends Ever Be the Same?
The global economic crisis has had dramatic effects on
dividend policies. According to Standard & Poor’s, com-
panies announcing dividend increases have exceeded
those announcing decreases by a factor of 15 to 1 since
1955—at least until the first 5 months of 2009. Out of
7,000 publicly traded companies, only 283 announced
dividend increases in the first quarter of 2009 while
367 cut dividends, a stunning reversal in the normal
ratio of increasers to decreasers. Even the S&P 500
companies weren’t immune to the crisis, with only 74
increasing dividends as compared with 54 cutting divi-
dends and 9 suspending dividend payments altogether.
To put this in perspective, only one S&P 500 company
cut its dividend during the first quarter of 2007. The div-
idend decreases in 2009 aren’t minor cuts, either.
Howard Silverblatt, a Senior Index Analyst at Standard
& Poor’s, estimates the cuts add up to $77 billion.
How has the market reacted to cuts by these compa-
nies? JPMorgan Chase’s stock price went up on the
announcement, presumably because investors thought
a stronger balance sheet at JPM would increase its
intrinsic value by more than the loss investors incurred
because of the lower dividend. On the other hand, GE’s
stock fell by more than 6% on the news of its 68% divi-
dend cut, perhaps because investors feared this was a
signal that GE’s plight was worse than they had
expected.
One thing is for certain, though: The days of large
“permanent” dividends are over!

Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

because it avoids flotation costs and adverse signals. This encourages firms to retain
earnings so as to avoid having to issue new stock.
When establishing a distribution policy, one size does not fit all. Some firms pro-
duce a lot of cash but have limited investment opportunities—this is true for firms in
profitable but mature industries in which few opportunities for growth exist. Such
firms typically distribute a large percentage of their cash to shareholders, thereby
attracting investment clienteles that prefer high dividends. Other firms generate little
or no excess cash because they have many good investment opportunities. Such firms
generally don’t distribute much cash but do enjoy rising earnings and stock prices,
thereby attracting investors who prefer capital gains.
As Table 14-1 suggests, dividend payouts and dividend yields for large corpora-
tions vary considerably. Generally, firms in stable, cash-producing industries such as
utilities, financial services, and tobacco pay relatively high dividends, whereas compa-
nies in rapidly growing industries such as computer software tend to pay lower
dividends.
For a given firm, the optimal distribution ratio is a function of four factors: (1)
investors’ preferences for dividends versus capital gains, (2) the firm’s investment
opportunities, (3) its target capital structure, and (4) the availability and cost of exter-
nal capital. The last three elements are combined in what we call the residual distri-
bution model. Under this model a firm follows these four steps when establishing its
target distribution ratio: (1) it determines the optimal capital budget; (2) it determines
the amount of equity needed to finance that budget, given its target capital structure
(we explain the choice of target capital structures in Chapter 15); (3) it uses rein-
vested earnings to meet equity requirements to the extent possible; and (4) it pays
dividends or repurchases stock only if more earnings are available than are needed
to support the optimal capital budget. The word residual implies “leftover,” and the
residual policy implies that distributions are paid out of “leftover” earnings.
If a firm rigidly follows the residual distribution policy, then distributions paid in
any given year can be expressed as follows:
Distributions ¼ Net income −Retained earnings needed to
finance new investments
¼ Net income −½ðTarget equity ratioÞ × ðTotal capital budgetÞ
(14-1)
As an illustration, consider the case of Texas and Western (T&W) Transport
Company, which has $60 million in net income and a target capital structure of
60% equity and 40% debt.
If T&W forecasts poor investment opportunities, then its estimated capital budget
will be only $40 million. To maintain the target capital structure, 40% ($16 million) of
this capital must be raised as debt and 60% ($24 million) must be equity. If it followed
a strict residual policy, T&W would retain $24 million of its $60 million earnings to
help finance new investments and then distribute the remaining $36 million to
shareholders:
Distributions ¼ Net income −½ðTarget equity ratioÞðTotal capital budgetÞ
¼ $60 −½ð60%Þð$40Þ
¼ $60 −$24 ¼ $36
Under this scenario, the company’s distribution ratio would be $36 million ÷ $60
million = 0.6 = 60%. These results are shown in Table 14-2.
Chapter 14: Distributions to Shareholders: Dividends and Repurchases
571

In contrast, if the company’s investment opportunities are average, its optimal
capital budget would rise to $70 million. Here it would require $42 million of retained
earnings, so distributions would be $60 −$42 = $18 million, for a ratio of $18/$60 = 30%.
Finally, if investment opportunities are good then the capital budget would be
$150 million, which would require 0.6($150) = $90 million of equity. In this case,
T&W would retain all of its net income ($60 million) and thus make no distributions.
Moreover, since the required equity exceeds the retained earnings, the company would
have to issue some new common stock to maintain the target capital structure.
Because investment opportunities and earnings will surely vary from year to year, a
strict adherence to the residual distribution policy would result in unstable distributions.
One year the firm might make no distributions because it needs the money to finance
good investment opportunities, but the next year it might make a large distribution
because investment opportunities are poor and so it does not need to retain much. Simi-
larly, fluctuating earnings could also lead to variable distributions, even if investment
opportunities were stable. Until now, we have not said whether distributions should be
in the form of dividends, stock repurchases, or some combination. The next sections
discuss specific issues associated with dividend payments and stock repurchases; this is
followed by a comparison of their relative advantages and disadvantages.

If distributions were solely in the form of dividends, then rigidly following the resid-
ual policy would lead to fluctuating, unstable dividends. Since investors dislike vola-
tile regular dividends, rs would be high and the stock price low. Therefore, firms
should proceed as follows:
1. Estimate earnings and investment opportunities, on average, for the next 5 or so
years.
2. Use this forecasted information and the target capital structure to find the
average residual model distributions and dollars of dividends during the
planning period.
3. Set a target payout ratio based on the average projected data.

Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

Thus, firms should use the residual policy to help set their long-run target distribution ratios,
but not as a guide to the distribution in any one year.
Companies often use financial forecasting models in conjunction with the residual
distribution model discussed here to help understand the determinants of an optimal
dividend policy. Most large corporations forecast their financial statements over the
next 5 to 10 years. Information on projected capital expenditures and working capital
requirements is entered into the model, along with sales forecasts, profit margins,
depreciation, and the other elements required to forecast cash flows. The target capital
structure is also specified, and the model shows the amount of debt and equity that will
be required to meet the capital budgeting requirements while maintaining the target
capital structure. Then, dividend payments are introduced. Naturally, the higher the
payout ratio, the greater the required external equity. Most companies use the model
to find a dividend pattern over the forecast period (generally 5 years) that will provide
sufficient equity to support the capital budget without forcing them to sell new com-
mon stock or move the capital structure ratios outside their optimal range.
Some companies set a very low “regular” dividend and then supplement it
with an “extra” dividend when times are good, such as Microsoft now does. This
low-regular-dividend-plus-extras policy ensures that the regular dividend can
be maintained “come hell or high water” and that stockholders can count on
receiving that dividend under all conditions. Then, when times are good and profits
and cash flows are high, the company can either pay a specially designated extra
dividend or repurchase shares of stock. Investors recognize that the extras might
not be maintained in the future, so they do not interpret them as a signal that the
companies’ earnings are going up permanently; nor do they take the elimination of
the extra as a negative signal.
Self-Test
Why is the residual model more often used to establish a long-run payout target
than to set the actual year-by-year dividend payout ratio?
How do firms use planning models to help set dividend policy?
14.9 A TALE OF TWO CASH DISTRIBUTIONS:
DIVIDENDS VERSUS STOCK REPURCHASES
Benson Conglomerate, a prestigious publishing house with several Nobel laureates
among its authors, recently began generating positive free cash flow and is analyzing
the impact of different distribution policies. Benson anticipates extremely stable cash
flows and will use the residual model to determine the level of distributions, but it
has not yet chosen the form of the distribution. In particular, Benson is comparing
distributions via dividends versus repurchases and wants to know the impact the dif-
ferent methods will have on financial statements, shareholder wealth, the number of
outstanding shares, and the stock price.
The Impact on Financial Statements
Consider first the case in which distributions are in the form of dividends. Figure 14-1
shows the most recent financial statements and the inputs we will use to forecast its
financial statements. The forecasted financial statements for the next two years are
shown in the figure. (The file Ch14 Tool Kit.xls shows four years of projected
statements.) Benson has no debt, so its interest expense is zero.
Calculations to ensure the balance sheets do in fact balance are shown in Panel d
of Figure 14-1. Required operating assets are the sum of cash, accounts receivable,

inventories, and net plant and equipment. We show balance sheets in Figure 14-1 for
both December 30 and 31 of each year; this is to better illustrate the impact of the
distribution, which we assume occurs once each year on December 31.19 Liabilities
and equity on December 30 (before the distribution) are the sum of accounts payable,
accruals, short-term debt, long-term debt, preferred stock, common stock, the previ-
ous year’s retained earnings balance, and the current year’s net income. The amount
of additional funds needed (AFN) is equal to the required operating assets minus lia-
bilities and equity. Notice that a negative AFN is projected, which indicates additional
funds are available rather than needed.
We assume that the extra funds temporarily are used to purchase short-term invest-
ments to be held until the distribution to shareholders. At that time, all short-term invest-
ments will be converted to cash and paid out as dividends. Thus, the 2011 short-term
investments total $671.6 on December 30 and drop to zero on December 31, when they
are distributed to investors.20 Observe that the retained earnings account also drops by
$671.6 on December 31 as funds that were previously retained are paid out as dividends.
Now let’s consider the case of stock repurchases. The projected income statements
and asset portion of the balance sheets are the same whether the distribution is in the
form of dividends or repurchases, but this is not true for the liabilities-and-equity side
of the balance sheet. Figure 14-2 reports the case in which distributions are in the form
of stock repurchases. As in the case of dividend distributions, the December 30 balance
of the retained earnings account is equal to the previous retained earnings balance plus
the year’s net income, because all income is retained. However, when funds in the
short-term investments account are used to repurchase stock on December 31, the
repurchase is shown as negative entry in the treasury stock account.
To summarize, the projected income statements and assets are identical whether
the distribution is made in the form of dividends or stock repurchases. There also is
no difference in liabilities. However, distributions as dividends reduce the retained
earnings account, whereas stock repurchases reduce the treasury stock account.
The Residual Distribution Model
Figures 14-1 and 14-2 illustrate the residual distribution model in Equation 14-1 as
applied to entire financial statements. The projected capital budget is equal to the net
Notes:
aAll calculations are in the file Ch14 Tool Kit.xls. Excel uses all significant digits in calculations, but numbers in the figure are
rounded and so columns may not total exactly.
bTo simplify the example, we assume that any short-term investments are held for only part of the year and earn no interest.
cA negative AFN means there are extra funds available. These are held as short-term investments through December 30. The funds
are distributed to investors on December 31, so the balance of short-term investments goes to zero on December 31.
dBecause no funds have been paid out in dividends as of December 30, the retained earnings balance for that date is equal to the
previous year’s retained earnings balance plus the current year’s net income. When short-term investments are sold and their pro-
ceeds are used to make the cash dividend payments on December 31, the balance of retained earnings is reduced by the amount of
the total dividend payments (which is equal to the reduction in short-term investments).
19As we noted earlier in the chapter, when dividends are declared, a new current liability called “divi-
dends payable” would be added to current liabilities and then retained earnings would be reduced by that
amount. To simplify the example, we ignore that provision and assume that there is no balance sheet
effect on the declaration date.
resource
See Ch14 Tool Kit.xls
on the textbook’s Web
site.
20As explained previously, there is a difference between the actual payment date and the ex-dividend date.
To simplify the example, we assume that the dividends are paid on the ex-dividend date to the share-
holder owning the stock the day before it goes ex-dividend.

addition to total operating capital from the projected balance sheets in Figure 14-1.
For example, for 2011 the capital budget is:
Capital budget ¼ ðΔCash þ ΔAccounts receivable þ ΔInventories
þΔNet plant & equipmentÞ
−ðΔAccounts payable þ ΔAccrualsÞ
¼ ð$84 −$80Þ þ ð$1;260 −$1;200Þ þ ð$1;008 −$960Þ
þð$7;140 −$6;800Þ−ð$672 −$640Þ −ð$168 −$160Þ
¼ $452 −$40 ¼ $412
With a 100% target equity ratio and net income of $1,083.6, the residual is
$1,083.6 −$412 = $671.6, as shown in Figure 14-3. Notice that this is the same as
the AFN we calculated in Figure 14-1.
The Impact of Distributions on Intrinsic Value
What is the impact of cash distributions on intrinsic value? We devote the rest of this
section to answering that question.
Free Cash Flow.
We begin by calculating expected free cash flows and perfor-
mance measures as shown in Figure 14-4. Notice that Benson’s expected return on
invested capital is greater than the cost of capital, indicating that the managers are
creating value for their shareholders. Also notice that the company is beyond its
high-growth phase, so FCF is positive and growing at a constant rate of 5%. There-
fore, Benson has cash flow available for distribution to investors.

Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

The Value of Operations.
Figure 14-4 also shows the value of operations for each
year. (See the Tool Kit for the full 4-year projections.) Recall from Chapter 13 that
we can use the projected FCFs to determine the horizon value at the end of the pro-
jections and then estimate the value of operations for each year prior to the horizon.
For Benson, the horizon value on December 31, 2012, is
Vopð12=31=12Þ ¼ FCF12=31=12ð1 þ gÞ
WACC −g
¼ $705:18ð1 þ 0:05Þ
0:12 −0:05
¼ $10;577:70
The value of operations at the end of the previous year is equal to the value of
operations 1 year ahead plus the free cash flow 1 year ahead, discounted back 1
year at the cost of capital. For example, the value of operations on December 31,
2011, is
Vopð12=31=11Þ ¼ Vopð12=31=12Þ þ FCF12=31=12
ð1 þ WACCÞ
¼ $10;577:7 þ $705:18
1 þ 0:12
¼ $10;074:00
We can repeat this process to obtain the current value of operations (i.e., as of
December 31, 2010): $9,549.29.
Notice that the choice of how to distribute the residual does not affect the
value of operations because the distribution choice does not affect the projected
free cash flows.
The Intrinsic Stock Price: Distributions as Dividends.
Figure 14-5 shows the
intrinsic stock price each year using the corporate valuation approach described in
Chapter 13. Panel a provides calculations assuming cash is distributed via divi-
dends. (See Ch14 Tool Kit.xls for projections for 4 years.) Notice that on

December 31 the intrinsic value of equity drops because the firm no longer owns
the short-term investments. This causes the intrinsic stock price also to drop. In
fact, the drop in stock price is equal to the dividend per share. For example, the
2011 dividend per share (DPS) is $0.67 and the drop in stock price is $10.75 −
$10.07 = $0.68 ≈$0.67. (The penny difference here is due to rounding in inter-
mediate steps.)
Notice that if the stock price did not fall by the amount of the DPS then there
would be an opportunity for arbitrage. If the price were to drop by less than the
DPS—say, by $0.50 to $10.25, then you could buy the stock on December 30 for
$10.75, receive a DPS of $0.67 on December 31, and then immediately sell the
stock for $10.25, reaping a sure profit of −$10.75 + $0.67 + $10.25 = $0.17. Of
course, you’d want to implement this strategy with a million shares, not just a
single share. But if everyone tried to use this strategy, the increased demand
would drive up the stock price on December 30 until there was no more sure

profit to be made. The reverse would happen if investors expected the stock price
to fall by more than the DPS.21
Here is an important observation: Even though the stock price falls, shareholder
wealth does not fall. For example, on December 30, a shareholder owns stock worth
$10.75. On December 31, the shareholder owns stock worth $10.07 but has cash of
$0.67 from the dividend, for total wealth of $10.75 (subject to rounding differences).
Thus, the shareholder’s wealth is the same before and after the dividend payment,
with the only difference being that part of the shareholder’s wealth is in the form of
cash from the dividend payment.
The Intrinsic Stock Price: Distributions as Repurchases.
Panel b of Figure 14-5
provides calculations of intrinsic value for the case in which stock is repurchased.
Observe that the intrinsic value of equity is the same for both methods of distribu-
tions, but the analysis of a repurchase is a little more complicated because the num-
ber of shares changes. The key to solving this additional complexity is to recognize
that the repurchase does not change the stock price. If the price did change due to
the repurchase, then there would be an arbitrage opportunity. For example, suppose
the stock price is expected to increase after the repurchase. If this were true, then it
should be possible for an investor to buy the stock the day before the repurchase and
then reap a reward the very next day. Current stockholders would realize this and
would refuse to sell the stock unless they were paid the price that is expected imme-
diately after the repurchase. Now suppose the stock price is expected to fall immedi-
ately after the repurchase. In this case, current shareholders should try to sell the
stock prior to the repurchase, but their actions would drive the price down to the
price that is expected after the repurchase. As this “thought experiment” shows, the
repurchase itself does not change the stock price.
In summary, the events leading up to a repurchase generate cash (the sale of a divi-
sion, a recapitalization, or the generation of high free cash flows from operations). Gen-
erating cash can certainly change the stock price, but the repurchase itself doesn’t change
the stock price. We can use this fact to determine the number of shares repurchased.
First, though, we must define some notation.
nPrior ¼The number of shares outstanding prior to the repurchase:
nPost ¼The number of shares outstanding after the repurchase:
SPrior ¼The intrinsic value of equity prior to the repurchase:
SPost ¼The intrinsic value of equity after the repurchase:
PPrior ¼The intrinsic stock price prior to the repurchase:
PPost ¼The intrinsic stock price after the repurchase:
P¼PPrior ¼PPost ¼The intrinsic stock price during; before; and after the repurchase:
CashRep ¼The amount of cash used to repurchase shares:
As we explained, the repurchase itself doesn’t change the stock price. Therefore,
the number of shares repurchased is equal to the amount of cash used to repurchase
stocks divided by the stock price:
Number of shares repurchased ¼ nPrior −nPost ¼ CashRep
PPrior
(14-2)
21We ignore taxes in this description. Empirical evidence suggests that the actual drop in stock price is
equal to about 90% of the DPS, with all pre-tax profit being eliminated by taxes.

(14-3)
For example, as shown in Panel b of Figure 14-5, the intrinsic stock price on December
30, 2011, the day before the repurchase, is $10.75, and there are 1,000 shares of stock.
Using Equation 14-3, the number of shares after the repurchase is equal to:
nPost ¼ nPrior −CashRep
PPrior
¼ 1;000 −$671:6
$10:75
¼ 1;000 −62:47 ¼ 937:5
Panel b of Figure 14-5 also shows that on December 31, 2011, the intrinsic value
of equity prior to the repurchase, SPrior, drops from $10,745.6 to a value after the
repurchase, SPost, of $10,074.0. This decrease in the intrinsic value of equity is equal
to the amount of the cash used in the repurchase, $671.6. However, the stock price
remains at $10.75 after the repurchase because the number of shares also drops:
PPost ¼ SPost
nPost
¼ $10;074
937:5 ¼ $10:75
How does the repurchase affect shareholder wealth? The aggregate value of out-
standing stock drops after the repurchase, but the aggregate wealth of the share-
holders remains unchanged. Before the repurchase, shareholders own a total of
equity worth SPrior, $10,745.6. After the repurchase, shareholders own a total of
equity worth SPost, $10,074, but they also own cash (received in the repurchase) in
the amount of $671.6, for a total wealth of $10,745.6. Thus, the repurchase does
not change shareholders’ aggregate wealth, it only changes the form in which they
hold wealth (all stock versus a combination of stock and cash).
Comparing Intrinsic Stock Prices: Distributions as Repurchases.
The chart
at the top of Figure 14-5 shows the projected intrinsic stock prices for the two differ-
ent distribution methods. Notice that the prices begin at the same level (because
Benson has not yet begun making any distributions). The price for the repurchase
scenario climbs smoothly and grows to a higher level than does the price for the div-
idend scenario, which drops by the DPS each time it is paid. However, the number
of shares falls in the repurchase scenario. As shown in Rows 277 and 289 of the
figure, the intrinsic values of equity are identical for both distribution methods.
This example illustrates three key results: (1) Ignoring possible tax effects and sig-
nals, the total market value of equity will be the same whether a firm pays dividends
or repurchases stock. (2) The repurchase itself does not change the stock price
Chapter 14: Distributions to Shareholders: Dividends and Repurchases
581

(compared with using the cash to buy marketable securities) at the time of the repur-
chase, although it does reduce the number of outstanding shares. (3) Because a com-
pany that repurchases stock will have fewer shares than an otherwise identical
company that pays dividends, the stock price of a repurchasing company will climb
faster than that of the dividend-paying company. However, the total return to the
two companies’ shareholders will be the same.22
Self-Test
Explain how a repurchase changes the number of shares but not the stock price.
A firm’s most recent FCF was $2.4 million, and its FCF is expected to grow at a constant
rate of 5%. The firm’s WACC is 14% and it has 2 million shares outstanding. The firm
has $12 million in short-term investments that it plans to liquidate and then distribute in
a stock repurchase; the firm has no other financial investments or debt. Verify that the
value of operations is $28 million. Immediately prior to the repurchase, what are the
intrinsic value of equity and the intrinsic stock price? ($40 million; $20/share) How many
shares will be repurchased? (0.6 million) How many shares will remain after the repur-
chase? (1.4 million) Immediately after the repurchase, what are the intrinsic value of
equity and the intrinsic stock price? ($28 million; $20/share)
14.10 THE PROS AND CONS OF DIVIDENDS
AND REPURCHASES
The advantages of repurchases can be listed as follows.
1. Repurchase announcements are viewed as positive signals by investors because
the repurchase is often motivated by management’s belief that the firm’s shares
are undervalued.
2. Stockholders have a choice when the firm distributes cash by repurchasing stock
—they can sell or not sell. Those stockholders who need cash can sell back some
of their shares while others can simply retain their stock. With a cash dividend,
on the other hand, stockholders must accept a dividend payment.
3. Dividends are “sticky” in the short run because management is usually reluctant
to raise the dividend if the increase cannot be maintained in the future, and cut-
ting cash dividends is always avoided because of the negative signal it gives.
Hence, if the excess cash flow is thought to be only temporary, management may
prefer making the distribution in the form of a stock repurchase to declaring an
increased cash dividend that cannot be maintained.
4. Companies can use the residual model to set a target cash distribution level and
then divide the distribution into a dividend component and a repurchase component.
The dividend payout ratio will be relatively low, but the dividend itself will be
relatively secure, and it will grow as a result of the declining number of shares
outstanding. The company has more flexibility in adjusting the total distribution
than it would if the entire distribution were in the form of cash dividends,

Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

because repurchases can be varied from year to year without giving off adverse
signals. This procedure, which is what Florida Power & Light employed, has
much to recommend it, and it is one reason for the dramatic increase in the total
volume of stock repurchases.
5. Repurchases can be used to produce large-scale changes in capital structures. For
example, several years ago Consolidated Edison decided to borrow $400 million
and use the funds to repurchase some of its common stock. Thus, Con Ed was
able to quickly change its capital structure.
6. Companies that use stock options as an important component of employee com-
pensation usually repurchase shares in the secondary market and then use those
shares when employees exercise their options. This technique allows companies
to avoid issuing new shares and thus diluting earnings.
Repurchases have three principal disadvantages.
1. Stockholders may not be indifferent between dividends and capital gains, and the
price of the stock might benefit more from cash dividends than from repurchases.
Cash dividends are generally dependable, but repurchases are not.
2. The selling stockholders may not be fully aware of all the implications of a
repurchase, or they may not have all the pertinent information about the
corporation’s present and future activities. However, in order to avoid poten-
tial stockholder suits, firms generally announce repurchase programs before
embarking on them.
3. The corporation may pay too much for the repurchased stock—to the disadvan-
tage of remaining stockholders. If the firm seeks to acquire a relatively large
amount of its stock, then the price may be bid above its equilibrium level and
then fall after the firm ceases its repurchase operations.
When all the pros and cons on stock repurchases versus dividends have been
totaled, where do we stand? Our conclusions may be summarized as follows.
1. Because of the deferred tax on capital gains, repurchases have a tax advantage
over dividends as a way to distribute income to stockholders. This advantage is
reinforced by the fact that repurchases provide cash to stockholders who want
cash while allowing those who do not need current cash to delay its receipt. On
the other hand, dividends are more dependable and thus are better suited for
those who need a steady source of income.
2. The danger of signaling effects requires that a company not have volatile
dividend payments, which would lower investors’ confidence in the company and
adversely affect its cost of equity and its stock price. However, cash flows vary
over time, as do investment opportunities, so the “proper” dividend in the resid-
ual model sense varies. To get around this problem, a company can set its
dividend low enough to keep dividend payments from constraining operations
and then use repurchases on a more or less regular basis to distribute excess cash.
Such a procedure will provide regular, dependable dividends plus additional cash
flow to those stockholders who want it.
3. Repurchases are also useful when a firm wants to make a large shift in its capital
structure, wants to distribute cash from a one-time event such as the sale of a
division, or wants to obtain shares for use in an employee stock option plan.

14.11 OTHER FACTORS INFLUENCING DISTRIBUTIONS
In this section, we discuss several other factors that affect the dividend decision.
These factors may be grouped into two broad categories: (1) constraints on dividend
payments and (2) availability and cost of alternative sources of capital.
Constraints
Constraints on dividend payments can affect distributions, as the following examples
illustrate.
1. Bond indentures. Debt contracts often limit dividend payments to earnings gener-
ated after the loan was granted. Also, debt contracts often stipulate that no divi-
dends can be paid unless the current ratio, times-interest-earned ratio, and other
safety ratios exceed stated minimums.
2. Preferred stock restrictions. Typically, common dividends cannot be paid if the
company has omitted its preferred dividend. The preferred arrearages must be
satisfied before common dividends can be resumed.
3. Impairment of capital rule. Dividend payments cannot exceed the balance sheet
item “retained earnings.” This legal restriction, known as the “impairment of
capital rule,” is designed to protect creditors. Without the rule, a company in
trouble might distribute most of its assets to stockholders and leave its debt-
holders out in the cold. (Liquidating dividends can be paid out of capital, but they
must be indicated as such and must not reduce capital below the limits stated in
debt contracts.)
4. Availability of cash. Cash dividends can be paid only with cash, so a shortage of
cash in the bank can restrict dividend payments. However, the ability to borrow
can offset this factor.
Dividend Yields around the World
Dividend yields vary considerably in different stock
markets throughout the world. In 1999, dividend yields
in the United States averaged 1.6% for the large blue-
chip stocks in the Dow Jones Industrials, 1.2% for a
broader sample of stocks in the S&P 500, and 0.3% for
stocks in the Nasdaq, where high-tech firms predomi-
nate. Outside the United States, average dividend yields
ranged from 5.7% in New Zealand to 0.7% in Taiwan.

ture in 1999.

Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

5. Penalty tax on improperly accumulated earnings. To prevent wealthy individuals
from using corporations to avoid personal taxes, the Tax Code provides for a
special surtax on improperly accumulated income. Thus, if the IRS can demon-
strate that a firm’s dividend payout ratio is being deliberately held down to help
its stockholders avoid personal taxes, the firm is subject to heavy penalties. This
factor is generally relevant only to privately owned firms.
Alternative Sources of Capital
The second factor that influences the dividend decision is the cost and availability of
alternative sources of capital.
1. Cost of selling new stock. If a firm needs to finance a given level of investment, it can
obtain equity by retaining earnings or by issuing new common stock. If flotation
costs (including any negative signaling effects of a stock offering) are high then re
will be well above rs, making it better to set a low payout ratio and to finance
through retention rather than through the sale of new common stock. On the
other hand, a high dividend payout ratio is more feasible for a firm whose flotation
costs are low. Flotation costs differ among firms—for example, the flotation
percentage is generally higher for small firms, so they tend to set low payout ratios.
2. Ability to substitute debt for equity. A firm can finance a given level of investment
with either debt or equity. As just described, low stock flotation costs permit a
more flexible dividend policy because equity can be raised either by retaining
earnings or by selling new stock. A similar situation holds for debt policy: If the
firm can adjust its debt ratio without raising costs sharply, then it can pay the
expected dividend—even if earnings fluctuate—by increasing its debt ratio.
3. Control. If management is concerned about maintaining control, it may be reluc-
tant to sell new stock; hence the company may retain more earnings than it
otherwise would. However, if stockholders want higher dividends and a proxy
fight looms, then the dividend will be increased.

How do the availability and cost of outside capital affect dividend policy?
14.12 SUMMARIZING THE DISTRIBUTION POLICY DECISION
In practice, the distribution decision is made jointly with capital structure and capital
budgeting decisions. The underlying reason for joining these decisions is asymmetric
information, which influences managerial actions in two ways.
1. In general, managers do not want to issue new common stock. First, new com-
mon stock involves issuance costs—commissions, fees, and so on—and those costs
can be avoided by using retained earnings to finance equity needs. Second, as we
will explain in Chapter 15, asymmetric information causes investors to view new
common stock issues as negative signals and thus lowers expectations regarding
the firm’s future prospects. The end result is that the announcement of a new
stock issue usually leads to a decrease in the stock price. Considering the total
costs due to issuance and asymmetric information, managers prefer to use
retained earnings as the primary source of new equity.
2. Dividend changes provide signals about managers’ beliefs concerning their
firms’ future prospects. Thus, dividend reductions generally have a significant
negative effect on a firm’s stock price. Since managers recognize this, they try to
Chapter 14: Distributions to Shareholders: Dividends and Repurchases
585

set dollar dividends low enough that there is only a remote chance the dividend
will have to be reduced in the future.
The effects of asymmetric information suggest that, to the extent possible,
managers should avoid both new common stock sales and dividend cuts, because
both actions tend to lower the stock price. Thus, in setting distribution policy,
managers should begin by considering the firm’s future investment opportunities
relative to its projected internal sources of funds. The target capital structure also
plays a part, but because it is a range, firms can vary their actual capital structures
somewhat from year to year. Since it is best to avoid issuing new common stock,
the target long-term payout ratio should be designed to permit the firm to meet all
of its equity capital requirements with retained earnings. In effect, managers should use
the residual model to set dividends, but in a long-term framework. Finally, the current
dollar dividend should be set so that there is an extremely low probability that the
dividend, once set, will ever have to be lowered or omitted.
Of course, the dividend decision is made during the planning process, so there is
uncertainty about future investment opportunities and operating cash flows. The
actual payout ratio in any year will therefore likely be above or below the firm’s
long-range target. However, the dollar dividend should be maintained, or increased
as planned, unless the firm’s financial condition deteriorates to the point at which the
planned policy simply cannot be maintained. A steady or increasing stream of divi-
dends over the long run signals that the firm’s financial condition is under control.
Moreover, investor uncertainty is decreased by stable dividends, so a steady dividend
stream reduces the negative effect of a new stock issue—should one become abso-
lutely necessary.
In general, firms with superior investment opportunities should set lower payouts,
and hence retain more earnings, than firms with poor investment opportunities. The
degree of uncertainty also influences the decision. If there is a great deal of uncer-
tainty regarding the forecasts of free cash flows, which are defined here as the firm’s
operating cash flows minus mandatory equity investments, then it is best to be con-
servative and to set a lower current dollar dividend. Also, firms with postponable
investment opportunities can afford to set a higher dollar dividend, because in times
of stress investments can be postponed for a year or two, thus increasing the cash
available for dividends. Finally, firms whose cost of capital is largely unaffected by
changes in the debt ratio can also afford to set a higher payout ratio, because in times
of stress they can more easily issue additional debt to maintain the capital budgeting
program without having to cut dividends or issue stock.
The net result of these factors is that many firms’ dividend policies are consistent
with the life-cycle theory in which younger firms with many investment opportu-
nities but relatively low cash flows reinvest their earnings so that they can avoid the
large flotation costs associated with raising external capital.23 As firms mature and
begin to generate more cash flow, they tend to pay more dividends and issue more
debt as a way to “bond” their cash flows (as described in Chapter 15) and thereby
reduce the agency costs of free cash flow.
What do executives think? A recent survey indicates financial executives believe
that it is extremely important to maintain dividends but much less important to initi-
ate or increase dividend payments. In general, they view the cash distribution deci-
sion as being much less important than capital budgeting decisions. Managers like

Policy and the Earned/Contributed Capital Mix: A Test of the Life-Cycle Theory,” Journal of Financial
Economics, August 2006, pp. 227–254.

Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

the flexibility provided by repurchases instead of regular dividends. They tend to
repurchase shares when they believe their stock price is undervalued, and they believe
that shareholders view repurchases as positive signals. In general, the different taxa-
tion of dividends and repurchases is not a major factor when a company chooses how
to distribute cash to investors.24

14.13 STOCK SPLITS AND STOCK DIVIDENDS
The rationale for stock splits and dividends can best be explained through an example.
We will use Porter Electronic Controls Inc., a $700 million electronic components
manufacturer, for this purpose. Since its inception, Porter’s markets have been expand-
ing, and the company has enjoyed growth in sales and earnings. Some of its earnings
have been paid out in dividends, but some are also retained each year, causing its earn-
ings per share and stock price to grow. The company began its life with only a few
thousand shares outstanding, and after some years of growth the stock price was high.
Porter’s CFO thought this high price limited the number of investors who could buy
the stock, which reduced demand for the stock and thus kept the firm’s total market
value below what it could be if there were more shares, at a lower price, outstanding.
To correct this situation, Porter “split its stock,” as we describe next.
Stock Splits
Although there is little empirical evidence to support the contention, there is neverthe-
less a widespread belief in financial circles that an optimal price range exists for stocks.
“Optimal” means that if the price is within this range, the firm’s value will be maxi-
mized. Many observers, including Porter’s management, believe the best range for
most stocks is from $20 to $80 per share. Accordingly, if the price of Porter’s stock
rose to $80, management would probably declare a 2-for-1 stock split, thus doubling
the number of shares outstanding, halving the earnings and dividends per share, and
thereby lowering the stock price. Each stockholder would have more shares, but each
share would be worth less. If the post-split price were $40, then Porter’s stockholders
would be exactly as well off as before the split. However, if the stock price were to sta-
bilize above $40, stockholders would be better off. Stock splits can be of any size—for
example, the stock could be split 2-for-1, 3-for-1, 1.5-for-1, or in any other way.
Sometimes a company will have a reverse split. For example, International Pic-
tures Corp. (IPIX) developed the iPIX computer imaging technology, which allows
a user to “walk through” a 360-degree view. Its stock price was in the $30 range
prior to the dot-com crash of April 2000, but by August 2001 its price had fallen to
$0.20 per share. One of Nasdaq’s listing requirements is that the stock price must be
above $1 per share, and Nasdaq was threatening to delist IPIX. To drive its price up,
IPIX had a 1-10 reverse stock split before trading began on August 23, 2001, with its
shareholders exchanging 10 shares of stock for a single new share. In theory, the
stock price should have increased by a factor of 10, to around $2, but IPIX closed
that day at a price of $1.46. Evidently, investors saw the reverse split as a negative
signal. IPIX continued to struggle and declared bankruptcy in 2006, eventually
auctioning off virtually all of its assets.

Century,” Journal of Financial Economics, September 2005, pp. 483–527.
Chapter 14: Distributions to Shareholders: Dividends and Repurchases
587

Stock Dividends
Stock dividends are similar to stock splits in that they “divide the pie into smaller
slices” without affecting the fundamental position of the current stockholders. On a
5% stock dividend, the holder of 100 shares would receive an additional 5 shares
(without cost); on a 20% stock dividend, the same holder would receive 20 new
shares; and so on. Again, the total number of shares is increased, so earnings, divi-
dends, and price per share all decline.
If a firm wants to reduce the price of its stock, should it use a stock split or a
stock dividend? Stock splits are generally used after a sharp price run-up to pro-
duce a large price reduction. Stock dividends used on a regular annual basis will
keep the stock price more or less constrained. For example, if a firm’s earnings
and dividends were growing at about 10% per year, its stock price would tend to
go up at about that same rate, and it would soon be outside the desired trading
range. A 10% annual stock dividend would maintain the stock price within the
optimal trading range. Note, however, that small stock dividends create bookkeep-
ing problems and unnecessary expenses, so firms today use stock splits far more
often than stock dividends.25
Effect on Stock Prices
If a company splits its stock or declares a stock dividend, will this increase the market
value of its stock? Many empirical studies have sought to answer this question. Here
is a summary of their findings.
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
Talk about a Split Personality!
Sun Microsystems once was among the highest of the
high-flying companies in the tech boom of the 1990s.
Sun went public in 1986 and its stock price grew rap-
idly, with Sun declaring seven different 2-1 stock splits
between 1988 and 2000. Without these splits, Sun’s
stock price would have grown from about $30 in late
1988 to over $1,700 in mid-2000, a staggering return of
over 40% per year! However, Sun’s fortunes fell when
the tech bubble burst, and Sun never recovered. With
its stock price languishing around $5, Sun declared a
1-4 reverse stock split in late 2007, which boosted the
stock price to over $20, but subsequently it sank into
the $3–$4 range by the spring of 2009. In April 2009,
Sun announced that it had agreed to be acquired by
Oracle for about $9.50 per share. This would have
been only $2.375 = $9.50/4 if not for the reverse split
in 2007, quite a fall from its former highs.
Reverse splits were rare when Sun Microsystems
declared its split in 2007, but now Sun might have plenty
of company caused by the economic crisis. In May 2009,
many firms were considering reverse splits, including
AIG, GM, Rite Aid, and Citigroup. In fact, over 340 compa-
nies had stock prices of less than a dollar per share in May
2009, including such familiar names as Sirius XM Radio,
Vonage, and Blockbuster. Because so many firms have
such low stock prices, the NYSE and Nasdaq temporarily
suspended their requirement that listed companies main-
tain a stock price of over $1 per share.
25Accountants treat stock splits and stock dividends somewhat differently. For example, in a 2-for-1 stock
split, the number of shares outstanding is doubled and the par value is halved, and that’s about all there is
to it. With a stock dividend, a bookkeeping entry is made transferring “retained earnings” to “common
stock..”
588
Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

1. On average, the price of a company’s stock rises shortly after it announces a stock
split or a stock dividend.
2. However, these price increases are probably due to signaling rather than a desire
for stock splits or dividends per se. Only managers who think future earnings will
be higher tend to split stocks, so investors often view the announcement of a
stock split as a positive signal. Thus, it is the signal of favorable prospects for
earnings and dividends that causes the price to increase.
3. If a company announces a stock split or stock dividend, its price will tend to
rise. However, if during the next few months it does not announce an increase
in earnings and dividends, then its stock price will drop back to the earlier
level.
4. As we noted earlier, brokerage commissions are generally higher in percentage
terms on lower-priced stocks. This means that it is more expensive to trade
low-priced than high-priced stocks—which, in turn, means that stock splits may
reduce the liquidity of a company’s shares. This particular piece of evidence
suggests that stock splits/dividends might actually be harmful, although a lower
price does mean that more investors can afford to trade in round lots (100
shares), which carry lower commissions than do odd lots (fewer than 100
shares).
What can we conclude from all this? From a purely economic standpoint, stock
dividends and splits are just additional pieces of paper. However, they provide man-
agement with a relatively low-cost way of signaling that the firm’s prospects look
good.26 Further, we should note that since few large, publicly owned stocks sell at
prices above several hundred dollars, we simply do not know what the effect would
be if Microsoft, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, and other highly successful firms had
never split their stocks and consequently sold at prices in the thousands or even
tens of thousands of dollars. All in all, it probably makes sense to employ stock splits
(or stock dividends) when a firm’s prospects are favorable, especially if the price of its
stock has gone beyond the normal trading range.27

had a stock split, and its stock (BRKa) sold on the NYSE for $85,500 per share in March 2009. Yet in
response to investment trusts that were being formed in 1996 to sell fractional units of the stock and
thus—in effect—split it, Buffett himself created a new class of Berkshire Hathaway stock (Class B) worth
about 1/30 of a Class A (regular) share.

14.14 DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLANS
During the 1970s, most large companies instituted dividend reinvestment plans
(DRIPs), under which stockholders can choose to automatically reinvest their divi-
dends in the stock of the paying corporation. Today most large companies offer
DRIPs; participation rates vary considerably, but about 25% of the average firm’s
shareholders are enrolled. There are two types of DRIPs: (1) plans that involve only
“old stock” that is already outstanding and (2) plans that involve newly issued stock.
In either case, the stockholder must pay taxes on the amount of the dividends, even
though stock rather than cash is received.
Under both types of DRIPs, stockholders choose between continuing to receive
dividend checks or having the company use the dividends to buy more stock in the cor-
poration. Under the “old stock” type of plan, if a stockholder elects reinvestment then a
bank, acting as trustee, takes the total funds available for reinvestment, purchases the cor-
poration’s stock on the open market, and allocates the shares purchased to the participat-
ing stockholders’ accounts on a pro rata basis. The transaction costs of buying shares
(brokerage costs) are low because of volume purchases, so these plans benefit small
stockholders who do not need cash dividends for current consumption.
The “new stock” type of DRIP uses the reinvested funds to buy newly issued stock;
hence these plans raise new capital for the firm. AT&T, Union Carbide, and many other
companies have used new stock plans to raise substantial amounts of new equity capital.
No fees are charged to stockholders, and many companies offer stock at a discount of
3% to 5% below the actual market price. The companies offer discounts as a trade-off
against flotation costs that would have been incurred if new stock had been issued
through investment bankers instead of through the dividend reinvestment plans.
One interesting aspect of DRIPs is that they cause corporations to re-examine
their basic dividend policies. A high participation rate in a DRIP suggests that stock-
holders might be better off if the firm simply reduced cash dividends, which would
save stockholders some personal income taxes. Quite a few firms are surveying their
stockholders to learn more about their preferences and to find out how they would
react to a change in dividend policy. A more rational approach to basic dividend pol-
icy decisions may emerge from this research.
Note that companies start or stop using new stock DRIPs depending on their need
for equity capital. For example, Union Carbide and AT&T recently stopped offering
new stock DRIPs with a 5% discount because their needs for equity capital declined.
Some companies have expanded their DRIPs by moving to “open enrollment,”
whereby anyone can purchase the firm’s stock directly and thus bypass brokers’ com-
missions. ExxonMobil not only allows investors to buy their initial shares at no fee
but also lets them pick up additional shares through automatic bank account withdra-
wals. Several plans, including ExxonMobil’s, offer dividend reinvestment for individ-
ual retirement accounts, and some, such as U.S. West’s, allow participants to invest
weekly or monthly rather than on the quarterly dividend schedule. In all of these
plans, and many others, stockholders can invest more than the dividends they are for-
going—they simply send a check to the company and buy shares without a brokerage
commission. According to First Chicago Trust, which handles the paperwork for
13 million shareholder DRIP accounts, at least half of all DRIPs will offer open en-
rollment, extra purchases, and other expanded services within the next few years.

Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

Summary
•
Distribution policy involves three issues: (1) What fraction of earnings should
be distributed? (2) Should the distribution be in the form of cash dividends or
stock repurchases? (3) Should the firm maintain a steady, stable dividend
growth rate?
•
The optimal distribution policy strikes a balance between current dividends
and future growth so as to maximize the firm’s stock price.
•
Miller and Modigliani (MM) developed the dividend irrelevance theory, which
holds that a firm’s dividend policy has no effect on either the value of its stock or
its cost of capital.
•
The dividend preference theory, also called the bird-in-the-hand theory,
holds that the firm’s value will be maximized by a high dividend payout ratio,
because investors regard cash dividends as being less risky than potential
capital gains.
•
The tax effect theory states that because long-term capital gains are subject to
lower taxes than dividends, investors prefer to have companies retain earnings
rather than pay them out as dividends.
•
Dividend policy should take account of the information content of dividends
(signaling) and the clientele effect. The information content, or signaling,
effect stems from investors regarding an unexpected dividend change as a signal
of management’s forecast of future earnings. The clientele effect suggests that a
firm will attract investors who like the firm’s dividend payout policy. Both factors
should be taken into account by firms that are considering a change in dividend
policy.
•
In practice, dividend-paying firms follow a policy of paying a steadily increasing
dividend. This policy provides investors with stable, dependable income, and
departures from it give investors signals about management’s expectations for
future earnings.
•
Most firms use the residual distribution model to set the long-run target dis-
tribution ratio at a level that will permit the firm to meet its equity requirements
with retained earnings.
•
Under a stock repurchase plan, a firm buys back some of its outstanding stock,
thereby decreasing the number of shares but leaving the stock price unchanged.
•
Legal constraints, investment opportunities, availability and cost of funds
from other sources, and taxes are also considered when firms establish dividend
policies.
•
A stock split increases the number of shares outstanding. Normally, splits
reduce the price per share in proportion to the increase in shares because splits
merely “divide the pie into smaller slices.” However, firms generally split their
stocks only if (1) the price is quite high and (2) management thinks the future is
bright. Therefore, stock splits are often taken as positive signals and thus boost
stock prices.
•
A stock dividend is a dividend paid in additional shares rather than in cash. Both
stock dividends and splits are used to keep stock prices within an “optimal”
trading range.
•
A dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) allows stockholders to have the
company automatically use dividends to purchase additional shares. DRIPs are
popular because they allow stockholders to acquire additional shares without
brokerage fees.

Residual Distribution
Policy
The Welch Company is considering three independent projects, each of which re-

of capital for these projects are as follows:
Project H (high risk):
Cost of capital = 16%; IRR = 20%
Project M (medium risk):
Cost of capital = 12%; IRR = 10%
Project L (low risk):
Cost of capital = 8%; IRR =
9%
Note that the projects’ cost of capital varies because the projects have different levels
of risk. The company’s optimal capital structure calls for 50% debt and 50% com-
mon equity. Welch expects to have net income of $7,287,500. If Welch bases its
dividends on the residual model (all distributions are in the form of dividends), what
will its payout ratio be?

Alternative Dividend
Policies
In 2010, the Keenan Company paid dividends totaling $3.6 million on net income of
$10.8 million. The year was a normal one, and earnings have grown at a constant
rate of 10% for the past 10 years. However, in 2011, earnings are expected to jump
to $14.4 million, and the firm expects to have profitable investment opportunities of
$8.4 million. It is predicted that Keenan will not be able to maintain the 2011 level of
earnings growth—the high 2011 projected earnings level is due to an exceptionally
profitable new product line to be introduced that year—and then the company will
return to its previous 10% growth rate. Keenan’s target debt ratio is 40%.
a. Calculate Keenan’s total dividends for 2011 if it follows each of the following
policies:
(1)
Its 2011 dividend payment is set to force dividends to grow at the
long-run growth rate in earnings.
(2)
It continues the 2010 dividend payout ratio.
(3)
It uses a pure residual policy with all distributions in the form of
dividends (40% of the $8.4 million investment is financed with debt).
(4)
It employs a regular-dividend-plus-extras policy, with the regular
dividend being based on the long-run growth rate and the extra
dividend being set according to the residual policy.
b. Which of the preceding policies would you recommend? Restrict your choices to
the ones listed, but justify your answer.
c. Does a 2011 dividend of $9 million seem reasonable in view of your answers to
parts a and b? If not, should the dividend be higher or lower?

equity outstanding, and its net income is $8 million. The company forecasts it would
require $10 million to fund all of its profitable (i.e., positive-NPV) projects for the
upcoming year.
a. If Buena Terra follows the residual model and makes all distributions as divi-
dends, how much retained earnings will it need to fund its capital budget?
b. If Buena Terra follows the residual model with all distributions in the form of
dividends, what will be the company’s dividend per share and payout ratio for the
upcoming year?
c. If Buena Terra maintains its current $3 DPS for next year, how much retained
earnings will be available for the firm’s capital budget?
d. Can the company maintain its current capital structure, maintain the $3 DPS,
and maintain a $10 million capital budget without having to raise new common
stock?
e. Suppose Buena Terra’s management is firmly opposed to cutting the dividend;
that is, it wishes to maintain the $3 dividend for the next year. Suppose also that
the company is committed to funding all profitable projects and is willing to is-
sue more debt (along with the available retained earnings) to help finance the
company’s capital budget. Assume the resulting change in capital structure has a
minimal impact on the company’s composite cost of capital, so that the capital
budget remains at $10 million. What portion of this year’s capital budget would
have to be financed with debt?
f.
Suppose once again that Buena Terra’s management wants to maintain the $3
DPS. In addition, the company wants to maintain its target capital structure
(60% equity, 40% debt) and its $10 million capital budget. What is the mini-
mum dollar amount of new common stock the company would have to issue in
order to meet all of its objectives?
g. Now consider the case in which Buena Terra’s management wants to maintain
the $3 DPS and its target capital structure but also wants to avoid issuing new
common stock. The company is willing to cut its capital budget in order to meet
its other objectives. Assuming the company’s projects are divisible, what will be
the company’s capital budget for the next year?
h. If a firm follows the residual distribution policy, what actions can it take when its
forecasted retained earnings are less than the retained earnings required to fund
its capital budget?

Mini Case
Southeastern Steel Company (SSC) was formed 5 years ago to exploit a new continuous cast-
ing process. SSC’s founders, Donald Brown and Margo Valencia, had been employed in the
research department of a major integrated-steel company, but when that company decided
against using the new process (which Brown and Valencia had developed), they decided to
strike out on their own. One advantage of the new process was that it required relatively little
capital in comparison with the typical steel company, so Brown and Valencia have been able to
avoid issuing new stock and thus own all of the shares. However, SSC has now reached the
stage at which outside equity capital is necessary if the firm is to achieve its growth targets.
Therefore, Brown and Valencia have decided to take the company public. Until now, Brown
and Valencia have paid themselves reasonable salaries but routinely reinvested all after-tax
earnings in the firm, so dividend policy has not been an issue. However, before talking with
potential outside investors, they must decide on a dividend policy.
Assume you were recently hired by Pierce Westerfield Carney (PWC), a national consult-
ing firm that has been asked to help SSC prepare for its public offering. Martha Millon, the
senior PWC consultant in your group, has asked you to make a presentation to Brown and
Valencia in which you review the theory of dividend policy and discuss the following issues.
a. (1) What is meant by the term “distribution policy”? How has the mix of dividend
payouts and stock repurchases changed over time?
(2) The terms “irrelevance,” “dividend preference, or bird-in-the-hand,” and “tax
effect” have been used to describe three major theories regarding the way dividend
payouts affect a firm’s value. Explain what these terms mean, and briefly describe
each theory.
(3) What do the three theories indicate regarding the actions management should take
with respect to dividend payouts?
(4) What results have empirical studies of the dividend theories produced? How does
all this affect what we can tell managers about dividend payouts?
b. Discuss (1) the information content, or signaling, hypothesis, (2) the clientele effect,
and (3) their effects on distribution policy.
c. (1) Assume that SSC has completed its IPO and has a $112.5 million capital budget
planned for the coming year. You have determined that its present capital structure
(80% equity and 20% debt) is optimal, and its net income is forecasted at $140 million.
Use the residual distribution approach to determine SSC’s total dollar distribution.

Assume for now that the distribution is in the form of a dividend. Suppose SSC has 100
million shares of stock outstanding. What is the forecasted dividend payout ratio? What
is the forecasted dividend per share? What would happen to the payout ratio and DPS
if net income were forecasted to decrease to $90 million? To increase to $160 million?
(2) In general terms, how would a change in investment opportunities affect the payout
ratio under the residual distribution policy?
(3) What are the advantages and disadvantages of the residual policy? (Hint: Don’t
neglect signaling and clientele effects.)
d. (1) Describe the procedures a company follows when it make a distribution through
dividend payments.
(2) What is a stock repurchase? Describe the procedures a company follows when it
make a distribution through a stock repurchase.
e. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a firm repurchasing its own shares.
f. Suppose SSC has decided to distribute $50 million, which it presently is holding in very
liquid short-term investments. SSC’s value of operations is estimated to be about
$1,937.5 million, and it has $387.5 million in debt (it has no preferred stock). As men-
tioned previously, SSC has 100 million shares of stock outstanding.
(1) Assume that SSC has not yet made the distribution. What is SSC’s intrinsic value of
equity? What is its intrinsic stock price per share?
(2) Now suppose that SSC has just made the $50 million distribution in the form of
dividends. What is SSC’s intrinsic value of equity? What is its intrinsic stock price
per share?
(3) Suppose instead that SSC has just made the $50 million distribution in the form of a
stock repurchase. Now what is SSC’s intrinsic value of equity? How many shares
did SSC repurchase? How many shares remained outstanding after the repurchase?
What is its intrinsic stock price per share after the repurchase?
g. Describe the series of steps that most firms take when setting dividend policy.
h. What are stock splits and stock dividends? What are the advantages and disadvantages
of each?
i. What is a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP), and how does it work?

question may sound like the first line of a joke, the answer isn’t very funny
for many companies. An economic bankruptcy means that the market value
of a company’s assets (which is determined by the cash flows those assets
are expected to produce) is less than the amount owed to creditors. A legal
bankruptcy occurs when a filing is made in bankruptcy court to protect a
company from its creditors until an orderly reorganization or liquidation can be
arranged.
A liquidity crisis occurs when a company doesn’t have access to enough cash
to make payments to creditors as the payments come due in the near future. In
normal times, a strong company (one whose market value of assets far exceeds
the amount owed to creditors) can usually borrow money in the short-term credit
markets to meet any urgent liquidity needs. Thus, a liquidity crisis usually doesn’t
trigger a bankruptcy.
However, 2008 and the first half of 2009 were anything but usual. Many
companies had loaded up on debt during the boom years prior to 2007, and
much of that was short-term debt. When the mortgage crisis began in late 2007
and spread like wildfire through the financial sector, many financial institutions
virtually stopped providing short-term credit as they tried to stave off their own
bankruptcies. As a result, many nonfinancial companies faced liquidity crises.
Even worse, consumer demand began to drop and investors’ risk aversion began
to rise, leading to falling market values of assets and triggering economic and legal
bankruptcy for many companies.
Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual each filed for bankruptcy in 2008
and have the distinction of being the two largest firms to fail, with assets of $691
billion and $328 billion, respectively. But the economic crisis has claimed plenty of
nonfinancial firms, too, such as General Motors, Chrysler, Masonite Corporation,
Trump Entertainment Resorts, Pilgrim’s Pride, and Circuit City.
Many other companies are scrambling to reduce their liquidity problems. For
example, in early 2009, Black & Decker issued about $350 million in 5-year notes
and used the proceeds to pay off some of its commercial paper. Even though the
interest rate on Black & Decker’s 5-year notes was higher than the rates on its
commercial paper, B&D doesn’t have to repay the note until 2014, whereas it
had to refinance the commercial paper each time it came due.
As you read the chapter, think of these companies that suffered or failed
because they mismanaged their capital structure decisions.

As we saw in Chapters 12 and 13, growth in sales requires growth in operating
capital, often requiring that external funds must be raised through a combination
of equity and debt. The firm’s mixture of debt and equity is called its capital
structure. Although actual levels of debt and equity may vary somewhat over
time, most firms try to keep their financing mix close to a target capital struc-
ture. A firm’s capital structure decision includes its choice of a target capital
structure, the average maturity of its debt, and the specific types of financing it
decides to use at any particular time. As with operating decisions, managers
should make capital structure decisions that are designed to maximize the firm’s
intrinsic value.
15.1 A PREVIEW OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE ISSUES
Recall from Chapter 13 that the value of a firm’s operations is the present value of
its expected future free cash flows (FCF) discounted at its weighted average cost of
capital (WACC):
Corporate Valuation and Capital Structure
A firm’s financing choices obviously have a direct effect
on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Fi-
nancing choices also have an indirect effect on the
costs of debt and equity because they change the risk
and required returns of debt and equity. Financing
choices can also affect free cash flows if the probability
of bankruptcy becomes high. This chapter focuses on
the debt–equity choice and its effect on value.

(15-1)
The WACC depends on the percentages of debt and common equity (wd and ws),
the cost of debt (rd), the cost of stock (rs), and the corporate tax rate (T):
WACC = wd(1 −T)rd + wsrs
(15-2)
As these equations show, the only way any decision can change a firm’s value is
by affecting either free cash flows or the cost of capital. We discuss below some of
the ways that a higher proportion of debt can affect WACC and/or FCF.
Debt Increases the Cost of Stock, rs
Debtholders have a claim on the company’s cash flows that is prior to shareholders,
who are entitled only to any residual cash flow after debtholders have been paid.
As we show later in a numerical example, the “fixed” claim of the debtholders causes
the “residual” claim of the stockholders to become riskier, and this increases the cost
of stock, rs.
Debt Reduces the Taxes a Company Pays
Imagine that a company’s cash flows are a pie and that three different groups get
pieces of the pie. The first piece goes to the government in the form of taxes, the
second goes to debtholders, and the third to shareholders. Companies can deduct
interest expenses when calculating taxable income, which reduces the government’s
piece of the pie and leaves more pie available to debtholders and investors. This
reduction in taxes reduces the after-tax cost of debt, as shown in Equation 15-2.
The Risk of Bankruptcy Increases the Cost of Debt, rd
As debt increases, the probability of financial distress, or even bankruptcy, goes up.
With higher bankruptcy risk, debtholders will insist on a higher interest rate, which
increases the pre-tax cost of debt, rd.
The Net Effect on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital
As Equation 15-2 shows, the WACC is a weighted average of relatively low-cost debt
and high-cost equity. If we increase the proportion of debt, then the weight of
low-cost debt (wd) increases and the weight of high-cost equity (ws) decreases. If all
else remained the same, then the WACC would fall and the value of the firm in
Equation 15-1 would increase. But the previous paragraphs show that all else doesn’t
remain the same: both rd and rs increase. It should be clear that changing the capital
structure affects all the variables in the WACC equation, but it’s not easy to say
whether those changes increase the WACC, decrease it, or balance out exactly and
thus leave the WACC unchanged. We’ll return to this issue later when discussing
capital structure theory.
Bankruptcy Risk Reduces Free Cash Flow
As the risk of bankruptcy increases, some customers may choose to buy from another
company, which hurts sales. This, in turn, decreases net operating profit after taxes
(NOPAT), thus reducing FCF. Financial distress also hurts the productivity of
Chapter 15: Capital Structure Decisions
601

workers and managers, who spend more time worrying about their next job than
attending to their current job. Again, this reduces NOPAT and FCF. Finally, suppli-
ers tighten their credit standards, which reduces accounts payable and causes net
operating working capital to increase, thus reducing FCF. Therefore, the risk of
bankruptcy can decrease FCF and reduce the value of the firm.
Bankruptcy Risk Affects Agency Costs
Higher levels of debt may affect the behavior of managers in two opposing ways.
First, when times are good, managers may waste cash flow on perquisites and
unnecessary expenditures. This is an agency cost, as described in Chapter 13. The
good news is that the threat of bankruptcy reduces such wasteful spending, which
increases FCF.
But the bad news is that a manager may become gun-shy and reject positive-NPV
projects if they are risky. From the stockholder’s point of view, it would be unfortu-
nate if a risky project caused the company to go into bankruptcy, but note that other
companies in the stockholder’s portfolio may be taking on risky projects that turn out
to be successful. Since most stockholders are well diversified, they can afford for a
manager to take on risky but positive-NPV projects. But a manager’s reputation and
wealth are generally tied to a single company, so the project may be unacceptably
risky from the manager’s point of view. Thus, high debt can cause managers to forgo
positive-NPV projects unless they are extremely safe. This is called the underinvest-
ment problem, and it is another type of agency cost. Notice that debt can reduce
one aspect of agency costs (wasteful spending) but may increase another (underin-
vestment), so the net effect on value isn’t clear.
Issuing Equity Conveys a Signal to the Marketplace
Managers are in a better position to forecast a company’s free cash flow than are
investors, and academics call this informational asymmetry. Suppose a company’s
stock price is $50 per share. If managers are willing to issue new stock at $50 per
share, investors reason that no one would sell anything for less than its true value.
Therefore, the true value of the shares as seen by the managers with their superior
information must be less than or equal to $50. Thus, investors perceive an equity
issue as a negative signal, and this usually causes the stock price to fall.1
In addition to affecting investors’ perceptions, capital structure choices also affect
FCF and risk, as discussed earlier. The following section focuses on the way that
capital structure affects risk.
A Quick Overview of Actual Debt Ratios
For the average company in the S&P 500, the ratio of long-term debt to equity was
about 92% in the summer of 2009. This means that the typical company had about
$0.92 in debt for every dollar of equity. However, Table 15-1 shows that there are
wide divergences in the average ratios for different business sectors and for different
companies within a sector. For example, the technology sector has a very low average
ratio (23%) while the utilities sector has a much higher ratio (177%). Even so, within
each sector there are some companies with low levels of debt and others with high
1An exception to this rule is any situation with little informational asymmetry, such as a regulated utility.
Also, some companies, such as start-ups or high-tech ventures, are unable to find willing lenders and
therefore must issue equity; we discuss this later in the chapter.

levels. For example, the average debt ratio for the consumer/noncyclical sector is
38%, but in this sector Starbucks has a ratio of 21% while Kellogg has a ratio of
280%. Why do we see such variation across companies and business sectors? Can a
company make itself more valuable through its choice of debt ratio? We address
those questions in the rest of this chapter, beginning with a description of business
risk and financial risk.

WACC and FCF.
15.2 BUSINESS RISK AND FINANCIAL RISK
Business risk and financial risk combine to determine the total risk of a firm’s future
return on equity, as we explained in the next sections.
Business Risk
Business risk is the risk a firm’s common stockholders would face if the firm had no
debt. In other words, it is the risk inherent in the firm’s operations, which arises from
uncertainty about future operating profits and capital requirements.
Business risk depends on a number of factors, beginning with variability in prod-
uct demand. For example, General Motors has more demand variability than does
Kroger: When times are tough, consumers quit buying cars but they still buy food.
Second, most firms are exposed to variability in sales prices and input costs. Some
firms with strong brand identity like Apple may be able to pass unexpected costs
through to their customers, and firms with strong market power like Wal-Mart may
be able to keep their input costs low, but variability in prices and costs adds signifi-
cant risk to most firms’ operations. Third, firms that are slower to bring new

products to market have greater business risk: Think of GM’s relatively sluggish time
to bring a new model to the market versus that of Toyota. Being faster to the market
allows Toyota to more quickly respond to changes in consumer desires. Fourth,
international operations add the risk of currency fluctuations and political risk. Fifth,
if a high percentage of a firm’s costs are fixed and hence do not decline when de-
mand falls, then the firm has high operating leverage, which increases its business
risk. We focus on operating leverage in the next section.
Operating Leverage
A high degree of operating leverage implies that a relatively small change in sales
results in a relatively large change in EBIT, net operating profits after taxes (NOPAT),
and return on invested capital (ROIC). Other things held constant, the higher a firm’s
fixed costs, the greater its operating leverage. Higher fixed costs are generally associ-
ated with (1) highly automated, capital intensive firms; (2) businesses that employ
highly skilled workers who must be retained and paid even when sales are low; and
(3) firms with high product development costs that must be maintained to complete
ongoing R&D projects.
To illustrate the relative impact of fixed versus variable costs, consider Strasburg
Electronics Company, a manufacturer of components used in cell phones. Strasburg
is considering several different operating technologies and several different financing
alternatives. We will analyze its financing choices in the next section, but for now we
focus on its operating plans.
Each of Strasburg’s plans requires a capital investment of $200 million; assume for
now that Strasburg will finance its choice entirely with equity.2 Each plan is expected
to produce 100 million units per year at a sales price of $2 per unit. As shown in
Figure 15-1, Plan A’s technology requires a smaller annual fixed cost than Plan U’s,
but Plan A has higher variable costs. (We denote the second plan with U because it
has no financial leverage, and we denote the third plan with L because it does have
financial leverage; Plan L is discussed in the next section.) Figure 15-1 also shows the
projected income statements and selected performance measures for the first year.
Notice that Plan U has higher net income, higher net operating profit after taxes
(NOPAT), higher return on equity (ROE), and higher return on invested capital
than does Plan A. So at first blush it seems that Strasburg should accept Plan U
instead of Plan A.
Notice that the projections in Figure 15-1 are based on the 110 million units that
are expected to be sold. But what if demand is lower than expected? It often is useful
to know how far sales can fall before operating profits become negative. The
operating break-even point occurs when earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)
equal zero (P, Q, V, and F are defined in Figure 15-1):3
EBIT = PQ −VQ −F = 0
(15-3)
2Strasburg has improved its supply chain operations to such an extent that its operating current assets are
not larger than its operating current liabilities. In fact, its Op CA = Op CL = $10 million. Recall that net
operating working capital (NOWC) is the difference between Op CA and Op CL, so Strasburg has
NOWC = 0. Even though Strasburg’s plans require $210 million in assets, they also generate $10 million
in spontaneous operating liabilities, so Strasburg’s investors must put up only $200 million in some
combination of debt and equity.
3This definition of the break-even point does not include any fixed financial costs because it focuses on
operating profits. We could also examine net income, in which case a levered firm would suffer an
accounting loss even at the operating break-even point. We introduce financial costs shortly.
604
Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

If we solve for the break-even quantity, QBE, we get this expression:
QBE ¼
F
P −V
(15-4)
The break-even quantities for Plans A and U are
Plan A: QBE ¼
$20;000
$2:00 −$1:50 ¼ 40;000 units
Plan U: QBE ¼
$60;000
$2:00 −$1:00 ¼ 60;000 units
Plan A will be profitable if unit sales are above 40,000, whereas Plan U requires
sales of 60,000 units before it is profitable. This difference is because Plan U has
higher fixed costs, so more units must be sold to cover these fixed costs. Panel a of
Figure 15-2 illustrates the operating profitability of these two plans for different
levels of unit sales. (We discuss Panel b in the next section.) Suppose sales are
at 80 million units. In this case, the NOPAT is identical for each plan. As unit
sales begin to climb above 80 million, both plans increase in profitability, but

NOPAT increases more for Plan U than for Plan A. If sales fall below 80 million
then both plans become less profitable, but NOPAT decreases more for Plan U
than for Plan A. This illustrates that the combination of higher fixed costs and
lower variable costs of Plan U magnifies its gain or loss relative to Plan A. In
other words, because Plan U has higher operating leverage, it also has greater
business risk.
Notice that business risk is being driven by variability in the number of units
that can be sold. It would be straightforward to estimate a probability for each
possible level of sales and then calculate the standard deviation of the resulting
NOPATs in exactly the same way that we calculated project risk using scenario
analysis in Chapter 11. This would produce a quantitative estimate of business
risk.4 However, for most purposes it is sufficient to recognize that business risk
increases if operating leverage increases and then use that insight qualitatively
rather than quantitatively when evaluating plans with different degrees of operat-
ing leverage.

4For this example, we could also directly express the standard deviation of NOPAT, σNOPAT, in terms of
the standard deviation of unit sales, σQ: σNOPAT = (P −V)(1 −T) × σQ. We could also express the standard
deviation of ROIC as σROIC = [(P −V)(1 −T)/Capital] × σQ. As this shows, volatility in NOPAT (and
ROIC) is driven by volatility in unit sales, with a bigger spread between price and variable costs leading
to higher volatility. Also, there are several other ways to calculate measures of operating leverage, as we
explain in Web Extension 15A.
606
Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

Financial Risk
Financial risk is the additional risk placed on the common stockholders as a result of
the decision to finance with debt.5 Conceptually, stockholders face a certain amount of
risk that is inherent in a firm’s operations—this is its business risk, which is defined as
the uncertainty in projections of future EBIT, NOPAT, and ROIC. If a firm uses debt
(financial leverage), then the business risk is concentrated on the common stockholders.
To illustrate, suppose ten people decide to form a corporation to manufacture flash
memory drives. There is a certain amount of business risk in the operation. If the firm
is capitalized only with common equity and if each person buys 10% of the stock, then
each investor shares equally in the business risk. However, suppose the firm is capital-
ized with 50% debt and 50% equity, with five of the investors putting up their money
by purchasing debt and the other five putting up their money by purchasing equity. In
this case, the five debtholders are paid before the five stockholders, so virtually all of the
business risk is borne by the stockholders. Thus, the use of debt, or financial leverage,
concentrates business risk on stockholders.6
To illustrate the impact of financial risk, we can extend the Strasburg Electronics
example. Strasburg initially decided to use the technology of Plan U, which is unlev-
ered (financed with all equity), but now it’s considering financing the technology
with $150 million of equity and $50 million of debt at an 8% interest rate, as shown
for Plan L in Figure 15-1 (recall that L denotes leverage). Compare Plans U and L.
Notice that the ROIC of 15% is the same for the two plans because the financing
choice doesn’t affect operations. Plan L has lower net income ($27.6 million versus
$30 million) because it must pay interest, but it has a higher ROE (18.4%) because
the net income is shared over a smaller equity base.7
Suppose Strasburg is a zero-growth company and pays out all net income as
dividends. This means that Plan U has net income of $30 million available for
distribution to its investors. Plan L has $27.6 million net income available to pay
as dividends and it already pays $4 million in interest to its debtholders, so its total
distribution is $27.6 + $4 = $31.6 million. How is it that Plan L is able to distribute
a larger total amount to investors? Look closely at the taxes paid under the two
plans. Plan L pays only $18.4 million in tax while Plan U pays $20 million. The
$1.6 million difference is because interest payments are deductible for tax purposes.
Because Plan L pays less in taxes, an extra $1.6 million is available to distribute to
investors. If our analysis ended here, we would choose Plan L over Plan U because
Plan L distributes more cash to investors and provides a higher ROE for its equity
holders.
But there is more to the story. Just as operating leverage adds risk, so does finan-
cial leverage. We used the Data Table feature in the file Ch15 Tool Kit.xls to gener-
ate performance measures for plans U and L at different levels of unit sales, which
lead to different levels of ROIC. Panel b of Figure 15-2 shows the ROE of Plan L
versus its ROIC. (Keep in mind that the ROIC for Plan U is the same as for Plan L
because leverage doesn’t affect operating performance; also, Plan U’s ROE is the
same as its ROIC because it has no leverage.)
5Preferred stock also adds to financial risk. To simplify matters, we examine only debt and common
equity in this chapter.
6Holders of corporate debt generally do bear some business risk, because they may lose some of their
investment if the firm goes bankrupt. We discuss this in more depth later in the chapter.
7Recall that Strasburg’s operating CA are equal to its operating CL. Strasburg has no short-term
investments, so its book values of debt and equity must sum up to the amount of operating capital it
uses.
Chapter 15: Capital Structure Decisions
607

Notice that for an ROIC of 4.8%, which is the after-tax cost of debt, Plan U
(with no leverage) and Plan L (with leverage) have the same ROE. As ROIC
increases above 6%, the ROE increases for each plan, but more for Plan L than
for Plan U. However, if ROIC falls below 6%, then the ROE falls further for
Plan L than for Plan U. Thus, financial leverage magnifies the ROE for good or
ill, depending on the ROIC, and so increases the risk of a levered firm relative to
an unlevered firm.8
We see, then, that using leverage has both good and bad effects: If expected
ROIC is greater than the after-tax cost of debt, then higher leverage increases
expected ROE but also increases risk.
Strasburg’s Valuation Analysis
Strasburg decided to go with Plan L, the one with high operating leverage and $50
million in debt financing. This resulted in a stock price of $20 per share. With 10
million shares, Strasburg’s market value of equity is $20(10) = $200 million. Strasburg
has no short-term investments, so Strasburg’s total enterprise value is the sum of its
debt and equity: V = $50 + $200 = $250 million. Notice that this is greater than the
required investment, which means that the plan has a positive NPV; another way to
view this is that Strasburg’s Market Value Added (MVA) is positive. In terms of
market values, Strasburg’s capital structure has 20% debt (wd = $50/$250 = 0.20) and
80% equity (ws = $200/$250 = 0.80). These calculations are reported in Figure 15-3.
Is this the optimal capital structure? We will address the question in more detail
later, but for now let’s focus on understanding Strasburg’s current valuation, begin-
ning with its cost of capital. Strasburg has a beta of 1.25. We can use the Capital
Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to estimate the cost of equity. The risk-free rate, rRF,
is 6.3% and the market risk premium, RPM, is 6%, so the cost of equity is
rs = rRF + b(RPM) = 6.3% + 1.25(6%) = 13.8%
The weighted average cost of capital is
WACC ¼ wdð1 −TÞrd þ wsrs
¼ 20%ð1 −0:40Þð8%Þ þ 80%ð13:8%Þ
¼ 12%
As shown in Figure 15-1, Plan L has a NOPAT of $30 million. Strasburg
expects zero growth, which means there are no required investments in capital.
Therefore, FCF is equal to NOPAT. Using the constant growth formula, the value
of operations is
Vop ¼ FCFð1 þ gÞ
WACC −g ¼ $30ð1 þ 0Þ
0:12 −0 ¼ $250
Figure 15-3 illustrates the calculation of the intrinsic stock price. For Strasburg,
the intrinsic stock price and the market price are each equal to $20. Can Strasburg
increase its value by changing its capital structure? The next section discusses how
the trade-off between risk and return affects the value of the firm, and Section 15.5
estimates the optimal capital structure for Strasburg.
8We could also express the standard deviation of ROE, σROE, in terms of the standard deviation
of ROIC: σROE = (Capital/Equity) × σROIC = (Capital/Equity) × [(P −V)(1 −T)/Capital]× σQ. Thus,
volatility in ROE is due to the amount of financial leverage, the amount of operating leverage, and the
underlying risk in units sold. This is similar in spirit to the Du Pont model discussed in Chapter 3.

sells the product for $6 per unit, what is the break-even quantity? (50,000)
15.3 CAPITAL STRUCTURE THEORY
In the previous section, we showed how capital structure choices affect a firm’s ROE
and its risk. For a number of reasons, we would expect capital structures to vary
considerably across industries. For example, pharmaceutical companies generally have
very different capital structures than airline companies. Moreover, capital structures
vary among firms within a given industry. What factors explain these differences? In

an attempt to answer this question, academics and practitioners have developed a num-
ber of theories, and the theories have been subjected to many empirical tests. The
following sections examine several of these theories.9
Modigliani and Miller: No Taxes
Modern capital structure theory began in 1958, when Professors Franco Modigliani
and Merton Miller (hereafter MM) published what has been called the most influen-
tial finance article ever written.10 MM’s study was based on some strong assumptions,
which included the following:
1. There are no brokerage costs.
2. There are no taxes.
3. There are no bankruptcy costs.
4. Investors can borrow at the same rate as corporations.
5. All investors have the same information as management about the firm’s future
investment opportunities.
6. EBIT is not affected by the use of debt.
Modigliani and Miller imagined two hypothetical portfolios. The first contains all the
equity of an unlevered firm, so the portfolio’s value is VU, the value of an unlevered firm.
Because the firm has no growth (which means it does not need to invest in any new net
assets) and because it pays no taxes, the firm can pay out all of its EBIT in the form of
dividends. Therefore, the cash flow from owning this first portfolio is equal to EBIT.
Now consider a second firm that is identical to the unlevered firm except that it is
partially financed with debt. The second portfolio contains all of the levered firm’s stock
(SL) and debt (D), so the portfolio’s value is VL, the total value of the levered firm. If
the interest rate is rd, then the levered firm pays out interest in the amount rdD.
Because the firm is not growing and pays no taxes, it can pay out dividends in the
amount EBIT −rdD. If you owned all of the firm’s debt and equity, your cash flow
would be equal to the sum of the interest and dividends: rdD + (EBIT −rdD) = EBIT.
Therefore, the cash flow from owning this second portfolio is equal to EBIT.
Notice that the cash flow of each portfolio is equal to EBIT. Thus, MM con-
cluded that two portfolios producing the same cash flows must have the same value:11
VL = VU = SL + D

of Investment,” American Economic Review, June 1958, pp. 261–297. Modigliani and Miller each won a
Nobel Prize for their work.
11They actually showed that if the values of the two portfolios differed, then an investor could engage in
riskless arbitrage: The investor could create a trading strategy (buying one portfolio and selling the other)
that had no risk, required none of the investor’s own cash, and resulted in a positive cash flow for the
investor. This would be such a desirable strategy that everyone would try to implement it. But if everyone
tries to buy the same portfolio, its price will be driven up by market demand, and if everyone tries to sell
a portfolio, its price will be driven down. The net result of the trading activity would be to change the
portfolio’s values until they were equal and no more arbitrage was possible.

Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

Given their assumptions, MM proved that a firm’s value is unaffected by its capital
structure.
Recall that the WACC is a combination of the cost of debt and the relatively
higher cost of equity, rs. As leverage increases, more weight is given to low-cost
debt but equity becomes riskier, which drives up rs. Under MM’s assumptions, rs
increases by exactly enough to keep the WACC constant. Put another way: If MM’s
assumptions are correct, then it doesn’t matter how a firm finances its operations and
so capital structure decisions are irrelevant.
Even though some of their assumptions are obviously unrealistic, MM’s irrele-
vance result is extremely important. By indicating the conditions under which capital
structure is irrelevant, MM also provided us with clues about what is required for
capital structure to be relevant and hence to affect a firm’s value. The work of MM
marked the beginning of modern capital structure research, and subsequent research
has focused on relaxing the MM assumptions in order to develop a more realistic
theory of capital structure.
Modigliani and Miller’s thought process was just as important as their conclusion.
It seems simple now, but their idea that two portfolios with identical cash flows must
also have identical values changed the entire financial world because it led to the
development of options and derivatives. It is no surprise that Modigliani and Miller
received Nobel awards for their work.
Modigliani and Miller II: The Effect of Corporate Taxes
In 1963, MM published a follow-up paper in which they relaxed the assumption that
there are no corporate taxes.12 The Tax Code allows corporations to deduct interest
payments as an expense, but dividend payments to stockholders are not deductible.
The differential treatment encourages corporations to use debt in their capital struc-
tures. This means that interest payments reduce the taxes paid by a corporation, and
if a corporation pays less to the government then more of its cash flow is available for
its investors. In other words, the tax deductibility of the interest payments shields the
firm’s pre-tax income.
Yogi Berra on the MM Proposition
When a waitress asked Yogi Berra (Baseball Hall of Fame
catcher for the New York Yankees) whether he wanted
his pizza cut into four pieces or eight, Yogi replied:
“Better make it four. I don’t think I can eat eight.”a
Yogi’s quip helps convey the basic insight of Modigliani
and Miller. The firm’s choice of leverage “slices” the distri-
bution of future cash flows in a way that is like slicing a
pizza. MM recognized that holding a company’s invest-
ment activities fixed is like fixing the size of the pizza; no
information costs means that everyone sees the same
pizza; no taxes means the IRS gets none of the pie; and
no “contracting costs” means nothing sticks to the knife.
So, just as the substance of Yogi’s meal is unaf-
fected by whether the pizza is sliced into four pieces or
eight, the economic substance of the firm is unaffected
by whether the liability side of the balance sheet is
sliced to include more or less debt—at least under the
MM assumptions.

Chapter 15: Capital Structure Decisions
611

As in their earlier paper, MM introduced a second important way of looking at the
effect of capital structure: The value of a levered firm is the value of an otherwise
identical unlevered firm plus the value of any “side effects.” While others have
expanded on this idea by considering other side effects, MM focused on the tax
shield:
VL = VU + Value of side effects = VU + PV of tax shield
(15-6)
Under their assumptions, they showed that the present value of the tax shield is equal
to the corporate tax rate, T, multiplied by the amount of debt, D:
VL = VU + TD
(15-7)
With a tax rate of about 40%, this implies that every dollar of debt adds about 40
cents of value to the firm, and this leads to the conclusion that the optimal capital
structure is virtually 100% debt. MM also showed that the cost of equity, rs,
increases as leverage increases but that it doesn’t increase quite as fast as it would
if there were no taxes. As a result, under MM with corporate taxes the WACC falls
as debt is added.
Miller: The Effect of Corporate and Personal Taxes
Merton Miller (this time without Modigliani) later brought in the effects of
personal taxes.13 The income from bonds is generally interest, which is taxed as
personal income at rates (Td) going up to 35%, while income from stocks generally
comes partly from dividends and partly from capital gains. Long-term capital gains
are taxed at a rate of 15%, and this tax is deferred until the stock is sold and the
gain realized. If stock is held until the owner dies, no capital gains tax whatsoever
must be paid. So, on average, returns on stocks are taxed at lower effective rates
(Ts) than returns on debt.14
Because of the tax situation, Miller argued that investors are willing to accept
relatively low before-tax returns on stock relative to the before-tax returns on bonds.
(The situation here is similar to that with tax-exempt municipal bonds as discussed in
Chapter 5 and preferred stocks held by corporate investors as discussed in Chapter 7.)
For example, an investor might require a return of 10% on Strasburg’s bonds, and if
stock income were taxed at the same rate as bond income, the required rate of return
on Strasburg’s stock might be 16% because of the stock’s greater risk. However, in
view of the favorable treatment of income on the stock, investors might be willing to ac-
cept a before-tax return of only 14% on the stock.
Thus, as Miller pointed out, (1) the deductibility of interest favors the use of debt
financing, but (2) the more favorable tax treatment of income from stock lowers the
required rate of return on stock and thus favors the use of equity financing.
Miller showed that the net impact of corporate and personal taxes is given by this
equation:
13See Merton H. Miller, “Debt and Taxes,” Journal of Finance, May 1977, pp. 261–275.
14The Tax Code isn’t quite as simple as this. An increasing number of investors face the Alternative
Minimum Tax (AMT); see Web Extension 2A for a discussion. The AMT imposes a 28% tax rate on
most income and an effective rate of 22% on long-term capital gains and dividends. Under the AMT
there is still a spread between the tax rates on interest income and stock income, but the spread is nar-
rower. See Leonard Burman, William Gale, Greg Leiserson, and Jeffrey Rohaly, “The AMT: What’s
Wrong and How to Fix It,” National Tax Journal, September 2007, pp. 385–405.

(15-8)
Here Tc is the corporate tax rate, Ts is the personal tax rate on income from stocks,
and Td is the tax rate on income from debt. Miller argued that the marginal tax rates
on stock and debt balance out in such a way that the bracketed term in Equation 15-8
is zero and so VL = VU, but most observers believe there is still a tax advantage to debt
if reasonable values of tax rates are assumed. For example, if the marginal corporate tax
rate is 40%, the marginal rate on debt is 30%, and the marginal rate on stock is 12%,
then the advantage of debt financing is

(15-8a)
Thus it appears that the presence of personal taxes reduces but does not completely
eliminate the advantage of debt financing.
Trade-off Theory
The results of Modigliani and Miller also depend on the assumption that there are
no bankruptcy costs. However, bankruptcy can be quite costly. Firms in bankruptcy
have very high legal and accounting expenses, and they also have a hard time retain-
ing customers, suppliers, and employees. Moreover, bankruptcy often forces a firm to
liquidate or sell assets for less than they would be worth if the firm were to continue
operating. For example, if a steel manufacturer goes out of business it might be hard
to find buyers for the company’s blast furnaces. Such assets are often illiquid because
they are configured to a company’s individual needs and also because they are
difficult to disassemble and move.
Note, too, that the threat of bankruptcy, not just bankruptcy per se, causes many of
these same problems. Key employees jump ship, suppliers refuse to grant credit,
customers seek more stable suppliers, and lenders demand higher interest rates and
impose more restrictive loan covenants if potential bankruptcy looms.
Bankruptcy-related problems are most likely to arise when a firm includes a great
deal of debt in its capital structure. Therefore, bankruptcy costs discourage firms
from pushing their use of debt to excessive levels.
Bankruptcy-related costs have two components: (1) the probability of financial
distress and (2) the costs that would be incurred if financial distress does occur. Firms
whose earnings are more volatile, all else equal, face a greater chance of bankruptcy
and should therefore use less debt than more stable firms. This is consistent with our
earlier point that firms with high operating leverage, and thus greater business risk,
should limit their use of financial leverage. Likewise, firms that would face high costs
in the event of financial distress should rely less heavily on debt. For example, firms
whose assets are illiquid and thus would have to be sold at “fire sale” prices should
limit their use of debt financing.
The preceding arguments led to the development of what is called the trade-off
theory of leverage, in which firms trade off the benefits of debt financing (favorable
corporate tax treatment) against higher interest rates and bankruptcy costs. In
essence, the trade-off theory says that the value of a levered firm is equal to the
Chapter 15: Capital Structure Decisions
613

value of an unlevered firm plus the value of any side effects, which include the tax
shield and the expected costs due to financial distress. A summary of the trade-off
theory is expressed graphically in Figure 15-4, and a list of observations about the
figure follows here.
1. Under the assumptions of the MM model with corporate taxes, a firm’s value
increases linearly for every dollar of debt. The line labeled “MM Result Incor-
porating the Effects of Corporate Taxation” in Figure 15-4 expresses the rela-
tionship between value and debt under those assumptions.
2. There is some threshold level of debt, labeled D1 in Figure 15-4, below which
the probability of bankruptcy is so low as to be immaterial. Beyond D1, however,
expected bankruptcy-related costs become increasingly important, and they
reduce the tax benefits of debt at an increasing rate. In the range from D1 to D2,
expected bankruptcy-related costs reduce but do not completely offset the tax
benefits of debt, so the stock price rises (but at a decreasing rate) as the debt ratio
increases. However, beyond D2, expected bankruptcy-related costs exceed the
tax benefits, so from this point on increasing the debt ratio lowers the value of
the stock. Therefore, D2 is the optimal capital structure. Of course, D1 and D2
vary from firm to firm, depending on their business risks and bankruptcy costs.
3. Although theoretical and empirical work confirm the general shape of the curve
in Figure 15-4, this graph must be taken as an approximation and not as a
precisely defined function.
Signaling Theory
It was assumed by MM that investors have the same information about a firm’s prospects
as its managers—this is called symmetric information. However, managers in fact often
have better information than outside investors. This is called asymmetric information,

and it has an important effect on the optimal capital structure. To see why, consider two
situations, one in which the company’s managers know that its prospects are extremely
positive (Firm P) and one in which the managers know that the future looks negative
(Firm N).
Suppose, for example, that Firm P’s R&D labs have just discovered a nonpatentable
cure for the common cold. They want to keep the new product a secret as long as
possible to delay competitors’ entry into the market. New plants must be built to
make the new product, so capital must be raised. How should Firm P’s management
raise the needed capital? If it sells stock then, when profits from the new product start
flowing in, the price of the stock would rise sharply and the purchasers of the new
stock would make a bonanza. The current stockholders (including the managers) would
also do well, but not as well as they would have done if the company had not sold stock
before the price increased, because then they would not have had to share the benefits
of the new product with the new stockholders. Therefore, we should expect a firm with
very positive prospects to avoid selling stock and instead to raise required new capital by other
means, including debt usage beyond the normal target capital structure.15
Now let’s consider Firm N. Suppose its managers have information that new orders
are off sharply because a competitor has installed new technology that has improved its
products’ quality. Firm N must upgrade its own facilities, at a high cost, just to maintain
its current sales. As a result, its return on investment will fall (but not by as much as if it
took no action, which would lead to a 100% loss through bankruptcy). How should Firm
N raise the needed capital? Here the situation is just the reverse of that facing Firm P,
which did not want to sell stock so as to avoid having to share the benefits of future devel-
opments. A firm with negative prospects would want to sell stock, which would mean bringing
in new investors to share the losses!16 The conclusion from all this is that firms with ex-
tremely bright prospects prefer not to finance through new stock offerings, whereas firms
with poor prospects like to finance with outside equity. How should you, as an investor,
react to this conclusion? You ought to say: “If I see that a company plans to issue new
stock, this should worry me because I know that management would not want to issue
stock if future prospects looked good. However, management would want to issue stock
if things looked bad. Therefore, I should lower my estimate of the firm’s value, other
things held constant, if it plans to issue new stock.”
If you gave this answer then your views are consistent with those of sophisticated
portfolio managers. In a nutshell: The announcement of a stock offering is generally taken
as a signal that the firm’s prospects as seen by its own management are not good; conversely,
a debt offering is taken as a positive signal. Notice that Firm N’s managers cannot make
a false signal to investors by mimicking Firm P and issuing debt. With its unfavorable
future prospects, issuing debt could soon force Firm N into bankruptcy. Given the
resulting damage to the personal wealth and reputations of N’s managers, they can-
not afford to mimic Firm P. All of this suggests that when a firm announces a new
stock offering, more often than not the price of its stock will decline. Empirical stud-
ies have shown that this is indeed true.
Reserve Borrowing Capacity
Because issuing stock sends a negative signal and tends to depress the stock price even if
the company’s true prospects are bright, a company should try to maintain a reserve
15It would be illegal for Firm P’s managers to personally purchase more shares on the basis of their inside
knowledge of the new product.
16Of course, Firm N would have to make certain disclosures when it offered new shares to the public, but
it might be able to meet the legal requirements without fully disclosing management’s worst fears.
Chapter 15: Capital Structure Decisions

borrowing capacity so that debt can be used if an especially good investment opportunity
comes along. This means that firms should, in normal times, use more equity and less debt than
is suggested by the tax benefit–bankruptcy cost trade-off model depicted in Figure 15-4.
The Pecking Order Hypothesis
The presence of flotation costs and asymmetric information may cause a firm to raise
capital according to a pecking order. In this situation, a firm first raises capital inter-
nally by reinvesting its net income and selling its short-term marketable securities.
When that supply of funds has been exhausted, the firm will issue debt and perhaps
preferred stock. Only as a last resort will the firm issue common stock.17
Using Debt Financing to Constrain Managers
Agency problems may arise if managers and shareholders have different objectives.
Such conflicts are particularly likely when the firm’s managers have too much cash
at their disposal. Managers often use excess cash to finance pet projects or for perqui-
sites such as nicer offices, corporate jets, and sky boxes at sports arenas—none of
which have much to do with maximizing stock prices. Even worse, managers might
be tempted to pay too much for an acquisition, something that could cost share-
holders hundreds of millions of dollars. By contrast, managers with limited “excess
cash flow” are less able to make wasteful expenditures.
Firms can reduce excess cash flow in a variety of ways. One way is to funnel some
of it back to shareholders through higher dividends or stock repurchases. Another
alternative is to shift the capital structure toward more debt in the hope that higher
debt service requirements will force managers to be more disciplined. If debt is not
serviced as required then the firm will be forced into bankruptcy, in which case its
managers would likely lose their jobs. Therefore, a manager is less likely to buy an
expensive new corporate jet if the firm has large debt service requirements that could
cost the manager his or her job. In short, high levels of debt bond the cash flow,
since much of it is precommitted to servicing the debt.
A leveraged buyout (LBO) is one way to bond cash flow. In an LBO, a large amount
of debt and a small amount of cash are used to finance the purchase of a company’s shares,
after which the firm “goes private.” The first wave of LBOs was in the mid-1980s; private
equity funds led the buyouts of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Many of these LBOs were
specifically designed to reduce corporate waste. As noted, high debt payments force
managers to conserve cash by eliminating unnecessary expenditures.
Of course, increasing debt and reducing the available cash flow has its downside: It
increases the risk of bankruptcy. Ben Bernanke, current (summer 2009) chairman of
the Fed, has argued that adding debt to a firm’s capital structure is like putting a
dagger into the steering wheel of a car.18 The dagger—which points toward your
stomach—motivates you to drive more carefully, but you may get stabbed if someone
runs into you—even if you are being careful. The analogy applies to corporations in
the following sense: Higher debt forces managers to be more careful with share-
holders’ money, but even well-run firms could face bankruptcy (get stabbed) if some
event beyond their control occurs: a war, an earthquake, a strike, or a recession. To
complete the analogy, the capital structure decision comes down to deciding how
long a dagger stockholders should use to keep managers in line.

Hypothesis,” Financial Management, Spring 1989, pp. 26–35.

Review, September/October 1989, pp. 3–13.

Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

Finally, too much debt may overconstrain managers. A large portion of a man-
ager’s personal wealth and reputation is tied to a single company, so managers are
not well diversified. When faced with a positive-NPV project that is risky, a manager
may decide that it’s not worth taking on the risk even though well-diversified stock-
holders would find the risk acceptable. As previously mentioned, this is an underin-
vestment problem. The more debt the firm has, the greater the likelihood of financial
distress and thus the greater the likelihood that managers will forgo risky projects
even if they have positive NPVs.
The Investment Opportunity Set and Reserve
Borrowing Capacity
Bankruptcy and financial distress are costly, and, as just reiterated, this can discourage
highly levered firms from undertaking risky new investments. If potential new invest-
ments, although risky, have positive net present values, then high levels of debt can be
doubly costly—the expected financial distress and bankruptcy costs are high, and
the firm loses potential value by not making some potentially profitable investments. On
the other hand, if a firm has very few profitable investment opportunities then high levels
of debt can keep managers from wasting money by investing in poor projects. For such
companies, increases in the debt ratio can actually increase the value of the firm.
Thus, in addition to the tax, signaling, bankruptcy, and managerial constraint ef-
fects discussed previously, the firm’s optimal capital structure is related to its set of
investment opportunities. Firms with many profitable opportunities should maintain
their ability to invest by using low levels of debt, which is also consistent with main-
taining reserve borrowing capacity. Firms with few profitable investment opportu-
nities should use high levels of debt (which have high interest payments) to impose
managerial constraint.19
Windows of Opportunity
If markets are efficient, then security prices should reflect all available informa-
tion; hence they are neither underpriced nor overpriced (except during the time
it takes prices to move to a new equilibrium caused by the release of new infor-
mation). The windows of opportunity theory states that managers don’t believe this
and supposes instead that stock prices and interest rates are sometimes either too
low or too high relative to their true fundamental values. In particular, the theory
suggests that managers issue equity when they believe stock market prices are
abnormally high and issue debt when they believe interest rates are abnormally
low. In other words, they try to time the market.20 Notice that this differs from
signaling theory because no asymmetric information is involved: These managers
aren’t basing their beliefs on insider information, just on a difference of opinion
with the market consensus.

15.4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE EVIDENCE AND IMPLICATIONS
There have been hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of papers testing the capital
structure theories described in the previous section. We can cover only the highlights
here, beginning with the empirical evidence.21
Empirical Evidence
Studies show that firms do benefit from the tax deductibility of interest payments,
with a typical firm increasing in value by about $0.10 for every dollar of debt. This
is much less than the corporate tax rate, which supports the Miller model (with
corporate and personal taxes) more than the MM model (with only corporate taxes).
Recent evidence shows that the cost of bankruptcies can be as much as 10% to 20%
of the firm’s value.22 Thus, the evidence shows the existence of tax benefits and
financial distress costs, which provides support for the trade-off theory.
A particularly interesting study by Professors Mehotra, Mikkelson, and Partch ex-
amined the capital structure of firms that were spun off from their parents.23 The
financing choices of existing firms might be influenced by their past financing choices
and by the costs of moving from one capital structure to another, but because spin-
offs are newly created companies, managers can choose a capital structure without
regard to these issues. The study found that more profitable firms (which have a
lower expected probability of bankruptcy) and more asset-intensive firms (which
have better collateral and thus a lower cost of bankruptcy should one occur) have
higher levels of debt. These findings support the trade-off theory.
However, there is also evidence that is inconsistent with the static optimal target
capital structure implied by the trade-off theory. For example, stock prices are
volatile, which frequently causes a firm’s actual market-based debt ratio to deviate
from its target. However, such deviations don’t cause firms to immediately return to
their target by issuing or repurchasing securities. Instead, firms tend to make a partial
adjustment each year, moving about one-third of the way toward their target capital
structure.24 This evidence supports the idea of a more dynamic trade-off theory
in which firms have target capital structures but don’t strive to maintain them
too closely.
If a stock price has a big run-up, which reduces the debt ratio, then the trade-off
theory suggests that the firm should issue debt to return to its target. However, firms
tend to do the opposite, issuing stock after big run-ups. This is much more consistent
with the windows of opportunity theory, with managers trying to time the market by
issuing stock when they perceive the market to be overvalued. Furthermore, firms
tend to issue debt when stock prices and interest rates are low. The maturity of the

short-term debt if the term structure is upward sloping but long-term debt if the

22The expected cost of financial distress is the product of bankruptcy costs and the probability of
bankruptcy. At moderate levels of debt with low probabilities of bankruptcy, the expected cost of financial
distress would be much less than the actual bankruptcy costs if the firm failed.

term structure is flat. Again, these facts suggest that managers try to time the market,
which is consistent with the windows of opportunity theory.
Firms issue equity much less frequently than debt. On the surface, this seems to
support both the pecking order hypothesis and the signaling hypothesis. The pecking
order hypothesis predicts that firms with a high level of informational asymmetry,
which causes equity issuances to be costly, should issue debt before issuing equity.
Yet we often see the opposite, with high-growth firms (which usually have greater
informational asymmetry) issuing more equity than debt. Also, many highly profit-
able firms could afford to issue debt (which comes before equity in the pecking
order) but instead choose to issue equity. With respect to the signaling hypothesis,
consider the case of firms that have large increases in earnings that were unantici-
pated by the market. If managers have superior information, then they will anticipate
these upcoming performance improvements and issue debt before the increase. Such
firms do, in fact, tend to issue debt slightly more frequently than other firms, but the
difference isn’t economically meaningful.
Many firms have less debt than might be expected, and many have large amounts
of short-term investments. This is especially true for firms with high market/book
ratios (which indicate many growth options as well as informational asymmetry).
This behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that investment opportunities influ-
ence attempts to maintain reserve borrowing capacity. It is also consistent with tax
considerations, since low-growth firms (which have more debt) are more likely to
benefit from the tax shield. This behavior is not consistent with the pecking order
hypothesis, where low-growth firms (which often have high free cash flow) would
be able to avoid issuing debt by raising funds internally.
To summarize these results, it appears that firms try to capture debt’s tax benefits
while avoiding financial distress costs. However, they also allow their debt ratios to
deviate from the static optimal target ratio implied by the trade-off theory. There is
a little evidence indicating that firms follow a pecking order and use security issu-
ances as signals, but there is much more evidence in support of the windows of
opportunity theory. Finally, it appears that firms often maintain reserve borrowing
capacity, especially firms with many growth opportunities or problems with informa-
tional asymmetry.25
Implications for Managers
Managers should explicitly consider tax benefits when making capital structure deci-
sions. Tax benefits obviously are more valuable for firms with high tax rates. Firms
can utilize tax loss carryforwards and carrybacks, but the time value of money means
that tax benefits are more valuable for firms with stable, positive pre-tax income.
Therefore, a firm whose sales are relatively stable can safely take on more debt and
incur higher fixed charges than a company with volatile sales. Other things being
equal, a firm with less operating leverage is better able to employ financial leverage
because it will have less business risk and less volatile earnings.
25For more on empirical tests of capital structure theory, see Gregor Andrade and Steven Kaplan, “How
Costly Is Financial (Not Economic) Distress? Evidence from Highly Leveraged Transactions That
Became Distressed,” Journal of Finance, Vol. 53, 1998, pp. 1443–1493; Malcolm Baker, Robin Greenwood,
and Jeffrey Wurgler, “The Maturity of Debt Issues and Predictable Variation in Bond Returns,” Journal
of Financial Economics, November 2003, pp. 261–291; Murray Z. Frank and Vidhan K. Goyal, “Testing
the Pecking Order Theory of Capital Structure,” Journal of Financial Economics, February 2003, pp. 217–

Midland Corporate Finance Journal, Fall 1985, pp. 53–59.
Chapter 15: Capital Structure Decisions

Managers should also consider the expected cost of financial distress, which de-
pends on the probability and cost of distress. Notice that stable sales and lower oper-
ating leverage provide tax benefits but also reduce the probability of financial distress.
One cost of financial distress comes from lost investment opportunities. Firms with
profitable investment opportunities need to be able to fund them, either by holding
higher levels of marketable securities or by maintaining excess borrowing capacity.
An astute corporate treasurer made this statement to the authors:
Our company can earn a lot more money from good capital budgeting and operating deci-
sions than from good financing decisions. Indeed, we are not sure exactly how financing
decisions affect our stock price, but we know for sure that having to turn down a promising
venture because funds are not available will reduce our long-run profitability.
Another cost of financial distress is the possibility of being forced to sell assets to
meet liquidity needs. General-purpose assets that can be used by many businesses are
relatively liquid and make good collateral, in contrast to special-purpose assets. Thus,
real estate companies are usually highly leveraged whereas companies involved in
technological research are not.
Asymmetric information also has a bearing on capital structure decisions. For ex-
ample, suppose a firm has just successfully completed an R&D program, and it fore-
casts higher earnings in the immediate future. However, the new earnings are not yet
anticipated by investors and hence are not reflected in the stock price. This company
should not issue stock—it should finance with debt until the higher earnings materi-
alize and are reflected in the stock price. Then it could issue common stock, retire
the debt, and return to its target capital structure.
Managers should consider conditions in the stock and bond markets. For example, dur-
ing a recent credit crunch, the junk bond market dried up and there was simply no market
at a “reasonable” interest rate for any new long-term bonds rated below BBB. Therefore,
low-rated companies in need of capital were forced to go to the stock market or to the
short-term debt market, regardless of their target capital structures. When conditions
eased, however, these companies sold bonds to get their capital structures back on target.
Taking a Look at Global Capital Structures
To what extent does capital structure vary across differ-
ent countries? The accompanying table, which is taken
from a study by Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales,
gives the median debt ratios of firms in the largest in-
dustrial countries.
Rajan and Zingales show that there is considerable
variation
in
capital
structure
among
firms
within
each of the seven countries. However, they also
show that capital structures for the firms in each
country are generally determined by a similar set of
factors: firm size, profitability, market-to-book ratio,
and the ratio of fixed assets to total assets. All in all,
the Rajan–Zingales study suggests that the points
developed in the chapter apply to firms around the
world.

Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

Finally, managers should always consider lenders’ and rating agencies’ attitudes.
For example, one large utility was recently told by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s
that its bonds would be downgraded if it issued more debt. This influenced the uti-
lity’s decision to finance its expansion with common equity. This doesn’t mean that
managers should never increase debt if it will cause their bond rating to fall, but
managers should always factor this into their decision making.26
Self-Test
Which capital structure theories does the empirical evidence seem to support?
What issues should managers consider when making capital structure decisions?
15.5 ESTIMATING THE OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE
Managers should choose the capital structure that maximizes shareholders’ wealth.
The basic approach is to consider a trial capital structure, based on the market values
of the debt and equity, and then estimate the wealth of the shareholders under this
capital structure. This approach is repeated until an optimal capital structure is iden-
tified. There are several steps in the analysis of each potential capital structure: (1)
Estimate the interest rate the firm will pay. (2) Estimate the cost of equity. (3) Esti-
mate the weighted average cost of capital. (4) Estimate the value of operations, which
is the present value of free cash flows discounted by the new WACC. The objective
is to find the amount of debt financing that maximizes the value of operations. As we
will show, this is also the capital structure that maximizes shareholder wealth and the
intrinsic stock price. The following sections explain each of these steps, using the
company we considered earlier, Strasburg Electronics.
Estimating the Cost of Debt, rd
Recall that Strasburg chose Plan L, with high operating leverage and a capital structure
consisting of 20% debt. The CFO asked Strasburg’s investment bankers to estimate
the cost of debt at different capital structures. The investment bankers began by ana-
lyzing industry conditions and prospects. They appraised Strasburg’s business risk
based on its past financial statements and its current technology and customer base.
The bankers also forecasted financial statements with different capital structures
and analyzed such key ratios as the current ratio and the times-interest-earned ratio.
Finally, they factored in current conditions in the financial markets, including interest
rates paid by firms in Strasburg’s industry. Based on their analysis and judgment, they
estimated interest rates at various capital structures as shown in Row 2 of Figure 15-5,
starting with a 7.7% cost of debt for the first dollar of debt. This rate increases to 16%
if the firm finances 60% of its capital structure with debt. Strasburg’s current situation
is in Column D and is shown in blue. (We will explain all the rows in Figure 15-5 in
the following discussion.)
Estimating the Cost of Equity, rs
An increase in the debt ratio also increases the risk faced by shareholders, and this
has an effect on the cost of equity, rs. Recall from Chapter 6 that a stock’s beta is
the relevant measure of risk for diversified investors. Moreover, it has been
26For some insights into how practicing financial managers view the capital structure decision, see John
Graham and Campbell Harvey, “The Theory and Practice of Corporate Finance: Evidence from the
Field,” Journal of Financial Economics, Vol. 60, 2001, pp. 187–243; Ravindra R. Kamath, “Long-Term Fi-
nancing Decisions: Views and Practices of Financial Managers of NYSE Firms,” Financial Review, May
1997, pp. 331–356; and Edgar Norton, “Factors Affecting Capital Structure Decisions,” Financial Review,
August 1991, pp. 431–446.

demonstrated, both theoretically and empirically, that beta increases with financial le-
verage. The Hamada equation specifies the effect of financial leverage on beta:27
b = bU[1 + (1 −T)(D/S)]
(15-9)
Here D is the market value of the debt and S is the market value of the equity. The
Hamada equation shows how increases in the market value debt/equity ratio increase
beta. Here bU is the firm’s unlevered beta coefficient—that is, the beta it would
have if it had no debt. In that case, beta would depend entirely on business risk and
thus be a measure of the firm’s “basic business risk.”

Percent of Firm Financed with Debt (wd)
Notes:
1. The percent financed with equity is: ws = 1 −wd.
2. The interest rate on debt, rd, is obtained from investment bankers.
3. Beta is estimated using Hamada’s formula, the unlevered beta of 1.09, and a tax rate of 40%: b = bUx[1 + (1 −T)x(wd/ws)].
4. The cost of equity is estimated using the CAPM formula with a risk-free rate of 6.3% and a market risk premium of 6%:
rs = rRF + (RPM)b.
5. The after-tax cost of debt is: rd(1 −T), where T = 40%.
6. The weighted average cost of capital is calculated as WACC = wsrs + wdrd(1 −T).
7. The value of the firm’s operations is calculated as Vop = [FCF(1 + g)]/(WACC −g), where FCF = $30 million and g = 0.
8. Debt = wd × Vop.
9. The intrinsic value of equity after the recapitalization and repurchase is SPost = ws × Vop.
10. The number of shares after the recap has been completed is found using this equation: nPost = nPrior × [(VopNew −DNew)/
(VopNew −DOld). The subscript “Old” indicates values from the original capital structure, where wd = 20%; the subscript
“New” indicates values at the current capital structure after the recap and repurchase; and the subscript “Post” indi-
cates values after the recap and repurchase.
11. The price after the recap and repurchase is PPost = SPost/nPost, but we can also find the price as PPost = (VopNew −DOld)/nPrior.
12. EBIT is $50 million; see Figure 15-1. Net income is NI = (EBIT −rdD)(1 −T).
13. Earnings per share is EPS = NI/nPost.

Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

Sometimes it is more convenient to work with the percentages of debt and equity
at which the firm is financed (wd and ws) rather than the dollar values of D and S.
Notice that wd and ws are defined as D/(D + S) and S/(D + S), respectively. This
means that the ratio wd/ws is equal to the ratio D/S. Substituting these values gives
us another form of Hamada’s formula:
b = bU[1 + (1 −T)(wd/ws)]
(15-9a)
Often we know the current capital structure and beta but wish to know the unlev-
ered beta. We find this by rearranging Equation 15-9a as follows:
bU = b/[1 + (1 −T)( wd/ws)]
(15-10)
For Strasburg, the unlevered beta is
bU ¼ 1:25=½1 þ ð1  0:40Þð0:20=0:80Þ
¼ 1:087
Using this unlevered beta, we can then apply Hamada’s formula in Equation 15-9a to
determine estimates of Strasburg’s beta for different capital structures. These results
are reported in Line 3 of Figure 15-5.
Recall from Section 15.2 that the risk-free rate is 6.3% and the market risk premium is
6%. We can use the CAPM and the previously estimated betas to estimate Strasburg’s
cost of equity for different capital structures (which cause Strasburg’s beta to change).
These results are shown in Line 4 of Figure 15-5. As expected, Strasburg’s cost of equity
increases as its debt increases. Figure 15-6 graphs Strasburg’s required return on equity at
different debt ratios. Observe that the cost of equity consists of the 6.3% risk-free rate, a

constant premium for business risk in the amount of RPM(bU) = 6.522%, and a premium
for financial risk in the amount of RPM(b −bU) that starts at zero (because b = bU for zero
debt) but rises at an increasing rate as the debt ratio increases.
Estimating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital, WACC
Line 6 of Figure 15-5 shows Strasburg’s weighted average cost of capital, WACC, at
different capital structures. As the debt ratio increases, the costs of both debt and equity
rise, at first slowly but then at an accelerating rate. Eventually, the increasing costs of
these two components offset the fact that more debt (which is still less costly than equity)
is being used. At 40% debt, Strasburg’s WACC hits a minimum of 11.63%; Column F is
shown in red to indicate that it is the capital structure with the minimum WACC.
Notice that the WACC begins to increase for capital structures with more than 40%
debt. Figure 15-7 shows how the WACC changes as debt increases.
Note too that, even though the component cost of equity is always higher than
that of debt, only using debt would not maximize value. If Strasburg were to issue
more than 40% debt, then the costs of both debt and equity would increase in such
a way that the overall WACC would increase, because the cost of debt would in-
crease by more than the cost of equity.
Estimating the Firm’s Value
As we showed in Section 15.2, Strasburg currently has a $250 million intrinsic value of
operations: wd = 20%, WACC = 12%, FCF = $30 million, and zero growth in FCF.
Using the same approach as in Section 15.2 we can use the data in Figure 15-5 to
estimate Strasburg’s value of operations at different capital structures; these results
are reported in Line 7 of Figure 15-5 and are graphed in Figure 15-8.28 The maxi-
mum value of $257.86 million occurs at a capital structure with 40% debt, which
also is the capital structure that minimizes the WACC.

28In this analysis we assume that Strasburg’s expected EBIT and FCF are constant for the various capital
structures. In a more refined analysis we might try to estimate any possible declines in FCF at high levels
of debt as the threat of bankruptcy becomes imminent.
624
Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

Notice that the value of the firm initially increases but then begins to fall. As discussed
earlier, the value initially rises because the WACC initially falls. But the rising costs of
equity and debt eventually cause the WACC to increase, causing the value of the firm
to fall. Notice how flat the curve is around the optimal level of debt. Thus, it doesn’t
make a great deal of difference whether Strasburg’s capital structure has 30% debt or
40% debt. Also, notice that the maximum value is about 10% greater than the value
with no debt. Although this example is for a single company, the results are typical: The
optimal capital structure can add 7% to 15% more value relative to zero debt, and there is
a fairly wide range of wd (from about 20% to 50%) over which value changes very little.
Figures 15-5 and 15-8 also show the values of debt and equity for each capital
structure. The value of debt is found by multiplying the value of operations by the
percentage of the firm that is financed by debt: Debt = wd × Vop. The intrinsic value
of equity is found in a similar manner: S = ws × Vop. Even though the intrinsic value
of equity falls as debt increases, the wealth of shareholders is maximized at the maxi-
mum value of operations, as we explain in the next section.
Self-Test
What happens to the costs of debt and equity when the leverage increases? Explain.
Use the Hamada equation to calculate the unlevered beta for JAB Industries,
assuming the following data: Levered beta = b = 1.4; T = 40%; wd = 45%. (0.939)
Suppose rRF = 6% and RPM = 5%. What would be the cost of equity for JAB
Industries if it had no debt? (10.7%) If wd were 45%? (13.0%)
15.6 ANATOMY OF A RECAPITALIZATION
Strasburg should recapitalize, meaning that it should issue enough additional debt to
optimize its capital structure, and then use the debt proceeds to repurchase stock. As
shown in Figure 15-5, a capital structure with 40% debt is optimal. But before

tackling the recap, as it is commonly called, let’s consider the sequence of events,
starting with the situation before Strasburg issues any additional debt. Figure 15-3
shows the valuation analysis of Strasburg at a capital structure consisting of 20%
debt and 80% equity. These results are repeated in Column 1 of Figure 15-9,
along with the shareholder wealth, which consists entirely of $200 million in
stock before the repurchase. The next step is to examine the impact of Stras-
burg’s debt issuance.
Strasburg Issues New Debt but Has Not Yet
Repurchased Stock
The next step in the recap is to issue debt and announce the firm’s intent to repurchase
stock with the newly issued debt. At the optimal capital structure of 40% debt, the
value of the firm’s operations is $257.86 million, as calculated in Figure 15-5 and
repeated in Column 2 of Figure 15-9. This value of operations is greater than the
$250 million value of operations for wd = 20% because the WACC is lower. Notice
that Strasburg raised its debt from $50 million to $103.14 million, an increase of
$53.14 million. Because Column 2 reports data prior to the repurchase, Strasburg has
short-term investments in the amount of $53.14 million, the amount that was raised in
the debt issuance but that has not yet been used to repurchase stock.29 As Figure 15-9
shows, Strasburg’s intrinsic value of equity is $207.86 million.

Notes:
1. The value of ST investments in Column 2 is equal to the amount of cash raised by issuing additional debt but that has
not been used to repurchase shares: ST investments = DNew −DOld.
2. The value of ST investments in Column 3 is zero because the funds have been used to repurchase shares of stock.
3. The number of shares in Column 3 reflects the shares repurchased: nPost = nPrior −(CashRep/PPrior) = nPrior −
[(DNew −DOld)/PPrior].
29These calculations are shown in the Excel file Ch15 Tool Kit.xls on the textbook’s Web site. The values
reported in the text are rounded, but the values used in calculations in the spreadsheet are not rounded.
626
Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

Because Strasburg has not yet repurchased any stock, it still has 10 million shares out-
standing. Therefore, the price per share after the debt issue but prior to the repurchase is
PPrior ¼ SPrior=nPrior
¼ $207:86=10 ¼ $20:79
Column 2 of Figure 15-9 summarizes these calculations and also shows the wealth
of the shareholders. The shareholders own Strasburg’s equity, which is worth
$207.86 million. Strasburg has not yet made any cash distributions to shareholders,
so the total wealth of shareholders is $207.86 million. The new wealth of $207.86
million is greater than the initial wealth of $200 million, so the recapitalization has
added value to Strasburg’s shareholders. Notice also that the recapitalization caused
the intrinsic stock price to increase from $20.00 to $20.79.
Summarizing these results, we see that the issuance of debt and the resulting change
in the optimal capital structure caused (1) the WACC to decrease, (2) the value of opera-
tions to increase, (3) shareholder wealth to increase, and (4) the stock price to increase.
Strasburg Repurchases Stock
What happens to the stock price during the repurchase? Recall from Chapter 14 that
a repurchase does not change the stock price. It is true that the additional debt will
change the WACC and the stock price prior to the repurchase (PPrior), but the sub-
sequent repurchase itself will not affect the post-repurchase stock price (PPost).30
Therefore, PPost = PPrior. (Keep in mind that PPrior is the price immediately prior to
the repurchase, not the price prior to the event that led to the cash available for the
repurchase, such as the issuance of debt in this example.)
Strasburg uses the entire amount of cash raised by the debt issue to repurchase
stock. The total cash raised is equal to DNew −DOld. The number of shares repurch-
ased is equal to the cash raised by issuing debt divided by the repurchase price:
Number of shares repurchased ¼ DNew −DOld
PPrior
(15-11)
Strasburg repurchases ($103.14 −$50)/$20.79 = 2.56 million shares of stock.
The number of remaining shares after the repurchase, nPost, is equal to the initial
number of shares minus the number that is repurchased:
nPost ¼ Number of outstanding shares remaining after the repurchase
¼ nPrior −Number of shares repurchased
¼ nPrior −DNew −DOld
PPrior
(15-12)
For Strasburg, the number of remaining shares after the repurchase is
nPost ¼ nPrior −ðDNew −DOldÞ=PPrior
¼ 10 −ð$103:14 −$50Þ=$20:79
¼ 7:44 million
30As we discussed in Chapter 14, a stock repurchase may be a signal of a company’s future prospects or it
may be the way a company “announces” a change in capital structure, and either of these situations could
have an impact on estimated free cash flows or WACC. However, neither situation applies to Strasburg.
Chapter 15: Capital Structure Decisions
627

Column 3 of Figure 15-9 summarizes these post-repurchase results. The repur-
chase doesn’t change the value of operations, which remains at $257.86 million.
However, the short-term investments are sold and the cash is used to repurchase
stock. Strasburg is left with no short-term investments, so the intrinsic value of
equity is:
SPost = $257.86 −$103.14 = $154.72 million
After the repurchase, Strasburg has 7.44 million shares of stock. We can verify that
the intrinsic stock price has not changed:31
PPost = SPost/nPost = $154.72/7.44 = $20.79
Shareholders now own an equity position in the company worth only $154.72 mil-
lion, but they have received a cash distribution in the amount of $53.14 million, so
their total wealth is equal to the value of their equity plus the amount of cash they
received: $154.72 + $53.14 = $207.86.
Here are some points worth noting. As shown in Column 3 of Figure 15-9, the
change in capital structure clearly added wealth to the shareholders, increased the
price per share, and increased the cash (in the form of short-term investments) tem-
porarily held by the company. However, the repurchase itself did not affect share-
holder wealth or the price per share. The repurchase did reduce the cash held by
the company and the number of shares outstanding, but shareholder wealth stayed
constant. After the repurchase, shareholders directly own the funds used in the re-
purchase; before the repurchase, shareholders indirectly own the funds. In either
case, shareholders own the funds. The repurchase simply takes them out of the com-
pany’s account and puts them into the shareholders’ personal accounts.
The approach we’ve described here is based on the corporate valuation model, and
it will always provide the correct value for SPost, and nPost, and PPost. However, there
is a quicker way to calculate these values if the firm has no short-term investments
either before or after the recap (other than the temporary short-term investments
held between the time debt was issued and shares repurchased). After the recap is
completed, the percentage of equity in the capital structure, based on market values,
is equal to 1 −wd if the firm holds no other short-term investments. Therefore, the
value of equity after the repurchase is
SPost = VopNew(1 −wd)
(15-13)
where we use the subscript “New” to indicate the value of operations at the new cap-
ital structure and the subscript “Post” to indicate the post-repurchase intrinsic value
of equity.
The post-repurchase number of shares can found using this equation:
nPost ¼ nPrior
VopNew −DNew
VopNew −DOld


(15-14)
Given the value of equity and the number of shares, it is straightforward to calcu-
late the intrinsic price per share as PPost = SPost/nPost. But we can also calculate the
post-repurchase price using
31There may be a small rounding difference due to using rounded numbers in intermediate steps. See the
Excel file Ch15 Tool Kit.xls for the exact calculations.

PPost ¼ VopNew −DOld

(15-15)
Figure 15-5 reports the number of shares and the intrinsic price per share in
Lines 9–10. Notice that the number of shares goes down as debt goes up because
the debt proceeds are used to buy back stock. Notice also that the capital structure
that maximizes stock price, wd = 40%, is the same capital structure that optimizes
the WACC and the value of operations.
Figure 15-5 also reports the earnings per share for the different levels of debt.
Figure 15-10 graphs the intrinsic price per share and the earnings per share. Notice
that the maximum earnings per share is at 50% debt even though the optimal capital
structure is at 40% debt. This means that maximizing EPS will not maximize share-
holder wealth.
Recapitalizations: A Post-Mortem
In Chapter 13, we looked at value-based management and saw how companies can
increase their value by improving their operations. Yet there is good news and bad
news regarding this connection. The good news is that small improvements in opera-
tions can lead to huge increases in value. The bad news is that it’s often difficult to
improve operations, especially if the company is already well managed and is in a
competitive industry.
If instead you seek to increase a firm’s value by changing its capital structure, we
again have good news and bad news. The good news is that changing capital struc-
ture is easy—just call an investment banker and issue debt (or issue equity if the firm
has too much debt). The bad news is that this will add only a relatively small amount
of value. Of course, any additional value is better than none, so it’s hard to under-
stand why there are some mature firms with zero debt.

Finally, some firms have more debt than is optimal and should recapitalize to a lower
debt level. This is called deleveraging. We can use exactly the same approach and the same
formulas as we used for Strasburg. The difference is that the debt will go down and the
number of shares will go up. In other words, the company will issue new shares of stock
and then use the proceeds to pay off debt, resulting in a capital structure with less debt
and lower interest payments.
Self-Test
A firm’s value of operations is equal to $800 million after a recapitalization (the firm
had no debt before the recap). The firm raised $200 million in new debt and used
this to buy back stock. The firm had no short-term investments before or after the
recap. After the recap, wd = 25%. The firm had 10 million shares before the recap.
What is S (the value of equity after the recap)? ($600 million) What is P (the stock
price after the recap)? ($80/share) What is n (the number of remaining shares after
the recap)? (7.5 million)
Summary
This chapter examined the effects of financial leverage on stock prices, earnings per
share, and the cost of capital. The key concepts covered are listed below.
•
A firm’s optimal capital structure is the mix of debt and equity that maximizes
the stock price. At any point in time, management has a specific target capital
structure in mind, presumably the optimal one, although this target may change
over time.
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
Deleveraging
Many households, nonfinancial businesses, and financial
institutions loaded up on easy credit during the run-up to
the global economic crisis and found themselves with too
much debt during the recession that began in 2007. The
process of reducing debt is called deleveraging, and it is
painful for individuals and the economy.
The debt-to-income ratio for households increased
from around 80%–90% during the 1990s to a peak of
133% in 2007. To deleverage, many households are cut-
ting spending on consumer goods and paying off some
of their debt. This belt-tightening is difficult for the indi-
vidual households, but it also is difficult for the econ-
omy because decreased spending leads to economic
contraction and job losses. Other households are de-
leveraging by declaring bankruptcy, with over 1.4 mil-
lion people filing in 2008 and even more expected to
file by the end of 2009.
Like individuals, business can deleverage by paying
off debt or by declaring bankruptcy, and many are doing
so during this global economic crisis. But businesses
can also deleverage by issuing equity. For example,
Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley issued over $12 billion
in stock in May of 2009; nonfinancial companies either
issuing equity or planning to do so include Vulcan Mate-
rials and Callaway Golf, with the proceeds being used to
reduce debt. A problem with deleveraging via stock is-
suances is that the stock price usually has been beaten
down so much by the time of deleveraging that the new
investors get a larger stake in the company, which
dilutes the existing stockholders. But the bottom line is
that dilution is better than bankruptcy!

Part 6: Cash Distributions and Capital Structure

•
Several factors influence a firm’s capital structure. These include its (1) business
risk, (2) tax position, (3) need for financial flexibility, (4) managerial conserv-
atism or aggressiveness, and (5) growth opportunities.
•
Business risk is the risk inherent in the firm’s operations if it uses no debt. A
firm will have little business risk if the demand for its products is stable, if the
prices of its inputs and products remain relatively constant, if it can adjust its
prices freely if costs increase, and if a high percentage of its costs are variable and
hence will decrease if sales decrease. Other things the same, the lower a firm’s
business risk, the higher its optimal debt ratio.
•
Financial leverage is the extent to which fixed-income securities (debt and pre-
ferred stock) are used in a firm’s capital structure. Financial risk is the added
risk borne by stockholders as a result of financial leverage.
•
Operating leverage is the extent to which fixed costs are used in a firm’s
operations. In business terminology, a high degree of operating leverage, other
factors held constant, implies that a relatively small change in sales results in a
large change in ROIC. Web Extension 15A describes additional measures of
operating and financial leverage.
•
Modigliani and Miller showed that if there are no taxes, then the value of a le-
vered firm is equal to the value of an otherwise identical but unlevered firm:
VL = VU
•
If there are only corporate taxes, Modigliani and Miller showed that a firm’s
value increases as it adds debt due to the interest rate deductibility of debt:
VL = VU + TD
•
If there are personal and corporate taxes, Miller showed that
VL ¼ VU þ 1−ð1 −TcÞð1 −TsÞ
ð1 −TdÞ


D
•
The Hamada equation shows the effect of financial leverage on beta as follows:
b = bU[1 + (1 −T)(D/S)]
Firms can use their current beta, tax rate, and debt/equity ratio to derive their
unlevered beta, bU, as follows:
bU = b/[1 + (1 −T)(D/S)] = b/[1 + (1 −T)(wd/ws)]
•
The trade-off theory of capital structure states that debt initially adds value
because interest is tax deductible but that debt also brings costs associated with
actual or potential bankruptcy. The optimal capital structure strikes a balance
between the tax benefits of debt and the costs associated with bankruptcy.
•
A firm’s decision to use debt versus stock to raise new capital sends a signal to
investors. A stock issue is viewed as a negative signal, whereas a debt issuance is a
positive (or at least a neutral) signal. As a result, companies try to avoid having to
issue stock by maintaining a reserve borrowing capacity, and this means using
less debt in “normal” times than the trade-off theory would suggest.
•
A firm’s owners may decide to use a relatively large amount of debt to constrain
the managers. A high debt ratio raises the threat of bankruptcy, which not
only carries a cost but also forces managers to be more careful and less wasteful
with shareholders’ money. Many of the corporate takeovers and leveraged buy-
outs in recent years were designed to improve efficiency by reducing the cash
flow available to managers.

Break-even Point
Schweser Satellites Inc. produces satellite earth stations that sell for $100,000 each.
The firm’s fixed costs, F, are $2 million, 50 earth stations are produced and sold
each year, profits total $500,000, and the firm’s assets (all equity financed) are $5 mil-
lion. The firm estimates that it can change its production process, adding $4 million
to investment and $500,000 to fixed operating costs. This change will (1) reduce var-
iable costs per unit by $10,000 and (2) increase output by 20 units, but (3) the sales
price on all units will have to be lowered to $95,000 to permit sales of the additional
output. The firm has tax loss carryforwards that render its tax rate zero, its cost of
equity is 16%, and it uses no debt.
a. What is the incremental profit? To get a rough idea of the project’s profitability,
what is the project’s expected rate of return for the next year (defined as the in-
cremental profit divided by the investment)? Should the firm make the

cost of equity, rs, will increase to 11% to reflect the increased risk. Bonds can be
sold at a cost, rd, of 7%. Rivoli is a no-growth firm. Hence, all its earnings are paid
out as dividends. Earnings are expected to be constant over time.

Capital Structure
Analysis
Pettit Printing Company has a total market value of $100 million, consisting of
1 million shares selling for $50 per share and $50 million of 10% perpetual bonds
now selling at par. The company’s EBIT is $13.24 million, and its tax rate is 15%.
Pettit can change its capital structure either by increasing its debt to 70% (based on
market values) or decreasing it to 30%. If it decides to increase its use of leverage, it
must call its old bonds and issue new ones with a 12% coupon. If it decides to decrease
its leverage, it will call its old bonds and replace them with new 8% coupon bonds.
The company will sell or repurchase stock at the new equilibrium price to complete
the capital structure change.
The firm pays out all earnings as dividends; hence its stock is a zero-growth stock.
Its current cost of equity, rs, is 14%. If it increases leverage, rs will be 16%. If it de-
creases leverage, rs will be 13%. What is the firm’s WACC and total corporate value
under each capital structure?

Elliott Athletics is trying to determine its optimal capital structure, which now consists of
only debt and common equity. The firm does not currently use preferred stock in its
capital structure, and it does not plan to do so in the future. To estimate how much its
debt would cost at different debt levels, the company’s treasury staff has consulted with
investment bankers and, on the basis of those discussions, has created the following table:

EXPLORING THE CAPITAL STRUCTURES FOR THREE GLOBAL
AUTO COMPANIES
The following discussion questions demonstrate how we can evaluate the capital
structures for three global automobile companies: Ford (F), BMW (BMW), and
Toyota (J:TYMO). As you gather information on these companies, be mindful of
the currencies in which these companies’ financial data are reported.
Thomson ONE—BSE Discussion Questions
1. To get an overall picture of each company’s capital structure, it is helpful to see a
chart that summarizes the company’s capital structure over the past decade.
To obtain this chart, choose a company to start with and select FINANCIALS.
Next, select MORE>THOMSON REPORTS & CHARTS>CAPITAL STRUC-
TURE. This should generate a chart that plots the company’s long-term debt,
common equity, and total current liabilities over the past decade. What, if any,
are the major trends that emerge from looking at these charts? Do these companies
tend to have relatively high or relatively low levels of debt? Do these companies
have significant levels of current liabilities? Have their capital structures changed
over time? (Note that an alternative chart can be found by selecting FINAN-
CIALS>FUNDAMENTAL RATIOS>WORLDSCOPE RATIOS>DEBT TO
ASSETS & EQUITY RATIOS.)
2. To obtain more details about the companies’ capital structures over the past five
years, select FINANCIALS>FUNDAMENTAL RATIOS>THOMSON RA-
TIOS. From here you can select ANNUAL RATIOS and/or 5 YEAR AVER-
AGE RATIOS REPORT. In each case, you can scroll down and look for
Leverage Ratios. Here you will find a variety of leverage ratios for the past 5
years. (Notice that these two pages offer different information. The ANNUAL
RATIOS page offers year-end leverage ratios, whereas the 5 YEAR AVERAGE
RATIOS REPORT offers the average ratio over the previous 5 years for each
calendar date. In other words, the 5 YEAR AVERAGE RATIOS REPORT
smoothes the changes in capital structure over the reporting period.) Do these
ratios suggest that the company has significantly changed its capital structure
over the past 5 years? If so, what factors could possibly explain this shift? (Finan-
cial statements might be useful for detecting any shifts that may have led to the
company’s changing capital structure. You may also consult the company’s annual
report to see if there is any discussion and/or explanation for these changes. Both
the historical financial statements and annual report information can be found via
Thomson ONE).
3. Repeat this procedure for the other auto companies. Do you find similar capital
structures for each of the four companies? Do you find that the capital structures
have moved in the same direction over the past 5 years, or have the different compa-
nies changed their capital structures in different ways over the past 5 years?
4. The financial ratios investigated thus far are based on book values of debt and equity.
Determine whether using the market value of equity (market capitalization found on
the OVERVIEW page) makes a significant difference in the most recent year’s “LT

while “Total Debt” is defined as “Long Term Debt” plus “ST Debt & Current
Portion Due LT Debt.”) Are there big differences between the capital structures
measured on a book or market basis?
5. You can also use Thomson ONE to search for companies with either very large
or very small debt ratios. For example, if you want to find the top 50 companies
with the highest debt ratio, select: SEARCH FOR COMPANIES>ADVANCED
SEARCH>ALL COMPANIES>THOMSON FINANCIAL>RATIOS>LEVER-
AGE. From here, select “LT Debt Pct Total Cap 5 Yr. Avg.” (This will focus in
on the average capital structure over the past 5 years, which may give us a better
indication of the company’s long-run target capital structure.) Once you click on
SELECT, you should see the Search Expression Builder screen. From here, you
go to Rank and select the top 50 by typing “50” in the box below rank and then
clicking on ADD. You can easily change this to also select the bottom 50 (or per-
haps the bottom 5% or 10%). Take a close look at the resulting firms by clicking
on SEARCH. Do you observe any differences between the types of firms that
have high debt levels and the types of firms that have low debt levels? Are these
patterns similar to what you expect after reading the chapter? (As a quick review,
you may want to look at the average capital structures for different industries,
which are summarized in the text.) Note: The searches are cumulative, so that if
you ask for the top 10% of the database and follow that by asking for the bottom
5%, you will be shown the bottom 5% of the top 10%. In other words, you
would only see a small subset of the firms you are asking for. Hence, when begin-
ning a new search, clear all existing searches first.
6. From the submenu just above the list of firms, you may choose a number of options.
“List” displays a list of the firms and allows you to access a firm report. “Profiles”
provides key information about the firms, such as ticker, country, exchange, and in-
dustry code. “Financials” gives a couple of key financial figures (expressed in U.S.
dollars) from the firms’ balance sheets and income statements. “Market Data” in-
cludes the firms’ market capitalization, current price, P/E ratio, EPS, and so forth.
“Report Writer” allows you to create customized company reports.
Mini Case
Assume you have just been hired as a business manager of PizzaPalace, a regional pizza restau-
rant chain. The company’s EBIT was $50 million last year and is not expected to grow. The
firm is currently financed with all equity, and it has 10 million shares outstanding. When you
took your corporate finance course, your instructor stated that most firms’ owners would be fi-
nancially better off if the firms used some debt. When you suggested this to your new boss, he
encouraged you to pursue the idea. As a first step, assume that you obtained from the firm’s in-
vestment banker the following estimated costs of debt for the firm at different capital structures:

If the company were to recapitalize, then debt would be issued and the funds received
would be used to repurchase stock. PizzaPalace is in the 40% state-plus-federal corporate tax
bracket, its beta is 1.0, the risk-free rate is 6%, and the market risk premium is 6%.
a. Provide a brief overview of capital structure effects. Be sure to identify the ways in
which capital structure can affect the weighted average cost of capital and free cash
flows.
b. (1) What is business risk? What factors influence a firm’s business risk?
(2) What is operating leverage, and how does it affect a firm’s business risk? Show the
operating break-even point if a company has fixed costs of $200, a sales price of
$15, and variable costs of $10.
c. Now, to develop an example that can be presented to PizzaPalace’s management to il-
lustrate the effects of financial leverage, consider two hypothetical firms: Firm U, which
uses no debt financing, and Firm L, which uses $10,000 of 12% debt. Both firms have
$20,000 in assets, a 40% tax rate, and an expected EBIT of $3,000.
(1) Construct partial income statements, which start with EBIT, for the two firms.
(2) Now calculate ROE for both firms.
(3) What does this example illustrate about the impact of financial leverage on ROE?
d. Explain the difference between financial risk and business risk.
e. What happens to ROE for Firm U and Firm L if EBIT falls to $2,000? What does this
imply about the impact of leverage on risk and return?
f. What does capital structure theory attempt to do? What lessons can be learned from
capital structure theory? Be sure to address the MM models.
g. What does the empirical evidence say about capital structure theory? What are the im-
plications for managers?
h. With the preceding points in mind, now consider the optimal capital structure for
PizzaPalace.
(1) For each capital structure under consideration, calculate the levered beta, the cost
of equity, and the WACC.
(2) Now calculate the corporate value for each capital structure.
i. Describe the recapitalization process and apply it to PizzaPalace. Calculate the resulting
value of the debt that will be issued, the resulting market value of equity, the price per
share, the number of shares repurchased, and the remaining shares. Considering only
the capital structures under analysis, what is PizzaPalace’s optimal capital structure?

hat do U.S. Airways, Apple Computer, Clorox, Kellogg, Dow Chemical, and
Family Dollar Stores have in common? Each led its industry in the latest
CFO Magazine annual survey of working capital management, which
covered the 1,000 largest U.S. publicly traded firms. Each company is rated on its
“days of working capital,” which is the amount of net operating working capital
required per dollar of daily sales:
Days of
working capital ðDWCÞ ¼ Receivables þ Inventory −Payables
Average daily sales
The average U.S. firm’s DWC was 51 days, and the range was from a low
of −154 for CIGNA, a health care provider that collects premiums in advance of
payouts, to +475 for Toll Brothers, a homebuilder with a huge inventory of unsold
houses. Tiffany, the jeweler, had a ratio of 207 due to its policy of extending credit
to boost sales, while Apple achieved a ratio of −29 largely by making Internet sales
and being paid by credit cards well in advance of shipping products and paying its
suppliers.
Variations across industries reflect different operating conditions, but there are
also
huge
differences
within
industries.
For
example,
the
leader
in
the
semiconductor sector, MEMC Electronic Materials, had an investment of only 21
days sales in working capital versus 111 days for another semiconductor firm,
Novellus Systems. Ken Hannah, MEMC’s CFO, made this statement to CFO
Magazine: “Every dollar we free up from working capital can be deployed back
into the business.” He went on to say that MEMC managed to trim its working
capital by 26 days, which released about $340 million. Assuming this money
was used to repay debt that cost 6%, this would boost before-tax profits by
$20.4 million.
How can a company lower its DWC? MEMC reduced its inventories by
adopting just-in-time manufacturing processes, and it lowered receivables by
requiring customers to pay for goods before they were shipped. It did not
“stretch” its own payables. Rather, it asked for and received discounts of as
much as 10% in exchange for early payments, which actually raised its DWC but
also increased its net income. Keep MEMC’s actions in mind as you read this
chapter.

Working capital management involves two basic questions: (1) What is the appropri-
ate amount of working capital, both in total and for each specific account, and (2)
how should working capital be financed? Note that sound working capital manage-
ment goes beyond finance. Indeed, improving the firm’s working capital position
generally comes from improvements in the operating divisions. For example, experts
in logistics, operations management, and information technology often work with
engineers and production specialists to develop ways to speed up the manufacturing
process and thus reduce the goods-in-process inventory. Similarly, marketing
managers and logistics experts cooperate to develop better ways to deliver the firm’s
products to its customers. Finance comes into play in evaluating how effective the
firm’s operating departments are relative to other firms in its industry and also in
evaluating the profitability of alternative proposals for improving working capital
management. In addition, financial managers decide how much cash their companies
should keep on hand and how much short-term financing should be used to finance
their working capital.
Here are some basic definitions and concepts.
1. Working capital, sometimes called gross working capital, simply refers to current
assets used in operations.1
2. Net working capital is defined as current assets minus all current liabilities.

1The term “working capital” originated with the old Yankee peddler, who would load his wagon with
pots and pans and then take off to peddle his wares. His horse and wagon were his fixed assets, while his
merchandise was sold, or turned over at a profit, and thus was called his working capital.

Part 7: Managing Global Operations

3. Net operating working capital (NOWC) is defined as current operating assets
minus current operating liabilities. Generally, NOWC is equal to cash required in
operations, accounts receivable, and inventories, less accounts payable and
accruals. Marketable securities not used in operations, cash in excess of operating
needs, and other short-term investments are generally not considered to be
operating current assets, so they are typically excluded when NOWC is calcu-
lated. The firm itself determines how much of its cash is required for operations,
but all of the cash of most firms is used in operations.
16.1 CURRENT ASSET HOLDINGS
Current assets can be divided into two categories, operating and nonoperating. Operating
current assets consist of cash plus marketable securities held as a substitute for operating
cash, inventories, and accounts receivable. These are assets that are necessary to operate
the business. Nonoperating current assets consist of any other current assets, principally
short-term securities in excess of what is required in operations, funds held in case a good
merger opportunity arises, cash from the sale of a stock or bond issue before the funds can
be invested in fixed assets, or funds held in case the firm loses a lawsuit and is required to
compensate the winning party. Our focus in this section is strictly on operating current assets.
The amount of operating current assets held is a policy decision, and one that af-
fects profitability. Figure 16-1 shows three alternative policies regarding the size of
the firm’s operating current assets. The top line has the steepest slope, which indi-
cates that the firm holds a lot of cash, marketable securities, receivables, and invento-
ries relative to its sales. If receivables are high, the firm has a liberal credit policy that
results in a high level of accounts receivable. This is a relaxed policy. On the other
hand, if a firm has a restricted, tight, or “lean-and-mean” policy, holdings of current
assets are minimized. A moderate policy lies between the two extremes.
We can use the Du Pont equation to demonstrate how working capital manage-
ment affects the return on equity:
ROE ¼ Profit margin × Total assets turnover × Equity multiplier
¼ Net income
Sales
× Sales
Assets × Assets
Equity
A relaxed policy means a high level of assets and hence a low total assets turnover ratio;
this results in a low ROE, other things held constant. Conversely, a restricted policy
results in low current assets, a high turnover, and hence a relatively high ROE. How-
ever, the restricted policy exposes the firm to risk, because shortages can lead to work
stoppages, unhappy customers, and serious long-run problems. The moderate policy
falls between the two extremes. The optimal strategy is the one that management
believes will maximize the firm’s long-run earnings and thus the stock’s intrinsic value.
Note that changing technologies can lead to changes in the optimal policy. For
example, if a new technology makes it possible for a manufacturer to produce a given
product in 5 rather than 10 days, then work-in-progress inventories can be cut in
half. Similarly, retailers such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot have inventory manage-
ment systems that use bar codes on all merchandise. These codes are read at the cash
register, this information is transmitted electronically to a computer that adjusts the
remaining stock of the item, and the computer automatically places an order with the
supplier’s computer when the stock falls to a specified level. This process lowers the
“safety stocks” that would otherwise be necessary to avoid running out of stock. Such
systems have dramatically lowered inventories and thus boosted profits.

16.2 CURRENT ASSETS FINANCING POLICIES
Investments in operating current assets must be financed, and the primary sources of
funds include bank loans, credit from suppliers (accounts payable), accrued liabilities,
long-term debt, and common equity. Each of those sources has advantages and dis-
advantages, so a firm must decide which sources are best for it.
To begin, note that most businesses experience seasonal and/or cyclical fluctua-
tions. For example, construction firms tend to peak in the summer, retailers peak
around Christmas, and the manufacturers who supply both construction companies
and retailers follow related patterns. Similarly, the sales of virtually all businesses
increase when the economy is strong, so they increase current operating assets during
booms but let inventories and receivables fall during recessions. However, current
assets rarely drop to zero—companies maintain some permanent current operating
assets, which are the current operating assets needed even at the low point of the

business cycle. For a growing firm in a growing economy, permanent current assets
tend to increase over time. Also, as sales increase during a cyclical upswing, current
assets are increased; these extra current assets are defined as temporary current op-
erating assets as opposed to permanent current assets. The way permanent and tem-
porary current assets are financed is called the firm’s current operating assets
financing policy. Three alternative policies are discussed next.
Maturity Matching, or “Self-Liquidating,” Approach
The maturity matching, or “self-liquidating,” approach calls for matching asset
and liability maturities as shown in Panel a of Figure 16-2. All of the fixed assets
plus the permanent current assets are financed with long-term capital, but temporary
current assets are financed with short-term debt. Inventory expected to be sold in
30 days would be financed with a 30-day bank loan; a machine expected to last for
5 years would be financed with a 5-year loan; a 20-year building would be financed
with a 20-year mortgage bond; and so on. Actually, two factors prevent an exact
maturity matching: (1) The lives of assets are uncertain. For example, a firm might
finance inventories with a 30-day bank loan, expecting to sell the inventories and
use the cash to retire the loan. But if sales are slow, then the cash would not be forth-
coming and the firm might not be able to pay off the loan when it matures. (2) Some
common equity must be used, and common equity has no maturity. Still, if a firm
attempts to match or come close to matching asset and liability maturities, this is
defined as a moderate current asset financing policy.
Aggressive Approach
Panel b of Figure 16-2 illustrates the situation for a more aggressive firm that fi-
nances some of its permanent assets with short-term debt. Note that we used the
term “relatively” in the title for Panel b because there can be different degrees of ag-
gressiveness. For example, the dashed line in Panel b could have been drawn below
the line designating fixed assets, indicating that all of the current assets—both perma-
nent and temporary—and part of the fixed assets were financed with short-term
credit. This policy would be a highly aggressive, extremely nonconservative position,
and the firm would be subject to dangers from loan renewal as well as rising interest
rate problems. However, short-term interest rates are generally lower than long-term
rates, and some firms are willing to gamble by using a large amount of low-cost,
short-term debt in hopes of earning higher profits.
A possible reason for adopting the aggressive policy is to take advantage of an up-
ward sloping yield curve, for which short-term rates are lower than long-term rates.
However, as many firms learned during the financial crisis of 2009, a strategy of fi-
nancing long-term assets with short-term debt is really quite risky. As an illustration,
suppose a company borrowed $1 million on a 1-year basis and used the funds to buy
machinery that would lower labor costs by $200,000 per year for 10 years.2 Cash
flows from the equipment would not be sufficient to pay off the loan at the end of
only one year, so the loan would have to be renewed. If the economy were in a reces-
sion like that of 2009, the lender might refuse to renew the loan, and that could lead
to bankruptcy. Had the firm matched maturities and financed the equipment with a
10-year loan, then the annual loan payments would have been lower and better
matched with the cash flows, and the loan renewal problem would not have arisen.
2We are oversimplifying here. Few lenders would explicitly lend money for one year to finance a 10-year
asset. What would actually happen is that the firm would borrow on a 1-year basis for “general corporate
purposes” and then actually use the money to purchase the 10-year machinery.

Part 7: Managing Global Operations

Under some circumstances even maturity matching can be risky, as many firms that
thought they were conservatively financed learned in 2009. If a firm borrowed on a
30-day bank loan to finance inventories that it expected to sell within 30 days but then
sales dropped, as they did for many firms in 2009, the funds needed to pay off the matur-
ing bank loan might not be available. Then the bank might not extend the loan, and if it
did not then the firm could be forced into bankruptcy. This happened to many firms in
2009, and it was exacerbated by the banks’ own problems. The banks had lost billions on
mortgages, mortgage-backed bonds, and other bad investments, which led banks to
restrict credit to their normal business customers in order to conserve their own cash.
Conservative Approach
Panel c of the figure shows the dashed line above the line designating permanent cur-
rent assets, indicating that long-term capital is used to finance all permanent assets
and also to meet some seasonal needs. In this situation, the firm uses a small amount
of short-term credit to meet its peak requirements, but it also meets a part of its sea-
sonal needs by “storing liquidity” in the form of marketable securities. The humps
above the dashed line represent short-term financings, while the troughs below the
dashed line represent short-term security holdings. This conservative financing pol-
icy is fairly safe, and the wisdom of using it was demonstrated in 2009: when credit
dried up, firms with adequate cash holdings were able to operate more effectively
than those that were forced to cut back their operations because they couldn’t order
new inventories or pay their normal workforce.
Choosing among the Approaches
Because the yield curve is normally upward sloping, the cost of short-term debt is gener-
ally lower than that of long-term debt. However, short-term debt is riskier to the borrowing
firm for two reasons: (1) If a firm borrows on a long-term basis then its interest costs
will be relatively stable over time, but if it uses short-term credit then its interest ex-
pense can fluctuate widely—perhaps reaching such high levels that profits are extin-
guished.3 (2) If a firm borrows heavily on a short-term basis, then a temporary
recession may adversely affect its financial ratios and render it unable to repay its
debt. Recognizing this fact, the lender may not renew the loan if the borrower’s fi-
nancial position is weak, which could force the borrower into bankruptcy.
Note also that short-term loans can generally be negotiated much faster than long-term
loans. Lenders need to make a thorough financial examination before extending
long-term credit, and the loan agreement must be spelled out in great detail because
a lot can happen during the life of a 10- to 20-year loan.
Finally, short-term debt generally offers greater flexibility. If the firm thinks that inter-
est rates are abnormally high and due for a decline, it may prefer short-term credit
because prepayment penalties are often attached to long-term debt. Also, if its needs
for funds are seasonal or cyclical, then the firm may not want to commit itself to
long-term debt because of its underwriting costs and possible prepayment penalties.
Finally, long-term loan agreements generally contain provisions, or covenants, that
constrain the firm’s future actions in order to protect the lender, whereas short-
term credit agreements generally have fewer restrictions.
3The prime interest rate—the rate banks charge very good customers—hit 21% in the early 1980s. This
produced a level of business bankruptcies that was not seen again until 2009. The primary reason for the
very high interest rate was that the inflation rate was up to 13%, and high inflation must be compensated
by high interest rates. Also, the Federal Reserve was tightening credit in order to hold down inflation, and
it was encouraging banks to restrict their lending.
Chapter 16: Working Capital Management
647

All things considered, it is not possible to state that either long-term or short-term
financing is generally better. The firm’s specific conditions will affect its decision, as
will the risk preferences of managers. Optimistic and/or aggressive managers will lean
more toward short-term credit to gain an interest cost advantage, whereas more con-
servative managers will lean toward long-term financing to avoid potential renewal
problems. The factors discussed here should be considered, but the final decision
will reflect managers’ personal preferences and subjective judgments.

16.3 THE CASH CONVERSION CYCLE
All firms follow a “working capital cycle” in which they purchase or produce inven-
tory, hold it for a time, and then sell it and receive cash. This process is known as the
cash conversion cycle (CCC).
Calculating the Target CCC
Assume that Great Basin Medical Equipment (GBM) is just starting in business, buy-
ing orthopedic devices from a manufacturer in China and selling them through dis-
tributors in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Its business plan calls for it to
purchase $10,000,000 of merchandise at the start of each month and have it sold
within 50 days. The company will have 40 days to pay its suppliers, and it will give
its customers 60 days to pay for their purchases. GBM expects to just break even dur-
ing its first few years and so its monthly sales will be $10,000,000, the same as its
purchases (or cost of goods sold). For simplicity, assume that there are no administra-
tive costs. Also, any funds required to support operations will be obtained from the
bank, and those loans must be repaid as soon as cash becomes available.
This information can be used to calculate GBM’s target, or theoretical, cash con-
version cycle, which “nets out” the three time periods described below.4
1. Inventory conversion period. For GBM, this is the 50 days it expects to take to
sell the equipment, converting it from equipment to accounts receivable.5
2. Average collection period (ACP). This is the length of time customers are
given to pay for goods following a sale. The ACP is also called the days sales
outstanding (DSO). GBM’s business plan calls for an ACP of 60 days based on its
60-day credit terms. This is also called the receivables conversion period, as it is
supposed to take 60 days to collect and thus convert receivables to cash.
3. Payables deferral period. This is the length of time GBM’s suppliers give it to
pay for its purchases, which in our example is 40 days.
On Day 1, GBM expects to buy merchandise, and it expects to sell the goods and
thus convert them to accounts receivable within 50 days. It should then take 60 days to
collect the receivables, making a total of 110 days between receiving merchandise and
collecting cash. However, GBM is able to defer its own payments for only 40 days.
4See Verlyn D. Richards and Eugene J. Laughlin, “A Cash Conversion Cycle Approach to Liquidity
Analysis,” Financial Management, Spring 1980, pp. 32–38.
5If GBM were a manufacturer, the inventory conversion period would be the time required to convert
raw materials into finished goods and then to sell those goods.
648
Part 7: Managing Global Operations

We can combine these three periods to find the theoretical, or target, cash con-
version cycle, shown below as an equation and diagrammed in Figure 16-3.

Although GBM is supposed to pay its suppliers $10,000,000 after 40 days, it does
not expect to receive any cash until 50 + 60 = 110 days into the cycle. Therefore, it
will have to borrow the $10,000,000 cost of the merchandise from its bank on
Day 40, and it does not expect to be able to repay the loan until it collects on Day
110. Thus, for 110 −40 = 70 days—which is the theoretical cash conversion cycle
(CCC)—it will owe the bank $10,000,000 and it will be paying interest on this debt.
The shorter the cash conversion cycle the better, because a shorter CCC means
lower interest charges.
Observe that if GBM could sell goods faster, collect receivables faster, or defer its
payables longer without hurting sales or increasing operating costs, then its CCC
would decline, its expected interest charges would be reduced, and its expected prof-
its and stock price would be improved.
Calculating the Actual CCC from Financial Statements
So far we have illustrated the CCC from a theoretical standpoint. However, in
practice we would generally calculate the CCC based on the firm’s financial state-
ments, and the actual CCC would almost certainly differ from the theoretical
value because of real-world complexities such as shipping delays, sales slowdowns,
and slow-paying customers. Moreover, a firm such as GBM would be continually
starting new cycles before the earlier ones ended, and this too would muddy the
waters.
To see how the CCC is calculated in practice, assume that GBM has been in busi-
ness for several years and is in a stable position, placing orders, making sales, receiv-
ing payments, and making its own payments on a recurring basis. The following data
were taken from its latest financial statements, in millions:

Thus, its net operating working capital due to inventory, receivables, and payables is
$140 + $445 −$115 = $470 million, and that amount must be financed—in GBM’s
case, through bank loans at a 10% interest rate. Therefore, its interest expense is $47
million per year.
We can analyze the situation more closely. First, consider the inventory conver-
sion period:6
Inventory conversion period ¼
Inventory
Cost of goods sold per day
(16-2)
¼
$140:0
$1;013:9=365 ¼ 50:4 days
Thus, it takes GBM an average of 50.4 days to sell its merchandise, which is very
close to the 50 days called for in the business plan. Note also that inventory is carried
at cost, which explains why the denominator in Equation 16-2 is the cost of goods
sold per day, not daily sales.
The average collection period (or days sales outstanding) is calculated next:
Average collection period ¼ ACPðor DSOÞ ¼ Receivables
Sales=365
(16-3)
¼
$445:0
$1;216:7=365 ¼ 133:5 days
Thus, it takes GBM 133.5 days after a sale to receive cash, not the 60 days called
for in its business plan. Because receivables are recorded at the sales price, we
use daily sales (rather than the cost of goods sold per day) in the denominator for
the ACP.
The payables deferral period is found as follows, again using daily cost of goods
sold in the denominator because payables are recorded at cost:
Payables
deferral period ¼
Payables
Purchases per day ¼
Payables
Cost of goods sold=365
(16-4)
¼
$115:0
$1;013:9=365 ¼ 41:4 days
6In past editions of this book we divided inventories by daily sales to be consistent with many reported
data sources. We believe that dividing by daily cost of goods sold provides a more meaningful cash con-
version period, so we changed the formula in this edition.

Part 7: Managing Global Operations

GBM is supposed to pay its suppliers after 40 days, but it actually pays on average
just after Day 41. This slight delay is normal, since mail delays and time for checks
to be cashed generally slow payments down a bit.
We can now combine the three periods to calculate GBM’s actual cash conversion
cycle:
Cash conversion cycleðCCCÞ ¼ 50:4 days þ 133:5 days −41:4 days ¼ 142:5 days
Figure 16-4 summarizes all of these calculations and then analyzes why the actual
CCC exceeds the theoretical CCC by such a large amount. It is clear from the figure
that the firm’s inventory control is working as expected in that sales match the inflow
of new inventory items quite well. Also, its own payments match reasonably well the
terms under which it buys. However, its accounts receivable are much higher than
they should be, indicating that its customers are not paying on time. In fact, they

Note: GBM’s inventories are in line with its plans, and it’s paying its suppliers nearly on time. However, some of
its customers are paying quite late, so its average collection period (or DSO) is 133.5 days even though all
customers are supposed to pay by Day 60.

are paying 73.5 days late, which is increasing GBM’s working capital. Because work-
ing capital must be financed, the collections delay is lowering the firm’s profits and
presumably hurting its stock price.
When the CFO reviewed the situation, she discovered that GBM’s customers—
doctors, hospitals, and clinics—were themselves reimbursed by insurance compa-
nies and government units, and those organizations were paying late. The credit
manager was doing everything he could to collect faster, but the customers said
that they just could not make their own payments until they themselves were paid.
If GBM wanted to keep making sales, it seemed that it would have to accept late-
paying customers. However, the CFO wondered if collections might come in faster
if GBM offered substantial discounts for early payments. We will take up this issue
later in the chapter.
Benefits of Reducing the CCC
As we have seen, GBM currently has a CCC of 142.5 days, which results in $470
million being tied up in net operating working capital. Assuming that its cost of
debt to carry working capital is 10%, this means that the firm is incurring interest
charges of $47 million per year to carry its working capital. Now suppose the com-
pany can speed up its sales enough to reduce the inventory conversion period from
50.4 to 35.0 days. In addition, it begins to offer discounts for early payment and
thereby reduces its average collection period to 40 days. Finally, assume that it could
negotiate a change in its own payment terms from 40 to 50 days. The “New” column
of Figure 16-5 shows the net effects of these improvements: a 117.5-day reduction in
the cash conversion cycle and a reduction in net operating working capital from
$470.0 to $91.7 million, which saves $37.8 million of interest.
Recall also that free cash flow (FCF) is equal to NOPAT minus the net new in-
vestment in operating capital. Therefore, if working capital decreases by a given
amount while other things remain constant, then FCF increases by that same
amount—$378.3 million in the GBM example. If sales remained constant in the fol-

lowing years, then this reduction in working capital would simply be a one-time cash
inflow. However, suppose sales grow in future years. When a company improves its
working capital management, the components (inventory conversion period, collec-
tion period, and payments period) usually remain at their improved levels, which
means the NOWC/Sales ratio remains at its new level. With an improved NOWC/
Sales ratio, less working capital will be required to support future sales, leading to
higher annual FCFs than would have otherwise existed.
Thus, an improvement in working capital management creates a large one-time
increase in FCF at the time of the improvement as well as higher FCF in future
years. Therefore, an improvement in working capital management is a gift that keeps
on giving.
These benefits can add substantial value to the company. Professors Hyun-Han
Shin and Luc Soenen studied more than 2,900 companies over a 20-year period,
finding a strong relationship between a company’s cash conversion cycle and its stock
performance.7 For an average company, a 10-day improvement in its CCC was asso-
ciated with an increase in pre-tax operating profit margin from 12.76% to 13.02%.
Moreover, companies with cash conversion cycles 10 days shorter than the average
for their industry had annual stock returns that were 1.7 percentage points higher
than the average company. Given results like these, it’s no wonder firms place so
much emphasis on working capital management!8

capital.
Dell
Computer
and
Amazon.com are examples. When customers order
computers from Dell’s Web site or books from Amazon,
they must provide a credit card number. Dell and Ama-
zon then receive next-day cash, even before the product
is shipped and even before they have paid their own
suppliers. This results in a negative CCC, which means
that working capital provides cash rather than using it.
In order to grow, companies normally need cash
for working capital. However, if the CCC is negative
then growth in sales provides cash rather than uses
it. This cash can be invested in plant and equipment,
research and development, or for any other corporate
purpose. Analysts recognize this point when they
value Dell and Amazon, and it certainly helps their
stock prices.

16.4 THE CASH BUDGET
Firms must forecast their cash flows. If they are likely to need additional cash
then they should line up funds well in advance, yet if they are likely to generate
surplus cash then they should plan for its productive use. The primary forecasting
tool is the cash budget, illustrated in Figure 16-6, which is a printout from the
chapter’s Excel Tool Kit model. The illustrative company is Educational Products
Corporation (EPC), which supplies educational materials to schools and retailers
in the Midwest. Sales are cyclical, peaking in September and then declining for
the balance of the year.

Notes:
1. Although the budget period is July through December, sales and purchases data for May and June are needed to determine collec-
tions and payments during July and August.
2. Firms can both borrow and pay off commercial loans on a daily basis, so the $26.2 million loan needed for July would likely be
gradually borrowed as needed on a daily basis, and during October the $234.8 million loan that presumably existed at the beginning
of the month would be reduced daily to the $86.2 million ending balance—which in turn, would be completely paid off sometime
during November.

Part 7: Managing Global Operations

Monthly Cash Budgets
Cash budgets can be of any length, but EPC and most companies use a monthly cash
budget such as the one in Figure 16-6, but set up for 12 months. We used only
6 months for the purpose of illustration. The monthly budget is used for longer-
range planning, but a daily cash budget is also prepared at the start of each month
to provide a more precise picture of the daily cash flows for use in scheduling actual
payments on a day-by-day basis.
The cash budget focuses on cash flows, but it also includes information on fore-
casted sales, credit policy, and inventory management. Since the statement is a fore-
cast and not a report on historical results, actual results could vary from the figures
given. Therefore, the cash budget is generally set up as an expected, or base-case,
forecast, but it is created with a model that makes it easy to generate alternative fore-
casts to see what would happen under different conditions.
Figure 16-6 begins with a forecast of sales for each month on Row 74. Then, on
Row 75, it shows possible percentage deviations from the forecasted sales. Since we
are showing the base-case forecast, no adjustments are made, but the model is set up
to show the effects if sales increase or decrease and so result in “adjusted sales” that
are above or below the forecasted levels.
The company sells on terms of “2/10, net 60.” This means that a 2% discount is
given if payment is made within 10 days; otherwise, the full amount is due in 60 days.
However, like most companies, EPC finds that some customers pay late. Experience
shows that 20% of customers pay during the month of the sale and take the discount.
Another 70% pay during the month immediately following the sale, and 10% are
late, paying in the second month after the sale.9
The statement (Line 85) next shows forecasted materials purchases, which equal
60% of the following month’s sales. EPC buys on terms of net 30, meaning that it
receives no discounts and is required to pay for its purchases within 30 days of the
purchase date. The purchases information is followed by forecasted payments for ma-
terials, labor, leases, other payments such as dividends and interest on long-term
bonds, taxes (due in September and December), and a payment of $150 million in
September for a new plant that is being constructed.
When the total forecasted payments are subtracted from the forecasted collec-
tions, the result is the expected net cash gain or loss for each month. This gain or
loss is added to or subtracted from the excess cash on hand at the start of the forecast
(which we assume was zero), and the result—the cumulative net cash flow—is the
amount of cash the firm would have on hand at the end of the month if it neither
borrowed nor invested.
EPC’s target cash balance is $10 million, and it plans either to borrow to meet this
target or to invest surplus funds if it generates more cash than it needs. How the tar-
get cash balance is determined is discussed later in the chapter, but EPC believes that
it needs $10 million.
By subtracting the target cash balance from the cumulative cash flow, we calculate
the loan needed or surplus cash, as shown on Row 102. A negative number indicates that
we need a loan, whereas a positive number indicates that we forecast surplus cash that
is available for investment or other uses.
9A negligible percentage of sales results in bad debts. The low bad-debt losses evident here result from
EPC’s careful screening of customers and its generally tight credit policies. However, the cash budget
model is able to show the effects of bad debts, so EPC’s CFO could show top management how cash
flows would be affected if the firm relaxed its credit policy in order to stimulate sales or if the recession
worsened and more customers were forced to delay payments.
Chapter 16: Working Capital Management
655

If we total the net cash flows on Row 97 then the sum is $37 million, the cumula-
tive NCF as shown in Cell M98. Because this number is positive, it indicates that
EPC’s cash flow is positive. Also, note that EPC borrows on a basis that allows it to
borrow or repay loans on a daily basis. Thus, it would borrow a total of $26.2 million
in July, increasing the loan daily, and would continue to build up the loan through
September. Then, when its cash flows turn positive in October, it would start repay-
ing the loan on a daily basis and completely pay it off sometime in November, as-
suming that everything works out as forecasted.
Note that our cash budget is incomplete in that it shows neither interest paid on
the working capital loans nor interest earned on the positive cash balances. These
amounts could be added to the budget simply by adding rows and including them.
Similarly, if the firm makes quarterly dividend payments, principal payments on its
long-term bonds, or any other payments, or if it has investment income, then those
cash flows also could be added to the statement. In our simplified statement, we just
lumped all such payments into “other payments.”
Under the base-case forecast, the CFO will need to arrange a line of credit so that the
firm can borrow up to $234.8 million, increasing the loan over time as funds are needed
and repaying it later when cash flows become positive. The treasurer would show the
cash budget to the bankers when negotiating for the line of credit. Lenders would want
to know how much the firm expects to need, when the funds will be needed, and when
the loan will be repaid. The lenders—and EPC’s top executives—would question the
treasurer about the budget, and they would want to know how the forecasts would be
affected if sales were higher or lower than those projected, how changes in customers’
payment times would affect the forecasts, and the like. The focus would be on these
two questions: How accurate is the forecast likely to be? What would be the effects of significant
errors? The first question could best be answered by examining historical forecasts, and
the second by running different scenarios as we do in the Excel Tool Kit model.
No matter how hard we try, no forecast will ever be exactly correct, and this in-
cludes cash budgets. You can imagine the bank’s reaction if the company negotiated a
loan of $235 million and then came back a few months later saying that it had under-
estimated its requirements and needed to boost the loan to say $260 million. The
banker might well refuse, thinking the company was not very well managed. There-
fore, EPC’s treasurer would undoubtedly want to build a cushion into the line of
credit—say, a maximum commitment of $260 million rather than the forecasted re-
quirement of $234.8 million. However, as we discuss later in the chapter, banks
charge commitment fees for guaranteed lines of credit; thus, the higher the cushion
built into the line of credit, the more costly the credit will be. This is another reason
why it is important to develop accurate forecasts.
Cash Budgets versus Income Statements
and Free Cash Flows
If you look at the cash budget, it looks similar to an income statement. However, the two
statements are quite different. Here are some key differences: (1) In an income state-
ment, the focus would be on sales, not collections. (2) An income statement would
show accrued taxes, wages, and so forth, not the actual payments. (3) An income state-
ment would show depreciation as an expense, but it would not show expenditures on
new fixed assets. (4) An income statement would show a cost for goods purchased when
those goods were sold, not for when they were ordered or paid.
These are obviously large differences, so it would be a big mistake to confuse a cash
budget with an income statement. Also, the cash flows shown on the cash budget are
resource
See Ch16 Tool Kit.xls on
the textbook’s Web site
for details.
656
Part 7: Managing Global Operations

different from the firm’s free cash flows, because FCF reflects after-tax operating in-
come and the investments required to maintain future operations whereas the cash
budget reflects only the actual cash inflows and outflows during a particular period.
The bottom line is that cash budgets, income statements, and free cash flows are
all important and are related to one another, but they are also quite different. Each is
designed for a specific purpose, and the main purpose of the cash budget is to fore-
cast the firm’s liquidity position, not its profitability.
Daily Cash Budgets
Note that if cash inflows and outflows do not occur uniformly during each month,
then the actual funds needed might be quite different from the indicated amounts.
The data in Figure 16-6 show the situation on the last day of each month, and we
see that the maximum projected loan during the forecast period is $234.8 million. Yet
if all payments had to be made on the 1st of the month but most collections came on
the 30th, then EPC would have to make $270 million of payments in July before it
received the $253.8 million from collections. In that case, the firm would need to
borrow about $270 million in July, not the $26.2 million shown in Figure 16-6. This
would make the bank unhappy—perhaps so unhappy that it would not extend the re-
quested credit. A daily cash budget would have revealed this situation.
Figure 16-6 was prepared using Excel, which makes it easy to change the assump-
tions. In the Tool Kit model we examine the cash flow effects of changes in sales, in
customers’ payment patterns, and so forth. Also, the effects of changes in credit pol-
icy and inventory management could be examined through the cash budget.
Self-Test
How could the cash budget be used when negotiating the terms of a bank loan?
How would a shift from a tight credit policy to a relaxed policy be likely to affect a
firm’s cash budget?
How would the cash budget be affected if our firm’s suppliers offered us terms of
“2/10, net 30,” rather than “net 30,” and we decided to take the discount?
Suppose a firm’s cash flows do not occur uniformly throughout the month.
What effect would this have on the accuracy of the forecasted borrowing require-
ments based on a monthly cash budget? How could the firm deal with this problem?
16.5 CASH MANAGEMENT AND THE TARGET
CASH BALANCE
Cash is needed to pay for labor and raw materials, to purchase fixed assets, to pay
taxes, to service debt, to pay dividends, and so on, but cash itself (and the money in
most commercial checking accounts) earns no interest. Thus, the goal of the cash
manager is to minimize the cash amount the firm must hold for conducting its nor-
mal business activities while continuing to maintain a sufficient cash reserve to (1)
take trade discounts, (2) pay promptly and thus maintain its credit rating, and (3)
meet any unexpected cash needs. We begin our analysis with a discussion of the tra-
ditional reasons for holding cash.
Reasons for Holding Cash
Firms hold cash for two primary reasons:
1. Transactions, both routine and precautionary. Cash balances are necessary in
business operations. Payments must be made in cash, and receipts are
resource
See Ch16 Tool Kit.xls on
the textbook’s Web site
for details.
Chapter 16: Working Capital Management
657

deposited in the cash account. Cash balances associated with routine payments
and collections are known as transactions balances. Cash inflows and out-
flows are unpredictable, and the degree of predictability varies among firms
and industries. Therefore, firms need to hold some cash to meet random,
unforeseen fluctuations in inflows and outflows. These “safety stocks” are
called precautionary balances, and the less predictable the firm’s cash flows,
the larger such balances should be.
2. Compensation to banks for providing loans and services. A bank makes money by lend-
ing out funds that have been deposited with it, so the larger its deposits, the better
the bank’s profit position. If a bank is providing services to a customer then it may
require that customer to leave a minimum balance on deposit to help offset the costs
of providing those services. Also, banks may require borrowers to hold their trans-
actions deposits at the bank. Both types of deposits are called compensating bal-
ances. In a 1979 survey, 84.7% of responding companies reported they were
required to maintain compensating balances to help pay for bank services; only
13.3% reported paying direct fees for banking services.10 By 1996, those findings
were reversed: Only 28% paid for bank services with compensating balances, while
83% paid direct fees.11 Although the use of compensating balances to pay for ser-
vices has declined, these balances improve a firm’s relationship with its bank and are
still a reason why some companies hold additional cash.
In addition to holding cash for transactions, precautionary, and compensating bal-
ances, it is essential that the firm have sufficient cash to take trade discounts. Sup-
The CFO Cash Management Scorecard
Each year CFO Magazine publishes a cash management
scorecard, prepared by REL Consultancy Group, based
on the 1,000 largest publicly traded U.S. companies. On
the one hand, if a company holds more cash than
needed to support its operations, its return on invested
capital (ROIC) will be dragged down because cash
earns a low rate of return. On the other hand, if a com-
pany doesn’t have enough cash, then it might experi-

that these firms have the best cash management proce-
dures. A recent average benchmark cash/sales ratio
was 5.6%, whereas the average firm had a ratio of
10.4%. This suggests that many firms had a lot more
cash than they actually needed.
It’s one thing to talk about reducing cash, but how
can a company do it? A good relationship with its banks
is one key to keeping low cash levels. Jim Hopwood,
treasurer of Wickes, says, “We have a credit revolver if
we ever need it.” The same is true at Havertys Furni-
ture, where CFO Dennis Fink says that if you have solid
bank commitments, “You don’t have to worry about
predicting short-term fluctuations in cash flow.”

pliers frequently offer customers discounts for early payment of bills. As we will see
later in this chapter, the cost of not taking discounts is sometimes very high, so firms
should have enough cash to permit payment of bills in time to take discounts.
Finally, for a number of reasons firms often hold short-term investments in excess
of the cash needed to support operations. We discuss short-term investments later in

Why is cash management important?
What are the primary motives for holding cash?
16.6 CASH MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES
In terms of dollar volume, most business is conducted by large firms, many of which
operate nationally or globally. They collect cash from many sources and make pay-
ments from a number of different cities or even countries. For example, companies
such as IBM, General Electric, and Hewlett-Packard have manufacturing plants all
around the world, even more sales offices, and bank accounts in virtually every city
where they do business. Their collection centers follow sales patterns. However,
while some disbursements are made from local offices, most are made in the cities
where manufacturing occurs or else from the home office. Thus, a major corporation
might have hundreds or even thousands of bank accounts located in cities all over the
globe, but there is no reason to think that inflows and outflows will balance in each
account. Therefore, a system must be in place to transfer funds from where they
come in to where they are needed, to arrange loans to cover net corporate shortfalls,
and to invest net corporate surpluses without delay. Some commonly used techniques
for accomplishing these tasks are discussed next.12
Synchronizing Cash Flow
If you as an individual were to receive income once a year, then you would probably
put it in the bank, draw down your account periodically, and have an average balance
for the year equal to about half of your annual income. If instead you received in-
come weekly and paid rent, tuition, and other charges on a daily basis, then your av-
erage bank balance would still be about half of your periodic receipts and thus only
1/52 as large as if you received income only once annually.
Exactly the same situation holds for businesses: By timing their cash receipts to
coincide with their cash outlays, firms can hold their transactions balances to a mini-
mum. Recognizing this fact, firms such as utilities, oil companies, and credit card
companies arrange to bill customers—and to pay their own bills—on regular “billing
cycles” throughout the month. This synchronization of cash flows provides cash
when it is needed and thus enables firms to reduce their average cash balances.
Speeding Up the Check-Clearing Process
When a customer writes and mails a check, the funds are not available to the receiv-
ing firm until the check-clearing process has been completed. First, the check must
be delivered through the mail. Checks received from customers in distant cities are
especially subject to mail delays.
When a customer’s check is written on one bank and a company deposits the
check in another bank, the company’s bank must verify that the check is valid before
12For more information on cash management, see Bruce J. Summers, “Clearing and Payment Systems:
The Role of the Central Bank,” Federal Reserve Bulletin, February 1991, pp. 81–91.
Chapter 16: Working Capital Management
659

the payee can use those funds. Checks are generally cleared through the Federal Re-
serve System or through a clearinghouse set up by the banks in a particular city.13
Before 2004, this process sometimes took 2 to 5 days. But with the passage of a fed-
eral law in 2004 known as “Check 21,” banks can exchange digital images of checks.
This means that most checks now clear in a single day.
Using Float
Float is defined as the difference between the balance shown in a firm’s (or indivi-
dual’s) checkbook and the balance on the bank’s records. Suppose a firm writes, on
average, checks in the amount of $5,000 each day, and suppose it takes 6 days for
these checks to clear and be deducted from the firm’s bank account. This will cause
the firm’s own checkbook to show a balance that is $30,000 smaller than the balance
on the bank’s records; this difference is called disbursement float. Now suppose the
firm also receives checks in the amount of $5,000 daily but that it loses 4 days while
those checks are being deposited and cleared. This will result in $20,000 of collec-
tions float. In total, the firm’s net float—the difference between the $30,000 posi-
tive disbursement float and the $20,000 negative collections float—will be $10,000.
In sum, collections float is bad, disbursement float is good, and positive net float is
even better.
Delays that cause float will occur because it takes time for checks to (1) travel
through the mail (mail float), (2) be processed by the receiving firm (processing
float), and (3) clear through the banking system (clearing, or availability, float). Basi-
cally, the size of a firm’s net float is a function of its ability to speed up collections on
checks it receives and to slow down collections on checks it writes. Efficient firms go
to great lengths to speed up the processing of incoming checks, thus putting the
funds to work faster, and they try to stretch their own payments out as long as possi-
ble, sometimes by disbursing checks from banks in remote locations.
Speeding Up Collections
Two major techniques are used to speed collections and to get funds where they are
needed: lockboxes and electronic transfers.
Lockboxes.
A lockbox system is one of the oldest cash management tools. In a
lockbox system, incoming checks are sent to post office boxes rather than to the
firm’s corporate headquarters. For example, a firm headquartered in New York City
might have its West Coast customers send their payments to a post office box in San
Francisco, its customers in the Southwest send their checks to Dallas, and so on,
rather than having all checks sent to New York City. Several times a day, a local
bank will empty the lockbox and deposit the checks into the company’s local account.
The bank then provides the firm with a daily record of the receipts collected, usually
via an electronic data transmission system in a format that permits online updating of
the firm’s accounts receivable records.
13For example, suppose a check for $100 is written on Bank A and deposited at Bank B. Bank B will usu-
ally contact either the Federal Reserve System or a clearinghouse to which both banks belong. The Fed
or the clearinghouse will then verify with Bank A that the check is valid and that the account has suffi-
cient funds to cover the check. Bank A’s account with the Fed or the clearinghouse is then reduced by
$100, and Bank B’s account is increased by $100. Of course, if the check is deposited in the same bank
on which it was drawn, that bank merely transfers funds by bookkeeping entries from one depositor to
another.
660
Part 7: Managing Global Operations

A lockbox system reduces the time required to receive incoming checks, to deposit
them, and to get them cleared through the banking system and available for use. Lockbox
services can make funds available as many as 2 to 5 days faster than via the “regular” system.
Payment by Wire or Automatic Debit.
Firms are increasingly demanding pay-
ments of larger bills by wire or by automatic electronic debits. Under an electronic debit
system, funds are automatically deducted from one account and added to another. This
is, of course, the ultimate in a speeded-up collection process, and computer technology is
making such a process increasingly feasible and efficient, even for retail transactions.

16.7 INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
Inventory management techniques are covered in depth in production management
courses. Still, financial managers have a responsibility for raising the capital needed
to carry inventory and for overseeing the firm’s overall profitability, so it is appropri-
ate that we cover the financial aspects of inventory management here.
The twin goals of inventory management are (1) to ensure that the inventories
needed to sustain operations are available, but (2) to hold the costs of ordering and car-
rying inventories to the lowest possible level. While analyzing improvements in the cash
conversion cycle, we identified some of the cash flows associated with a reduction in in-
ventory. In addition to the points made earlier, lower inventory levels reduce costs due
to storage and handling, insurance, property taxes, spoilage, and obsolescence.
Before the computer age, companies used such simple inventory control techniques
as the “red line” system, where a red line was drawn around the inside of a bin holding
inventory items; when the actual stock declined to the level where the red line showed,
inventory would be reordered. But now computers have taken over, and supply chains
have been established that provide inventory items just before they are needed—the
just-in-time system. For example, consider Trane Corporation, which makes air condi-
tioners and currently uses just-in-time procedures. In the past, Trane produced parts
on a steady basis, stored them as inventory, and had them ready whenever the company
received an order for a batch of air conditioners. However, the company’s inventory
eventually covered an area equal to three football fields, and it still could take as long as
15 days to fill an order. To make matters worse, occasionally some of the necessary com-
ponents simply could not be located; in other instances, the components were located
but found to have been damaged from long storage.
Then Trane adopted a new inventory policy—it began producing components
only after receiving an order and then sending the parts directly from the machines
that make them to the final assembly line. The net effect: Inventories fell nearly 40%
even as sales were increasing by 30%.
Such improvements in inventory management can free up considerable amounts
of cash. For example, suppose a company has sales of $120 million and an inventory
turnover ratio of 3. This means the company has an inventory level of
Inventory ¼ Sales=ðInventory turnover ratioÞ
¼ $120=3 ¼ $40 million
If the company can improve its inventory turnover ratio to 4, then its inventory will fall to
Inventory ¼ $120=4 ¼ $30 million
This $10 million reduction in inventory boosts free cash flow by $10 million.
Chapter 16: Working Capital Management
661

However, there are costs associated with holding too little inventory, and these
costs can be severe. If a business lowers its inventories then it must reorder fre-
quently, which increases ordering costs. Even worse, if stocks become depleted then
firms can miss out on profitable sales and also suffer lost goodwill, which may lead to
lower future sales. Therefore, it is important to have enough inventory on hand to
meet customer demands but not so much as to incur the costs we discussed previ-
ously. Inventory optimization models have been developed, but the best approach—
and the one most firms today are following—is to use supply chain management and
monitor the system closely.14

tory procedures?
A company has $20 million in sales and an inventory turnover ratio of 2.0. If it can
reduce its inventory and improve its inventory turnover ratio to 2.5 with no loss in
sales, by how much will FCF increase? ($2 million)
Supply Chain Management
Herman Miller Inc. manufactures a wide variety of office
furniture, and a typical order from a single customer
might require work at five different plants. Each plant
uses components from different suppliers, and each
plant works on orders for many customers. Imagine all
the coordination that is required. The sales force gener-
ates the order, the purchasing department orders com-
ponents from suppliers, and the suppliers must order
materials from their own suppliers. The suppliers
make and then ship the components to Herman Miller,
the factory builds the products, the different products
are gathered together to complete the order, and then
the order is shipped to the customer. If one part of that
process malfunctions, then the order will be delayed,
inventory will pile up, extra costs to expedite the order
will be incurred, and the customer’s goodwill will be
damaged, hurting future growth.
To prevent such consequences, many companies
employ supply chain management (SCM). The key ele-
ment in SCM is sharing information all the way back
from the retailer where the product is sold, to the com-
pany’s own plant, then back to the firm’s suppliers, and
even back to the suppliers’ suppliers. SCM requires
special computer software, but even more important is
that it requires cooperation among the different compa-
nies and departments in the supply chain. This culture
of open communication is often difficult for many com-
panies, which can be reluctant to divulge operating in-
formation. For example, EMC Corp., a manufacturer of
data storage systems, has become deeply involved in
the design processes and financial controls of its key
suppliers. Many of EMC’s suppliers were initially wary
of these new relationships. However, SCM has been a
win–win proposition, with higher profits for both EMC
and its suppliers.
The same is true at many other companies. After im-
plementing SCM, Herman Miller was able to reduce its
days of inventory on hand by a week and to cut 2 weeks
off of delivery times to customers. It was also able to
operate its plants at a 20% higher volume without addi-
tional capital expenditures, because downtime due to
inventory shortages was virtually eliminated. As an-
other example, Heineken USA can now get beer from
its Dutch breweries to its customers’ shelves in less
than 6 weeks, compared with 10 to 12 weeks before im-
plementing SCM. As these and other companies have
found, SCM increases free cash flows, and that leads
to more profits and higher stock prices.

16.8 RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT
Firms would, in general, rather sell for cash than on credit, but competitive pressures
force most firms to offer credit for substantial purchases, especially to other businesses.
Thus, goods are shipped, inventories are reduced, and an account receivable is cre-
ated.15 Eventually, the customer will pay the account, at which time (1) the firm will re-
ceive cash and (2) its receivables will decline. Carrying receivables has both direct and
indirect costs, but selling on credit also has an important benefit: increased sales.
Receivables management begins with the firm’s credit policy, but a monitoring
system is also important to keep tabs on whether the terms of credit are being ob-
served. Corrective action is often needed, and the only way to know whether the sit-
uation is getting out of hand is with a good receivables control system.16
Credit Policy
The success or failure of a business depends primarily on the demand for its products—
as a rule, high sales lead to larger profits and a higher stock price. Sales, in turn, depend
on a number of factors: some, like the state of the economy, are exogenous, but others
are under the firm’s control. The major controllable factors are sales prices, product
quality, advertising, and the firm’s credit policy. Credit policy, in turn, consists of the
following four variables.
1. Credit period. A firm might sell on terms of “net 30,” which means that the cus-
tomer must pay within 30 days.
2. Discounts. If the credit terms are stated as “2/10, net 30,” then buyers may deduct
2% of the purchase price if payment is made within 10 days; otherwise, the full
amount must be paid within 30 days. Thus, these terms allow a discount to be taken.
3. Credit standards. How much financial strength must a customer show to qualify
for credit? Lower credit standards boost sales, but they also increase bad debts.
4. Collection policy. How tough or lax is a company in attempting to collect slow-
paying accounts? A tough policy may speed up collections, but it might also anger
customers and cause them to take their business elsewhere.
The credit manager is responsible for administering the firm’s credit policy. How-
ever, because of the pervasive importance of credit, the credit policy itself is normally
established by the executive committee, which usually consists of the president plus
the vice presidents of finance, marketing, and production.
The Accumulation of Receivables
The total amount of accounts receivable outstanding at any given time is determined
by two factors: (1) the credit sales per day and (2) the average length of time it takes
to collect cash on accounts receivable:
15Whenever goods are sold on credit, two accounts are created—an asset item entitled accounts receivable
appears on the books of the selling firm, and a liability item called accounts payable appears on the books
of the purchaser. At this point, we are analyzing the transaction from the viewpoint of the seller, so we
are concentrating on the variables under its control (i.e., the receivables). We examine the transaction
from the viewpoint of the purchaser later in this chapter, where we discuss accounts payable as a source
of funds and consider their cost.

Trade Credit,” Financial Management, Autumn 1992, pp. 104–112.

(16-5)
For example, suppose Boston Lumber Company (BLC), a wholesale distributor of
lumber products, opens a warehouse on January 1 and, starting the first day, makes sales
of $1,000 each day. For simplicity, we assume that all sales are on credit and that custo-
mers are given 10 days to pay. At the end of the first day, accounts receivable will be
$1,000; they will rise to $2,000 by the end of the second day; and by January 10, they
will have risen to 10($1,000) = $10,000. On January 11, another $1,000 will be added
to receivables, but payments for sales made on January 1 will be collected and thus will
reduce receivables by $1,000, so total accounts receivable will remain constant at
$10,000. Once the firm’s operations have stabilized, the following situation will exist:
Accounts
receivable ¼ Credit sales
per day
×
Length of
collection period
¼
$1;000
×
10 days
¼ $10;000
If either credit sales or the collection period changes, these changes will be reflected
in the accounts receivable balance.
Monitoring the Receivables Position
Both investors and bank loan officers should pay close attention to accounts receiv-
able, because what you see on a financial statement is not necessarily what you end
up getting. To see why, consider how the accounting system operates. When a credit
sale is made, these events occur: (1) inventories are reduced by the cost of goods sold;
(2) accounts receivable are increased by the sales price; and (3) the difference is re-
ported as a profit, which is adjusted for taxes and then added to the previous retained
earnings balance. If the sale is for cash, then the cash from the sale has actually been
received by the firm and the scenario just described is completely valid. If the sale is
on credit, however, then the firm will not receive the cash from the sale unless and
until the account is collected. Firms have been known to encourage “sales” to weak
customers in order to report high current profits. This could boost the firm’s stock
price—but only for a short time. Eventually, credit losses will lower earnings, at
which time the stock price will fall. This is another example of how differences be-
tween a firm’s stock price and its intrinsic value can arise, and it is something that
security analysts must keep in mind.
An analysis along the lines suggested in the following sections will detect any such
questionable practice, and it will also help a firm’s management learn of problems
that might be arising. Such early detection helps both investors and bankers avoid
losses, and it also helps a firm’s management maximize intrinsic values.
Days Sales Outstanding (DSO).
Suppose Super Sets Inc., a television manufac-
turer, sells 200,000 television sets a year at a price of $198 each. Assume that all sales
are on credit under the terms 2/10, net 30. Finally, assume that 70% of the custo-
mers take the discount and pay on Day 10 and that the other 30% pay on Day 30.17
17Unless otherwise noted, we assume throughout that payments are made either on the last day for taking
discounts or on the last day of the credit period. It would be foolish to pay on (say) the 5th day or on the
20th day if the credit terms were 2/10, net 30.
664
Part 7: Managing Global Operations

Super Sets’s days sales outstanding (DSO), sometimes called the average collection
period (ACP), is 16 days:
DSO ¼ ACP ¼ 0:7ð10 daysÞ þ 0:3ð30 daysÞ ¼ 16 days
Super Sets’s average daily sales (ADS) is $108,493:
ADS ¼ Annual sales
365
¼ ðUnits soldÞðSales priceÞ
365
(16-6)
¼ 200;000ð$198Þ
365
¼ $39;600;000
365
¼ $108;493
Super Sets’s accounts receivable—assuming a constant, uniform rate of sales through-
out the year—will at any point in time be $1,735,888:
Receivables ¼ ðDSOÞ ðADSÞ
(16-7)
¼ ð$108;493Þð16Þ ¼ $1;735;888
Note that DSO, or average collection period, is a measure of the average length of
time it takes the firm’s customers to pay off their credit purchases. Super Sets’s DSO
is 16 days versus an industry average of 25 days, so either Super Sets has a higher
percentage of discount customers or else its credit department is exceptionally good
at ensuring prompt payment.
Supply Chain Finance
In our global economy, companies purchase parts and
materials from suppliers located all over the world. For
small and mid-size suppliers, especially those in less de-
veloped economies, selling to international customers
can lead to cash flow problems. First, many suppliers
have no way of knowing when their invoices have been
approved by their customers. Second, they have no way
of knowing when they will actually receive payment from
their customers. With a 4–5-month lag between the time
an order is received and the time the payment occurs,
many suppliers resort to expensive local financing that
can add as much as 4% to their costs. Even worse, some
suppliers go out of business, which reduces competition
and ultimately leads to higher prices.
Although most companies now work very hard with
their suppliers to improve their supply chain opera-
tions, which is at the heart of supply management, a
recent poll shows that only 13% actively use supply
chain finance (SCF) techniques. However, that figure is
likely to rise in the near future. For example, Big Lots
joined a Web-based service operated by PrimeRevenue
that works like this: First, invoices received by Big Lots
are posted to the system as soon as they are approved.
The supplier doesn’t need specialized software but can
check its invoices using a Web browser. Second, the
supplier has the option of selling the approved invoices
at a discount to financial institutions and banks that
have access to the PrimeRevenue network. A further
advantage to the supplier is that it receives cash within
a day of the invoices’ approval. In addition, the effective
interest rate built into the discounted price is based on
the credit rating of Big Lots, not that of the supplier.
As Big Lots treasurer Jared Poff puts it, this allows
vendors to “compete on their ability to make the prod-
uct and not on their ability to access financing.”

Chapter 16: Working Capital Management

Finally, note that you can derive both the annual sales and the receivables balance
from the firm’s financial statements, so you can calculate DSO as follows:
DSO ¼ Receivables
Sales per day ¼ $1;735;888
$108;493
¼ 16 days
The DSO can also be compared with the firm’s own credit terms. For example,
suppose Super Sets’s DSO had been averaging 35 days. With a 35-day DSO, some
customers obviously are taking more than 30 days to pay their bills. In fact, if many
customers are paying by Day 10 to take advantage of the discount, then the others
must be taking, on average, much longer than 35 days. A way to check this possibility
is to use an aging schedule, as described next.
Aging Schedules.
An aging schedule breaks down a firm’s receivables by age of
account. Table 16-1 shows the December 31, 2009, aging schedules of two televi-
sion manufacturers, Super Sets and Wonder Vision. Both firms offer the same
credit terms, and they have the same total receivables. Super Sets’s aging schedule
indicates that all of its customers pay on time: 70% pay by Day 10 and 30% pay by
Day 30. In contrast, Wonder Vision’s schedule, which is more typical, shows that
many of its customers are not paying on time: 27% of its receivables are more than
30 days old, even though Wonder Vision’s credit terms call for full payment by
Day 30.
Aging schedules cannot be constructed from the type of summary data reported in
financial statements; rather, they must be developed from the firm’s accounts receiv-
able ledger. However, well-run firms have computerized their accounts receivable re-
cords, so it is easy to determine the age of each invoice, to sort electronically by age
categories, and thus to generate an aging schedule.
Management should constantly monitor both the DSO and the aging schedule to
detect any trends, to see how the firm’s collections experience compares with its
credit terms, and to see how effectively the credit department is operating in compar-
ison with other firms in the industry. If the DSO starts to lengthen or the aging
schedule begins to show an increasing percentage of past-due accounts, then the
credit manager should examine why these changes are occurring.
Although increases in the DSO and the aging schedule are warning signs,
this does not necessarily indicate the firm’s credit policy has weakened. If a firm
experiences sharp seasonal variations or if it is growing rapidly, then both the aging

schedule and the DSO may be distorted. To see this point, note that the DSO is cal-
culated as follows:
DSO ¼ Accounts receivable
Annual Sales=365
Receivables at any point in time reflect sales in the past 1 or 2 months, but sales as shown
in the denominator are for the past 12 months. Therefore, a seasonal increase in sales
will increase the numerator more than the denominator and hence will raise the DSO,
even if customers continue to pay just as quickly as before. Similar problems arise with
the aging schedule, because if sales are rising then the percentage in the 0–10-day cate-
gory will be high, and the reverse will occur if sales are falling. Therefore, a change in
either the DSO or the aging schedule should be taken as a signal to investigate further; it
is not necessarily a sign that the firm’s credit policy has weakened.

16.9 ACCRUALS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE
(TRADE CREDIT)
Recall that net operating working capital is equal to operating current assets minus
operating current liabilities. The previous sections discussed the management of op-
erating current assets (cash, inventory, and accounts receivable), and the following
sections discuss the two major types of operating current liabilities: accruals and ac-
counts payable.18
Accruals
Firms generally pay employees on a weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis, so the balance
sheet will typically show some accrued wages. Similarly, the firm’s own estimated in-
come taxes, employment and income taxes withheld from employees, and sales taxes col-
lected are generally paid on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis. Therefore, the balance
sheet will typically show some accrued taxes along with accrued wages.
These accruals can be thought of as short-term, interest-free loans from employ-
ees and taxing authorities, and they increase automatically (that is, spontaneously) as a
firm’s operations expand. However, a firm cannot ordinarily control its accruals: The
timing of wage payments is set by economic forces and industry norms, and tax pay-
ment dates are established by law. Thus, firms generally use all the accruals they can,
but they have little control over the levels of these accounts.
Accounts Payable (Trade Credit)
Firms generally make purchases from other firms on credit, recording the debt as an
account payable. Accounts payable, or trade credit, is the largest single operating

toring Accounts Payables,” Financial Review, November 1990, pp. 559–576.

current liability, representing about 40% of the current liabilities for an average non-
financial corporation. The percentage is somewhat larger for smaller firms: Because
small companies often have difficulty obtaining financing from other sources, they
rely especially heavily on trade credit.
Trade credit is a spontaneous source of financing in the sense that it arises from
ordinary business transactions. For example, suppose a firm makes average purchases
of $2,000 a day on terms of net 30, meaning that it must pay for goods 30 days after
the invoice date. On average, it will owe 30 times $2,000, or $60,000, to its suppliers.
If its sales, and consequently its purchases, were to double, then its accounts payable
would also double, to $120,000. So simply by growing, the firm would spontaneously
generate an additional $60,000 of financing. Similarly, if the terms under which the
firm buys were extended from 30 to 40 days, then its accounts payable would expand
from $60,000 to $80,000 even with no growth in sales. Thus, both expanding
sales and lengthening the credit period generate additional amounts of financing via
trade credit.
The Cost of Trade Credit
Firms that sell on credit have a credit policy that includes their terms of credit. For
example, Microchip Electronics sells on terms of 2/10, net 30: it gives customers a
2% discount if they pay within 10 days of the invoice date, but the full invoice
amount is due and payable within 30 days if the discount is not taken.
The “true price” of Microchip’s products is the net price, or 0.98 times the list
price, because any customer can purchase an item at that price as long as payment
is made within 10 days. Now consider Personal Computer Company (PCC), which
buys its memory chips from Microchip. One chip is listed at $100, so its “true” price
to PCC is $98. Now if PCC wants an additional 20 days of credit beyond the 10-day
discount period, it must incur a finance charge of $2 per chip for that credit. Thus,
the $100 list price consists of two components:
List price ¼ $98 true price þ $2 finance charge
The question PCC must ask before it turns down the discount to obtain the addi-
tional 20 days of credit is this: Could credit be obtained at a lower cost from a bank
or some other lender?
Now assume that PCC buys $11,923,333 of memory chips from Microchip each
year at the net, or true, price. This amounts to $11,923,333/365 = $32,666.67 per
day. For simplicity, assume that Microchip is PCC’s only supplier. If PCC decides
not to take the additional 20 days of trade credit—that is, if it pays on the 10th day
and takes the discount—then its payables will average 10($32,666.67) = $326,667.
Thus, PCC will be receiving $326,667 of credit from Microchip.
Now suppose PCC decides to take the additional 20 days credit and so must pay the
full list price. Since PCC will now pay on the 30th day, its accounts payable will increase
to 30($32,666.67) = $980,000.19 Microchip will now be supplying PCC with an addi-
tional $980,000 −$326,667 = $653,333 of credit, which PCC could use to build up its
cash account, to pay off debt, to expand inventories, or even to extend credit to its own
customers, hence increasing its own accounts receivable.
19A question arises here: Should accounts payable reflect gross purchases or purchases net of discounts?
Generally accepted accounting principles permit either treatment if the difference is not material, but if
the discount is material then the transaction must be recorded net of discounts, or at “true” prices. Then,
the higher payment that results from not taking discounts is reported as an expense called “discounts
lost.” Therefore, we show accounts payable net of discounts even if the company does not expect to take discounts.
668
Part 7: Managing Global Operations

Thus the additional trade credit offered by Microchip has a cost: PCC must pay a
finance charge equal to the 2% discount it is forgoing. PCC buys $11,923,333 of
chips at the true price, so the added finance charge would increase the total cost to
$11,923,333/0.98 = $12,166,666. Therefore, the annual financing cost is $12,166,666
−$11,923,333 = $243,333. Dividing the $243,333 financing cost by the $653,333 of
additional credit, we calculate the nominal annual cost rate of the additional trade
credit to be 37.2%:
Nominal annual costs ¼ $243;333
$653;333 ¼ 37:2%
If PCC can borrow from its bank (or some other source) at an interest rate less
than 37.2%, then it should take the 2% discount and forgo the additional trade
credit.
The following equation can be used to calculate the nominal cost (on an annual
basis) of not taking discounts, illustrated with terms of 2/10, net 30:

(16-8)
¼ 2
98 × 365
20 ¼ 2:04% × 18:25 ¼ 37:2%
The numerator of the first term, Discount percentage, is the cost per dollar of credit,
while the denominator, 100 −Discount percentage, represents the funds made avail-
able by not taking the discount. Thus, the first term, 2.04%, is the cost per period for
the trade credit. The denominator of the second term is the number of days of extra
credit obtained by not taking the discount, so the entire second term shows how
many times each year the cost is incurred—18.25 times in this example.
This nominal annual cost formula does not consider the compounding of interest.
In terms of effective annual interest, the cost of trade credit is even higher:
Effective annual rate ¼ ð1:0204Þ18:25 −1:0 ¼ 1:4459 −1:0 ¼ 44:6%
Thus, the 37.2% nominal cost calculated with Equation 16-8 actually understates the
true cost.
Note, however, that the calculated cost of trade credit can be reduced by paying
late. Thus, if PCC could get away with paying in 60 days rather than the specified 30
days, then the effective credit period would become 60 −10 = 50 days, the number of
times the discount would be lost would fall to 365/50 = 7.3, and the nominal cost
would drop from 37.2% to 2.04% × 7.3 = 14.9%. Then the effective annual rate
would drop from 44.6% to 15.9%:
Effective annual rate ¼ ð1:0204Þ7:3 −1:0 ¼ 1:1589 −1:0 ¼ 15:9%
In periods of excess capacity, firms may be able to get away with deliberately paying
late, or stretching accounts payable. However, they will also suffer a variety of pro-
blems associated with being a “slow payer.” These problems are discussed later in the
chapter.
Chapter 16: Working Capital Management
669

The costs of the additional trade credit from forgoing discounts under some other
purchase terms are taken from the chapter’s Excel Tool Kit model and shown here as
Figure 16-7. As these numbers indicate, the cost of not taking discounts can be
substantial.
On the basis of the preceding discussion, trade credit can be divided into two
components: (1) free trade credit, which involves credit received during the discount
period, and (2) costly trade credit, which involves credit in excess of the free trade
credit and whose cost is an implicit one based on the forgone discounts. Firms should
always use the free component, but they should use the costly component only after analyzing
the cost of this capital to make sure it is less than the cost of funds that could be obtained from
other sources. Under the terms of trade found in most industries, the costly component
is relatively expensive, so stronger firms generally avoid using it.
Note, though, that firms sometimes offer favorable credit terms in order to stimu-
late sales. For example, suppose a firm has been selling on terms of 2/10, net 30, with
a nominal cost of 37.24%, but a recession has reduced sales and the firm now has
excess capacity. It wants to boost the sales of its product without cutting the list price,
so it might offer terms of 1/10, net 90, which implies a nominal cost of additional
credit of only 4.61%. In this situation, its customers would probably be wise to take
the additional credit and reduce their reliance on banks and other lenders. So, turn-
ing down discounts is not always a bad decision.

investments. Of course, it is difficult to separate these two purposes, because securi-
ties held while awaiting reinvestment are available for liquidity purposes.
Marketable securities typically provide much lower yields than operating assets. For
example, in January 2009 Merck held approximately $1.1 billion in short-term market-
able securities in addition to $4.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Two years earlier,
in 2007, it held $2.8 billion of short-term securities plus $5.9 billion of cash and cash
equivalents. Why would Merck hold such a large amount of low-yielding assets?
Consider first the reduction in cash and securities from 2007 to 2009. At the earlier
date, Merck was in the midst of a series of trials over allegations that its drug Vioxx
had caused a number of fatal heart attacks. This case was settled in 2008, so the cash
and securities it had been holding to cover potential losses could be reduced. This
demonstrates one reason why firms sometimes hold what seems to be an excessive
amount of cash and securities. Other reasons include needing to pay off maturing
bonds or paying for plants under construction.
With regard to operating funds, companies typically lump liquid marketable secu-
rities in with currency and bank demand deposits and call the total “cash and cash
equivalents.” These are the current assets that the firm needs to carry in its opera-
tions on an uninterrupted basis. If the company needs to write checks in amounts
greater than its demand deposits, it simply makes a phone call to a broker and places
a market sell order; the broker in turn will sell the securities, and almost immediately
the sale proceeds will be deposited in the firm’s bank account. Because cash and most
commercial checking accounts yield nothing whereas marketable securities provide at
least a modest return, firms choose to hold part of their liquid assets as marketable
securities rather than pure cash balances.
Note also that firms’ cash and equivalents holdings can be reduced by having
unused credit lines with banks. A firm can negotiate a line of credit under which it
can borrow immediately if it needs cash for transactions. It can simply call the bank,
ask to “take down” a portion of its line, and the bank will immediately deposit funds
in its account that can then be used for writing checks.
There are both benefits and costs associated with holding marketable securities.
The benefits are twofold: (1) the firm reduces risk and transaction costs, because it
won’t have to issue securities or borrow as frequently to raise cash; and (2) it will
have ready cash to take advantage of bargain purchases or growth opportunities.
Funds held for the second reason are called speculative balances. The primary
disadvantage is that the after-tax return on short-term securities is very low. Thus,
firms face a trade-off between benefits and costs.
Recent research supports this trade-off hypothesis as an explanation for firms’ cash
holdings.20 Firms with high growth opportunities suffer the most if they don’t have
ready cash to quickly take advantage of an opportunity, and the data show that these
firms do hold relatively high levels of marketable securities. Firms with volatile cash
flows are the ones most likely to run low on cash, so they tend to hold high levels of
cash. In contrast, cash holdings are less important to large firms with high credit ratings,
because they have quick and inexpensive access to capital markets. As expected, such
firms hold relatively low levels of cash. Of course, there will always be outliers such as
Microsoft, which is large, strong, and cash-rich, but volatile firms with good growth
opportunities are still the ones that hold the most marketable securities, on average.

Why might a company hold low-yielding marketable securities when it could earn a
much higher return on operating assets?
16.11 SHORT-TERM FINANCING
The three possible short-term financing policies described earlier in the chapter were
distinguished by the relative amounts of short-term debt used under each policy. The
aggressive policy called for the greatest use of short-term debt, and the conservative policy
called for using the least; maturity matching fell in between. Although short-term credit is
generally riskier than long-term credit, using short-term funds does have some significant
advantages. The pros and cons of short-term financing are considered in this section.
Advantages of Short-Term Financing
First, a short-term loan can be obtained much faster than long-term credit. Lenders will
insist on a more thorough financial examination before extending long-term credit, and
the loan agreement will have to be spelled out in considerable detail because a lot can
happen during the life of a 10- to 20-year loan. Therefore, if funds are needed in a
hurry, the firm should look to the short-term markets.
Second, if its needs for funds are seasonal or cyclical, then a firm may not want to
commit itself to long-term debt. There are three reasons for this: (1) Flotation costs
are higher for long-term debt than for short-term credit. (2) Although long-term debt
can be repaid early (provided the loan agreement includes a prepayment provision),
prepayment penalties can be expensive. Accordingly, if a firm thinks its need for funds
will diminish in the near future, it should choose short-term debt. (3) Long-term loan
agreements always contain provisions, or covenants, that constrain the firm’s future
actions. Short-term credit agreements are generally less restrictive.
The third advantage is that, because the yield curve is normally upward sloping,
interest rates are generally lower on short-term debt. Thus, under normal conditions,
interest costs at the time the funds are obtained will be lower if the firm borrows on a
short-term rather than a long-term basis.
Disadvantages of Short-Term Debt
Even though short-term rates are often lower than long-term rates, using short-term
credit is riskier for two reasons: (1) If a firm borrows on a long-term basis then its
interest costs will be relatively stable over time, but if it uses short-term credit then
its interest expense will fluctuate widely, at times going quite high. For example, the
rate banks charged large corporations for short-term debt more than tripled over a
2-year period in the 1980s, rising from 6.25% to 21%. Many firms that had bor-
rowed heavily on a short-term basis simply could not meet their rising interest costs;
as a result, bankruptcies hit record levels during that period. (2) If a firm borrows
heavily on a short-term basis, a temporary recession may render it unable to repay
this debt. If the borrower is in a weak financial position then the lender may not
extend the loan, which could force the firm into bankruptcy.

term debt?

Part 7: Managing Global Operations

shown on balance sheets because banks provide nonspontaneous funds. As a firm’s
financing needs increase, it requests additional funds from its bank. If the request is
denied, the firm may be forced to abandon attractive growth opportunities. The key
features of bank loans are discussed in the following paragraphs.
Maturity
Although banks do make longer-term loans, the bulk of their lending is on a short-term
basis—about two-thirds of all bank loans mature in a year or less. Bank loans to busi-
nesses are frequently written as 90-day notes, so the loan must be repaid or renewed
at the end of 90 days. Of course, if a borrower’s financial position has deteriorated
then the bank may refuse to renew the loan. This can mean serious trouble for the
borrower.
Promissory Notes
When a bank loan is approved, the agreement is executed by signing a promissory
note. The note specifies (1) the amount borrowed, (2) the interest rate, (3) the repay-
ment schedule, which can call for either a lump sum or a series of installments, (4)
any collateral that might have to be put up as security for the loan, and (5) any other
terms and conditions to which the bank and the borrower have agreed. When the
note is signed, the bank credits the borrower’s checking account with the funds;
hence both cash and notes payable increase on the borrower’s balance sheet.
Compensating Balances
Banks sometimes require borrowers to maintain an average demand deposit (check-
ing account) balance of 10% to 20% of the loan’s face amount. This is called a com-
pensating balance, and such balances raise the effective interest rate on the loans. For
example, if a firm needs $80,000 to pay off outstanding obligations but it must main-
tain a 20% compensating balance, then it must borrow $100,000 to obtain a usable
$80,000. If the stated annual interest rate is 8%, the effective cost is actually 10%:
$8,000 interest divided by $80,000 of usable funds equals 10%.21
As we noted earlier in the chapter, recent surveys indicate that compensating
balances are much less common now than earlier. In fact, compensating balances
are now illegal in many states. Despite this trend, some small banks in states where
compensating balances are legal still require their customers to maintain them.
Informal Line of Credit
A line of credit is an informal agreement between a bank and a borrower indicating
the maximum credit the bank will extend to the borrower. For example, on Decem-
ber 31, a bank loan officer might indicate to a financial manager that the bank re-
gards the firm as being “good” for up to $80,000 during the forthcoming year,
provided the borrower’s financial condition does not deteriorate. If on January 10
the financial manager signs a 90-day promissory note for $15,000, this would be
called “taking down” $15,000 of the total line of credit. This amount would be cred-
ited to the firm’s checking account at the bank, and the firm could borrow additional
amounts up to a total of $80,000 outstanding at any one time.
21Note, however, that the compensating balance may be set as a minimum monthly average, and if the
firm would maintain this average anyway then the compensating balance requirement would not raise the
effective interest rate. Also, note that these loan compensating balances are added to any compensating
balances that the firm’s bank may require for services performed, such as clearing checks.
Chapter 16: Working Capital Management
673

Revolving Credit Agreement
A revolving credit agreement is a formal line of credit often used by large firms. To
illustrate, suppose in 2010 Texas Petroleum Company negotiated a revolving credit
agreement for $100 million with a group of banks. The banks were formally committed
for 4 years to lend the firm up to $100 million if the funds were needed. Texas Petro-
leum, in turn, paid an annual commitment fee of 0.25% on the unused balance of the
commitment to compensate the banks for making the commitment. Thus, if Texas
Petroleum did not take down any of the $100 million commitment during a year, it
would still be required to pay a $250,000 annual fee, normally in monthly installments
of $20,833.33. If it borrowed $50 million on the first day of the agreement, then the
unused portion of the line of credit would fall to $50 million and the annual fee would
fall to $125,000. Of course, interest would also have to be paid on the money Texas
Petroleum actually borrowed. As a general rule, the interest rate on “revolvers” is
pegged to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the T-bill rate, or some other
market rate, so the cost of the loan varies over time as interest rates change. The inter-
est that Texas Petroleum must pay was set at the prime lending rate plus 1.0%.
Observe that a revolving credit agreement is similar to an informal line of credit
but has an important difference: The bank has a legal obligation to honor a revolving
credit agreement, and it receives a commitment fee. Neither the legal obligation nor
the fee exists under the informal line of credit.
Often a line of credit will have a cleanup clause that requires the borrower to
reduce the loan balance to zero at least once a year. Keep in mind that a line of credit
typically is designed to help finance seasonal or cyclical peaks in operations, not as a
source of permanent capital. For example, our cash budget for Educational Products
Corporation showed negative flows from July through September but positive flows
from October through December. Also, the cumulative net cash flow goes positive in
November, indicating that the firm could pay off its loan at that time. If the cumula-
tive flows were always negative, this would indicate that the firm was using its credit
lines as a permanent source of financing.
Costs of Bank Loans
The costs of bank loans vary for different types of borrowers at any given point in
time and for all borrowers over time. Interest rates are higher for riskier borrowers,
and rates are also higher on smaller loans because of the fixed costs involved in mak-
ing and servicing loans. If a firm can qualify as a “prime credit” because of its size
and financial strength, it can borrow at the prime rate, which at one time was the
lowest rate banks charged. Rates on other loans are generally scaled up from the
prime rate. Loans to large, strong customers are made at rates tied to LIBOR; and
the costs of such loans are generally well below prime:
Rates on June 28, 2009
Prime
3.25%
1-Year LIBOR
1.520%
The rate to smaller, riskier borrowers is generally stated something like “prime
plus 1.0%”; but for a larger borrower it is generally stated as something like “LIBOR
plus 1.5%.”
Bank rates vary widely over time depending on economic conditions and Federal
Reserve policy. When the economy is weak, loan demand is usually slack, inflation is
674
Part 7: Managing Global Operations

low, and the Fed makes plenty of money available to the system. As a result, rates on
all types of loans are relatively low. Conversely, when the economy is booming, loan
demand is typically strong, the Fed restricts the money supply to fight inflation, and
the result is high interest rates. As an indication of the kinds of fluctuations that can
occur, the prime rate during 1980 rose from 11% to 21% in just four months; during
1994, it rose from 6% to 9%.
Calculating Banks’ Interest Charges: Regular (or “Simple”) Interest.
Banks
calculate interest in several different ways. In this section we explain the procedure
used for most business loans. For illustration purposes, we assume a loan of $10,000
at the prime rate, currently 3.25%, with a 360-day year. Interest must be paid
monthly, and the principal is payable “on demand” if and when the bank wants to
end the loan. Such a loan is called a regular (or simple) interest loan.
We begin by dividing the nominal interest rate (3.25% in this case) by 360 to obtain
the rate per day. This rate is expressed as a decimal fraction, not as a percentage:
Simple interest rate per day ¼ Nominal rate
Days in year
¼ 0:0325=360 ¼ 0:000090278
To find the monthly interest payment, the daily rate is multiplied by the amount of
the loan, then by the number of days during the payment period. For our illustrative
loan, the daily interest charge would be $0.902777778, and the total for a 30-day
month would be $27.08:
Interest charge for month ¼ ðRate per dayÞðAmount of loanÞðDays in monthÞ
¼ ð0:000090278Þð$10;000Þð30 daysÞ ¼ $27:08
The effective interest rate on a loan depends on how frequently interest must be paid—
the more frequently interest is paid, the higher the effective rate. If interest is paid once
per year, then the nominal rate is also the effective rate. However, if interest must be
paid monthly, then the effective rate is (1 + 0.0325/12)12 −1 = 3.2989%.
Calculating Banks’ Interest Charges: Add-on Interest.
Banks and other len-
ders typically use add-on interest for automobiles and other types of installment
loans. The term add-on means that the interest is calculated and then added to the
amount borrowed to determine the loan’s face value. To illustrate, suppose you bor-
row $10,000 on an add-on basis at a nominal rate of 7.25% to buy a car, with the
loan to be repaid in 12 monthly installments. At a 7.25% add-on rate, you would
make total interest payments of $10,000(0.0725) = $725. However, since the loan is
paid off in monthly installments, you would have the use of the full $10,000 for only
the first month; then the outstanding balance would decline until, during the last
month, only 1/12 of the original loan was still outstanding. Thus, you would be pay-
ing $725 for the use of only about half the loan’s face amount, since the average us-
able funds would be only about $5,000. Therefore, we can calculate the approximate
annual rate as 14.5%:

The annual percentage rate (APR) the bank would provide to the borrower would be
13.12%, and the true effective annual rate would be 13.94%.22 Both of these rates are
much higher than the nominal 7.25%.

firms and sold primarily to other business firms, to insurance companies, to pension

proximately $1.4 trillion of commercial paper outstanding, versus nearly $1.5 trillion
of commercial and industrial bank loans. Most, but not all, commercial paper out-
standing is issued by financial institutions.
Maturity and Cost
Maturities of commercial paper generally vary from 1 day to 9 months, with an aver-
age of about 5 months.23 The interest rate on commercial paper fluctuates with sup-
ply and demand conditions—it is determined in the marketplace, varying daily as
conditions change. Recently, commercial paper rates have ranged from 1.5 to 3.5
percentage points below the stated prime rate and up to half of a percentage point
above the T-bill rate. For example, in March 2009, the average rate on 3-month
commercial paper was 0.60%, the prime rate was 3.25%, and the 3-month T-bill
rate was 0.22%.
Use of Commercial Paper
The use of commercial paper is restricted to a comparatively small number of very
large concerns that are exceptionally good credit risks. Dealers prefer to handle the

−893.75, and FV = 0; then press I/YR to obtain 1.093585%. This is a monthly rate, so multiply by 12 to
get 13.12%, which is the APR the bank would report to the borrower. The effective annual rate would
then be (1.010936) −1 = 13.94%, quite a bit above the APR.

paper of firms whose net worth is $100 million or more and whose annual borrowing
exceeds $10 million. One potential problem with commercial paper is that a debtor
who is in temporary financial difficulty may receive little help because commercial
paper dealings are generally less personal than are bank relationships. Thus, banks
are generally more able and willing to help a good customer weather a temporary
storm than is a commercial paper dealer. On the other hand, using commercial paper
permits a corporation to tap a wide range of credit sources, including financial insti-
tutions outside its own area and industrial corporations across the country, and this
can reduce interest costs.

16.14 USE OF SECURITY IN SHORT-TERM FINANCING
Thus far, we have not addressed the question of whether or not short-term loans
should be secured. Commercial paper is never secured, but other types of loans can
be secured if this is deemed necessary or desirable. Other things held constant, it is
better to borrow on an unsecured basis, since the bookkeeping costs of secured
loans are often high. However, firms often find that they can borrow only if they
put up some type of collateral to protect the lender or that, by using security, they
can borrow at a much lower rate.
Several different kinds of collateral can be employed, including marketable stocks
or bonds, land or buildings, equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable. Market-
able securities make excellent collateral, but few firms that need loans also hold port-
folios of stocks and bonds. Similarly, real property (land and buildings) and
equipment are good forms of collateral, but they are generally used as security for
long-term loans rather than for working capital loans. Therefore, most secured
short-term business borrowing involves the use of accounts receivable and invento-
ries as collateral.
To understand the use of security, consider the case of a Chicago hardware dealer
who wanted to modernize and expand his store. He requested a $200,000 bank loan.
After examining the business’s financial statements, his bank indicated that it would
lend him a maximum of $100,000 and that the effective interest rate would be 9%.
The owner had a substantial personal portfolio of stocks, and he offered to put up
$300,000 of high-quality stocks to support the $200,000 loan. The bank then granted
the full $200,000 loan at the prime rate of 3.25%. The store owner might also have
used his inventories or receivables as security for the loan, but processing costs would
have been high.24

What is a secured loan?
What are some types of current assets that are pledged as security for short-term
loans?
24The term “asset-based financing” is often used as a synonym for “secured financing.” In recent years,
accounts receivable have been used as security for long-term bonds, permitting corporations to borrow
from lenders such as pension funds rather than just from banks and other traditional short-term lenders.

Chapter 16: Working Capital Management
677

Summary
This chapter discussed working capital management and short-term financing. The
key concepts covered are listed below.
•
Working capital refers to current assets used in operations, and net working
capital is defined as current assets minus all current liabilities. Net operating
working capital is defined as operating current assets minus operating current
liabilities.
•
Under a relaxed working capital policy, a firm would hold relatively large
amounts of each type of current asset. Under a restricted working capital
policy, the firm would hold minimal amounts of these items.
•
A moderate approach to short-term financing involves matching, to the extent
possible, the maturities of assets and liabilities, so that temporary current oper-
ating assets are financed with short-term debt and permanent current operating
assets and fixed assets are financed with long-term debt or equity. Under an
aggressive approach, some permanent current operating assets, and perhaps
even some fixed assets, are financed with short-term debt. A conservative
approach would be to use long-term sources to finance all permanent operating
capital and some of the temporary current operating assets.
•
Permanent current operating assets are the operating current assets the firm
holds even during slack times, whereas temporary current operating assets are
the additional operating current assets needed during seasonal or cyclical peaks.
The methods used to finance permanent and temporary current operating assets
define the firm’s short-term financing policy.
•
The inventory conversion period is the average time required to convert
materials into finished goods and then to sell those goods:
Inventory conversion period ¼ Inventory ÷ Cost of goods sold per day
•
The average collection period is the average length of time required to convert
the firm’s receivables into cash—that is, to collect cash following a sale:
Average collection period ¼ DSO ¼ Receivables ÷ ðSales=365Þ
•
The payables deferral period is the average length of time between the pur-
chase of materials and labor and the payment of cash for them:
Payables deferral period ¼ Payables ÷ Cost of goods sold per day
•
The cash conversion cycle (CCC) is the length of time between the firm’s
actual cash expenditures to pay for productive resources (materials and labor) and
its own cash receipts from the sale of products (that is, the length of time be-
tween paying for labor and materials and collecting on receivables):

•
A cash budget is a schedule showing projected cash inflows and outflows over
some period. The cash budget is used to predict cash surpluses and deficits, and
it is the primary cash management planning tool.
•
The primary goal of cash management is to minimize the amount of cash the
firm must hold for conducting its normal business activities while at the same
678
Part 7: Managing Global Operations

time maintaining a sufficient cash reserve to take discounts, pay bills promptly,
and meet any unexpected cash needs.
•
The transactions balance is the cash necessary to conduct routine day-to-day
business; precautionary balances are cash reserves held to meet random, un-
foreseen needs. A compensating balance is a minimum checking account bal-
ance that a bank requires as compensation either for services provided or as part
of a loan agreement.
•
The twin goals of inventory management are (1) to ensure that the inventories
needed to sustain operations are available, but (2) to hold the costs of ordering
and carrying inventories to the lowest possible level.
•
When a firm sells goods to a customer on credit, an account receivable is
created.
•
A firm can use an aging schedule and the days sales outstanding (DSO) to
monitor its receivables balance and to help avoid an increase in bad debts.
•
A firm’s credit policy consists of four elements: (1) credit period, (2) discounts
given for early payment, (3) credit standards, and (4) collection policy.
•
Accounts payable, or trade credit, arises spontaneously as a result of credit
purchases. Firms should use all the free trade credit they can obtain, but they
should use costly trade credit only if it is less expensive than other forms of
short-term debt. Suppliers often offer discounts to customers who pay within a
stated period. The following equation may be used to calculate the nominal cost,
on an annual basis, of not taking such discounts:
Nominal annual cost
of trade credit
¼ Discount percentage
100 −Discount
percentage
×

Days credit is

period
•
The advantages of short-term credit are (1) the speed with which short-term
loans can be arranged, (2) increased flexibility, and (3) generally lower interest
rates than with long-term credit. The principal disadvantage of short-term credit
is the extra risk the borrower must bear because (1) the lender can demand
payment on short notice, and (2) the cost of the loan will increase if interest
rates rise.
•
Bank loans are an important source of short-term credit. When a bank loan is
approved, a promissory note is signed. It specifies: (1) the amount borrowed, (2)
the percentage interest rate, (3) the repayment schedule, (4) the collateral, and
(5) any other conditions to which the parties have agreed.
•
Banks sometimes require borrowers to maintain compensating balances, which
are deposit requirements set at between 10% and 20% of the loan amount.
Compensating balances raise the effective interest rate on bank loans.
•
A line of credit is an informal agreement between the bank and the borrower
indicating the maximum amount of credit the bank will extend to the borrower.
•
A revolving credit agreement is a formal line of credit often used by large
firms; it involves a commitment fee.
•
A simple interest loan is one in which interest must be paid monthly and the
principal is payable “on demand” if and when the bank wants to end the loan.
•
An add-on interest loan is one in which interest is calculated and added to the
funds received to determine the face amount of the installment loan.
•
Commercial paper is unsecured short-term debt issued by large, financially
strong corporations. Although the cost of commercial paper is lower than the
cost of bank loans, it can be used only by large firms with exceptionally strong
credit ratings.
Chapter 16: Working Capital Management
679

•
Sometimes a borrower will find it is necessary to borrow on a secured basis, in
which case the borrower pledges assets such as real estate, securities, equipment,
inventories, or accounts receivable as collateral for the loan. For a more detailed
discussion of secured financing, see Web Extension 16A.

Flow Cycle
The Christie Corporation is trying to determine the effect of its inventory turnover
ratio and days sales outstanding (DSO) on its cash flow cycle. Christie’s sales last year
(all on credit) were $150,000, and it earned a net profit of 6%, or $9,000. It turned
over its inventory 7.5 times during the year, and its DSO was 36.5 days. Its annual
cost of goods sold was $121,667. The firm had fixed assets totaling $35,000. Chris-
tie’s payables deferral period is 40 days.
a. Calculate Christie’s cash conversion cycle.
b. Assuming Christie holds negligible amounts of cash and marketable securities,
calculate its total assets turnover and ROA.
c. Suppose Christie’s managers believe the annual inventory turnover can be raised
to 9 times without affecting sales. What would Christie’s cash conversion cycle,
total assets turnover, and ROA have been if the inventory turnover had been 9
for the year?

Working Capital Policy
The Rentz Corporation is attempting to determine the optimal level of current assets
for the coming year. Management expects sales to increase to approximately $2 mil-
lion as a result of an asset expansion presently being undertaken. Fixed assets total $1
million, and the firm wishes to maintain a 60% debt ratio. Rentz’s interest cost is
currently 8% on both short-term and longer-term debt (both of which the firm
uses in its permanent capital structure). Three alternatives regarding the projected
current asset level are available to the firm: (1) a tight policy requiring current assets
of only 45% of projected sales, (2) a moderate policy of 50% of sales in current as-
sets, and (3) a relaxed policy requiring current assets of 60% of sales. The firm ex-
pects to generate earnings before interest and taxes at a rate of 12% on total sales.
a. What is the expected return on equity under each current asset level? (Assume a
40% effective federal-plus-state tax rate.)
b. In this problem, we have assumed that the level of expected sales is independent
of current asset policy. Is this a valid assumption?

Cash Budgeting
Dorothy Koehl recently leased space in the Southside Mall and opened a new busi-
ness, Koehl’s Doll Shop. Business has been good, but Koehl has frequently run out
of cash. This has necessitated late payment on certain orders, which is beginning to
cause a problem with suppliers. Koehl plans to borrow from the bank to have cash
ready as needed, but first she needs a forecast of just how much she should borrow.
Accordingly, she has asked you to prepare a cash budget for the critical period
around Christmas, when needs will be especially high.
Sales are made on a cash basis only. Koehl’s purchases must be paid for during the fol-
lowing month. Koehl pays herself a salary of $4,800 per month, and the rent is $2,000 per
month. In addition, she must make a tax payment of $12,000 in December. The current
cash on hand (on December 1) is $400, but Koehl has agreed to maintain an average
bank balance of $6,000—this is her target cash balance. (Disregard cash in the till, which
is insignificant because Koehl keeps only a small amount on hand in order to lessen the
chances of robbery.)

Cash Discounts
Suppose a firm makes purchases of $3.65 million per year under terms of 2/10, net
30, and takes discounts.
a. What is the average amount of accounts payable net of discounts? (Assume the
$3.65 million of purchases is net of discounts—that is, gross purchases are
$3,724,489.80, discounts are $74,489.80, and net purchases are $3.65 million.)
b. Is there a cost of the trade credit the firm uses?
c. If the firm did not take discounts but did pay on the due date, what would be its
average payables and the cost of this nonfree trade credit?
d. What would be the firm’s cost of not taking discounts if it could stretch its pay-
ments to 40 days?
(16–16)
Trade Credit
The Thompson Corporation projects an increase in sales from $1.5 million to $2
million, but it needs an additional $300,000 of current assets to support this expan-
sion. Thompson can finance the expansion by no longer taking discounts, thus in-
creasing accounts payable. Thompson purchases under terms of 2/10, net 30, but it
can delay payment for an additional 35 days—paying in 65 days and thus becoming
35 days past due—without a penalty because its suppliers currently have excess capac-
ity. What is the effective, or equivalent, annual cost of the trade credit?
(16–17)
Bank Financing
The Raattama Corporation had sales of $3.5 million last year, and it earned a 5%
return (after taxes) on sales. Recently, the company has fallen behind in its accounts
payable. Although its terms of purchase are net 30 days, its accounts payable repre-
sent 60 days’ purchases. The company’s treasurer is seeking to increase bank
borrowings in order to become current in meeting its trade obligations (that is, to
have 30 days’ payables outstanding). The company’s balance sheet is as follows (in

Estimates obtained from the credit and collection department are as follows: collections
within the month of sale, 10%; collections during the month following the sale, 75%; col-
lections the second month following the sale, 15%. Payments for labor and raw materials
are typically made during the month following the one in which these costs were incurred.
Total costs for labor and raw materials are estimated for each month as shown in the table.
General and administrative salaries will amount to approximately $27,000 a month;
lease payments under long-term lease contracts will be $9,000 a month; depreciation
charges will be $36,000 a month; miscellaneous expenses will be $2,700 a month; income
tax payments of $63,000 will be due in both September and December; and a progress
payment of $180,000 on a new design studio must be paid in October. Cash on hand on
July 1 will amount to $132,000, and a minimum cash balance of $90,000 will be main-
tained throughout the cash budget period.
a. Prepare a monthly cash budget for the last 6 months of 2011.
b. Prepare an estimate of the required financing (or excess funds)—that is, the
amount of money Bowers will need to borrow (or will have available to invest)—
for each month during that period.

c. Assume that receipts from sales come in uniformly during the month (i.e., cash
receipts come in at the rate of 1/30 each day) but that all outflows are paid on
the 5th of the month. Will this have an effect on the cash budget—in other
words, would the cash budget you have prepared be valid under these assump-
tions? If not, what can be done to make a valid estimate of peak financing re-
quirements? No calculations are required, although calculations can be used to
illustrate the effects.
d. Bowers produces on a seasonal basis, just ahead of sales. Without making any
calculations, discuss how the company’s current ratio and debt ratio would vary
during the year assuming all financial requirements were met by short-term bank
loans. Could changes in these ratios affect the firm’s ability to obtain bank
credit?
e. If its customers began to pay late, this would slow down collections and thus in-
crease the required loan amount. Also, if sales dropped off, this would have an
effect on the required loan amount. Perform a sensitivity analysis that shows
the effects of these two factors on the maximum loan requirement.
Mini Case
Dan Barnes, financial manager of Ski Equipment Inc. (SKI), is excited but apprehensive. The
company’s founder recently sold his 51% controlling block of stock to Kent Koren, who is a
big fan of EVA (Economic Value Added). EVA is found by taking the net operating profit af-
ter taxes (NOPAT) and then subtracting the dollar cost of all the capital the firm uses:
EVA ¼ NOPAT −Capital costs
¼ EBITð1 −TÞ −WACCðTotal capital employedÞ
If EVA is positive then the firm’s management is creating value. On the other hand, if EVA
is negative, then the firm is not covering its cost of capital and stockholders’ value is being
eroded. Koren rewards managers handsomely if they create value, but those whose operations
produce negative EVAs are soon looking for work. Koren frequently points out that if a com-
pany could generate its current level of sales with fewer assets, it would need less capital. This
would, other things held constant, lower capital costs and increase its EVA.
Shortly after taking control of SKI, Kent Koren met with SKI’s senior executives to tell
them of his plans for the company. First, he presented some EVA data that convinced every-
one that SKI had not been creating value in recent years. He then stated, in no uncertain
terms, that this situation must change. He noted that SKI’s designs of skis, boots, and clothing
are acclaimed throughout the industry but claimed that something was seriously amiss else-
where in the company. Costs are too high, prices are too low, or the company employs too
much capital, and Koren wants SKI’s managers to correct the problem—or else.
Barnes has long felt that SKI’s working capital situation should be studied. The company
may have the optimal amounts of cash, securities, receivables, and inventories, but it may also
have too much or too little of these items. In the past, the production manager resisted
Barnes’s efforts to question his holdings of raw materials, the marketing manager resisted
questions about finished goods, the sales staff resisted questions about credit policy (which
affects accounts receivable), and the treasurer did not want to talk about her cash and securi-
ties balances. Koren’s speech made it clear that such resistance would no longer be tolerated.
Barnes also knows that decisions about working capital cannot be made in a vacuum. For
example, if inventories could be lowered without adversely affecting operations, then less capi-
tal would be required, the dollar cost of capital would decline, and EVA would increase. How-
ever, lower raw materials inventories might lead to production slowdowns and higher costs,
and lower finished goods inventories might lead to the loss of profitable sales. So, before in-
ventories are changed, it will be necessary to study operating as well as financial effects. The
situation is the same with regard to cash and receivables. Barnes begins by collecting the ratios
shown below. (The partial cash budget shown after the ratios is used later in this mini case.)

a. Barnes plans to use the preceding ratios as the starting point for discussions with
SKI’s operating executives. He wants everyone to think about the pros and cons
of changing each type of current asset and how changes would interact to affect
profits and EVA. Based on the data, does SKI seem to be following a relaxed,
moderate, or restricted working capital policy?
b. How can one distinguish between a relaxed but rational working capital policy
and a situation in which a firm simply has excessive current assets because it is
inefficient? Does SKI’s working capital policy seem appropriate?
c. Calculate the firm’s cash conversion cycle given that annual sales are $660,000
and cost of goods sold represents 90% of sales. Assume a 365-day year.
d. What might SKI do to reduce its cash without harming operations? In an
attempt to better understand SKI’s cash position, Barnes developed a cash bud-
get. Data for the first 2 months of the year are shown above. (Note that Barnes’s
preliminary cash budget does not account for interest income or interest
expense.) He has the figures for the other months, but they are not shown.
e. Should depreciation expense be explicitly included in the cash budget? Why or why not?
f. In his preliminary cash budget, Barnes has assumed that all sales are collected
and thus that SKI has no bad debts. Is this realistic? If not, how would bad debts
be dealt with in a cash budgeting sense? (Hint: Bad debts will affect collections
but not purchases.)
g. Barnes’s cash budget for the entire year, although not given here, is based heavily
on his forecast for monthly sales. Sales are expected to be extremely low between
May and September but then to increase dramatically in the fall and winter. No-
vember is typically the firm’s best month, when SKI ships equipment to retailers
for the holiday season. Barnes’s forecasted cash budget indicates that the com-
pany’s cash holdings will exceed the targeted cash balance every month except
for October and November, when shipments will be high but collections will
not be coming in until later. Based on the ratios shown earlier, does it appear
that SKI’s target cash balance is appropriate? In addition to possibly lowering
the target cash balance, what actions might SKI take to better improve its cash
management policies, and how might that affect its EVA?
h. What reasons might SKI have for maintaining a relatively high amount of cash?
i. Is there any reason to think that SKI may be holding too much inventory? If so,
how would that affect EVA and ROE?
j. If the company reduces its inventory without adversely affecting sales, what effect
should this have on the company’s cash position (1) in the short run and (2) in
the long run? Explain in terms of the cash budget and the balance sheet.
k. Barnes knows that SKI sells on the same credit terms as other firms in its industry.
Use the ratios presented earlier to explain whether SKI’s customers pay more or
less promptly than those of its competitors. If there are differences, does that sug-
gest SKI should tighten or loosen its credit policy? What four variables make up a
firm’s credit policy, and in what direction should each be changed by SKI?
l. Does SKI face any risks if it tightens its credit policy?
m. If the company reduces its DSO without seriously affecting sales, what effect
would this have on its cash position (1) in the short run and (2) in the long run?
Answer in terms of the cash budget and the balance sheet. What effect should
this have on EVA in the long run?
In addition to improving the management of its current assets, SKI is also reviewing
the ways in which it finances its current assets. With this concern in mind, Barnes is
also trying to answer the following questions.
688
Part 7: Managing Global Operations

n. Is it likely that SKI could make significantly greater use of accruals?
o. Assume that SKI purchases $200,000 (net of discounts) of materials on terms of
1/10, net 30, but that it can get away with paying on the 40th day if it chooses
not to take discounts. How much free trade credit can the company get from its
equipment supplier, how much costly trade credit can it get, and what is the
nominal annual interest rate of the costly credit? Should SKI take discounts?
p. SKI tries to match the maturity of its assets and liabilities. Describe how SKI
could adopt either a more aggressive or a more conservative financing policy.
q. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using short-term debt as a source
of financing?
r. Would it be feasible for SKI to finance with commercial paper?

he United States has had plenty of company in the global economic crisis.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 2008 was a terrible year
globally. World output (measured by real GDP) averaged 4% growth per year
from 1999 to 2007 but grew by only 3.2% in 2008. Most of the 2008 growth
was due to the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), which averaged
almost 7% growth. In contrast, the U.S. economy grew by only 1.1% in 2008.
But as bad as 2008 was, the IMF predicted a much worse 2009: the world’s
real GDP was forecast to fall by 1.3%, making this the first year since World War II
to exhibit worldwide contraction. The IMF predicts positive growth in 2009 for
some countries (including Qatar, China, and India), but 78 of 182 countries it
tracks are predicted to have declines in real GDP, including the following:
Country
2009 (Predicted)
Change in Real GDP
United States
−2.8%
Germany
−5.6
Japan
−6.2
Brazil
−1.3
Russia
−6.0
Botswana
−10.4
Iceland
−10.6
Latvia
−12.0
The IMF predicts that it will be 2011 before the world economy returns to its 2008
level and that the United States won’t make up its lost ground until 2012.
According to the United Nations, corporations retrenched by cutting their
foreign direct investments (such as factories, warehouses, and retail operations in
foreign countries) by 54% in the first quarter of 2009. Cross-border mergers and
acquisitions dropped by a whopping 77% in the same period.
Is this retrenching short-sighted? Foreign operations are risky, but that is
where the IMF predicts the most economic growth. As you read this chapter,
think about the risks and rewards of international business ventures.

Managers of multinational companies must deal with a wide range of issues that
are not present when a company operates in a single country. In this chapter, we high-
light the key differences between multinational and domestic corporations, and we dis-
cuss the effects these differences have on the financial management of multinational
businesses.
17.1 MULTINATIONAL, OR GLOBAL, CORPORATIONS
The terms multinational corporations, transnational corporations, and global
corporations are used to describe firms that operate in an integrated fashion in a
number of countries. Rather than merely buying resources from and selling goods
to foreign nations, multinational firms often make direct investments in fully inte-
grated operations, from extraction of raw materials, through the manufacturing pro-
cess, and to distribution to consumers throughout the world. Today, multinational
corporate networks control a large and growing share of the world’s technological,
marketing, and productive resources.
Companies “go global” for many reasons, including the following.
1. To broaden their markets. After a company has saturated its home market, growth
opportunities are often better in foreign markets. Thus, such homegrown firms as
Coca-Cola and McDonald’s are aggressively expanding into overseas markets,
Corporate Valuation in a Global Context
The intrinsic value of a firm is determined by the size,
timing, and risk of its expected future free cash flows
(FCF). This is true for foreign as well as domestic opera-
tions, but the FCF of a foreign operation is affected by
exchange rates, cultural differences, and the host coun-
try’s regulatory environment. In addition, global finan-
cial markets and political risk can affect the cost of
capital.

and foreign firms such as Sony and Toshiba now dominate the U.S. consumer
electronics market.
2. To seek raw materials. Many U.S. oil companies, such as ExxonMobil, have major
subsidiaries around the world to ensure access to the basic resources needed to
sustain the companies’ primary business lines.
3. To seek new technology. No single nation holds a commanding advantage in all tech-
nologies, so companies scour the globe for leading scientific and design ideas. For
example, Xerox has introduced more than 80 different office copiers in the United
States that were engineered and built by its Japanese joint venture, Fuji Xerox.
4. To seek production efficiency. Companies in high-cost countries are shifting pro-
duction to low-cost regions. For example, GE has production and assembly
plants in Mexico, South Korea, and Singapore; Japanese manufacturers are shift-
ing some of their production to lower-cost countries in the Pacific Rim.
5. To avoid political and regulatory hurdles. For example, when Germany’s BASF
launched biotechnology research at home, it confronted legal and political chal-
lenges from the environmentally conscious Green movement. In response, BASF
shifted its cancer and immune system research to two laboratories in the Boston
suburbs. This location is attractive not only because of its large number of engi-
neers and scientists but also because the Boston area has resolved many contro-
versies involving safety, animal rights, and the environment.
6. To diversify. By establishing worldwide production facilities and markets, firms
can cushion the impact of adverse economic trends in any single country. In
general, geographic diversification helps because the economic ups and downs of
different countries are not perfectly correlated.

17.2 MULTINATIONAL VERSUS DOMESTIC FINANCIAL
MANAGEMENT
In theory, the concepts and procedures discussed in earlier chapters are valid for both
domestic and multinational operations. However, six major factors distinguish finan-
cial management in firms operating entirely within a single country from that of
firms operating globally.
1. Different currency denominations. Cash flows in various parts of a multinational
corporate system will be denominated in different currencies. Hence, the effects
of exchange rates must be addressed in all financial analyses.
2. Economic and legal ramifications. Each country has its own unique economic and
legal systems, and these differences can cause significant problems when a cor-
poration tries to coordinate and control its worldwide operations. For example,
differences in tax laws among countries can cause a given economic transaction to
have strikingly different after-tax consequences, depending on where the transaction
occurs. Similarly, differences in legal systems of host nations, such as the Common
Law of Great Britain versus the French Civil Law, complicate matters ranging from
the simple recording of business transactions to the role played by the judiciary in
resolving conflicts. Such differences can restrict multinational corporations’ flexibil-
ity in deploying resources and can even make procedures that are required in one
part of the company illegal in another part. These differences also make it difficult
for executives trained in one country to move easily to another.

3. Language differences. The ability to communicate is critical in all business transac-
tions, and here U.S. citizens are often at a disadvantage because they are gener-
ally fluent only in English, whereas European and Japanese businesspeople are
usually fluent in several languages, including English.
4. Cultural differences. Even within geographic regions that are considered relatively
homogeneous, different countries have unique cultural heritages that shape values
and influence the conduct of business. Multinational corporations find that mat-
ters such as defining the appropriate goals of the firm, attitudes toward risk,
dealings with employees, and the ability to curtail unprofitable operations vary
dramatically from one country to the next.
5. Role of governments. In a foreign country, the terms under which companies com-
pete, the actions that must be taken or avoided, and the terms of trade on various
transactions often are determined not in the marketplace but by direct negotia-
tion between host governments and multinational corporations.
6. Political risk. A nation might place constraints on the transfer of corporate re-
sources or even expropriate assets within its boundaries. This is political risk, and
it varies from country to country. Another aspect of political risk is terrorism
against U.S. firms or executives. For example, U.S. and Japanese executives are at
risk of being kidnapped in Mexico and several South American countries.
These factors complicate financial management, and they increase the risks faced by
multinational firms. However, the prospects for high returns and better diversifica-
tion make it worthwhile for firms to accept these risks and learn how to manage
them.
Self-Test
Identify and briefly discuss six major factors that complicate financial management
in multinational firms.
17.3 EXCHANGE RATES
An exchange rate specifies the number of units of a given currency that can be pur-
chased with one unit of another currency. Exchange rates appear daily in the financial
sections of newspapers, such as The Wall Street Journal, and on financial Web sites,
such as http://www.bloomberg.com. The values shown in Column 1 of Table 17-1
are the number of U.S. dollars required to purchase one unit of a foreign currency; this
is called a direct quotation. Direct quotations have a dollar sign in their quotation and
state the number of dollars per foreign currency unit, such as dollars per euro. Thus, the
direct U.S. dollar quotation for the euro is $1.3276, because one euro could be bought
for 1.3276 dollars.
The exchange rates given in Column 2 represent the number of units of a foreign
currency that can be purchased for one U.S. dollar; these are called indirect quota-
tions. Indirect quotations often begin with the foreign currency’s equivalent to the
dollar sign and express the foreign currency per dollar, such as euros per dollar.
Thus, the indirect quotation for the euro is €0.7532. (The “€” stands for euro, and it
is analogous to the symbol “$.”)
Normal practice in currency trading centers is to use the indirect quotations (Col-
umn 2) for all currencies other than British pounds and euros, for which the direct
quotations are given. Thus, we speak of the pound as “selling at 1.4915 dollars, or at
$1.4915,” and the euro as “selling at $1.3276.” For all other currencies, the normal
convention is to use indirect quotations. For example, for the Japanese yen, we would
quote the dollar as “being at ¥98.8600,” where the “¥” stands for yen. This conven-

tion eliminates confusion when comparing quotations from one trading center—say,
New York—with those from another—say, London or Zurich.
We can use the data in Table 17-1 to show how to work with exchange rates. Sup-
pose a tourist flies from New York to London, then to Paris, and then on to Geneva.
She then flies to Montreal, and finally back to New York. Her tour includes lodging,
food, and transportation, but she must pay for any other expenses. When she arrives
at London’s Heathrow Airport, she goes to the bank to check the foreign exchange
listings. The rate she observes for U.S. dollars is $1.4915, which means that £1 will
cost $1.4915. Assume that she exchanges $3,000. How many pounds will she get?
Pounds ¼
Dollars
Dollars=pound
¼
$3; 000
$1:4915 per pound ¼ £2; 011:40
She then enjoys a week’s vacation in London, ending with £1,000.
After taking a train under the Channel to France, she realizes that she needs to
exchange her 1,000 remaining pounds for euros. However, what she sees on the
board is the direct quotation for dollars per pound and the direct quotation for dol-
lars per euro. The exchange rate between any two currencies other than dollars is
called a cross rate. Cross rates are actually calculated on the basis of various curren-
cies relative to the U.S. dollar. For example, the cross rate between British pounds
and euros is computed as follows:
Cross rate of euros per pound ¼ Dollars=Pound
Dollars=Euro ¼ Euros
Pound
¼ $1:4915 per pound
$1:3276 per euro ¼ 1:1235 euros per pound
She would receive 1.1235 euros for every British pound, so she would receive
1,123.50 euros = (1.1235 euros/pound)(1,000 pounds).

She has 800 euros remaining when she finishes touring in France and arrives in
Geneva. She again needs to determine a cross rate, this time between euros and Swiss
francs. The quotes she sees, as shown in Table 17-1, are a direct quote for euros
($1.3276 per euro) and an indirect quote for Swiss francs (SFr 1.1370 per dollar).
To find the cross rate for Swiss francs per euro, she makes the following calculation:
Cross rate of Swiss francs per euro ¼
Swiss francs
Dollar

 Dollars
Euro


¼ ðSFr 1:1370 per dollarÞð$1:3276 per euroÞ
¼ 1:5095 Swiss francs per euro
Therefore, for every euro she would receive 1.5095 Swiss francs, so she would re-
ceive 1,207.60 Swiss francs = (1.5095 Swiss francs per euro)(800 euros).
She has 500 Swiss francs remaining when she leaves Geneva and arrives in Mon-
treal. She again needs to determine a cross rate, this time between Swiss francs and
Canadian dollars. The quotes she sees, as shown in Table 17-1, are an indirect quote
for Swiss francs (SFr 1.1370 per dollar) and an indirect quote for Canadian dollars
(1.2139 Canadian dollars per U.S. dollar). To find the cross rate for Canadian dollars
per Swiss franc, she makes the following calculation:
Cross rate of Canadian dollars
per Swiss franc
¼
Canadian dollars
U:S: dollar


Swiss francs
U:S: dollar


¼ 1:2139 Canadian dollars per U:S: dollar
SFr 1:1370 per U:S: dollar
¼ 1:0676 Canadian dollars per Swiss franc
Therefore, she would receive 533.80 Canadian dollars = (1.0676 Canadian dollars per
Swiss franc)(500 Swiss francs).
After leaving Montreal and arriving at New York, she has 100 Canadian dollars
remaining. She sees the indirect quote for Canadian dollars and converts the 100 Ca-
nadian dollars to U.S. dollars as follows:
100 Canadian dollars ¼
100 Canadian dollars
1:2139 Canadian dollars per U:S: dollar ¼ $82:38
In this example, we made three assumptions. First, we assumed that our traveler
had to calculate all of the cross rates. For retail transactions, it is customary to display
the cross rates directly instead of a series of dollar rates. Second, we assumed that
exchange rates remain constant over time. Actually, exchange rates vary every day,
often dramatically. We will have more to say about exchange rate fluctuations in the
next section. Finally, we assumed that there were no transaction costs involved in ex-
changing currencies. In reality, small retail exchange transactions such as those in our
example usually involve fixed and/or sliding-scale fees that can easily consume 5% or
more of the transaction amount. However, credit card purchases minimize these fees.

1. Column 1 gives indirect quotes for dollars—that is, units of a foreign currency
that can be bought with one U.S. dollar. Examples: $1 will buy 0.7532 euro or
1.1370 Swiss francs. This is consistent with Table 17-1, Column 2.
2. Other columns show number of units of other currencies that can be bought
with one pound, one Swiss franc, etc. For example, the euro column shows
that 1 euro will buy 1.6116 Canadian dollars, 131.2465 Japanese yen, or
1.3276 U.S. dollars.
3. The rows show direct quotes—that is, the number of units of the currency of the
country listed in the left column required to buy one unit of the currency listed
in the top row. The bottom row is particularly important for U.S. companies, as
it shows the direct quotes for the U.S. dollar. This row is consistent with Col-
umn 1 of Table 17-1.
4. Observe that the values on the bottom row of Table 17-2 are reciprocals of the
corresponding values in the first column. For example, the U.K. row in the first
column shows 0.6705 pound per dollar, and the pound column in the bottom row
shows 1/0.6705 = 1.4915 dollars per pound.
5. By reading down the euro column, you can see that 1 euro is worth 1.5095 Swiss
francs. This is the same cross rate that we calculated for the U.S. tourist in our
example.
The tie-in with the dollar ensures that all currencies are related to one another
in a consistent manner—if this consistency did not exist, then currency traders
could profit by buying undervalued and selling overvalued currencies. This pro-
cess, known as arbitrage, works to bring about an equilibrium wherein the same
relationship described earlier exists. Currency traders are constantly operating in
the market, seeking small inconsistencies from which they can profit. The tra-
ders’ existence enables the rest of us to assume that currency markets are in
equilibrium and that, at any moment in time, cross rates are all internally
consistent.1

17.4 EXCHANGE RATES AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE
Just as the demand for consumer goods such as Tommy Hilfiger clothing and Nike
shoes changes over time, so does the demand for currency. One factor affecting cur-
rency demand is the balance of trade between two countries. For example, U.S. im-
porters must buy yen to pay for Japanese goods, whereas Japanese importers must
buy U.S. dollars to pay for U.S. goods. If U.S. imports from Japan were to exceed
U.S. exports to Japan, then the U.S. would have a trade deficit with Japan, and there
would be a greater demand for yen than for dollars. Capital movements also affect
currency demand. For example, suppose interest rates in the United States were
higher than those in Japan. To take advantage of high U.S. interest rates, Japanese
banks, corporations, and sophisticated individuals would buy dollars with yen and
then use those dollars to purchase high-yielding U.S. securities. This would create
greater demand for dollars than for yen.
Without any government intervention, the relative prices of yen and dollars would
fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand in much the same way that
prices of consumer goods fluctuate. For example, if U.S. consumers were to increase
their demand for Japanese electronic products, then the accompanying increase in
demand for the yen would cause its value to increase relative to the dollar. In this
situation, the strong yen would be due to fundamental economic forces.
However, governments can and do intervene. A country’s central bank can artifi-
cially prop up its currency by using its reserves of gold or foreign currencies to pur-
chase its own currency in the open market. This creates artificial demand for its own
currency, thus causing its value to be artificially high. A central bank can also keep its
currency at an artificially low value by selling its own currency in the open markets.
This increases the currency’s supply, which reduces its price.
Why might an artificially low currency be a problem? After all, a cheap currency
makes it less expensive for other nations to purchase the country’s goods, which cre-
ates jobs in the exporting country. However, an artificially low currency value raises
the cost of imports, which increases inflation. In addition, high import prices allow
competing domestic manufacturers to raise their prices as well, further boosting in-
flation. The government intervention that causes the artificially low value also contri-
butes to inflation: When a government creates currency to sell in the open markets,
this increases the money supply, and, all else held constant, an increasing money sup-
ply leads to still more inflation. Thus, artificially holding down the value of a currency
stimulates exports but at the expense of potentially overheating and inflating the econ-
omy. Also, other countries—whose economies are being weakened because their man-
ufacturers cannot compete against the artificially low prices—may retaliate and impose
tariffs or other restrictions on the country that is holding its currency value down.
For example, China had for many years artificially held down the value of the
yuan (also called the rinminbi). This helped make China the world’s largest exporter
and greatly stimulated its economy. However, by 2004 the Chinese economy was
698
Part 7: Managing Global Operations

growing at an unsustainably high rate, and inflation was rising rapidly. The United
States and other nations began urging the Chinese government to allow the yuan to
rise, which would help their economies by slowing Chinese exports and stimulating
their own exports to China. On July 21, 2005, the Chinese government suddenly an-
nounced that it was changing the exchange rate to allow the yuan’s value to rise by
2.1%. The Chinese government has continued to allow the yuan to appreciate
slowly, and it now (June 2009) stands at about 0.1466 dollars/yuan versus 0.1217 dol-
lars/yuan in June 2005. Notice that this change has made it somewhat cheaper for
Chinese to buy from America (a yuan now buys more dollars) and more expensive
for Americans to buy from China.
A currency that is artificially high has the opposite effects: Inflation will be held
down and citizens can purchase imported goods at low domestic prices, but exporting
industries are hurt, as are domestic industries that compete with the cheap imports.
Because there is relatively little external demand for the currency, the government
will have to create demand by purchasing its own currency, paying with either gold
or foreign currencies held by its central bank. Over time, supporting an inflated cur-
rency can deplete the gold and foreign currency reserves, making it impossible to
continue propping up the currency.
The following sections describe ways that governments handle changes in cur-
rency demands.

17.5 THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM
AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICIES
Every nation has a monetary system and a monetary authority. In the United States,
the Federal Reserve is our monetary authority, and its task is to hold down inflation
while promoting economic growth and raising our national standard of living. More-
over, if countries are to trade with one another, we must have some sort of system
designed to facilitate payments between nations. The international monetary system
is the framework within which exchange rates are determined. As we describe in this
section, there are several different policies used by various countries to determine ex-
change rates.2
A Short History Lesson: The Bretton Woods
Fixed Exchange Rate System
From the end of World War II until August 1971, most of the industrialized world
operated under the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system administered by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). Under this system, the U.S. dollar was linked to
gold (at $35 per ounce), and other currencies were then tied to the dollar. The
United States took actions to keep the price of gold at $35 per ounce, and central

banks acted to keep exchange rates between other currencies and the dollar within
narrow limits. For example, when the demand for pounds was falling, the Bank of
England would step in and buy pounds to push up their price, offering gold or for-
eign currencies in exchange for pounds. Conversely, when the demand for pounds
was too high, the Bank of England would sell pounds for dollars or gold. The Fed-
eral Reserve in the United States performed the same functions, and central banks of
other countries operated similarly. These actions artificially matched supply and de-
mand, keeping exchange rates stable, but they didn’t address the underlying imbal-
ance. For example, if the high demand for pounds occurred because British
productivity was rising and British goods were improving in quality, then the under-
lying demand for pounds would continue in spite of central bank intervention. In
such a situation, the Bank of England would find it necessary to continually sell
pounds. If the central bank stopped selling pounds then their value would rise; that
is, the pound would strengthen and exceed the agreed-upon limits.
Many countries found it difficult and economically painful to maintain the fixed
exchange rates required by Bretton Woods. This system began to crumble in August
1971, and it was abandoned completely by the end of 1973. The following sections
describe several modern exchange rate systems.
Freely, or Independently, Floating Rates
In the early 1970s, the U.S. dollar was cut loose from the gold standard and, in effect,
allowed to “float” in response to supply and demand caused by international trade
and international investing activities. According to the International Monetary
Fund, about 42 countries currently operate under a system of floating exchange
rates, whereby currency prices are allowed to seek their own levels, with only modest
central bank intervention to smooth out extreme exchange rate fluctuations. The
IMF reports that about 31 currencies have freely, or independently, floating ex-
change rates; these currencies include the dollar, euro, pound, and yen.
Currency Appreciation and Depreciation.
Suppose the dollar cost of a pound is
$1.4915, as shown in Table 17-1. If there were increased demand for pounds caused
by a U.S. trade deficit with Great Britain, then the price of pounds might increase to
$2.5. In this situation the pound is said to be appreciating, because a pound would
now buy more dollars. In other words, a pound would now be worth more than it
previously was. This is called currency appreciation. Conversely, the dollar would
be depreciating because the dollar now buys fewer pounds (a dollar would previously
buy 1/1.4915 = 0.6705 pounds, but afterward it would buy only 1/2.5 = 0.4 pounds).
This is called currency depreciation. Notice that the more costly pound would
make British imports more expensive to U.S. consumers, which would reduce
imports—and, consequently, the demand for pounds—until the exchange rate
reached equilibrium.
Exchange Rate Risk.
Exchange rate fluctuations can have a profound effect on
profits and trade. For example, in 2002 the euro exchange rate was about $0.87 (i.e.,
0.87 dollars per euro). In 2009, the exchange rate was about $1.33. Consider the im-
pact this has on profits and trade. For example, a hand-blown glass from the Italian
island of Murano cost about €50 in 2002. Ignoring shipping costs and taxes, a con-
sumer in the United States could have purchased this glass for €50($0.87/€) = $43.50.
Assuming the price in 2009 still was €50, it would cost €50($1.33/€) = $57.86. Thus,
the change in exchange rates obviously hurt Italian exports to the United States.
700
Part 7: Managing Global Operations

On the other hand, U.S. vintners were able to export wines to Italy much more
profitably in 2009 than in 2002. For example, suppose a bottle of Pinot Noir cost a
California vineyard $10 to produce in 2002 but could be sold for €17 in Europe. In
2002, the profit would have been €17($0.87/€) −$10 = $14.79 −$10 = $4.79. Assum-
ing no change in production costs, the bottle’s profit in 2009 is €17($1.33/€) −$10 =
$22.61 −$10 = $12.61. Thus, U.S. exporters to Europe have benefited by the change
in exchange rates.
The volatility of exchange rates under a floating system increases the uncertainty
of the cash flows for a multinational corporation. Because its cash flows are generated
in many parts of the world, they are denominated in many different currencies.
When exchange rates change, the dollar-equivalent value of the company’s consoli-
dated cash flows also fluctuates. This is known as exchange rate risk, and it is a ma-
jor factor differentiating a global company from a purely domestic one.
Managed Floating Rates
In a managed floating rate system, there is significant government intervention to
manage the exchange rate by manipulating the currency’s supply and demand. The
government rarely reveals its target exchange rate levels if it uses a managed float re-
gime because this would make it too easy for currency speculators to profit. Accord-
ing to the IMF, about 53 countries have a managed floating rate system, including
Colombia, India, Singapore, and Burundi.
Pegged Exchange Rates
In a pegged exchange rates system, a country locks, or “pegs,” its currency’s ex-
change rate to another currency or basket of currencies. It is common for a country
with a pegged exchange rate to allow its currency to vary within specified limits or
bands (often set at ±1% of the target rate) before the country intervenes to force
the currency back within the limits. Examples in which a currency is pegged to an-
other country’s currency include Bhutan’s ngultrum, which is pegged to the Indian
rupee; the Falkland Islands’ pound, which is pegged to the British pound; and Barba-
dos’s dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. An example of a currency being
pegged to a basket is China, where the yuan is no longer just pegged to the U.S. dol-
lar but rather to a basket of currencies. The Chinese government will not reveal ex-
actly which currencies make up the basket, but the U.S. dollar, the euro, the yen, and
the South Korean won are certainly components.
Currency Devaluation and Revaluation.
As indicated previously, countries
with pegged exchange rates establish a fixed exchange rate with some other major
currency or basket of currencies. When a government reduces its target fixed ex-
change rate, the result is a currency devaluation; increasing the rate results in a cur-
rency revaluation. For example, from 1991 through early 2002, Argentina had a
fixed exchange rate of 1 peso per U.S. dollar. Imports were high, exports were low,
and the Argentinean government had to purchase huge amounts of pesos to maintain
that artificially high exchange rate. The government borrowed heavily to finance
these purchases, and eventually it was unable to continue supporting the peso. (In-
deed, the government defaulted on some of its obligations.) As a result, the govern-
ment had to devalue the peso to 1.4 pesos per dollar in early 2002. Notice that this
made the peso weaker: Before the devaluation, 1 peso would buy 1 dollar, but after-
ward 1 peso would buy only 71 cents (1.4 pesos per dollar = 1/1.4 = 0.71 dollar per
peso). The devaluation lowered the prices of Argentine goods on the world market,
which helped its exporters, but prices rose for imported goods, including oil. The
Chapter 17: Multinational Financial Management
701

initial shock to the Argentine economy was severe, as employment fell in those indus-
tries that were not exporters. The problem was exacerbated because many Argentine
companies and individuals had incurred debt that was denominated in dollars, which
instantly cost much more to service. However, the economy gradually improved, aided
by increased exports, tourism, and employment rates. Still, the initial pain caused by
devaluation helps explain why many countries with fixed exchange rates tend to post-
pone needed measures until economic pressures build to explosive levels.
Given the expense of maintaining an artificially high exchange rate and the pain of
large devaluations, many countries that once had pegged exchange rates now allow
their currencies to float. For example, Mexico had a pegged exchange rate prior to
1994, but it depleted its foreign reserves trying to support the peso and was forced
to devalue it. Mexico’s currency now floats, as does that of Argentina.
Convertible versus Nonconvertible Securities.
A pegged exchange rate isn’t
necessarily a deterrent to direct investment in the country by foreign corporations—
as long as the local government’s central bank supports the currency and devaluations
are unlikely. This was generally the case in the Bretton Woods era, so those curren-
cies were considered to be convertible because the nation that issued them allowed
them to be traded in the currency markets and was willing to redeem them at market
rates. This is true today for all floating-rate currencies, which are also called hard
currencies because of their convertibility. Some pegged currencies are also at least
partially convertible, because their central banks will redeem them at market rates
under specified conditions.
However, some countries set the exchange rate but do not allow their currencies
to be traded on world markets. For example, the Chinese yuan is allowed to float in a
very narrow band against a basket of securities. However, the yuan can be legally
used and exchanged only within China. Furthermore, the Chinese government im-
poses restrictions on both residents and nonresidents from freely converting their
holdings of yuans into another currency. Thus, the yuan is a nonconvertible cur-
rency, also called a soft currency. When official exchange rates differ from “market
rates” or when there are restrictions on convertibility, a black market will often arise.
For example, in mid-2008 Venezuela’s official exchange rate was about 2.15 bolivars
per dollar, but black market prices were estimated to be around 3.25.
A nonconvertible currency creates problems for foreign companies looking to make
direct investments. Consider the situation faced by Pizza Hut when it wanted to open a
chain of restaurants in the former Soviet Union. The Russian ruble was not convertible,
so Pizza Hut could not take the profits from its restaurants out of the Soviet Union in
the form of dollars. Because there was no mechanism to exchange the rubles it earned in
Russia for dollars, it seemed that investing in the Soviet Union was essentially worthless
to a U.S. company. However, Pizza Hut arranged to use the ruble profit from the res-
taurants to buy Russian vodka, which it then shipped to the United States and sold for
dollars. Pizza Hut managed to find a solution, but lack of convertibility significantly in-
hibits the ability of a country to attract foreign investment.
No Local Currency
A few countries don’t have their own separate legal tender but instead use the cur-
rency of another nation. For example, Ecuador has used the U.S. dollar since Sep-
tember 2000. Other countries belong to a monetary union, such as the 16 European
Monetary Union nations in 2009 whose currency is the euro, which is allowed to
float. In contrast, member nations of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union, the
West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), and the Central African
702
Part 7: Managing Global Operations

Economic and Monetary Community (CAEMC) use their respective union’s cur-
rency, which is itself pegged to some other currency. For example, the Eastern Ca-
ribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, and the CFA franc (used by both the
WAEMU and CAEMC) is pegged to the euro.3

17.6 TRADING IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE
Importers, exporters, tourists, and governments buy and sell currencies in the foreign
exchange market. For example, when a U.S. trader imports automobiles from Japan,
payment will probably be made in Japanese yen. The importer buys yen (through its
bank) in the foreign exchange market, much as one buys common stocks on the New
York Stock Exchange or pork bellies on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. However,
whereas stock and commodity exchanges have organized trading floors, the foreign
exchange market consists of a network of brokers and banks based in New York,
London, Tokyo, and other financial centers. Most buy and sell orders are conducted
by computer and telephone.
Spot Rates and Forward Rates
The exchange rates shown in Tables 17-1 and 17-2 are known as spot rates, which
means the rate paid for delivery of the currency “on the spot” or, in reality, no more
than two days after the day of the trade. For most of the world’s major currencies, it
is also possible to buy (or sell) currencies for delivery at some agreed-upon future
date, usually 30, 90, or 180 days from the day the transaction is negotiated. This
rate is known as the forward exchange rate.
For example, suppose that a U.S. firm must pay 500 million yen to a Japanese firm
in 30 days and that the current spot rate is 98.8600 yen per dollar. If spot rates re-
main constant, then the U.S. firm will pay the Japanese firm the equivalent of $5.058
million (500 million yen divided by 98.8600 yen per dollar) in 30 days. But if the spot
rate falls to, say, 90 yen per dollar, then the U.S. firm will have to pay the equivalent
of $5/(90 ¥/$) = $5.56 million. If the spot rate increases to 109, the firm will pay only
$5/(109 ¥/$) = $4.587 million. The treasurer of the U.S. firm can avoid this variabil-
ity by entering into a 30-day forward exchange contract. Suppose this contract pro-
mises delivery of yen to the U.S. firm in 30 days at a guaranteed price of 98.8100 yen
per dollar. No cash changes hands at the time the treasurer signs the forward con-
tract, although the U.S. firm might have to put some collateral down as a guarantee
against default. Yet because the firm can use an interest-bearing instrument for the
collateral, this requirement is not costly. The counterparty to the forward contract
must deliver the yen to the U.S. firm in 30 days, and the U.S. firm is obligated to
purchase the 500 million yen at the previously agreed-upon rate of 98.8100 yen per
dollar. Therefore, the treasurer of the U.S. firm is able to lock in a payment
3A few countries, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, have currency board arrangements. Under this system,
a country technically has its own currency but commits to exchange it for a specified foreign money unit
at a fixed exchange rate. This requires it to impose domestic currency restrictions unless it has the foreign
currency reserves to cover requested exchanges.

equivalent to $5.060 million = (¥500 million)/(98.8100 ¥/$), no matter what happens
to spot rates. This technique is called hedging.
Forward rates for 30-, 90-, and 180-day delivery, along with the current spot rates
for some commonly traded currencies, are given in Table 17-3. If you can obtain
more of the foreign currency for a dollar in the forward than in the spot market,
then the forward currency is less valuable than the spot currency and the forward
currency is said to be selling at a discount. In other words, if the foreign currency
is expected to depreciate (based on the forward rates), then the forward currency is
at a discount. Conversely, since a dollar would buy fewer yen and francs in the for-
ward than in the spot market, the forward yen and francs are selling at a premium.

Explain what it means for a forward currency to sell at a discount and at a

17.7 INTEREST RATE PARITY
Market forces determine whether a currency sells at a forward premium or a dis-
count, and the general relationship between spot and forward exchange rates is spec-
ified by a concept called “interest rate parity.”
Interest rate parity means that investors should expect to earn the same return on
security investments in all countries after adjusting for risk. It recognizes that when you in-
vest in a country other than your home country, you are affected by two forces—returns on
the investment itself and changes in the exchange rate. It follows that your overall return
will be higher than the investment’s stated return if the currency in which your investment
is denominated appreciates relative to your home currency. Likewise, your overall return
will be lower if the foreign currency that you receive declines in value.
To illustrate interest rate parity, consider the case of a U.S. investor who can buy
default-free 180-day Swiss bonds that promise a 4% nominal annual return. The

180-day foreign (Swiss) interest rate, rf, is 4% ÷ 2 = 2% because 180 days is one-half
of a 360-day year. Assume also that the indirect quotation for the spot exchange rate
is 1.1370 Swiss francs per dollar, as shown in Table 17-3. Finally, assume that the
180-day forward exchange rate is 1.1331 Swiss francs per dollar, which means that
in 180 days the investor can exchange 1 dollar for 1.1331 Swiss francs.
The U.S. investor could receive a 4% annualized return denominated in Swiss
francs, but if he ultimately wants to consume goods in the United States, then those
Swiss francs must be converted to dollars. The dollar return on the investment
depends, therefore, on what happens to exchange rates over the next 6 months. How-
ever, the investor can lock in the dollar return by selling the foreign currency in the
forward market. For example, the investor could simultaneously do the following:
1. Convert $1,000 to 1,137.00 Swiss francs in the spot market: $1,000(1.1370 Swiss
francs per dollar) = 1,137.00 Swiss francs.
2. Invest the Swiss francs in a 180-day Swiss bond that has a 4% annual return, or a
2% semiannual return. This investment will pay 1,137.00(1.02) = 1,159.74 Swiss
francs in 180 days.
3. Agree today to exchange the Swiss francs in 180 days at the forward rate of
1.1331 Swiss francs per dollar, for a total of (1,159.74 Swiss francs) ÷ (1.1331
Swiss francs per dollar) = $1,023.51.
Hence this investment has an expected 180-day return in dollars of $23.51/$1,000
= 2.351%, which translates into a nominal annual return of 2(2.351%) = 4.702%. In
this case, 4% of the expected 4.702% is coming from the bond itself while 0.702%
arises because the market believes that the Swiss franc will strengthen relative to the
dollar. Observe that, by locking in the forward rate today, the investor has eliminated
all exchange rate risk. And since the Swiss bond is assumed to be default-free, the
investor is certain to earn a 4.702% annual dollar return.
Interest rate parity implies that an investment in the United States with the same
risk as the Swiss bond should also have a return of 4.702%. When we express interest
rates as periodic rates, we can express interest rate parity by the following equation
(later in the chapter we will use a slightly different version of interest rate parity
when we consider multi-year cash flows):
Forward exchange rate
Spot exchange rate
¼ 1 þ rh
1 þ rf
(17-1)
Here rh is the periodic interest rate in the home country, rf is the periodic interest
rate in the foreign country, and the forward and exchange rates are expressed as di-
rect quotations (that is, dollars per foreign currency).
Using Table 17-3, the direct spot quotation is 0.87951 dollar per Swiss franc =
(1/1.1370 Swiss francs per dollar), and the direct 180-day forward quotation is 0.88253 =
(1/1.1331). Using Equation 17-1, we can solve for the equivalent home rate, rh:
Forward exchange rate
Spot exchange rate
¼ 1 þ rh
1 þ rf
¼ 1 þ rh
1 þ 0:02 ¼ 0:88253
0:87951
1 þ rh ¼
0:88253
0:87951

The periodic home interest rate is 2.3502%, and the annualized home interest rate is
(2.3502%)(2) = 4.700%, the same value we found before excepting a slight difference
due to rounding.
After accounting for exchange rates, interest rate parity states that bonds in the
home country and the foreign country must have the same actual rate of return in
the investor’s currency. In this example, the U.S. bond must yield 4.700% to provide
the same return as the 4% Swiss bond. If one bond provides a higher return, then
investors will sell their low-return bond and flock to the high-return bond. This ac-
tivity will cause the price of the low-return bond to fall (which pushes up its yield)
and the price of the high-return bond to increase (driving down its yield). These ef-
fects will continue until the two bonds again have the same returns after accounting
for exchange rates.
In other words, interest rate parity implies that an investment in the United
States with the same risk as a Swiss bond should have a dollar value return of
4.700%. Solving for rh in Equation 17-1, we indeed find that the predicted interest
rate in the United States is 4.702%, the same return except for the slight rounding
difference.
Interest rate parity shows why a particular currency might be at a forward
premium or discount. Note that a currency is at a forward premium whenever
domestic interest rates are higher than foreign interest rates. Discounts prevail if
domestic interest rates are lower than foreign interest rates. If these conditions
do not hold, then arbitrage will soon force interest rates and exchange rates
back to parity.
Self-Test
What is interest rate parity?
Assume that interest rate parity holds. When a currency trades at a forward pre-
mium, what does that imply about domestic rates relative to foreign interest rates?
What does it imply when a currency trades at a forward discount?
Assume that 90-day U.S. securities have a 4.5% annualized interest rate whereas
90-day Swiss securities have a 5% annualized interest rate. In the spot market, 1 U.S.
dollar can be exchanged for 1.2 Swiss francs. If interest rate parity holds, what is the
90-day forward rate exchange between U.S. and Swiss francs? (0.8323 $/SFr or
1.2015 SFr/$)
On the basis of your answer to the previous question, is the Swiss franc selling at a
premium or discount on the forward rate? (Discount)
17.8 PURCHASING POWER PARITY
We have discussed exchange rates in some detail, and we have considered the rela-
tionship between spot and forward exchange rates. However, we have not yet ad-
dressed the fundamental question: What determines the spot level of exchange rates
in each country? Although exchange rates are influenced by a multitude of factors
that are difficult to predict, particularly on a day-to-day basis, market forces over
the long run work to ensure that similar goods sell for similar prices in different
countries after taking exchange rates into account. This relationship is known as
“purchasing power parity.”
Purchasing power parity (PPP), sometimes referred to as the law of one price, im-
plies that the levels of exchange rates and prices adjust so as to cause identical goods
to cost the same amount in different countries. For instance, if a pair of tennis shoes
costs $150 in the United States and 100 pounds in Britain, then PPP implies that the
706
Part 7: Managing Global Operations

exchange rate must be $1.50 per pound. Consumers could purchase the shoes in Brit-
ain for 100 pounds, or they could exchange their 100 pounds for $150 and then pur-
chase the same shoes in the United States at the same effective cost (assuming no
transaction or transportation costs). Here is the equation for purchasing power
parity:
Ph = (Pf)(Spot rate)
(17-2)
or
Spot rate ¼ Ph
Pf
(17-3)
Here
Ph ¼ The price of the good in the home country ð$150 in our example;
assuming the United States is the home countryÞ:
Pf ¼ The price of the good in the foreign country ð100 poundsÞ:
Note that the spot market exchange rate is expressed as the number of units of
home currency that can be exchanged for one unit of foreign currency ($1.50 per
pound).
Purchasing power parity assumes that market forces will eliminate situations in
which the same product sells at a different price overseas. For example, if the
shoes cost $140 in the United States then importers/exporters could purchase
them in the United States for $140, sell them for 100 pounds in Britain, exchange
the 100 pounds for $150 in the foreign exchange market, and earn a profit of $10
on every pair of shoes. Ultimately, this trading activity would increase the
demand for shoes in the United States and thus raise Ph, increase the supply of
shoes in Britain and thus reduce Pf, and increase the demand for dollars in the
foreign exchange market and thus reduce the spot rate. Each of these actions
works to restore PPP.
Note that PPP assumes that there are no transportation or transaction costs and
no import restrictions, all of which limit the ability to ship goods between countries.
In many cases, these assumptions are incorrect, which explains why PPP is often vio-
lated. An additional problem for empirical tests of the PPP theorem is that products
in different countries are rarely identical. There are frequently real or perceived dif-
ferences in quality that can lead to price differences in different countries.
Still, the concepts of interest rate parity and purchasing power parity are vitally
important to those engaged in international activities. Companies and investors
must anticipate changes in interest rates, inflation, and exchange rates, and they often
try to hedge the risks of adverse movements in these factors. The parity relationships
are extremely useful when anticipating future conditions.
Self-Test
What is meant by purchasing power parity?
A computer sells for $1,500 U.S. dollars. In the spot market, $1 = 115 Japanese yen.
If purchasing power parity holds, what should be the price (in yen) of the same
computer in Japan? (¥172,500)
Chapter 17: Multinational Financial Management
707

Hungry for a Big Mac? Go To Malaysia!
Purchasing power parity (PPP) implies that the same
product will sell for the same price in every country af-
ter adjusting for current exchange rates. One problem
when testing to see if PPP holds is that it assumes that
goods consumed in different countries are of the same
quality. For example, if you find that a product is more
expensive in Switzerland than it is in Canada, one ex-
planation is that PPP fails to hold, but another explana-
tion is that the product sold in Switzerland is of a higher
quality and therefore deserves a higher price.
One way to test for PPP is to find goods that have
the same quality worldwide. With this in mind, The
Economist magazine occasionally compares the prices
of a well-known good whose quality is the same in
nearly 120 different countries: the McDonald’s Big Mac
hamburger.
The accompanying table provides information col-
lected during early 2009. The second column shows
the price of a Big Mac in local currency. For example,
a Big Mac costs 62 rubles in Russia. The second column
shows the cost in dollars (based on the actual exchange
rate in the fourth column), which is the amount you
would pay in that country if you exchanged dollars for
local currency and then purchased a Big Mac at the lo-
cal price. For example, the exchange rate is 35.7 rubles
per dollar, which means that a Big Mac in Russia costs
$1.73 = (62 rubles) ÷ (35.7 rubles per dollar), subject to
rounding in the exchange rate used by The Economist.
The third column backs out the implied exchange
rate that would hold under PPP. For example, the 62-
ruble price of a Big Mac in Russia compared to the
$3.54 price in the United States gives us the implied
PPP exchange rate of (62 rubles per Big Mac) ÷ ($3.54
per Big Mac) = 17.5 rubles per dollar. The last column
shows how much the local currency is overvalued or
undervalued relative to the dollar. The ruble is underva-
lued by 51%: (17.5 −35.7)/35.7 = −0.51.
The evidence suggests that strict PPP does not hold,
but the Big Mac test may shed some insights about
where exchange rates are headed. Most European cur-
rencies are overvalued against the dollar, while most
other currencies are undervalued. The Big Mac 2009
test suggests that European currencies will fall over
the next year or so but that most others will rise.
One last benefit of the Big Mac test is that it tells us
the cheapest places to find a Big Mac. According to the
data, if you are looking for a Big Mac, head to Malaysia
and avoid Switzerland.

17.9 INFLATION, INTEREST RATES, AND EXCHANGE RATES
Relative inflation rates, or the rates of inflation in foreign countries compared with
that in the home country, have many implications for multinational financial deci-
sions. Obviously, relative inflation rates will greatly influence future production costs
at home and abroad. Equally important, inflation has a dominant influence on rela-
tive interest rates and exchange rates. Both of these factors influence decisions by
multinational corporations for financing their foreign investments, and both have an
important effect on the profitability of foreign investments.
The currencies of countries with higher inflation rates than that of the United States
will by definition depreciate over time against the dollar. Countries where this has
occurred include Mexico and all the South American nations. On the other hand, the
currencies of Switzerland and Japan, which have had less inflation than the United
States, have generally appreciated against the dollar. In fact, a foreign currency will, on aver-
age, depreciate or appreciate against the U.S. dollar at a percentage rate approximately equal to
the amount by which its inflation rate exceeds or is less than the U.S. rate.
Relative inflation rates also affect interest rates. The interest rate in any country is
largely determined by its inflation rate. Therefore, countries currently experiencing
higher rates of inflation than the United States also tend to have higher interest rates.
The reverse is true for countries with lower inflation rates.

It is tempting for a multinational corporation to borrow in countries with the low-
est interest rates. However, this is not always a good strategy. Suppose, for example,
that interest rates in Switzerland are lower than those in the United States because of
Switzerland’s lower inflation rate. A U.S. multinational firm could therefore save in-
terest by borrowing in Switzerland. However, because of relative inflation rates, the
Swiss franc will probably appreciate in the future, causing the dollar cost of annual
interest and principal payments on Swiss debt to rise over time. Thus, the lower inter-
est rate could be more than offset by losses from currency appreciation. Similarly, multina-
tional corporations should not necessarily avoid borrowing in a country such as
Brazil, where interest rates have been very high, because future depreciation of the
Brazilian real could make such borrowing end up being relatively inexpensive.
Self-Test
What effects do relative inflation rates have on relative interest rates?
What happens over time to the currencies of countries with higher inflation rates
than that of the United States? To those with lower inflation rates?
Why might a multinational corporation decide to borrow in a country such as Brazil,
where interest rates are high, rather than in a country like Switzerland, where
interest rates are low?
17.10 INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND CAPITAL MARKETS
One way for U.S. citizens to invest in world markets is to buy the stocks of U.S. mul-
tinational corporations that invest directly in foreign countries. Another way is to
purchase foreign securities—stocks, bonds, or money market instruments issued by
foreign companies. Security investments are known as portfolio investments, and they
are distinguished from direct investments in physical assets by U.S. corporations.
From World War II through the 1960s, the U.S. capital markets dominated world
markets. Today, however, the value of U.S. securities represents less than one-fourth
the value of all securities. Given this situation, it is important for both corporate
managers and investors to have an understanding of international markets. Moreover,
these markets often offer better opportunities for raising or investing capital than are
available domestically.
Eurodollar Market
A Eurodollar is a U.S. dollar deposited in a bank outside the United States. (Although
they are called Eurodollars because they originated in Europe, Eurodollars are actually
any dollars deposited in any part of the world other than the United States.) The bank in
which the deposit is made may be a non-U.S. bank, such as Barclays Bank in London; the
foreign branch of a U.S. bank, such as Citibank’s Paris branch; or even a foreign branch of
a third-country bank, such as Barclays’ Munich branch. Most Eurodollar deposits are for
$500,000 or more, and they have maturities ranging from overnight to about 1 year.
The major difference between Eurodollar deposits and regular U.S. time deposits
is their geographic locations. The two types of deposits do not involve different
currencies—in both cases, dollars are on deposit. However, Eurodollars are outside
the direct control of the U.S. monetary authorities, so U.S. banking regulations,
including reserve requirements and FDIC insurance premiums, do not apply. The
absence of these costs means that the interest rate paid on Eurodollar deposits can
be higher than domestic U.S. rates on equivalent instruments.
The dollar is the leading international currency. However, British pounds, euros,
Swiss francs, Japanese yen, and other currencies are also deposited outside their home
countries; these Eurocurrencies are handled in exactly the same way as Eurodollars.
710
Part 7: Managing Global Operations

Eurodollars are borrowed by U.S. and foreign corporations for various purposes
but especially to pay for goods imported from the United States and to invest in
U.S. security markets. Also, U.S. dollars are used as an international currency or
medium of exchange, and many Eurodollars are also used for this purpose. It is inter-
esting to note that Eurodollars were actually “invented” by the Soviets in 1946. Inter-
national merchants did not trust the Soviets or their rubles, so the Soviets bought
some dollars (for gold), deposited them in a Paris bank, and then used these dollars
to buy goods in the world markets. Others found it convenient to use dollars this
same way, and soon the Eurodollar market was in full swing.
Eurodollars are usually held in interest-bearing accounts. The interest rate paid on
these deposits depends (1) on the bank’s lending rate, since the interest a bank earns
on loans determines its willingness and ability to pay interest on deposits, and (2) on
rates of return available on U.S. money market instruments. If money market rates in
the United States were above Eurodollar deposit rates then these dollars would be
sent back and invested in the United States, whereas if Eurodollar deposit rates
were significantly above U.S. rates, which is more often the case, then more dollars
would be sent out of the United States to become Eurodollars. Given the existence of
the Eurodollar market and the electronic flow of dollars to and from the United
States, it is easy to see why interest rates in the United States cannot be insulated
from those in other parts of the world.
Interest rates on Eurodollar deposits (and loans) are tied to a standard rate known
by the acronym LIBOR, which stands for London Interbank Offered Rate.
LIBOR is the rate of interest offered by the largest and strongest London banks on
dollar deposits of significant size. On May 8, 2009, LIBOR rates were just a little
Greasing the Wheels of International Business
What do bribery and tax shelters have in common?
Both are targets of international regulation.
Thirty-seven countries have now signed the Organi-
zation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s
Anti-Bribery Convention. This requires each country to
pass legislation making it a crime for companies to
bribe public officials. The United States, which signed
the convention, has been the most aggressive in prose-
cuting violators. It is interesting that this prosecution
has not been limited to U.S. companies but also has
extended to foreign companies whose stocks are listed
in the United States. For example, Statoil, a Norwegian
firm, was fined $10.5 million in 2006 for bribing Iranian
officials. Subsidiaries of Vetco International, headquar-
tered in the United Kingdom, were fined $26 million in
2007 for bribing Nigerian officials. Siemens, a German
company, holds the record for the largest fine paid to
date (2009), with over $1.6 billion paid to regulatory
agencies in the United States and Germany.
Among the international organizations striving to re-
form global taxation and eliminate tax-shelter abuse are
the Joint International Tax Shelter Information Centre,
the Seven Country Working Group, and the Leeds Cas-
tle Group. Their goals include improving transparency,
eliminating double taxation, and abolishing tax havens.
What does the reformation of tax havens have in
common with the elimination of bribery? First, both of
these problems distract companies from focusing on
their core business issues, and both create uneven
playing fields where providing the best product at the
best price isn’t as important as who you know (and
bribe!) or how clever your lawyers are. Second, these
problems reduce transparency in capital markets, mak-
ing it harder for investors to identify the best firms.
When investors are uncertain about a company, the
cost of capital goes up. Thus, there is a direct link be-
tween transparency and a company’s ability to raise
capital at a fair price.

above domestic U.S. bank rates on time deposits of the same maturity—0.75% for
3-month CDs versus 0.99% for LIBOR CDs. The Eurodollar market is essentially a
short-term market; most loans and deposits are for less than 1 year.
International Bond Markets
Any bond sold outside the country of the borrower is called an international bond. How-
ever, there are two important types of international bonds: foreign bonds and
Eurobonds. Foreign bonds are bonds sold by a foreign borrower but denominated in
the currency of the country in which the issue is sold. For instance, Nortel Networks
(a Canadian company) may need U.S. dollars to finance the operations of its subsidiar-
ies in the United States. If it decides to raise the needed capital in the United States,
then the bond would be underwritten by a syndicate of U.S. investment bankers,
denominated in U.S. dollars, and sold to U.S. investors in accordance with SEC and
applicable state regulations. Except for the foreign origin of the borrower, this bond
would be indistinguishable from those issued by equivalent U.S. corporations. However,
since Nortel is a foreign corporation, the bond would be a foreign bond. Furthermore,
because it is denominated in dollars and sold in the United States under SEC regula-
tions, it is also called a Yankee bond. In contrast, if Nortel issued bonds in Mexico
that were denominated in pesos then they would be foreign bonds, not Yankee bonds.
The term Eurobond is used to designate any bond issued in one country but de-
nominated in the currency of some other country. Examples include a Ford Motor
Company issue denominated in dollars and sold in Germany and a British firm’s
sale of euro-denominated bonds in Switzerland. The institutional arrangements by
which Eurobonds are marketed are different than those for most other bond issues,
with the most important distinction being a far lower level of required disclosure
than is usually found for bonds issued in domestic markets, particularly in the United
States. Governments tend to be less strict when regulating securities denominated in
foreign currencies, because the bonds’ purchasers are generally more “sophisticated.”
The lower disclosure requirements result in lower total transaction costs for
Eurobonds.
Eurobonds appeal to investors for several reasons. Generally, they are issued in
bearer form rather than as registered bonds, so the names and nationalities of
investors are not recorded. Individuals who desire anonymity, whether for privacy
reasons or for tax avoidance, like Eurobonds. Similarly, most governments do not
withhold taxes on interest payments associated with Eurobonds. If the investor
requires an effective yield of 10%, then a Eurobond that is exempt from tax with-
holding would simply need a coupon rate of 10%. Another type of bond—for
instance, a domestic issue subject to a 30% withholding tax on interest paid to
foreigners—would need a coupon rate of 14.3% to yield an after-withholding rate
of 10%. Investors who desire secrecy would not want to file for a refund of the tax,
so they would prefer to hold the Eurobond.
More than half of all Eurobonds are denominated in dollars. Bonds in Japanese
yen, German marks, and Dutch guilders account for most of the rest. Although cen-
tered in Europe, Eurobonds are truly international. Their underwriting syndicates
include investment bankers from all parts of the world, and the bonds are sold to
investors not only in Europe but also in such faraway places as Bahrain and Singa-
pore. Up to a few years ago, Eurobonds were issued solely by multinational firms,
by international financial institutions, or by national governments. Today, however,
the Eurobond market is also being tapped by purely domestic U.S. firms, which often
find they can lower their debt costs by borrowing overseas.
712
Part 7: Managing Global Operations

International Stock Markets
New issues of stock are sold in international markets for a variety of reasons. For ex-
ample, a non-U.S. firm might sell an equity issue in the United States because it can
tap a much larger source of capital than in its home country. Also, a U.S. firm might
tap a foreign market because it wants to create an equity market presence to accom-
pany its operations in that country. Large multinational companies also occasionally
issue new stock simultaneously in multiple countries. For example, Alcan Aluminum,
a Canadian company, issued new stock in Canada, Europe, and the United States si-
multaneously, using different underwriting syndicates in each market.
In addition to new issues, outstanding stocks of large multinational companies are
increasingly being listed on multiple international exchanges. For example, Coca-
Cola’s stock is traded on six stock exchanges in the United States, four stock
exchanges in Switzerland, and the Frankfurt stock exchange in Germany. Some 500
foreign stocks are listed in the United States—an example here is Royal Dutch Petro-
leum, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. investors can also invest
in foreign companies through American Depository Receipts (ADRs), which are cer-
tificates representing ownership of foreign stock held in trust. About 1,700 ADRs are
now available in the United States, with most of them traded on the over-the-counter
Stock Market Indices around the World
In the United States, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
(^DJI) is the most well-known stock market index. Simi-
lar indices also exist for each major world financial cen-
ter. As shown in the accompanying table, India’s market
has had the strongest performance during the past 10
years while Japan’s has had the weakest.

17.11 MULTINATIONAL CAPITAL BUDGETING
Until now we’ve discussed the general environment in which multinational firms
operate. In the remainder of the chapter, we see how international factors affect key
corporate decisions, beginning with capital budgeting. Although the same basic prin-
ciples apply to capital budgeting for both foreign and domestic operations, there are
some key differences. These include the types of risks faced by the firm, cash flow
estimation, and project analysis.5
Risk Exposure
Foreign projects may be more or less risky than equivalent domestic projects, and
that can lead to differences in the cost of capital. Higher risk for foreign projects
tends to result from two primary sources: (1) exchange rate risk and (2) political
risk. However, international diversification might result in a lower risk.
Exchange rate risk concerns the value of the basic cash flows in the parent com-
pany’s home currency. Foreign currency cash flows turned over to the parent must be
converted into U.S. dollars, so projected cash flows must be translated to dollars at the
expected future exchange rates. An analysis should be conducted to ascertain the effects
of exchange rate variations on dollar cash flows; then, on the basis of this analysis, an
exchange rate risk premium should be added to the domestic cost of capital. It is some-
times possible to hedge against exchange rate risk, but it may not be possible to hedge
completely, especially on long-term projects. If hedging is used, then the costs of doing
so must be subtracted from the project’s operating cash flows.
Political risk refers to potential actions by a host government that would reduce
the value of a company’s investment. It includes at one extreme expropriation of the
subsidiary’s assets without compensation, but it also includes less drastic actions that
reduce the value of the parent firm’s investment in the foreign subsidiary.6 Included
here are higher taxes, tighter repatriation or currency controls, and restrictions on
prices charged. The risk of expropriation is small in traditionally friendly and stable

countries such as Great Britain or Switzerland. However, in Latin America, Africa, the
Far East, and Eastern Europe, the risk may be substantial. Past expropriations include
those of ITT and Anaconda Copper in Chile; Gulf Oil in Bolivia; Occidental Petro-
leum in Libya; Enron Corporation in Peru; BP, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, and
Chevron in Venezuela; and the assets of many companies in Iraq, Iran, and Cuba.
Note that companies can take steps to reduce the potential loss from expropria-
tion, including one or more of the following.
1. Finance the subsidiary with local capital.
2. Structure operations so that the subsidiary has value only as a part of the
integrated corporate system.
3. Obtain insurance against economic losses from expropriation from a source such
as the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC).
If OPIC insurance is purchased, then the premiums paid must be added to the
project’s cost.
Several organizations rate countries according to different aspects of risk. For exam-
ple, Transparency International (TI) ranks countries based on perceived corruption,
which is an important part of political risk. Table 17-4 shows selected countries. Den-
mark, New Zealand, and Sweden are rated by TI as the most honest countries, while
Somalia is the most dishonest. The United States is ranked eighteenth.
Cash Flow Estimation
Cash flow estimation is more complex for foreign than domestic investments. Most
multinational firms set up separate subsidiaries in each foreign country in which
they operate, and the relevant cash flows for the parent company are the dividends
Consumer Finance in China
The financial frontier for consumer finance is in China,
where applicants must often wait more than a month to
get a credit card and even longer for car loans or home
mortgages. But that is changing quickly, as GE Money (for-
merly known as GE Capital) is among a host of financial
players looking to partner with or become part owners of
Chinese banks. Other foreign investors include financial in-
stitutions from all over the world, such as Citigroup (United
States), ING Group (Netherlands), Hang Seng Bank (Hong
Kong), and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Even investment
banks (Goldman Sachs) and private equity firms (New-
bridge Capital) are in the hunt.
What makes Chinese banks attractive? First, China is
now allowing foreign-owned banks to make direct loans
to Chinese customers. Second, China has a huge con-
sumer base with a growing middle class that is purchasing
homes, cars, and other consumer goods. Third, many Chi-
nese banks might be considered “fixer-uppers” because
they hold too many uncollectible loans (up to 9.2% of their
loan portfolios), have weak information technology sys-
tems, and provide poor customer service. These problems
are viewed as opportunities by GE Money, which brings
considerable business expertise (in addition to cash) to
the partnership. For example, GE Money helped Shenzhen
Development Bank (SDB) introduce a Wal-Mart credit card,
an Auchen credit card (Auchen is a large French retailer),
and various mortgage services. All the results aren’t yet in,
but GE has helped SDB reduce the time to get a credit card
from over a month to just 5 days.
Investing in China isn’t without risks, with an esti-
mated 60% of partnerships not providing the return that
was anticipated at the deal’s inception. Problems include
insufficient pre-deal planning, a lack of focus and traction
in the immediate post-deal period, a failure to integrate
cultures, and a lack of flexibility in adapting to local con-
ditions. Still, the potential rewards are enormous, so you
should expect to see more foreign investment in China.

and royalties paid by the subsidiaries to the parent, translated into dollars. Dividends
and royalties are normally taxed by both foreign and home country governments,
although the home country may allow credits for some or all of the foreign taxes
paid. Furthermore, a foreign government may restrict the amount of the cash that
may be repatriated to the parent company. For example, some governments place a
ceiling, stated as a percentage of the company’s net worth, on the amount of cash
dividends that a subsidiary can pay to its parent. Such restrictions are normally
intended to force multinational firms to reinvest earnings in the foreign country,
although restrictions are sometimes imposed to prevent large currency outflows,
which might disrupt the exchange rate.
Whatever the host country’s motivation for blocking repatriation of profits, the
result is that the parent corporation cannot use cash flows blocked in the foreign
country to pay dividends to its shareholders or to invest elsewhere in the business.
Hence, from the perspective of the parent organization, the cash flows relevant for
foreign investment analysis are the cash flows that the subsidiary is actually expected
to send back to the parent. Note, though, that if returns on investments in the for-
eign country are attractive and if blockages are expected to be lifted in the future,
then current blockages may not be bad; however, dealing with this situation does
complicate the process of cash flow estimation.
Some companies attempt to circumvent repatriation restrictions (and to lower
their taxes) through the use of transfer pricing. For example, a foreign subsidiary
might obtain raw materials or other input components from the parent. The price
the subsidiary pays the parent is called a transfer price. If the transfer price is high
then the foreign subsidiary’s costs will be high, leaving little or no profit to repatriate.
However, the parent’s profit will be higher because it sold to the subsidiary at an
inflated transfer price. The net result is that the parent receives cash flows from the
subsidiary via transfer pricing rather than as repatriated dividends. Transfer pricing

can also be used to shift profits from high-tax to low-tax jurisdictions. Of course,
governments are well aware of these possibilities, so governmental auditors are on
guard to prevent abusive transfer pricing.
Project Analysis
First, consider a domestic project that requires foreign raw materials, or one where
the finished product will be sold in a foreign market. Because the operation is based
in the United States, any projected nondollar cash flows—costs in the first example
and revenues in the second—should be converted into dollars. This conversion does
not present much of a problem for cash flows to be paid or received in the short run,
but there is a significant problem in estimating exchange rates for converting long-
term foreign cash flows into dollars because forward exchange rates are usually not
available for more than 180 days into the future. However, long-term expected for-
ward exchange rates can be estimated using the idea behind the interest rate parity
relationship. For example, if a foreign cash flow is expected to occur in 1 year, then
the 1-year forward exchange rate can be estimated using domestic and foreign gov-
ernment bonds maturing in 1 year. Similarly, the 2-year exchange rate can be
estimated using 2-year bonds. Thus, foreign cash flows can be converted into dollars
and added to the project’s other projected cash flows, and then the project’s NPV can
be calculated based on its cost of capital.
Now consider a project to be based overseas, so that most expected future cash
flows will be denominated in a foreign currency. Two approaches can be used to
estimate such a project’s NPV. Both begin by forecasting the future cash flows
denominated in the foreign currency and then determining the annual repatriations
to the United States, denominated in the foreign currency. Under the first
approach, we convert the expected future repatriations to dollars (as described
earlier) and then find the NPV using the project’s cost of capital. Under the second
approach, we take the projected repatriations (denominated in the foreign cur-
rency) and then discount them at the foreign cost of capital, which reflects foreign
interest rates and relevant risk premiums. This produces an NPV denominated in
the foreign currency, which can be converted into a dollar-denominated NPV
using the spot exchange rate.
The following example illustrates the first approach. A U.S. company has the
opportunity to lease a manufacturing facility in Great Britain for 3 years. The com-
pany must spend £20 million initially to refurbish the plant. The expected net cash
flows from the plant for the next 3 years, in millions, are CF1 = £7, CF2 = £9, and
CF3 = £11. A similar project in the United States would have a risk-adjusted cost of
capital of 10%. The first step is to estimate the expected exchange rates at the end of
1, 2, and 3 years using the multi-year interest rate parity equation:
Expected t-year forward exchange rate ¼ ðSpot exchange rateÞ 1 þ rh
1 þ rf

t
(17-4)
where the exchange rates are expressed in direct quotations and the interest rates are
expressed as annual rates, not periodic rates. We are using the interest rate parity
equation to estimate expected forward rates because market-based forward rates for
maturities longer than a year are generally not available.
Suppose the spot exchange rate is 1.8000 dollars per pound. Interest rates on U.S.
and U.K. government bonds are shown below, along with the expected forward rate
implied by the multi-year interest rate parity relationship in Equation 17-4:

The current dollar cost of the project is £20(1.8000 $/£) = $36 million. The Year-1

plete time line and the net present value of $2.18 million.

17.12 INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL STRUCTURES
Companies’ capital structures vary among countries. For example, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recently reported that, on average,
Japanese firms use 85% debt to total assets (in book value terms), German firms use
64%, and U.S. firms use 55%. One problem when interpreting these numbers is that
different countries often use different accounting conventions with regard to (1)
reporting assets on the basis of historical versus replacement cost, (2) the treatment of
leased assets, (3) pension plan funding, and (4) capitalizing versus expensing R&D
costs. These differences make it difficult to compare capital structures.
A study by Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago at-
tempted to account for differences in accounting practices. In their study, Rajan and
Zingales used a database that covered fewer firms than the OECD but that provided
a more complete breakdown of balance sheet data. They concluded that differences
in accounting practices can explain much of the cross-country variation in capital
structures.

Part 7: Managing Global Operations

Rajan and Zingales’s results are summarized in Table 17-6. There are a number of
different ways to measure capital structure. One measure is the average ratio of total
liabilities to total assets—this is similar to the measure used by the OECD, and it is
reported in Column 1. Based on this measure, German and Japanese firms appear to
be more highly levered than U.S. firms. However, if you look at Column 2, where
capital structure is measured by interest-bearing debt to total assets, it appears that
German firms use less leverage than U.S. and Japanese firms. What explains these
conflicting results? Rajan and Zingales argue that much of the difference is explained
by the way German firms account for pension liabilities. German firms generally in-
clude all pension liabilities (and their offsetting assets) on the balance sheet, whereas
firms in other countries (including the United States) generally “net out” pension as-
sets and liabilities on their balance sheets. To see the importance of this difference,
consider a firm with $10 million in liabilities (not including pension liabilities) and
$20 million in assets (not including pension assets). Assume that the firm has
$10 million in pension liabilities that are fully funded by $10 million in pension as-
sets. Therefore, net pension liabilities are zero. If this firm were in the United States,
it would report a ratio of total liabilities to total assets equal to 50% ($10 million/$20
million). By contrast, if this firm operated in Germany, both its pension assets and
liabilities would be reported on the balance sheet. The firm would have $20 million
in liabilities and $30 million in assets—or a 67% ($20 million/$30 million) ratio of
total liabilities to total assets. Total debt is the sum of short-term debt and long-
term debt and excludes other liabilities, including pension liabilities. Therefore, the
measure of total debt to total assets provides a more comparable measure of leverage
across different countries.

Rajan and Zingales also make a variety of adjustments that attempt to control for
other differences in accounting practices. The effects of these adjustments are
reported in Columns 3 and 4. Overall, the evidence suggests that companies in Ger-
many and the United Kingdom tend to have less leverage, and that firms in Canada
appear to have more leverage, than firms in the United States, France, Italy, and
Japan. This conclusion is supported by data in the final column, which shows the
average times-interest-earned ratio for firms in a number of different countries.
Recall from Chapter 3 that the times-interest-earned ratio is the ratio of operating
income (EBIT) to interest expense. This measure indicates how much cash the firm
has available to service its interest expense. In general, firms with more leverage have
a lower times-interest-earned ratio. The data indicate that this ratio is highest in the
United Kingdom and Germany and lowest in Canada.

17.13 MULTINATIONAL WORKING
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Working capital management in a multinational setting involves more complexity than
purely domestic working capital management. We discuss some of these differences in
this section.
Cash Management
The goals of cash management in a multinational corporation are similar to those in
a purely domestic corporation: (1) to speed up collections, slow down disbursements,
and thus maximize net float; (2) to shift cash as rapidly as possible from those parts of
the business where it is not needed to those parts where it is needed; and (3) to max-
imize the risk-adjusted, after-tax rate of return on temporary cash balances. Multina-
tional companies use the same general procedures for achieving these goals as
domestic firms, but the longer distances and more serious mail delays make such
devices as lockbox systems and electronic funds transfers especially important.
Although multinational and domestic corporations have the same objectives and
use similar procedures, multinational corporations face a far more complex task. As
noted earlier in our discussion of political risk, foreign governments often place
restrictions on transfers of funds out of the country. So even though IBM can trans-
fer money from its Salt Lake City office to its New York concentration bank just by
pressing a few buttons, a similar transfer from its Buenos Aires office is far more
complex. Buenos Aires funds must be converted to dollars before the transfer. If
there is a shortage of dollars in Argentina or if the Argentinean government wants
to conserve dollars so they will be available for the purchase of strategic materials,
then conversion, and hence the transfer, may be blocked. Even if no dollar shortage
exists in Argentina, the government may still restrict funds outflows if those funds
represent profits or depreciation rather than payments for purchased materials or
equipment, because many countries—especially those that are less developed—want
profits reinvested in the country in order to stimulate economic growth.
Once it has been determined what funds can be transferred, the next task is to get
those funds to locations where they will earn the highest returns. Whereas domestic
corporations tend to think in terms of domestic securities, multinationals are more
likely to be aware of investment opportunities all around the world. Most multina-
tional corporations use one or more global concentration banks, located in money
720
Part 7: Managing Global Operations

centers such as London, New York, Tokyo, Zurich, or Singapore, and their staffs in
those cities, working with international bankers, are able to take advantage of the best
rates available anywhere in the world.
Credit Management
Consider the international cash conversion cycle for a foreign company importing
from the United States: The order is placed, the goods are shipped, an account pay-
able is created for the importer and an account receivable is created for the exporter,
the goods arrive in the foreign country, the importer sells them, and the importer
collects on the sales. At some point in this process, the importer pays off the account
payable, which is usually before the importer collects on its own sales. Notice that
the importer must finance the transaction from the time it pays the account payable
until it collects on its sales. In many poorer, less-developed nations, the capital mar-
kets are not adequate to enable the importer to finance the cash conversion cycle.
Even when foreign capital markets are available, the additional shipping time might
lengthen the cash conversion cycle to such an extent that the importer can’t afford
the financing costs. Thus, there is enormous pressure on the exporter to grant credit,
often with very lengthy payment periods.
But now consider the situation from the exporter’s point of view. First, it is much
more difficult for the exporter to perform a credit analysis on a foreign customer. Sec-
ond, the exporter must also worry about exchange-rate fluctuations between the time
of the sale and the time the receivable is collected. For example, if IBM sold a com-
puter to a Japanese customer for 90 million yen when the exchange rate was 90 yen
to the dollar, IBM would obtain 90,000,000/90 = $1,000,000 for the computer. How-
ever, if it sold the computer on terms of net/6 months and if the yen then fell against
the dollar, so that 1 dollar would now buy 112.5 yen, IBM would end up realizing only
90,000,000/112.5 = $800,000 when it collected the receivable. Hedging with forward
contracts can reduce this exchange rate risk, but what about the credit risk?
One possibility is for the importer to obtain a letter of credit from its bank
whereby the bank certifies that the importer will meet the terms of the account pay-
able or else the bank will pay. However, the importer often must pay the bank a rel-
atively large fee for the letter of credit, and letters of credit might not be available to
companies in developing countries.
A second option is for the importer to essentially write a check to the exporter at the
time of the purchase, but one that is postdated so that it cannot be cashed until
the account payable’s due date. If the importer’s bank promises that it will “accept”
the check even if there are insufficient funds in the importer’s account, then the check
becomes a financial instrument that is called a banker’s acceptance. If the bank is
strong, then this virtually eliminates the credit risk. In addition, the exporter can then
sell this banker’s acceptance in the secondary market if it needs funds immediately. Of
course, it must sell the banker’s acceptance at a discount to reflect the time value of
money, because the banker’s acceptance is essentially a short-term financial security
that pays no interest, similar to a T-bill. Financing an international transaction via a
banker’s acceptance has many benefits for the exporter, but the importer often must
pay the bank a relatively large fee, and this service might not be available to companies
in developing countries.
A third alternative is for the exporter to purchase export credit insurance, in which
an insurer makes a commitment to pay the exporter even if the importer defaults.
Sometimes the “insurer” is a government agency, such as the Japanese Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI) or the United States Export-Import Bank.
Other times, the insurer is a private insurance company. These large insurance
Chapter 17: Multinational Financial Management
721

companies have developed expertise in international credit analysis, and they can
spread the risk over a large number of customers. These advantages allow them to
offer credit insurance at rates that often make it less costly than either letters of
credit or bankers’ acceptances. In fact, export credit insurance has been so successful
that it has virtually killed the market for bankers’ acceptances and has become the
primary method companies use to manage the credit risk of international sales.
Inventory Management
As with most other aspects of finance, inventory management for a firm in a multina-
tional setting is similar to but more complex than for a purely domestic firm. First,
there is the matter of the physical location of inventories. For example, where should
ExxonMobil keep its stockpiles of crude oil and refined products? It has refineries
and marketing centers located worldwide, and one alternative is to keep items con-
centrated in a few strategic spots from which they can then be shipped as needs arise.
Such a strategy might minimize the total amount of inventories needed and thus
might minimize the investment in inventories. Note, though, that consideration will
have to be given to potential delays in getting goods from central storage locations to
user locations all around the world. Both working stocks and safety stocks would have
to be maintained at each user location as well as at the strategic storage centers.
Problems like the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent trade
embargo, which brought with it the potential for a shutdown of production of about
25% of the world’s oil supply, complicate matters further.
Exchange rates also influence inventory policy. If a local currency—say, the
Danish krone—were expected to rise in value against the dollar, then a U.S. company
operating in Denmark would want to increase stocks of local products before the rise
in the krone, and vice versa if the krone were expected to fall.
Another factor that must be considered is the possibility of import or export quotas
or tariffs. For example, Apple Computer Company was buying certain memory chips
from Japanese suppliers at a bargain price. Then U.S. chipmakers accused the Japanese
of dumping chips in the U.S. market at prices below cost, and they sought to force the
Japanese to raise their prices.7 This led Apple to increase its chip inventory. Then com-
puter sales slacked off, and Apple ended up with an oversupply of obsolete computer
chips. As a result, Apple’s profits were hurt and its stock price fell, demonstrating
once more the importance of careful inventory management.
As mentioned earlier, another danger in certain countries is the threat of expropri-
ation. If that threat is large, then inventory holdings will be minimized and goods will
be brought in only as needed. Similarly, if the operation involves extraction of raw
materials such as oil or bauxite, processing plants may be moved offshore rather
than located close to the production site.
Taxes have two effects on multinational inventory management. First, countries
often impose property taxes on assets, including inventories; when this is done, the
7The term “dumping” warrants explanation, because the practice can be so important in international
markets. Suppose Japanese chipmakers have excess capacity. A particular chip has a variable cost of $25,
and its “fully allocated cost,” which is the $25 plus total fixed cost per unit of output, is $40. Now suppose
the Japanese firm can sell chips in the United States at $35 per unit, but if it charges $40 then it won’t
make any sales because U.S. chipmakers sell for $35.50. If the Japanese firm sells at $35, it will cover var-
iable costs plus make a contribution to fixed overhead, so selling at $35 makes sense. Continuing, if the
Japanese firm can sell in Japan at $40 but U.S. firms are excluded from Japanese markets by import duties
or other barriers, then the Japanese will have a huge advantage over U.S. manufacturers. This practice of
selling goods at lower prices in foreign markets than at home is called “dumping.” U.S. firms are required
by antitrust laws to offer the same price to all customers and, therefore, cannot engage in dumping.

Part 7: Managing Global Operations

tax is based on holdings as of a specific date, such as January 1 or March 1. Such
rules make it advantageous for a multinational firm (1) to schedule production so
that inventories are low on the assessment date, and (2) if assessment dates vary
among countries in a region, to hold safety stocks in different countries at different
times during the year.
Finally, multinational firms may consider the possibility of at-sea storage. Oil,
chemical, grain, and other companies that deal in a bulk commodity that must be
stored in some type of tank can often buy tankers at a cost not much greater—or
perhaps even less, considering land cost—than land-based facilities. Loaded tankers
can then be kept at sea or at anchor in some strategic location. This eliminates the
danger of expropriation, minimizes the property tax problem, and maximizes flexibil-
ity with regard to shipping to areas where needs are greatest or prices highest.
This discussion has only scratched the surface of inventory management in the
multinational corporation—the task is much more complex than for a purely domes-
tic firm. However, the greater the degree of complexity, the greater the rewards from
superior performance, so if you are willing to take challenges along with potentially
high rewards then look to the international arena.

multinational corporation than in a purely domestic corporation?

Summary
Multinational companies have more opportunities but also face different risks than
do companies that operate only in their home market. This chapter discussed many
of the key trends affecting the global markets today, and it described the most impor-
tant differences between multinational and domestic financial management. The key
concepts are listed below.
•
International operations are becoming increasingly important to individual
firms and to the national economy. A multinational, transnational, or global
corporation is a firm that operates in an integrated fashion in a number of
countries.
•
Companies “go global” for these reasons: (1) to expand their markets, (2) to
obtain raw materials, (3) to seek new technology, (4) to lower production costs,
(5) to avoid trade barriers, and (6) to diversify.
•
Several major factors distinguish financial management as practiced by domestic
firms from that practiced by multinational corporations: (1) different currency
denominations, (2) different economic and legal structures, (3) languages, (4)
cultural differences, (5) role of governments, and (6) political risk.
•
When discussing exchange rates, the number of U.S. dollars required to
purchase one unit of a foreign currency is called a direct quotation, while the
number of units of foreign currency that can be purchased for one U.S. dollar is
an indirect quotation.
•
Exchange rate fluctuations make it difficult to estimate the dollars that overseas
operations will produce.
•
Prior to August 1971, the world was on a fixed exchange rate system whereby
the U.S. dollar was linked to gold and other currencies were then tied to the
dollar. After August 1971, the world monetary system changed to a floating
Chapter 17: Multinational Financial Management
723

system under which major world currency rates float with market forces, largely
unrestricted by governmental intervention. The central bank of each country
does operate in the foreign exchange market, buying and selling currencies to
smooth out exchange rate fluctuations, but only to a limited extent.
•
Pegged exchange rates occur when a country establishes a fixed exchange rate
with a major currency. Consequently, the values of pegged currencies move
together over time.
•
A convertible currency is one that may be readily exchanged for other
currencies.
•
Spot rates are the rates paid for delivery of currency “on the spot,” whereas the
forward exchange rate is the rate paid for delivery at some agreed-upon future
date—usually 30, 90, or 180 days from the day the transaction is negotiated. The
forward rate can be at either a premium or a discount to the spot rate.
•
Interest rate parity holds that investors should expect to earn the same risk-free
return in all countries after adjusting for exchange rates.
•
Purchasing power parity, sometimes referred to as the law of one price, implies
that the level of exchange rates adjusts so that identical goods cost the same in
different countries.
•
Granting credit is more risky in an international context because, in addition to the
normal risks of default, the multinational firm must worry about exchange rate
changes between the time a sale is made and the time a receivable is collected.
•
Credit policy is important for a multinational firm for two reasons: (1) Much
trade is with less-developed nations, and in such situations granting credit is a
necessary condition for doing business. (2) The governments of nations such as
Japan, whose economic health depends on exports, often help their firms com-
pete by granting credit to foreign customers.
•
Foreign investments are similar to domestic investments, but political risk and
exchange rate risk must be considered. Political risk is the risk that the foreign
government will take some action that will decrease the value of the investment;
exchange rate risk is the risk of losses due to fluctuations in the value of the
dollar relative to the values of foreign currencies.
•
Investments in international capital projects expose firms to exchange rate risk
and political risk. The relevant cash flows in international capital budgeting are
the dollars that can be repatriated to the parent company.
•
Eurodollars are U.S. dollars deposited in banks outside the United States. Interest
rates on Eurodollars are tied to LIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate.
•
U.S. firms often find that they can raise long-term capital at a lower cost outside
the United States by selling bonds in the international capital markets. Inter-
national bonds may be either foreign bonds, which are exactly like regular
domestic bonds except that the issuer is a foreign company, or Eurobonds,
which are bonds sold in a foreign country but denominated in the currency of
the issuing company’s home country.

year is expected to be $1.60 per pound, and the pound is expected to depreciate 5%
against the dollar each year for an indefinite period. The dividend (in pounds) is ex-
pected to grow at 10% a year indefinitely. The parent U.S. corporation owns 10 million

Foreign Capital
Budgeting
Solitaire Machinery is a Swiss multinational manufacturing company. Currently,
Solitaire’s financial planners are considering whether to undertake a 1-year project
in the United States. The project’s expected dollar-denominated cash flows consist
of an initial investment of $1,000 and a cash inflow the following year of $1,200.
Solitaire estimates that its risk-adjusted cost of capital is 14%. Currently, 1 U.S. dol-
lar will buy 1.62 Swiss francs. In addition, 1-year risk-free securities in the United
States are yielding 7.25%, while similar securities in Switzerland are yielding 4.5%.
a. If this project were instead undertaken by a similar U.S.-based company with the
same risk-adjusted cost of capital, what would be the net present value and rate
of return generated by this project?
b. What is the expected forward exchange rate 1 year from now?
c. If Solitaire undertakes the project, what is the net present value and rate of re-
turn of the project for Solitaire?

complicated because Yohe usually sells its products in other foreign countries. One
product in particular, the SY-20 radio transmitter, draws its principal components—
Component X, Component Y, and Component Z—from Germany, Mexico, and Eng-
land, respectively. Specifically, Component X costs 84 euros, Component Y costs 650
Mexican pesos, and Component Z costs 105 British pounds. The largest market for the
SY-20 is in Japan, where it sells for 38,000 Japanese yen. Naturally, Yohe is intimately
concerned with economic conditions that could adversely affect dollar exchange rates.
You will find Tables 17-1, 17-2, and 17-3 useful for this problem.

Mini Case
Citrus Products Inc. is a medium-sized producer of citrus juice drinks with groves in Indian River
County, Florida. Until now, the company has confined its operations and sales to the United
States, but its CEO, George Gaynor, wants to expand into Europe. The first step would be to set
up sales subsidiaries in Spain and Sweden, then to set up a production plant in Spain, and finally to
distribute the product throughout the European common market. The firm’s financial manager,
Ruth Schmidt, is enthusiastic about the plan, but she is worried about the implications of the
foreign expansion on the firm’s financial management process. She has asked you, the firm’s
most recently hired financial analyst, to develop a 1-hour tutorial package that explains the basics
of multinational financial management. The tutorial will be presented at the next board of direc-

years, in millions, are CF1 = ¥500 and CF2 = ¥800. A similar project in the
United States would have a risk-adjusted cost of capital of 10%. In the United
States, a 1-year government bond pays 2% interest and a 2-year bond pays

T
he Forty-Year-Old Virgin, starring Steve Carell, cost $26 million to
produce but grossed over $177 million at box offices worldwide.
That’s a lot of money, but there is a 25-year-old Virgin making even
more: Virgin Atlantic, the airline, turned 25 in 2009.
Virgin is privately held by Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Group (with
Singapore Airlines owning a 49% share), so we don’t know exactly how
much money Virgin is making, but in mid-2009 Virgin placed an order for
10 Airbus A330-300 jet airliners that will cost about $2.1 billion. Virgin is
planning on purchasing 6 of the jets and then immediately selling them to
AerCap Holdings NV, a Dutch company specializing in leasing aircraft.
AerCap will then lease the jets back to Virgin. In addition, AerCap will
purchase 4 of the jets directly from Airbus and then lease them to Virgin.
The bottom line is that Virgin won’t have to pony up $2.1 billion to get the
10 jets, but Virgin will get to operate the aircraft because it will make lease
payments to AerCap.
Virgin had previously placed orders with Boeing, a U.S. company, for
Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner. Because Boeing experienced a series of
production delays, Virgin turned to Airbus, which is owned by the
European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS). EADS itself
was formed in 2000 from a number of smaller companies at the
encouragement of many European governments desiring a European
company with the size and scope to be a major competitor in the global
aviation and defense business.
Thus, the 10 Airbus jets will be produced in Europe by EADS, owned by
the Dutch company AerCap, operated by the U.K. company Virgin Atlantic,
and flown all over the world. As you read this chapter, think about the ways
that leasing helps support global operations.
733

Firms generally own fixed assets and report them on their balance sheets, but it is the
use of assets that is important, not their ownership per se. One way to obtain the use of
facilities and equipment is to buy them, but an alternative is to lease them. Prior to the
1950s, leasing was generally associated with real estate—land and buildings. Today,
however, it is possible to lease virtually any kind of fixed asset, and currently over
30% of all new capital equipment is financed through lease arrangements.1 In fact,
the Equipment Leasing Association estimates that about 20,000 equipment leases are
signed each day in the United States, with around $220 billion in equipment held in
the form of leases.2 Because leases are so frequently used by virtually all businesses, it
is important for every manager to understand them.
18.1 TYPES OF LEASES
Lease transactions involve two parties: the lessor, who owns the property, and the
lessee, who obtains use of the property in exchange for one or more lease, or rental,
payments. (Note that the term lessee is pronounced “less-ee,” not “lease-ee,” and lessor
is pronounced “less-or.”) Because both parties must agree before a lease transaction
can be completed, this chapter discusses leasing from the perspectives of both the
lessor and the lessee.
Leasing takes several different forms, of which the five most important are:
(1) operating leases; (2) financial, or capital, leases; (3) sale-and-leaseback
arrangements; (4) combination leases; and (5) synthetic leases.
Operating Leases
Operating leases generally provide for both financing and maintenance. IBM was one
of the pioneers of the operating lease contract, and computers and office copying
machines—together with automobiles, trucks, and aircraft—are the primary types of
equipment involved in operating leases. Ordinarily, operating leases require the
lessor to maintain and service the leased equipment, and the cost of the maintenance
is built into the lease payments.
Another important characteristic of operating leases is the fact that they are not
fully amortized. In other words, the rental payments required under the lease contract
are not sufficient for the lessor to recover the full cost of the asset. However, the
lease contract is written for a period considerably shorter than the expected economic
life of the asset, so the lessor can expect to recover all costs either by subsequent
renewal payments, by re-leasing the asset to another lessee, or by selling the asset.
A final feature of operating leases is that they often contain a cancellation clause that
gives the lessee the right to cancel the lease and return the asset before the expiration
of the basic lease agreement. This is an important consideration to the lessee, for it
means that the asset can be returned if it is rendered obsolete by technological devel-
opments or is no longer needed because of a change in the lessee’s business.
Financial, or Capital, Leases
Financial leases, sometimes called capital leases, differ from operating leases in that
they (1) do not provide for maintenance service, (2) are not cancellable, and (3) are
fully amortized (that is, the lessor receives rental payments equal to the full price of

Making (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 1994).

the leased equipment plus a return on invested capital). In a typical arrangement, the
firm that will use the equipment (the lessee) selects the specific items it requires and
negotiates the price with the manufacturer. The user firm then arranges to have a
leasing company (the lessor) buy the equipment from the manufacturer and simulta-
neously executes a lease contract. The terms of the lease generally call for full amor-
tization of the lessor’s investment, plus a rate of return on the unamortized balance
that is close to the percentage rate the lessee would have paid on a secured loan. For
example, if the lessee had to pay 10% for a loan, then a rate of about 10% would be
built into the lease contract.
The lessee is generally given an option to renew the lease at a reduced rate upon
expiration of the basic lease. However, the basic lease usually cannot be cancelled
unless the lessor is paid in full. Also, the lessee generally pays the property taxes and
insurance on the leased property. Since the lessor receives a return after, or net of,
these payments, this type of lease is often called a “net, net” lease.
Sale-and-Leaseback Arrangements
Under a sale-and-leaseback arrangement, a firm that owns land, buildings, or equip-
ment sells the property to another firm and simultaneously executes an agreement to
lease the property back for a stated period under specific terms. The capital supplier
could be an insurance company, a commercial bank, a specialized leasing company,
the finance arm of an industrial firm, a limited partnership, or an individual investor.
The sale-and-leaseback plan is an alternative to a mortgage.
Note that the seller immediately receives the purchase price put up by the buyer.
At the same time, the seller-lessee retains the use of the property. The parallel to
borrowing is carried over to the lease payment schedule. Under a mortgage loan
arrangement, the lender would normally receive a series of equal payments just suffi-
cient to amortize the loan and to provide a specified rate of return on the outstanding
loan balance. Under a sale-and-leaseback arrangement, the lease payments are set up
exactly the same way—the payments are just sufficient to return the full purchase
price to the investor plus a stated return on the lessor’s investment.
Sale-and-leaseback arrangements are almost the same as financial leases; the major
difference is that the leased equipment is used, not new, and the lessor buys it from
the user-lessee instead of a manufacturer or a distributor. A sale-and-leaseback is thus
a special type of financial lease.
Combination Leases
Many lessors offer a wide variety of terms. Therefore, in practice leases often do not
fit exactly into the operating lease or financial lease category but combine some
features of each. Such leases are called combination leases. To illustrate, cancella-
tion clauses are normally associated with operating leases, but many of today’s finan-
cial leases also contain cancellation clauses. However, in financial leases these clauses
generally include prepayment provisions whereby the lessee must make penalty
payments sufficient to enable the lessor to recover the unamortized cost of the leased
property.
Synthetic Leases
A fifth type of lease, the synthetic lease, should also be mentioned. These leases were
first used in the early 1990s, and they became very popular in the mid- to late-1990s
when companies such as Enron and Tyco, as well as “normal” companies, discovered
that synthetic leases could be used to keep debt off their balance sheets. In a typical
Chapter 18: Lease Financing
735

synthetic lease, a corporation that wanted to acquire an asset—generally real estate,
with a very long life—with debt would first establish a special purpose entity, or
SPE. The SPE would then obtain financing, typically 97% debt provided by a finan-
cial institution and 3% equity provided by a party other than the corporation itself.3
The SPE would then use the funds to acquire the property, and the corporation
would lease the asset from the SPE, generally for a term of 3 to 5 years but with an
option to extend the lease, which the firm generally expected to exercise. Because of
the relatively short term of the lease, it was deemed to be an operating lease and
hence did not have to be capitalized and shown on the balance sheet.
A corporation that set up an SPE was required to do one of three things when the
lease expired: (1) pay off the SPE’s 97% loan; (2) refinance the loan at the current
interest rate, if the lender was willing to refinance at all; or (3) sell the asset and
make up any shortfall between the sale price and the amount of the loan. Thus, the
corporate user was guaranteeing the loan, yet it did not have to show an obligation
on its balance sheet.
Synthetic leases stayed under the radar until 2001. As we discuss in the next section,
long-term leases must be capitalized and shown on the balance sheet. Synthetic leases
were designed to get around this requirement, and neither the corporations that used
them (such as Enron and Tyco) nor the accounting firms that approved them (such as
Arthur Andersen) wanted anyone to look closely at them. However, the scandals of the
early 2000s led security analysts, the SEC, banking regulators, the FASB, and even
corporate boards of directors to begin seriously discussing SPEs and synthetic leases.
Investors and bankers subjectively downgraded companies that made heavy use of
them, and boards of directors began to tell their CFOs to stop using them and to close
down the ones that existed. In 2003, the FASB put in place rules that require compa-
nies to report on their balance sheets most special purpose entities and synthetic leases
of the type Enron abused, limiting management’s opportunity to hide these particular
transactions from shareholders.

18.2 TAX EFFECTS
The full amount of the lease payments is a tax-deductible expense for the lessee
provided the Internal Revenue Service agrees that a particular contract is a genuine lease
and not simply a loan called a lease. This makes it important that a lease contract be
written in a form acceptable to the IRS. A lease that complies with all IRS require-
ments is called a guideline, or tax-oriented, lease, and the tax benefits of ownership
(depreciation and any investment tax credits) belong to the lessor. The main provi-
sions of the tax guidelines are as follows:
3Enron’s CFO, Andy Fastow, and other insiders provided the equity for many of Enron’s SPEs. Also, a
number of Merrill Lynch’s executives provided SPE equity, allegedly to enable Merrill Lynch to obtain
profitable investment banking deals. The very fact that SPEs are so well suited to conceal what is going
on helped those who used them engage in shady deals that would have at least raised eyebrows had they
been disclosed. In fact, Fastow pled guilty to two counts of conspiracy in connection to Enron’s account-
ing fraud and ultimate bankruptcy. For more on this subject, see W. R. Pollert and E. J. Glickman,

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

1. The lease term (including any extensions or renewals at a fixed rental rate) must
not exceed 80% of the estimated useful life of the equipment at the commence-
ment of the lease transaction. Thus, an asset with a 10-year life can be leased for
no more than 8 years. Further, the remaining useful life must not be less than 1
year. Note that an asset’s expected useful life is normally much longer than its
MACRS depreciation class life.
2. The equipment’s estimated residual value (in constant dollars without adjustment
for inflation) at the expiration of the lease must be at least 20% of its value at the
start of the lease. This requirement can have the effect of limiting the maximum
lease term.
3. Neither the lessee nor any related party can have the right to purchase the
property at a predetermined fixed price. However, the lessee can be given an
option to buy the asset at its fair market value.
4. Neither the lessee nor any related party can pay or guarantee payment of any
part of the price of the leased equipment. Simply put, the lessee cannot make any
investment in the equipment other than through the lease payments.
5. The leased equipment must not be “limited use” property, defined as equipment
that can be used only by the lessee or a related party at the end of the lease.
The reason for the IRS’s concern about lease terms is that, without restrictions, a
company could set up a “lease” transaction calling for very rapid payments, which
would be tax deductible. The effect would be to depreciate the equipment over a
much shorter period than its MACRS class life. For example, suppose a firm planned
to acquire a $2 million computer that had a 3-year MACRS class life. The annual
depreciation allowances would be $660,000 in Year 1, $900,000 in Year 2, $300,000
in Year 3, and $140,000 in Year 4. If the firm were in the 40% federal-plus-state tax
bracket, the depreciation would provide a tax savings of $264,000 in Year 1, $360,000
in Year 2, $120,000 in Year 3, and $56,000 in Year 4, for a total savings of $800,000.
At a 6% discount rate, the present value of these tax savings would be $714,567.
Now suppose the firm could acquire the computer through a 1-year lease arrange-
ment with a leasing company for a payment of $2 million, with a $1 purchase option.
If the $2 million payment were treated as a lease payment, it would be fully deduct-
ible, so it would provide a tax savings of 0.4($2,000,000) = $800,000 versus a present
value of only $714,567 for the depreciation shelters. Thus, the lease payment and the
depreciation would both provide the same total amount of tax savings (40% of
$2,000,000, or $800,000), but the savings would come in faster with the 1-year lease,
giving it a higher present value. Therefore, if just any type of contract could be called
a lease and given tax treatment as a lease, then the timing of the tax shelters could be
speeded up as compared with ownership depreciation tax shelters. This speedup
would benefit companies, but it would be costly to the government. For this reason,
the IRS has established the rules just described for defining a lease for tax purposes.
Even though leasing can be used only within limits to speed up the effective
depreciation schedule, there are still times when very substantial tax benefits can be
derived from a leasing arrangement. For example, if a firm has incurred losses and
hence has no current tax liabilities, then its depreciation shelters are not very useful.
In this case, a leasing company set up by profitable companies such as GE or Philip
Morris can buy the equipment, receive the depreciation shelters, and then share these
benefits with the lessee by charging lower lease payments. This will be discussed in
detail later in the chapter, but the point now is that if firms are to obtain tax benefits
from leasing, the lease contract must be written in a manner that will qualify it as a
true lease under IRS guidelines. If there is any question about the legal status of the
Chapter 18: Lease Financing
737

contract, the financial manager must be sure to have the firm’s lawyers and accoun-
tants check the latest IRS regulations.
Note that a lease that does not meet the tax guidelines is called a non–tax-oriented
lease. For this type of lease, the lessee (1) is the effective owner of the leased property,
(2) can depreciate it for tax purposes, and (3) can deduct only the interest portion of each
lease payment.

18.3 FINANCIAL STATEMENT EFFECTS
Under certain conditions, neither the leased assets nor the liabilities under the lease
contract appear directly on the firm’s balance sheet. For this reason, leasing is often
called off–balance sheet financing. This point is illustrated in Table 18-1 by
the balance sheets of two hypothetical firms, B (for “borrow”) and L (for “lease”).
Initially, the balance sheets of both firms are identical, and they both have debt
ratios of 50%. Next, each firm decides to acquire a fixed asset costing $100. Firm
B borrows $100 and buys the asset, so both an asset and a liability go on its
balance sheet, and its debt ratio rises from 50% to 75%. Firm L leases the equip-
ment. The lease may call for fixed charges as high as or even higher than the
loan, and the obligations assumed under the lease may be equally or more dan-
gerous from the standpoint of potential bankruptcy, but the firm’s debt ratio
remains at only 50%.
To correct this problem, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
FASB Statement 13, which requires that, for an unqualified audit report, firms enter-
ing into financial (or capital) leases must restate their balance sheets and report the
leased asset as a fixed asset and the present value of the future lease payments as a

liability. This process is called capitalizing the lease, and its net effect is to cause
Firms B and L to have similar balance sheets—both of which will, in essence, resem-
ble the one shown for Firm B.4
The logic behind Statement 13 is as follows: If a firm signs a financial lease
contract, its obligation to make lease payments is just as binding as if it had signed a
loan agreement—the failure to make lease payments can bankrupt a firm just as fast
as the failure to make principal and interest payments on a loan. Therefore, for all
intents and purposes, a financial lease is identical to a loan.5 This being the case, if
a firm signs a financial lease agreement then the effect is to raise its true debt ratio,
and hence its true capital structure is changed. Therefore, if the firm had previously
established a target capital structure and if there is no reason to think the optimal
capital structure has changed, then lease financing requires additional equity support,
just as debt financing does.
If disclosure of the lease in our Table 18-1 example were not made, then Firm
L’s investors could be deceived into thinking its financial position is stronger than
it really is. Thus, even before FASB Statement 13 was issued, firms were required
to disclose the existence of long-term leases in footnotes to their financial state-
ments. At that time, it was debated as to whether or not investors recognized fully
the impact of leases and, in effect, would see that Firms B and L were in essentially
the same financial position. Some people argued that leases were not fully recog-
nized, even by sophisticated investors. If this were the case, then leasing could alter
the capital structure decision in a significant manner—a firm could increase its true
leverage through a lease arrangement, and this procedure would have a smaller
effect on its cost of conventional debt, rd, and on its cost of equity, rs, than if it
had borrowed directly and reflected this fact on its balance sheet. These benefits
of leasing would accrue to existing investors at the expense of new investors, who
would be deceived because the firm’s balance sheet did not reflect its true financial
leverage.
The question of whether investors were truly deceived was debated but never
resolved. Those who believed strongly in efficient markets thought investors were
not deceived and that footnotes were sufficient, while those who questioned market
efficiency thought all leases should be capitalized. Statement 13 represents a compro-
mise between these two positions, though one that is tilted heavily toward those who
favor capitalization.
A lease is classified as a capital lease—and hence must be capitalized and shown
directly on the balance sheet—if one or more of the following conditions exist.
4FASB Statement 13, “Accounting for Leases,” spells out in detail both the conditions under which the
lease must be capitalized and the procedures for capitalizing it. See also chapter 4 of Schallheim’s Lease or
Buy? (cited in footnote 1) for more on the accounting treatment of leases.
5There are, however, certain legal differences between loans and leases. In the event of liquidation in
bankruptcy, a lessor is entitled to take possession of the leased asset, and if the value of the asset is less
than the required payments under the lease, the lessor can enter a claim (as a general creditor) for 1 year’s
lease payments. Also, after bankruptcy has been declared but before the case has been resolved, lease
payments may be continued, whereas all payments on debts are generally stopped. In a reorganization,
the lessor receives the asset plus 3 years’ lease payments if needed to cover the value of the lease. The
lender under a secured loan arrangement has a security interest in the asset; this means that, if the asset
is sold, then the lender will be given the proceeds and the full unsatisfied portion of the lender’s claim
will be treated as a general creditor obligation. It is not possible to state, as a general rule, whether a
supplier of capital is in a stronger position as a secured creditor or as a lessor. However, in certain
situations, lessors may bear less risk than secured lenders if financial distress occurs.
Chapter 18: Lease Financing
739

1. Under the terms of the lease, ownership of the property is effectively transferred
from the lessor to the lessee.
2. The lessee can purchase the property at less than its true market value when the
lease expires.
3. The lease runs for a period equal to or greater than 75% of the asset’s life. Thus, if
an asset has a 10-year life and the lease is written for 8 years, the lease must be
capitalized.
4. The present value of the lease payments is equal to or greater than 90% of the
initial value of the asset.6
These rules, together with strong footnote disclosure rules for operating leases, were
supposed to be sufficient to ensure that no one would be fooled by lease financing.
Thus, leases should be regarded as debt for capital structure purposes, and they should
have the same effects as debt on rd and rs. Therefore, leasing is not likely to permit a
firm to use more financial leverage than could be obtained with conventional debt.

18.4 EVALUATION BY THE LESSEE
Leases are evaluated by both the lessee and the lessor. The lessee must determine
whether leasing an asset is less costly than buying it, and the lessor must decide
whether the lease payments provide a satisfactory return on the capital invested in
the leased asset. This section focuses on the lessee’s analysis.
In the typical case, the events leading to a lease arrangement follow the sequence
described below. We should note that a degree of uncertainty exists regarding the theo-
retically correct way to evaluate lease-versus-purchase decisions, and some very complex
decision models have been developed to aid in the analysis. However, the simple analysis
given here leads to the correct decision in all the cases we have ever encountered.
Off–Balance Sheet Financing: Is It Going to Disappear?
There is currently (mid-2009) a movement to standard-
ize global accounting regulations, with the IASB (Inter-
national Accounting Standards Board) and the FASB
working toward this goal. One element of any agree-
ment will be the treatment of leases. It appears likely
that the FASB and IASB will require all leases to be cap-
italized, even those that are now classified as operating
leases. This could have a huge impact on many compa-
nies’ financial statements. For example, Credit Suisse
estimated that the S&P 500 firms use about $369 billion
in assets that are in the form of operating leases. As
such, these are not shown as either assets or liabilities
and instead are off the balance sheets. Putting these
leases on the balance sheets by capitalizing them would
boost the average liabilities by about 2%, but the impact
would be much higher for some companies. This might
be painful for businesses, but it certainly would help in-
vestors identify a company’s obligations and liabilities.
6The discount rate used to calculate the present value of the lease payments must be the lower of (1) the
rate used by the lessor to establish the lease payments (this rate is discussed later in the chapter) or (2) the
rate of interest that the lessee would have to pay for new debt with a maturity equal to that of the lease.
Also, note that any maintenance payments embedded in the lease payment must be stripped out prior to
checking this condition.

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

1. When the firm decides to acquire a particular building or piece of equipment, the
decision is based on regular capital budgeting procedures. Whether or not to
acquire the asset is not part of the typical lease analysis—in a lease analysis, we are
concerned simply with whether to obtain the use of the machine by lease or by
purchase. Thus, for the lessee, the lease decision is typically just a financing
decision. However, if the effective cost of capital obtained by leasing is substan-
tially lower than the cost of debt, then the cost of capital used in the capital
budgeting decision would have to be recalculated, and perhaps projects formerly
deemed unacceptable might become acceptable. Such feedback effects usually are
very small and can safely be ignored.
2. Once the firm has decided to acquire the asset, the next question is how to finance
it. Well-run businesses do not have excess cash lying around, so capital to finance
new assets must be obtained from some source.
3. Funds to purchase the asset could be obtained from internally generated cash flows,
by borrowing, or by selling new equity. Alternatively, the asset could be leased.
Because of the capitalization/disclosure provision for leases, leasing normally has
the same capital structure effect as borrowing.
4. As indicated earlier, a lease is comparable to a loan in the sense that the firm is
required to make a specified series of payments, and a failure to meet these payments
could result in bankruptcy. If a company has a target capital structure, then $1 of lease
financing displaces $1 of debt financing. Thus, the most appropriate comparison is
lease financing versus debt financing. Note that the analysis should compare the cost
of leasing with the cost of debt financing regardless of how the asset purchase is actu-
ally financed. The asset may be purchased with available cash or with cash raised by
issuing stock, but since leasing is a substitute for debt financing and has the same
capital structure effect, the appropriate comparison would still be with debt financing.
To illustrate the basic elements of lease analysis, consider this simplified example.
(See Ch18 Tool Kit.xls on the textbook’s Web site for this analysis.) The Thompson-
Grammatikos Company (TGC) needs a 2-year asset that costs $100 million, and the
company must choose between leasing and buying the asset. TGC’s tax rate is 40%. If
the asset is purchased, the bank would lend TGC the $100 million at a rate of 10% on
a 2-year, simple interest loan. Thus, the firm would have to pay the bank $10 million in
interest at the end of each year and return the $100 million of principal at the end of
Year 2. For simplicity, assume that: (1) TGC could depreciate the asset over 2 years for
tax purposes by the straight-line method if it is purchased, resulting in tax depreciation
of $50 million and tax savings of T(Depreciation) = 0.4($50) = $20 million in each year;
and (2) the asset’s value at the end of 2 years will be $0.
Alternatively, TGC could lease the asset under a guideline lease (by a special
IRS ruling) for 2 years for a payment of $55 million at the end of each year.
The analysis for the lease-versus-borrow decision consists of (1) estimating the
cash flows associated with borrowing and buying the asset—that is, the flows
associated with debt financing; (2) estimating the cash flows associated with leas-
ing the asset; and (3) comparing the two financing methods to determine which
has the lower present value costs. Figure 18-1 reports the borrow-and-buy flows,
set up to produce a cash flow time line for owning option.
The net cash flow for owning is zero in Year 0, positive in Year 1, and negative in
Year 2. The operating cash flows are not shown, but they must, of course, have a PV
greater than the PV of the financing costs or else TGC would not want to acquire
the asset. Because the operating cash flows will be the same regardless of whether
the asset is leased or purchased, they can be ignored.

Chapter 18: Lease Financing
741

Figure 18-1 also shows the cash flows associated with leasing. Note that the two
sets of cash flows reflect the tax deductibility of interest and depreciation if the asset
is purchased or the deductibility of lease payments if it is leased. Thus, the net cash
flows include the tax savings from these items.7
To compare the cost streams of buying versus leasing, we must put them on a
present value basis. As we explain later, the correct discount rate is the after-tax
cost of debt, which for TGC is 10%(1 −0.4) = 6.0%. Applying this rate, we find
the present value of the ownership cash flows to be $63.33 million versus a present
value of leasing cash flows of $60.50 million. The cost of ownership and leasing are
the negatives of the PVs: The PVs are based on cash flows, and a cost is a negative
cash flow.
We define the net advantage to leasing (NAL) as follows:
NAL ¼ PV cost of owning −PV cost of leasing
(18-1)
For TGC, the NAL is $63.33 −$60.50 = $2.83 million.
Now we examine a more realistic example, one from the Anderson Company,
which is conducting a lease analysis on some assembly line equipment it will procure
during the coming year. (See Ch18 Tool Kit.xls on the textbook’s Web site for this
analysis.) The following data have been collected.

7If the lease had not met IRS guidelines, then ownership would effectively reside with the lessee, and
TGC would depreciate the asset for tax purposes whether it was leased or purchased. However, only the
implied interest portion of the lease payment would be tax deductible. Thus, the analysis for a nonguide-
line lease would consist of simply comparing the after-tax financing flows on the loan with the after-tax
lease payment stream.

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

1. Anderson plans to acquire automated assembly line equipment with a 10-year life
at a cost of $10 million, delivered and installed. However, Anderson plans to use
the equipment for only 5 years and then discontinue the product line.
2. Anderson can borrow the required $10 million at a pre-tax cost of 10%.
3. The equipment’s estimated scrap value is $50,000 after 10 years of use, but its
estimated salvage value after only 5 years of use is $2,000,000. Thus, if Anderson
buys the equipment, it would expect to receive $2,000,000 before taxes when the
equipment is sold in 5 years. In leasing, the asset’s value at the end of the lease is
called its residual value.
4. Anderson can lease the equipment for 5 years for an annual rental charge of
$2,600,000, payable at the beginning of each year, but the lessor will own the
equipment upon the expiration of the lease. (The lease payment schedule is es-
tablished by the potential lessor, as described in the next section, and Anderson
can accept it, reject it, or negotiate modifications.)
5. The lease contract stipulates that the lessor will maintain the equipment at no
additional charge to Anderson. However, if Anderson borrows and buys, it will
have to bear the cost of maintenance, which will be done by the equipment
manufacturer at a fixed contract rate of $500,000 per year, payable at the begin-
ning of each year.
6. The equipment falls in the MACRS 5-year class, Anderson’s marginal tax rate is
35%, and the lease qualifies as a guideline lease.
Figure 18-2 shows the steps involved in the analysis. Part I of the table is devoted to
the costs of borrowing and buying. The company borrows $10 million and uses it to pay
for the equipment, so these two items net out to zero and thus are not shown in the
figure. Then, the company makes the after-tax payments shown in Line 1. In Year 1, the
after-tax interest charge is 0.10($10 million)(0.65) = $650,000, and other payments are
calculated similarly. The $10 million loan is repaid at the end of Year 5. Line 2 shows
the maintenance cost. Line 3 gives the maintenance tax savings. Line 4 contains the
depreciation tax savings, which are the depreciation expenses multiplied by the tax rate.
The notes to Figure 18-2 explain the depreciation calculation. Lines 5 and 6 contain the
residual (or salvage) value cash flows. The tax is on the excess of the residual value over
the asset’s book value, not on the full residual value. Line 7 contains the net cash flows,
and Line 8 shows the net present value of these flows discounted at 6.5%. Line 9 re-
ports the cost of owning (which is the negative of the PV of cash flows).
Part II of Figure 18-2 analyzes the lease. The lease payments, shown in Line 10,
are $2,600,000 per year; this rate, which includes maintenance, was established by the
prospective lessor and offered to Anderson Equipment. If Anderson accepts the lease
then the full amount will be a deductible expense, so the tax savings, shown in Line
11, are 0.35(Lease payment) = 0.35($2,600,000) = $910,000. Thus, the after-tax cost
of the lease payment is Lease payment −Tax savings = $2,600,000 −$910,000 =
$1,690,000. This amount is shown in Line 12 for Years 0 through 4.
The next step is to compare the net cost of owning with the net cost of leasing. How-
ever, we must first put the annual cash flows of leasing and borrowing on a common
basis. This requires converting them to present values, which brings up the question of
the proper rate at which to discount the costs. Because leasing is a substitute for debt,
most analysts recommend that the company’s cost of debt be used, and this rate seems
reasonable in our example. Moreover, because the cash flows are after taxes, we should use
the after-tax cost of debt, which is 10%(1 −T) = 10%(0.65) = 6.5%. Accordingly, we
discount the net cash flows in Lines 7 and 12 using a rate of 6.5%. We then convert
the PVs to costs of owning and leasing, shown in Lines 9 and 14: The resulting present
Chapter 18: Lease Financing
743

values are $7,534,000 for the cost of owning and $7,480,000 for the cost of leasing. The
financing method that produces the smaller present value of costs is the one that should
be selected. Here the net advantage to leasing is
NAL ¼ PV cost of owning −PV cost of leasing
¼ $7;534; 000 −$7;480;000
¼ $54;000
The PV cost of owning exceeds the PV cost of leasing, so the NAL is positive.
Therefore, Anderson should lease the equipment.8
In this example, Anderson did not plan on using the equipment beyond Year 5. But if
Anderson instead had planned on using the equipment after Year 5, the analysis would
be modified. For example, suppose Anderson planned on using the equipment for 10
years and the lease allowed Anderson to purchase the equipment at the residual value.
First, how do we modify the cash flows due to owning? Lines 5 and 6 (for residual value
and tax on residual value) in Figure 18-2 will be zero at Year 5, because Anderson will

Notes:
(1) The after-tax loan payments consist of after-tax interest for Years 1–4 and after-tax interest plus the principal amount in Year 5.
(2) The net cash flows shown in Lines 7 and 11 are discounted at the lessee’s after-tax cost of debt, 6.5%.
(3) The MACRS depreciation allowances are 0.20, 0.32, 0.19, 0.12, and 0.11 in Years 1 through 5, respectively. Thus, the depreciation
expense is 0.20($10,000) = $2,000 in Year 1, and so on. The depreciation tax savings in each year is 0.35(Depreciation).
(4) The residual value is $2,000, while the book value is $600. Thus, Anderson would have to pay 0.35($2,000 −$600) = $490 in taxes, produc-
ing a net after-tax residual value of $2,000 −$490 = $1,510. These amounts are shown in Lines 5 and 6 in the cost-of-owning analysis.

8The more complicated methods that exist for analyzing leasing generally focus on the issue of what dis-
count rate should be used to discount the cash flows—especially the residual value, since its risk might be
different from the risk of the other cash flows. For more on residual value risk, see chapter 8 of Schall-
heim’s Lease or Buy? (cited in footnote 1).

not sell the equipment then.9 However, there will be the additional remaining year of
depreciation tax savings in Line 4 for Year 6. There will be no entries for Years 6–10
for Line 1, the after-tax loan payments, because the loan is completely repaid at Year 5.
Also, there will be no incremental maintenance costs and tax savings in Lines 2 and 3 for
Years 6–10, because Anderson will have to perform its own maintenance on the
equipment in those years whether it initially purchases the equipment or whether it
leases the equipment for 5 years and then purchases it. Either way, Anderson will own
the equipment in Years 6–10 and must pay for its own maintenance.
Second, how do we modify the cash flows if Anderson leases the equipment and
then purchases it at Year 5? There will be a negative cash flow at Year 5 reflecting
the purchase. Because the equipment was originally classified with a MACRS 5-year
life, Anderson will be allowed to depreciate the purchased equipment (even though it
is not new) with a MACRS 5-year life. Therefore, in Years 6–10, there will be after-
tax savings due to depreciation.10 Given the modified cash flows, we can calculate the
NAL just as we did in Figure 18-2.
In this section we focused on the dollar cost of leasing versus borrowing and buy-
ing, which is analogous to the NPV method used in capital budgeting. A second
method that lessees can use to evaluate leases focuses on the percentage cost of leas-
ing and is analogous to the IRR method used in capital budgeting.

18.5 EVALUATION BY THE LESSOR
Thus far, we have considered leasing only from the lessee’s viewpoint. It is also useful
to analyze the transaction as the lessor sees it: Is the lease a good investment for the
party who must put up the money? The lessor will generally be a specialized leasing
company, a bank or bank affiliate, an individual or group of individuals organized as a
limited partnership or limited liability corporation, or a manufacturer such as IBM or
GM that uses leasing as a sales tool. The specialized leasing companies are often
owned by profitable companies such as General Electric, which owns General Elec-
tric Capital, the largest leasing company in the world. Investment banking houses
such as Merrill Lynch also set up and/or work with specialized leasing companies,
where brokerage clients’ money is made available to leasing customers in deals that
permit the investors to share in tax shelters provided by leases.
Any potential lessor needs to know the rate of return on the capital invested in
the lease, and this information is also useful to the prospective lessee: Lease terms on
large leases are generally negotiated, so the lessee should know what return the lessor is
earning. The lessor’s analysis involves (1) determining the net cash outlay, which is usu-
ally the invoice price of the leased equipment less any lease payments made in advance;
(2) determining the periodic cash inflows, which consist of the lease payments minus
both income taxes and any maintenance expense the lessor must bear; (3) estimating the
after-tax residual value of the property when the lease expires; and (4) determining
whether the rate of return on the lease exceeds the lessor’s opportunity cost of capital
or, equivalently, whether the NPV of the lease exceeds zero.
9There might be a salvage value in Line 5 at Year 10 (and a corresponding tax adjustment in Line 6) if
the equipment is not completely worn out or obsolete.
10There will also be an after-tax cash flow at Year 10 that depends on the salvage value of the equipment
at that date.

Analysis by the Lessor
To illustrate the lessor’s analysis, we assume the same facts as for the Anderson Com-
pany lease, plus the following: (1) The potential lessor is a wealthy individual whose
current income is in the form of interest and whose marginal federal-plus-state
income tax rate, T, is 40%. (2) The investor can buy 5-year bonds that have a 9%
yield to maturity, providing an after-tax yield of (9%)(1 −T) = (9%)(0.6) = 5.4%.
This is the after-tax return the investor can obtain on alternative investments of sim-
ilar risk. (3) The before-tax residual value is $2,000,000. Because the asset will be
depreciated to a book value of $600,000 at the end of the 5-year lease, $1,400,000
of this $2 million will be taxable at the 40% rate by the depreciation recapture rule,
so the lessor can expect to receive $2,000,000 −0.4($1,400,000) = $1,440,000 after
taxes from the sale of the equipment after the lease expires.
The lessor’s cash flows are developed in Figure 18-3. Here we see that the lease as an
investment has a net present value of $81,000. On a present value basis, the investor who
invests in the lease rather than in the 9% bonds (5.4% after taxes) is better off by $81,000,
indicating that he or she should be willing to write the lease. As we saw earlier, the lease is
also advantageous to Anderson Company, so the transaction should be completed.
The investor can also calculate the lease investment’s internal rate of return based
on the net cash flows shown in Line 9 of Figure 18-3. The IRR of the lease, which is
that discount rate that forces the NPV of the lease to zero, is 5.8%. Thus, the lease
provides a 5.8% after-tax return to this 40% tax rate investor, which exceeds the
5.4% after-tax return on 9% bonds. So, using either the IRR or the NPV method,
the lease would appear to be a satisfactory investment.11

11Note that the lease investment is actually slightly more risky than the alternative bond investment be-
cause the residual value cash flow is less certain than a principal repayment. Thus, the lessor might re-
quire an expected return somewhat above the 5.4% promised on a bond investment.

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

Setting the Lease Payment
So far we have evaluated leases assuming that the lease payments have already been
specified. However, in large leases the parties generally sit down and work out an agree-
ment on the size of the lease payments, with these payments being set so as to provide
the lessor with some specific rate of return. In situations in which the lease terms are
not negotiated, which is often the case for small leases, the lessor must still go through
the same type of analysis, setting terms that provide a target rate of return and then
offering these terms to the potential lessee on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.
To illustrate all this, suppose the potential lessor described earlier, after examining
other alternative investment opportunities, decides that the 5.4% after-tax bond return
is too low to use for evaluating the lease and that the required after-tax return on the
lease should be 6.0%. What lease payment schedule would provide this return?
To answer this question, note again that Figure 18-3 contains the lessor’s cash
flow analysis. We used the Excel Goal Seek function to set the lessor’s IRR equal to
6% by changing the lease payment; see in the analysis in Ch18 Tool Kit.xls. We
found that the lessor must set the lease payment at $2,621,232 to obtain an after-tax
rate of return of 6.0%. If this lease payment is not acceptable to the lessee, Anderson
Company, then it may not be possible to strike a deal. Naturally, competition among
leasing companies forces lessors to build market-related returns into their lease
payment schedules.12
If the inputs to the lessee and the lessor are identical, then a positive NAL to the
lessee implies an equal but negative NPV to the lessor. However, conditions are often
such that leasing can provide net benefits to both parties. This situation arises because of
differentials in taxes, in borrowing rates, in estimated residual values, or in the ability to
bear the residual value risk. We will explore these issues in detail in the next section.
Note that the lessor can, under certain conditions, increase the return on the lease
by borrowing some of the funds used to purchase the leased asset. Such a lease is
called a leveraged lease. Whether or not a lease is leveraged has no effect on the
lessee’s analysis, but it can have a significant effect on the cash flows to the lessor
and hence on the lessor’s expected rate of return.

18.6 OTHER ISSUES IN LEASE ANALYSIS
The basic methods of analysis used by lessees and lessors were presented in the
previous sections. However, some other issues warrant discussion.13
Estimated Residual Value
It is important to note that the lessor owns the property upon expiration of a lease, so
the lessor has claim to the asset’s residual value. Superficially, it would appear that if
residual values are expected to be large, then owning would have an advantage over
leasing. However, this apparent advantage does not hold up. If expected residual

values are large—as they may be under inflation for certain types of equipment and
also if real estate is involved—then competition between leasing companies and other
financing sources, as well as competition among leasing companies themselves, will
force leasing rates down to the point where potential residual values are fully recog-
nized in the lease contract. Thus, the existence of large residual values is not likely to
result in materially higher costs for leasing.
Increased Credit Availability
As noted earlier, leasing is sometimes said to be advantageous for firms that are seek-
ing to increase their financial leverage. First, it is sometimes argued that firms can
obtain more money, and for longer terms, under a lease arrangement than under a
loan secured by a specific piece of equipment. Second, since some leases do not ap-
pear on the balance sheet, lease financing has been said to give the firm a stronger
appearance in a superficial credit analysis and thus to permit the firm to use more
leverage than would be possible if it did not lease.
There may be some truth to these claims for smaller firms. However, since firms are
required to capitalize financial leases and to report them on their balance sheets, this
point is of questionable validity for any firm large enough to have audited financial state-
ments. However, leasing can be a way to circumvent existing loan covenants. If restric-
tive covenants prohibit a firm from issuing more debt but fail to restrict lease payments,
then the firm could effectively increase its leverage by leasing additional assets. Also,
firms that are in poor financial condition and face possible bankruptcy may be able to
obtain lease financing at a lower cost than comparable debt financing because (1) lessors
What You Don’t Know Can Hurt You!
A leasing decision seems to be pretty straightforward, at
least from a financial perspective: Calculate the NAL for
the lease and undertake it if the NAL is positive. Right?
But tracking down all the financial implications from lease
contract provisions can be difficult, requiring the lessee to
make assumptions about future costs that are not explic-
itly spelled out in the lease contract. For example,
consider the purchase option embedded in the lease
that Rojacks Food Stores undertook with GE Capital for
restaurant equipment. Upon expiration, the lease allowed
Rojacks to either return the equipment or purchase it at
the current market value. When the lease expired, GE set
a purchase price that was much higher than Rojacks
expected. Rojacks needed the equipment for its day-
to-day operations so it couldn’t just return the equipment
without disrupting its business. Ultimately, Rojacks hired
an independent appraiser for the equipment and negoti-
ated a lower purchase price––but without the appraiser,
Rojacks would have been stuck with the price GE decided
to set for the equipment.
The Rojacks–GE situation isn’t that unusual. Les-
sors often use high expected residual values or high
expected penalties to offset low lease payments. In
addition, some contracts may require that (1) all of
the equipment covered under a lease must either be
purchased or returned in its entirety, (2) equipment
that is moved must be purchased, (3) large fees must
be paid even for minor damage or missing parts, and /
or (4) equipment must be returned in its original pack-
aging. These conditions impose costs on the lessee
when the lease is terminated and should be consid-
ered explicitly when making the leasing decision.
The moral of the story for lessees is to read the fine
print
and request
changes to objectionable
terms
before signing the lease. Here are some ways to reduce
the likelihood of unanticipated costs: (1) specify residual
value as a percentage of the initial cost of the equip-
ment; (2) allow for portions of the equipment to be
returned and portions to be purchased at the end of
the lease; and (3) specify that disagreements will be ad-
judicated by arbitration.

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

often have a more favorable position than lenders should the lessee actually go bankrupt,
and (2) lessors that specialize in certain types of equipment may be in a better position to
dispose of repossessed equipment than banks or other lenders.
Real Estate Leases
Most of our examples have focused on equipment leasing. However, leasing originated
with real estate, and such leases still constitute a huge segment of total lease financing.
(We distinguish between housing rentals and long-term business leases; our concern is
with business leases.) Retailers lease many of their stores. In some situations, retailers
have no choice but to lease—this is true of locations in malls and certain office build-
ings. In other situations, they have a choice of building and owning versus leasing. Law
firms and accounting firms, for example, can choose between buying their own facilities
or leasing on a long-term basis (up to 20 or more years).
The type of lease-versus-purchase analysis we discussed in this chapter is just as
applicable for real estate as for equipment—conceptually, there is no difference. Of
course, such things as maintenance, who the other tenants will be, what alterations
can be made, who will pay for alterations, and the like become especially important
with real property, but the analytical procedures upon which the lease-versus-buy
decision is based are no different from any other lease analysis.
Vehicle Leases
Vehicle leasing is very popular today both for large corporations and for individuals,
especially professionals such as MBAs, doctors, lawyers, and accountants. For
corporations, the key factor involved with transportation is often maintenance and
disposal of used vehicles—the leasing companies are specialists here, and many busi-
nesses prefer to “outsource” services related to autos and trucks. For individuals, leas-
ing is often more convenient, and it may be easier to justify tax deductions on leased
than on owned vehicles. Also, most auto leasing to individuals is through dealers.
These dealers (and manufacturers) use leasing as a sales tool, and they often make
the terms quite attractive—especially when it comes to the down payment, which
may be nonexistent in the case of a lease.
Vehicle leasing also permits many individuals to drive more expensive cars than
would otherwise be possible. For example, the monthly payment on a new BMW
might be $1,500 when financed with a 3-year loan, but the same car, if leased for 3
years, might cost only $749 a month. At first glance, it appears that leasing is less
expensive than owning because the monthly payment is so much lower. However,
such a simplistic analysis ignores the fact that payments end after the loan is paid
off but continue indefinitely under leasing. By using the techniques described in this
chapter, individuals can assess the true costs associated with auto leases and then
rationally judge the merits of each type of auto financing.
Leasing and Tax Laws14
The ability to structure leases that are advantageous to both lessor and lessee de-
pends in large part on tax laws. The four major tax factors that influence leasing
are (1) investment tax credits, (2) depreciation rules, (3) tax rates, and (4) the al-
ternative minimum tax. In this section, we briefly discuss each of these factors and
how they influence leasing decisions.
14See chapters 3 and 6 of Schallheim’s Lease or Buy? (cited in footnote 1) for an in-depth discussion of tax
effects on leasing.
Chapter 18: Lease Financing
749

The investment tax credit (ITC), when it is allowed, is a direct reduction of taxes
that occurs when a firm purchases new capital equipment. Prior to 1987, firms could
immediately deduct up to 10% of the cost of new capital investments from their cor-
porate tax bills. Thus, a company that bought a $1,000,000 mainframe computer sys-
tem would get a $100,000 reduction in current-year taxes. Because the ITC goes to
the owner of the capital asset, low-tax-bracket companies that could not otherwise
use the ITC could use leasing as a vehicle to pass immediate tax savings to
high–tax-bracket lessors. The ITC is not currently in effect, but it could be reinstated
in the future. If the ITC is put back into law, leasing will become especially attractive
to low-tax-bracket firms.
Owners recover their investments in capital assets through depreciation, which is a
tax-deductible expense. Because of the time value of money, the faster an asset can be
depreciated, the greater the tax advantages of ownership. Recent tax law changes have
tended to slow depreciation write-offs, thus reducing the value of ownership. This
has also reduced the advantage to leasing by low-tax-bracket lessees from high-
tax-bracket lessors. Any move to liberalize depreciation rules would tend to make
leasing more desirable in many situations. The value of depreciation also depends
on the firm’s tax rate, because the depreciation tax saving equals the amount of de-
preciation multiplied by the tax rate. Thus, higher corporate tax rates mean greater
ownership tax savings and hence more incentive for tax-driven leases.
Lease Securitization
Compared with many markets, the leasing market is frag-
mented and inefficient. There are millions of potential les-
sees, including all equipment users. Some are in high tax
brackets, some are in low brackets. Some are financially
sophisticated, some are not. Some have excellent credit
ratings, some have poor credit. On the other side of the
market are millions of potential lessors—including equip-
ment manufacturers, banks, and individual investors––
with different tax brackets and risk tolerances. If each les-
see had to negotiate a separate deal for each lease, then
information and search costs would be so high that few
leases would be written.
Tax laws complicate the picture. For example, the al-
ternative minimum tax (AMT) often has the effect of lim-
iting the amount of depreciation a firm can utilize. In
addition, a firm can’t take a full half-year’s depreciation
on purchases in the fourth quarter if those purchases
amount to more than 40% of total annual purchases. In
this case the firm can take only a half-quarter’s deprecia-
tion, which is the equivalent of one-eighth of a year’s
depreciation.
Lease brokers have for many years served as facili-
tators in this complicated and inefficient market. Work-
ing with many different equipment manufacturers and
lenders, brokers are in a position to match lessees with
appropriate lessors in such a way that the full benefit of
tax laws can be utilized.
Lease securitization, a new procedure, is the ulti-
mate method of matching lessees with appropriate les-
sors. The first step is to create a portfolio consisting of
numerous leases. The second step is to divide the leas-
ing cash flows into different streams of income, called
tranches. For example, one tranche might contain only
lease payments, which would appeal to an investor in a
low tax bracket. A second tranche might consist of
depreciation, which a high-tax-bracket investor could
use to shelter income from other sources. A third might
contain the residual cash flows, which will occur in the
future when the leases end. This tranche would appeal
to a high-tax-bracket investor who can take some risk.
Tranches can also be allocated according to the credit
rating of the lessees, allowing investors with different
risk tolerances to take on their desired level of risk.
In addition, a company might obtain a lease in its fourth
quarter, but if this is the third quarter of the lessor’s fiscal
year, the lessor can take a full half-year’s depreciation.
Sound complicated? It is, but it’s an efficient answer
to an inefficient market.

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

Finally, the alternative minimum tax (AMT) also affects leasing activity. Corpora-
tions are permitted to use accelerated depreciation and other tax shelters on their tax
books but then use straight-line depreciation for reporting results to shareholders.
Thus, some firms report to the IRS that they are doing poorly, and hence pay little
or no taxes, but report high earnings to shareholders. The corporate AMT, which is
roughly computed by applying a 20% tax rate to the profits reported to shareholders,
is designed to force highly profitable companies to pay at least some taxes even if
they have tax shelters that push their taxable income to zero. In effect, all firms (and
individuals) must compute the “regular” tax and the AMT tax, and then pay the
higher of the two.
Companies with large AMT liabilities look for ways to reduce their tax bills by low-
ering reported income. Leasing can be beneficial here—a relatively short-term lease
with high annual payments will increase reported expenses and thus lower reported
profits. Note that the lease does not have to qualify as a guideline lease and be deducted
for regular tax purposes—all that is needed is to lower reported income as shown on the
income statement.
We see that tax laws and differential tax rates between lessors and lessees can be a
motivating force for leasing. However, as we discuss in the next section, there are
some sound nontax economic reasons why firms lease plants and equipment.
Self-Test
Does leasing lead to increased credit availability?
How do tax laws affect leasing?
18.7 OTHER REASONS FOR LEASING
Up to this point, we have noted that tax rate or other differentials are generally nec-
essary to make leasing attractive to both the lessee and lessor. If the lessee and lessor
are facing different tax situations, including the alternative minimum tax, then it is
often possible to structure a lease that is beneficial to both parties. However, there
are other reasons that firms might want to lease an asset rather than buy it.
More than half of all commercial aircraft are leased, and smaller airlines, espe-
cially in developing nations, lease an especially high percentage of their planes.
One of the reasons for this is that airlines can reduce their risks by leasing. If an
airline purchased all its aircraft, it would be hampered in its ability to respond to
changing market conditions. Because they have become specialists at matching air-
lines with available aircraft, the aircraft lessors (which are multibillion-dollar con-
cerns) are quite good at managing the changing demand for different types of
aircraft. This permits them to offer attractive lease terms. In this situation, leasing
provides operating flexibility. Leasing is not necessarily less expensive than buying,
but the operating flexibility is quite valuable.
Leasing is also an attractive alternative for many high-technology items that are
subject to rapid and unpredictable technological obsolescence. Suppose a small
rural hospital wants to buy a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device. If it buys
the MRI equipment, then it is exposed to the risk of technological obsolescence. In
a short time some new technology might lower the value of the current system and
thus render the project unprofitable. Since it does not use much equipment of this
nature, the hospital would bear a great deal of risk if it bought the MRI device.
However, a lessor that specializes in state-of-the-art medical equipment would be
exposed to significantly less risk. By purchasing and then leasing many different
items, the lessor benefits from diversification. Of course, over time some items
will probably lose more value than the lessor expected, but this will be offset by
Chapter 18: Lease Financing
751

other items that retain more value than expected. Also, because such a leasing com-
pany will be especially familiar with the market for used medical equipment, it can
refurbish the equipment and then get a better price in the resale market than could
a remote rural hospital. For these reasons, leasing can reduce the risk of technolog-
ical obsolescence.
Leasing can also be attractive when a firm is uncertain about the demand for its
products or services and thus about how long the equipment will be needed. Again,
consider the hospital industry. Hospitals often offer services that are dependent on a
single staff member—for example, a physician who does liver transplants. To support
the physician’s practice, the hospital might have to invest millions in equipment that
can be used only for this particular procedure. The hospital will charge for the use of
the equipment, and if things go as expected, the investment will be profitable. How-
ever, if the physician leaves the hospital and if no replacement can be recruited, then
the project is dead and the equipment becomes useless to the hospital. In this case, a
lease with a cancellation clause would permit the hospital to simply return the equip-
ment. The lessor would charge something for the cancellation clause, and this would
lower the expected profitability of the project, but it would provide the hospital with
an option to abandon the equipment, and the value of the option could easily exceed
the incremental cost of the cancellation clause. The leasing company would be will-
ing to write this option because it is in a better position to remarket the equipment,
either by writing another lease or by selling it outright.
The leasing industry recently introduced a type of lease that even transfers some
of a project’s operating risk from the lessee to the lessor and also motivates the lessor
to maintain the leased equipment in good working order. Instead of making a fixed
rental payment, the lessee pays a fee each time the leased equipment is used. This
type of lease originated with copy machines, where the lessee pays so much per
month plus an additional amount per copy made. If the machine breaks down, no
copies are made and the lessor’s rental income declines. This motivates the lessor to
repair the machine quickly.
This type of lease is also used in the health care industry, where it is called a “per-
procedure lease.” For example, a hospital might lease an X-ray machine for a fixed fee
per X-ray, say, $5. If demand for the machine’s X-rays is less than expected by the hos-
pital, then revenues will be lower than expected but so will the machine’s capital costs.
Conversely, high demand would lead to higher than expected lease costs, but these
would be offset by higher than expected revenues. By using a per-procedure lease, the
hospital is converting a fixed cost for the equipment into a variable cost and thereby
reducing the machine’s operating leverage and break-even point. The net effect is to re-
duce the project’s risk. Of course, the expected cost of a per-procedure lease might be
more than the cost of a conventional lease, but the risk reduction benefit could be worth
the cost. Note too that if the lessor writes a large number of per-procedure leases then
much of the riskiness inherent in such leases can be eliminated by diversification, so the
risk premiums that lessors build into per-procedure lease payments could be low enough
to attract potential lessees.
Some companies also find leasing attractive because the lessor is able to provide
servicing on favorable terms. For example, Virco Manufacturing, a company that
makes school desks and other furniture, recently leased 25 truck tractors and 140
trailers that it uses to ship furniture from its plant. The lease agreement, with a large
leasing company that specializes in purchasing, maintaining, and then reselling
trucks, permitted the replacement of an aging fleet that Virco had built up over the
years. “We are pretty good at manufacturing furniture, but we aren’t very good at
maintaining a truck fleet,” said Virco’s CFO.

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

There are other reasons that might cause a firm to lease an asset rather than buy
it. Often these reasons are difficult to quantify and so cannot be easily incorporated
into an NPV or IRR analysis. Nevertheless, a sound lease decision must begin with a
quantitative analysis, and then qualitative factors can be considered before making
the final lease-or-buy decision.15

Describe some economic factors that might provide an advantage to leasing.
Summary
In the United States, more than 30% of all equipment is leased, as is a great deal of
real estate. Consequently, leasing is an important financing vehicle. In this chapter,
we discussed the leasing decision from the standpoints of both the lessee and lessor.
The key concepts covered are listed below.
•
The five most important types of lease agreement are the (1) operating lease;
(2) financial, or capital, lease; (3) sale-and-leaseback; (4) combination lease;
and (5) synthetic lease.
•
The IRS has specific guidelines that apply to lease arrangements. A lease that
meets these guidelines is called a guideline, or tax-oriented, lease, because the
IRS permits the lessor to deduct the asset’s depreciation and allows the lessee to
deduct the lease payments. A lease that does not meet the IRS guidelines is called
a non–tax-oriented lease, in which case ownership for tax purposes resides with
the lessee rather than the lessor.
•
FASB Statement 13 spells out the conditions under which a lease must be
capitalized (shown directly on the balance sheet) as opposed to shown only in
the notes to the financial statements. Generally, leases that run for a period equal
to or greater than 75% of the asset’s life must be capitalized.
•
The lessee’s analysis consists basically of a comparison of the PV of costs associ-
ated with leasing versus the PV of costs associated with owning. The difference
in these costs is called the net advantage to leasing (NAL).
•
One of the key issues in the lessee’s analysis is the appropriate discount rate. A lease
is a substitute for debt, cash flows in a lease analysis are stated on an after-tax basis,
and cash flows are known with relative certainty, so the appropriate discount rate is
the lessee’s after-tax cost of debt. A higher discount rate may be used on the re-
sidual value if it is substantially riskier than the other flows.
•
The lessor evaluates the lease as an investment. If the lease’s NPV is greater
than zero or if its IRR is greater than the lessor’s opportunity cost, then the lease
should be written.
•
Leasing is motivated by various differences between lessees and lessors. Three of
the most important reasons for leasing are (1) tax rate differentials, (2) leases in
which the lessor is better able than the lessee to bear the residual value risk, and
(3) situations in which the lessor can maintain the leased equipment more
efficiently than the lessee can.

(18–3)
Are lessees more likely to be in higher or lower income tax brackets than lessors?
(18–4)
Commercial banks moved heavily into equipment leasing during the early 1970s,
acting as lessors. One major reason for this invasion of the leasing industry was to
gain the benefits of accelerated depreciation and the investment tax credit on
leased equipment. During this same period, commercial banks were investing
heavily in municipal securities, and they were also making loans to real estate
investment trusts (REITs). In the mid-1970s, these REITs got into such serious
difficulty that many banks suffered large losses on their REIT loans. Explain how
its investments in municipal bonds and REITs could reduce a bank’s willingness to
act as a lessor.
(18–5)
One advantage of leasing voiced in the past is that it kept liabilities off the balance
sheet, thus making it possible for a firm to obtain more leverage than it otherwise
could have. This raised the question of whether or not both the lease obligation and
the asset involved should be capitalized and shown on the balance sheet. Discuss the
pros and cons of capitalizing leases and related assets.

The Randolph Teweles Company (RTC) has decided to acquire a new truck. One
alternative is to lease the truck on a 4-year guideline contract for a lease payment of
754
Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

$10,000 per year, with payments to be made at the beginning of each year. The lease
would include maintenance. Alternatively, RTC could purchase the truck outright for
$40,000, financing the purchase by a bank loan for the net purchase price and amor-
tizing the loan over a 4-year period at an interest rate of 10% per year. Under the
borrow-to-purchase arrangement, RTC would have to maintain the truck at a cost
of $1,000 per year, payable at year end. The truck falls into the MACRS 3-year class.
It has a residual value of $10,000, which is the expected market value after 4 years,
when RTC plans to replace the truck irrespective of whether it leases or buys. RTC
has a marginal federal-plus-state tax rate of 40%.
a. What is RTC’s PV cost of leasing?

Balance Sheet Effects
Reynolds Construction needs a piece of equipment that costs $200. Reynolds can
either lease the equipment or borrow $200 from a local bank and buy the equipment.
If the equipment is leased, the lease would not have to be capitalized. Reynolds’s bal-
ance sheet prior to the acquisition of the equipment is as follows:
Current assets
$300
Debt
$400
Net fixed assets
500
Equity
400
Total assets
$800
Total claims
$800
a. (1) What is Reynolds’s current debt ratio?
(2) What would be the company’s debt ratio if it purchased the equipment?
(3) What would be the debt ratio if the equipment were leased?
b. Would the company’s financial risk be different under the leasing and purchasing
alternatives?
(18–2)
Lease versus Buy
Consider the data in Problem 18-1. Assume that Reynolds’s tax rate is 40% and that
the equipment’s depreciation would be $100 per year. If the company leased the asset
on a 2-year lease, the payment would be $110 at the beginning of each year. If
Reynolds borrowed and bought, the bank would charge 10% interest on the loan.
In either case, the equipment is worth nothing after 2 years and will be discarded.
Should Reynolds lease or buy the equipment?

Big Sky Mining Company must install $1.5 million of new machinery in its Nevada
mine. It can obtain a bank loan for 100% of the purchase price, or it can lease the
machinery. Assume that the following facts apply.
(1) The machinery falls into the MACRS 3-year class.
(2) Under either the lease or the purchase, Big Sky must pay for insurance, property
taxes, and maintenance.
(3) The firm’s tax rate is 40%.
(4) The loan would have an interest rate of 15%.
(5) The lease terms call for $400,000 payments at the end of each of the next 4 years.
(6) Big Sky Mining has no use for the machine beyond the expiration of the lease, and the
machine has an estimated residual value of $250,000 at the end of the 4th year.

Lease versus Buy
Sadik Industries must install $1 million of new machinery in its Texas plant. It can
obtain a bank loan for 100% of the required amount. Alternatively, a Texas invest-
ment banking firm that represents a group of investors believes it can arrange for a
lease financing plan. Assume that the following facts apply.
(1) The equipment falls in the MACRS 3-year class.
(2) Estimated maintenance expenses are $50,000 per year.
(3) The firm’s tax rate is 34%.
(4) If the money is borrowed, the bank loan will be at a rate of 14%, amortized in
three equal installments at the end of each year.
(5) The tentative lease terms call for payments of $320,000 at the end of each year
for 3 years. The lease is a guideline lease.
(6) Under the proposed lease terms, the lessee must pay for insurance, property taxes,
and maintenance.
(7) Sadik must use the equipment if it is to continue in business, so it will almost cer-
tainly want to acquire the property at the end of the lease. If it does, then under
the lease terms it can purchase the machinery at its fair market value at that time.
The best estimate of this market value is $200,000, but it could be much higher
or lower under certain circumstances.
To assist management in making the proper lease-versus-buy decision, you are asked
to answer the following questions.
a. Assuming the lease can be arranged, should the firm lease or borrow and buy the
equipment? Explain. (Hint: In this situation, the firm plans to use the asset be-
yond the term of the lease. Thus, the residual value becomes a cost to leasing in
Year 3. The firm will depreciate the equipment it purchases under the purchase
option starting in Year 3, using the MACRS 3-year class schedule. Depreciation
will begin in the year in which the equipment is purchased, which is Year 3.)

b. Consider the $200,000 estimated residual value. Is it appropriate to discount it
at the same rate as the other cash flows? Are the other cash flows all equally
risky? (Hint: Riskier cash flows are normally discounted at higher rates, but
when the cash flows are costs rather than inflows, the normal procedure must be
reversed.)

Build a Model: Lessee’s
Analysis
Start with the partial model in the file Ch18 P06 Build a Model.xls on the textbook’s
Web site. As part of its overall plant modernization and cost reduction program,
Western Fabrics’s management has decided to install a new automated weaving
loom. In the capital budgeting analysis of this equipment, the IRR of the project
was found to be 20% versus the project’s required return of 12%.
The loom has an invoice price of $250,000, including delivery and installation
charges. The funds needed could be borrowed from the bank through a 4-year amor-
tized loan at a 10% interest rate, with payments to be made at the end of each year. In
the event the loom is purchased, the manufacturer will contract to maintain and service
it for a fee of $20,000 per year paid at the end of each year. The loom falls in the
MACRS 5-year class, and Western’s marginal federal-plus-state tax rate is 40%.
Aubey Automation Inc., maker of the loom, has offered to lease the loom to
Western for $70,000 upon delivery and installation (at t = 0) plus four additional an-
nual lease payments of $70,000 to be made at the end of Years 1 to 4. (Note that
there are five lease payments in total.) The lease agreement includes maintenance
and servicing. Actually, the loom has an expected life of 8 years, at which time its
expected salvage value is zero; however, after 4 years its market value is expected to
equal its book value of $42,500. Western plans to build an entirely new plant in 4
years, so it has no interest in either leasing or owning the proposed loom for more
than that period.
a. Should the loom be leased or purchased?
b. The salvage value is clearly the most uncertain cash flow in the analysis. What
effect would a salvage value risk adjustment have on the analysis? (Assume that
the appropriate salvage value pre-tax discount rate is 15%.)
c. Assuming that the after-tax cost of debt should be used to discount all anticipated cash
flows, at what lease payment would the firm be indifferent to either leasing or buying?
Mini Case
Lewis Securities Inc. has decided to acquire a new market data and quotation system for its
Richmond home office. The system receives current market prices and other information
from several online data services and then either displays the information on a screen or stores
it for later retrieval by the firm’s brokers. The system also permits customers to call up current
quotes on terminals in the lobby.
The equipment costs $1,000,000 and, if it were purchased, Lewis could obtain a term loan
for the full purchase price at a 10% interest rate. Although the equipment has a 6-year useful
life, it is classified as a special-purpose computer and therefore falls into the MACRS 3-year
class. If the system were purchased, a 4-year maintenance contract could be obtained at a cost
of $20,000 per year, payable at the beginning of each year. The equipment would be sold after
4 years, and the best estimate of its residual value is $200,000. However, because real-time dis-
play system technology is changing rapidly, the actual residual value is uncertain.

As an alternative to the borrow-and-buy plan, the equipment manufacturer informed Lewis
that Consolidated Leasing would be willing to write a 4-year guideline lease on the equip-
ment, including maintenance, for payments of $260,000 at the beginning of each year. Lewis’s
marginal federal-plus-state tax rate is 40%. You have been asked to analyze the lease-
versus-purchase decision and, in the process, to answer the following questions.
a. (1) Who are the two parties to a lease transaction?
(2) What are the five primary types of leases, and what are their characteristics?
(3) How are leases classified for tax purposes?
(4) What effect does leasing have on a firm’s balance sheet?
(5) What effect does leasing have on a firm’s capital structure?
b. (1) What is the present value cost of owning the equipment? (Hint: Set up a time line that
shows the net cash flows over the period t = 0 to t = 4, and then find the PV of these
net cash flows, or the PV cost of owning.)
(2) Explain the rationale for the discount rate you used to find the PV.
c. What is Lewis’s present value cost of leasing the equipment? (Hint: Again, construct a time
line.)
d. What is the net advantage to leasing (NAL)? Does your analysis indicate that Lewis should
buy or lease the equipment? Explain.
e. Now assume that the equipment’s residual value could be as low as $0 or as high as
$400,000 but $200,000 is the expected value. Since the residual value is riskier than the
other relevant cash flows, this differential risk should be incorporated into the analysis. De-
scribe how this could be accomplished. (No calculations are necessary, but explain how you
would modify the analysis if calculations were required.) What effect would the residual
value’s increased uncertainty have on Lewis’s lease-versus-purchase decision?
f. The lessee compares the cost of owning the equipment with the cost of leasing it. Now put
yourself in the lessor’s shoes. In a few sentences, how should you analyze the decision to
write or not to write the lease?
g. (1) Assume that the lease payments were actually $280,000 per year, that Consolidated Leas-
ing is also in the 40% tax bracket, and that it also forecasts a $200,000 residual value. Also,
to furnish the maintenance support, Consolidated would have to purchase a maintenance
contract from the manufacturer at the same $20,000 annual cost, again paid in advance.
Consolidated Leasing can obtain an expected 10% pre-tax return on investments of simi-
lar risk. What would be Consolidated’s NPV and IRR of leasing under these conditions?
(2) What do you think the lessor’s NPV would be if the lease payment were set at $260,000
per year? (Hint: The lessor’s cash flows would be a “mirror image” of the lessee’s cash
flows.)
h. Lewis’s management has been considering moving to a new downtown location, and they are
concerned that these plans may come to fruition prior to the equipment lease’s expiration. If
the move occurs then Lewis would buy or lease an entirely new set of equipment, so manage-
ment would like to include a cancellation clause in the lease contract. What effect would such a
clause have on the riskiness of the lease from Lewis’s standpoint? From the lessor’s standpoint?
If you were the lessor, would you insist on changing any of the other lease terms if a cancella-
tion clause were added? Should the cancellation clause contain provisions similar to call pre-
miums or any restrictive covenants and/or penalties of the type contained in bond indentures?

Hybrid Financing: Preferred
Stock, Warrants, and
Convertibles
T
he U.S. government’s responses to the global economic crisis are being
conducted through a wide variety of different programs administered by
the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, and the Congress. Each program has a different
emphasis, but many of the programs provide cash to troubled companies
in exchange for newly issued securities that are owned by the U.S.
government. In many cases, these securities have been preferred stock
and warrants that are convertible into common stock.
For example, the Treasury bought about $70 billion in preferred stock
from AIG, some of which was later converted to noncumulative preferred.
The Treasury bought preferred stock and warrants from hundreds of
financial institutions, including Bank of America, Citigroup, and JPMorgan
Chase. Some banks have repurchased the Treasury’s investments, but
there is still (mid-June 2009) about $128 billion outstanding.
The Treasury also made loans to GM ($21 billion), Chrysler ($15.5
billion), and other companies in the automotive industry. GM subsequently
filed for bankruptcy (June 1, 2009), with the U.S. government pledging to
put up another $30 billion. When the dust settles, the government is
expected to own 60% of the restructured GM’s common stock, plus an
additional $8.8 billion in debt and preferred stock.
Two questions arise. First, has the government made profitable
investments? The Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional
Oversight Panel each stated in 2009 that the answer is “no”: The Treasury
paid too much for the preferred stock and warrants it bought. On the other
hand, the U.S. financial system and economy have not (yet) collapsed as
badly as they did in the Great Depression, so perhaps the money was well-
spent.
Second, how much control will the government exert on the companies
in which it has invested? As we will describe later in the chapter, preferred
stock does not allow its owners to vote. This means that the government
does not have any direct representation on the bank boards in which it
invested. (This lack of control and access to information created public
759

outrage when AIG hosted a lavish retreat and when Merrill Lynch
executives were awarded enormous bonuses.) The government will
appoint the majority of GM’s new directors, but President Obama
indicated in late June 2009 that none of them will be government
employees. Again, it appears as if the government intends to behave as a
passive shareholder.
As you read this chapter, think about the government’s investments in
preferred stock and warrants, and decide for yourself whether they are
good investments.

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

In previous chapters, we examined common stocks and various types of long-term
debt. In this chapter, we examine three other securities used to raise long-term capital:
(1) preferred stock, which is a hybrid security that represents a cross between debt and
common equity, (2) warrants, which are derivative securities issued by firms to facili-
tate the issuance of some other type of security, and (3) convertibles, which combine
the features of debt (or preferred stock) and warrants.
19.1 PREFERRED STOCK
Preferred stock is a hybrid—it is similar to bonds in some respects and to common
stock in other ways. Accountants classify preferred stock as equity; hence they show it
on the balance sheet as an equity account. However, from a finance perspective pre-
ferred stock lies somewhere between debt and common equity: it imposes a fixed
charge and thus increases the firm’s financial leverage, yet omitting the preferred div-
idend does not force a company into bankruptcy. Also, unlike interest on debt, pre-
ferred dividends are not deductible by the issuing corporation, so preferred stock has
a higher cost of capital than does debt. We first describe the basic features of pre-
ferred stock, after which we discuss the types of preferred stock and the advantages
and disadvantages of preferred stock.
Basic Features
Preferred stock has a par (or liquidating) value, often either $25 or $100. The divi-
dend is stated as either a percentage of par, as so many dollars per share, or both
ways. For example, several years ago Klondike Paper Company sold 150,000 shares
of $100 par value perpetual preferred stock for a total of $15 million. This preferred
stock had a stated annual dividend of $12 per share, so the preferred dividend yield
was $12/$100 = 0.12, or 12%, at the time of issue. The dividend was set when
the stock was issued; it will not be changed in the future. Therefore, if the required
rate of return on preferred, rps, changes from 12% after the issue date—as it did—
then the market price of the preferred stock will go up or down. Currently, rps for
Klondike Paper’s preferred is 9%, and the price of the preferred has risen from
$100 to $12/0.09 = $133.33.
If the preferred dividend is not earned, the company does not have to pay it.
However, most preferred issues are cumulative, meaning that the cumulative total
of unpaid preferred dividends must be paid before dividends can be paid on the com-
mon stock. Unpaid preferred dividends are called arrearages. Dividends in arrears
do not earn interest; thus, arrearages do not grow in a compound interest sense,
they only grow from additional nonpayments of the preferred dividend. Also, many
preferred stocks accrue arrearages for only a limited number of years—so that, for
example, the cumulative feature may cease after 3 years. However, the dividends in
arrears continue in force until they are paid.
Preferred stock normally has no voting rights. However, most preferred issues
stipulate that the preferred stockholders can elect a minority of the directors—say,
three out of ten—if the preferred dividend is passed (omitted). Some preferreds
even entitle their holders to elect a majority of the board.
Although nonpayment of preferred dividends will not trigger bankruptcy, cor-
porations issue preferred stock with every intention of paying the dividend. Even
if passing the dividend does not give the preferred stockholders control of the com-
pany, failure to pay a preferred dividend precludes payment of common dividends.
In addition, passing the dividend makes it difficult to raise capital by selling bonds

and virtually impossible to sell more preferred or common stock except at rock-
bottom prices. However, having preferred stock outstanding does give a firm the
chance to overcome its difficulties: If bonds had been used instead of preferred
stock, a company could be forced into bankruptcy before it could straighten out
its problems. Thus, from the viewpoint of the issuing corporation, preferred stock is less
risky than bonds.
For an investor, however, preferred stock is riskier than bonds: (1) preferred
stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of bondholders in the event of liquida-
tion, and (2) bondholders are more likely to continue receiving income during hard
times than are preferred stockholders. Accordingly, investors require a higher after-
tax rate of return on a given firm’s preferred stock than on its bonds. However, since
70% of preferred dividends is exempt from corporate taxes, preferred stock is attrac-
tive to corporate investors. Indeed, high-grade preferred stock, on average, sells on a
lower pre-tax yield basis than high-grade bonds. As an example, Alcoa has preferred
stock with an annual dividend of $3.75 (a 3.75% rate applied to $100 par value). In
June 2009, Alcoa’s preferred stock had a price of $53.50, for a market yield of about
$3.75/$53.50 = 7.0%. Alcoa’s long-term bonds that mature in 2037 provided a yield
of 8.1%, which is 1.1 percentage points more than its preferred. The tax treatment
accounted for this differential; the after-tax yield to corporate investors was greater
on the preferred stock than on the bonds because 70% of the dividend may be
excluded from taxation by a corporate investor.1
About half of all preferred stock issued in recent years has been convertible into
common stock. We discuss convertibles in Section 19.3.
Some preferred stocks are similar to perpetual bonds in that they have no maturity
date, but most new issues now have specified maturities. For example, many pre-
ferred shares have a sinking fund provision that calls for the retirement of 2% of
the issue each year, meaning the issue will “mature” in a maximum of 50 years.
The Romance Had No Chemistry, But It Had a Lot of Preferred Stock!
On April 1, 2009, Dow Chemical Company merged with
Rohm & Haas after a bitter dispute over the interpreta-
tion of their previous merger agreement. So even
though the two companies make a lot of chemicals,
there apparently wasn’t much chemistry by the time
the merger was completed.
To raise cash for the $78.97 per share purchase of
Rohm & Haas’s outstanding shares, Dow borrowed
over $9 billion from Citibank and also issued $4 billion
in convertible preferred stock to Berkshire Hathaway
and The Kuwait Investment Authority.
The Haas Family Trusts and Paulson & Company
were large shareholders in Rohm & Haas. As part of
the deal, they sold their shares to Dow with one hand
and bought $3 billion in preferred stock from Dow with
the other. This preferred stock pays a cash dividend of
7%. It also pays an 8% “dividend” that can either be in
cash or in additional shares of the preferred stock, with
the choice left to Dow; this is called a payment-in-kind
(PIK) dividend.
These terms mean that Dow can conserve cash if it
runs into difficult times: Dow can pay the 8% in additional
stock and Dow can even defer payment of the 7% cash
dividend without risk of bankruptcy. But if this happens,
a troubled marriage is likely to cause even more grief.

1The after-tax yield on an 8.1% bond to a corporate investor in the 34% marginal tax rate bracket is
8.1%(1 −T) = 5.3%. The after-tax yield on a 7.0% preferred stock is 7.0%(1 −Effective T) = 7.0%
[1 −(0.30)(0.34)] = 6.3%. Also, note that tax law prevents arbitrage. If a firm issues debt and uses the
proceeds to purchase another firm’s preferred stock, then the 70% dividend exclusion is voided.

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

Also, many preferred issues are callable by the issuing corporation, which can also
limit the life of the preferred.2
Nonconvertible preferred stock is virtually all owned by corporations, which can
take advantage of the 70% dividend exclusion to obtain a higher after-tax yield on
preferred stock than on bonds. Individuals should not own preferred stocks (except
convertible preferreds)—they can get higher yields on safer bonds, so it is not logical
for them to hold preferreds.3 As a result of this ownership pattern, the volume of
preferred stock financing is geared to the supply of money in the hands of corporate
investors. When the supply of such money is plentiful, the prices of preferred stocks
are bid up, their yields fall, and investment bankers suggest that companies in need of
financing consider issuing preferred stock.
For issuers, preferred stock has a tax disadvantage relative to debt: Interest expense is
deductible, but preferred dividends are not. Still, firms with low tax rates may have an
incentive to issue preferred stock that can be bought by high–tax-rate corporate inves-
tors, who can take advantage of the 70% dividend exclusion. If a firm has a lower tax
rate than potential corporate buyers, then the firm might be better off issuing preferred
stock than debt. The key here is that the tax advantage to a high–tax-rate corporation is
greater than the tax disadvantage to a low–tax-rate issuer. As an illustration, assume that
risk differentials between debt and preferred would require an issuer to set the interest
rate on new debt at 10% and the dividend yield on new preferred stock 2% higher, or
at 12% in a no-tax world. However, when taxes are considered, a corporate buyer with
a high tax rate—say, 40%—might be willing to buy the preferred stock if it has an 8%
before-tax yield. This would produce an 8%(1 −Effective T) = 8%[1 −0.30(0.40)] =
7.04% after-tax return on the preferred versus 10%(1 −0.40) = 6.0% on the debt. If
the issuer has a low tax rate—say, 10%—then its after-tax costs would be 10%(1 −T) =
10%(0.90) = 9% on the bonds and 8% on the preferred. Thus, the security with lower
risk to the issuer, preferred stock, also has a lower cost. Such situations can make pre-
ferred stock a logical financing choice.4
Other Types of Preferred Stock
In addition to “plain vanilla” preferred stock, there are two other variations: adjust-
able rate and market auction preferred stock.
Adjustable Rate Preferred Stock.
Instead of paying fixed dividends, adjustable
rate preferred stocks (ARPs) have their dividends tied to the rate on Treasury
securities. ARPs are issued mainly by utilities and large commercial banks. When
2Prior to the late 1970s, virtually all preferred stock was perpetual and almost no issues had sinking funds
or call provisions. Then insurance company regulators, worried about the unrealized losses the companies
had been incurring on preferred holdings as a result of rising interest rates, made changes essentially man-
dating that insurance companies buy only limited life preferreds. From that time on, virtually no new pre-
ferred has been perpetual. This example illustrates the way securities change as a result of changes in the
economic environment.
3Some financially engineered preferred stock has “dividends” that the paying company can deduct for tax
purposes in the same way that interest payments are deductible. Therefore, the company is able to pay a
higher rate on such preferred stock, making it potentially attractive to individual investors. These securi-
ties trade under a variety of colorful names, including MIPS (Modified Income Preferred Securities),
QUIPS (Quarterly Income Preferred Securities), TOPrS (Trust Originated Preferred Stock), and QUIDS
(Quarterly Income Debt Securities).

R. Fraser, “Financial Innovations and Excesses Revisited: The Case of Auction Rate Preferred Stock,”
Financial Management, Summer 1993, pp. 61–75.

ARPs were first developed, they were touted as nearly perfect short-term corporate
investments because (1) only 30% of the dividends are taxable to corporations, and
(2) the floating-rate feature was supposed to keep the issue trading at near par. The
new security proved to be so popular as a short-term investment for firms with idle
cash that mutual funds designed just to invest in them sprouted like weeds (and
shares of these funds, in turn, were purchased by corporations). However, the ARPs
still had some price volatility due to (1) changes in the riskiness of the issuers (some
big banks that had issued ARPs, such as Continental Illinois, ran into serious loan
default problems) and (2) fluctuations in Treasury yields between dividend rate ad-
justment dates. Therefore, the ARPs had too much price instability to be held in
the liquid asset portfolios of many corporate investors.
Market Auction Preferred Stock.
In 1984, investment bankers introduced
money market, or market auction, preferred.5 Here the underwriter conducts an
auction on the issue every 7 weeks (to get the 70% exclusion from taxable income,
buyers must hold the stock for at least 46 days). Holders who want to sell their shares
can put them up for auction at par value. Buyers then submit bids in the form of
the yields they are willing to accept over the next 7-week period. The yield set on
the issue for the coming period is the lowest yield sufficient to sell all the shares be-
ing offered at that auction. The buyers pay the sellers the par value; hence holders
are virtually assured that their shares can be sold at par. The issuer then must pay
a dividend rate over the next 7-week period as determined by the auction. From
the holder’s standpoint, market auction preferred is a low-risk, largely tax-exempt,
7-week maturity security that can be sold between auction dates at close to par.
In practice, things may not go quite so smoothly. If there are few potential buyers,
then an excessively high yield might be required to clear the market. To protect the
issuing firms or mutual funds from high dividend payments, the securities have a cap
on the allowable dividend yield. If the market-clearing yield is higher than this cap
then the next dividend yield will be set equal to this cap rate, but the auction will
fail and the owners of the securities who wish to sell will not be able to do so. This
happened in February 2008, and many market auction preferred stockholders were
left holding securities they wanted to liquidate.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Preferred Stock
There are both advantages and disadvantages to financing with preferred stock. Here
are the major advantages from the issuer’s standpoint.
1. In contrast to bonds, the obligation to pay preferred dividends is not firm, and
passing (not paying) a preferred dividend cannot force a firm into bankruptcy.
2. By issuing preferred stock, the firm avoids the dilution of common equity that
occurs when common stock is sold.
3. Since preferred stock sometimes has no maturity and since preferred sinking
fund payments (if present) are typically spread over a long period, preferred
issues reduce the cash flow drain from repayment of principal that occurs with
debt issues.
There are two major disadvantages, as follows.
1. Preferred stock dividends are not normally deductible to the issuer, so the after-
tax cost of preferred is typically higher than the after-tax cost of debt. However,
5Confusingly, market auction preferred stock is frequently referred to as auction-rate preferred stock and
with the acronym ARP as well.
764
Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

the tax advantage of preferreds to corporate purchasers lowers its pre-tax cost and
thus its effective cost.
2. Although preferred dividends can be passed, investors expect them to be paid
and firms intend to pay them if conditions permit. Thus, preferred dividends are
considered to be a fixed cost. As a result, their use—like that of debt—increases
financial risk and hence the cost of common equity.

19.2 WARRANTS
A warrant is a certificate issued by a company that gives the holder the right to buy a
stated number of shares of the company’s stock at a specified price for some specified
length of time. Generally, warrants are issued along with debt, and they are used to
induce investors to buy long-term debt with a lower coupon rate than would other-
wise be required. For example, when Infomatics Corporation, a rapidly growing
high-tech company, wanted to sell $50 million of 20-year bonds in 2010, the com-
pany’s investment bankers informed the financial vice president that the bonds would
be difficult to sell and that a coupon rate of 10% would be required. However, as an
alternative the bankers suggested that investors might be willing to buy the bonds
with a coupon rate of only 8% if the company would offer 20 warrants with each
$1,000 bond, each warrant entitling the holder to buy one share of common stock
at a strike price (also called an exercise price) of $22 per share. The stock was selling
for $20 per share at the time, and the warrants would expire in the year 2020 if they
had not been exercised previously.
Why would investors be willing to buy Infomatics’s bonds at a yield of only 8% in a
10% market just because warrants were also offered as part of the package? It’s because
the warrants are long-term call options that have value, since holders can buy the firm’s
common stock at the strike price regardless of how high the market price climbs. This
option offsets the low interest rate on the bonds and makes the package of low-yield
bonds plus warrants attractive to investors. (See Chapter 8 for a discussion of options.)
Initial Market Price of a Bond with Warrants
If the Infomatics bonds had been issued as straight debt, they would have carried a 10%
interest rate. However, with warrants attached, the bonds were sold to yield 8%. Some-
one buying the bonds at their $1,000 initial offering price would thus be receiving a
package consisting of an 8%, 20-year bond plus 20 warrants. Because the going interest
rate on bonds as risky as those of Infomatics was 10%, we can find the straight-debt
value of the bonds, assuming an annual coupon for ease of illustration, as follows:

Using a financial calculator, input N = 20, I/YR = 10, PMT = 80, and FV = 1000.
Then press the PV key to obtain the bond’s value of $829.73, or approximately
$830. Thus, a person buying the bonds in the initial underwriting would pay $1,000
and receive in exchange a straight bond worth about $830 plus 20 warrants that are
presumably worth about $1,000 −$830 = $170:
Price paid for
bond with warrants ¼
Straight-debt
value of bond þ Value of
warrants
(19-1)
$1;000 ¼ $830 þ $170
Because investors receive 20 warrants with each bond, each warrant has an implied
value of $170/20 = $8.50.
The key issue in setting the terms of a bond-with-warrants deal is valuing the war-
rants. The straight-debt value can be estimated quite accurately, as we have shown.
However, it is more difficult to estimate the value of the warrants. The Black-
Scholes option pricing model (OPM), discussed in Chapter 8, can be used to find
the value of a call option. There is a temptation to use this model to find the value
of a warrant, since call options are similar to warrants in many respects: Both give the
investor the right to buy a share of stock at a fixed strike price on or before the expi-
ration date. However, there are major differences between call options and warrants.
When call options are exercised, the stock provided to the option holder comes from
the secondary market, but when warrants are exercised, the stock provided to the
warrant holders is either newly issued shares or treasury stock the company has pre-
viously purchased. This means that the exercise of warrants dilutes the value of the
original equity, which could cause the value of the original warrant to differ from
the value of a similar call option. Also, call options typically have a life of just a few
months, whereas warrants often have lives of 10 years or more. Finally, the Black-
Scholes model assumes that the underlying stock pays no dividend, which is not
unreasonable over a short period but is unreasonable for 5 or 10 years. Therefore,
investment bankers cannot use the original Black-Scholes model to determine the
value of warrants.
Even though the original Black-Scholes model cannot be used to determine a precise
value for a warrant, there are more sophisticated models that work reasonably well.6
In addition, investment bankers can simply contact portfolio managers of mutual
funds, pension funds, and other organizations that would be interested in buying the se-
curities to get an indication of how many they would buy at different prices. In effect,
the bankers hold a presale auction and determine the set of terms that will just clear
6For example, see John C. Hull, Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives, 7th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ:
Prentice-Hall, 2009). Hull shows that if there are m warrants outstanding, each of which can be converted
into γ shares of common stock at an exercise price of X, as well as n shares of common stock outstanding,
then the price ω of a warrant is given by this modification of the Black-Scholes option pricing formula

lative normal distribution function. See Chapter 8 for more on the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. If
γ = 1 and n is very much larger than m, so that the number of warrants issued is very small compared to
the number of shares of stock outstanding, then this simplifies to the standard Black-Scholes option pricing
formula.

the market. If they do this job properly then they will, in effect, be letting the market
determine the value of the warrants.
Use of Warrants in Financing
Warrants generally are used by small, rapidly growing firms as sweeteners when
they sell debt or preferred stock. Such firms frequently are regarded by investors as
being highly risky, so their bonds can be sold only at extremely high coupon rates
and with very restrictive indenture provisions. To avoid such restrictions, firms like
Infomatics often offer warrants along with the bonds.
Getting warrants along with bonds enables investors to share in the company’s
growth, assuming it does in fact grow and prosper. Therefore, investors are willing
to accept a lower interest rate and less restrictive indenture provisions. A bond with
warrants has some characteristics of debt and some characteristics of equity. It is a
hybrid security that provides the financial manager with an opportunity to expand
the firm’s mix of securities and thereby appeal to a broader group of investors.
Virtually all warrants issued today are detachable. In other words, after a bond
with attached warrants is sold, the warrants can be detached and traded separately
from the bond. Further, even after the warrants have been exercised, the bond (with
its low coupon rate) remains outstanding.
The strike price on warrants is generally set some 20% to 30% above the market
price of the stock on the date the bond is issued. If the firm grows and prospers, caus-
ing its stock price to rise above the strike price at which shares may be purchased, then
warrant holders could exercise their warrants and buy stock at the stated price. How-
ever, without some incentive, warrants would never be exercised prior to maturity—
their value in the open market would be greater than their value if exercised, so holders
would sell warrants rather than exercise them. There are three conditions that cause
holders to exercise their warrants: (1) Warrant holders will surely exercise and buy
stock if the warrants are about to expire and the market price of the stock is above
the exercise price. (2) Warrant holders will exercise voluntarily if the company raises
the dividend on the common stock by a sufficient amount. No dividend is earned
on the warrant, so it provides no current income. However, if the common stock pays
a high dividend, then it provides an attractive dividend yield but limits stock price
growth. This induces warrant holders to exercise their option to buy the stock. (3) War-
rants sometimes have stepped-up strike prices (also called stepped-up exercise prices),
which prod owners into exercising them. For example, Williamson Scientific Company
has warrants outstanding with a strike price of $25 until December 31, 2014, at which
time the strike price rises to $30. If the price of the common stock is over $25 just
before December 31, 2014, many warrant holders will exercise their options before the
stepped-up price takes effect and the value of the warrants falls.
Another desirable feature of warrants is that they generally bring in funds only if
funds are needed. If the company grows, it will probably need new equity capital. At
the same time, growth will cause the price of the stock to rise and the warrants to be
exercised; hence the firm will obtain the cash it needs. If the company is not successful
and it cannot profitably employ additional money, then the price of its stock will prob-
ably not rise enough to induce exercise of the warrants.
The Component Cost of Bonds with Warrants
When Infomatics issued its bonds with warrants, the firm received $1,000 for each
bond. The pre-tax cost of debt would have been 10% if no warrants had been attached,
but each Infomatics bond has 20 warrants, each of which entitles its holder to buy one
Chapter 19: Hybrid Financing: Preferred Stock, Warrants, and Convertibles
767

share of stock for $22. The presence of warrants also allows Infomatics to pay only 8%
interest on the bonds, obligating it to pay $80 interest for 20 years plus $1,000 at the
end of 20 years. What is the percentage cost of each $1,000 bond with warrants? As we
shall see, the cost is well above the 8% coupon rate on the bonds.
The best way to approach this analysis is to break the $1,000 into two compo-
nents, one consisting of an $830 bond and the other consisting of $170 of warrants.
Thus, the $1,000 bond-with-warrants package consists of $830/$1,000 = 0.83 = 83%
straight debt and $170/$1,000 = 0.17 = 17% warrant. Our objective is to find the cost
of capital for the straight bonds and the cost of capital for the warrant, then weight
them to derive the cost of capital for the bond-with-warrants package.
The pre-tax cost of debt is 10% because this is the pre-tax cost of debt for a
straight bond, so our task is to estimate the cost of capital for a warrant. Estimating
the cost of capital for a warrant is fairly complicated, but we can use the following
procedure to obtain a reasonable approximation.7 The basic idea is to estimate the
firm’s expected cost of satisfying the warrant holders at the time the warrants
expire. To do this, we need to estimate the value the firm, the value of the debt, the
intrinsic value of equity, and the stock price at the time of expiration.
Assume that the total value of Infomatics’s operations and investments, which is
$250 million immediately after issuing the bonds with warrants, is expected to grow
at 9% per year. When the warrants are due to expire in 10 years, the total value of
Infomatics is expected to be $250(1.09)10 = $591.841 million.
Infomatics will receive $22 per warrant when exercised; with 1 million warrants,
this results in a cash flow to Infomatics of $22 million. The total value of Infomatics
will be equal to the value of operations plus the value of this cash. This will make the
total value of Infomatics equal to $591.841 + $22 = $613.841 million.
When the warrants expire, the bonds will have 10 years remaining until maturity
with a fixed coupon payment of $80. If the expected market interest rate is still 10%,
then the time line of cash flows will be

Using a financial calculator, input N = 10, I/YR = 10, PMT = 80, and FV = 1000;
then press the PV key to obtain the bond’s value, $877.11. The total value of all of
the bonds is 50,000($877.11) = $43.856 million.
The intrinsic value of equity is equal to the total value of the firm minus the value
of debt: $613.841 −$43.856 = $569.985 million.
Infomatics had 10 million shares outstanding prior to the warrants’ exercise, so it
will have 11 million after the 1 million options are exercised. The previous warrant
holders will now own 1/11 of the equity, for a total of $569.985(1/11) = $51.82
million dollars. We can also estimate the predicted intrinsic stock price, which is
equal to the intrinsic value of equity divided by the number of shares: $569.985/11 =
$51.82 per share.8 These calculations are summarized in Table 19-1.
7For an exact solution, see P. Daves and M. Ehrhardt, “Convertible Securities, Employee Stock Options,
and the Cost of Equity,” The Financial Review, Vol. 42, 2007, pp. 267–288.
8If the stock price had been less than the strike price of $22 at expiration, then the warrants would not
have been exercised. Based on the expected growth in the firm’s value, there is little chance that the stock
price will not be greater than $22.

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

To find the component cost of the warrants, consider that Infomatics will have to
issue one share of stock worth $51.82 for each warrant exercised and, in return,
Infomatics will receive the strike price, $22. Thus, a purchaser of the bonds with
warrants, if she holds the complete package, would expect to realize a profit in Year
10 of $51.82 −$22 = $29.82 for each warrant exercised.9 Since each bond has 20 war-
rants attached and since each warrant entitles the holder to buy one share of common
stock, it follows that warrant holders will have an expected cash flow of 20($29.82) =
$596.40 per bond at the end of Year 10. Here is a time line of the expected cash flow

The IRR of this stream is 13.35%, which is an approximation of the warrant
holder’s expected return on the warrants (rw) in the bond with warrants. The overall
pre-tax cost of capital for the bonds with warrants is the weighted average of the cost
of straight debt and the cost of warrants:

The cost of the warrants is higher than the cost of debt because warrants are
riskier than debt; in fact, the cost of warrants is greater than the cost of equity
because warrants also are riskier than equity. Thus, the cost of capital for a bond

bThe warrants will be exercised only if the stock price at expiration is above $22. If the stock price is
less than $22, then the warrants will expire worthless and there will be no new capital. Our calculations
show that the expected stock price is much greater than $22, so the warrants are expected to be
exercised.
cBefore the warrants are exercised, there are 10 million shares of stock. After the warrants are
exercised, there will be 10 + 1 = 11 million shares outstanding.
9It is not strictly accurate to say that the expected profit from the warrant position is the expected stock
price less the strike price: $29.82 = $51.82 −$22. This is because if the stock price drops below the strike
price, in this case $22, then the warrant profit is $0, regardless of how low the stock price goes. Thus the
expected payoff will be somewhat more than $29.82. Although this expectation can be calculated using
options techniques similar to those in Chapter 8, it is beyond the scope of this chapter. However, if there
is a very small probability that the stock price will drop below the exercise price, then $29.82 is very close
to the true expected payoff.

with warrants is weighted between the cost of debt and the much higher cost of
equity. This means the overall cost of capital for the bonds with warrants will be
greater than the cost of straight debt and will be much higher than the 8% coupon
rate on the bonds-with-warrants package.10
Bonds with warrants and preferred stock with warrants have become an important
source of funding for companies during the global economic crisis. But as our example
shows, this form of financing has a much higher cost of capital than its low coupon and
preferred dividend might lead you to think.11

19.3 CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES
Convertible securities are bonds or preferred stocks that, under specified terms and
conditions, can be exchanged for (that is, converted into) common stock at the option
of the holder. Unlike the exercise of warrants, which brings in additional funds to the
firm, conversion does not provide new capital; debt (or preferred stock) is simply
replaced on the balance sheet by common stock. Of course, reducing the debt or
preferred stock will improve the firm’s financial strength and make it easier to raise
additional capital, but that requires a separate action.
Conversion Ratio and Conversion Price
The conversion ratio, CR, for a convertible security is defined as the number of
shares of stock a bondholder will receive upon conversion. The conversion price, Pc,
is defined as the effective price investors pay for the common stock when conversion
occurs. The relationship between the conversion ratio and the conversion price can
10In order to estimate the after-tax cost of capital, the after-tax cost of each component must be esti-
mated. The after-tax cost of the warrant is the same as the pre-tax cost because warrants do not affect
the issuer’s tax liability. This is not true for the bond component. Because the straight bond is worth
only $830 at the time of issue, it has an original issue discount (OID). This means that the after-tax cost
of debt is not exactly equal to rd(1 −T). For long-term bonds, such as the one in this example, the differ-
ence is small enough to be neglected. See Web Extension 5A on the textbook’s Web site for a general
discussion of the after-tax cost of debt for zero coupon bonds and OID bonds. The Ch19 Tool Kit.xls
calculates the after-tax cost of Infomatics’ bond component, which is 6.3% rather than 10%(1 −0.40) =
6%, assuming a 40% tax rate.

be illustrated by Silicon Valley Software Company’s convertible debentures issued at
their $1,000 par value in July of 2010. At any time prior to maturity on July 15, 2030,
a debenture holder can exchange a bond for 18 shares of common stock. Therefore,
the conversion ratio, CR, is 18. The bond cost a purchaser $1,000, the par value,
when it was issued. Dividing the $1,000 par value by the 18 shares received gives a
conversion price of $55.56 a share:
Conversion price ¼ Pc ¼ Par value of bond given up
Shares received
(19-2)
¼ $1;000
CR
¼ $1;000
18
¼ $55:56
Conversely, by solving for CR, we obtain the conversion ratio:
Conversion ratio ¼ CR ¼ $1;000
Pc
(19-3)
¼ $1;000
$55:56 ¼ 18 shares
Once CR is set, the value of Pc is established, and vice versa.
Like a warrant’s exercise price, the conversion price is typically set some 20% to
30% above the prevailing market price of the common stock on the issue date. Gener-
ally, the conversion price and conversion ratio are fixed for the life of the bond,
although sometimes a stepped-up conversion price is used. For example, the 2010 con-
vertible debentures for Breedon Industries are convertible into 12.5 shares until 2019,
into 11.76 shares from 2020 until 2030, and into 11.11 shares from 2030 until maturity
in 2040. The conversion price thus starts at $80, rises to $85, and then goes to $90.
Breedon’s convertibles, like most, have a 10-year call-protection period.
Another factor that may cause a change in the conversion price and ratio is a stan-
dard feature of almost all convertibles—the clause protecting the convertible against
dilution from stock splits, stock dividends, and the sale of common stock at prices
below the conversion price. The typical provision states that if common stock is sold
at a price below the conversion price, then the conversion price must be lowered (and
the conversion ratio raised) to the price at which the new stock was issued. Also, if the
stock is split or if a stock dividend is declared, the conversion price must be lowered by
the percentage amount of the stock dividend or split. For example, if Breedon Indus-
tries were to have a 2-for-1 stock split during the first 10 years of its convertible’s life,
then the conversion ratio would automatically be adjusted from 12.5 to 25 and the
conversion price lowered from $80 to $40. If this protection were not contained in
the contract, then a company could completely thwart conversion by the use of stock
splits and stock dividends. Warrants are similarly protected against dilution.
However, this standard protection against dilution from selling new stock at prices
below the conversion price can get a company into trouble. For example, assume that
Breedon’s stock was selling for $65 per share at the time the convertible was issued.
Then suppose that the market went sour and that Breedon’s stock price dropped to
$30 per share. If Breedon needed new equity to support operations, a new common
stock sale would require the company to lower the conversion price on the convertible
debentures from $80 to $30. That would raise the value of the convertibles and, in

effect, transfer wealth from current shareholders to the convertible holders. This trans-
fer would amount to a de facto additional flotation cost on the new common stock. Po-
tential problems such as this must be kept in mind by firms considering the use of
convertibles or bonds with warrants.
The Component Cost of Convertibles
In the spring of 2010, Silicon Valley Software was evaluating the use of the con-
vertible bond issue described earlier. The issue would consist of 20-year convertible
bonds that would sell at a price of $1,000 per bond; this $1,000 would also be the
bond’s par (and maturity) value. The bonds would pay an 8% annual coupon inter-
est rate, which is $80 per year. Each bond would be convertible into 18 shares of
stock, so the conversion price would be $1,000/18 = $55.56. The stock was ex-
pected to pay a dividend of $1.40 during the coming year, and it sold at $35 per
share. Further, the stock price was expected to grow at a constant rate of 9% per
year. Therefore, ^rs = D1/P0 + g = $1.40/$35 + 9% = 4% + 9% = 13%. If the bonds
were not made convertible then they would have to provide a yield of 10%, given
their risk and the general level of interest rates. The convertible bonds would not
be callable for 10 years, after which they could be called at a price of $1,050, with
this price declining by $5 per year thereafter. If, after 10 years, the conversion value
exceeded the call price by at least 20%, management would probably call the bonds.
Figure 19-1 shows the expectations of both an average investor and the company.
Refer to the figure as you consider the following points.
1. The horizontal dashed line at $1,000 represents the par (and maturity) value.
Also, $1,000 is the price at which the bond is initially offered to the public.
2. The bond is protected against a call for 10 years. It is initially callable at a price
of $1,050, and the call price declines thereafter by $5 per year, as shown by the
pink line in Figure 19-1.
3. Since the convertible has an 8% coupon rate and since the yield on a nonconvert-
ible bond of similar risk is 10%, it follows that the expected “straight-bond” value
of the convertible, Bt, must be less than par. At the time of issue and assuming an
annual coupon, B0 is $830:

Note, however, that the bond’s straight-debt value must be $1,000 at maturity,
so the straight-debt value rises over time; this is plotted by the brown line in
Figure 19-1.
4. The bond’s initial conversion value, Ct, or the value of the stock an investor would
receive if the bonds were converted at t = 0, is P0(CR) = $35(18 shares) = $630. Since
the stock price is expected to grow at a 9% rate, the conversion value should rise over
time. For example, in Year 5 it should be P5(CR) = $35(1.09)5(18) = $969. The ex-
pected conversion value is shown by the green line in Figure 19-1.
5. If the market price dropped below the straight-bond value, then those who wanted
bonds would recognize the bargain and buy the convertible as a bond. Similarly,

if the market price dropped below the conversion value, people would buy the
convertibles, exercise them to get stock, and then sell the stock at a profit. There-
fore, the higher of the bond value and conversion value curves in the graph repre-
sents a floor price for the bond. In Figure 19-1, the floor price is represented by the
red line.
6. The convertible bond’s market price will exceed the straight-bond value because
the option to convert is worth something—an 8% bond with conversion possi-
bilities is worth more than an 8% bond without this option. The convertible’s
price will also exceed its conversion value because holding the convertible is
equivalent to holding a call option and, prior to expiration, the option’s true value

is higher than its exercise (or conversion) value. Without using financial engi-
neering models, we cannot say exactly where the market value line will lie, but as
a rule it will be above the floor, as shown by the blue line in Figure 19-1.
7. If the stock price continues to increase, then it becomes more and more likely
that the bond will be converted. As this likelihood increases, the market value line
will begin to converge with the conversion value line.
After the bond becomes callable, its market value cannot exceed the higher of
the conversion value and the call price without exposing investors to the danger
of a call. For example, suppose that 10 years after issue (when the bonds become
callable) the market value of the bond is $1,600, the conversion value is $1,500,
and the call price is $1,050. If the company called the bonds the day after you
bought one for $1,600, you would choose to convert them to stock worth only
$1,500 (rather than let the company buy the bond from you at the $1,050 call
price), so you would suffer a loss of $100. Recognizing this danger, you and other
investors would refuse to pay a premium over the higher of the call price or the
conversion value after the bond becomes callable. Therefore, in Figure 19-1, we
assume that the market value line hits the conversion value line in Year 10, when
the bond becomes callable.
8. In our example, the call-protection period ends in 10 years. At this time, the expected
stock price is so high that the conversion value is almost certainly going to be greater
than the call price; hence we assume that the bond will be converted immediately prior
to the company calling the bond, which would happen in 10 years.
9. The expected market value at Year 10 is $35(1.09)10(18) = $1,491. An investor
can find the expected rate of return on the convertible bond, rc, by finding the
IRR of the following cash flow stream:
0
1
9
10
–1,000
80
80
80
1,491
With a financial calculator, we set N = 10, PV = −1000, PMT = 80, and FV = 1491;
we then solve for I/YR = rc = IRR = 10.94%.12
10. A convertible is riskier than straight debt but less risky than stock, so its cost of
capital should be somewhere between the cost of straight debt and the cost of
equity. This is true in our example: rd = 10%, rc = 10.94%, and rs = 13%.13
12As in the case with warrants, the expected conversion value is not precisely equal to the expected stock
price multiplied by the conversion ratio. Here is the reason. If after 10 years the stock price happens to be
low, so that the conversion value is less than the call price, then the bondholders would not choose to
convert—instead, they would surrender their bonds if the company called them. In this example, conver-
sion does not occur if the stock price is less than $1,050/18 = $58.33 after 10 years. Since the company
makes a call in order to force conversion, it won’t call the bonds if the stock price is less than $58.33. So
when the stock price is low, the bondholders will keep the bonds, whose value will depend primarily on
interest rates at that time. Finding the expected value in this situation is a difficult problem (and is beyond
the scope of this text)! However, if the expected stock price is much greater than the conversion price
when the bonds are called (in this case, 35[1.09]10 = $82.86 is much more than $58.33), then the differ-
ence between the true expected conversion value and the conversion value that we calculated using the
expected stock price will be very small. Therefore, we can approximate the component cost reasonably
accurately with the approach used in the example.
13To find the after-tax cost of the convertible, you can replace the pre-tax coupons with the after-tax
coupons paid by the company. If the corporate tax rate is 40%, then we have N = 10, PV = −1000,
PMT = 80(1 −0.40) = 48, and FV = 1491; we solve for I/YR = rc,AT = 8.16%. Notice that this after-tax
cost is not equal to rc(1 −T).

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

Use of Convertibles in Financing
Convertibles have two important advantages from the issuer’s standpoint: (1) Convertibles,
like bonds with warrants, offer a company the chance to sell debt with a low interest rate in
exchange for giving bondholders a chance to participate in the company’s success if it does
well. (2) In a sense, convertibles provide a way to sell common stock at prices higher than
those currently prevailing. Some companies actually want to sell common stock, not debt,
but feel that the price of their stock is temporarily depressed. Management may know, for
example, that earnings are depressed because of start-up costs associated with a new project,
but they expect earnings to rise sharply during the next year or so, pulling the price of the
stock up with them. Thus, if the company sold stock now, it would be giving up more
shares than necessary to raise a given amount of capital. However, if it set the conversion
price 20% to 30% above the present market price of the stock, then 20% to 30% fewer
shares would be given up when the bonds were converted than if stock were sold directly
at the current time. Note, however, that management is counting on the stock’s price to
rise above the conversion price, thus making the bonds attractive in conversion. If earnings
do not rise and pull the stock price up, so that conversion does not occur, then the company
will be saddled with debt in the face of low earnings, which could be disastrous.
How can the company be sure that conversion will occur if the price of the stock
rises above the conversion price? Typically, convertibles contain a call provision that
enables the issuing firm to force holders to convert. Suppose the conversion price is
$50, the conversion ratio is 20, the market price of the common stock has risen to
$60, and the call price on a convertible bond is $1,050. If the company calls the bond,
bondholders can either convert into common stock with a market value of 20($60) =
$1,200 or allow the company to redeem the bond for $1,050. Naturally, bondholders
prefer $1,200 to $1,050, so conversion would occur. The call provision thus gives the
company a way to force conversion, provided the market price of the stock is greater
than the conversion price. Note, however, that most convertibles have a fairly long
period of call protection—10 years is typical. Therefore, if the company wants to be
able to force conversion fairly early, it will have to set a short call-protection period.
This will, in turn, require that it set a higher coupon rate or a lower conversion price.
From the standpoint of the issuer, convertibles have three important disadvan-
tages: (1) Even though the use of a convertible bond may give the company the
opportunity to sell stock at a price higher than the price at which it could be sold
currently, if the stock greatly increases in price then the firm would be better off if
it had used straight debt (in spite of its higher cost) and then later sold common stock
and refunded the debt. (2) Convertibles typically have a low coupon interest rate, and
the advantage of this low-cost debt will be lost when conversion occurs. (3) If the
company truly wants to raise equity capital and if the price of the stock does not
rise sufficiently after the bond is issued, then the company will be stuck with debt.
Convertibles and Agency Costs
A potential agency conflict between bondholders and stockholders is asset substitution, also
known as “bait and switch.” Suppose a company has been investing in low-risk projects,
and because risk is low, bondholders charge a low interest rate. What happens if the
company is considering a very risky but highly profitable venture that potential lenders
don’t know about? The company might decide to raise low–interest-rate debt without re-
vealing that the funds will be invested in a risky project. After the funds have been raised
and the investment is made, the value of the debt should fall because its interest rate will be
too low to compensate debtholders for the high risk they bear. This is a “heads I win, tails
you lose” situation, and it results in a wealth transfer from bondholders to stockholders.
Chapter 19: Hybrid Financing: Preferred Stock, Warrants, and Convertibles
775

Let’s use some numbers to illustrate this scenario. The value of a company, based on
the present value of its future free cash flows, is $800 million. It has $300 million of debt,
based on market values. Therefore, its equity is worth $800 −$300 = $500 million. The
company now undertakes some projects with high but risky expected returns, and its ex-
pected NPV remains unchanged. In other words, the actual NPV will probably end up
much higher or much lower than under the old situation, but the firm still has the same
expected value. Even though its total value is still $800 million, the value of the debt falls
because its risk has increased. Note that the debtholders don’t benefit if the venture’s
value is higher than expected, because the most they can receive is the contracted coupon
and the principal repayment. However, they will suffer if the value of the projects turns
out to be lower than expected, since they might not receive the full value of their con-
tracted payments. In other words, risk doesn’t give them any upside potential but does
expose them to downside losses, so the bondholders’ expected value must decline.
With a constant total firm value, if the value of the debt falls from $300 to $200
million, then the value of equity must increase from $500 to $800 −$200 = $600
million. Thus, the bait-and-switch tactic causes a wealth transfer of $100 million
from debtholders to stockholders.
If debtholders think a company might employ the bait-and-switch tactic, they will
charge a higher interest rate, and this higher interest rate is an agency cost. Debt-
holders will charge this higher rate even if the company has no intention of engaging
in bait-and-switch behavior, since they can’t know the company’s true intentions.
Therefore, they assume the worst and charge a higher interest rate.
Convertible securities are one way to mitigate this type of agency cost. Suppose
the debt is convertible and the company does take on the high-risk project. If the
value of the company turns out to be higher than expected, then bondholders can
convert their debt to equity and benefit from the successful investment. Therefore,
bondholders are willing to charge a lower interest rate on convertibles, and this
serves to minimize the agency costs.
Note that if a company does not engage in bait-and-switch behavior by swapping
low-risk projects for high-risk projects, then the chance of “hitting a home run” is
reduced. Because there is less chance of a home run, the convertible bond is less
likely to be converted. In this situation, the convertible bonds are actually similar to
nonconvertible debt, except that they carry a lower interest rate.
Now consider a different agency cost, one due to asymmetric information between the
managers and potential new stockholders. Suppose a firm’s managers know that its future
prospects are not as good as the market believes, which means the current stock price is
too high. Acting in the interests of existing stockholders, managers can issue stock at the
current high price. When the poor future prospects are eventually revealed, the stock price
will fall, causing a transfer of wealth from the new shareholders to old shareholders.
To illustrate this, suppose the market estimates an $800 million present value of fu-
ture free cash flows. For simplicity, assume the firm has no nonoperating assets and no
debt, so the total value of both the firm and the equity is $800 million. However, its
managers know the market has overestimated the future free cash flows and that the
true value is only $700 million. When investors eventually discover this, the value of
the company will drop to $700 million. But before this happens, suppose the company
raises $200 million of new equity. The company uses this new cash to invest in projects
with a present value of $200 million, which shouldn’t be too hard, since these are pro-
jects with a zero NPV. Right after the new stock is sold, the company will have a mar-
ket value of $800 + $200 = $1,000 million, based on the market’s overly optimistic
estimate of the company’s future prospects. Observe that the new shareholders own
20% of the company ($200/$1,000 = 0.20) and the original shareholders own 80%.
776
Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

As time passes, the market will realize that the previously estimated value of $800
million for the company’s original set of projects was too high and that these projects
are worth only $700 million. The new projects are still worth $200 million, so the
total value of the company will fall to $700 + $200 = $900 million. The original
shareholders’ value is now 80% of $900 million, which is $720 million. Note that
this is $20 million more than it would have been if the company had issued no new
stock. The new shareholders’ value is now 0.20($900) = $180 million, which is $20
million less than their original investment. The net effect is a $20 million wealth
transfer from the new shareholders to the original shareholders.
Because potential shareholders know this might occur, they interpret an issue of
new stock as a signal of poor future prospects, which causes the stock price to fall.
Note also that this will occur even for companies whose future prospects are actually
quite good, because the market has no way of distinguishing between companies with
good versus poor prospects.
A company with good future prospects might want to issue equity, but it knows
the market will interpret this as a negative signal. One way to obtain equity and yet
avoid this signaling effect is to issue convertible bonds. Because the company knows
its true future prospects are better than the market anticipates, it knows the bonds
will likely end up being converted to equity. Thus, a company in this situation is
issuing equity “through the back door” when it issues convertible debt.
In summary, convertibles are logical securities to use in at least two situations.
First, if a company would like to finance with straight debt but lenders are afraid
the funds will be invested in a manner that increases the firm’s risk profile, then con-
vertibles are a good choice. Second, if a company wants to issue stock but thinks such
a move would cause investors to interpret a stock offering as a signal of tough times
ahead, then again convertibles would be a good choice.14

Convertible debt can be thought of as straight debt with nondetachable warrants.

are more or less interchangeable. However, a closer look reveals one major and
several minor differences between these two securities.15 First, as we discussed previ-
ously, the exercise of warrants brings in new equity capital, whereas the conversion of
convertibles results only in an accounting transfer.
A second difference involves flexibility. Most convertibles contain a call provision that
allows the issuer either to refund the debt or to force conversion, depending on the rela-
tionship between the conversion value and call price. However, most warrants are not
callable, so firms must wait until maturity for the warrants to generate new equity capital.
Generally, maturities also differ between warrants and convertibles. Warrants typically
have much shorter maturities than convertibles, and warrants typically expire before their
accompanying debt matures. Warrants also provide for fewer future common shares than
do convertibles, because with convertibles all of the debt is converted to stock, whereas
debt remains outstanding when warrants are exercised. Together, these facts suggest that
debt-plus-warrant issuers are actually more interested in selling debt than in selling equity.
In general, firms that issue debt with warrants are smaller and riskier than those
that issue convertibles. One possible rationale for the use of option securities, espe-
cially the use of debt with warrants by small firms, is the difficulty investors have in
assessing the risk of small companies. If a start-up with a new, untested product seeks
debt financing, then it’s difficult for potential lenders to judge the riskiness of the
venture and so it’s difficult to set a fair interest rate. Under these circumstances,
many potential investors will be reluctant to invest, making it necessary to set a very
high interest rate to attract debt capital. By issuing debt with warrants, investors
obtain a package that offers upside potential to offset the risks of loss.
Finally, there is a significant difference in issuance costs between debt with
warrants and convertible debt. Bonds with warrants typically require issuance costs
that are about 1.2 percentage points more than the flotation costs for convertibles.
In general, bond-with-warrant financings have underwriting fees that approximate
the weighted average of the fees associated with debt and equity issues, whereas
underwriting costs for convertibles are more like those associated with straight debt.

19.5 REPORTING EARNINGS WHEN WARRANTS
OR CONVERTIBLES ARE OUTSTANDING
If warrants or convertibles are outstanding, the Financial Accounting Standard Board
requires that a firm report basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share.16
15For a more detailed comparison of warrants and convertibles, see Michael S. Long and Stephen F. Sef-
cik, “Participation Financing: A Comparison of the Characteristics of Convertible Debt and Straight
Bonds Issued in Conjunction with Warrants,” Financial Management, Autumn 1990, pp. 23–34.
16FAS 128 was issued in February of 1997. It simplified the calculations required by firms, made U.S.
standards more consistent with international standards, and required the presentation of both basic EPS
and diluted EPS for those firms with significant amounts of convertible securities. In addition, it replaced
a measure called primary EPS with basic EPS. In general, the calculation of primary EPS required the
company to estimate whether or not a security was “likely to be converted in the near future” and to
base the calculation of EPS on the assumption that those securities would in fact have been converted. In
June 2008 the FASB issued FSP APB 14-1, which (although not changing how EPS is reported under
FAS 128) requires that convertibles be split into their implied equity and debt components for accounting
purposes, in much the same way as we analyze them in this chapter.

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

1. Basic EPS is calculated as earnings available to common stockholders divided by
the average number of shares actually outstanding during the period.
2. Diluted EPS is calculated as the earnings that would have been available to common
shareholders divided by the average number of shares that would have been out-
standing if “dilutive” securities had been converted. The rules governing the calcu-
lation of diluted EPS are quite complex; here we present a simple illustration using
convertible bonds. If the bonds had been converted at the beginning of the ac-
counting period, then the firm’s interest payments would have been lower because it
would not have had to pay interest on the bonds, and this would have caused earn-
ings to be higher. But the number of outstanding shares of stock also would have
increased because of the conversion. If the higher earnings and higher number of
shares caused EPS to fall, then the convertible bonds would be defined as dilutive
securities because their conversion would decrease (or dilute) EPS. All convertible
securities with a net dilutive effect are included when calculating diluted EPS.
Therefore, this definition means that diluted EPS always will be lower than basic
EPS. In essence, the diluted EPS measure is an attempt to show how the presence
of convertible securities reduces common shareholders’ claims on the firm.
Under SEC rules, firms are required to report both basic and diluted EPS. For
firms with large amounts of option securities outstanding, there can be a substantial
difference between the basic and diluted EPS figures. This makes it easier for inves-
tors to compare the performance of U.S. firms with their foreign counterparts, which
tend to use basic EPS.

Summary
Although common stock and long-term debt provide most of the capital used by cor-
porations, companies also use several forms of “hybrid securities.” The hybrids include
preferred stock, convertibles, and warrants, and they generally have some characteris-
tics of debt and some of equity. The key concepts covered are listed below.
•
Preferred stock is a hybrid—it is similar to bonds in some respects and to com-
mon stock in other ways.
•
Adjustable rate preferred stocks (ARPs) pay dividends tied to the rate on
Treasury securities. Market auction (money market) preferred stocks are
low-risk, largely tax-exempt securities of 7-week maturity that can be sold
between auction dates at close to par.
•
A warrant is a long-term call option issued along with a bond. Warrants are
generally detachable from the bond, and they trade separately in the market.
When warrants are exercised, the firm receives additional equity capital, and
the original bonds remain outstanding.
•
A convertible security is a bond or preferred stock that can be exchanged for
common stock at the option of the holder. When a security is converted, debt
or preferred stock is replaced with common stock, and no money changes hands.
•
Warrant and convertible issues generally are structured so that the strike price
(also called the exercise price) or conversion price is 20% to 30% above the
stock’s price at time of issue.
Chapter 19: Hybrid Financing: Preferred Stock, Warrants, and Convertibles
779

•
Although both warrants and convertibles are option securities, there are several
differences between the two, including separability, impact when exercised,
callability, maturity, and flotation costs.
•
Warrants and convertibles are sweeteners used to make the underlying debt or pre-
ferred stock issue more attractive to investors. Although the coupon rate or dividend
yield is lower when options are part of the issue, the overall cost of the issue is higher
than the cost of straight debt or preferred, because option-related securities are riskier.

textbook’s Web site.

Warrants
Maese Industries Inc. has warrants outstanding that permit the holders to purchase 1
share of stock per warrant at a price of $25.
a. Calculate the exercise value of the firm’s warrants if the common sells at each of
the following prices: (1) $20, (2) $25, (3) $30, (4) $100. (Hint: A warrant’s exercise
value is the difference between the stock price and the purchase price specified by
the warrant if the warrant were to be exercised.)

some 20-year, $1,000 par value bonds with interest paid annually. Each bond will
have attached 50 warrants, each exercisable into 1 share of stock at an exercise price
of $25. The firm’s straight bonds yield 12%. Assume that each warrant will have a
market value of $3 when the stock sells at $20. What coupon interest rate, and
dollar coupon, must the company set on the bonds with warrants if they are to clear
the market? (Hint: The convertible bond should have an initial price of $1,000.)

Convertible Premiums
The Tsetsekos Company was planning to finance an expansion. The principal execu-
tives of the company all agreed that an industrial company such as theirs should finance
growth by means of common stock rather than by debt. However, they felt that the
current $42 per share price of the company’s common stock did not reflect its true
worth, so they decided to sell a convertible security. They considered a convertible
debenture but feared the burden of fixed interest charges if the common stock did
not rise enough in price to make conversion attractive. They decided on an issue of
convertible preferred stock, which would pay a dividend of $2.10 per share.
a. The conversion ratio will be 1.0; that is, each share of convertible preferred can
be converted into a single share of common. Therefore, the convertible’s par
value (and also the issue price) will be equal to the conversion price, which in
turn will be determined as a premium (i.e., the percentage by which the
conversion price exceeds the stock price) over the current market price of the
common stock. What will the conversion price be if it is set at a 10% pre-
mium? At a 30% premium?
b. Should the preferred stock include a call provision? Why?

Fifteen years ago, Roop Industries sold $400 million of convertible bonds. The bonds
had a 40-year maturity, a 5.75% coupon rate, and paid interest annually. They were
sold at their $1,000 par value. The conversion price was set at $62.75, and the

common stock price was $55 per share. The bonds were subordinated debentures
and were given an A rating; straight nonconvertible debentures of the same quality
yielded about 8.75% at the time Roop’s bonds were issued.
a. Calculate the premium on the bonds—that is, the percentage excess of the
conversion price over the stock price at the time of issue.
b. What is Roop’s annual before-tax interest savings on the convertible issue
versus a straight-debt issue?
c. At the time the bonds were issued, what was the value per bond of the conver-
sion feature?
d. Suppose the price of Roop’s common stock fell from $55 on the day the bonds
were issued to $32.75 now, 15 years after the issue date (also assume the stock
price never exceeded $62.75). Assume interest rates remained constant. What is
the current price of the straight-bond portion of the convertible bond? What is
the current value if a bondholder converts a bond? Do you think it is likely that
the bonds will be converted?
e. The bonds originally sold for $1,000. If interest rates on A-rated bonds
had remained constant at 8.75% and if the stock price had fallen to $32.75,
then what do you think would have happened to the price of the convertible
bonds? (Assume no change in the standard deviation of stock returns.)

Warrant/Convertible
Decisions
The Howland Carpet Company has grown rapidly during the past 5 years. Recently,
its commercial bank urged the company to consider increasing its permanent financing.
Its bank loan under a line of credit has risen to $250,000, carrying an 8% interest rate.
Howland has been 30 to 60 days late in paying trade creditors.
Discussions with an investment banker have resulted in the decision to raise
$500,000 at this time. Investment bankers have assured the firm that the following
alternatives are feasible (flotation costs will be ignored).
•
Alternative 1: Sell common stock at $8.
•
Alternative 2: Sell convertible bonds at an 8% coupon, convertible into 100 shares
of common stock for each $1,000 bond (i.e., the conversion price is $10 per share).
• Alternative 3: Sell debentures at an 8% coupon, each $1,000 bond carrying 100
warrants to buy common stock at $10.
John L. Howland, the president, owns 80% of the common stock and wishes to
maintain control of the company. There are 100,000 shares outstanding. The follow-

Convertible Bond
Analysis
Niendorf Incorporated needs to raise $25 million to construct production facili-
ties for a new type of USB memory device. The firm’s straight nonconvertible
debentures currently yield 9%. Its stock sells for $23 per share, has an expected
constant growth rate of 6%, and has an expected dividend yield of 7%, for a total
expected return on equity of 13%. Investment bankers have tentatively proposed
that the firm raise the $25 million by issuing convertible debentures. These
convertibles would have a $1,000 par value, carry a coupon rate of 8%, have a
20-year maturity, and be convertible into 35 shares of stock. Coupon payments
would be made annually. The bonds would be noncallable for 5 years, after which
they would be callable at a price of $1,075; this call price would decline by $5 per
year in Year 6 and each year thereafter. For simplicity, assume that the bonds
may be called or converted only at the end of a year, immediately after the
coupon
and
dividend
payments.
Also
assume
that
management
would
call
eligible bonds if the conversion value exceeded 20% of par value (not 20% of
call price).
a. At what year do you expect the bonds will be forced into conversion with a
call? What is the bond’s value in conversion when it is converted at this
time? What is the cash flow to the bondholder when it is converted at this
time? (Hint: The cash flow includes the conversion value and the coupon
payment, because the conversion occurs immediately after the coupon
is paid.)
b. What is the expected rate of return (i.e., the before-tax component cost) on the
proposed convertible issue?

Mini Case
Paul Duncan, financial manager of EduSoft Inc., is facing a dilemma. The firm was founded 5
years ago to provide educational software for the rapidly expanding primary and secondary
school markets. Although EduSoft has done well, the firm’s founder believes an industry
shakeout is imminent. To survive, EduSoft must grab market share now, and this will require
a large infusion of new capital.
Because he expects earnings to continue rising sharply and looks for the stock price to fol-
low suit, Mr. Duncan does not think it would be wise to issue new common stock at this time.
On the other hand, interest rates are currently high by historical standards, and the firm’s B
rating means that interest payments on a new debt issue would be prohibitive. Thus, he has
narrowed his choice of financing alternatives to (1) preferred stock, (2) bonds with warrants,
or (3) convertible bonds.
As Duncan’s assistant, you have been asked to help in the decision process by answering
the following questions.
a. How does preferred stock differ from both common equity and debt? Is preferred stock
more risky than common stock? What is floating rate preferred stock?
b. How can a knowledge of call options help a financial manager to better understand war-
rants and convertibles?
c. Mr. Duncan has decided to eliminate preferred stock as one of the alternatives and focus
on the others. EduSoft’s investment banker estimates that EduSoft could issue a bond-
with-warrants package consisting of a 20-year bond and 27 warrants. Each warrant would
have a strike price of $25 and 10 years until expiration. It is estimated that each warrant,
when detached and traded separately, would have a value of $5. The coupon on a similar
bond but without warrants would be 10%.

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

(1) What coupon rate should be set on the bond with warrants if the total pack-
age is to sell at par ($1,000)?
(2) When would you expect the warrants to be exercised? What is a stepped-up
exercise price?
(3) Will the warrants bring in additional capital when exercised? If EduSoft issues
100,000 bond-with-warrant packages, how much cash will EduSoft receive
when the warrants are exercised? How many shares of stock will be outstand-
ing after the warrants are exercised? (EduSoft currently has 20 million shares
outstanding.)
(4) Because the presence of warrants results in a lower coupon rate on the ac-
companying debt issue, shouldn’t all debt be issued with warrants? To answer
this, estimate the anticipated stock price in 10 years when the warrants are ex-
pected to be exercised, then estimate the return to the holders of the bond-
with-warrants packages. Use the corporate valuation model to estimate the
expected stock price in 10 years. Assume that EduSoft’s current value of op-
erations is $500 million and it is expected to grow at 8% per year.
(5) How would you expect the cost of the bond with warrants to compare with
the cost of straight debt? With the cost of common stock (which is 13.4%)?
(6) If the corporate tax rate is 40%, what is the after-tax cost of the bond with
warrants?
d. As an alternative to the bond with warrants, Mr. Duncan is considering convert-
ible bonds. The firm’s investment bankers estimate that EduSoft could sell a
20-year, 8.5% coupon (paid annually), callable convertible bond for its $1,000
par value, whereas a straight-debt issue would require a 10% coupon (paid annu-
ally). The convertibles would be call protected for 5 years, the call price would
be $1,100, and the company would probably call the bonds as soon as possible
after their conversion value exceeds $1,200. Note, though, that the call must
occur on an issue-date anniversary. EduSoft’s current stock price is $20, its last
dividend was $1, and the dividend is expected to grow at a constant 8% rate.
The convertible could be converted into 40 shares of EduSoft stock at the own-
er’s option.
(1) What conversion price is built into the bond?
(2) What is the convertible’s straight-debt value? What is the implied value of
the convertibility feature?
(3) What is the formula for the bond’s expected conversion value in any year?
What is its conversion value at Year 0? At Year 10?
(4) What is meant by the “floor value” of a convertible? What is the convertible’s
expected floor value at Year 0? At Year 10?
(5) Assume that EduSoft intends to force conversion by calling the bond as soon
as possible after its conversion value exceeds 20% above its par value, or
1.2($1,000) = $1,200. When is the issue expected to be called? (Hint: Recall
that the call must be made on an anniversary date of the issue.)
(6) What is the expected cost of capital for the convertible to EduSoft? Does this
cost appear to be consistent with the riskiness of the issue?
(7) What is the after-tax cost of the convertible bond?
e. Mr. Duncan believes that the costs of both the bond with warrants and the con-
vertible bond are close enough to call them even and also are consistent with the
risks involved. Thus, he will make his decision based on other factors. What are
some of the factors that he should consider?
f. How do convertible bonds help reduce agency costs?

Initial Public Offerings,
Investment Banking, and
Financial Restructuring
O
n any given day, thousands of businesses go to the market to
raise capital. Here are some examples of securities sold during
2009.
1. SolarWinds, a network software developer, raised $151.5 million in an
initial public offering. The underwriters were led by JP Morgan, Gold-
man Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. Of the 12.1 million shares sold to
the public, about three-fourths were new shares whose sale gener-
ated cash for SolarWinds; the balance came from founders and
previous venture capital investors who were cashing in on their
previous investments in SolarWinds.
2. Vertex Pharmaceuticals, already a publicly traded company, sold an
additional 10 million shares at $32 per share. After underwriting fees
and other expenses, Vertex netted about $313 million. Vertex plans to
use the proceeds for continuing development of drugs already in its
pipeline.
3. Oracle raised a total of $4.5 billion by selling a combination of (1) 3.75%
coupon 5-year bonds; (2) 5.0% coupon 10-year bonds; and (3) 6.25%
coupon 30-year bonds. Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and Wachovia
were joint lead managers in the offering. Oracle stated that one use of the
funds would be to help finance its proposed acquisition of Sun
Microsystems.
These three issues exemplify an initial public offering, an additional
stock offering by an already-public company, and a debt offering. In each
case, the underwriting investment bankers made substantial profits. After
reading this chapter, you should have a better understanding of the
procedures that these and other firms use to issue securities.
787

Previous chapters described how a company makes capital structure and dividend pol-
icy decisions. Those decisions affect a firm’s need for new capital and the form or
forms in which this capital is raised. We now discuss the actual process of raising capi-
tal, including the roles played by investment banks and regulatory agencies.
20.1 THE FINANCIAL LIFE CYCLE
OF A START-UP COMPANY
Most businesses begin life as proprietorships or partnerships, and if they become successful
and grow, at some point they find it desirable to become corporations. Initially, most cor-
porate stock is owned by the firms’ founding managers and key employees. Even start-up
firms that are ultimately successful usually begin with negative free cash flows because of
their high growth rates and product development costs; hence, they must raise capital dur-
ing these high-growth years. If the founding owner-managers have invested all of their own
financial resources in the company, then they must turn to outside sources of capital. Start-
up firms generally have high growth opportunities relative to assets-in-place, and they
suffer from especially large problems with asymmetric information. Therefore, as we dis-
cussed in Chapter 15, they must raise external capital primarily as equity rather than debt.
To protect investors from fraudulent stock issues, in 1933 Congress enacted the Securi-
ties Act, which created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate the
financial markets.1 The Securities Act regulates interstate public offerings, which we explain
later in this section, but it also provides several exemptions that allow companies to issue
securities through private placements that are not registered with the SEC. The rules
governing these exemptions are quite complex, but in general they restrict the number
and type of investors who may participate in an issue. Accredited investors include the
officers and directors of the company, high-wealth individuals, and institutional investors.
In a nonregistered private placement, the company may issue securities to an unlimited
number of accredited investors but to only 35 nonaccredited investors. In addition, none
of the investors can sell their securities in the secondary market to the general public.
For most start-ups, the first round of external financing comes through a private
placement of equity to one or two individual investors, called angels. In return for a
typical investment in the range of $50,000 to $400,000, the angels receive stock and
perhaps also a seat on the board of directors. Because angels can influence the strate-
gic direction of the company, it is best when they bring experience and industry con-
tacts to the table, not just cash.
As the company grows, its financing requirements may exceed the resources of
individual investors, in which case it is likely to turn to a venture capital fund.
A venture capital fund is a private limited partnership, which typically raises $30 mil-
lion to $80 million from a relatively small group of primarily institutional investors,
including pension funds, college endowments, and corporations.2 The managers of a

1In addition to federal statutes, which affect transactions that cross state borders, states have “Blue Sky”
laws that regulate securities sold just within the state. These laws were designed to prevent unscrupulous
dealers from selling something of little worth, such as blue sky, to naïve investors.
2The typical venture capital fund is a private limited partnership, with limited partners and a general
partner. The limited partners contribute cash but are prohibited from being involved in the partnership’s
decision making. Because of their limited participation, they are not held liable for any of the partner-
ship’s liabilities, except to the extent of their original investment. The general partner usually contributes
a relatively modest amount of cash but acts as the partnership’s manager. In return, the general partner
normally receives annual compensation equal to 1% to 2% of the fund’s assets plus a 20% share of the
fund’s eventual profits.

They screen hundreds of companies and ultimately fund around a dozen, called
portfolio companies. The venture fund buys shares of the portfolio companies,
and the VCs sit on the companies’ boards of directors. The venture capital fund usu-
ally has a prespecified life of 7 to 10 years, after which it is dissolved, either by selling
the portfolio companies’ stock and distributing the proceeds to the funds’ investors or
by directly distributing the stock to the investors.

20.2 THE DECISION TO GO PUBLIC
Going public means selling some of a company’s stock to outside investors in an
initial public offering (IPO) and then letting the stock trade in public markets. For
example, Visa, RiskMetrics Group, GT Solar International, and many other compa-
nies took this step in 2009. The advantages and disadvantages of public stock owner-
ship are discussed next.
Advantages of Going Public
There are many advantages to going public, as we detail in the following list.
1. Increases liquidity and allows founders to harvest their wealth. The stock of a private,
or closely held, corporation is illiquid. It may be hard for one of the owners who
wants to sell some shares to find a ready buyer, and even if a buyer is located,
there is no established price on which to base the transaction. This is one of the
reasons that SolarWinds, a company whose IPO we mentioned in the opening
vignette, went public in 2009.
2. Permits founders to diversify. As a company grows and becomes more valuable, its
founders often have most of their wealth tied up in the company. By selling some
of their stock in a public offering, they can diversify their holdings, thereby
reducing the riskiness of their personal portfolios.
3. Facilitates raising new corporate cash. If a privately held company wants to raise cash
by selling new stock, it must either go to its existing owners, who may not have
any money or may not want to put more eggs in this particular basket, or else
shop around for wealthy investors. However, it is usually quite difficult to get
outsiders to put money into a closely held company, because if the outsiders do
not have voting control (more than 50% of the stock) then the inside stock-
holders/managers can take advantage of them. Going public, which brings with it
both public disclosure of information and regulation by the SEC, greatly reduces
this problem and thus makes people more willing to invest in the company,
which makes it easier for the firm to raise capital.
4. Establishes a value for the firm. If a company wants to give incentive stock options
to key employees, it is useful to know the exact value of those options. Employees
much prefer to own stock, or options on stock, that is publicly traded and there-
fore liquid. Also, when the owner of a privately owned business dies, state and
federal tax appraisers must set a value on the company for estate tax purposes.
Often these appraisers set a higher value than that of a similar publicly traded
company.

5. Facilitates merger negotiations. Having an established market price helps when a
company either is being acquired or is seeking to acquire another company in
which the payment will be with stock.
6. Increases potential markets. Many companies report that it is easier to sell their
products and services to potential customers after they become publicly traded.
Disadvantages of Going Public
There are also a number of disadvantages associated with going public, as follows.
1. Cost of reporting. A publicly owned company must file quarterly and annual
reports with the SEC and/or various state agencies. These reports can be a costly
burden, especially for small firms. In addition, compliance with the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act often requires considerable expense and manpower.
2. Disclosure. Management may not like the idea of reporting operating data, because
these data will then be available to competitors. Similarly, the owners of the
company may not want people to know their net worth. But since a publicly
owned company must disclose the number of shares owned by its officers, direc-
tors, and major stockholders, it is easy enough for anyone to multiply shares held
by price per share to estimate the net worth of the insiders.
3. Self-dealings and consumption of perks. Consider a privately held company whose
CEO owns less than 100% of the company. If the other owners are not involved in
the day-to-day operations of the company, then the owner-manager has many
opportunities for various types of legal but unethical self-dealings, including the
payment of high salaries, nepotism, personal transactions with the business (such as a
leasing arrangement), and not-truly-necessary fringe benefits. Observe that the
owner-manager receives the full benefit of these perks but that the costs are partially
born by the other owners. (Of course, if a company is wholly owned, then there is no
ethical violation because the owner is also bearing the full cost of the perks.) Such
self-dealings are much harder to arrange if a company is publicly owned.
4. Inactive market and/or low price. If the firm is very small and if its shares are not
traded frequently, then its stock will not really be liquid and so the market price
may not represent the stock’s true value. Security analysts and stockbrokers sim-
ply will not follow the stock, because there will not be sufficient trading activity
to generate enough brokerage commissions to cover the costs of following it.
5. Control. Because of possible tender offers and proxy fights, the managers of publicly
owned firms who do not have voting control must be concerned about maintaining
control. Further, there is pressure on such managers to produce annual earnings
gains, even when it might be in the shareholders’ best long-term interests to adopt a
strategy that reduces short-term earnings but raises them in future years. These fac-
tors have led a number of public companies to “go private” in leveraged buyout
deals, where the managers borrow the money to buy out the nonmanagement
stockholders. We discuss the decision to go private in a later section.
6. Investor relations. Public companies must keep investors abreast of current devel-
opments. Many CFOs of newly public firms report that they spend two full days
a week talking with investors and analysts.
Conclusions on Going Public
There are no hard-and-fast rules regarding if or when a company should go public.
This is an individual decision that should be made on the basis of the company’s and
stockholders’ own unique circumstances. If a company does decide to go public,
790
Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

either by selling newly issued stock to raise new capital or by selling stock of the cur-
rent owners, the key issue is setting the price at which shares will be offered to the
public. The company and its current owners should want to set the price as high as
possible: the higher the offering price, the smaller the fraction of the company the
current owners will have to give up to obtain any specified amount of money. On
the other hand, potential buyers want the price set as low as possible. We return to
the establishment of the offering price later in the chapter, after we describe some
other aspects of common stock financing.

20.3 THE PROCESS OF GOING PUBLIC: AN
INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
As the following sections show, an initial public offering is a lot more complicated,
expensive, and time-consuming than simply making the decision to go public.
Selecting an Investment Bank
After a company decides to go public, it faces the problem of how to sell its stock to a
large number of investors. Although most companies know how to sell their pro-
ducts, few have experience in selling securities. To help in this process, the company
will interview a number of different investment banks, also called underwriters,
and then select one to be the lead underwriter. To understand the factors that affect
this choice, it helps to understand exactly what investment banks do.
First, the investment bank helps the firm determine the preliminary offering price,
or price range, for the stock and the number of shares to be sold. The investment
bank’s reputation and experience in the company’s industry are critical in convincing
potential investors to purchase the stock at the offering price. In effect, the investment
bank implicitly certifies that the stock is not overpriced, which obviously comforts
investors. Second, the investment bank actually sells the shares to its existing clients,
which include a mix of institutional investors and retail (that is, individual) customers.
Third, the investment bank, through its associated brokerage house, will have an
analyst “cover” the stock after it is issued. This analyst will regularly distribute reports
to investors describing the stock’s prospects, which will help to maintain an interest in
the stock. Well-respected analysts increase the likelihood that there will be a liquid
secondary market for the stock and that its price will reflect the company’s true value.
The Underwriting Syndicate
The firm and its investment bank must next decide whether the bank will work on a
best efforts basis or will underwrite the issue. In a best efforts sale, the bank does
not guarantee that the securities will be sold or that the company will get the cash it
needs, only that it will put forth its “best efforts” to sell the issue. On an underwrit-
ten issue, in contrast, the company does get a guarantee: the bank agrees to buy the
entire issue and then resell the stock to its customers. Therefore, the bank bears sig-
nificant risks in underwritten offerings. For example, on one IBM bond issue interest
rates rose sharply and bond prices fell after the deal had been set but before the
investment banks could sell the bonds to the ultimate purchasers. The banks lost
somewhere between $10 million and $20 million. Had the offering been on a best
efforts basis, IBM would have been the loser.
Chapter 20: Initial Public Offerings, Investment Banking, and Financial Restructuring
791

Except for extremely small issues, virtually all IPOs are underwritten. Investors are
required to pay for securities within ten days, and the investment bank must pay the
issuing firm within four days of the official commencement of the offering. Typically,
the bank sells the stock within a day or two after the offering begins, but on occasion
the bank miscalculates, sets the offering price too high, and thus is unable to move
the issue. At other times, the market declines during the offering period, forcing the
bank to reduce the price of the stock or bonds. In either instance, on an underwritten
offering the firm receives the price that was agreed upon, so the bank must absorb
any losses that are incurred.
Because they are exposed to large potential losses, investment banks typically do
not handle the purchase and distribution of issues single-handedly unless the issue is
a very small one. If the sum of money involved is large, then investment banks form
underwriting syndicates in an effort to minimize the risk each individual bank faces.
The banking house that sets up the deal is called the lead, or managing, under-
writer. Syndicated offerings are usually covered by more analysts, which contributes
to greater liquidity in the post-IPO secondary market. Thus, syndication provides
benefits to both underwriters and issuers.
In addition to the underwriting syndicate, on larger offerings still more investment
banks are included in a selling group, which handles the distribution of securities to
individual investors. The selling group includes all members of the underwriting syn-
dicate plus additional dealers who take relatively small percentages of the total issue
from the members of the underwriting syndicate. Thus, the underwriters act as
wholesalers while members of the selling group act as retailers. The number of bro-
kerage houses in a selling group depends partly on the size of the issue, but it is nor-
mally in the range of 10 to 15.
A new selling procedure has recently emerged that takes advantage of the
trend toward institutional ownership of stock. In this type of sale, called an un-
syndicated stock offering, the managing underwriter—acting alone—sells the
issue entirely to a group of institutional investors, thus bypassing both retail
stockbrokers and individual investors. In recent years, about 50% of all stock
sold has been by unsyndicated offerings. Behind this phenomenon is a simple mo-
tivating force: money. The fees that issuers pay on a syndicated offering, which
include commissions paid to retail brokers, can run a full percentage point higher
than those on unsyndicated offerings. Moreover, although total fees are lower in
unsyndicated offerings, managing underwriters usually come out ahead because
they do not have to share the fees with an underwriting syndicate. However,
some types of stock do not appeal to institutional investors, so not all firms can
use unsyndicated offers.
Regulation of Securities Sales
Sales of new securities, and also sales in the secondary markets, are regulated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and, to a lesser extent, by each of the 50 states.
There are four primary elements of SEC regulation.
1. Jurisdiction. The SEC has jurisdiction over all interstate public offerings in
amounts of $1.5 million or more.
2. Registration. Newly issued securities (stocks and bonds) must be registered with
the SEC at least 20 days before they are publicly offered. The registration
statement, called Form S-1, provides financial, legal, and technical information
about the company to the SEC. A prospectus, which is embedded in the S-1,
summarizes this information for investors. The SEC’s lawyers and accountants
WWW
The SEC Web site allows
users to search for any
filings by a company,
including Form S-1. See
http://www.sec.gov/
edgar.shtml.
792
Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

analyze both the registration statement and the prospectus; if the information is
inadequate or misleading, the SEC will delay or stop the public offering.3
3. Prospectus. After the SEC declares the registration to be effective, new securities
may be advertised, but all sales solicitations must be accompanied by the pro-
spectus. Preliminary, or “red herring,” prospectuses may be distributed to
potential buyers during the 20-day waiting period after the registration is effec-
tive, but no sales may be finalized during this time. The “red herring” prospectus
(so called because it has a standard legal disclaimer printed in red across its cover)
contains all the key information that will appear in the final prospectus except the
final price, which is generally set after the market closes the day before the new
securities are actually offered to the public.
4. Truth in reporting. If the registration statement or prospectus contains misrepre-
sentations or omissions of material facts, then any purchaser who suffers a loss
may sue for damages. Severe penalties may be imposed on the issuer or its
officers, directors, accountants, engineers, appraisers, underwriters, and all others
who participated in the preparation of the registration statement or prospectus.
The Roadshow and Book-Building
After the registration statement has been filed, the senior management team, the
investment banker, and the company’s lawyers go on a roadshow. The management
team will make three to seven presentations each day to potential institutional investors,
who typically are existing clients of the underwriters. The institutional investors ask
questions during the presentation, but the management team may not give any informa-
tion that is not in the registration statement. Nor may the management team make any
forecasts or express any opinions about the value of their company. These provisions are
due to the SEC-mandated quiet period. This quiet period begins when the registration
statement is made effective and lasts for 40 days after the stock begins trading. Its pur-
pose is to create a level playing field for all investors by ensuring that they all have access
to the same information. It is not uncommon for the SEC to delay an IPO if managers
violate the quiet period rules. The typical roadshow may last 10 to 14 days, with stops in
10 to 20 different cities. In many ways the process resembles a coming-out party for the
company, but it is much more grueling and has much higher stakes.
After a presentation, the investment banker asks the investor for an indication of
interest, based on the offering price range shown in the registration statement. The
investment banker records the number of shares each investor is willing to buy,
which is called book-building. As the roadshow progresses, an investment bank’s
“book” shows how demand for the offering is building. Many IPOs are oversub-
scribed, with investors wishing to purchase more shares than are available. In such
a case, the investment bank will allocate shares to the investors on a pro rata basis.4
3With the Internet, it is extremely easy to obtain the S-1 form, which typically has 50 to 200 pages of
financial statements in addition to a detailed discussion of the firm’s business, the risks and opportunities
the firm faces, its principal stockholders and managers, what will be done with the funds raised, and the
like. This statement is filed with the SEC and is immediately available, through the Internet, to investors.
The SEC staff reviews the filed S-1, and amendments may be issued (labeled S-1A, S-1B, etc.). The likely
range for the offering price will be reported—for example, $13 to $15 per share. If the market strengthens
or weakens while the stock is undergoing SEC review, the price may be increased or decreased right up
until the last day. The SEC Web site with these and other filings is http://www.sec.gov.
4Most underwriting agreements contain an “overallotment option” that permits the underwriter to
purchase additional shares from the company up to 15% of the issue size to cover promises made
to potential buyers. This is called a “green shoe” agreement because it was first used in the 1963 under-
writing of a company named Green Shoe.
Chapter 20: Initial Public Offerings, Investment Banking, and Financial Restructuring
793

If demand is high enough, the banks may increase the offering price; if demand is
low, they will either reduce the offering price or withdraw the IPO. Sometimes low
demand is specifically due to concern over the company’s future prospects, but some-
times low demand is caused by a fall in the general stock market. Thus, the timing of
the roadshow and offering date are important. As the old saying goes, sometimes it is
better to be lucky than good.
If all goes well with the roadshow, the investment bank will finalize the offering
price on the evening before the actual offering date.
The First Day of Trading
The first day of trading for many IPOs is wild and exciting. Table 20-1 shows the larg-
est first-day returns for IPOs in the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009.
Some stocks end the day with large gains, such as the 59.50% price increase of Open
Table, as shown in Line 1 of the table. Others have a sharp run-up and then fall back
by the end of the day. A few IPOs actually end their first day with a loss.
According to a study of IPOs during 1990–1998 by Professors Tim Loughran and
Jay Ritter, about 27.3% of the IPOs had an offer price that was lower than the low
range in their initial registration filing, and these stocks had an average first-day return
of 4.0%.5 Even though the average return was positive, 47% of these stocks actually
ended the day with a loss or no gain. About 48.4% of IPOs had an offering price that
was within the range of their initial filing. For such companies, the average first-day
return was 10.8%. As a result of high demand during the roadshow, 24.3% of IPOs
had a final offer price that exceeded their original range. These stocks had an average
first-day return of 31.9%. Overall, the average first-day return was 14.1% during
1990–1998, with 75% of all IPOs having a positive return. During 1999, the average
first-day return was an astronomical 70%!
You’re probably asking yourself two questions: (1) How can you get in on these deals?
(2) Why is the offering price so low? First, you probably can’t get the chance to buy an

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

IPO at its offering price, especially not a “hot” one. Virtually all sales go to institutional
investors and preferred retail customers. There are a few Web-based investment banks
who are trying to change this, such as the OpenIPO of W. R. Hambrecht & Co., but right
now it is difficult for small investors to get in on the better first-day IPOs.
Various theories have been put forth to explain IPO underpricing. As long as issuing
companies don’t complain, investment banks have strong incentives to underprice the
issue. First, underpricing increases the likelihood of oversubscription, which reduces
the risk to the underwriter. Second, most investors who get to purchase the IPO at
its offering price are preferred customers of the investment bank, and they became
preferred customers by generating lots of commissions in the investment bank’s sister
brokerage company. Therefore, the IPO is an easy way for the underwriter to reward
customers for past and future commissions. Third, the underwriter needs an honest
indication of interest when building the book prior to the offering, and underpricing
is a possible way to secure this information from the institutional investors.
But why don’t issuing companies object to underpricing? Some do, and they are seek-
ing alternative ways to issue securities, such as OpenIPO. However, most seem content
to leave some money on the table. The best explanations seem to be that (1) the
company wants to create excitement, and a price run-up on the first day does that; (2)
only a small percentage of the company’s stock is generally offered to the public, so
current stockholders lose less to underpricing than appears at first glance; and (3) IPO
companies generally plan to have additional offerings in the future, and the best way to
ensure future success is to have a successful IPO, which underpricing guarantees.
Although IPOs on average provide large first-day returns, their long-term returns
over the following 3 years are below average. For example, if you could not get in at
the IPO price but purchased a portfolio of IPO stocks on their second day of trading,
your 3-year return would have been lower than the return on a portfolio of similar
but seasoned stocks. In summary, the offering price appears to be too low, but the
first-day run-up is generally too high.
The Costs of Going Public
During recent years, virtually all investment banks have charged a 7% spread between
the price they pay the issuing company and the price at which they sell shares to the
public. Thus, they keep 7% of the offering price as their compensation. For example,
Rosetta Stone (RST), a developer of software for learning languages, went public in
2009. RST sold 3.125 million shares at an offering price of $18.00 per share to the public
(founders and other shareholders also sold 3.125 million of their own shares). In this
IPO, the underwriters’ direct compensation was $1.26 per share, which means that
the stock was sold at a price of $18 to the public but RST received only $18.00 −$1.26 =
$16.74 per share. For the 3.125 million shares issued by RST, these direct underwriting
costs totaled about $1.26(3.125) = $3.9375 million; the underwriters also made the same
amount on the shares they sold for founders and other existing shareholders.
But there are other direct costs, such as lawyers’ fees, accountants’ costs, printing,
engraving, and so on. RST estimated that these fees totaled about $3.5 million.
Last but not least are the indirect costs. The money left on the table, which is equal
to the number of shares multiplied by the difference in the closing price and the offer-
ing price, can be quite large. RST experienced a first-day run-up to $25.12 from an of-
fering price of $18.00, so its indirect costs totaled 3.125($25.12 −$18.00) = $22.25 million.
In addition, senior managers spend an enormous amount of time working on the IPO
rather than managing the business, which certainly carries a high cost even if it cannot
be easily measured.
Chapter 20: Initial Public Offerings, Investment Banking, and Financial Restructuring
795

Thus, Rosetta Stone received proceeds of 3.125($18 −$1.26) = $52.3 million, the
underwriters and their sales forces received $3.9 million, other expenses totaled about
$3.5 million, and $22.5 million was left on the table. There were undoubtedly other
indirect costs due to the diversion of the management team. As you can see, an IPO
is quite expensive.6
The Importance of the Secondary Market
An active secondary market after the IPO provides the pre-IPO shareholders with a
chance to convert some of their wealth into cash, makes it easier for the company to
raise additional capital later, makes employee stock options more attractive, and
makes it easier for the company to use its stock to acquire other companies. Without
an active secondary market, there would be little reason to have an IPO. Thus, com-
panies should try to ensure that their stock will trade in an active secondary market
before they incur the high costs of an IPO.
There are several types of secondary markets: physical stock exchanges, dealer
markets, and bulletin boards. We discuss each of these below.
The physical exchanges, such as the NYSE and AMEX, conduct their trading in an
actual location. In general, the NYSE and AMEX provide excellent liquidity. In order
to have its stock listed, a company must apply to an exchange, pay a relatively small fee,
and meet the exchange’s minimum requirements. These requirements relate to the size
of the company’s net income, its market value, and its “float,” which is the number of
shares outstanding and in the hands of outsiders (as opposed to the number held by
insiders, who generally do not actively trade their stock). Also, the company must agree
to disclose certain information to the exchange and to help the exchange track trading
patterns and thus ensure that no one is attempting to manipulate the stock’s price. The
size qualifications increase as a company moves from the AMEX to the NYSE.
Assuming a company qualifies, many believe that listing is beneficial to the company
and to its stockholders. Listed companies receive a certain amount of free advertising
and publicity, and their status as listed companies may enhance their prestige and rep-
utation, which often leads to higher sales. Investors respond favorably to increased
information, increased liquidity, and the confidence that the quoted price is not being
manipulated. Listing provides investors with these benefits, which may help managers
lower their firms’ cost of equity and increase the value of their stock.7
The advantages of physical exchanges have been eroded—some would say
eliminated—by computers and the Internet, which have benefited the dealer markets.
The primary equity dealer markets are administered by Nasdaq, and they include the
Nasdaq National Market and the Nasdaq SmallCap Market. Almost 85% of new IPO
stocks trade in these markets. Unlike the physical exchanges, these consist of a network
of dealers, with each dealer making a market in one or more stocks. A dealer makes a
market in a company’s stock by holding an inventory of the shares and then making of-
fers to buy or sell the stock. Many stocks have excellent liquidity in these markets and

remain there even though they easily meet the requirements for listing on the NYSE.
Examples include Microsoft, Intel, Apple, and Cisco Systems.
Investment banks generally agree to make a market in a company’s stock as part of
their IPO duties. The diligence with which they carry out this task can have a huge effect
on the stock’s liquidity in the secondary market and thus on the success of the IPO.
Although the requirements for listing on the Nasdaq National Market or Small-
Cap Market are not as stringent as for the NYSE, some companies fail to maintain
them and hence are “delisted.” For these companies, offers to buy or sell the stock
may be posted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an electronic bulletin board administered
by Nasdaq. However, there is very little liquidity in these stocks, and an IPO would
be considered a failure if the company’s stock ended up on the OTC Bulletin Board.
Regulating the Secondary Market
As we stated earlier, a liquid and crime-free secondary market is critical to the success of
an IPO or any other publicly traded security. So, in addition to regulating the process for
issuing securities, the Securities Exchange Commission also has responsibilities in the
secondary markets. The primary elements of SEC regulation are set forth below.
1. Stock exchanges. The SEC regulates all national stock exchanges,and companies
whose securities are listed on an exchange must file annual reports similar to the
registration statement with both the SEC and the exchange.
2. Insider trading. The SEC has control over trading by corporate insiders. Officers,
directors, and major stockholders must file monthly reports of changes in their
holdings of the stock of the corporation. Any short-term profits from such
transactions must be turned over to the corporation.
3. Market manipulation. The SEC has the power to prohibit manipulation by such
devices as pools (large amounts of money used to buy or sell stocks to artificially
affect prices) or wash sales (sales between members of the same group to record
artificial transaction prices).
4. Proxy statements. The SEC has control over the proxy statement and the way the
company uses it to solicit votes.
Control over credit used to buy securities is exercised by the Federal Reserve
Board through margin requirements, which specify the maximum percentage of
the purchase price someone can borrow. If a great deal of margin borrowing has per-
sisted, then a decline in stock prices can result in inadequate coverages. This could
force stockbrokers to issue margin calls, which require investors either to put up
more money or have their margined stock sold to pay off their loans. Such forced
sales further depress the stock market and thus can set off a downward spiral. The
required margin at the time a stock is purchased has been 50% since 1974 (subse-
quent “maintenance margins” are lower and are generally set by individual lenders).
The securities industry itself realizes the importance of stable markets, sound
brokerage firms, and the absence of stock manipulation.8 Therefore, the various ex-
changes work closely with the SEC to police transactions and to maintain the integ-
rity and credibility of the system. Similarly, the National Association of Securities
8It is illegal for anyone to attempt to manipulate the price of a stock. During the 1920s and earlier, syndi-
cates would buy and sell stocks back and forth at rigged prices so the public would believe that a particu-
lar stock was worth more or less than its true value. The exchanges, with the encouragement and support
of the SEC, utilize sophisticated computer programs to help spot any irregularities that suggest manipula-
tion, and they require disclosures to help identify manipulators. This same system helps to identify illegal
insider trading. It is now illegal to manipulate a stock’s price by spreading false news on the Internet.

Dealers (NASD) cooperates with the SEC to police trading in its dealer and OTC
markets. These industry groups also cooperate with regulatory authorities to set net
worth and other standards for securities firms, to develop insurance programs to pro-
tect the customers of failed brokerage houses, and the like.
In general, government regulation of securities trading, as well as industry self-
regulation, is designed to ensure that (1) investors receive information that is as accu-
rate as possible, (2) no one artificially manipulates the market price of a given stock,
and (3) corporate insiders do not take advantage of their position to profit in their
companies’ stocks at the expense of other stockholders. Neither the SEC, the state
regulators, nor the industry itself can prevent investors from making foolish decisions
or from having “bad luck,” but they can and do help investors obtain the best data
possible for making sound investment decisions.
Questionable IPO Practices
Among the many revelations to come out during 2002 regarding investment banking
was the practice by some investment banking houses of letting CEOs and other high-
ranking corporate executives in on “hot” IPOs. In these deals, the demand for the
new stock was far greater than supply at the offering price, so the investment banks
were virtually certain that the stock would soar far above the offering price.
Some investment banks systematically allocated shares of hot IPOs to executives of
companies that were issuing stocks and bonds—and thus generating fees to the banks
who underwrote the deals. Bernie Ebbers, the chairman and CEO of WorldCom—
one of the biggest sources of underwriting fees for investment banks—was given
huge allocations in hot IPOs, and he made millions on these deals. Ebbers is just
one example; a lot of this was going on in the late 1990s, at the height of the
tech/dot-com bubble.
Government regulators have been investigating this practice, called “spinning,”
and corporate executives and investment bankers have been charged with something
that amounts to a kickback scheme under which those executives who favored partic-
ular investment banks were rewarded with allocations in hot IPOs. Indeed, in 2003
ten Wall Street securities firms agreed to pay $1.4 billion in fines to settle charges
of investor abuse, including spinning. Although the practice may or may not be ille-
gal (this has yet to be determined), it is certainly unethical. The corporate executives
were paid to work for their stockholders, so they should have turned over any IPO
profits to their companies—not kept those profits for themselves.
This kind of unethical and perhaps illegal behavior may help to explain IPO under-
pricing and “money left on the table.” An executive might be more interested in getting
a future hot IPO allocation than in whether or not the company gets the best terms
from its investment bank. This situation would be exacerbated if the investment banks’
analysts overstated prospects for the company and thereby pumped up its price just
prior to the time when executives were to receive and exercise stock options.
In summary, we have a hard time justifying IPO underpricing during the late 1990s
on rational economic grounds. People have come up with explanations for why compa-
nies let their investment banks price their stocks too low in IPOs, but those reasons
seem rather weak. However, when coupled with what may have been a kickback
scheme, the underpricing is less puzzling (but ethically troubling). Before closing,
though, we should make it clear that relatively few corporate executives were corrupt.
However, just as one rotten apple can spoil an entire barrel, a few bad executives—
when combined with lax regulation—can help a bad practice become “the industry
standard” and thus become widespread.

20.4 EQUITY CARVE-OUTS: A SPECIAL TYPE OF IPO
In 2009, Bristol-Myers Squibb sold to the public about 15% of the equity in its
wholly owned subsidiary, Mead Johnson Nutrition. In this transaction, the subsidiary,
like the parent, became publicly owned, but the parent retained full control of the
subsidiary by keeping about 85% of the subsidiary’s common stock. (Parent compa-
nies typically retain at least 80% of the subsidiary’s common stock to preserve their
ability to file a consolidated tax return.) This type of transaction is called an equity
carve-out (or partial public offering, or spin-out).9 The market’s response to
Mead Johnson’s carve-out was positive—the stock price rose almost 10% during the
first day of trading. Equity carve-outs raise an interesting question: Why do carve-
out announcements typically result in stock price increases while the announcements
of new stock issues by parent corporations generally decrease stock prices?
One possible answer is that carve-outs facilitate the evaluation of corporate growth
opportunities on a line-of-business basis. Thus, analysts might have an easier time
evaluating Mead Johnson as a separate company than when it was a part of Bristol-
Myers. This also applies to providers of capital—Mead Johnson might be able to
raise capital more effectively as a stand-alone company because investors are better
able to evaluate its prospects. A third advantage to carve-outs is that they improve
the ability of the parent to offer incentives to a subsidiary’s managers. Thus, Mead
Johnson can now offer equity incentives to its managers based on its own stock price
rather than that of Bristol-Myers.
Equity carve-outs do have some associated costs. First, the underwriting commis-
sion involved in a carve-out is larger than for an equity offering by the parent. Sec-
ond, because an equity carve-out is a type of initial public offering, there is a
potential for underpricing the new offering. Third, key managers of the subsidiary
must spend a significant amount of time marketing the new stock. Fourth, there are
costs associated with the minority interest that is created in the carve-out. For exam-
ple, the subsidiary’s new board of directors must monitor all transactions between the
subsidiary and the parent to ensure that the minority investors are not being
exploited. Finally, there are additional costs such as annual reports, SEC filings, ana-
lyst presentations, and so on, which now must be borne both by parent and
subsidiary.

20.5 OTHER WAYS TO RAISE FUNDS
IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS
IPOs are exciting and play a vital role in stimulating the entrepreneurship and inno-
vation that are vital for economic growth. However, the funds raised through IPOs
are only a small fraction of the total funding that companies raise from commercial
banks and capital markets. We discuss other ways that firms raise cash from capital
markets in the following sections.10
Preliminary Decisions
Before raising capital, a firm must make some initial, preliminary decisions, which in-
clude the following.
1. Dollars to be raised. How much new capital is needed?
2. Type of securities used. Should common, preferred, bonds, hybrid securities, or a
combination be used? If common stock is to be issued, should it be done as a
preemptive rights offering to current shareholders or by a direct sale to the
general public?
3. Competitive bid versus a negotiated deal. Should the company simply offer a block of
its securities for sale to the highest bidder, or should it negotiate a deal with an
investment bank? These two procedures are called competitive bids and negoti-
ated deals, respectively. Only about 100 of the largest firms listed on the NYSE,
whose securities are already well known to the investment banking community, are
in a position to use the competitive bidding process. The investment banks must do
a great deal of investigative work (“due diligence”) to bid on an issue unless they
are already quite familiar with the firm, and such costs would be too high to make
it worthwhile unless the bank was sure of getting the deal. Therefore, except for
the largest firms, offerings of stock and bonds are generally on a negotiated basis.
4. Selection of an investment bank. Most deals are negotiated, so the firm must select an
investment bank. This can be an important decision for a firm that is going public.
On the other hand, an older firm that has already “been to market” will have an
established relationship with an investment bank. However, it is easy to change
banks if the firm is dissatisfied. Different investment banking houses are better
suited for different companies. For example, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley
are the leading tech-IPO underwriters. Investment banking houses sell new issues
largely to their own regular brokerage customers, so the nature of these customers
has a major effect on the ability of the house to do a good job for corporate issuers.
Finally, a major factor in choosing an underwriter is the reputation of the analyst
who will cover the stock in the secondary market, since a strong buy recommen-
dation from a well-respected analyst can trigger a sharp price run-up.
Seasoned Equity Offerings
When a company with publicly traded stock issues additional shares, this is called a
seasoned equity offering, also known as a secondary or follow-on offering. Because the
stock is already publicly traded, the offering price will be based upon the existing
10For an excellent discussion of the various procedures used to raise capital, see Jay R. Ritter, “Investment
Banking and Securities Issuance,” in North-Holland Handbook of the Economics of Finance, George Constan-
tinides, Milton Harris, and René Stulz, eds. (Amsterdam: North-Holland, 2002). Also see Claudio Lode-
rer, John W. Cooney, and Leonard D. Van Drunen, “The Price Elasticity of Demand for Common
Stock,” Journal of Finance, June 1991, pp. 621–651.

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

market price of the stock. Typically, the investment bank buys the securities at a pre-
scribed number of points below the closing price on the last day of registration. For
example, suppose that in August 2010 the stock of Microwave Telecommunications
Inc. (MTI) had a price of $28.60 per share and that the stock had traded between
$25 and $30 per share during the previous 3 months. Suppose further that MTI
and its underwriter agreed that the investment bank would buy 10 million new shares
at $1 per share below the closing price on the last day of registration. If the stock
closed at $25 on the day the SEC released the issue, then MTI would receive $24
per share. Typically, such agreements have an escape clause that provides for the
contract to be voided if the price of the securities drops below some predetermined
figure. In the illustrative case, this “upset” price might be set at $24 per share. Thus,
if the closing price of the shares on the last day of registration had been $23.50, MTI
would have had the option of withdrawing from the agreement.
The investment bank will have an easier job if the issue is priced relatively low.
However, the issuer naturally wants as high a price as possible. A conflict of interest
on price therefore arises between the investment bank and the issuer. If the issuer is
financially sophisticated and makes comparisons with similar security issues, the
investment bank will be forced to price close to the market.
As we discussed in Chapter 15, the announcement of a new stock offering by a
mature firm is often taken as a negative signal—if the firm’s prospects were good,
management would not want to issue new stock and thus share the rosy future with
new stockholders. Therefore, the announcement of a new offering is taken as bad
news. Consequently, the price will probably fall when the announcement is made,
so the offering price will probably have to be set at a price below the pre-
announcement market price.
One final point is that if negative signaling effects drive down the price of the stock then
all shares outstanding, not just the new shares, are affected. Thus, if MTI’s stock should fall
from $28.60 to $25 per share as a result of the financing and if the price remains at the
new level, then the company would incur a loss of $3.60 on each of the 50 million
shares previously outstanding, or a total market value loss of $180 million. This loss,
like underwriting expenses, is a flotation cost, and it should be considered as a cost as-
sociated with the stock issue. Of course, if the company’s prospects really were poorer
than investors thought, then the price decline would have occurred sooner or later any-
way. On the other hand, if the company’s prospects are really not all that bad (the sig-
nal was incorrect), then over time MTI’s price should move back to its previous level.
Yet even if the price does revert to its former level, there will have been a transfer of
wealth from the original shareholders to the new shareholders. To prevent this, com-
panies occasionally sell additional shares of stock through a rights offering (also called a
preemptive rights offering), which we explain in Web Extension 20A.
Shelf Registrations
The selling procedures described so far, including the 20-day waiting period after
registration with the SEC, apply to most security sales. However, under the SEC’s
Rule 415, large, well-known public companies that issue securities frequently may
file a master registration statement with the SEC and then update it with a short-
form statement just prior to each individual offering. Under this procedure, a com-
pany can decide at 10 a.m. to sell securities and have the sale completed before noon.
This procedure is known as shelf registration because, in effect, the company puts
its new securities “on the shelf” and then sells them to investors when it feels the
market is “right.” Firms with less than $150 million in stock held by outside investors

cannot use shelf registrations. The rationale for this distinction is to protect investors
who may not be able to obtain adequate financial data about a little-known company
in the short time between announcement of a shelf issue and its sale. Shelf registra-
tions have two advantages over standard registrations: (1) lower flotation costs and (2)
more control over the timing of the issue.11
Private Placements
In a private placement, securities are sold to one or a few investors, generally institu-
tional investors. Private placements are most common with bonds, but they also
occur with stocks. The primary advantages of private placements are (1) lower flota-
tion costs and (2) greater speed, since the shares do not have to go through the SEC
registration process.
Sometimes it is a privately held firm that makes a private placement. For example,
Mars Inc., the family-owned candy maker, placed over $1.5 billion of private debt in
2008. At other times it is a public company making a private placement. For example,
Active Power, which provides flywheel-based backup power systems to ensure unin-
terruptible power supplies, raised $3 million in 2009 by selling stock directly to
Kinderhook Partners. Because Active Power is a publicly held company, this is called
a private placement of public equity, or a PIPE. The most common type of
private placement occurs when a company places securities directly with a financial
institution, often an insurance company or a pension fund.
Many large companies make equity investments in suppliers or in start-up compa-
nies that are developing a related technology. For example, Microsoft’s 2008 annual
report showed $5.6 billion of investments in the common stock of other companies,
including a $240 million investment in Facebook.
A potential disadvantage of a private placement is that if the securities are not
registered with the SEC, they cannot be resold except to another large, “sophisticated”
purchaser. However, many institutions meet this qualification, so there is a large
potential market for the securities. In addition, companies are increasingly choosing
to register the securities they privately place in order to improve their marketability
after placement. With improved marketability, private placements are popular: more
than $28 billion of debt was placed privately in the United States during 2008.
Securitization
In Chapter 1 we discussed securitization in the context of mortgage markets, and now we
discuss it in the context of capital formation. As the term is generally used, a security
refers to a publicly traded financial instrument as opposed to a privately placed instrument.
Thus, securities have greater liquidity than otherwise similar instruments that are not
traded in an open market. In recent years, procedures have been developed to securitize
various types of debt instruments, thus increasing their liquidity, lowering the cost of
capital to borrowers, and generally increasing the efficiency of the financial markets.
Securitization occurs in two ways. First, a debt instrument that formerly was rarely
traded becomes actively traded, usually because the size of the market increases and the
terms of the debt instrument become more standardized. For example, this has occurred
with commercial paper and junk bonds, both of which are now considered to be securities.
Second, a security can be created by the pledging of specific assets. This is called
asset securitization, resulting in the creation of asset-backed securities. The

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

oldest type of asset securitization was in the mortgage industry, as we described in
Chapter 1. Today, many different types of assets are used as collateral, including
auto loans, credit card balances, and even the royalties from David Bowie’s music!
The asset securitization process involves the pooling and repackaging of loans se-
cured by relatively homogeneous, small-dollar assets (such as an automobile) into liq-
uid securities. Usually several different financial institutions are involved, with each
playing a different functional role. For example, an auto dealer might sell a car, the
auto manufacturer’s lending operation might originate the loan, an investment bank
might pool similar car loans and structure the security, a federal agency might insure
against credit risk, a second investment bank might sell the securities, and a pension
fund might supply the final capital.
A similar process can occur with equipment leases. For example, CIT Group pro-
vides lease financing for equipment used by small and mid-sized companies. In 2009,
CIT sold $954 million in notes securitized by equipment leases. The notes qualify for
the Fed’s Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), which means that the
investor, usually a bank, can use these notes as collateral for loans from the New
York Fed. If you trace the money, it could easily be the case that the Fed is financing
a new dishwashing machine for a restaurant in Milwaukee.
The process of securitization lowers costs and increases the availability of funds to
borrowers, with the risk being transferred to the investor. But as we described in
Chapter 1, if loans are originated to borrowers with high credit risk, then the cash
flows received by the ultimate investor are likely to be low.

ROLE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS

age debt offerings. In other words, investment banks help firms raise capital, and lots

Bowie Bonds Ch-Ch-Change Asset Securitization
In 1997, asset securitization was already booming, with
bonds being backed by mortgages, car loans, credit cards,
and student loans. But David Bowie juiced it up even more
by issuing Bowie Bonds, which were backed by future roy-
alties on more than 250 of his older songs. These bonds
had a 10-year maturity and paid an interest rate of 7.9%.
In a private placement, Prudential Insurance bought the
entire issue for $55 million in order to receive a whopping
$4.345 million in interest payment each year (assuming the
songs generated enough in royalties). At the time of issue,
Moody’s Investor Service was bullish on Bowie, since it
gave his issue a rating of A3, high enough that the bonds
were issued with an interest rate only 1.53 percentage
points higher than 10-year Treasury bonds. However, in
response to declining industry sales, Moody’s down-
graded the bonds to Baa3 in 2004. The bonds matured in
2007 and royalties reverted to Bowie.

during 2008, and that was a down year. Investment banks also engage in other activi-
ties. Because of increasingly relaxed regulations that culminated with the repeal of
the Glass-Stegall Act in 1999, there is no longer a clear delineation between invest-
ment banks, brokerage firms, and commercial banks. In the following sections we
discuss activities that are primarily associated with the investment banking arm of
the financial conglomerates.
Mergers & Acquisitions
Many investment banks are actively involved in mergers and acquisitions (M&As)
through three activities.
1. Matchmaking. Investment banks often find potential targets for acquirers, some-
times earning a finder’s fee if the deal is successful.
2. Advising. Both the target and acquirer must document that the deal is “fair” for
their stockholders by performing a due diligence valuation analysis. Investment
banks often provide consulting advice during this stage of the M&A.
3. Underwriting. Most M&As require that new capital be raised. Investment banks
underwrite these new issues.
Underwriting is the most lucrative of these activities, but if the deal falls through then
no new securities will be underwritten. This makes one wonder how unbiased invest-
ment bankers are when finding targets and providing advice during negotiations.
Securitization
Investment banks often provide advice to financial institutions regarding the securitiza-
tion of the institutions’ loans or leases. In fact, investment banks frequently provide
turnkey service by purchasing an institution’s loans, securitizing the loans, and selling
the newly created securities. Thus, the investment bank becomes the securitizer, not
just the advisor. During the build-up to the global economic crisis, many investment
banks were unable to sell all the mortgage-backed securities they created and were
left holding some of them in their own portfolios. When the original borrowers began
defaulting, the values of these securities owned by the investment banks plummeted,
contributing to the downfall of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch.
Asset Management
Many investment banking companies create investment funds, such as a limited part-
nership (LP) that might invest in real estate in developing nations or an LP that
might seek to exploit mispricing in various asset classes. In other words, they run

their own hedge funds, which can be quite lucrative. Like any other hedge fund, they
raise capital for these funds from a variety of sources. But unlike other hedge funds,
investment banks often have access to a special source—their own clients!
Here is how that works. Many investment banks have “wealth management” divi-
sions or subsidiaries that provide investment advice to wealthy individuals or institutions
such as pension funds. As advisors, they recommend investment strategies, including
specific investments, to their clients. Some of these investments might be individual se-
curities or mutual funds managed by other organizations. However, some of the recom-
mended investments might be funds managed by the advisor’s own investment bank.
These might be great investments, but there is at least the appearance of a conflict of
interest when advisors recommend funds managed by their own company.
In addition to managing clients’ money, investment banks also invest their own
money (actually, the money of their own stockholders and creditors) in financial securi-
ties. Sometimes the choice of investment is intentional, but sometimes it is not—as we
mentioned previously, some investment banks were unable to sell all the mortgage-
backed securities they created and were left holding some in their own portfolios.
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
Investment Banks and the Global Economic Crisis
There is plenty of blame to spread around for the cause
of the global economic crisis, but investment banks cer-
tainly played a special role.
Among their many strategic errors, investment banks
morphed from organizations that earned money primar-
ily through fee-generating activities into organizations
that earned money as highly levered investors. Investing
is an inherently risky business, especially when the in-
vestments include extremely complicated mortgage-
backed securities and credit default swaps. Investing be-
comes even riskier when you borrow $33 for every $1 of
equity, as many investment banks did. This strategy
works great if you earn more than you owe on your debt
because leverage magnifies returns, and these magnified
returns generated gigantic bonuses for senior managers
at the investment banks. But it doesn’t take too much of a
decline in asset values and investment income to cause
failure. In essence, the investment bankers were willing
to risk it all for the chance of mind-boggling bonuses.
In addition to selling toxic investments (such as
complex mortgage-backed securities) to pension funds
and other financial institutions, the interconnectedness
of failing investment banks threatened the entire world
economy. Lehman Brothers had been borrowing short-
term in the commercial paper market and investing
long-term in risky assets. When those assets failed, Leh-
man defaulted on its commercial paper obligations,
many of which were owned by money market funds.
This caused some funds, like the large Reserve fund,
to “break the buck,” which means that their reported
net asset value dropped below $1, something that
none of their investors ever expected. This led to a run
on many money market funds and a huge disruption in
the financial commercial paper markets.
Investment banks also were major players in the
market for credit default swaps (CDS). If investment
banks defaulted on their CDS, then it would cause po-
tentially bankrupting financial distress at many other fi-
nancial institutions.
Because many investment banks are subsidiaries of
bank holding companies, the failure of the investment
banks threatened the viability of the holding company
and its other subsidiaries, such as commercial banks,
which began limiting the credit they provided to their bor-
rowers. In short, the financial crisis spread to the nonfi-
nancial sector as financial institutions began cutting back
on the credit they provided to the nonfinancial sector.
The investment banking landscape has certainly
changed
during
the
global
economic
crisis.
Bear
Stearns was acquired by JP Morgan, Lehman Brothers
went bankrupt and was sold piecemeal, Merrill Lynch
was acquired by Bank of America, and several invest-
ment banks, including Goldman Sachs, rechartered
themselves as banks to qualify for TARP funds.

Trading Operations
Many investment banking companies have trading operations through which they
actively trade on the behalf or clients. For example, a client might need help in sell-
ing a large block of debt. Also, investment banking companies usually make a market
in the stock of companies that they took public. Thus, these activities can be viewed
as services provided to clients.
However, many investment banks also view their trading operations as profit cen-
ters. In other words, the traders try to buy low and sell high, and in the process they
sometimes accumulate large positions that become difficult to unload.

20.7 THE DECISION TO GO PRIVATE
In a going private transaction, the entire equity of a publicly held firm is purchased
by a small group of investors, with the firm’s current senior management usually
maintaining or increasing their ownership stakes. The outside investors typically
place directors on the now-private firm’s board and arrange for the financing needed
to purchase the publicly held stock. When the financing involves substantial borrow-
ing, as it usually does, it is known as a leveraged buyout (LBO). In some cases, the
current management group raises the financing and acquires all of the equity of the
company; these are called management buyouts (MBOs).
The outside equity in a buyout often comes from a private equity (PE) fund,
which is a limited liability partnership created to own and manage investments in
nontraded equity. Private equity funds raise money from wealthy investors and insti-
tutions like university endowments, pension funds, and insurance companies. The PE
funds then take public firms private or invest in firms that already are privately held.
Most PE funds plan on improving the companies’ performance and then harvesting
their investments by selling the company, perhaps in an IPO.12
Regardless of the deal’s structure, going private initially affects the right-hand side
of the balance sheet, the liabilities and capital, and not the assets: going private sim-
ply rearranges the ownership structure. Thus, going private involves no obvious op-
erating economies, yet the new owners are generally willing to pay a large premium
over the stock’s current price in order to take the firm private. For example, prior to
its acquisition by Columbia, the managers of Hospital Corporation of America
(HCA) paid $51 a share to outside (public) shareholders although the stock was sell-
ing for only about $31 before the LBO offer was made. It is hard to believe that the
managers of a company, who have the best information about the firm’s potential
profitability, would knowingly pay too much for the firm. Thus, HCA’s managers
must have regarded the firm as being grossly undervalued or else thought that they
could significantly boost the firm’s value under private ownership. This suggests that
going private can increase the value of some firms sufficiently to enrich both man-
agers and public stockholders. Other large companies going private recently include
Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. (2008), Chrysler (2008), The Tribune Company (2007), Univi-
sion (2006), Kinder Morgan (2006), and GMAC (2006).

The primary advantages to going private are (1) administrative cost savings, (2) in-
creased managerial incentives, (3) increased managerial flexibility, (4) increased share-
holder oversight and participation, and (5) increased use of financial leverage, which
of course reduces taxes. We discuss each of these advantages in more detail in the
following paragraphs.
1. Administrative cost savings. Because going private takes the stock of a firm out of
public hands, it saves on the time and costs associated with securities registration,
annual reports, SEC and exchange reporting, responding to stockholder inqui-
ries, and so on.
2. Increased managerial incentives. Managers’ increased ownership and equity incen-
tive plans mean that managers benefit more directly from their own efforts;
hence managerial efficiency tends to increase after going private. If the firm is
highly successful then its managers can easily see their personal net worth in-
crease twentyfold, but if the firm fails then its managers end up with nothing.
3. Increased managerial flexibility. Managers at private companies do not have to
worry about what a drop in the next quarter’s earnings will do to the firm’s stock
price, so they can focus on long-term, strategic actions that ultimately will have
the greatest positive impact on the firm’s value. Managerial flexibility concerning
asset sales is also greater in a private firm, since such sales need not be justified to
a large number of shareholders with potentially diverse interests.
4. Increased shareholder oversight and participation. Going private typically results in
replacing a dispersed, largely passive group of public shareholders with a small
group of investors who take a much more active role in managing the firm.
These new equity investors have a substantial position in the private firm; hence
they have a greater motivation to monitor management and to provide incentives
to management than do the typical stockholders of a public corporation. Further,
the new nonmanagement equity investors—frequently private equity firms, such
as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company (KKR), Carlyle Group, or Blackstone
Group—are typically represented on the board, and they bring sophisticated in-
dustry and financial expertise and hard-nosed attitudes to the new firm.
5. Increased financial leverage. Going private usually entails a drastic increase in the
firm’s use of debt financing, which has two effects. First, the firm’s taxes are re-
duced because of the increase in deductible interest payments, so more of the
operating income flows through to investors. Second, the increased debt service
requirements force managers to hold costs down to ensure that the firm has suf-
ficient cash flow to meet its obligations—a highly leveraged firm simply cannot
afford any fat.
One might ask why all firms are not privately held. The answer is that, although there
are real benefits to private ownership, there are also benefits to being publicly owned.
Most notably, public corporations have access to large amounts of equity capital on
favorable terms, and for most companies, the advantage of access to public capital mar-
kets dominates the advantages of going private. Also, note that most companies that go
private end up going public again after several years of operation as private firms. For
example, Celanese AG, a global chemical company, went public in 1999. It was taken
private in 2004 by Blackstone Capital Partners, a PE firm, and taken public in 2005.

20.8 MANAGING THE MATURITY STRUCTURE OF DEBT
Chapters 15 and 26 describe the capital structure decision. But after a firm chooses
the total amount of debt in its capital structure, it must still choose the maturities of
the various securities that make up its debt. The following sections explain the factors
associated with the choice of maturity structure.
Maturity Matching
Assume that Consolidated Tools, a Cincinnati machine tool manufacturer, made the
decision to float a $25 million nonconvertible bond issue to help finance its 2010 cap-
ital budget. It must choose a maturity for the issue, taking into consideration the
shape of the yield curve, management’s own expectations about future interest rates,
and the maturity of the assets being financed. To illustrate how asset maturities affect
the choice of debt maturities, suppose Consolidated’s capital projects consist primar-
ily of new milling machinery. This machinery has an expected economic life of
10 years (even though it falls into the MACRS 5-year class life). Should Consolidated
use debt with a 5-year, 10-year, 20-year, 30-year, or some other maturity?
Note that some of the new capital will come from common equity, which is per-
manent capital. On the other hand, debt maturities can be specified at the time of
issue. If Consolidated financed its capital budget with 10-year sinking fund bonds, it
would be matching asset and liability maturities. The cash flows resulting from the
new machinery could be used to make the interest and sinking fund payments on
the issue, so the bonds would be retired as the machinery wore out. If Consolidated
used 1-year debt, then it would have to pay off this debt with cash flows derived from
assets other than the machinery in question.
Of course, the 1-year debt could probably be rolled over year after year, out to the
10-year asset maturity. However, if interest rates rose then Consolidated would have
to pay a higher rate when it rolled over its debt, and if the company experienced dif-
ficulties then it might not be able to refund the debt at a reasonable rate. Conversely,
if it used 20-year or 30-year debt, it would have to service the debt long after the
assets that were purchased with the funds had been scrapped and had ceased provid-
ing cash flows. This would worry lenders.
For all these reasons, the safest all-around financing strategy is to match debt maturities
with asset maturities. In recognition of this fact, firms generally place great emphasis
on maturity matching, and this factor often dominates the debt maturity decision.
Some firms use zero coupon bonds as a tool in matching maturities. We explain
these bonds in Web Extension 5A.
Effects of Interest Rate Levels and Forecasts
Financial managers also consider interest rate levels and forecasts, both absolute and
relative, when making financing decisions. For example, if long-term interest rates
are high by historical standards and are expected to fall, managers will be reluctant
to issue long-term debt, which would lock in those costs for long periods. We already
know that one solution to this problem is to use a call provision, since callability per-
mits refunding should interest rates drop. This flexibility comes at a cost, however,
because of the call premium and also because the firm must set a higher coupon on
callable debt. Floating-rate debt could be used, but another alternative would be to
finance with short-term debt whenever long-term rates are historically high, and
then, assuming that interest rates subsequently fall, sell a long-term issue to replace
the short-term debt. Of course, this strategy has its risks: If interest rates move even
higher, the firm will be forced to renew its short-term debt at higher and higher rates

coupon bonds.

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

or to replace the short-term debt with a long-term bond that costs even more than it
would have when the original decision was made.
We could argue that capital markets are efficient and hence that it’s not possible
to predict future interest rates, because these rates will be determined by information
that is not now known. Thus, under the efficient markets hypothesis, it would be un-
productive for firms to try to “beat the market” by forecasting future capital costs and
then acting on these forecasts. According to this view, financial managers ought to
arrange their capital structures in such a manner that they can ride out almost any
economic storm, and this generally calls for (1) using some “reasonable” mix of debt
and equity and (2) using debt with maturities that more or less match the maturities
of the assets being financed.
Information Asymmetries
In Chapter 5, we discussed bond ratings and the effects of changes in ratings on the cost
and availability of capital. If a firm’s current financial condition is poor, then its managers
may be reluctant to issue new long-term debt because (1) a new debt issue would proba-
bly trigger a review by the rating agencies, and (2) debt issued when a firm is in poor
financial shape would probably cost more and be subject to more severe restrictive cove-
nants than debt issued from strength. Furthermore, in Chapters 15 and 26 we point out
that firms are reluctant to use new common stock financing, especially when this might
be taken as a negative signal. Thus, a firm that is in a weakened condition but whose
internal forecasts indicate greater financial strength in the future would be inclined to
delay long-term financing of any type until things improved. Such a firm would be mo-
tivated to use short-term debt even to finance long-term assets, with the expectation of
replacing the short-term debt in the future with cheaper, higher-rated long-term debt.
Conversely, a firm that is strong now but that forecasts a potentially bad time in
the period just ahead would be motivated to finance long term now rather than to
wait. Each of these scenarios implies either that the capital markets are inefficient or
that investors do not have the same information regarding the firm’s future as does
its financial manager. The second situation undoubtedly is true at times, and the first
one possibly is true at times.
The firm’s earnings outlook and the extent to which forecasted higher earnings
per share are reflected in stock prices also have an effect on the choice of securities.
If a successful R&D program has just been concluded and causes management to
forecast higher earnings than do most investors, then the firm would not want to
issue common stock. It would use debt and then, once earnings rise and push up
the stock price, sell common stock to restore the capital structure to its target level.
Amount of Financing Required
Obviously, the amount of financing required will influence the financing decision.
This is mainly because of flotation costs. A $5 million debt financing, which is small
in Wall Street terms, would most likely be done with a term loan or a privately
placed bond issue, whereas a firm seeking $2 billion of new debt would most likely
use a public offering of long-term bonds.
Availability of Collateral
Generally, secured debt is less costly than unsecured debt. Thus, firms with large
amounts of marketable fixed assets are likely to use a relatively large amount of long-
term debt, especially mortgage bonds. Additionally, each year’s financing decision would
be influenced by the amount of qualified assets available as security for new bonds.

20.9 REFUNDING OPERATIONS
A great deal of corporate debt was sold during the late 1990s. Because the call
protection on much of this debt has ended and because interest rates have fallen since
the debt was issued, many companies are analyzing the pros and cons of bond refund-
ings. The basic approach is to estimate the incremental after-tax cash flows associated
with the refunding. The cash flows in a refunding decision are due to the presence of
debt, so the cash flows should be discounted at the after-tax cost of debt.
The best way to examine the refunding decision is through an example. Microchip
Computer Company has a $60 million bond issue outstanding that has a 12% annual
coupon interest rate and 20 years remaining to maturity. This issue, which was sold 5
years ago, had flotation costs of $3 million that the firm has been amortizing on a
straight-line basis over the 25-year original life of the issue. The bond has a call provision
that makes it possible for the company to retire the issue at this time by calling the bonds
in at a 10% call premium. Investment banks have assured the company that it could sell
an additional $60 million to $70 million worth of new 20-year bonds at an interest rate of
9%. To ensure that the funds required to pay off the old debt will be available, the new
bonds will be sold 1 month before the old issue is called; thus, for 1 month the company
will have to pay interest on two issues. Current short-term interest rates are 6%. Predic-
tions are that long-term interest rates are unlikely to fall below 9%.13 Flotation costs on a
new refunding issue will amount to $2,650,000, and the firm’s marginal federal-plus-state
tax rate is 40%. Should the company refund the $60 million of 12% bonds?
The following steps outline the decision process; they are summarized in the
spreadsheet in Figure 20-1. This spreadsheet is part of the spreadsheet model, Ch20
Tool Kit.xls, developed for this chapter. The range of cells from A17 through H23
shows input data needed for the analysis, which were just discussed.

After tax : $6;000;000ð1 −TÞ ¼ $6;000;000ð0:6Þ
¼ $3;600;000
Although Microchip must spend $6 million on the call premium, this is a deductible
expense in the year the call is made. Because the company is in the 40% tax bracket, it
saves $2.4 million in taxes; therefore, the after-tax cost of the call is only $3.6 million.

Flotation costs on new issue: Flotation costs on the new issue will be

Since the annual flotation cost tax effects and interest savings occur for the next 20 years, they represent 
annuities.  To evaluate this project, we must find the present values of these savings.  Using the function
wizard  and solving for present value, we find that the present values of these annuities are:
Hence, the net present value of this bond refunding project will be the sum of the initial outlay and the
present values of the annual flotation cost tax effects and interest savings.

¼ $132;500
Since our spreadsheet shows dollars in thousands, this number appears as $132.5 on the
spreadsheet. Because the firm is in the 40% tax bracket, it has a tax savings of
$132,500(0.4) = $53,000 a year for 20 years. This is an annuity of $53,000 for 20 years.
Row 37.
Tax benefits lost on flotation costs on the old issue: The firm, however, will no
longer receive a tax deduction of $120,000 a year for 20 years, so it loses an after-tax
benefit of $48,000 a year.
Row 38.
Net amortization tax effect: The after-tax difference between the amortiza-
tion tax effects of flotation on the new and old issues is $5,000 a year for 20 years.
Step 3: Calculate the Annual Interest Savings
Row 41.
Interest on old bond, after tax: The annual after-tax interest on the old issue
is $4.32 million:
ð$60;000;000Þð0:12Þð0:6Þ ¼ $4;320;000
14The investment outlay (in this case, $5,470,000) is usually obtained by increasing the amount of the
new bond issue. In the example given, the new issue would be $65,470,000. However, the interest on the
additional debt should not be deducted at Step 3 because the $5,470,000 itself will be deducted at Step 4. If
additional interest on the $5,470,000 were deducted at Step 3 then interest would, in effect, be deducted
twice. The situation here is exactly like that in regular capital budgeting decisions. Even though some
debt may be used to finance a project, interest on that debt is not subtracted when developing the annual
cash flows. Instead, the annual cash flows are discounted at the project’s cost of capital.

PV of the benefits: The PV of the annual after-tax flotation cost benefit can
be found using a financial calculator, with N = 20, I/YR = 5.4, PMT = 5000, and FV
= 0. Solving for PV shows that the flotation cost savings have a present value equal to
$60,251. The PV of the $1,080,000 annual after-tax interest savings is found with N
= 20, I/YR = 5.4, PMT = 1080000 and FV = 0; solving for PV shows that the present
value of after-tax interest cost savings is $13,014,174.

TVA Ratchets Down Its Interest Expenses
In 1998, TVA raised $575 million in 30-year debt. If it
had issued fixed-rate debt, it would be stuck with high
coupon payments if interest rates in the market fall. If it
had issued floating-rate debt, it would be stuck with
high coupon payments if interest rates rise. If it had is-
sued callable debt, then it could refinance if interest
rates fall. But the costs of refunding are high, and TVA
would have to agonize over the decision of whether to
refund or wait in the hopes that rates will fall. None of
these three choices seemed desirable, so TVA issued a
new type of security that finesses these problems.
The new bonds are officially called Putable Auto-
matic Rate Reset Securities (PARRS), but they are com-
monly known as ratchet bonds. These bonds have a
feature that resets the coupon rate each year, starting
in 2003, to 94 basis points over the rate on the prevail-
ing 30-year Treasury bond—provided the new coupon
would be lower than the ratchet bond’s current coupon.
In other words, the coupon on the bond will fall if inter-
est rates fall, but it will never increase from year to year,
allowing TVA to lock in the lowest interest rates that
prevail during the bond’s life. In essence, TVA gets to
refund its debt in any year when rates fall, whence the
term “ratchet."
The 94-basis-point spread is higher than the spread
over Treasuries that normally exists on TVA’s noncall-
able bonds, given its bond rating. However, if the bond
rating deteriorates, then investors can “put” the bond
by selling it back to TVA. The net effect is that investors
are exposed to interest rate risk but not to credit risk,
and they are compensated for interest rate risk by the
relatively high spread.
These bonds were originally issued with a 6.750%
coupon, and on the first reset date (June 1, 2003) the
rate ratcheted down to 5.952%, reflecting the decline in
long-term interest rates since 1998. By June 1, 2009,
long-term interest rates had fallen so that the coupon
rate on the PARRS was ratcheted down to 4.728%.

Because the net present value of the refunding is positive, it would be profitable to
refund the old bond issue.
We can summarize the data shown in Figure 20-1 using a time line (amounts in
thousands) as shown below:

Several other points should be made. First, because the cash flows are based on
differences between contractual obligations, their risk is the same as that of the un-
derlying obligations. Therefore, the present values of the cash flows should be found
by discounting at the firm’s least risky rate—its after-tax cost of marginal debt. Sec-
ond, since the refunding operation is advantageous to the firm, it must be disadvan-
tageous to bondholders; they must give up their 12% bonds and reinvest in new ones
yielding 9%. This points out the danger of the call provision to bondholders, and it
also explains why noncallable bonds command higher prices than callable bonds with
the same coupon rate. Third, although it is not emphasized in the example, we as-
sumed that the firm raises the investment required to undertake the refunding oper-
ation (the $5,470,000 shown in Row 33 of Figure 20-1) as debt. This should be
feasible because the refunding operation will improve the interest coverage ratio,
even though a larger amount of debt is outstanding. Fourth, we set up our example
in such a way that the new issue had the same maturity as the remaining life of
the old one. Often, the old bonds have a relatively short time to maturity (say, 5 to
10 years), whereas the new bonds have a much longer maturity (say, 25 to 30 years).
In such a situation, the analysis should be set up similarly to a replacement chain anal-
ysis in capital budgeting, which was discussed in Chapter 10. Fifth, refunding decisions
are well suited for analysis with a computer spreadsheet program. Spreadsheets such as
the one shown in Figure 20-1 are easy to set up, and once the model has been con-
structed, it is easy to vary the assumptions (especially the assumption about the interest
rate on the refunding issue) and to see how such changes affect the NPV.
One final point should be addressed: Although our analysis shows that the refund-
ing would increase the firm’s value, would refunding at this time truly maximize the
firm’s expected value? If interest rates continue to fall then the company might be
better off waiting, for this would increase the NPV of the refunding operation even
more. The mechanics of calculating the NPV in a refunding are easy, but the deci-
sion of when to refund is not at all simple because it requires a forecast of future in-
terest rates. Thus, the final decision on refunding now versus waiting for a possibly
more favorable time is a judgment call.
To illustrate the timing decision, assume Microchip’s managers forecast that long-
term interest rates have a 50% probability of remaining at their present level of 9%
over the next year. However, there is a 25% probability that rates could fall to 7%
and a 25% probability they could rise to 11%. Further, assume that short-term rates
are expected to remain 3 percentage points below long-term rates and that the call
premium would be reduced by 5% if the call were delayed for 1 year.
The refunding analysis could then be repeated, as previously, but as if it were a
year later. Thus, the old bonds would have only 19 years remaining to maturity.

Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

We performed the analysis and found the NPV distribution of refunding 1 year
from now:

$17,947,071

7,390,083

(1,359,939)
At first blush, it would seem reasonable to calculate the expected NPV of refunding next
year in terms of the probability distribution. However, that would not be correct. If in-
terest rates did rise to 11%, Microchip would not refund the issue; therefore, the actual
NPV if rates rose to 11% would be zero. The expected NPV from refunding 1 year
hence is therefore 0.25($17,947,071) + 0.50($7,390,083) + 0.25($0) = $8,181,809, versus
$7,604,425 if refunding occurred today.
Even though the expected NPV of refunding in 1 year is higher, Microchip’s
managers would probably decide to refund today. The $7,604,425 represents a sure
increase in firm value, whereas the $8,181,809 is risky. Also, proper comparison re-
quires that the $8,181,809 be discounted back 1 year to today. Microchip’s managers
should opt to delay refunding only if the expected NPV from later refunding is suffi-
ciently above today’s sure NPV to compensate for the risk and time value involved.
Clearly, the decision to refund now versus refund later is complicated by the fact
that there would be numerous opportunities to refund in the future rather than just a
single opportunity 1 year from now. Furthermore, the decision must be based on a
large set of interest rate forecasts, a daunting task in itself. Fortunately, financial
managers making bond refunding decisions can now use the values of derivative se-
curities to estimate the value of the bond issue’s embedded call option. If the call op-
tion is worth more than the NPV of refunding today, the issue should not be
immediately refunded. Rather, the issuer should either delay the refunding to take
advantage of the information obtained from the derivative market or actually create
a derivative transaction to lock in the value of the call option.15

20.10 MANAGING THE RISK STRUCTURE
OF DEBT WITH PROJECT FINANCING
Historically, many large projects such as the Alaska pipeline have been financed by
what is called project financing.16 We can only present an overview of the concept,
for in practice it involves complicated provisions and can take on many forms.

Project financing has been used to finance energy explorations, oil tankers, re-
fineries, and electric generating plants. Generally, one or more firms will sponsor
the project, putting up the required equity capital, while the remainder of the fi-
nancing is furnished by lenders or lessors. Most often, a separate legal entity is
formed to operate the project. Normally, the project’s creditors do not have full
recourse against the sponsors. In other words, the lenders and lessors must be
paid from the project’s cash flows and from the sponsors’ equity in the project, be-
cause the creditors have no claims against the sponsors’ other assets or cash flows.
Often the sponsors write “comfort” letters, giving general assurances that they will
strive diligently to make the project successful. However, these letters are not
legally binding, so in project financing the lenders and lessors must focus their
analysis on the inherent merits of the project and on the equity cushion provided
by the sponsors.17
Project financing is not a new development. Indeed, back in 1299 the English
Crown negotiated a loan with Florentine merchant banks that was to be repaid with
1 year’s output from the Devon silver mines. Essentially, the Italians were allowed to
operate the mines for 1 year, paying all the operating costs and mining as much ore
as they could. The Crown made no guarantees as to how much ore could be mined
or the value of the refined silver. A more current example involved GE Capital, the
credit arm of General Electric, which recently financed a $72 million project to build
an aluminum can plant. The plant is owned by several beverage makers but it is
operated independently, and GE Capital must depend on the cash flows from the
plant to repay the loan. About half of all project financings in recent years have
been for electric generating plants, including plants owned by electric utilities and
cogeneration plants operated by industrial companies. Project financings are gener-
ally characterized by large size and a high degree of complexity. However, because
project financing is tied to a specific project, it can be tailored to meet the specific
needs of both the creditors and the sponsors. In particular, the financing can be
structured so that both the funds provided during the construction phase and
the subsequent repayments match the timing of the project’s projected cash outflows
and inflows.
Project financing offers several potential benefits over conventional debt financ-
ing. For one, project financing usually restricts the use of the project’s cash flows,
which means that the lenders—rather than the managers—can decide whether excess
cash flows should be reinvested or instead used to reduce the loan balance by more
than the minimum required. Conferring this power on the lenders reduces their
risks. Project financings also have advantages for borrowers. First, because risks to
the lenders are reduced, the interest rate built into a project financing deal may be
relatively low. Second, because suppliers of project financing capital have no recourse
against the sponsoring firms’ other assets and cash flows, project financings insulate
the firms’ other assets from risks associated with the project being financed. Man-
agers may be more willing to take on a large, risky project if they know that the com-
pany’s existence would not be threatened if it fails.
17In another type of project financing, each sponsor guarantees its share of the project’s debt obligations.
Here the creditors also consider the creditworthiness of the sponsors in addition to the project’s own pro-
spects. It should be noted that project financing with multiple sponsors in the electric utility industry has
led to problems when one or more of the sponsors has landed in financial trouble. For example, Long Is-
land Lighting, one of the sponsors in the Nine Mile Point nuclear project, became unable to meet its
commitments to the project, which forced other sponsors to shoulder an additional burden or else see
the project cancelled and lose all their investment up to that point. The risk of such default makes many
companies reluctant to enter into similar projects.
816
Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

Project financings increase the number and type of investment opportunities;
hence they make capital markets “more complete.” At the same time, project finan-
cings reduce the costs to investors of obtaining information and monitoring the bor-
rower’s operations. To illustrate, consider an oil and gas exploration project that is
funded using project financing. If the project were financed as an integral part of
the firm’s normal operations, investors in all the firm’s outstanding securities would
need information on the project. By isolating the project, the need for information is
confined to the investors in the project financing, who need to monitor only the pro-
ject’s operations and not those of the entire firm.
Project financings also permit firms whose earnings are below the minimum re-
quirements specified in their existing bond indentures to obtain additional debt fi-
nancing. In such situations, lenders look only at the merits of the new project, and
its cash flows may support additional debt even though the firm’s overall situation
does not. Project financings also permit managers to reveal proprietary information
to a smaller group of investors, so project financings increase the ability of a firm to
maintain confidentiality. Finally, project financings can improve incentives for key
managers by enabling them to take direct ownership stakes in the operations under
their control. By establishing separate projects, companies can provide incentives that
are much more directly based on individual performance than is typically possible
within a large corporation.

Summary
•
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates securities markets.
•
Private placements are securities offerings to a limited number of investors and
are exempt from registration with the SEC.
•
Accredited investors include the officers and directors of a company, high-
wealth individuals, and institutional investors. These investors are eligible to buy
securities in private placements.
•
An angel is a wealthy individual who makes an equity investment in a start-up
company.
•
The managers of a venture capital fund are called venture capitalists, or VCs.
They raise money from investors and make equity investments in start-up com-
panies, called portfolio companies.
•
Going public in an initial public offering (IPO) facilitates stockholder diversi-
fication, increases liquidity of the firm’s stock, makes it easier for the firm to
raise capital, establishes a value for the firm, and makes it easier for a firm to sell
its products. However, reporting costs are high, operating data must be dis-
closed, management self-dealings are harder to arrange, the price may sink to a
low level if the stock is not traded actively, and public ownership may make it
harder for management to maintain control.
•
Investment banks assist in issuing securities by helping the firm determine the size
of the issue and the type of securities to be used, by establishing the selling price, by
selling the issue, and, in some cases, by maintaining an after-market for the stock.
•
An investment bank may sell a security issue on a best efforts basis, or it may
guarantee the sale by underwriting the issue.
•
Before an IPO, the investment bank and management team go on a roadshow
and make presentations to potential institutional investors.

•
An IPO is oversubscribed if investors are willing to purchase more shares than
are being offered at the IPO price.
•
The spread is the difference between the price at which an underwriter sells a
security and the proceeds that the underwriter gives to the issuing company. In
recent years the spread for almost all IPOs has been 7%.
•
An equity carve-out (also called a partial public offering or spin-out) is a
special IPO in which a publicly traded company converts a subsidiary into a
separately traded public company by selling shares of stock in the subsidiary. The
parent typically retains a controlling interest.
•
SEC Rule 415, also known as shelf registration, allows a company to register an
issue and then sell that issue in pieces over time rather than all at once.
•
A seasoned equity offering occurs when a public company issues additional
shares of stock.
•
A private equity fund is a limited liability partnership created to own and
manage investments in the nontraded equity of firms.
•
A company goes private when a small group of investors, including the firm’s
senior management, purchases all of the equity in the company. Such deals
usually involve high levels of debt and are commonly called leveraged buyouts
(LBOs).
•
If a bond has a call provision, then the issuer may refund (call) the bond prior to
maturity and pay for it with a new debt issue at a lower interest rate.
•
In project financing, the payments on debt are secured by the cash flows of a
particular project.
•
Asset securitization occurs when assets such as mortgages or credit card
receivables are bundled together into a pool. Then bonds are created that use the
payments in the pool to make interest and principal payments on the bonds.

New Stock Issue
The Edelman Gem Company, a small jewelry manufacturer, has been successful and
has enjoyed a good growth trend. Now Edelman is planning to go public with an
issue of common stock, and it faces the problem of setting an appropriate price for
the stock. The company and its investment banks believe that the proper procedure
is to select several similar firms with publicly traded common stock and to make rel-
evant comparisons.
Several jewelry manufacturers are reasonably similar to Edelman with respect to
product mix, asset composition, and debt/equity proportions. Of these companies,
Kennedy Jewelers and Strasburg Fashions are most similar. When analyzing the fol-
lowing data, assume that 2005 and 2010 were reasonably “normal” years for all three
companies—that is, these years were neither especially good nor especially bad in
terms of sales, earnings, and dividends. At the time of the analysis, rRF was 8% and
RPM was 4%. Kennedy is listed on the AMEX and Strasburg on the NYSE, while
Edelman will be traded in the Nasdaq market.

*The data are on a per share basis for Kennedy and Strasburg but are totals for Edelman.
a. Assume that Edelman has 100 shares of stock outstanding. Use this information
to calculate earnings per share (EPS), dividends per share (DPS), and book value
per share for Edelman. (Hint: Edelman’s 2010 EPS = $12,000.)
b. Calculate earnings and dividend growth rates for the three companies.
(Hint: Edelman’s EPS growth rate is 8%.)
c. On the basis of your answer to part a, do you think Edelman’s stock would sell at
a price in the same “ballpark” as that of Kennedy and Strasburg—that is, in the
range of $25 to $100 per share?
d. Assuming Edelman’s management can split the stock so that the 100 shares could
be changed to 1,000 shares, 100,000 shares, or any other number, would such an
action make sense in this case? Why or why not?
820
Part 8: Tactical Financing Decisions

e. Now assume that Edelman did split its stock and has 400,000 shares. Calculate
new values for EPS, DPS, and book value per share. (Hint: Edelman’s new 2010
EPS is $3.00.)
f.
Return on equity (ROE) can be measured either as EPS divided by book value
per share or as total earnings divided by total equity. Calculate ROEs for the
three companies for 2010. (Hint: Edelman’s 2010 ROE is 13.3%.)
g. Calculate dividend payout ratios for the three companies for both years.
(Hint: Edelman’s 2010 payout ratio is 50%.)
h. Calculate debt/total assets ratios for the three companies for 2010.
(Hint: Edelman’s 2010 debt ratio is 55%.)
i.
Calculate the P/E ratios for Kennedy and Strasburg for 2010. Are these ratios
reasonable in view of relative growth, payout, and ROE data? If not, then what
other factors might explain them? (Hint: Kennedy’s P/E = 8)
j.
Now determine a range of values for Edelman’s stock price, with 400,000 shares
outstanding, by applying Kennedy’s and Strasburg’s P/E ratios, price/dividends
ratios, and price/book value ratios to your data for Edelman. For example, one
possible price for Edelman’s stock is (P/E Kennedy)(EPS Edelman) = 8($3) = $24
per share. Similar calculations would produce a range of prices based on both
Kennedy’s and Strasburg’s data. (Hint: Our range was $24 to $27.)
k. Using the equation rs = D1/P0 + g, find approximate rs values for Kennedy and
Strasburg. Then use these values in the constant growth stock price model to
find a price for Edelman’s stock. (Hint: We averaged the EPS and DPS g-values
for Edelman.)
l.
At what price do you think Edelman’s shares should be offered to the public?
You will want to select a price that will be low enough to induce investors to buy
the stock but not so low that it will rise sharply immediately after it is issued.
Think about relative growth rates, ROEs, dividend yields, and total returns
(rs = D1/P0 + g).

Refunding Analysis
Jan Volk, financial manager of Green Sea Transport (GST), has been asked by her
boss to review GST’s outstanding debt issues for possible bond refunding. Five years
ago, GST issued $40,000,000 of 11%, 25-year debt. The issue, with semiannual cou-
pons, is currently callable at a premium of 11%, or $110 for each $1,000 par value
bond. Flotation costs on this issue were 6%, or $2,400,000.
Volk believes that GST could issue 20-year debt today with a coupon rate of 8%.
The firm has placed many issues in the capital markets during the last 10 years, and
its debt flotation costs are currently estimated to be 4% of the issue’s value. GST’s
federal-plus-state tax rate is 40%.
Help Volk conduct the refunding analysis by answering the following questions.
a. What is the total dollar call premium required to call the old issue? Is it tax de-
ductible? What is the net after-tax cost of the call?
b. What is the dollar flotation cost on the new issue? Is it immediately tax deduct-
ible? What is the after-tax flotation cost?
c. What amounts of old-issue flotation costs have not been expensed? Can these
deferred costs be expensed immediately if the old issue is refunded? What is the
value of the tax savings?
d. What is the net after-tax cash outlay required to refund the old issue?

e. What is the semiannual tax savings that arises from amortizing the flotation costs
on the new issue? What is the forgone semiannual tax savings on the old-issue
flotation costs?
f.
What is the semiannual after-tax interest savings that would result from the
refunding?
g. Thus far, Volk has identified two future cash flows: (1) the net of new-issue flo-
tation cost tax savings and old-issue flotation cost tax savings that are lost if re-
funding occurs and (2) after-tax interest savings. What is the sum of these two
semiannual cash flows? What is the appropriate discount rate to apply to these
future cash flows? What is their present value?
h. What is the NPV of refunding? Should GST refund now or wait until later?

Refunding Analysis
Mullet Technologies is considering whether or not to refund a $75 million, 12% cou-
pon, 30-year bond issue that was sold 5 years ago. It is amortizing $5 million of flotation
costs on the 12% bonds over the issue’s 30-year life. Mullet’s investment banks have in-
dicated that the company could sell a new 25-year issue at an interest rate of 10% in to-
day’s market. Neither they nor Mullet’s management anticipate that interest rates will
fall below 10% any time soon, but there is a chance that rates will increase.
A call premium of 12% would be required to retire the old bonds, and flotation
costs on the new issue would amount to $5 million. Mullet’s marginal federal-
plus-state tax rate is 40%. The new bonds would be issued 1 month before the old
bonds are called, with the proceeds being invested in short-term government securi-
ties returning 6% annually during the interim period.

O
n January 28, 2005, Procter & Gamble (P&G) bid almost $55 billion to
acquire Gillette in a friendly merger. When the deal was completed on
October 1, 2005, it created the world’s largest consumer goods
company, making the merger the biggest of the year.
Combining Gillette and P&G has already produced several winners.
When the deal was announced, Gillette’s shareholders saw the value of
their stock rise by more than 17%. One particular winner was Gillette’s
largest shareholder, Warren Buffett, who owned roughly 96 million shares.
Other winners included Gillette’s senior executives, who saw the value of
their stock and stock options increase, and the investment banks that
helped put the deal together. Estimates suggest that Goldman Sachs,
Merrill Lynch, and UBS each received $30 million from the transaction.
Although many applauded the deal, others believe that P&G will have to
work hard to justify the price it paid for Gillette. Moreover, as we point out
in this chapter, the track record for acquiring firms in large deals has not
always been good. As we write this in July 2009, P&G’s stock is up only
3% since the completion of the merger. However, the S&P 500 is down by
20%. We can’t say what P&G’s performance would have been without the
merger, but it has certainly outperformed the overall stock market. Keep
the P&G–Gillette merger in mind as you read this chapter.

Most corporate growth occurs by internal expansion, which takes place when a firm’s
existing divisions grow through normal capital budgeting activities. However, the
most dramatic examples of growth result from mergers, the first topic covered in this
chapter. Leveraged buyouts, or LBOs, occur when a firm’s stock is acquired by a small
group of investors rather than by another operating company. Conditions change
over time, causing firms to sell off, or divest, major divisions to other firms that can
better utilize the divested assets. Divestitures are also discussed in the chapter. Finally,
we discuss the holding company form of organization, wherein one corporation owns the
stock of one or more other companies.
21.1 RATIONALE FOR MERGERS
Many reasons have been proposed by financial managers and theorists to account
for the high level of U.S. merger activity. The primary motives behind corporate
mergers are presented in this section.1
Synergy
The primary motivation for most mergers is to increase the value of the combined
enterprise. If Companies A and B merge to form Company C and if C’s value
exceeds that of A and B taken together, then synergy is said to exist, and such a
merger should be beneficial to both A’s and B’s stockholders.2 Synergistic effects
can arise from five sources: (1) operating economies, which result from economies of
scale in management, marketing, production, or distribution; (2) financial economies,
including lower transaction costs and better coverage by security analysts; (3) tax
effects, in which case the combined enterprise pays less in taxes than the separate firms
would pay; (4) differential efficiency, which implies that the management of one firm is
more efficient and that the weaker firm’s assets will be more productive after the
merger; and (5) increased market power due to reduced competition. Operating and
financial economies are socially desirable, as are mergers that increase managerial
efficiency, but mergers that reduce competition are socially undesirable and illegal.3
Expected synergies are not always realized. For example, when AOL acquired
Time Warner, it believed that Time Warner’s extensive content library could be
sold to AOL’s Internet subscribers and that AOL subscribers could be shifted over
to Time Warner’s cable system. When the merger was announced, the new manage-
ment estimated that such synergies would increase operating income by $1 billion
per year. However, things didn’t work out as expected, and in 2002 Time Warner
had to write off about $100 billion in lost value associated with the merger.

1As we use the term, merger means any combination that forms one economic unit from two or more
previous ones. For legal purposes, there are distinctions among the various ways these combinations can
occur, but our focus is on the fundamental economic and financial aspects of mergers.
2If synergy exists, then the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Synergy is also called the “2 plus 2
equals 5 effect.” The distribution of the synergistic gain between A’s and B’s stockholders is determined
by negotiation. This point is discussed later in the chapter.
3In the 1880s and 1890s, many mergers occurred in the United States, and some of them were obviously
directed toward gaining market power rather than increasing efficiency. As a result, Congress passed a
series of acts designed to ensure that mergers are not used to reduce competition. The principal acts
include the Sherman Act (1890), the Clayton Act (1914), and the Celler Act (1950). These acts make it
illegal for firms to combine if the combination tends to lessen competition. The acts are enforced by the
antitrust division of the Justice Department and by the Federal Trade Commission.

creating one of the world’s largest (if not the largest) financial conglomerate. But
BoA tried to back out of the deal as it learned more about ML’s situation. Under
pressure from the government, BoA went through with the merger and almost
immediately reported over $21 billion in associated losses.
As these examples illustrate, often it is blemishes and not synergies that materialize
after a merger.
Tax Considerations
Tax considerations have stimulated a number of mergers. For example, a profitable
firm in the highest tax bracket could acquire a firm with large accumulated tax losses.
These losses could then be turned into immediate tax savings rather than carried
forward and used in the future.4
Also, mergers can serve as a way of minimizing taxes when disposing of excess
cash. For example, if a firm has a shortage of internal investment opportunities com-
pared with its free cash flow, it could (1) pay an extra dividend, (2) invest in market-
able securities, (3) repurchase its own stock, or (4) purchase another firm. If it pays an
extra dividend, its stockholders would have to pay immediate taxes on the distribu-
tion. Marketable securities often provide a good temporary parking place for money,
but they generally earn a rate of return less than that required by stockholders. A
stock repurchase might result in a capital gain for the selling stockholders. However,
using surplus cash to acquire another firm would avoid all these problems, and this
has motivated a number of mergers. Still, as we discuss later, the tax savings are often
less than the premium paid in the acquisition. Thus, mergers motivated only by tax
considerations often reduce the acquiring shareholders’ wealth.
Purchase of Assets Below Their Replacement Cost
Sometimes a firm will be touted as an acquisition candidate because the cost of repla-
cing its assets is considerably higher than its market value. This is especially true in
the natural resources industry; for example, an oil company’s reserves might be worth
more on paper than the company’s stock. (Of course, converting paper value to mon-
etary value isn’t always as easy as it sounds.)
Diversification
Managers often cite diversification as a reason for mergers. They contend that diversifica-
tion helps stabilize a firm’s earnings and thus benefits its owners. Stabilization of earnings
is certainly beneficial to employees, suppliers, and customers, but its value to stockholders
is less certain. Why should Firm A acquire Firm B to stabilize earnings when stockholders
can simply buy the stocks of both firms? Indeed, research suggests that in most cases
diversification does not increase the firm’s value. In fact, many studies find that diversified
firms are worth significantly less than the sum of their individual parts.5
Of course, if you were the owner-manager of a closely held firm, it might be
nearly impossible to sell part of your stock to diversify. Also, selling your stock would
probably lead to a large capital gains tax. So, a diversification merger might be the
best way to achieve personal diversification for a privately held firm.
4Mergers undertaken only to use accumulated tax losses would probably be challenged by the IRS. In
recent years, Congress has made it increasingly difficult for firms to pass along tax savings after mergers.

cial Economics, 1995, pp. 37–65; and Larry Lang and René Stulz, “Tobin’s Q, Corporate Diversification,
and Firm Performance,” Journal of Political Economy, December 1994, pp. 1248–1280.

Managers’ Personal Incentives
Financial economists like to think that business decisions are based only on economic
considerations, especially maximization of firms’ values. However, many business
decisions are based more on managers’ personal motivations than on economic analyses.
Business leaders like power, and more power is attached to running a larger corporation
than a smaller one. Most likely, no executive would admit that his or her ego was the
primary reason behind a merger, but egos do play a prominent role in many mergers.6
It has also been observed that executive salaries are highly correlated with com-
pany size—the bigger the company, the higher the salaries of its top officers. This,
too, could obviously cause unnecessary acquisitions.
Personal considerations deter as well as motivate mergers. After most takeovers, some
managers of the acquired companies lose their jobs, or at least their autonomy. Therefore,
managers who own less than 51% of their firms’ stock look to devices that will lessen the
chances of a takeover, and a merger can serve as such a device. In 2005, for example, MCI’s
board of directors, over the objection of large shareholders, turned down repeated acquisi-
tion offers from Qwest, at the time the nation’s fourth-largest local phone company, in
favor of substantially smaller offers from Verizon, the nation’s largest phone company.
MCI’s management viewed Verizon as a stronger, more stable partner than Qwest even
though Qwest’s bid was at times 20% higher than Verizon’s. In response to management’s
refusal to accept the higher bid, the holders of some 28% of MCI’s stock withheld their
votes to re-elect the board of directors as a protest. Nonetheless, management proceeded
with the Verizon merger negotiations, and the two companies merged in June of 2006. In
such cases, management always argues that synergy, not a desire to protect their own jobs,
is the motivation for the choice. However, it is difficult to rationalize rejecting a 20% larger
bid for undocumented synergies, and some observers suspect that this merger—like many
others—was ultimately designed to benefit managers rather than shareholders.
Breakup Value
Some takeover specialists estimate a company’s breakup value, which is the value of
the individual parts of the firm if they were sold off separately. If this value is higher
than the firm’s current market value, then a takeover specialist could acquire the firm
at or even above its current market value, sell it off in pieces, and earn a profit.

21.2 TYPES OF MERGERS
Economists classify mergers into four types: (1) horizontal, (2) vertical, (3) congeneric,
and (4) conglomerate. A horizontal merger occurs when one firm combines with
another in its same line of business—the 2005 Sprint–Nextel merger is an example. An
example of a vertical merger would be a steel producer’s acquisition of one of its own
suppliers, such as an iron or coal mining firm, or an oil producer’s acquisition of a
petrochemical firm that uses oil as a raw material. Congeneric means “allied in nature or

action”; hence a congeneric merger involves related enterprises but not producers of the
same product (horizontal) or firms in a producer–supplier relationship (vertical). The
AOL and Time Warner merger is an example. A conglomerate merger occurs when
unrelated enterprises combine.
Operating economies (and also anticompetitive effects) are at least partially dependent
on the type of merger involved. Vertical and horizontal mergers generally provide the
greatest synergistic operating benefits, but they are also the ones most likely to be
attacked by the Department of Justice as being anticompetitive.7 In any event, it is useful
to think of these economic classifications when analyzing prospective mergers.

21.3 LEVEL OF MERGER ACTIVITY
Five principal “merger waves” have occurred in the United States. The first was in the
late 1800s, when consolidations occurred in the oil, steel, tobacco, and other basic indus-
tries. The second was in the 1920s, when the stock market boom helped financial promo-
ters consolidate firms in a number of industries, including utilities, communications, and
autos. The third was in the 1960s, when conglomerate mergers were the rage. The fourth
occurred in the 1980s, when LBO firms and others began using junk bonds to finance all
manner of acquisitions. The fifth, which involves strategic alliances designed to enable
firms to compete better in the global economy, is in progress today.
As can be seen from Table 21-1, some huge mergers have occurred in recent
years. Most recent mergers have been strategic in nature—companies are merging
to gain economies of scale or scope and thus be better able to compete in the world
economy. Indeed, many recent mergers have involved companies in the financial,
defense, media, computer, telecommunications, and health care industries, all of
which are experiencing structural changes and intense competition.

In the 1980s, cash was the preferred method of payment, because large cash payments
could convince even the most reluctant shareholder to approve the deal. However, the
cash was generally obtained by borrowing, leaving the consolidated company with a
heavy debt burden, which often led to difficulties. In recent years, stock has replaced
borrowed cash as the merger currency for two reasons: (1) Many of the 1980s mergers
were financed with junk bonds that later went into default. These defaults, along with the
demise of Drexel Burnham, the leading junk bond dealer, have made it difficult to
arrange debt-financed mergers. (2) Most recent mergers have been for strategic reasons,
such as Eli Lilly’s $6.5 billion acquisition of ImClone Systems in 2008. Most of these
mergers have been friendly, and stock swaps are easier to arrange in friendly mergers
than in hostile ones.
There has also been an increase in cross-border mergers. For example, in 2009
Wal-Mart acquired Distribucion y Servicio, a large chain of supermarkets in Chile.

What are some reasons for the current wave?
21.4 HOSTILE VERSUS FRIENDLY TAKEOVERS
In the vast majority of merger situations, one firm (generally the larger of the two)
simply decides to buy another company, negotiates a price with the management of
the target firm, and then acquires the target company. Occasionally, the acquired
firm will initiate the action, but it is much more common for a firm to seek compa-
nies to acquire than to seek to be acquired. Following convention, we call a company
that seeks to acquire another firm the acquiring company and the one that it seeks
to acquire the target company.
Once an acquiring company has identified a possible target, it must (1) establish a
suitable price, or range of prices, and (2) decide on the terms of payment—will it
offer cash, its own common stock, bonds, or some combination? Next, the acquiring
firm’s managers must decide how to approach the target company’s managers. If the
acquiring firm has reason to believe that the target’s management will approve the
merger, then one CEO will contact the other, propose a merger, and then try to
work out suitable terms. If an agreement is reached, then the two management
groups will issue statements to their stockholders indicating that they approve the
merger, and the target firm’s management will recommend to its stockholders that
they agree to the merger. Generally, the stockholders are asked to tender (or send
in) their shares to a designated financial institution, along with a signed power of
attorney that transfers ownership of the shares to the acquiring firm. The target
firm’s stockholders then receive the specified payment, either common stock of the
acquiring company (in which case the target company’s stockholders become stock-
holders of the acquiring company), cash, bonds, or some mix of cash and securities.
This is a friendly merger. The P&G–Gillette merger is an example.
Often, however, the target company’s management resists the merger. Perhaps
they feel that the price offered is too low, or perhaps they simply want to keep their
jobs. Regardless of the reasons, in this case the acquiring firm’s offer is said to be
hostile rather than friendly, and the acquiring firm must make a direct appeal to
the target firm’s stockholders. In a hostile merger, the acquiring company will again
make a tender offer, and again it will ask the stockholders of the target firm to
tender their shares in exchange for the offered price. This time, though, the target
firm’s managers will urge stockholders not to tender their shares, generally stating
that the price offered (cash, bonds, or stocks in the acquiring firm) is too low.
832
Part 9: Special Topics

Although most mergers are friendly, there are cases in which high-profile firms
have attempted hostile takeovers. For example, Wachovia defeated a hostile bid by
SunTrust and was acquired, instead, by First Union. Looking overseas, Olivetti
successfully conducted a hostile takeover of Telecom Italia, and, in another hostile
telecommunications merger, Britain’s Vodafone AirTouch acquired its German rival,
Mannesmann AG.
Perhaps not surprisingly, hostile bids often fail. However, an all-cash offer that is
high enough will generally overcome any resistance by the target firm’s management.
A hostile merger often begins with a “preemptive” or “blowout” bid. The idea is to
offer such a high premium over the pre-announcement price that (a) no other bid-
ders will be willing to jump into the fray and (b) the target company’s board cannot
simply reject the bid. If a hostile bid is eventually accepted by the target’s board then
the deal ends up as “friendly,” despite any acrimony during the hostile phase.
Self-Test
What is the difference between a hostile and a friendly merger?
21.5 MERGER REGULATION
Prior to the mid-1960s, friendly acquisitions generally took place as simple exchange-
of-stock mergers, and a proxy fight was the primary weapon used in hostile control
battles. In the mid-1960s, however, corporate raiders began to operate differently.
First, it took a long time to mount a proxy fight—raiders had to first request a list
of the target company’s stockholders, be refused, and then get a court order forcing
management to turn over the list. During that time, the target’s management could
think through and then implement a strategy to fend off the raider. As a result,
management won most proxy fights.
Then raiders thought, “If we could bring the decision to a head quickly, before
management can take countermeasures, that would greatly increase our probability of
success.” That led the raiders to turn from proxy fights to tender offers, which had a
much shorter response time. For example, the stockholders of a company whose
stock was selling for $20 might be offered $27 per share and be given 2 weeks to
accept. The raider, meanwhile, would have accumulated a substantial block of the
shares in open market purchases, and additional shares might have been purchased
by institutional friends of the raider who promised to tender their shares in exchange
for the tip that a raid was to occur.
Faced with a well-planned raid, managements were generally overwhelmed. The
stock might actually be worth more than the offered price, but management simply
did not have time to get this message across to stockholders or to find a competing
bidder. This situation seemed unfair, so Congress passed the Williams Act in 1968.
This law had two main objectives: (1) to regulate the way acquiring firms can structure
takeover offers and (2) to force acquiring firms to disclose more information about
their offers. In essence, Congress wanted to put target managements in a better
position to defend against hostile offers. Additionally, Congress believed that share-
holders needed easier access to information about tender offers—including information
on any securities that might be offered in lieu of cash—in order to make rational
tender-versus-don’t-tender decisions.
The Williams Act placed the following four restrictions on acquiring firms: (1)
Acquirers must disclose their current holdings and future intentions within 10 days of
amassing at least 5% of a company’s stock. (2) Acquirers must disclose the source of the
funds to be used in the acquisition. (3) The target firm’s shareholders must be allowed
at least 20 days to tender their shares; that is, the offer must be “open” for at least 20
Chapter 21: Mergers, LBOs, Divestitures, and Holding Companies
833

days. (4) If the acquiring firm increases the offer price during the 20-day open period,
then all shareholders who tendered prior to the new offer must receive the higher
price. In total, these restrictions were intended to reduce the acquiring firm’s ability
to surprise management and to stampede target shareholders into accepting an inade-
quate offer. Prior to the Williams Act, offers were generally made on a first-come, first-
served basis, and they were often accompanied by an implicit threat to lower the bid
price after 50% of the shares were in hand. The legislation also gave the target more
time to mount a defense, and it gave rival bidders and white knights a chance to enter
the fray and thus help a target’s stockholders obtain a better price.
Many states have also passed laws designed to protect firms in their states from
hostile takeovers. In 1987 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an Indiana law that radi-
cally changed the rules of the takeover game. Specifically, the Indiana law first de-
fined “control shares” as enough shares to give an investor 20% of the vote. It went
on to state that when an investor buys control shares, those shares can be voted only
after approval by a majority of “disinterested shareholders,” defined as those who are
neither officers nor inside directors of the company nor associates of the raider. The
law also gives the buyer of control shares the right to insist that a shareholders’ meet-
ing be called within 50 days to decide whether the shares may be voted. The Indiana
law dealt a major blow to raiders, mainly because it slows down the action and thus
gives the target firm time to mount a defense. Delaware (the state in which most
large companies are incorporated) later passed a similar bill, as did New York and a
number of other important states.
The new state laws also have some features that protect target stockholders from
their own managers. Included are limits on the use of golden parachutes, onerous
debt financing plans, and some types of takeover defenses. Because these laws do
not regulate tender offers per se but rather govern the practices of firms in the state,
they have withstood all legal challenges to date. But when companies such as IBM
offer 100% premiums for companies such as Lotus, it is hard for any defense to
hold them off.

21.6 OVERVIEW OF MERGER ANALYSIS
An acquiring firm must answer two questions. First, how much would the target be
worth after being incorporated into the acquirer? Notice that this may be quite dif-
ferent from the target’s current value, which does not reflect any post-merger syner-
gies or tax benefits. Second, how much should the acquirer offer for the target? A
low price is obviously better for the acquirer, but the target won’t take the offer if it
is too low. However, a higher offer price could scare off potential rival bidders. Later
sections discuss setting the offer’s price and structure (cash versus stock), but for now
we focus on estimating the post-merger value of the target.
There are two basic approaches used in merger valuation: discounted cash flow
(DCF) techniques and market multiple analysis.8 Survey evidence shows that 49.3%
of firms use only discounted cash flow techniques, 33.3% use both DCF and market
multiples, and 12.0% use only market multiples. The market multiple approach
assumes that a target is directly comparable to the average firm in its industry.
8See Chapter 7 for an explanation of market multiple analysis.
834
Part 9: Special Topics

Therefore, this procedure provides at best a ballpark estimate. Because it is less accu-
rate and less frequently used than DCF approaches, we will focus on DCF methods.9
There are three widely used DCF methods: (1) the corporate valuation method,
(2) the adjusted present value method, and (3) the equity residual method, which is
also called the “free cash flow to equity” method. Chapter 13 explained the corporate
valuation model, Section 21.7 explains the adjusted present value model, and Section
21.8 explains the equity residual model. Section 21.8 also provides a numerical illus-
tration for a company with a constant capital structure and shows that all three mod-
els, when properly applied, produce identical valuations if the capital structure is held
constant. However, in many situations, there will be a nonconstant capital structure
in years immediately following the merger. For example, this often occurs if an
acquisition is financed with a temporarily high level of debt that will be reduced to
a sustainable level as the merger is digested. In such situations, it is extremely difficult
to apply the corporate valuation model or the equity residual model correctly because
the cost of equity and the cost of capital are changing as the capital structure changes.
Fortunately, the adjusted present value model is ideally suited for such situations, as
we show in the next section.
Self-Test
What are the two questions that an acquirer must answer?
What are four methods for estimating a target’s value?
21.7 THE ADJUSTED PRESENT VALUE (APV) APPROACH
Recall from Chapter 15 that interest payments are tax deductible. This means that the
government receives less tax revenue from a levered firm than from an otherwise identi-
cal but unlevered firm, which leaves more money available for the levered firm’s inves-
tors. More money for investors increases a firm’s value, all else equal. In other words, the
value of a levered firm is equal to the value of an unlevered firm plus an adjustment for tax
savings. The adjusted present value (APV) approach explicitly employs this concept
by expressing the value of operations as the sum of two components: (1) the unlevered
value of the firm’s operations (i.e., as though the firm had no debt), plus (2) the present
value of the interest tax savings, also known as the interest tax shield:
VOperations ¼ VUnlevered þ VTax shield
(21-1)
The value of an unlevered firm’s operations is the present value of the firm’s free
cash flows discounted at the unlevered cost of equity, and the value of the tax shield
is the present value of all of the interest tax savings (TS), discounted at the unlevered
cost of equity, rsU:10
9For recent survey evidence on merger valuation methods, see Tarun K. Mukherjee, Halil Kiymaz, and
H. Kent Baker, “Merger Motives and Target Valuation: A Survey of Evidence from CFOs,” Journal of
Applied Finance, Fall/Winter 2004, pp. 7–23. For evidence on the effectiveness of market multiples and
DCF approaches, see S. N. Kaplan and R. S. Ruback, “The Market Pricing of Cash Flow Forecasts:
Discounted Cash Flow vs. the Method of ‘Comparables,’” Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, Winter

tion Practices in Major U.S. Firms,” Financial Practice and Education, Spring 1991, pp. 73–81.
10Although some analysts discount the tax shield at the cost of debt or some other rate, we believe that
the unlevered cost of equity is the appropriate discount rate for the interest tax savings. See Chapter 26
for a detailed explanation.

Before we can apply Equations 21-2 and 21-3, the FCF and TS must eventually
stabilize at a constant growth rate. When they do so, we can use an approach similar
to the ones we used for the nonconstant dividend model in Chapter 7 and the corpo-
rate valuation model in Chapter 13. In those approaches, we explicitly projected the
years with nonconstant growth rates, found the horizon value at the end of the non-
constant growth period, and then calculated the present value of the horizon value
and the cash flows during the forecast period.
Here is a detailed description of how to apply that approach in the APV model.
1. Calculate the target’s unlevered cost of equity, rsU, based upon its current capital
structure at the time of the acquisition. In other words, you “unlever” the target’s
cost of equity. Chapter 26 shows that a firm’s levered cost of equity, rsL, is a
function of its unlevered cost of equity, its cost of debt (rd), and the amount of
debt (D) and equity (S) in its capital structure:
rsL ¼ rsU þ ðrsU −rdÞðD=SÞ
(21-4)
Because the weights of debt and equity in a capital structure, wd and ws, are
defined as D/(D + S) and S/(D + S), respectively, the ratio of D/S can be
expressed as wd/ws. We make this substitution in Equation 21-4 and then solve
for the unlevered cost of equity:
rsU ¼ wsrsL þ wdrd
(21-5)
Keep in mind that rsL, rd, wd, and ws are based upon the target’s capital structure
immediately before the acquisition.
2. Project the free cash flows, FCFt, and the annual interest tax savings, TSt. The
tax savings are equal to the projected interest payments multiplied by the
tax rate:11
Tax savings ¼ ðInterest expenseÞðTax rateÞ
(21-6)
11The tax shield is based only on interest expense, not the net value of interest expense and interest
income. This is because the impact of interest income is taken into account when the value of short-term
investments is added later to the value of operations; hence, including the impact of interest income in the
tax shield would amount to “double counting.” In other words, there are no “side effects” due to owning a
short-term investment: The value of the investment to the company is just the reported value. This is in
contrast to debt, which does have a “side effect” in the sense that the cost to the company is less than
the reported value because of the tax shield provided by the debt.
836
Part 9: Special Topics

You must project enough years so that the FCF and the tax savings are
expected to grow at a constant rate (g) after the horizon, which is at Year N. This
means that the capital structure must become constant at Year N −1 to ensure
that the projected interest payment at Year N will grow at a constant rate after
Year N. See Web Extension 21A for a detailed explanation of how to project
financial statements that reflect a constant capital structure. For the remainder of
this chapter, we will assume that your trusty assistant has made such projections.
Observe that the APV approach does not require a constant capital structure
in each and every year of the analysis; it requires only that the capital structure
eventually become stable in the post-horizon period.
3. Calculate the horizon value of an unlevered firm at Year N (HVU,N), which is the
value of all free cash flows beyond the horizon discounted back to the horizon
at the unlevered cost of equity. Also calculate the horizon value of the tax shield
at Year N (HVTS,N), which is the value of all tax shields beyond the horizon dis-
counted back to the horizon at the unlevered cost of equity. Because FCF and TS
are growing at a constant rate of g in the post-horizon period, we can use the
constant growth formula:
Horizon value of
unlevered firm
¼ HVU;N ¼ FCFNþ1
rsU −g ¼ FCFNð1 þ gÞ
rsU −g
(21-7)
and
Horizon value of
tax shield
¼ HVTS;N ¼ TSNþ1
rsU −g ¼ TSNð1 þ gÞ
rsU −g
(21-8)
The unlevered horizon value is the horizon value of the company if it had no debt.
The tax shield horizon value is the contribution the tax savings after Year N make
to the horizon value of the levered firm. Therefore, the horizon value of the levered
firm is the sum of the unlevered horizon value and the tax shield horizon value.
4. Calculate the present value of the free cash flows and their horizon value. This is the
value of operations for the unlevered firm—that is, the value it would have if it had
no debt. Also calculate the present value of the yearly tax savings during the forecast
period and the horizon value of tax savings. This is the value that the interest tax
shield contributes to the firm. The sum of the value of unlevered operation and the
value of the tax shield is equal to the value of operations for the levered firm:

subtract the value of the debt before the merger from the total value of the firm.

The APV technique is especially useful for valuing acquisition targets. Many
acquisitions are difficult to value using the corporate valuation model because (1)
acquiring firms frequently assume the debt of the target firm, so old debt at different
coupon rates is often part of the deal; and (2) the acquisition is usually financed
partially by new debt that will be paid down rapidly, so the proportion of debt in
the capital structure changes during the years immediately following the acquisition.
Thus, the debt cost and capital structure associated with a merger are generally more
complex than for a typical firm. The easiest way to handle these complexities is to
specify each year’s expected interest expense and use the APV method to find the
value of the unlevered firm and the interest tax shields separately, and then sum those
values.

21.8 THE FREE CASH FLOW TO EQUITY
(FCFE) APPROACH
Free cash flow is the cash flow available for distribution to all investors. In contrast, free
cash flow to equity (FCFE) is the cash flow available for distribution to common share-
holders. Because FCFE is available for distribution only to shareholders, it should be dis-
counted at the cost of equity. Therefore, the free cash flow to equity approach, also
called the equity residual model, discounts the projected FCFEs at the cost of equity
to determine the value of the equity from operations.
Because FCFE is the cash flow available for distribution to shareholders, it
may be used to pay common dividends, repurchase stock, purchase financial
assets, or some combination of these uses. In other words, the uses of FCFE
include all those of FCF except for distributions to debtholders. Therefore, one
way to calculate FCFE is to start with FCF and reduce it by the net after-tax
distributions to debtholders:
FCFE ¼
Free
cash flow −

interest expense −Principal
payments þ Newly issued
debt
¼
Free
cash flow
−Interest
expense þ
Interest
tax shield þ Net change

(21-12)
838
Part 9: Special Topics

Alternatively, the FCFE can be calculated as
FCFE ¼ Net income −Net investment in
operating capital þ Net change
in debt
(21-12a)
Both calculations provide the same value for FCFE, but Equation 21-12 is used
more often because analysts don’t always estimate the net income for a target after
it has been acquired.
Given projections of FCFE, the value of a firm’s equity due to operations,
VFCFE, is
VFCFE ¼

value of equity due to operations, HVFCFE,N, is
HVFCFE;N ¼ FCFENþ1

The total value of a company’s equity, S, is the value of the equity from operations
plus the value of any nonoperating assets:
S ¼ VFCFE þ Nonoperating assets
(21-16)
To get a per share price, simply divide the total value of equity by the shares
outstanding.12 Like the corporate valuation model, the FCFE model can be applied
only when the capital structure is constant.
Table 21-2 summarizes the three cash flow valuation methods and their
assumptions.

What cash flows are discounted in the FCFE model, and what is the
discount rate?
How do the FCFE, corporate valuation, and APV models differ? How are they
similar?
12The FCFE model is similar to the dividend growth model in that cash flows are discounted at the cost
of equity. The cash flows in the FCFE model are those that are generated from operations, while the cash
flows in the dividend growth model (i.e., the dividends) also contain cash flows due to interest earned on
nonoperating assets.

21.9 ILLUSTRATION OF THE THREE VALUATION
APPROACHES FOR A CONSTANT CAPITAL STRUCTURE
To illustrate the three valuation approaches, consider Caldwell Inc., a large technology
company, as it evaluates the potential acquisition of Tutwiler Controls. Tutwiler currently
has a $62.5 million market value of equity and $27 million in debt, for a total market value
of $89.5 million. Thus, Tutwiler’s capital structure consists of $27/($62.5 + $27) = 30.17%
debt. Caldwell intends to finance the acquisition with this same proportion of debt and
plans to maintain this constant capital structure throughout the projection period and
thereafter. Tutwiler is a publicly traded company, and its market-determined pre-merger
beta was 1.2. Given a risk-free rate of 7% and a 5% market risk premium, the Capital
Asset Pricing Model produces a pre-merger required rate of return on equity, rsL, of
rsL ¼ 7% þ 1:2ð5%Þ ¼ 13%
Tutwiler’s cost of debt is 9%. Its WACC is

¼ 10:707%
How much would Tutwiler be worth to Caldwell after the merger? The following
sections illustrate the application of the corporate valuation model, the APV model,
and the FCFE model. All three models produce an identical value of equity, but keep
in mind this is only because the capital structure is constant. If the capital structure

were to change during the projection period before becoming stable, then only the
APV model could be used. Section 21.11 illustrates the APV in the case of a noncon-
stant capital structure.
Projecting Post-Merger Cash Flows
The first order of business is to estimate the post-merger cash flows that Tutwiler
will produce. This is by far the most important task in any merger analysis. In a
pure financial merger, defined as one in which no operating synergies are expected,
the incremental post-merger cash flows are simply the target firm’s expected cash
flows. In an operating merger, in which the two firms’ operations are to be inte-
grated, forecasting future cash flows is obviously more difficult, because potential
synergies must be estimated. People from marketing, production, human resources,
and accounting play leading roles here, with financial managers focusing on financing
the acquisition and doing an analysis designed to determine whether the projected
cash flows are worth the cost. In this chapter, we take the projections as given and
concentrate on how they are analyzed. See Web Extension 21A, available on the text-
book’s Web site, for a discussion that focuses on projecting financial statements in a
merger analysis.
Table 21-3 shows Tutwiler’s post-merger projections for Tutwiler, taking into
account all expected synergies and maintaining a constant capital structure. Both
Caldwell and Tutwiler are in the 40% marginal federal-plus-state tax bracket. The
cost of debt after the acquisition will remain at 9%. The projections assume that
growth in the post-horizon period will be 6%.
Panel A of Table 21-3 shows selected items from the projected financial statements.
Panel B shows the calculations for free cash flow, which is used in the corporate valua-
tion model. Row 9 shows net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT), which is equal to
EBIT(1 −T). Row 10 shows the net investment in operating capital, which is the annual
change in the total net operating capital in Row 8. Free cash flow, shown in Row 11, is
equal to NOPAT less the net investment in operating capital. Panel C shows the cash
flows that will be used in the APV model. In particular, Row 13 shows the annual tax
shield, which is equal to the interest expense multiplied by the tax rate. Panel D provides
the calculations for FCFE, based upon Equation 21-12.
Of course, the post-merger cash flows are extremely difficult to estimate, and in
merger valuations—just as in capital budgeting analysis—sensitivity, scenario, and
simulation analyses should be conducted.13 Indeed, in a friendly merger the acquiring
firm would send a team consisting of literally dozens of financial analysts, accoun-
tants, engineers, and so forth to the target firm’s headquarters. They would go over
its books, estimate required maintenance expenditures, set values on assets such as
real estate and petroleum reserves, and the like. Such an investigation, which is one
example of due diligence, is an essential part of any merger analysis.
Following are valuations of Tutwiler using all three methods, beginning with the
corporate valuation model.
Valuation Using the Corporate Valuation Model
Because Caldwell does not plan on changing Tutwiler’s capital structure, the post-
merger WACC will be equal to the pre-merger WACC of 10.707% that we

for details.
13We purposely kept the cash flows simple in order to focus on key analytical issues. In actual merger
valuations, the cash flows would be much more complex, normally including such items as tax loss carry-
forwards, tax effects of plant and equipment valuation adjustments, and cash flows from the sale of some
of the subsidiary’s assets.

calculated previously. Tutwiler’s free cash flows are shown in Row 11 of Table 21-3.
The horizon value of Tutwiler’s operations as of 2015 can be calculated with the
constant growth formula that we used in Chapter 13:

in the forecast period and the horizon value:

Notes:
aRounded figures are presented here, but the full nonrounded values are used in all calculations. The tax rate is 40%.
bInterest payments are based on Tutwiler’s existing debt, new debt to be issued to finance the acquisition, and
additional debt required to finance annual growth.
cDebt is existing debt plus additional debt required to maintain a constant capital structure. Caldwell will increase Tut-
wiler’s debt by $6.2 million, from $27 million to $33.2 million, at the time of the acquisition in order to keep the capi-
tal structure constant. This increase occurs because the post-merger synergies make Tutwiler more valuable to Caldwell than
it was on a stand-alone basis. Therefore, it can support more dollars of debt and still maintain the constant debt ratio.
dThe increase in debt at the time of acquisition is a source of free cash flow to equity.

$110:1 −$27 ¼ $83:1 million
Valuation Using the APV Approach
The APV approach requires an estimate of Tutwiler’s unlevered cost of equity. In-
putting Tutwiler’s capital structure, cost of equity, and cost of debt, Equation 21-5
can be used to estimate the unlevered cost of equity:
rsU ¼ wsrsL þ wdrd
(21-5a)
¼ 0:6983ð13%Þ þ 0:3017ð9%Þ
¼ 11:793%
In other words, if Tutwiler had no debt, its cost of equity would be 11.793%.
The horizon value of Tutwiler’s unlevered cash flows (HVU,2015) and tax shield
(HVTS,2015) can be calculated using the constant growth formula with the unlevered
cost of equity as the discount rate, as shown in Equations 21-7 and 21-8:15
HVU;2015 ¼ FCF2016

rsU −g ¼ TS2015ð1 þ gÞ
rsU −g
¼
$1:57ð1:06Þ
0:11793 −0:06 ¼ $28:7 million
The sum of the two horizon values is $124.4 + $28.7 = $153.1 million. This is the
horizon value of operations, which is the same as the horizon value calculation we
reached with the corporate valuation model.
Row 11 in Table 21-3 shows the projected free cash flows. The unlevered value of
operations is calculated as the present value of the free cash flows during the forecast
period and the horizon value of the free cash flows:
VUnlevered ¼

ð1 þ 0:11793Þ4 þ $6:8 þ $124:4
ð1 þ 0:11793Þ5
¼ $88:7 million
14Notice that we subtract the $27 million value of Tutwiler’s debt, not the $33.2 million of debt sup-
ported after the merger, because $27 million is the amount that must be paid off or assumed by
Caldwell.
15Note that we report two decimal places for the 2015 tax shield even though Table 21-3 reports only
one decimal place. All calculations are performed in Excel, which uses the full nonrounded values.
Chapter 21: Mergers, LBOs, Divestitures, and Holding Companies
843

This shows that Tutwiler’s operations would be worth $88.7 million if it had
no debt.
Row 13 shows the yearly interest tax savings. The value of the tax shield is
calculated as the present value of the yearly tax savings and the horizon value of the
tax shield:
VTax shield ¼

ð1 þ 0:11793Þ4 þ $1:57 þ $28:7
ð1 þ 0:11793Þ5
¼ $21:4 million
Thus, Tutwiler’s operations would be worth only $88.7 million if it had no debt,
but its capital structure contributes $21.4 million in value due to the tax deductibility
of its interest payments. Since Tutwiler has no nonoperating assets, the total value of
the firm is the sum of the unlevered value of operations, $88.7 million, and the value
of the tax shield, $21.4 million, for a total of $110.1 million. The value of the equity
is this total value less Tutwiler’s outstanding debt of $27 million: $110.1 −$27 =
$83.1 million. Note that this is the same value we obtained using the corporate
valuation model.
Valuation Using the FCFE Model
The horizon value of Tutwiler’s free cash flows to equity can be calculated using the
constant growth formula of Equation 21-14:16
HVFCFE;2015 ¼ FCF2015ð1 þ gÞ
rsL−g
¼ $7:06ð1:06Þ
0:13−0:06 ¼ $106:9 million
Notice that this horizon value is different from the APV and corporate valuation ho-
rizon values. That is because the FCFE horizon value is only for equity, whereas the
other two horizon values are for the total value of operations. If the 2015 debt of
$46.2 million shown in Row 7 of Table 21-3 is added to the HVFCFE,2015, the result
is the same $153.1 million horizon value of operations obtained with the corporate
valuation model and APV model.
Row 17 in Table 21-3 shows the yearly projections of FCFE. When discounted at
the 13% cost of equity, the present value of these yearly FCFEs and the horizon
value is the value of equity due to operations, which is $83.1 million:17

Note that rounded inter-
mediate values are

formed in Excel using

17Row 16 in Table 21-3 shows that debt is forecast to increase from its pre-merger $27 million to $33.2
million at the acquisition date. This is because Tutwiler is more valuable after the merger, so it can sup-
port more dollars of debt while still maintaining 30% debt in its capital structure. The increase in debt of
$33.2 −$27 = $6.2 million is a FCFE that is immediately available to Caldwell and so is not discounted.
844
Part 9: Special Topics

If Tutwiler had any nonoperating assets, we would add them to VFCFE to determine
the total value of equity. Since Tutwiler has no nonoperating assets, its total equity
value is equal to the VFCFE of $83.1 million. Notice that this is the same value given
by the corporate valuation model and the APV approach.
All three models agree that the estimated equity value is $83.1 million, which is
more than the $62.5 million current market value of Tutwiler’s equity. This means
that Tutwiler is more valuable as a part of Caldwell than as a stand-alone corporation
being run by its current managers.

changing capital structure?
Describe the steps required to apply the APV approach.
How do the FCFE, APV, and corporate valuation approaches differ from one another?
21.10 SETTING THE BID PRICE
Under the acquisition plan, Caldwell would assume Tutwiler’s debt and would also
take on additional short-term debt as necessary to complete the purchase. The valua-
tion models show that $83.1 million is the most it should pay for Tutwiler’s stock. If
it paid more, then Caldwell’s own value would be diluted. On the other hand, if it
could get Tutwiler for less than $83.1 million, Caldwell’s stockholders would gain
value. Therefore, Caldwell should bid something less than $83.1 million when it
makes an offer for Tutwiler.
Now consider the target company. As stated earlier, Tutwiler’s value of equity as
an independent operating company is $62.5 million. If Tutwiler were acquired at a
price greater than $62.5 million then its stockholders would gain value, whereas
they would lose value at any lower price.
The difference between $62.5 million and $83.1 million, or $20.6 million, repre-
sents synergistic benefits expected from the merger. If there were no synergistic
benefits, the maximum bid would be the current value of the target company. The
greater the synergistic gains, the greater the gap between the target’s current price
and the maximum the acquiring company could pay.
The issue of how to divide the synergistic benefits is critically important. Obvi-
ously, both parties would want to get the best deal possible. In our example, if it
knew the maximum price Caldwell could pay, Tutwiler’s management would argue
for a price close to $83.1 million. Caldwell, on the other hand, would try to get
Tutwiler at a price as close to $62.5 million as possible.
Where, within the range of $62.5 to $83.1 million, will the actual price be set?
The answer depends on a number of factors, including whether Caldwell offers to
pay with cash or securities, the negotiating skills of the two management teams,
and, most importantly, the bargaining positions of the two parties as determined by
fundamental economic conditions. Let’s first consider bargaining power and then
examine the mechanics of a cash offer versus a stock offer.
Relative Bargaining Power
To illustrate the relative bargaining power of the target and the acquirer, assume
there are many companies similar to Tutwiler that Caldwell could acquire but
suppose that no company other than Caldwell could gain synergies by acquiring Tut-
wiler. In this case, Caldwell would probably make a relatively low, take-it-or-leave-it
offer, and Tutwiler would probably take it because some gain is better than none. On
the other hand, if Tutwiler has some unique technology or other asset that many

845

companies want, then once Caldwell announces its offer, others would probably
make competing bids and the final price would probably be close to (or even above)
$83.1 million. A price above $83.1 million presumably would be paid by some other
company with a better synergistic fit or with a management that is more optimistic
about Tutwiler’s cash flow potential.
Caldwell would, of course, want to keep its maximum bid secret, and it would plan
its bidding strategy carefully. If it thought other bidders would emerge or that Tut-
wiler’s management might resist in order to preserve their jobs, it might make a high
preemptive bid in hopes of scaring off competing bids or management resistance. On
the other hand, it might make a lowball bid in hopes of “stealing” the company.18
Cash Offers versus Stock Offers
Most target stockholders prefer to sell their shares for cash rather than to exchange
them for stock in the post-merger company. Following is a brief description of each
payment method.
Cash Offers.
Tutwiler’s pre-merger equity is worth $62.5 million. With 10 million
shares outstanding, Tutwiler’s stock price is $62.5/10 = $6.25. If the synergies are
realized, then Tutwiler’s equity will be worth $83.1 million to Caldwell, so $83.1/10
= $8.31 is the maximum price per share that Caldwell should be willing to pay to
Tutwiler’s stockholders. For example, Caldwell might offer $7.25 cash for each share
of Tutwiler stock.
Stock Offers.
In a stock offer, Tutwiler’s stockholders exchange their Tutwiler shares
for new shares in the post-merger company, which will be named CaldwellTutwiler.
Targets typically prefer cash offers to stock offers, so perhaps Caldwell must offer a
package worth $7.50 per share. With 10 million outstanding Tutwiler shares, the Tut-
wiler shareholders must end up owning $7.50 × 10 million = $75 million worth of stock
in the post-merger company.
Suppose Caldwell has 20 million shares of stock outstanding (nOld) prior to the
merger and the stock price per share is $15. Then the total pre-merger value of
Caldwell’s equity is $15 × 20 million = $300 million. As calculated previously, the
post-merger value of Tutwiler to Caldwell is $83.1 million. Therefore, the total
post-merger value of CaldwellTutwiler will be $300 + $83.1 = $383.1 million.
After the merger, Tutwiler’s former stockholders should own $75/$383.1 = 0.196 =
19.58% of the post-merger CaldwellTutwiler. With 20 million Caldwell shares out-
standing, Caldwell must issue enough new shares, nNew, to the Tutwiler stockholders
(in exchange for the Tutwiler shares) so that Tutwiler’s former stockholders will own
19.6% of the shares of CaldwellTutwiler:

Tutwiler’s former stockholders will exchange 10 million shares of stock in Tutwi-
ler for 4.87 million shares of stock in the combined CaldwellTutwiler. Thus, the
exchange ratio is 4.87/10 = 0.487.
After the merger, there will be 4.87 million new shares for a total of 24.87 million
shares. With a combined intrinsic equity value of $383.1 million, the resulting price per
share will be $383.1/24.87 = $15.40. The total value owned by Tutwiler’s shareholders is
this price multiplied by their shares: $15.40 × 4.87 million = $75 million. Also notice that
the price will increase from $15.00 per share before the merger to $15.40 after the
merger, so the merger will benefit Caldwell’s shareholders if the synergies are realized.

21.11 ANALYSIS WHEN THERE IS A PERMANENT
CHANGE IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE
Tutwiler currently has equity worth $62.5 million and debt of $27 million, giving it a
capital structure financed with about 30% debt: $27.0/($62.5 + $27.0) = 0.302 = 30.2%.
Suppose Caldwell has decided to increase Tutwiler’s debt from 30% to 50% over the
next 5 years and to maintain the capital structure at that level from 2015 on. How would
this affect Tutwiler’s valuation? The free cash flows will not change, but the interest tax
shield, the WACC, and the bid price will all change.19 At a 30% debt level, the interest
rate on Tutwiler’s debt was 9%. However, at a 50% debt level, Tutwiler is more risky,
and its interest rate would rise to 9.5% to reflect this additional risk. Because the capital
structure is changing, we will use only the APV for this analysis.
The Effect on the Tax Shield
It is reasonable to assume that Caldwell will use more debt during the first 5 years of
the acquisition if its long-run target capital structure is 50% debt. With more debt
and a higher interest rate, the interest payments will be higher than those shown in
Table 21-3, thus increasing the tax savings shown in Line 15. The interest payments
and tax savings with more debt and a higher interest rate are projected as follows:
2011

$7.00
$7.50

3.32
In these projections, Tutwiler will reach its target capital structure of 50% debt and
50% equity by the start of 2015.20
The Effect on the Bid Price
The new capital structure would affect the maximum bid price by changing the value
of Tutwiler to Caldwell. Based on the new tax shields, the unlevered and tax shield
horizon values in 2015 are calculated as
19We are assuming for simplicity that Tutwiler has no more expected bankruptcy costs at 50% debt than
at 30% debt. If Tutwiler’s risk of bankruptcy and hence its expected bankruptcy costs are larger at this
higher level of debt, then its projected free cash flows should be reduced by these expected costs. In prac-
tice it is extremely difficult to estimate expected bankruptcy costs. However, these costs can be significant
and should be considered when a high degree of leverage is being used.
20The last year’s projected interest expense must be consistent with the assumed capital structure in order
to use the relation TSN+1 = TSN(1 + g) in calculating the tax shield horizon value.

Thus, Tutwiler is worth almost $23 million more to Caldwell if it is financed with
50% rather than 30% debt because of the added value of the tax shields.
The value of operations under the new 50% debt policy is the sum of the unlev-
ered value of operations and the value of the tax shields, or $133.0 million. There are
no nonoperating assets to add, and subtracting the debt of $27 million leaves the
value of Tutwiler’s equity at $106.0 million. Because Tutwiler has 10 million shares
outstanding, the maximum amount Caldwell should be willing to pay per share, given
a post-merger target capital structure of 50% debt, is $10.60. This is more than
the $8.31 maximum price if the capital structure had 30% debt. The difference,
$2.29 per share, reflects the added value of the interest tax shields under the higher-
debt plan.

21.12 TAXES AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE TAKEOVER BID
In a merger, the acquiring firm can either buy the target’s assets or buy shares of
stock directly from the target’s shareholders. If the offer is for the target’s assets
then the target’s board of directors will make a recommendation to the shareholders,
who will vote either to accept or reject the offer. If they accept the offer, the payment
goes directly to the target corporation, which pays off any debt not assumed by the
acquiring firm, pays any corporate taxes that are due, and then distributes the re-
mainder of the payment to the shareholders, often in the form of a liquidating divi-
dend. In this situation, the target firm is usually dissolved and no longer continues to
exist as a separate legal entity, although its assets and work force may continue to
function as a division or as a wholly owned subsidiary of the acquiring firm. The
acquisition of assets is a common form of takeover for small and medium-sized firms,
especially those that are not publicly traded. A major advantage of this method com-
pared with the acquisition of the target’s stock is that the acquiring firm simply
acquires assets and is not saddled with any hidden liabilities. In contrast, if the acquir-
ing firm buys the target’s stock, then it is responsible for any legal contingencies
against the target, even for those that might have occurred prior to the takeover.
An offer for a target’s stock rather than its assets can be made either directly to
the shareholders, as is typical in a hostile takeover, or indirectly through the board
of directors, which in a friendly deal makes a recommendation to the shareholders
to accept the offer. In a successful offer, the acquiring firm will end up owning a con-
trolling interest or perhaps even all of the target’s stock. Sometimes the target retains
its identity as a separate legal entity and is operated as a subsidiary of the acquiring
firm, and sometimes its corporate status is dissolved and it is operated as one of the
acquiring firm’s divisions.
The payment offered by the acquiring firm can be in the form of cash, stock of
the acquiring firm, debt of the acquiring firm, or some combination. The structure
of the bid affects (1) the capital structure of the post-merger firm, (2) the tax treat-
ment of both the acquiring firm and the target’s stockholders, (3) the ability of the
target firm’s stockholders to benefit from future merger-related gains, and (4) the
types of federal and state regulations to which the acquiring firm will be subjected.
The tax consequences of the merger depend on whether it is classified as a taxable
offer or a nontaxable offer.21 In general, a nontaxable offer is one in which the form of
payment is predominately stock, although the application of this simple principle is
much more complicated in practice. The Internal Revenue Code views a mostly stock
merger as an exchange rather than a sale, making it a nontaxable event. However, if
the offer includes a significant amount of cash or bonds, then the IRS views it as a
sale, and it is a taxable transaction just like any other sale.
In a nontaxable deal, target shareholders who receive shares of the acquiring com-
pany’s stock do not have to pay any taxes at the time of the merger. When they even-
tually sell their stock in the acquiring company, they must pay a tax on the gain. The
amount of the gain is the sales price of their stock in the acquiring company minus
the price at which they purchased their original stock in the target company.22 In a

and Corporate Governance, 4th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 2004), especially Chapter 4.
Also see Kenneth E. Anderson, Thomas R. Pope, and John L. Kramer, eds., Prentice Hall’s Federal Taxa-
tion: Corporations, Partnerships, Estates, and Trusts, 2006 ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 2006),

taxable offer, the gain between the offer price and the original purchase price of the
target stock is taxed in the year of the merger.23
All other things equal, stockholders prefer nontaxable offers, since they may then
postpone taxes on their gains. Furthermore, if the target firm’s stockholders receive
stock, they will benefit from any synergistic gains produced by the merger. Most tar-
get shareholders are thus willing to give up their stock for a lower price in a nontax-
able offer than in a taxable one. As a result, one might expect nontaxable bids to
dominate. However, this is not the case: roughly half of all mergers have been tax-
able. The reason for this is explained in the following paragraphs.
The form of the payment also has tax consequences for the acquiring and target
firms. To illustrate, consider the following situation. The target firm has assets
with a book value of $100 million, but these assets have an appraised value of $150
million. The offer by the acquiring firm is worth $225 million. If it is a nontaxable
offer, then after the merger the acquiring firm simply adds the $100 million book
value of the target’s assets to its own assets and continues to depreciate them accord-
ing to their previous depreciation schedules. To keep the example simple, we assume
the target has no debt.
The situation is more complicated for a taxable offer, and the treatment is differ-
ent depending on whether the offer is for the target’s assets or for its stock. If the
acquiring firm offers $225 million for the target’s assets, then the target firm must
pay a tax on the gain of $225 −$100 = $125 million. Assuming a corporate tax rate
Tempest in a Teapot?
In 2001, amid a flurry of warnings and lobbying, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in its
Statement 141 eliminated the use of pooling for merger
accounting, requiring that purchase accounting be used
instead. Because the change would otherwise have
required that all purchased goodwill be amortized and
reported earnings be reduced, the FASB also issued
Statement 142, which eliminated the regular amortiza-
tion of purchased goodwill, replacing it with an “im-
pairment
test.”
The impairment
test requires
that
companies evaluate annually their purchased goodwill
and write it down if its value has declined. This im-
pairment test resulted in Time Warner’s unprecedented
2002 write-down of $54 billion of goodwill associated
with the AOL merger.
So what exactly is the effect of the change? First and
foremost, the change does nothing to the firm’s actual
cash flows. Purchased goodwill may still be amortized
for federal income tax purposes, so the change does
not affect the actual taxes a company pays, nor does
it affect the company’s operating cash flows. However,
it does affect the earnings that companies report to
their shareholders. Firms that used to have large good-
will charges from past acquisitions have seen their re-
ported earnings increase because they no longer have
to amortize the remaining goodwill. Firms whose
acquisitions have fared badly, such as Time Warner,
must make large write-downs. Executives facing an
earnings boost hope—and executives facing a write-
down fear—that investors will not see through these
accounting changes. However, evidence suggests that
investors realize that a company’s assets have deterio-
rated long before the write-down actually occurs, and
they build this information into the price of the stock.
For example, Time Warner’s announcement of its
$54 billion charge in January 2002 resulted in only a
blip in its stock price at that time, even though the
write-down totaled more than a third of its market
value. The market had recognized the decline in value
months earlier, and by the time of the announcement
Time Warner had already lost more than $100 billion in
market value.
23Even in nontaxable deals, taxes must be paid in the year of the merger by any stockholders who receive
cash.

Part 9: Special Topics

of 40%, this tax is 0.40($125) = $50 million. This leaves the target with $225 −$50 =
$175 million to distribute to its shareholders upon liquidation. Adding insult to
injury, the target’s shareholders must also pay individual taxes on any of their own
gains.24 This is truly a taxable transaction, with taxes assessed at both the corporate
and individual levels!
In contrast to the tax disadvantages for the target and its shareholders, the acquir-
ing firm receives two major tax advantages. First, it records the acquired assets at
their appraised value and depreciates them accordingly. Thus, it will depreciate
$150 million of assets in this taxable transaction versus only $100 million in a nontax-
able transaction. Second, it will create $75 million in a new asset account called
goodwill, which is the difference between the purchase price of $225 million and
the appraised value of $150 million. Tax laws that took effect in 1993 permit compa-
nies to amortize this goodwill over 15 years using the straight-line method and also
to deduct the amortization from taxable income. The net effect is that the full pur-
chase price of $225 million can be written off in a taxable merger versus only the
original book value of $100 million in a nontaxable transaction.
Now suppose the acquiring firm offers $225 million for the target’s stock, rather
than just its assets as in the preceding example, in a taxable offer. After completing
the merger, the acquiring firm must choose between two tax treatments. Under the
first alternative, it will record the assets at their book value of $100 million and con-
tinue depreciating them using their current schedules. This treatment does not create
any goodwill. Under the second alternative, it will record the assets at their appraised
value of $150 million and create $75 million of goodwill. As described earlier for the
asset purchase, this allows the acquiring firm to effectively depreciate the entire pur-
chase price of $225 million for tax purposes. However, there will also be an immedi-
ate tax liability on the $125 million gain, just as when the firm purchased assets.25
Therefore, many companies choose not to mark up the assets. Figure 21-1 illustrates
the tax implications for the various types of transactions.
If you think this is complicated, you are right! At this point, you should know
enough to talk with specialized accountants and lawyers or be ready to delve into
tax accounting texts, but merger taxation is too complex a subject to be covered thor-
oughly in a general finance textbook.
Securities laws also have an effect on the offer’s construction. The SEC has oversight
over the issuance of new securities, including stock or debt issued in connection with a
merger. Therefore, whenever a corporation bids for control of another firm through the
exchange of equity or debt, the entire process must take place under the scrutiny of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The time required for such reviews allows target
managements to implement defensive tactics and other firms to make competing offers;
as a result, nearly all hostile tender offers are for cash rather than securities.

24Our example assumes that the target is a publicly owned firm, which means that it must be a “C corpo-
ration” for tax purposes. However, if it is privately held then it might be an “S corporation,” in which case
only the stockholders would be taxed. This helps smaller firms to use mergers as an exit strategy.
25Technically speaking, it is the target firm that is responsible for this tax on the write-up. Keep in mind,
however, that the acquiring firm previously purchased the stock in the target and so, in reality, must bear
the brunt of the tax.

21.13 FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR MERGERS
Although a detailed discussion of financial reporting is best left to accounting
courses, the accounting implications of mergers cannot be ignored. Currently, mer-
gers are handled using purchase accounting.26 Keep in mind, however, that all
larger companies are required to keep two sets of books. The first is for the IRS,
and it reflects the tax treatment of mergers as described in the previous section.
The second is for financial reporting, and it reflects the treatment described here.
As you will see, the rules for financial reporting differ from those for the IRS.

Note: These are actual cash tax effects. However, the tax effects reported to shareholders will be different
because shareholder statements must conform to GAAP conventions, not to federal Tax Code conventions. For
example, purchased goodwill can no longer be deducted for shareholder reporting under GAAP, even though it is
still deductible for federal tax purposes. See the box entitled “Tempest in a Teapot?”; it deals with changes in the
accounting treatment of mergers and goodwill.

Part 9: Special Topics

Purchase Accounting
Table 21-4 illustrates purchase accounting. Here, Firm A is assumed to have
“bought” Firm B using the stock of the acquiring company. If the price paid is
exactly equal to the acquired firm’s net asset value, which is defined as its total assets
minus its liabilities, then the consolidated balance sheet will be as if the two state-
ments were merged. Normally, though, there is an important difference. If the price
paid exceeds the net asset value, then asset values will be increased to reflect the price
actually paid, whereas if the price paid is less than the net asset value, then assets must
be written down when preparing the consolidated balance sheet.
Note that Firm B’s net asset value is $30, which is also its reported common
equity value. This $30 book value could be equal to the market value (which is deter-
mined by investors based on the firm’s earning power), but book value could also be
more or less than the market value. Three situations are considered in Table 21-4.
First, in Column 3 we assume that Firm A gives stock worth $20 for Firm B. Thus,
B’s assets as reported on its balance sheet were overvalued, and A pays less than B’s
net asset value. The overvaluation could be in either fixed or current assets; an
appraisal would be made, but we assume it is fixed assets that are overvalued. Accord-
ingly, we reduce B’s fixed assets and also its common equity by $10 before construct-
ing the consolidated balance sheet shown in Column 3. Next, in Column 4, we
assume that A pays exactly the net asset value for B. In this case, the financial state-
ments are simply combined.
Finally, in Column 5 we assume that A pays more than the net asset value for
B: $50 is paid for $30 of net assets. This excess is assumed to be partly attributable
to undervalued assets (land, buildings, machinery, and inventories) and so, to reflect
this undervaluation, current and fixed assets are each increased by $5. In addition, we

consolidated balance sheet.
cHere we assume that Firm B’s current and fixed assets are both increased to $30.
dGoodwill refers to the excess paid for a firm above the appraised value of the physical assets pur-
chased. Goodwill represents payment both for intangibles such as patents and for “organization
value,” such as that associated with having an effective sales force. Beginning in 2001, purchased
goodwill such as this could not be amortized for financial statement reporting purposes.
eFirm B’s common equity is reduced by $10 prior to consolidation to reflect the fixed asset write-off.
fFirm B’s equity is increased to $50 to reflect the above-book purchase price.
Chapter 21: Mergers, LBOs, Divestitures, and Holding Companies
853

assume that $10 of the $20 excess of market value over book value is due to a super-
ior sales organization or to some other intangible factor, and we post this excess as
goodwill. Firm B’s common equity is increased by $20, the sum of the increases in
current and fixed assets plus goodwill, and this markup is also reflected in Firm A’s
post-merger equity account.27
Income Statement Effects
A merger can have a significant effect on reported profits. If asset values are
increased, as they often are under a purchase, then this must be reflected in higher
depreciation charges (and also in a higher cost of goods sold if inventories are written
up). This, in turn, will further reduce reported profits. Prior to 2001, goodwill was
also amortized over its expected life. Now, however, goodwill is subject to an “annual
impairment test.” If the fair market value of the goodwill has declined over the year,
then the amount of the decline must be charged to earnings. If not, then there is no
charge, but gains in goodwill cannot be added to earnings.
Table 21-5 illustrates the income statement effects of the write-up of current and
fixed assets. We assume A purchased B for $50, creating $10 of goodwill and $10 of
higher physical asset value. As Column 3 indicates, the asset markups cause reported
profits to be lower than the sum of the individual companies’ reported profits.
The asset markup is also reflected in earnings per share. In our hypothetical
merger, we assume that nine shares exist in the consolidated firm. (Six of these shares
went to A’s stockholders, and three went to B’s.) The merged company’s EPS is
$2.33, whereas each of the individual companies’ EPS was $2.40.

(depreciation and cost of goods sold) caused by the physical asset markup at the time of purchase.
bBefore the merger, Firm A had six shares and Firm B had three shares. Firm A gives one of its
shares for each of Firm B’s, so A has nine shares outstanding after the merger.
27This example assumes that additional debt was not issued to help finance the acquisition. If the acquisi-
tion were totally debt financed, then the post-merger balance sheet would show an increase in debt rather
than an increase in the equity account. If it were financed by a mix of debt and equity, both accounts
would increase. If the acquisition were paid for with cash on hand, then current assets would decrease by
the amount paid and the equity account would not increase.

21.14 ANALYSIS FOR A “TRUE CONSOLIDATION”
Most of our analysis in the preceding sections assumed that one firm plans to
acquire another. However, in many situations it is hard to identify an “acquirer”
and a “target”—the merger appears to be a true “merger of equals,” as was the case
with the Exxon–Mobil and First Union–Wachovia mergers. In such cases, how is the
analysis handled?
The first step is to estimate the value of the combined enterprise, incorporating
any synergies, tax effects, or capital structure changes. The second step is to decide
how to allocate the new company’s stock between the two sets of old stockholders.
Because of synergy, one would normally expect the consolidated value to exceed the
sum of the pre-announcement values of the two companies. For example, Company
A might have had a pre-merger equity value of $10 billion, found as (Number of
shares)(Price per share), and Company B might have had a pre-merger value of $15
billion. If the post-merger value of new Company AB is estimated to be $30 billion,
then that value must be allocated. Company A’s stockholders must receive enough
shares to give them a projected value of at least $10 billion, and Company B’s stock-
holders must to receive at least $15 billion. But how will the remaining $5 billion of
synergistically induced value be divided?
This is a key issue, requiring intense negotiation between the two management
groups. There is no rule or formula that can be applied, but one basis for the allocation
is the relative pre-announcement values of the two companies. For example, in our
hypothetical merger of A and B to form AB, the companies might agree to give $10/
$25 = 40% of the new stock to A’s stockholders and 60% to B’s stockholders. Unless a
case could be made for giving a higher percentage of the shares to one of the companies
because it was responsible for more of the synergistic value, then the pre-merger value
proportions would seem to be a “fair” solution. In any event, the pre-merger propor-
tions will probably be given the greatest weight in reaching the final decision.
It should also be noted that control of the consolidated company is always an
issue. Generally, the companies hold a press conference and announce that the
CEO of one firm will be chairman of the new company, that the other CEO will be
president, that the new board will consist of directors from both old boards, and that
power will be shared. With huge mergers such as those we have been seeing lately,
there is plenty of power to be shared.

How does merger analysis differ in the case of a large company acquiring a smaller
one versus a “true merger of equals”?
Do you think the same guidelines for allocating synergistic gains would be used in
both types of mergers?
21.15 THE ROLE OF INVESTMENT BANKERS
Investment bankers are involved with mergers in a number of ways: (1) they help
arrange mergers, (2) they help target companies develop and implement defensive
tactics, (3) they help value target companies, (4) they help finance mergers, and (5)
they invest in the stocks of potential merger candidates.
Chapter 21: Mergers, LBOs, Divestitures, and Holding Companies
855

Arranging Mergers
The major investment banking firms have merger and acquisition groups that operate
within their corporate finance departments. (Corporate finance departments offer
advice, as opposed to underwriting or brokerage services, to business firms.) Mem-
bers of these groups identify firms with excess cash that might want to buy other
firms, companies that might be willing to be bought, and firms that might, for a
number of reasons, be attractive to others. Sometimes dissident stockholders of firms
with poor track records work with investment bankers to oust management by help-
ing to arrange a merger.
Developing Defensive Tactics
Target firms that do not want to be acquired generally enlist the help of an invest-
ment banking firm along with a law firm that specializes in mergers. Defenses include
such tactics as (1) changing the bylaws so that only one-third of the directors are
elected each year and/or so that a 75% approval (a super majority) rather than a sim-
ple majority is required to approve a merger, (2) trying to convince the target firm’s
stockholders that the price being offered is too low, (3) raising antitrust issues in the
hope that the Justice Department will intervene, (4) repurchasing stock in the open
market in an effort to push the price above that being offered by the potential
acquirer, (5) finding a white knight who is acceptable to the target firm’s manage-
ment to compete with the potential acquirer, and (6) finding a white squire who is
friendly to current management and can buy enough of the target firm’s shares to
block the merger.
Establishing a Fair Value
If a friendly merger is being worked out between two firms’ managements, then it is
important to document that the agreed-upon price is a fair one; otherwise, the stock-
holders of either company may sue to block the merger. Therefore, in most large
mergers, each side will hire an investment banking firm to evaluate the target com-
pany and to help establish the fair price. Even if the merger is not friendly, invest-
ment bankers may still be asked to help establish a price. If a surprise tender offer is
to be made, then the acquiring firm will want to know the lowest price at which it
might be able to acquire the stock while the target firm may seek help in “proving”
that the price being offered is too low.
Financing Mergers
To be successful in the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) business, an investment
banker must be able to offer a financing package to clients—whether they are
acquirers who need capital to take over companies or target companies trying to
finance stock repurchase plans or other defenses against takeovers. In fact, the fees
that investment banks generate though issuing merger-related debt often dwarf their
other merger-related fees.
Arbitrage Operations
Arbitrage generally means simultaneously buying and selling the same commodity or
security in two different markets at different prices and pocketing a risk-free return.
However, the major brokerage houses, as well as some wealthy private investors, are
engaged in a different type of arbitrage called risk arbitrage. The arbitrageurs, or
“arbs,” speculate in the stocks of companies that are likely takeover targets. Vast
856
Part 9: Special Topics

amounts of capital are required to speculate in a large number of securities and thus
reduce risk, and also to make money on narrow spreads. Yet the large investment
bankers have the wherewithal to play this game. To be successful, arbs must be able
to sniff out likely targets, assess the probability of offers reaching fruition, and move
in and out of the market quickly and with low transaction costs.

21.16 WHO WINS: THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE
The magnitude of the merger market raises two questions: (1) Do corporate acquisi-
tions create value? (2) If so, how is the value shared between the parties?
Most researchers agree that takeovers increase the wealth of the shareholders of
target firms, for otherwise they would not agree to the offer. However, there is a
debate as to whether mergers benefit the acquiring firm’s shareholders. In particular,
managements of acquiring firms may be motivated by factors other than maximizing
shareholder wealth. For example, they may want to merge merely to increase the size
of the corporations they manage, because increased size usually brings larger salaries
plus job security, perquisites, power, and prestige.
The question of who gains from corporate acquisitions can be tested by examining
the stock price changes that occur around the time of a merger or takeover
announcement. Changes in the stock prices of the acquiring and target firms repre-
sent market participants’ beliefs about the value created by the merger and about how
that value will be divided between the target and acquiring firms’ shareholders.
Therefore, examining a large sample of stock price movements can shed light on
the issue of who gains from mergers.
One cannot simply examine stock prices around merger announcement dates, be-
cause other factors influence stock prices. For example, if a merger was announced
on a day when the entire market advanced, then a rise in the target firm’s price
would not necessarily signify that the merger was expected to create value. Hence,
studies examine abnormal returns associated with merger announcements, where ab-
normal returns are defined as that part of a stock price change caused by factors
other than changes in the general stock market.
These “event studies” have examined both acquiring and target firms’ stock price
responses to mergers and tender offers.28 Jointly, they have covered nearly every
acquisition involving publicly traded firms from the early 1960s to the present, and
they are remarkably consistent in their results: On average, the stock prices of target
firms increase by about 30% in hostile tender offers, whereas in friendly mergers the
average increase is about 20%. However, for both hostile and friendly deals, the
stock prices of acquiring firms, on average, remain constant. Thus, the event study
evidence strongly indicates (1) that acquisitions do create value but (2) that share-
holders of target firms reap virtually all the benefits.
The event study evidence suggests that mergers benefit targets but not acquirers—
and hence that an acquiring firm’s stockholders should be skeptical of its managers’
plans for acquisitions. This evidence cannot be dismissed out of hand, but neither is

it entirely convincing. There are undoubtedly many good mergers, just as there are
many poorly conceived ones. Like most of finance, merger decisions should be stud-
ied carefully, and it is best not to judge the outcome of a specific merger until the
actual results start to come in.

21.17 CORPORATE ALLIANCES
Mergers are one way for two companies to join forces, but many companies are strik-
ing cooperative deals, called corporate, or strategic, alliances, which stop far short
of merging. Whereas mergers combine all of the assets of the firms involved, as well
as their ownership and managerial expertise, alliances allow firms to create combina-
tions that focus on specific business lines that offer the most potential synergies.
These alliances take many forms, from simple marketing agreements to joint owner-
ship of worldwide operations.
One form of corporate alliance is the joint venture, in which parts of companies
are joined to achieve specific, limited objectives. A joint venture is controlled by a
management team consisting of representatives of the two (or more) parent compa-
nies. A study of 345 corporate alliances found that the stock prices of both partners
in an alliance tended to increase when the alliance was announced, with an average
Merger Mistakes
Academics have long known that acquiring firms’
shareholders rarely reap the benefits of mergers.
However, this important information never seemed to
make it up to the offices of corporate America’s deci-
sion makers; the 1990s saw bad deal after bad deal
and with no apparent learning on the part of acquisi-
tive executives. BusinessWeek published an analysis
of 302 large mergers from 1995 to 2001, and it found
that 61% of them led to losses by the acquiring firms’
shareholders.
Indeed,
those
losing
shareholders’
returns during the first post-merger year averaged
25 percentage points less than the returns on other
companies in their industry. The average returns for
all the merging companies, both winners and losers,
were 4.3% below industry averages and 9.2% below
the S&P 500.
The article cited four common mistakes:
1.
The acquiring firms often overpaid. Generally, the
acquirers gave away all of the synergies from the
mergers to the acquired firms’ shareholders, and
then some.
2.
Management overestimated the synergies (cost
savings and revenue gains) that would result from
the merger.
3.
Management took too long to integrate operations
between the merged companies. This irritated
customers and employees alike, and it postponed
any gains from the integration.
4.
Some companies cut costs too deeply at the
expense of maintaining sales and production
infrastructures.
The worst performance came from companies that
paid for their acquisitions with stock. The best perfor-
mance,
albeit
a
paltry
0.3%
better
than
industry
averages, came from companies that used cash for
their acquisitions. On the bright side, the shareholders
of the companies that were acquired fared quite well,
earning on average 19.3% more than their industry
peers, and all of those gains came in the two weeks sur-
rounding the merger announcement.

abnormal return of about 0.64% on the day of the announcement.29 About 43% of
the alliances were marketing agreements, 14% were R&D agreements, 11% were for
licensing technology, 7% for technology transfers, and 25% were for some combina-
tion of these four reasons. Although most alliances were for marketing agreements,
the market reacted most favorably when the alliance was for technology sharing
between two firms in the same industry. The study also found that the typical alli-
ance lasted at least 5 years and that the allied firms had better operating performance
than their industry peers during this period.

21.18 LEVERAGED BUYOUTS
In a leveraged buyout (LBO), a small group of investors, often led by a private
equity fund, acquires a firm in a transaction financed largely by debt. The debt is ser-
viced with funds generated by the acquired company’s operations and often by the
sale of some of its assets. Generally, the acquiring group keeps the current manage-
ment team and provides them with incentive compensation plans. The objective is to
run the acquired company for a number of years, boost its value, and then take it
public again as a stronger company. In other instances, the acquiring firm plans to
sell off divisions to other firms that can gain synergies. In either case, the acquiring
group expects to make a substantial profit from the LBO, but the inherent risks are
great owing to the heavy use of financial leverage.30

What is an LBO?
21.19 DIVESTITURES
There are four types of divestitures. Sale to another firm generally involves the
sale of an entire division or unit, usually for cash but sometimes for stock in the
acquiring firm. In a spin-off, the firm’s existing stockholders are given new stock
representing separate ownership rights in the division that was divested. The division
establishes its own board of directors and officers, and it becomes a separate com-
pany. The stockholders end up owning shares of two firms instead of one, but no
cash has been transferred. In a carve-out, a minority interest in a corporate subsidi-
ary is sold to new shareholders, so the parent gains new equity financing yet retains
control. In a liquidation, the assets of a division are sold off piecemeal to many pur-
chasers rather than as an single operating entity to one purchaser. To illustrate the
different types of divestitures, we now present some examples.

In 2009, Time Warner announced that it planned to spin off AOL, the dissolution
of a merger that had never worked. In 2008, Cadbury Schweppes decided to focus on
its chocolate and candy businesses, so it spun off soft-drink brands into a separately
traded company, the Dr Pepper Snapple Group. The Altria Group completed its
spin-off of Kraft Foods in 2007 and then spun off its international cigarette opera-
tions into Phillip Morris International, which allowed the group to focus on domestic
cigarette operations, smokeless tobacco, and premium wines.
As these examples illustrate, the reasons for divestitures vary widely. Sometimes
the market feels more comfortable when firms “stick to their knitting,” as the Cad-
bury Schweppes divestiture illustrates. Sometimes companies need cash either to
finance expansion in their primary business lines or to reduce a large debt burden,
and divestitures can be used to raise this cash; for example, AMD spun off its
manufacturing operations in 2009. The divestitures also show that running a business
is a dynamic process—conditions change, corporate strategies change in response,
and consequently firms alter their asset portfolios by acquisitions and/or divestitures.
Some divestitures are designed to unload losing assets that would otherwise drag the
company down, such as Time Warner’s planned spin-off of AOL.
In general, the empirical evidence shows that the market reacts favorably to dives-
titures, with the divesting company typically having a small increase in stock price on
the day of the announcement. The announcement-day returns are largest for compa-
nies that “undo” previous conglomerate mergers by divesting businesses in unrelated
areas.31 Studies also show that divestitures generally lead to superior operating per-
formance for both the parent and the divested company.32

21.20 HOLDING COMPANIES
Holding companies date from 1889, when New Jersey became the first state to pass a
law permitting corporations to be formed for the sole purpose of owning the stocks of
other companies. Many of the advantages and disadvantages of holding companies are
identical to those of any large-scale organization. Whether a company is organized on
a divisional basis or with subsidiaries kept as separate companies does not affect the
basic reasons for conducting a large-scale, multiproduct, multiplant operation.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Holding Companies
There are two principal advantages of a holding company.
1. Control with fractional ownership. Through a holding company operation, a firm
may buy 5%, 10%, or 50% of the stock of another corporation. Such fractional
ownership may be sufficient to give the holding company effective working con-
trol over the operations of the company in which it has acquired stock ownership.
Working control is often considered to entail more than 25% of the common
31For details, see Jeffrey W. Allen, Scott L. Lummer, John J. McConnell, and Debra K. Reed, “Can
Takeover Losses Explain Spin-off Gains?” Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, December 1995,

porate Investment and Performance,” Journal of Financial Research, Summer 1996, pp. 293–307. Also see

Journal of Finance, March 1992, pp. 107–138.

Part 9: Special Topics

stock, but it can be as low as 10% if the stock is widely distributed. One financier
says that the attitude of management is more important than the number of
shares owned: “If management thinks you can control the company, then you
do.” In addition, control on a very slim margin can be held through relationships
with large stockholders outside the holding company group.
2. Isolation of risks. Because the various operating companies in a holding company
system are separate legal entities, the obligations of any one unit are separate
from those of the other units. Therefore, catastrophic losses incurred by one unit
of the holding company system may not be translatable into claims on the assets
of the other units. However, we should note that while this is a customary gen-
eralization, it is not always valid. First, the parent company may feel obligated to
make good on the subsidiary’s debts, even though it is not legally bound to do so,
in order to keep its good name and to retain customers. Second, a parent com-
pany may feel obligated to supply capital to an affiliate in order to protect its
initial investment. And third, when lending to one of the units of a holding
company system, an astute loan officer may require a guarantee by the parent
holding company. To some degree, then, the assets in the various elements of a
holding company are not really separate.
The main disadvantage of a holding company involves partial multiple taxation. Pro-
vided the holding company owns at least 80% of a subsidiary’s voting stock, the IRS per-
mits the filing of consolidated returns, in which case dividends received by the parent are
not taxed. However, if less than 80% of the stock is owned, then tax returns cannot be
consolidated. Firms that own more than 20% but less than 80% of another corporation
can deduct 80% of the dividends received, whereas firms that own less than 20% may
deduct only 70% of the dividends received. This partial double taxation somewhat off-
sets the benefits of holding company control with limited ownership, but whether the
tax penalty is sufficient to offset other possible advantages varies from case to case.
Holding Companies as a Leveraging Device
The holding company vehicle has been used to obtain huge degrees of financial le-
verage. In the 1920s, several tiers of holding companies were established in the elec-
tric utility, railroad, and other industries. In those days, an operating company at the
bottom of the pyramid might have $100 million of assets, financed by $50 million of
debt and $50 million of equity. Then, a first-tier holding company might own the stock
of the operating firm as its only asset and be financed with $25 million of debt and
$25 million of equity. A second-tier holding company, which owned the stock of the
first-tier company, might be financed with $12.5 million of debt and $12.5 million of
equity. Such systems were extended to five or six levels. With six holding companies,
$100 million of operating assets could be controlled at the top by only $0.78 million of
equity, and the operating assets would have to provide enough cash income to support
$99.22 million of debt. Such a holding company system is highly leveraged—its consolidated
debt ratio is 99.22%, even though each of the individual components shows only a 50% debt/assets
ratio. Because of this consolidated leverage, even a small decline in profits at the operat-
ing company level could bring the whole system down like a house of cards. This situa-
tion existed in the electric utility industry in the 1920s, and the Depression of the 1930s
wreaked such havoc with the holding companies that federal legislation was enacted that
constrained holding companies in that industry.

Summary
•
A merger occurs when two firms combine to form a single company. The pri-
mary motives for mergers are (1) synergy, (2) tax considerations, (3) purchase of
assets below their replacement costs, (4) diversification, (5) gaining control over a
larger enterprise, and (6) breakup value.
•
Mergers can provide economic benefits through economies of scale and
through putting assets in the hands of more efficient managers. However,
mergers also have the potential for reducing competition, and for this reason
they are carefully regulated by government agencies.
•
In most mergers, one company (the acquiring company) initiates action to take
over another (the target company).
•
A horizontal merger occurs when two firms in the same line of business
combine.
•
A vertical merger combines a firm with one of its customers or suppliers.
•
A congeneric merger involves firms in related industries but where no cus-
tomer–supplier relationship exists.
•
A conglomerate merger occurs when firms in totally different industries
combine.
•
In a friendly merger, the managements of both firms approve the merger,
whereas in a hostile merger, the target firm’s management opposes it.
•
An operating merger is one in which the operations of the two firms are com-
bined. A financial merger is one in which the firms continue to operate sepa-
rately; hence no operating economies are expected.
•
In a typical merger analysis, the key issues to be resolved are (1) the price to be
paid for the target firm and (2) the employment/control situation. If the merger
is a consolidation of two relatively equal firms, at issue is the percentage of
ownership that each merger partner’s shareholders will receive.
•
Four methods are commonly used to determine the value of the target firm: (1)
market multiple analysis, (2) the corporate valuation model, (3) the free cash
flow to equity (FCFE) model, and (4) the adjusted present value (APV)
model. The three cash flow models give the same value if implemented cor-
rectly, but the APV model is the easiest to implement correctly and should be
used when the capital structure is changing.
•
For accounting purposes, mergers are handled as a purchase.
•
A joint venture is a corporate alliance in which two or more companies com-
bine some of their resources to achieve a specific, limited objective.
•
A leveraged buyout (LBO) is a transaction in which a firm’s publicly owned
stock is acquired in a mostly debt-financed tender offer, resulting in a privately
owned, highly leveraged firm. Often, the firm’s own management initiates the
LBO.
•
A divestiture is the sale of some of a company’s operating assets. A divestiture
may involve (1) selling an operating unit to another firm, (2) spinning off a unit
as a separate company, (3) carving out a unit by selling a minority interest, or (4)
the outright liquidation of a unit’s assets.
•
The reasons for divestiture include (1) to settle antitrust suits, (2) to improve
the transparency of the resulting companies so that investors can more easily
evaluate them, (3) to enable management to concentrate on a particular type of
activity, and (4) to raise the capital needed to strengthen the corporation’s core
business.
862
Part 9: Special Topics

•
A holding company is a corporation that owns sufficient stock in another firm
to control it. The holding company is also known as the parent company, and
the companies that it controls are called subsidiaries, or operating companies.
•
Holding company operations are advantageous because (1) control can often be
obtained for a smaller cash outlay, (2) risks may be segregated, and (3) regulated
companies can operate separate subsidiaries for their regulated and unregulated
businesses.
•
A major disadvantages to holding company operations is the possibility of multi-
ple taxation.

If Vandell has $10.82 million in debt, what is the current value of Vandell’s stock?
(Hint: Use the corporate valuation model from Chapter 13.)
INTERMEDIATE PROBLEMS 2–3
(21–2)
Merger Valuation
Hastings estimates that if it acquires Vandell, interest payments will be $1,500,000
per year for 3 years, after which the current target capital structure of 30% debt
will be maintained. Interest in the fourth year will be $1.472 million, after which
interest and the tax shield will grow at 5%. Synergies will cause the free cash flows
to be $2.5 million, $2.9 million, $3.4 million, and $3.57 million in Years 1 through 4,
respectively, after which the free cash flows will grow at a 5% rate. What is the
unlevered value of Vandell, and what is the value of its tax shields? What is the per
share value of Vandell to Hastings Corporation? Assume that Vandell now has
$10.82 million in debt.
(21–3)
Merger Bid
On the basis of your answers to Problems 21-1 and 21-2, indicate the range of possi-
ble prices that Hastings could bid for each share of Vandell common stock in an
acquisition.
CHALLENGING PROBLEMS 4–6

Merger Valuation with
Change in Capital
Structure
Assuming the same information as for Problem 21-2, suppose Hastings will increase
Vandell’s level of debt at the end of Year 3 to $30.6 million so that the target capital
structure is now 45% debt. Assume that with this higher level of debt the interest
rate would be 8.5%, and assume that interest payments in Year 4 are based on the
new debt level from the end of Year 3 and a new interest rate. Again, free cash flows
and tax shields are projected to grow at 5% after Year 4. What are the values of the
unlevered firm and the tax shield, and what is the maximum price that Hastings
would bid for Vandell now?

Merger Analysis
Marston Marble Corporation is considering a merger with the Conroy Concrete
Company. Conroy is a publicly traded company, and its beta is 1.30. Conroy has
been barely profitable, so it has paid an average of only 20% in taxes during the last
864
Part 9: Special Topics

several years. In addition, it uses little debt; its target ratio is just 25%, with the cost
of debt 9%.
If the acquisition were made, Marston would operate Conroy as a separate, wholly
owned subsidiary. Marston would pay taxes on a consolidated basis, and the tax rate
would therefore increase to 35%. Marston also would increase the debt capitalization
in the Conroy subsidiary to wd = 40%, for a total of $22.27 million in debt by the
end of Year 4, and pay 9.5% on the debt. Marston’s acquisition department estimates
that Conroy, if acquired, would generate the following free cash flows and interest
expenses (in millions of dollars) in Years 1–5:

In Year 5, Conroy’s interest expense would be based on its beginning-of-year (that is,
the end-of-Year-4) debt, and in subsequent years both interest expense and free cash
flows are projected to grow at a rate of 6%.
These cash flows include all acquisition effects. Marston’s cost of equity is 10.5%,
its beta is 1.0, and its cost of debt is 9.5%. The risk-free rate is 6%, and the market
risk premium is 4.5%.
a. What is the value of Conroy’s unlevered operations, and what is the value of
Conroy’s tax shields under the proposed merger and financing arrangements?
b. What is the dollar value of Conroy’s operations? If Conroy has $10 million in
debt outstanding, how much would Marston be willing to pay for Conroy?

If the acquisition is made, it will occur on January 1, 2011. All cash flows shown in
the income statements are assumed to occur at the end of the year. ACC currently
has a capital structure of 30% debt, which costs 9%, but Wansley would increase
that over time to 40%, costing 10%, if the acquisition were made. ACC, if indepen-
dent, would pay taxes at 30%, but its income would be taxed at 35% if it were con-
solidated. ACC’s current market-determined beta is 1.4. The cost of goods sold,
which includes depreciation, is expected to be 65% of sales, but it could vary some-
what. Required gross investment in operating capital is approximately equal to the
depreciation charged, so there will be no investment in net operating capital. The
risk-free rate is 7%, and the market risk premium is 6.5%. Wansley currently has
$400,000 in debt outstanding.
a. What is the unlevered cost of equity?

of ACC’s equity to Wansley’s shareholders?
Mini Case
Hager’s Home Repair Company, a regional hardware chain that specializes in “do it yourself”
materials and equipment rentals, is cash rich because of several consecutive good years. One of
the alternative uses for the excess funds is an acquisition. Doug Zona, Hager’s treasurer and
your boss, has been asked to place a value on a potential target, Lyons Lighting (LL), a chain
that operates in several adjacent states, and he has enlisted your help.
The table below indicates Zona’s estimates of LL’s earnings potential if it came under Ha-
ger’s management (in millions of dollars). The interest expense listed here includes the interest
resource
866
Part 9: Special Topics

(1) on LL’s existing debt, which is $55 million at a rate of 9%, and (2) on new debt expected
to be issued over time to help finance expansion within the new “L division,” the code name
given to the target firm. If acquired, LL will face a 40% tax rate.
Security analysts estimate LL’s beta to be 1.3. The acquisition would not change Lyons’s
capital structure, which is 20% debt. Zona realizes that Lyons Lighting’s business plan also
requires certain levels of operating capital and that the annual investment could be significant.
The required levels of total net operating capital are listed in the table.
Zona estimates the risk-free rate to be 7% and the market risk premium to be 4%. He also
estimates that free cash flows after 2015 will grow at a constant rate of 6%. Following are pro-
jections for sales and other items.
Hager’s management is new to the merger game, so Zona has been asked to answer some basic
questions about mergers as well as to perform the merger analysis. To structure the task, Zona has
developed the following questions, which you must answer and then defend to Hager’s board.
a. Several reasons have been proposed to justify mergers. Among the more prominent are
(1) tax considerations, (2) risk reduction, (3) control, (4) purchase of assets at below re-
placement cost, (5) synergy, and (6) globalization. In general, which of the reasons are
economically justifiable? Which are not? Which fit the situation at hand? Explain.
b. Briefly describe the differences between a hostile merger and a friendly merger.
c. What are the steps in valuing a merger?
d. Use the data developed in the table to construct the L division’s free cash flows for
2011 through 2015. Why are we identifying interest expense separately when it is not
normally included in calculating free cash flows or in a capital budgeting cash flow anal-
ysis? Why is investment in net operating capital included when calculating the free cash
flow?
e. Conceptually, what is the appropriate discount rate to apply to the cash flows developed
in part c? What is your actual estimate of this discount rate?
f. What is the estimated horizon, or continuing, value of the acquisition; that is, what is
the estimated value of the L division’s cash flows beyond 2015? What is LL’s value to
Hager’s shareholders? Suppose another firm were evaluating LL as an acquisition candi-
date. Would it obtain the same value? Explain.
g. Assume that LL has 20 million shares outstanding. These shares are traded relatively
infrequently, but the last trade (made several weeks ago) was at a price of $11 per share.
Should Hager’s make an offer for Lyons Lighting? If so, how much should it offer per
share?
h. How would the analysis be different if Hager’s intended to recapitalize LL with 40%
debt costing 10% at the end of 4 years? This amounts to $221.6 million in debt as of
the end of 2014.
i. There has been considerable research undertaken to determine whether mergers really
create value and, if so, how this value is shared between the parties involved. What are
the results of this research?
j. What method is used to account for mergers?
k. What merger-related activities are undertaken by investment bankers?
l. What is a leveraged buyout (LBO)? What are some of the advantages and disadvantages
of going private?
m. What are the major types of divestitures? What motivates firms to divest assets?
n. What are holding companies? What are their advantages and disadvantages?

L
ehman Brothers, Washington Mutual, Chrysler, and General Motors all
filed for bankruptcy protection during the global economic crisis. What
did these four filings have in common with Australia? At the time of
filings, the companies’ assets totaled over $1.1 trillion dollars, which is
about the same size as Australia’s annual gross domestic product.
With $691 billion in assets, Lehman Brothers holds the record for the
largest bankruptcy filing in history. Lehman Brothers had not emerged
from bankruptcy when we wrote this (August 2009), but it is unlikely that
Lehman Brothers will again operate as a company. Most of its operations
and assets have been liquidated and sold piecemeal to other companies,
including Barclays.
Washington Mutual (WaMu) once was the largest S&L in the United
States, with total assets of $328 billion in September 2008. But when it
sustained enormous losses related to sub-prime mortgages, WaMu was
placed into the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) receivership.
The FDIC quickly sold WaMu’s banking operations to JPMorgan Chase.
Chrysler filed for bankruptcy on April 30, 2009, and emerged from
bankruptcy 40 days later on June 10, 2009. As part of the deal, Chrysler’s
new owners include its employees/retirees (through pension and health
care funds), Fiat, and the U.S. government. Cerberus Capital, a private
equity fund that was Chrysler’s owner prior to the bankruptcy, lost its
entire

When GM filed for bankruptcy on June 1, it became the largest
manufacturer in U.S. history to fail. When GM emerged from bankruptcy
40 days later, the U.S. government owned 60.8% of the equity in the
“new” GM, with the remaining equity owned by the Canadian government
(11.7%), the UAW employee health care trust (17.5%), and former
bondholders (10%). Notice that nothing was left for former stockholders.
As you read this chapter, think about the decisions that were made in
the bankruptcy processes of these four companies.

Thus far, we have dealt with issues faced by growing, successful enterprises. However,
many firms encounter financial difficulties, and some—including such big names as
General Motors, Chrysler, Delta Air Lines, and Lehman Brothers—are forced into
bankruptcy. When a firm encounters financial distress, its managers must try to ward
off a total collapse and thereby minimize losses. The ability to hang on during rough
times often means the difference between forced liquidation versus rehabilitation and
eventual success. An understanding of bankruptcy is also critical to the executives of
healthy firms, because they must know the best actions to take when their customers
or suppliers face the threat of bankruptcy.
22.1 FINANCIAL DISTRESS AND ITS CONSEQUENCES
We begin with some background on financial distress and its consequences.1
Causes of Business Failure
A company’s intrinsic value is the present value of its expected future free cash flows.
There are many factors that can cause this value to decline. These factors include
general economic conditions, industry trends, and company-specific problems such
as shifting consumer tastes, obsolescent technology, and changing demographics in
existing retail locations. Financial factors, such as too much debt and unexpected in-
creases in interest rates, can also cause business failures. The importance of the dif-
ferent factors varies over time, and most business failures occur because a number of
factors combine to make the business unsustainable. Further, case studies show that
financial difficulties are usually the result of a series of errors, misjudgments, and in-
terrelated weaknesses that can be attributed directly or indirectly to management. In
a few cases, such as Enron and WorldCom, fraud leads to bankruptcy.
As you might guess, signs of potential financial distress are generally evident in a
ratio analysis long before the firm actually fails, and researchers use ratio analysis to
predict the probability that a given firm will go bankrupt. Financial analysts con-
stantly are seeking ways to assess a firm’s likelihood of going bankrupt. We discuss
one method, multiple discriminant analysis (MDA), in Web Extension 22A.
The Business Failure Record
Although bankruptcy is more frequent among smaller firms, it is clear from Table 22-1
that large firms are not immune. This is especially true in the current global economic
crisis: Five of the largest bankruptcies occurred in 2008 and 2009.
Bankruptcy obviously is painful for a company’s shareholders, but it also can be
harmful to the economy if the company is very large or is in a critical sector. For
example, the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 sparked a global run
on financial institutions that froze credit markets and contributed to the ensuing
global recession. It is not clear whether the damage to the world economy could
have been mitigated if the government had intervened to prevent Lehman’s failure,
but the government subsequently decided not to take chances with many other trou-
bled financial institutions. For example, the government helped arrange the 2008
acquisition of Wachovia by Wells Fargo, the 2008 acquisition of Bear Sterns by
JPMorgan Chase, and the 2009 acquisition of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America
(despite Bank of America’s misgivings). In addition, the government provided billions

of dollars of capital to many major financial institutions in 2008, including AIG. In
each of these cases, the government decided that a complete failure of these institu-
tions might cause the entire financial system to collapse.
In other cases, the government has decided that a company was too important to
the nonfinancial side of the economy to be allowed to go through liquidation. For
example, in 2008 and 2009 the government provided billions of dollars of financing
to General Motors and Chrysler. Even thought these companies subsequently went
through bankruptcy proceedings in 2009, they avoided liquidation, still have a signif-
icant number of employees, and remain major players in the automobile industry. In
past years, the government also has intervened to support troubled firms in other
critical sectors, such as Lockheed and Douglas Aircraft in the defense industry.

22.2 ISSUES FACING A FIRM IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS
Financial distress begins when a firm is unable to meet scheduled payments or when
cash flow projections indicate that it will soon be unable to do so. As the situation
develops, five central issues arise.
1. Is the firm’s inability to meet scheduled debt payments a temporary cash flow
problem, or is it a permanent problem caused by asset values having fallen below
debt obligations?
2. If the problem is a temporary one, then an agreement with creditors that gives
the firm time to recover and to satisfy everyone may be worked out. However, if
basic long-run asset values have truly declined, then economic losses have
occurred. In this event, who should bear the losses, and who should get whatever
value remains?
3. Is the company “worth more dead than alive”? That is, would the business be
more valuable if it were liquidated and sold off in pieces or if it were maintained
and continued in operation?

4. Should the firm file for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act, or
should it try to use informal procedures? (Both reorganization and liquidation
can be accomplished either informally or under the direction of a bankruptcy
court.)
5. Who should control the firm while it is being liquidated or rehabilitated? Should the
existing management be left in charge, or should a trustee be placed in charge of
operations?
In the remainder of the chapter, we discuss these issues in turn.

What five major issues must be addressed when a firm faces financial distress?
22.3 SETTLEMENTS WITHOUT GOING
THROUGH FORMAL BANKRUPTCY
When a firm experiences financial distress, its managers and creditors must decide
whether the problem is temporary and the firm is really financially viable or whether
a permanent problem exists that endangers the firm’s life. Then the parties must
decide whether to try to solve the problem informally or under the direction of a
bankruptcy court. Because of costs associated with formal bankruptcy—including
the disruptions that occur when a firm’s customers, suppliers, and employees learn
that it has filed under the Bankruptcy Act—it is preferable to reorganize (or liqui-
date) outside of formal bankruptcy. We first discuss informal settlement procedures
and then the procedures under a formal bankruptcy.
Informal Reorganization
In the case of an economically sound company whose financial difficulties appear to
be temporary, creditors are generally willing to work with the company to help it
recover and reestablish itself on a sound financial basis. Such voluntary plans, com-
monly called workouts, usually require a restructuring of the firm’s debt, because
current cash flows are insufficient to service the existing debt. Restructuring typically
involves extension and/or composition. In an extension, creditors postpone the dates
of required interest or principal payments, or both. In a composition, creditors
voluntarily reduce their fixed claims on the debtor by accepting a lower principal
amount, by reducing the interest rate on the debt, by taking equity in exchange for
debt, or by some combination of these changes.
A debt restructuring begins with a meeting between the failing firm’s managers and
creditors. The creditors appoint a committee consisting of four or five of the largest
creditors plus one or two of the smaller ones. This meeting is often arranged and
conducted by an adjustment bureau associated with and run by a local credit man-
agers’ association.2 The first step is for management to draw up a list of creditors that
shows the amounts of debt owed. There are typically different classes of debt, ranging
from first-mortgage holders to unsecured creditors. Next, the company develops infor-
mation showing the value of the firm under different scenarios. Typically, one scenario
is going out of business, selling off the assets, and then distributing the proceeds to the
various creditors in accordance with the priority of their claims, with any surplus going
2There is a nationwide group called the National Association of Credit Management, which consists of
bankers and industrial companies’ credit managers. This group sponsors research on credit policy and
problems, conducts seminars on credit management, and operates local chapters in cities throughout the
nation. These local chapters frequently operate adjustment bureaus.

to the common stockholders. The company may hire an appraiser to get an appraisal of
the value of the firm’s property to use as a basis for this scenario. Other scenarios in-
clude continued operations, frequently with some improvements in capital equipment,
marketing, and perhaps some management changes.
This information is then shared with the firm’s bankers and other creditors.
Frequently, it can be demonstrated that the firm’s debts exceed its liquidating value,
and the legal fees and other costs associated with a formal liquidation under federal
bankruptcy procedures will materially lower the net proceeds available to creditors.
Furthermore, it generally takes at least a year (and often several years) to resolve
matters in a formal proceeding, so the present value of the eventual proceeds will be
lower still. This information, when presented in a credible manner, often convinces
creditors they would be better off accepting something less than the full amount of
their claims rather than holding out for the full face amount. If management and the
major creditors agree that the problems can probably be resolved, then a more
formal plan is drafted and presented to all the creditors, along with the reasons cred-
itors should be willing to compromise on their claims.
In developing the reorganization plan, creditors prefer an extension because it
promises eventual payment in full. In some cases, creditors may agree not only to
postpone the date of payment but also to subordinate existing claims to vendors
who are willing to extend new credit during the workout period. Similarly, creditors
may agree to accept a lower interest rate on loans during the extension, perhaps in
exchange for a pledge of collateral. Because of the sacrifices involved, the creditors
must have faith that the debtor firm will be able to solve its problems.
In a composition, creditors agree to reduce their claims. Typically, creditors
receive cash and/or new securities that have a combined market value that is less
than the amounts owed them. The cash and securities, which might have a value of
only 10% of the original claim, are taken as full settlement of the original debt.
Bargaining will take place between the debtor and the creditors over the savings
that result from avoiding the costs of legal bankruptcy: administrative costs, legal
fees, investigative costs, and so on. In addition to escaping such costs, the debtor
gains because the stigma of bankruptcy may be avoided. As a result, the debtor may
be induced to part with most of the savings from avoiding formal bankruptcy.
Often the bargaining process will result in a restructuring that involves both ex-
tension and composition. For example, the settlement may provide for a cash pay-
ment of 25% of the debt immediately plus a new note promising six future
installments of 10% each, for a total payment of 85%.
Voluntary settlements are both informal and simple; they are also relatively inex-
pensive, because legal and administrative expenses are held to a minimum. Thus, vol-
untary procedures generally result in the largest return to creditors. Although
creditors do not obtain immediate payment and may even have to accept less than is
owed them, they generally recover more money, and sooner, than if the firm were to
file for bankruptcy.
In recent years, the fact that restructurings can sometimes help creditors avoid
showing a loss has motivated some creditors, especially banks and insurance companies,
to agree to voluntary restructurings. Thus, a bank “in trouble” with its regulators over
weak capital ratios may agree to extend loans that are used to pay the interest on earlier
loans—in order to keep the bank from having to write down the value of those earlier
loans. This particular type of restructuring depends on (1) the willingness of the regu-
lators to go along with the process, and (2) whether the bank is likely to recover more
in the end by restructuring the debt than by forcing the borrower into bankruptcy
immediately.
Chapter 22: Bankruptcy, Reorganization, and Liquidation
873

We should point out that informal voluntary settlements are not reserved for small
firms. International Harvester (now Navistar International) avoided formal bankruptcy
proceedings by getting its creditors to agree to restructure more than $3.5 billion of
debt. Likewise, Chrysler’s creditors accepted both an extension and a composition to
help it through its bad years in the late 1970s before it merged with Daimler-Benz.
The biggest problem with informal reorganizations is getting all the parties to
agree to the voluntary plan. This problem, called the holdout problem, is discussed in
a later section.
Informal Liquidation
When it is obvious that a firm is more valuable dead than alive, informal procedures
can also be used to liquidate the firm. Assignment is an informal procedure for
liquidating a firm, and it usually yields creditors a larger amount than they would
get in a formal bankruptcy liquidation. However, assignments are feasible only if
the firm is small and its affairs are not too complex. An assignment calls for title to
the debtor’s assets to be transferred to a third party, known as an assignee or trustee.
The assignee is instructed to liquidate the assets through a private sale or public auc-
tion and then to distribute the proceeds among the creditors on a pro rata basis. The
assignment does not automatically discharge the debtor’s obligations. However, the
debtor may have the assignee write the requisite legal language on the check to
each creditor so that endorsement of the check constitutes acknowledgment of full
settlement of the claim.
Assignment has some advantages over liquidation in federal bankruptcy courts in
terms of time, legal formality, and expense. The assignee has more flexibility in
disposing of property than does a federal bankruptcy trustee, so action can be taken
sooner, before inventory becomes obsolete or machinery rusts. Also, because the
assignee is often familiar with the debtor’s business, better results may be achieved.
However, an assignment does not automatically result in a full and legal discharge
of all the debtor’s liabilities, nor does it protect the creditors against fraud. Both of
these problems can be reduced by formal liquidation in bankruptcy, which we discuss
in a later section.

22.4 FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAW
U.S. bankruptcy laws were first enacted in 1898. They were modified substantially in
1938 and again in 1978, and some fine-tuning was done in 1986. In 2005, Congress
further modified the bankruptcy code, speeding up bankruptcy proceedings for
companies and making it more difficult for consumers to take advantage of provisions
that can wipe out certain debts. The primary purpose of the bankruptcy law is to
avoid firms that are worth more as ongoing concerns being put out of business by
individual creditors, who could force liquidation without regard to the effects on
other parties.
Currently, our bankruptcy law consists of eight odd-numbered chapters, plus one
even-numbered chapter. (The old even-numbered chapters were deleted when the act
was revised in 1978.) Chapters 1, 3, and 5 contain general provisions applicable to the
other chapters. Chapter 11, which deals with business reorganization, is the most
874
Part 9: Special Topics

important section from a financial management viewpoint. Chapter 7 details the proce-
dures to be followed when liquidating a firm; generally, Chapter 7 does not come into
play unless it has been determined that reorganization under Chapter 11 is not feasible.
Chapter 9 deals with financially distressed municipalities; Chapter 12 covers special pro-
cedures for family-owned farms; Chapter 13 covers the adjustment of debts for “indivi-
duals with regular income”; and Chapter 15 sets up a system of trustees who help
administer proceedings under the act.
A firm is officially bankrupt when it files for bankruptcy with a federal court.
When you read that a company such as Southland (the owner of the 7-Eleven conve-
nience store chain) has “filed for court protection under Chapter 11,” this means the
company is attempting to reorganize under the supervision of a bankruptcy court.
Formal bankruptcy proceedings are designed to protect both the firm and its cred-
itors. On the one hand, if the problem is temporary insolvency, then the firm may
use bankruptcy proceedings to gain time to solve its cash flow problems without asset
seizure by its creditors. On the other hand, if the firm is truly bankrupt in the sense
that liabilities exceed assets, then creditors can use bankruptcy procedures to stop the
firm’s managers from continuing to operate, lose more money, and thus deplete
assets that should go to creditors.
Bankruptcy law is flexible in that it provides scope for negotiations between a
company, its creditors, its labor force, and its stockholders. A case is opened by filing
a petition with one of the 291 bankruptcy courts serving 90 judicial districts. The
petition may be either voluntary or involuntary; that is, it may be filed either by
the firm’s management or by its creditors. After a filing, a committee of unsecured
creditors is then appointed by the Office of the U.S. Trustee to negotiate with man-
agement for a reorganization, which may include the restructuring of debt. Under
Chapter 11, a trustee will be appointed to take over the company if the court deems
current management incompetent or if fraud is suspected. Normally, though, the
existing management retains control. If no fair and feasible reorganization can be
worked out, the bankruptcy judge will order that the firm be liquidated under proce-
dures spelled out in Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act, in which case a trustee will
always be appointed.3

How does a firm formally declare bankruptcy?
22.5 REORGANIZATION IN BANKRUPTCY
It might appear that most reorganizations should be handled informally because in-
formal reorganizations are faster and less costly than formal bankruptcy. However,
two problems often arise to stymie informal reorganizations and thus force debtors
into Chapter 11 bankruptcy: the common pool problem and the holdout problem.4
To illustrate these problems, consider a firm that is having financial difficulties. It
is worth $9 million as a going concern (this is the present value of its expected future

plications for Corporations Facing Financial Distress,” Financial Management, Autumn 1996, pp. 67–85.
4The issues discussed in this section are covered in more detail in Thomas H. Jackson, The Logic and
Limits of Bankruptcy Law (Frederick, MD: Beard Group, 2001). Also see Stuart C. Gilson, “Managing De-
fault: Some Evidence on How Firms Choose between Workouts and Chapter 11,” Journal of Applied
Corporate Finance, Summer 1991, pp. 62–70; and Yehning Chen, J. Fred Weston, and Edward I. Altman,

operating cash flows) but only $7 million if it is liquidated. The firm’s debt totals $10
million at face value—ten creditors with equal priority each have a $1 million claim.
Now suppose the firm’s liquidity deteriorates to the point that it defaults on one of
its loans. The holder of that loan has the contractual right to accelerate the claim,
which means the creditor can foreclose on the loan and demand payment of the entire
balance. Further, since most debt agreements have cross-default provisions, defaulting
on one loan effectively places all loans in default.
The firm’s market value is less than the $10 million face value of debt, regardless
of whether it remains in business or liquidates. Therefore, it would be impossible to
pay off all of the creditors in full. However, the creditors in total would be better off
if the firm is not shut down, because they could ultimately recover $9 million if the
firm remains in business but only $7 million if it is liquidated. The problem here,
which is called the common pool problem, is that in the absence of protection un-
der the Bankruptcy Act, individual creditors would have an incentive to foreclose on
the firm even though it is worth more as an ongoing concern.
An individual creditor would have the incentive to foreclose because it could then
force the firm to liquidate a portion of its assets to pay off that particular creditor’s $1
million claim in full. The payment to that creditor would probably require the liqui-
dation of vital assets, which might cause a shutdown of the firm and thus lead to a
total liquidation. Therefore, the value of the remaining creditors’ claims would
decline. Of course, all the creditors would recognize the gains to be had from this
strategy, so they would storm the debtor with foreclosure notices. Even those cred-
itors who understand the merits of keeping the firm alive would be forced to fore-
close, because the foreclosures of the other creditors would reduce the payoff to
those who do not. In our hypothetical example, if seven creditors foreclosed and
forced liquidation, they would be paid in full, and the remaining three creditors
would receive nothing.
With many creditors, as soon as a firm defaults on one loan, there is the potential
for a disruptive flood of foreclosures that would make the creditors collectively worse
off. In our example, the creditors would lose $9 −$7 = $2 million in value if a flood
of foreclosures were to force the firm to liquidate. If the firm had only one creditor—
say, a single bank loan—then the common pool problem would not exist. If a bank
had loaned the company $10 million, it would not force liquidation to get $7 million
when it could keep the firm alive and eventually realize $9 million.
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act provides a solution to the common pool prob-
lem through its automatic stay provision. An automatic stay, which is forced on all cred-
itors in a bankruptcy, limits the ability of creditors to foreclose to collect their individual
claims. However, the creditors can collectively foreclose on the debtor and force
liquidation.
Although bankruptcy gives the firm a chance to work out its problems without the
threat of creditor foreclosure, management does not have a completely free rein over
the firm’s assets. First, bankruptcy law requires the debtor firm to request permission
from the court to take many actions, and the law also gives creditors the right to
petition the bankruptcy court to block almost any action the firm might take while
in bankruptcy. Second, fraudulent conveyance statutes, which are part of debtor–
creditor law, protect creditors from unjustified transfers of property by a firm in
financial distress.
To illustrate fraudulent conveyance, suppose a holding company is contemplating
bankruptcy protection for one of its subsidiaries. The holding company might be
tempted to sell some or all of the subsidiary’s assets to itself (the parent company)
for less than the true market value. This transaction would reduce the value of the
876
Part 9: Special Topics

subsidiary by the difference between the true market value of its assets and the
amount paid, and the loss would be borne primarily by the subsidiary’s creditors.
Such a transaction would be voided by the courts as a fraudulent conveyance. Note
also that transactions favoring one creditor at the expense of another can be voided
under the same law. For example, a transaction in which an asset is sold and the pro-
ceeds are used to pay one creditor in full at the expense of other creditors could be
voided. Thus, fraudulent conveyance laws also protect creditors from each other.5
The second problem that is mitigated by bankruptcy law is the holdout problem.
To illustrate this, consider again our example firm with ten creditors owed $1 million
each but with assets worth only $9 million. The goal of the firm is to avoid liquida-
tion by remedying the default. In an informal workout, this would require a reorga-
nization plan that is agreed to by each of the ten creditors. Suppose the firm offers
each creditor new debt with a face value of $850,000 in exchange for the old
$1,000,000 face value debt. If each of the creditors accepted the offer, the firm could
be successfully reorganized. The reorganization would leave the equity holders with
some value—the market value of the equity would be $9,000,000 −10($850,000) =
$500,000. Further, the creditors would have claims worth $8.5 million, much more
than the $7 million value of their claims in liquidation.
Although such an exchange offer seems to benefit all parties, it might well not be ac-
cepted by the creditors. Here’s why: Suppose seven of the ten creditors tender their
bonds; thus, seven creditors each now have claims with a face value of $850,000 each,
or $5,950,000 in total, while the three creditors that did not tender their bonds each still
have a claim with a face value of $1 million. The total face value of the debt at this point
is $8,950,000, which is less than the $9 million value of the firm. In this situation, the
three holdout creditors would receive the full face value of their debt. However, this
probably would not happen, because (1) all of the creditors would be sophisticated
enough to realize this could happen, and (2) each creditor would want to be one of the
three holdouts that gets paid in full. Thus, it is likely that none of the creditors would
accept the offer. The holdout problem makes it difficult to restructure the firm’s debts.
Again, if the firm had a single creditor, there would be no holdout problem.
The holdout problem is mitigated in bankruptcy proceedings by the bankruptcy
court’s ability to lump creditors into classes. Each class is considered to have accepted
a reorganization plan if two-thirds of the amount of debt and one-half the number of
claimants vote for the plan, and the plan will be approved by the court if it is deemed
to be “fair and equitable” to the dissenting parties. This procedure, in which the
court mandates a reorganization plan in spite of dissent, is called a cramdown,
because the court crams the plan down the throats of the dissenters. The ability of
the court to force acceptance of a reorganization plan greatly reduces the incentive
for creditors to hold out. Thus, in our example, if the reorganization plan offered
each creditor a new claim worth $850,000 in face value along with information that
each creditor would probably receive only $700,000 under the liquidation alternative,
then reorganization would have a good chance of success.
It is easier for a firm with few creditors to reorganize informally than it is for a
firm with many creditors. A 1990 study examined 169 publicly traded firms that
experienced severe financial distress from 1978 to 1987.6 About half of the firms
5The bankruptcy code requires that all transactions undertaken by the firm in the 6 months prior to a
bankruptcy filing be reviewed by the court for fraudulent conveyance, and the review can go back as far
as 3 years.

Private Reorganization of Firms in Default,” Journal of Financial Economics, October 1990, pp. 315–354.
Chapter 22: Bankruptcy, Reorganization, and Liquidation
877

reorganized without filing for bankruptcy, while the other half were forced to
reorganize in bankruptcy. The firms that reorganized without filing for bank-
ruptcy owed most of their debt to a few banks and had fewer creditors. Gener-
ally, bank debt can be reorganized outside of bankruptcy, but a publicly traded
bond issue held by thousands of individual bondholders makes reorganization
difficult.
Filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 has several other features that help the
bankrupt firm.
1. Interest and principal payments, including interest on delayed payments,
may be delayed without penalty until a reorganization plan is approved, and
the plan itself may call for even further delays. This permits cash generated
from operations to be used to sustain operations rather than be paid to
creditors.
2. The firm is permitted to issue debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing. DIP
financing enhances the ability of the firm to borrow funds for short-term liquidity
purposes, because such loans are, under the law, senior to all previous unsecured
debt.
3. The debtor firm’s managers are given the exclusive right for 120 days after filing
for bankruptcy protection to submit a reorganization plan, plus another 60 days
to obtain agreement on the plan from the affected parties. The court may also
extend these dates up to 18 months. After management’s first right to submit a
plan has expired, any party to the proceedings may propose its own reorganiza-
tion plan.
Under the early bankruptcy laws, most formal reorganization plans were guided
by the absolute priority doctrine.7 This doctrine holds that creditors should
be compensated for their claims in a rigid hierarchical order and that senior claims
must be paid in full before junior claims can receive even a dime. If there were
any chance that a delay would lead to losses by senior creditors, then the
firm would be shut down and liquidated. However, an alternative position, the rel-
ative priority doctrine, holds that more flexibility should be allowed in a reorga-
nization and that a balanced consideration should be given to all claimants.
The current law represents a movement away from absolute priority toward
relative priority.
The primary role of the bankruptcy court in a reorganization is to determine the
fairness and the feasibility of the proposed plan of reorganization. The basic doc-
trine of fairness states that claims must be recognized in the order of their legal and
contractual priority. Feasibility means that there is a reasonable chance that the reor-
ganized company will be viable. Carrying out the concepts of fairness and feasibility
in a reorganization involves the following steps.
1. Future sales must be estimated.
2. Operating conditions must be analyzed so that future earnings and cash flows can
be predicted.
3. The appropriate capitalization rate must be determined.
7For more on absolute priority, see Lawrence A. Weiss, “The Bankruptcy Code and Violations of Abso-
lute Priority,” Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, Summer 1991, pp. 71–78; William Beranek, Robert
Boehmer, and Brooke Smith, “Much Ado about Nothing: Absolute Priority Deviations in Chapter 11,”
Financial Management, Autumn 1996, pp. 102–109; and Allan C. Eberhart, William T. Moore, and
Rodney Roenfeldt, “Security Pricing and Deviations from the Absolute Priority Rule in Bankruptcy
Proceedings,” Journal of Finance, December 1990, pp. 1457–1469.

Part 9: Special Topics

4. This capitalization rate must then be applied to the estimated cash flows to obtain
an estimate of the company’s value.8
5. An appropriate capital structure for the company after it emerges from
Chapter 11 must be determined.
6. The reorganized firm’s securities must be allocated to the various claimants in a
fair and equitable manner.
The primary test of feasibility in a reorganization is whether the fixed charges
after reorganization will be adequately covered by earnings. Adequate coverage gen-
erally requires an improvement in earnings, a reduction of fixed charges, or both.
Among the actions that must generally be taken are the following.
1. Debt maturities are usually lengthened, interest rates may be lowered, and some
debt is usually converted into equity.
2. When the quality of management has been substandard, a new team must be
given control of the company.
3. If inventories have become obsolete or depleted, they must be replaced.
4. Sometimes the plant and equipment must be modernized before the firm can
operate and compete successfully.
5. Reorganization may also require an improvement in production, marketing, ad-
vertising, and/or other functions.
6. It is sometimes necessary to develop new products or markets to enable the firm
to move from areas where economic trends are poor into areas with more poten-
tial for growth.
7. Labor unions must agree to accept lower wages and less restrictive work rules.
This was a major issue for United Airlines in 2003 as it attempted to emerge
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. By threatening liquidation, UAL
was able to squeeze a $6.6 billion reduction in payroll costs from its pilots
over 6 years and another $2.6 billion from its ground-crew workers. This
wasn’t enough, though, and UAL didn’t emerge from bankruptcy for another
3 years.
These actions usually require at least some new money, so most reorganization plans
include new investors who are willing to put up new capital.
It might appear that stockholders have very little to say in a bankruptcy situa-
tion in which the firm’s assets are worth less than the face value of its debt.
Under the absolute priority rule, stockholders in such a situation should get
nothing of value under a reorganization plan. In fact, however, stockholders
may be able to extract some of the firm’s value. This occurs because (1) stock-
holders generally continue to control the firm during the bankruptcy proceed-
ings, (2) stockholders have the first right (after management’s 120-day window)
to file a reorganization plan, and (3) for the creditors, developing a plan and tak-
ing it through the courts would be expensive and time-consuming. Given this
situation, creditors may support a plan under which they are not paid off in full
and where the old stockholders will control the reorganized company, just be-
cause the creditors want to get the problem behind them and to get some money
in the near future.
8Several different approaches can be used to estimate a company’s value. Market-determined multiples
such as the price/earnings ratio, which are obtained from an analysis of comparable firms, can be applied
to some measure of the company’s earnings or cash flow. Alternatively, discounted cash flow techniques
may be used. The key point here is that fairness requires the value of a company facing reorganization to
be estimated so that potential offers can be evaluated rationally by the bankruptcy court.

Illustration of a Reorganization
Reorganization procedures may be illustrated with an example involving the Colum-
bia Software Company, a regional firm that specializes in selling, installing, and ser-
vicing accounting software for small businesses.9 Table 22-2 gives Columbia’s
balance sheet as of March 31, 2010. The company had been suffering losses running
to $2.5 million a year, and (as the following discussion will make clear) the asset
values in the balance sheet are overstated relative to their market values. The firm
was insolvent, which means that the book values of its liabilities were greater than
the market values of its assets, so it filed a petition with a federal court for reorgani-
zation under Chapter 11. Management filed a plan of reorganization with the court
on June 13, 2010. The plan was subsequently submitted for review by the SEC.10
The plan concluded that the company could not be internally reorganized and
that the only feasible solution would be to combine Columbia with a larger, nation-
wide software company. Accordingly, management solicited the interest of a number
of software companies. Late in July 2010, Moreland Software showed an interest in
Columbia. On August 3, 2010, Moreland made a formal proposal to take over
Columbia’s $6 million of 7.5% first-mortgage bonds, to pay the $250,000 in taxes
owed by Columbia, and to provide 40,000 shares of Moreland common stock to
satisfy the remaining creditor claims. Since the Moreland stock had a market price
of $75 per share, the value of the stock was $3 million. Thus, Moreland was offering

setting or involve issues of national interest.

$3 million of stock plus assuming $6 million of loans and $250,000 of taxes—a total
of $9.25 million for assets that had a book value of $16.7 million.
Moreland’s plan is shown in Table 22-3. As in most Chapter 11 plans, the secured
creditors’ claims are paid in full (in this case, the mortgage bonds are taken over by
Moreland Software). However, the total remaining unsecured claims equal $10 mil-
lion against only $3 million of Moreland stock. Thus, each unsecured creditor would
be entitled to receive 30% before the adjustment for subordination. Before this ad-
justment, holders of the notes payable would receive 30% of their $250,000 claim,
or $75,000 in stock. However, the debentures are subordinated to the notes payable,
so an additional $175,000 must be allocated to notes payable (see footnote a in Table
22-3). In Column 5, the dollar claims of each class of debt are restated in terms of the
number of shares of Moreland common stock received by each class of unsecured
creditors. Finally, Column 6 shows the percentage of the original claim that each
group received. Of course, both the taxes and the secured creditors were paid off in
full, while the stockholders received nothing.11
The bankruptcy court first evaluated the proposal from the standpoint of fairness. The
court began by considering the value of Columbia Software as estimated by the unsecured
creditors’ committee and by a subgroup of debenture holders. After discussions with vari-
ous experts, one group had arrived at estimated post-reorganization sales of $25 million
per year. It further estimated that the profit margin on sales would equal 6%, thus produc-
ing estimated future annual earnings of $1.5 million.
This subgroup analyzed price/earnings ratios for comparable companies and
arrived at 8 times future earnings for a capitalization factor. Multiplying 8 by $1.5

11We do not show it, but $365,000 of fees for Columbia’s attorneys and $123,000 of fees for the cred-
itors’ committee lawyers were also deducted. The current assets shown in Table 22-2 were net of these
fees. Creditors joke (often bitterly) about the “lawyers first” rule in payouts in bankruptcy cases. It is often
said, with much truth, that the only winners in bankruptcy cases are the attorneys.
Chapter 22: Bankruptcy, Reorganization, and Liquidation

million gave an indicated equity value of the company of $12 million. This value was
4 times that of the 40,000 shares of Moreland stock offered for the remainder of the
company. Thus, the subgroup concluded that the plan for reorganization did not
meet the test of fairness. Note that, under both Moreland’s plan and the subgroup’s
plan, the holders of common stock were to receive nothing, which is one of the risks
of ownership, while the holders of the first-mortgage bonds were to be assumed by
Moreland, which amounts to being paid in full.
The bankruptcy judge examined management’s plan for feasibility, observing that
in the reorganization Moreland Software would take over Columbia’s properties.
The court judged that the direction and aid of Moreland would remedy the deficien-
cies that had troubled Columbia. Whereas the debt/assets ratio of Columbia Software
had become unbalanced, Moreland had only a moderate amount of debt. After con-
solidation, Moreland would still have a relatively low 27% debt ratio.
Moreland’s net income before interest and taxes had been running at a level of
approximately $15 million. The interest on its long-term debt after the merger would
be $1.5 million and, taking short-term borrowings into account, would total a maxi-
mum of $2 million per year. The $15 million in earnings before interest and taxes
would therefore provide an interest charge coverage of 7.5 times, exceeding the
norm of 5 times for the industry.
Note that the question of feasibility would have been irrelevant if Moreland had
offered $3 million in cash (rather than in stock) and payment of the bonds (rather
than assuming them). It is the court’s responsibility to protect the interests of
Columbia’s creditors. Because the creditors are being forced to take common stock
or bonds guaranteed by another firm, the law requires the court to look into the
feasibility of the transaction. However, if Moreland had made a cash offer, then the
feasibility of its own operation after the transaction would not have been a concern.
Moreland Software was told of the subgroup’s analysis and concern over the fair-
ness of the plan. Further, Moreland was asked to increase the number of shares it
offered. Moreland refused, and no other company offered to acquire Columbia. Be-
cause no better offer could be obtained and since the only alternative to the plan was
liquidation (with an even lower realized value), Moreland’s proposal was ultimately
accepted by the creditors despite some disagreement with the valuation.
One interesting aspect of this case concerned an agency conflict between
Columbia’s old stockholders and its management. Columbia’s management knew
when it filed for bankruptcy that the company was probably worth less than the
amount of its debt and hence that stockholders would probably receive nothing. In-
deed, that situation did materialize. If management has a primary responsibility to the
stockholders, then why would it file for bankruptcy knowing that the stockholders
would receive nothing? In the first place, management did not know for certain that
stockholders would receive nothing. But they were certain that, if they did not file for
bankruptcy protection, then creditors would foreclose on the company’s property and
shut the company down, which would surely lead to liquidation and a total loss to
stockholders. Second, if the company were liquidated, then managers and workers
would lose their jobs and the managers would have a black mark on their records.
Finally, Columbia’s managers thought (correctly) that there was nothing they could
do to protect the stockholders, so they might as well do what was best for the work-
force, the creditors, and themselves—and that meant realizing the most value possi-
ble for the company’s assets.
Some of the stockholders felt betrayed by management—they thought management
should have taken more heroic steps to protect them, regardless of the cost to other
parties. One stockholder suggested management should have sold off assets, taken the
882
Part 9: Special Topics

cash to Las Vegas, and rolled the dice. Then, if they won, they should have paid off the
debt and had something left for stockholders, leaving debtholders holding the bag if they
lost. Actually, management had done something a bit like this in the year preceding the
bankruptcy. Management realized the company was floundering, was likely to sink under
its current operating plan, and that only a “big winner” project would save the company.
Hence they took on several risky, “bet the company” projects with negative expected
NPVs but at least some chance for high profits. Unfortunately, those projects did not
work out.
Prepackaged Bankruptcies
In recent years, a new type of reorganization that combines the advantages of both
the informal workout and formal Chapter 11 reorganization has become popular.
This hybrid is called a prepackaged bankruptcy, or pre-pack.12
In an informal workout, a debtor negotiates a restructuring with its creditors.
Even though complex workouts typically involve corporate officers, lenders, lawyers,
and investment bankers, workouts are still less expensive and less damaging to repu-
tations than are Chapter 11 reorganizations. In a prepackaged bankruptcy, the debtor
firm gets all, or most, of the creditors to agree to the reorganization plan prior to
filing for bankruptcy. Then, a reorganization plan is filed along with, or shortly after,
the bankruptcy petition. If enough creditors have signed on before the filing, a cram-
down can be used to bring reluctant creditors along.
A logical question arises: Why would a firm that can arrange an informal reorga-
nization want to file for bankruptcy? The three primary advantages of a prepackaged
bankruptcy are (1) reduction of the holdout problem, (2) preserving creditors’ claims,
and (3) taxes. Perhaps the biggest benefit of a prepackaged bankruptcy is the reduc-
tion of the holdout problem, because a bankruptcy filing permits a cramdown that
would otherwise be impossible. By eliminating holdouts, bankruptcy forces all cred-
itors in each class to participate on a pro rata basis, which preserves the relative value
of all claimants. Also, filing for formal bankruptcy can at times have positive tax im-
plications. First, in an informal reorganization in which the debtholders trade debt
for equity, if the original equity holders end up with less than 50% ownership then
the company loses its accumulated tax losses. In formal bankruptcy, in contrast, the
firm may get to keep its loss carryforwards. Second, in a workout, when (say) debt
worth $1,000 is exchanged for debt worth $500, the reduction in debt of $500 is con-
sidered to be taxable income to the corporation. However, if this same situation occurs
in a Chapter 11 reorganization, the difference is not treated as taxable income.13
All in all, prepackaged bankruptcies make sense in many situations. If sufficient agree-
ment can be reached among creditors through informal negotiations, a subsequent filing
can solve the holdout problem and result in favorable tax treatment. For these reasons,
the number of prepackaged bankruptcies has grown dramatically in recent years.
12For more information on prepackaged bankruptcies, see John J. McConnell and Henri Servaes,
“The Economics of Pre-Packaged Bankruptcy,” Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, Summer 1991,
pp. 93–97; Brian L. Betker, “An Empirical Examination of Prepackaged Bankruptcy,” Financial Manage-
ment, Spring 1995, pp. 3–18; Sris Chatterjee, Upinder S. Dhillon, and Gabriel G. Ramirez, “Resolution

13Note that in both tax situations—loss carryforwards and debt value reductions—favorable tax treatment
can be available in workouts if the firm is deemed to be legally insolvent—that is, if the market value of its
assets is demonstrated to be less than the face value of its liabilities.

Reorganization Time and Expense
The time, expense, and headaches involved in a reorganization are almost beyond
comprehension. Even in $2- to $3-million bankruptcies, many people and groups
are involved: lawyers representing the company, the U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee, each
class of secured creditor, the general creditors as a group, tax authorities, and the
stockholders if they are upset with management. There are time limits within which
things are supposed to be done, but the process generally takes at least a year and
usually much longer. The company must be given time to file its plan, and creditor
groups must be given time to study and seek clarifications to it and then file counter-
plans, to which the company must respond. Also, different creditor classes often
disagree among themselves as to how much each class should receive, and hearings
must be held to resolve such conflicts.
Management will want to remain in business, whereas some well-secured creditors
may want the company liquidated as quickly as possible. Often, some party’s plan will
involve selling the business to another concern, as was the case with Columbia Soft-
ware in our earlier example. Obviously, it can take months to seek out and negotiate
with potential merger candidates.
The typical bankruptcy case takes about 2 years from the time the company files
for protection under Chapter 11 until the final reorganization plan is approved or
rejected. While all of this is going on, the company’s business suffers. Sales certainly
won’t be helped, key employees may leave, and the remaining employees will be wor-
rying about their jobs rather than concentrating on their work. Further, management
will be spending much of its time on the bankruptcy rather than running the busi-
ness, and it won’t be able to take any significant action without court approval, which
requires filing a formal petition with the court and giving all parties involved a
chance to respond.
Even if its operations do not suffer, the company’s assets surely will be reduced by
its own legal fees and the required court and trustee costs. Good bankruptcy lawyers
charge from $200 to $400 or more per hour, depending on the location, so those
costs are not trivial. The creditors also will be incurring legal costs. Indeed, the
sound of all of those meters ticking at $200 or so an hour in a slow-moving hearing
can be deafening.
Note that creditors also lose the time value of their money. A creditor with a
$100,000 claim and a 10% opportunity cost who ends up getting $50,000 after 2 years
would have been better off settling for $41,500 initially. When the creditor’s legal
fees, executive time, and general aggravation are taken into account, it might make
sense to settle for $25,000 or even $20,000.
Both the troubled company and its creditors know the drawbacks of formal bank-
ruptcy, or their lawyers will inform them. Armed with knowledge of how bankruptcy
works, management may be in a strong position to persuade creditors to accept
a workout that may seem to be unfair and unreasonable. Or, if a Chapter 11
case has already begun, creditors may at some point agree to settle just to stop
the bleeding.
One final point should be made before closing this section. In most reorganization
plans, creditors with claims of less than $1,000 are paid off in full. Paying off these
“nuisance claims” does not cost much money, and it saves time and gets votes to
support the plan.14

ruptcy Costs: Evidence from the Trucking Industry,” The Financial Review, May 1991, pp. 223–235.

22.6 LIQUIDATION IN BANKRUPTCY
If a company is “too far gone” to be reorganized, then it must be liquidated. Liqui-
dation should occur when the business is worth more dead than alive, or when the
possibility of restoring it to financial health is remote and the creditors are exposed
to a high risk of greater loss if operations are continued. Earlier we discussed as-
signment, which is an informal liquidation procedure. Now we consider liquida-
tion in bankruptcy, which is carried out under the jurisdiction of a federal
bankruptcy court.
Chapter 7 of the Federal Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 deals with liquidation. It
(1) provides safeguards against fraud by the debtor, (2) provides for an equitable dis-
tribution of the debtor’s assets among the creditors, and (3) allows insolvent debtors
to discharge all their obligations and thus be able to start new businesses unhampered
by the burdens of prior debt. However, formal liquidation is time-consuming and
costly, and it extinguishes the business.
The distribution of assets in a liquidation under Chapter 7 is governed by the fol-
lowing priority of claims.
1. Past-due property taxes.
2. Secured creditors, who are entitled to the proceeds of the sale of specific property pledged
for a lien or a mortgage. If the proceeds from the sale of the pledged property do
not fully satisfy a secured creditor’s claim, the remaining balance is treated as a
general creditor claim (see Item 10 below).15
3. Legal fees and other expenses to administer and operate the bankrupt firm. These costs
include legal fees incurred in trying to reorganize.
4. Expenses incurred after an involuntary case has begun but before a trustee is appointed.
5. Wages due workers if earned within 3 months prior to the filing of the petition for
bankruptcy. The amount of wages is limited to $2,000 per employee.
6. Claims for unpaid contributions to employee pension plans that should have been paid
within 6 months prior to filing. These claims, plus wages in Item 5, may not exceed
the limit of $2,000 per wage earner.
7. Unsecured claims for customer deposits. These claims are limited to a maximum of
$900 per individual.
8. Taxes due to federal, state, county, and other government agencies.
15When a firm or individual who goes bankrupt has a bank loan, the bank will attach any deposit bal-
ances. The loan agreement may stipulate that the bank has a first-priority claim on any deposits. If so,
then the deposits are used to offset all or part of the bank loan—in legal terms, “the right of offset.” In
this case, the bank will not have to share the deposits with other creditors. Loan contracts often designate
compensating balances as security against a loan. Even if the bank has no explicit claim against deposits,
the bank will attach the deposits and hold them for the general body of creditors, including the bank it-
self. Without an explicit statement in the loan agreement, the bank does not receive preferential treatment
with regard to attached deposits.
Chapter 22: Bankruptcy, Reorganization, and Liquidation
885

9. Unfunded pension plan liabilities. These liabilities have a claim above that of the
general creditors for an amount up to 30% of the common and preferred equity,
and any remaining unfunded pension claims rank with the general creditors.16
10. General, or unsecured, creditors. Holders of trade credit, unsecured loans, the un-
satisfied portion of secured loans, and debenture bonds are classified as general
creditors. Holders of subordinated debt also fall into this category, but they
must turn over required amounts to the senior debt.
11. Preferred stockholders. These stockholders can receive an amount up to the par
value of their stock.
12. Common stockholders. These stockholders receive any remaining funds.17
To illustrate how this priority system works, consider the balance sheet of Whitman
Inc., shown in Table 22-4. Assets have a book value of $90 million. The claims are shown

16Pension plan liabilities have a significant bearing on bankruptcy settlements. As we discuss in
Web Chapter 29, pension plans may be funded or unfunded. With a funded plan, the firm makes cash
payments to an insurance company or to a trustee (generally a bank), which then uses these funds (and
the interest earned on them) to pay retirees’ pensions. With an unfunded plan, the firm is obligated to
make payments to retirees, but it does not provide cash in advance. Many plans are actually partially
funded—some money has been paid in advance but not enough to provide full pension benefits to all
employees.
If a firm goes bankrupt, the funded part of the pension plan remains intact and is available for retirees.
Prior to 1974, employees had no explicit claims for unfunded pension liabilities, but under the Employees’
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), an amount up to 30% of the equity (common and
preferred) is earmarked for employees’ pension plans and has a priority over the general creditors, with
any remaining pension claims having status equal to that of the general creditors. This means, in effect,
that the funded portion of a bankrupt firm’s pension plan is completely secured whereas the unfunded
portion ranks just above the general creditors. Obviously, unfunded pension liabilities should be of great
concern to a firm’s unsecured creditors.
17Note that if different classes of common stock have been issued, then differential priorities may exist in
stockholder claims.

on the right-hand side of the balance sheet. Note that the debentures are subordinated to
the notes payable to banks. Whitman filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11, but since
no fair and feasible reorganization could be arranged, the trustee is liquidating the firm
under Chapter 7.
The assets as reported in the balance sheet are greatly overstated; they are, in fact,
worth less than half the $90 million that is shown. The following amounts are
realized on liquidation:
From sale of current assets

The distribution of proceeds from the liquidation is shown in Table 22-5. The

property, leaving $28 million available to the remaining creditors, including a $1
million unsatisfied claim of the first-mortgage holders. Next are the fees and

aColumn 2 is the claim of each class of general creditor. Total claims equal $40.0 million.
bFrom the top section of the table, we see that $20 million is available for distribution to general creditors. Since there is
$40 million worth of general creditor claims, the pro rata distribution will be $20/$40 = 0.50, or 50 cents on the dollar.
cThe debentures are subordinate to the notes payable, so up to $5 million could be reallocated from debentures to notes
payable. However, only $4 million is available to the debentures, so this entire amount is reallocated.
dColumn 5 shows the results of dividing the Column 4 final allocation by the original claim shown in Column 2—except for
the first mortgage, where the $5 million received from the sale of fixed assets is included in the calculation.
Chapter 22: Bankruptcy, Reorganization, and Liquidation

proceeds (including the bankrupt firm’s own legal fees); in this example, they are as-
sumed to be $6 million. Next in priority are wages due workers, which total
$700,000, and taxes due, which amount to $1.3 million. Thus far, the total amount
of claims paid from the $33 million received from the asset sale is $13 million, leav-
ing $20 million for the general creditors. In this example, we assume there are no
claims for unpaid benefit plans or unfunded pension liabilities.
The claims of the general creditors total $40 million. Since $20 million is
available, claimants will be allocated 50% of their claims initially, as shown in
Column 3. However, the subordination adjustment requires that the subordinated
debentures turn over to the notes payable all amounts received until the notes are
satisfied. In this situation, the claim of the notes payable is $10 million but only $5
million is available; the deficiency is therefore $5 million. After transfer of $4 million
from the subordinated debentures, there remains a deficiency of $1 million on the
notes; this amount will remain unsatisfied.
Note that 90% of the bank claim is satisfied, whereas a maximum of 50%
of other unsecured claims will be satisfied. These figures illustrate the usefulness
of the subordination provision to the security to which the subordination
is made.
Because no other funds remain, the claims of the holders of preferred and com-
mon stocks, as well as the subordinated debentures, are completely wiped out. Stud-
ies of the proceeds in bankruptcy liquidations reveal that unsecured creditors receive,
on the average, about 15 cents on the dollar, while common stockholders generally
receive nothing.
A Nation of Defaulters?
Big corporate bankruptcies like those of Lehman Broth-
ers and General Motors get the headlines, but they rep-
resent a small portion of the many bankruptcies each
year, as shown in the accompanying table. Most busi-
ness bankruptcies are liquidations of small businesses,
and they have been rising steadily since 2006. Although
there are fewer business reorganizations than liquida-
tions, reorganizations also have increased steadily
since 2006.
Personal bankruptcies can be liquidations (Chapter 7)
or reorganizations (Chapter 13). In a Chapter 7 bank-
ruptcy, an individual can keep a small amount of exempt
personal property, and the nonexempt property is sold to
satisfy creditors. In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, an individual
is allowed to keep nonexempt personal property but typi-
cally must repay the debt within 3 to 5 years. A change in
bankruptcy laws in 2005 made it more difficult for indivi-
duals to declare bankruptcy, but there has been dramatic
increase in personal bankruptcies since 2006, with liqui-
dations leading the way.
Napoleon Bonaparte reputedly scorned England as
“a nation of shopkeepers.” If he had been able to see
current U.S. bankruptcy statistics, would he have called
modern America “a nation of defaulters”?

22.7 OTHER MOTIVATIONS FOR BANKRUPTCY
Normally, bankruptcy proceedings do not commence until a company has become so
financially weak that it cannot meet its current obligations. However, bankruptcy law
also permits a company to file for bankruptcy if its financial forecasts indicate that a
continuation of current conditions would lead to insolvency.
Bankruptcy law has also been used to hasten settlements in major product liability
suits. The Manville asbestos case is an example. The company was being bombarded
by thousands of lawsuits, and the very existence of such huge contingent liabilities
made normal operations impossible. Further, it was relatively easy to prove (1) that
if the plaintiffs won, the company would be unable to pay the full amount of the
claims, (2) that a larger amount of funds would be available to the claimants if the
company continued to operate rather than liquidate, (3) that continued operations
were possible only if the suits were brought to a conclusion, and (4) that a timely
resolution of all the suits was impossible because of their vast number and variety.
Manville filed for bankruptcy in 1982, at that time the largest U.S. bankruptcy ever.
The bankruptcy statutes were used to consolidate all the suits and to reach settle-
ments under which the plaintiffs obtained more money than they otherwise would
have received, and Manville was able to stay in business. (It was acquired in 2001 by
Berkshire Hathaway.) The stockholders did poorly under these plans because most of
the companies’ future cash flows were assigned to the plaintiffs, but even so, the
stockholders probably fared better than they would have if the suits had been con-
cluded through the jury system.

22.8 SOME CRITICISMS OF BANKRUPTCY LAWS
Although bankruptcy laws, for the most part, exist to protect creditors, many critics
claim that current laws are not doing what they were intended to do. Before 1978,
most bankruptcies ended quickly in liquidation. Then Congress rewrote the laws,
giving companies more opportunity to stay alive on the grounds that this was best
for managers, employees, creditors, and stockholders. Before the reform, 90% of
Chapter 11 filers were liquidated, but now that percentage is less than 80%, and the
average time between filing and liquidation has almost doubled. Indeed, large public
corporations with the ability to hire high-priced legal help can avoid (or at least
delay) liquidation, often at the expense of creditors and shareholders.
Critics believe that bankruptcy is great for businesses these days—especially for
consultants, lawyers, and investment bankers, who reap hefty fees during bankruptcy
proceedings, and for managers, who continue to collect their salaries and bonuses as
long as the business is kept alive. The problem, according to critics, is that bank-
ruptcy courts allow cases to drag on too long, depleting assets that could be sold to
pay off creditors and shareholders. Too often, quick resolution is impossible because
bankruptcy judges are required to deal with issues such as labor disputes, pension
Chapter 22: Bankruptcy, Reorganization, and Liquidation
889

plan funding, and environmental liability—social questions that could be solved by
legislative action rather than by bankruptcy courts.
Critics contend that bankruptcy judges ought to realize that some sick companies
should be allowed to die—and die quickly. Maintaining companies on life support
does not serve the interests of the parties that the bankruptcy laws were designed to
protect. The 2005 changes to the bankruptcy code addressed this issue by limiting to
18 months the time that management has to file a reorganization plan. Prior to the
change, judges could extend this time almost indefinitely. Now, creditors may
propose a plan if an acceptable plan hasn’t been filed by management within
18 months.
Other critics think the entire bankruptcy system of judicial protection and super-
vision needs to be scrapped. Some even have proposed a kind of auction procedure,
where shareholders and creditors would have the opportunity to gain control of a
bankrupt company by raising the cash needed to pay the bills. The rationale here is
that the market is a better judge than a bankruptcy court as to whether a company is
worth more dead or alive.
Self-Test
According to critics, what are some problems with the bankruptcy system?
Summary
This chapter discussed the main issues involved in bankruptcy and financial distress
in general. The key concepts are listed below.
•
The fundamental issue that must be addressed when a company encounters
financial distress is whether it is “worth more dead than alive”; that is, would the
business be more valuable if it continued in operation or if it were liquidated and
sold off in pieces?
•
In the case of a fundamentally sound company whose financial difficulties appear
to be temporary, creditors will frequently work directly with the company, help-
ing it to recover and reestablish itself on a sound financial basis. Such voluntary
reorganization plans are called workouts.
•
Reorganization plans usually require some type of restructuring of the firm’s
debts; this may involve an extension, which postpones the date of required
payment of past-due obligations, and/or a composition, by which the creditors
voluntarily reduce their claims on the debtor or the interest rate on their claims.
•
When it is obvious that a firm is worth more dead than alive, informal proce-
dures can sometimes be used to liquidate the firm. Assignment is an informal
procedure for liquidating a firm, and it usually yields creditors a larger amount
than they would receive in a formal bankruptcy liquidation. However, assign-
ments are feasible only if the firm is small and its affairs are not too complex.
•
Current bankruptcy law consists of nine chapters, designated by Arabic
numbers. For businesses, the most important chapters are Chapter 7, which
details the procedures to be followed when liquidating a firm, and Chapter 11,
which contains procedures for formal reorganizations.
•
Since the first bankruptcy laws, most formal reorganization plans have been
guided by the absolute priority doctrine. This doctrine holds that creditors
should be compensated for their claims in a rigid hierarchical order and that
senior claims must be paid in full before junior claims can receive even a dime.
•
Another position, the relative priority doctrine, holds that more flexibility
should be allowed in a reorganization and that a balanced consideration should
890
Part 9: Special Topics

be given to all claimants. In recent years, there has been a shift away from abso-
lute priority toward relative priority. The primary effect of this shift has been to
delay liquidations, giving managements more time to rehabilitate companies in
an effort to provide value to junior claimants.
•
The primary role of the bankruptcy court in a reorganization is to determine the
fairness and the feasibility of proposed plans of reorganization.
•
Even if some creditors or stockholders dissent and do not accept a reorganization
plan, the plan may still be approved by the court if the plan is deemed to be “fair
and equitable” to all parties. This procedure, in which the court mandates a
reorganization plan in spite of dissent, is called a cramdown.
•
In the last few years, a new type of reorganization that combines the advantages
of both the informal workout and formal Chapter 11 reorganization has become
popular. This new hybrid is called a prepackaged bankruptcy, or pre-pack.
•
The distribution of assets in a liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy
Act is governed by a specific priority of claims.
•
Multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) is a method to identify firms with high
bankruptcy risk. We discuss MDA in Web Extension 22A.

Liquidation
At the time it defaulted on its interest payments and filed for bankruptcy, Medford
Fabricators Inc. had the following balance sheet (in millions of dollars). The court, after
trying unsuccessfully to reorganize the firm, decided that the only recourse was liquida-
tion under Chapter 7. Sale of the fixed assets, which were pledged as collateral to the
mortgage bondholders, brought in $750 million, while the current assets were sold for
another $400 million. Thus, the total proceeds from the liquidation sale were $1,150
million. The trustee’s costs amounted to $1 million; no single worker was due more
than $2,000 in wages; and there were no unfunded pension plan liabilities.

Liquidation
At the time it defaulted on its interest payments and filed for bankruptcy, the McDaniel
Mining Company had the balance sheet shown below (in thousands of dollars). The
court, after trying unsuccessfully to reorganize the firm, decided that the only recourse
was liquidation under Chapter 7. Sale of the fixed assets, which were pledged as collateral
to the mortgage bondholders, brought in $400,000, while the current assets were sold for
another $200,000. Thus, the total proceeds from the liquidation sale were $600,000. The
trustee’s costs amounted to $50,000; no single worker was due more than $2,000 in
wages; and there were no unfunded pension plan liabilities.

Mini Case
Kimberly MacKenzie—president of Kim’s Clothes Inc., a medium-sized manufacturer of
women’s casual clothing—is worried. Her firm has been selling clothes to Russ Brothers
Department Store for more than 10 years, and she has never experienced any problems in
collecting payment for the merchandise sold. Currently, Russ Brothers owes Kim’s Clothes
$65,000 for spring sportswear that was delivered to the store just 2 weeks ago. Kim’s concern
arose from reading an article in yesterday’s The Wall Street Journal that indicated Russ
Brothers was having serious financial problems. Moreover, the article stated that Russ
Brothers’s management was considering filing for reorganization, or even liquidation, with a
federal bankruptcy court.

Kim’s immediate concern was whether or not her firm would collect its receivables if Russ Broth-
ers went bankrupt. In pondering the situation, Kim also realized that she knew nothing about the pro-
cess that firms go through when they encounter severe financial distress. To learn more about
bankruptcy, reorganization, and liquidation, Kim asked Ron Mitchell, the firm’s chief financial officer,
to prepare a briefing on the subject for the entire board of directors. In turn, Ron asked you, a newly
hired financial analyst, to do the groundwork for the briefing by answering the following questions.
a. (1) What are the major causes of business failure?
(2) Do business failures occur evenly over time?
(3) Which size of firm, large or small, is more prone to business failure? Why?
b. What key issues must managers face in the financial distress process?
c. What informal remedies are available to firms in financial distress? In answering this
question, define the following terms:
(1)

K
och Industries is an extremely well-diversified company, with lines of
business in refining, chemicals, pollution control equipment, minerals,
fibers (including COOLMAX), consumer products (like Brawny paper
towels and Dixie cups), and even ranching. It is a large company, too,
with analysts estimating that Koch’s value of over $100 billion makes it
one of the largest privately held companies in the United States. You
might think such a large and well-diversified company wouldn’t need to
worry about risk management, but that’s not the case. Koch employs
state-of-the-art risk management software to monitor its exposure to
dozens of risks, including commodity prices and foreign currency. The
system also allows employees to conduct “what if” analyses of their
business plans to estimate how changes in inputs will affect cash flows.
Before Bill Caton became chief risk officer at Navistar, each business unit
tried to manage its own risk. Not surprisingly, many of these units based their
forecasts on very different assumptions about the economic outlook, with
some overly optimistic forecasts leading to excess inventory and losses
at several business units. Now Navistar uses an enterprise resource
management (ERM) system and monthly meetings of business unit heads
to ensure that realistic assumptions are used throughout the company. The
monthly meetings also help Navistar identify and control many of its risks.
In addition to managing their own risks, many companies monitor
counterparty risk, which is the danger that another company might not
fulfill its obligations. For example, Navistar implemented a system to
monitor its suppliers and was able to avoid a business interruption by
switching from an at-risk supplier just before the supplier failed. Pepsi
Bottling Group’s CFO, Al Drewes, says that they monitor “more than
100 risks worldwide, across strategy, operations, financial, corporate
compliance, control, and the like.” After Pepsi lost a $100 million line of
credit when Lehman Brothers failed, Pepsi now monitors the counterparty
risk posed by the banks that guarantee its lines of credit.
Think about the ways that Koch, Navistar, and Pepsi manage their risks
as you read the chapter.

In this chapter we discuss risk management, an important topic for financial managers.
The term risk management can mean many things, but in business it involves identifying
events that could have adverse financial consequences and then taking actions to
prevent or minimize the damage caused by these events. Years ago, corporate risk
managers dealt primarily with insurance—they made sure the firm was adequately
insured against fire, theft, and other casualties and also that it had adequate liability
coverage. More recently, the scope of risk management has been broadened to include
controlling the costs of key inputs like petroleum by purchasing oil futures as well
as protecting against changes in interest rates or exchange rates through transactions in
the interest rate or foreign exchange markets. In addition, risk managers try to ensure
that actions intended to hedge against risk are not actually increasing risks.
Also, since the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, insurance against terrorist attacks has become a major issue. Unless possible
terrorist targets—including large malls, office buildings, oil refineries, airlines, and
ships—can be insured against attacks, lenders may refuse to provide mortgage financ-
ing, and that would crimp the economy. Private insurance companies are reluctant to
insure these projects, at least without charging prohibitive premiums, so the federal
government has been asked to step in and provide terrorist insurance.1 However,
losses due to terrorist attacks are potentially so large that they could bankrupt even
strong insurance companies. Therefore, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insur-
ance Act (TRIA) in 2002 and extended it in 2007. Under the TRIA, the federal gov-
ernment and private insurers will share the cost of benefits paid on insured losses
caused by terrorists.
Corporate Valuation and Risk Management
All companies are exposed to risk from volatility in
product prices, demand, input costs, and other sources
or business risk, such as the risk stemming from the
choice of production technology. Many companies also
are exposed to risk from volatility in exchange rates and
interest rates. Risk management can reduce firm risk, pre-
venting catastrophes and leading to a lower cost of capi-
tal. In some instances, derivatives such as swaps can
actually reduce the effective interest rate paid by a corpo-
ration, again reducing its cost of capital.

Part 9: Special Topics

23.1 REASONS TO MANAGE RISK
We know investors dislike risk. We also know that most investors hold well-
diversified portfolios, so at least in theory the only “relevant risk” is systematic risk.
Therefore, if you asked corporate executives what type of risk worries them most,
you might expect their answer to be “beta.” However, this is almost certainly not
the answer you would get. If you asked a CEO to define risk, the most likely answer
would be: “Risk is the possibility that our future earnings and free cash flows will be
significantly lower than we expect.” For example, consider Plastics Inc., which man-
ufactures dashboards, interior door panels, and other plastic components used by
auto companies. Petroleum is the key feedstock for plastic and thus makes up a large
percentage of its costs. Plastics has a 3-year contract with an auto company to deliver
500,000 door panels each year at a price of $20 each. When the company recently
signed this contract, oil sold for $100 per barrel and was expected to stay at that level
for the next 3 years. If oil prices fell during this time, Plastics would have higher than
expected profits and free cash flows, but if oil prices rose, profits would fall. Since
Plastics’s value depends on its profits and free cash flows, a change in the price of
oil would cause stockholders to earn either more or less than they anticipated.
Now suppose that, shortly after signing the contract with its door panel supplier,
Plastics announces that it plans to lock in a 3-year supply of oil at a guaranteed price
of $100 per barrel and that the cost of this guarantee is zero. Would that cause its
stock price to rise? At first glance, it seems that the answer should be “yes,” but
maybe that’s not correct. Recall that the value of a stock depends on the present
value of its expected future free cash flows, discounted at the weighted average cost
of capital (WACC). Locking in the cost of oil will cause an increase in Plastics’s stock
price if and only if (1) it causes the expected future free cash flows to increase or (2) it
causes the WACC to decline.
Consider first the free cash flows. Before the announcement of guaranteed oil
costs, investors had formed an estimate of the expected future free cash flows based
on an expected oil price of $100 per barrel. Locking in the cost of oil at $100 per
barrel will lower the risk of the expected future free cash flows, but it might not
change the expected size of these cash flows because investors already expected a
price of $100 per barrel. Of course, declining cash flows can disrupt a firm’s opera-
tion and that disruption can, in turn, adversely affect cash flows.
Now what about the WACC? It will change only if locking in the cost of oil
causes a change either in the cost of debt or equity or in the target capital structure.
If the foreseeable increases in the price of oil are not enough to increase the threat of
bankruptcy, then Plastics’s cost of debt should not change and neither should its tar-
get capital structure. Regarding the cost of equity, recall from Chapter 6 that most
investors hold well-diversified portfolios, which means that the cost of equity should
depend only on systematic risk. Moreover, even though an increase in oil prices
would have a negative effect on Plastics’s stock price, it would not have a negative
effect on all stocks. Indeed, oil producers should have higher than expected returns
and stock prices. Assuming that Plastics’s investors hold well-diversified portfolios
that include stocks of oil-producing companies, we should have little reason to expect
its cost of equity to decrease. The bottom line is this: If Plastics’s expected future
cash flows and WACC will not change significantly as a consequence of eliminating
the risk of oil price increases, then neither should the value of its stock.
We discuss futures contracts and hedging in detail in the next section, but for now
let’s assume that Plastics has not locked in oil prices. Therefore, if oil prices increase,
its stock price will fall. However, if its stockholders know this, they can build
Chapter 23: Derivatives and Risk Management
901

portfolios that contain oil futures whose values will rise or fall with oil prices and thus
offset changes in the price of Plastics’s stock. By choosing the correct amount of
futures contracts, investors can thus “hedge” their portfolios and completely elimi-
nate the risk due to changes in oil prices. There will be a cost to hedging, but that
cost to large investors should be about the same as the cost to Plastics. Since stock-
holders can hedge away oil price risk themselves, why should they pay a higher price
for Plastics’s stock just because the company itself hedged away that risk?
The previous points notwithstanding, companies clearly believe that active risk man-
agement is important. A 1998 survey reported that 83% of firms with market values
greater than $1.2 billion engage in risk management, and that percentage is surely
much higher today.2 There are many reasons why companies manage their risks.
1. Debt capacity. Risk management can reduce the volatility of cash flows, which
decreases the probability of bankruptcy. As we discussed in Chapter 15, firms
with lower operating risks can use more debt, and this can lead to higher stock
prices due to the interest tax savings.
2. Maintaining the optimal capital budget over time. Recall from Chapter 15 that firms
are reluctant to raise external equity because of high flotation costs and market
pressure. This means that the capital budget must generally be financed with a
combination of debt and internally generated funds. In bad years, internal cash
flows may be too low to support the optimal capital budget, causing firms to
either slow investment below the optimal rate or else incur the high costs associ-
ated with external equity. By smoothing out the cash flows, risk management can
alleviate this problem. This issue is most relevant for firms with large growth
opportunities. A study by Professors Gerald Gay and Jouahn Nam found that
such firms do in fact use derivatives more than low-growth firms.3 Thus, main-
taining an optimal capital budget is an important determinant of firms’ risk
management practices.
3. Financial distress. The stages of financial distress can range from stockholder con-
cern and higher interest rates on debt to customer defections and bankruptcy.
Any serious level of financial distress causes a firm to have lower cash flows than
expected. Risk management can reduce the likelihood of low cash flows and
hence of financial distress.
4. Comparative advantages in hedging. Most investors cannot hedge as efficiently as a
company. First, firms generally incur lower transaction costs because of their
larger volume of hedging activities. Second, there is the problem of asymmetric
information: managers know more about the firm’s risk exposure than do outside
investors, so managers can create more effective hedges. And third, effective risk
management requires specialized skills and knowledge that firms are more likely
to have.
5. Borrowing costs. As discussed later in the chapter, firms can sometimes reduce
input costs—especially the interest rate on debt—through the use of derivative
instruments called “swaps.” Any such cost reduction adds value to the firm.
6. Tax effects. The present value of taxes paid by companies with volatile earnings
is higher than the present value of taxes paid by stable companies; this is because
of the treatment of tax credits and the rules governing corporate loss carryfor-
wards and carrybacks. Moreover, if volatile earnings cause a company to declare

902
Part 9: Special Topics

bankruptcy, then the company usually completely loses its tax loss carryforwards.
Therefore, using risk management to stabilize earnings can reduce the present
value of a company’s tax burden.
7. Compensation systems. Many compensation systems establish “floors” and “ceilings”
on bonuses and also reward managers for meeting targets. To illustrate, suppose
a firm’s compensation system calls for a manager to receive no bonus if net
income is below $1 million, a bonus of $10,000 if income is between $1 million
and $2 million, or a bonus of $20,000 if income is $2 million or more. The
manager will also receive an additional $10,000 if actual income is at least 90% of
the forecasted level, which is $1 million. Now consider the following two situa-
tions. First, if income is stable at $2 million each year then the manager receives a
$30,000 bonus each year, for a 2-year total of $60,000. However, if income is
zero the first year and $4 million the second, the manager gets no bonus the first
year and $30,000 the second, for a 2-year total of $30,000. So, even though the
company has the same total income ($4 million) over the two years, the man-
ager’s bonus is higher if earnings are stable. Therefore, even if hedging does not
add much value for stockholders, it may still benefit managers.
Perhaps the most important tool for risk management is the use of derivative
securities. The next section explains derivatives, which are securities whose values
are determined by the market price of some other asset. Derivatives include options
(which we discussed in Chapter 8), whose values depend on the price of some under-
lying asset; interest rate and exchange rate futures and swaps, whose values depend on
interest rate and exchange rate levels; and commodity futures, whose values depend
on commodity prices.

23.2 BACKGROUND ON DERIVATIVES
A historical perspective helps in understanding derivatives. One of the first formal
markets for derivatives was the futures market for wheat. Farmers were concerned
about the price they would receive for their wheat when they sold it in the fall, and
millers were concerned about the price they would have to pay. Each party soon
realized that the risks they faced could be reduced if they established a price earlier
in the year. Accordingly, mill agents began going out to the Wheat Belt with con-
tracts that called for the farmers to deliver grain at a predetermined price, and both
parties benefited from the transaction in the sense that their risks were reduced. The
farmers could concentrate on growing their crop without worrying about the price of
grain, and the millers could concentrate on their milling operations. Thus, hedging
with futures lowered aggregate risk in the economy.
These early futures dealings were between two parties who arranged transactions
between themselves. Soon, though, intermediaries came into the picture, and trading
in futures was established. The Chicago Board of Trade, founded in 1848 and now a
member of the CME Group, was an early marketplace where futures dealers helped
make a market in futures contracts. Thus, farmers could sell futures on the exchange
and millers could buy them there. This improved the efficiency and lowered the cost
of hedging operations.

site, http://www.cmegroup

mation on the operation
and history of the
exchange.
Chapter 23: Derivatives and Risk Management
903

A third group, speculators, soon entered the scene. As we see in the next section,
most derivatives—including futures—are highly leveraged, which means that a small
change in the value of the underlying asset will produce a large change in the price of
the derivative. This leverage appealed to speculators. At first blush, one might think
that the appearance of speculators would increase risk, but this is not true. Specula-
tors add capital and players to the market, which tends to stabilize the market. Of
course, derivatives markets are inherently volatile because of the leverage involved;
hence risk to the speculators themselves is high. Still, the speculators bear much of
the risk, which makes the derivatives markets more stable for hedgers.
Natural hedges, defined as situations in which aggregate risk can be reduced by
derivatives transactions between two parties (called counterparties), exist for many
commodities, for foreign currencies, for interest rates on securities with different
maturities, and even for common stocks where investors want to “hedge their bets.”
Natural hedges occur when futures are traded between cotton farmers and cotton
mills, copper mines and copper fabricators, importers and foreign manufacturers for
currency exchange rates, electric utilities and coal mines, and oil producers and oil
users. In all such situations, hedging reduces aggregate risk and thus benefits the
economy.
Hedging can also be done in situations in which no natural hedge exists. Here one
party wants to reduce some type of risk, and another party agrees to write a contract
that protects the first party from that specific event or situation. Insurance is an obvi-
ous example of this type of hedge. However, with nonsymmetric hedges, risks are
generally transferred rather than eliminated. Even here, though, insurance companies
can reduce certain types of risk through diversification.
The derivatives markets have grown more rapidly than any other major market in
recent years for a number of reasons. First, analytical techniques such as the Black-
Scholes Option Pricing Model (discussed in Chapter 8) have been developed to help
establish “fair” prices, and having a good, transparent basis for pricing hedges makes
the counterparties more comfortable with deals. Second, computers and electronic
communications make it much easier for counterparties to deal with one another.
Third, globalization has greatly increased the importance of currency markets and
the need for reducing the exchange rate risks brought on by global trade. Recent
trends and developments are sure to continue if not accelerate, so the use of deriva-
tives for risk management is bound to grow.4

23.3 DERIVATIVES IN THE NEWS
Although derivatives are important tools for corporate risk management, they also
have a potential downside. These instruments are highly leveraged, so small miscal-
culations can lead to huge losses. They are also complicated and misunderstood by
most people. This makes mistakes more likely than with less complex instruments,
which makes it harder for a firm’s top management to understand and exercise
proper control over derivatives transactions. This potential for miscalculation and

misuse has led to highly publicized losses for some large and well-respected compa-
nies in the past several years. Procter & Gamble (P&G), Gibson Greetings, Metall-
gesellschaft, Barings Bank, Long Term Capital Management (LTCM), Enron, and
Orange County, California, all experienced losses that were either attributed to or
associated with inappropriate use of derivatives. In the Barings Bank case, one rela-
tively low-level 28-year-old employee operating in the Far East entered into transac-
tions that led to the bankruptcy of Britain’s oldest bank, the institution that held the
accounts of the Queen of England.
The widespread use (and misuse) of credit default swaps (CDS) was a major factor
in the failures of financial institution such as AIG, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch,
and Bear Stearns in the global economic crisis that began in 2007. Following are
more detailed explanations of Enron Corporation’s failure and the role of derivatives
in the global economic crisis.
Enron and Other Energy Traders
Most segments of the electric power industry were deregulated during the 1990s.
Previously, all power users were required to buy from their local utility, but after
deregulation large users, which account for about 65% of electricity usage, could
buy from other suppliers. Independent power producers then built plants and began
competing with the older utilities. Power users could buy electricity on the “spot”
market at prices that fluctuated depending on supply and demand, or they could con-
tract with independent producers to buy at a fixed price for delivery in the future.
Thus, the electricity market was transformed from a regulated monopoly into a com-
petitive market that was something akin to the wheat market, where farmers worked
with grain merchants to deliver wheat to milling companies.
However, there is a major difference between wheat and electricity—wheat can be
stored efficiently, and stored wheat mitigates the effects of fluctuations in supply and
demand on prices. Electricity cannot be stored, so supply and demand fluctuations
result in wide price swings, which disrupt both users and producers. It did not take
long for users and producers to realize that all parties would benefit by hedging with
long-term supply contracts at fixed prices. Users would have an assured supply at a
known price, and producers would have a guaranteed market for their power. Thus,
hedging would help all parties, just as it helped wheat farmers and millers.
Enron Corporation was one of the first companies to get into the electricity trad-
ing business. Enron owned a few generating plants, but it operated primarily as a
marketer, buying from merchant generators and reselling to large users. Enron
would sign a multiyear contract to supply specific amounts of electricity at a fixed
price to a customer such as General Motors. For example, it might agree to build a
new plant, expecting to produce power at a cost of 3 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh)
and simultaneously contract to sell the plant’s output at 3.1¢/kWh. The 0.1¢/kWh
margin would cover administrative costs and provide a “normal” profit. Under those
conditions, the PV of the expected revenues would be about equal to the PV of the
expected costs, so the NPV of the new plant would be slightly above zero.5
Now suppose conditions changed so that the cost of producing power fell below
3.0¢/kWh—say, to 2 cents—but the price remained at 3.1 cents. In that case, the
expected cash flows from the new plant would rise, causing the contract’s net present
5Similarly, Enron might sign a long-term contract to buy electricity at 3¢/kWh, expecting to sell it on the
spot market at 3.1 cents. The initial NPV of the contract would be close to zero. However, if demand for
power rose sharply, then the spot price would rise above 3.1 cents, the expected cash flows would rise, and
the contract’s NPV would also rise.

value to increase. Enron would report the increase in the contract’s value as profit
and add it to operating income. The higher profit would then boost the stock price
and trigger executive bonuses.
Such a development would be legal, but Enron cheated. Its executives wanted to
report higher profits in order to trigger bonuses and more stock options, so it
inflated its profits by forecasting unreasonably high sales prices, unreasonably low
purchase costs, and thus unreasonably high profits. It also downplayed the risk inher-
ent in the contracts and discounted the overstated cash flows at unreasonably low
discount rates. All of this should have been caught by its auditor, Arthur Andersen,
but Andersen let Enron get away with it, resulting in reported profits that were far
too high.
Note, too, that California environmentalists had for years prevented the construc-
tion of new plants. The growing demand for power caught up with a fixed supply in
2000, and a shortage resulted. This led to huge price spikes and enormous profits for
generators and traders such as Enron. California then relaxed its restrictions on con-
struction, and Enron’s wonderful reported profits attracted other companies into
considering construction of new plants and getting into the energy trading business.
Some made careful forecasts and concluded that something was fishy because their
forecasts did not produce results anywhere close to those reported by Enron. These
companies wisely avoided the new market. However, others decided that if Enron
could do it, so could they, and they charged ahead with new plant construction,
financed primarily with debt.
When all the new capacity came online, it greatly exceeded demand. This led to
huge price declines, and the builders of new plants found themselves in trouble. A
new plant might have cost $100 million and shown an NPV of $10 million based
on output prices when construction began. However, when the new plant came
online the new low prices might have led to an actual NPV of negative $50 million.
Similarly, a trading company that had contracted to buy power for a long period at,
say, 4¢/kWh, expecting to sell it in the spot market for 5 cents, might have found
that it could only sell the power for 3 cents; this would also result in a negative
NPV for the contract. Those results had to be reflected in the financial statements,
so there were massive reported losses and huge write-downs, which lowered stock-
holder equity on the balance sheets. This, in turn, raised the companies’ debt ratios,
lowered their coverage ratios, and generally reduced their financial strength.
No one wants to sign a long-term contract with a party that might default if things
go badly, so energy traders must have letters of credit that assure counterparties that
they can make good on their contracts. They are required to maintain their financial
ratios at specified levels, and if the covenants are violated then they must put up
additional collateral. Many could not do so, and that led to bankruptcies, including
Enron’s in late 2001.
Some old-line utilities also built merchant plants and thus got into trouble. Exam-
ples include Duke Power and TECO Energy, both of which saw their stock prices
decline by 50% or more in 2002. Southern Company, like several other utilities,
put its merchant plants and trading business into a separate subsidiary (Mirant Cor-
poration) and then spun it off to Southern’s stockholders. That spin-off insulated
Southern from the debacle, so its stock price dropped by only 12% during 2002,
about the same as the general market. However, Mirant itself experienced a huge
drop after the Enron troubles hit in 2001, falling from $47.20 to $1.90. If Southern
had retained Mirant, it probably would have experienced a decline similar to that of
TECO and Duke.

Part 9: Special Topics

The Credit Crisis and Mortgage-Backed Securities
The years 2007 and 2008 saw the meltdown of U.S. and international credit markets.
Banks cut back on lending, and consumers and businesses cut back on spending,
slowing the economy. The driving force behind this meltdown was the bursting of
the U.S. housing market bubble that had developed over the previous decade.
Mortgage-backed securities (discussed in more detail later in this chapter) played a
significant role in this crisis because, as housing prices declined, homeowners who
wanted to move or refinance were unable to do so. This bumped up the default rate
on the home mortgages on which the mortgage-backed securities were based, causing
their values to plummet. Banks had invested huge amounts in these securities, and as
the securities tanked the banks’ equity positions declined, forcing them to scale back
on their lending. This further limited the supply of funds for new mortgages, further
depressing home prices.
As discussed in Chapter 1, purchasers of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) also
often bought credit default swaps in which a counterparty promised to pay the pur-
chaser if the debt defaulted. However, the counterparties, such as AIG and Lehman
Brothers, failed to hedge their own risk. Thus, when mortgage-backed securities
began defaulting, many of the counterparties went bankrupt. And because the “insur-
ance” bought by the MBS purchasers didn’t pay up, many MBS purchasers them-
selves went bankrupt.
Financial institutions’ losses and failures rippled throughout the global economy
and were major contributors to the global economic crisis of 2007.
Are Derivatives Too Dangerous?
Scandals and widespread failures—such as those at Enron, AIG, and Lehman Brothers—
make the headlines, causing some people to argue that derivatives should be
regulated out of existence to “protect the public.” However, derivatives are used far
more often to hedge risks than to speculate, and these beneficial hedging transactions
never make the headlines. The horror stories point out the need for (1) top managers
to exercise control over the personnel who deal with derivatives; (2) more transpar-
ent information about the details and obligations of derivative contracts; (3) better
information about the creditworthiness of the counterparties; and (4) additional
regulation of the amount of capital that financial institutions are required to set aside
when they purchase risky assets. In our opinion, however, the disasters do not justify
the elimination of derivatives.
In the balance of this chapter, we discuss how firms can manage risks and how
derivatives are used in risk management.
Self-Test
Describe some examples of the misuse of derivatives.
23.4 OTHER TYPES OF DERIVATIVES
We discussed put and call options in Chapter 8. They represent an important class of
derivative securities, but there are many other types of derivatives, including forward
contracts, futures, swaps, structured notes, inverse floaters, and a host of other
“exotic” contracts.
Forward Contracts versus Futures Contracts
Forward contracts are agreements in which one party agrees to buy a commodity at
a specific price on a specific future date and the other party agrees to sell the product.
Chapter 23: Derivatives and Risk Management
907

Goods are actually delivered under forward contracts. Unless both parties are morally and
financially strong, there is a danger that one party will default on the contract, espe-
cially if the price of the commodity changes markedly after the agreement is reached.
A futures contract is similar to a forward contract, but with three key differences:
(1) Futures contracts are marked-to-market on a daily basis, meaning that gains and
losses are noted and money must be put up to cover losses. This greatly reduces the
risk of default that exists with forward contracts. (2) With futures, physical delivery of
the underlying asset is virtually never taken—the two parties simply settle up with
cash for the difference between the contracted price and the actual price on the expi-
ration date. (3) Futures contracts are generally standardized instruments that are
traded on exchanges, whereas forward contracts are usually tailor-made, negotiated
between two parties, and not traded after they have been signed.
Futures and forward contracts were originally used for commodities such as wheat;
farmers would sell forward contracts to millers, enabling both parties to lock in prices
and thus reduce their risk exposure. Commodities contracts are still important, but
today more trading is done in foreign exchange and interest rate futures. To illustrate
how foreign exchange contracts are used, suppose GE arranges to buy electric motors
from a European manufacturer on terms that call for GE to pay 10 million euros in
180 days. GE would not want to give up the free trade credit, but if the euro appre-
ciated against the dollar during the next 6 months then the dollar cost of the 10 million
euros would rise. GE could hedge the transaction by buying a forward contract under
which it agreed to buy the 10 million euros in 180 days at a fixed dollar price, which
would lock in the dollar cost of the motors. This transaction would probably be
conducted through a money center bank, which would try to find a European
company (a “counterparty”) that needed dollars in 6 months. Alternatively, GE could
buy a futures contract on an exchange.
Interest rate futures represent another huge and growing market. For example,
suppose Simonset Corporation decides to build a new plant at a cost of $200 million.
It plans to finance the project with 20-year bonds that would carry an 8% interest
rate if they were issued today. However, the company will not need the money for
about 6 months. Simonset could go ahead and sell 20-year bonds now, locking in
the 8% rate, but it would have the money before it was needed, so it would have to
invest in short-term securities that would yield less than 8%. However, if Simonset
waits 6 months to sell the bond issue then interest rates might be higher than they
are today, in which case the value of the plant would be reduced—perhaps to the
point of making it unprofitable.
One solution to Simonset’s dilemma involves interest rate futures, which are based
on a hypothetical 20-year Treasury bond with a 6% semiannual coupon. If interest
rates in the economy go up, the value of the hypothetical T-bond will go down,
and vice versa. In our example, Simonset is worried about an increase in interest
rates. Should rates rise, the hypothetical Treasury bond’s value would decline.
Therefore, Simonset could sell T-bond futures for delivery in 6 months to hedge its
position. If interest rates rise, Simonset will have to pay a higher interest rate when it
issues its own bonds. However, it will make a profit on its futures position because it
will have presold the bonds at a higher price than it will have to pay to cover (repur-
chase) them. Of course, if interest rates decline then Simonset will lose on its futures
position, but this will be offset by the lower interest rate paid when it issues its bonds.
Our examples show that forward contracts and futures can be used to hedge, or
reduce, risks. It has been estimated that more than 95% of all such transactions are
indeed designed as hedges, with banks and futures dealers serving as intermediaries
between hedging counterparties. Interest rate and exchange rate futures can, of
908
Part 9: Special Topics

course, be used for speculative as well as hedging purposes. A hedger can buy a T-
bond contract on $100,000 of bonds with only $3,200 collateral (this is called the
margin or the performance bond); a speculator must put down $4,320. With such
small initial investments, even a minor change in interest rates will result in a very
large gain or loss. Still, the primary motivation behind the vast majority of these
transactions is to hedge risks, not to create them.
Swaps
A swap is just what the name implies—two parties agree to swap something, gener-
ally obligations to make specified payment streams. Most swaps today involve either
interest payments or currencies, but just about anything can be swapped, including
equity swaps, credit spread swaps, and commodity swaps.6 To illustrate an interest
rate swap, suppose that Company S has a 20-year, $100 million floating-rate bond
outstanding and that Company F has a $100 million, 20-year, fixed-rate issue out-
standing. Thus, each company has an obligation to make a stream of interest pay-
ments, but one payment stream is fixed while the other will vary as interest rates
change in the future. This situation is shown in the top part of Figure 23-1.
Now suppose that Company S has stable cash flows and wants to lock in its cost of
debt. Company F has cash flows that fluctuate with the economy, rising when the
economy is strong and falling when it is weak. Recognizing that interest rates also
move up and down with the economy, Company F has concluded it would be better
off with variable-rate debt. If the companies swapped their payment obligations, an
interest rate swap would occur. The bottom half of Figure 23-1 shows that the net
cash flows for Company S are at a fixed rate and those for Company F are based on
a floating rate. Company S would now have to make fixed payments, which are con-
sistent with its stable cash inflows, and Company F would have a floating obligation,
which for it is less risky.
Our example illustrates how swaps can reduce risks by allowing each company to
match the variability of its interest payments with that of its cash flows. However, there
are also situations in which swaps can reduce both the riskiness and the effective cost of
debt. For example, Antron Corporation, which has a high credit rating, can issue either
floating-rate debt at LIBOR + 1% or fixed-rate debt at 10%.7 Bosworth Industries is
less creditworthy, so its cost for floating-rate debt is LIBOR + 1.5% and its fixed-rate
cost is 10.4%. Owing to the nature of Antron’s operations, its CFO has decided that
the firm would be better off with fixed-rate debt; meanwhile, Bosworth’s CFO prefers
floating-rate debt. Paradoxically, both firms can benefit by issuing the type of debt
they do not want and then swapping their payment obligations.
First, each company will issue an identical amount of debt, which is called the
notional principal. Even though Antron wants fixed-rate debt, it issues floating-
rate debt at LIBOR + 1%, and Bosworth issues fixed-rate debt at 10.4%. Next, the
two companies enter into an interest rate swap.8 Assume the debt maturities are

6In an equity swap, the cash flow based on an equity index is swapped for some other cash flow. In a
commodity swap, the swapped cash flow is based on commodity prices. In a credit swap, the cash flow
usually is based on the spread between a risky bond and a U.S. Treasury bond.
7LIBOR stands for the London Interbank Offered Rate, the rate charged on interbank dollar loans in the
Eurodollar market.
8Actually, such transactions are generally arranged by large money center banks, and payments are made
to the bank, which in turn pays the interest on the original loans. The bank assumes the credit risk and
guarantees the payments should one of the parties default. For its services, the bank receives a percentage
of the payments as its fee.

5 years, which means the length of this swap will also be 5 years. By convention, the
floating-rate payments of most swaps are based on LIBOR, with the fixed rate
adjusted upward or downward to reflect credit risk and the term structure. The
riskier the company that will receive the floating-rate payments, the higher the
fixed-rate payment it must make. In our example, Antron will be receiving floating-
rate payments from Bosworth, and those payments will be set at LIBOR multiplied
by the notional principal. Then, payments will be adjusted every 6 months to reflect
changes in the LIBOR rate.
The fixed payment that Antron must make to Bosworth is set (that is, “fixed”) for
the duration of the swap at the time the contract is signed, and it depends primarily

Part 9: Special Topics

on two factors: (1) the level of fixed interest rates at the time of the agreement and
(2) the relative creditworthiness of the two companies.
In our example, assume interest rates and creditworthiness are such that 8.95% is
the appropriate fixed swap rate for Antron, so it will make 8.95% fixed-rate payments
to Bosworth. In turn, Bosworth will pay the LIBOR rate to Antron. Table 23-1
shows the net rates paid by each participant, and Figure 23-2 graphs the flows.
Note that Antron ends up making fixed payments, which it desires, but because of
the swap the rate paid is 9.95% versus the 10% rate it would have paid had it issued
fixed-rate debt directly. At the same time, the swap leaves Bosworth with floating-
rate debt, which it wants, but at a rate of LIBOR + 1.45% versus the LIBOR +
1.50% it would have paid on directly issued floating-rate debt. As this example illus-
trates, swaps can sometimes lower the interest rate paid by each party.
Currency swaps are similar to interest rate swaps. To illustrate, suppose Com-
pany A, an American firm, had issued $100 million of dollar denominated bonds in
the United States to fund an investment in Germany. Meanwhile, Company G, a
German firm, had issued $100 million of euro denominated bonds in Germany to
make an investment in the United States. Company A would earn euros but be
required to make payments in dollars, and Company G would be in the opposite
situation. Thus, both companies would be exposed to exchange rate risk. However,
both companies’ risks would be eliminated if they swapped payment obligations.

Originally, swaps were arranged between companies by money center banks,
which would match up counterparties. Such matching still occurs, but today most
swaps are between companies and banks, with the banks then taking steps to ensure
that their own risks are hedged. For example, Citibank might arrange a swap with
Company A. Company A would agree to make specified payments in euros to Citi-
bank, while Citibank made dollar payments to Company A. Citibank would charge a
fee for setting up the swap, and these charges would reflect the creditworthiness of
Company A. To protect itself against exchange rate movements, the bank would
hedge its position, either by lining up a European company that needed to make dol-
lar payments or else by using currency futures.9
Structured Notes and Collateralized Mortgage Obligations
The term structured note often means a debt obligation that is derived from some
other debt obligation. For example, Wall Street firms buy large packages of mort-
gages and place these packages, or “pools,” with a trustee. Then bonds called Collat-
eralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs), backed by the mortgage pool held in trust, are
sold to pension funds, hedge funds, university endowments, and other investors who
are willing to invest in CMOs but who would not purchase individual mortgages.
There is an entire industry devoted to creating and selling various types of these
mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
CMOs are more difficult to evaluate than straight bonds for several reasons. First,
the underlying mortgages can be prepaid at any time, and when this occurs the prepay-
ment proceeds are used to retire part of the CMO debt itself. Therefore, the holder of
a CMO is never sure when his or her bond will be called. This situation is further
complicated by the fact that, when interest rates decline, bond prices normally rise.
However, declining rates also lead to mortgage prepayments, which cause the CMOs
to be called especially rapidly, and it is not good to have bonds called when the funds
must be reinvested at a lower rate. And as we learned during the 2007 global economic
crisis, default risk can be very high for mortgage-backed securities.
It should also be noted that a variety of structured notes can be created, ranging
from notes whose cash flows can be predicted with virtual certainty to other notes
whose payment streams are highly uncertain. For example, investment bankers can
(and do) create notes called IOs (for Interest Only), which provide cash flows from
the interest component of the mortgage amortization payments, and POs (for Princi-
pal Only), which are paid from the principal repayment stream. In each case, the value
of the note is found as the present value of an expected payment stream, but the
length and size of the stream are uncertain. Suppose, for example, you are offered
an IO that you expect to provide payments of $100 for 10 years (you expect the
mortgages to be refinanced after 10 years, at which time your payments will cease).
Suppose further that you discount the expected payment stream at a rate of 10% and
determine the value is $614.46. You have $614.46 to invest, so you buy the IO,
expecting to earn 10% on your money.
Now suppose interest rates decline. If rates fall, the discount rate would drop, and
that would normally imply an increase in the IO’s value. However, if rates decline

tions in the Design of Interest Rate Swaps,” Financial Management, Summer 1993, pp. 94–105; Robert

sharply, this would lead to a rash of mortgage refinancings, in which case your pay-
ments, which come from interest only, would cease (or be greatly reduced), and the
value of your IO would fall sharply. On the other hand, a sharp increase in interest
rates would reduce refinancing, lengthen your expected payment stream, and proba-
bly increase the value of your IO.
Investment bankers can slice and dice a pool of mortgages into a bewildering array
of structured notes, ranging from “plain vanilla” ones with highly predictable cash
flows to “exotic” ones (sometimes called “toxic waste”) whose risks are almost incal-
culable but are surely large.
Securitizing mortgages through CMOs serves a useful economic function—it pro-
vides an investment outlet for pension funds and others with money to invest, and it
makes more money available to homeowners at a reasonable cost. Also, some inves-
tors want relatively safe investments, while others are willing to buy more speculative
securities for the higher expected returns they provide. Structured notes permit a
partitioning of risks to give investors what they want. There are dangers, though, as
the 2007 global economic crisis demonstrates, in which “toxic waste” led to numer-
ous bankruptcies and contributed to a global recession.
Inverse Floaters
A floating-rate note has an interest rate that rises and falls with some interest rate
index. For example, if the prime rate were currently 8.5%, then the interest rate on
a $100,000 note at prime plus 1% would be 9.5% and the note’s rate would move up
and down with the prime rate. Because both the cash flows associated with the note
and the discount rate used to value it would rise and fall together, the market value of
the note would be relatively stable.
With an inverse floater, the rate paid on the note moves counter to market rates. Thus,
if interest rates in the economy rise, the interest rate paid on an inverse floater will fall,
reducing its cash interest payments. At the same time, the discount rate used to value the
inverse floater’s cash flows will rise along with other rates. The combined effect of lower
cash flows and a higher discount rate would lead to a large decline in the value of the
inverse floater. Thus, inverse floaters are exceptionally vulnerable to increases in interest
rates. Of course, if interest rates fall then the value of an inverse floater will soar.
Could an inverse floater be used for hedging purposes? The answer is “yes, per-
haps quite effectively.” These securities have a magnified effect, so not many are
required to hedge a given position. However, because they are so volatile, they could
make what is supposed to be a hedged position actually quite risky.
We have discussed the most important types of derivative securities, but certainly
not all types. Even so, this discussion should give you a good idea of how and why
derivatives are created and how they can be used and misused.

23.5 CORPORATE RISK MANAGEMENT
As businesses become increasingly complex, it is becoming more and more difficult
for CEOs and directors to know what problems might lie in wait. Therefore, compa-
nies need to have someone systematically look for potential problems and design

safeguards to minimize potential damage. With this in mind, most large firms have a
designated “risk manager” who reports to the chief financial officer, and the CFOs of
smaller firms personally assume risk management responsibilities. In any event, risk
management is becoming increasingly important, and it is something finance stu-
dents should understand. Therefore, in the remainder of this chapter we discuss the
basics of risk management, with particular emphasis on how derivatives can be used
to hedge financial risks.10
Types of Risk
It is useful to begin our discussion of risk management by defining some commonly
used terms that describe different risks. Some of these risks can be mitigated, or man-
aged, and that is what risk management is all about.
1. Pure risks are risks that offer only the prospect of a loss. Examples include the risk
that a plant will be destroyed by fire or that a product liability suit will result in a
large judgment against the firm.
2. Speculative risks are situations that offer the chance of a gain but might result in a
loss. Investments in new projects and marketable securities involve speculative
risks.
3. Demand risks are associated with the demand for a firm’s products or services.
Because sales are essential to all businesses, demand risk is one of the most sig-
nificant risks that firms face.
4. Input risks are risks associated with input costs, including both labor and materi-
als. Thus, a company that uses copper as a raw material in its manufacturing
process faces the risk that the cost of copper will increase and that it will not be
able to pass this increase on to its customers.
5. Financial risks are risks that result from financial transactions. As we have seen, if
a firm plans to issue new bonds then it faces the risk that interest rates will
increase before the bonds can be brought to market. Similarly, if the firm enters
into contracts with foreign customers or suppliers, it faces the risk that fluctua-
tions in exchange rates will result in unanticipated losses.
6. Property risks are associated with destruction of productive assets. Thus, the
threats of fire, floods, and riots impose property risks on a firm.
7. Personnel risks are risks that result from employees’ actions. Examples include the
risks associated with employee fraud or embezzlement and suits based on charges
of age or sex discrimination.
8. Environmental risks include risks associated with polluting the environment. Pub-
lic awareness in recent years, coupled with the huge costs of environmental
cleanup, has increased the importance of this risk.
9. Liability risks are associated with products, services, or employee actions. Exam-
ples include the very large judgments assessed against asbestos manufacturers and
some health care providers as well as costs incurred as a result of improper
actions of employees, such as driving corporate vehicles in a reckless manner.

Part 9: Special Topics

10. Insurable risks are risks that can be covered by insurance. In general, property,
personnel, environmental, and liability risks can be transferred to insurance
companies. Note, though, that the ability to insure a risk does not necessarily
mean that the risk should be insured. Indeed, a major function of risk management
involves evaluating all alternatives for managing a particular risk, including self-
insurance, and then choosing the optimal alternative.
Note that the risk classifications we used are somewhat arbitrary, and different clas-
sifications are commonly used in different industries. However, the list does give an
idea of the wide variety of risks to which a firm can be exposed.
An Approach to Risk Management
Firms often use the following process for managing risks.
1. Identify the risks faced by the firm. Here the risk manager identifies the potential
risks faced by his or her firm.
2. Measure the potential effect of each risk. Some risks are so small as to be immaterial,
whereas others have the potential for dooming the company. It is useful to
segregate risks by potential effect and then to focus on the most serious threats.
3. Decide how each relevant risk should be handled. In most situations, risk exposure
can be reduced through one of the following techniques.
a. Transfer the risk to an insurance company. Often, it is advantageous to insure
against, and hence transfer, a risk. However, insurability does not necessarily
mean that a risk should be covered by insurance. In many instances, it might
be better for the company to self-insure, which means bearing the risk directly
rather than paying another party to bear it.
b. Transfer the function that produces the risk to a third party. For example, suppose a
furniture manufacturer is concerned about potential liabilities arising from its
ownership of a fleet of trucks used to transfer products from its manufacturing
plant to various points across the country. One way to eliminate this risk would be
to contract with a trucking company to do the shipping, thus passing the risks to a
third party.
c. Purchase derivative contracts to reduce risk. As we indicated earlier, firms use de-
rivatives to hedge risks. Commodity derivatives can be used to reduce input
risks. For example, a cereal company may use corn or wheat futures to hedge
against increases in grain prices. Similarly, financial derivatives can be used to
reduce risks that arise from changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
d. Reduce the probability of occurrence of an adverse event. The expected loss arising
from any risk is a function of both the probability of occurrence and the dollar loss if
the adverse event occurs. In some instances, it is possible to reduce the probability
that an adverse event will occur. For example, the probability that a fire will occur
can be reduced by instituting a fire prevention program, by replacing old electrical
wiring, and by using fire-resistant materials in areas with the greatest fire potential.
e. Reduce the magnitude of the loss associated with an adverse event. Continuing with
the fire risk example, the dollar cost associated with a fire can be reduced by
such actions as installing sprinkler systems, designing facilities with self-
contained fire zones, and locating facilities close to a fire station.
f. Totally avoid the activity that gives rise to the risk. For example, a company might
discontinue a product or service line because the risks outweigh the rewards, as
with the decision by Dow Corning to discontinue its manufacture of silicon
breast implants.

Risk management decisions, like all corporate decisions, should be based on a
cost–benefit analysis for each feasible alternative. For example, suppose it would
cost $50,000 per year to conduct a comprehensive fire safety training program for
all personnel in a high-risk plant. Presumably, this program would reduce the
expected value of future fire losses. An alternative to the training program would be
to place $50,000 annually in a reserve fund set aside to cover future fire losses. Both
alternatives involve expected cash flows, and from an economic standpoint the choice
should be made on the basis of the lowest present value of future costs. Thus, the
same financial management techniques applied to other corporate decisions can also
be applied to risk management decisions. However, if a fire occurs and a life is lost,
the trade-off between fire prevention and expected losses may not sit well with a jury.
The same thing holds true for product liability—as Firestone, Ford, GM, and others
have learned.
Enterprise Risk Management and Value at Risk
Throughout this book we have emphasized the goal of
maximizing a company’s intrinsic value. At the risk of
simplification, risk management seeks to identify and
control threats to intrinsic value.
A company’s total intrinsic value is the sum of the
intrinsic values of all its projects and business units.
But if each business unit performs its own capital bud-
geting analysis without considering the impacts on
other business units, then total intrinsic value almost
certainly will not be maximized. For example, the costs
of better sales forecasting systems might be borne
by the marketing department while the benefits of
lower inventory and smoother production would accrue
to factory and warehouse managers. Therefore, maxi-
mizing total intrinsic value often requires using a corpo-
rate valuation model such as the ones described in
Chapter 13.
Similar reasoning applies to risk management: It is
suboptimal if each business unit is solely responsible
for managing its own risk in isolation from other busi-
ness units. Therefore, many companies now use enter-
prise resource management (ERM) to coordinate and
control total risk. The more complex an organization
is, the more important it is to have effective ERM. For
example, many large financial institutions failed in
2007–2009 partly because they did not understand or
coordinate the risks from their wide scope of activities,
which included investment banking, trading, and insur-
ance in addition to commercial banking. On the other
hand, many small commercial banks weathered this
environment partly because they engaged in a fairly
limited set of activities, which enabled the small banks
to understand their risk exposure.
How should a company measure its enterprise risk?
One common metric is called value at risk, or VaR. To
estimate VaR, many companies use scenario analysis
or Monte Carlo simulation. The process begins by iden-
tifying sources of risk and estimating the sources’ prob-
ability distributions. For example, sources might include
foreign exchange rate volatility, changes in consumer
demand, or access to credit markets. The next step is to
estimate the impact that these sources have on a partic-
ular output, such as cash flow, earnings, or total intrinsic
value. In particular, the goal is to estimate the resulting
probability distribution for the output. The third step is to
identify an acceptable risk threshold; for example, many
companies use 5% or 1%. The final step is to identify the
value at risk, which is the value of the output corre-
sponding to the threshold. For example, suppose a com-
pany uses a 1% threshold and estimates a −$100 million
VaR for its projected cash flow for the upcoming quarter.
In other words, there is a 1% probability that the com-
pany will have a quarterly cash flow lower than −$100
million. If this VaR is unacceptable, then management
must take actions to reduce the risk.
In 2009, the government subjected 19 large banks to
stress tests designed to determine whether the banks
had enough capital to withstand potential deterioration
in the economy. After conducting these tests, the gov-
ernment essentially decided that the VaR was unaccept-
able for 10 of the banks and told them they needed to
raise $75 billion in capital.

23.6 USING DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE RISKS
Firms are subject to numerous risks related to interest rate, stock price, and exchange
rate fluctuations in the financial markets. For an investor, one of the most obvious
ways to reduce financial risks is to hold a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks and
debt securities, including international securities and debt of varying maturities.
However, derivatives can also be used to reduce the risks associated with financial
and commodity markets.11
Hedging with Futures
One of the most useful tools for reducing interest rate, exchange rate, and commod-
ity risk is to hedge in the futures markets. Most financial and real asset transactions
occur in what is known as the spot, or cash, market, where the asset is delivered imme-
diately (or within a few days). Futures, or futures contracts, on the other hand, call for
the purchase or sale of an asset at some future date but at a price that is fixed today.
Today, futures contracts are available on hundreds of real and financial assets
traded on dozens of U.S. and international exchanges, the largest of which are the
Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME),
both of which are now part of the CME Group. Futures contracts are divided into
two classes, commodity futures and financial futures. Commodity futures—which
cover oil, various grains, oilseeds, livestock, meats, fibers, metals, and wood—were
first traded in the United States in the mid-1800s. Financial futures, which were first
traded in 1975, include Treasury bills, notes, bonds, certificates of deposit, Eurodol-
lar deposits, foreign currencies, and stock indexes.
To illustrate how futures contracts work, consider the CBOT’s contract on Trea-
sury bonds. The basic contract is for $100,000 of a hypothetical 6% coupon, semian-
nual payment Treasury bond with 20 years to maturity.12 Table 23-2 shows Treasury
bond futures data from the Chicago Board of Trade.
The first column of the table gives the delivery month, and the next two columns
give the last price of the day and the change in price from the previous day. For
example, the last price for the March 2010 contract, 116’17.0, means 116 plus 17.0/32,
or 116.531250%, of par. This is often called the settlement price. The change was 0’19,
which means the March 2010 contract’s last price of the day was 19/32 higher than the
previous day’s last trade, which must have been at 115’30.0. The next three columns
show the opening, high, and low prices for that contract on that day. Column 7 shows
the day’s estimated trading volume. Notice that most of the trading occurs in the
11In Chapter 17 we discussed the risks involved with holding foreign currencies as well as procedures for
reducing such risks.
12The coupon rate on the hypothetical bond was changed to 6% from 8% in March 2000. The CBOT
contract doesn’t actually specify a 20-year bond but instead allows delivery of any noncallable bond with
a remaining maturity greater than 15 years (or callable bond that is not callable for at least 15 years).
Rather than simply deliver a bond, which might have an interest rate other than 6%, the actual bond
price is adjusted by a conversion feature to make it equivalent to a 6% bond that is trading at par. Because
the average maturity of bonds that are eligible for delivery is about 20 years, we use a 20-year maturity for
the hypothetical bond in the futures contract.
Chapter 23: Derivatives and Risk Management
917

contract with the nearest delivery date. Finally, Column 8 shows the “open interest,”
which is the number of contracts outstanding.
To illustrate, we focus on the Treasury bonds for March delivery. The settlement
price was 116.531250% of the $100,000 contract value. Thus, the price at which one
could buy $100,000 face value of 6%, 20-year Treasury bonds to be delivered in
March was 116.531250% ($100,000) = $116,531.250. The contract price increased by
19/32 of 1% of $100,000 from the previous day, so if you had bought the contract yes-
terday, you would have made $593.75 = (19/32)($100,000). There were 43 contracts
outstanding, representing a total value of about 43($116,531.250) = $5,010,843.75.
Note that the contract increased by 19/32 of a percent on this particular day. Why
would the value of the bond futures contract increase? Bond prices increase when inter-
est rates fall, so interest rates must have fallen on that day. Moreover, we can calculate
the implied rates inherent in the futures contracts. Recall that the contract relates to a
hypothetical 20-year, semiannual payment, 6% coupon bond. The settlement price was
116.531250% of par, so a $1,000 par bond would have a price of 116.531250%($1,000) =
$1,165.31250. We can solve for rd by using the following equation:
∑
40
t¼1
$30
ð1 þ rd=2Þt þ
$1; 000
ð1 þ rd=2Þ40 ¼ $1;165:31250
Using a financial calculator, input N = 40, PV = −1165.31250, PMT = 30, and FV =
1000; then solve for I/YR = 2.3572. This is the semiannual rate, which is equivalent to
a nominal annual rate of 4.7144%, or approximately 4.71%. The previous day’s last
(settlement) price was 11530/32. Setting N = 40, PV = −1159.3750, PMT = 30, and
FV = 1000 and then solving for I/YR = 2.3781 implies an annual yield of 4.7562%, or
approximately 4.76%. Therefore, interest rates fell by about 5 basis points from the
previous day, but that was enough to increase the value of the contract by $593.75.
In August 2009, when the data in Table 23-2 were gathered, the yield on a
20-year T-bond was about 3.56%. But as we just calculated, the implied yield on
the March 2010 futures contract was about 4.71%. The March yield reflects inves-
tors’ beliefs as to what the interest rate level will be in March: The marginal trader
in the futures market was predicting a 116-basis-point increase in yields between
August and March. That prediction could, of course, turn out to be incorrect.
Now suppose that 3 months later, in November, implied yields in the futures mar-
ket had fallen from the earlier levels—say, from 4.71% to 4.21%. Inputting N = 40,
I/YR = 4.21/2 = 2.105, PMT = 30, and FV = 1000 and then solving for PV =
−1240.3830 shows that the March contract would be worth about $124,038.30 in
November if implied yields fell to 4.21%. Thus, the contract’s value would have
increased by $124,038.30 −$116,531.250 ≈$7,507.

Part 9: Special Topics

When futures contracts are purchased, the purchaser does not have to put up the
full amount of the purchase price; instead, the purchaser need only post an initial
margin, which for CBOT Treasury bond contracts is $3,200 per $100,000 contract.13
However, investors are required to maintain a certain value in the margin account,
called a maintenance margin. If the value of the contract declines, then the owner may
be required to add additional funds to the margin account, and the more the contract
value falls, the more money must be added. The value of the contract is checked at the
end of every working day, and margin account adjustments are made at that time. This
is called “marking to market.” If an investor purchased our illustrative contract and
then sold it later for $124,038.30, then she would have made a profit of $7,507 on a
$3,200 investment, or a return of 135% in only 3 months. Thus it is clear that futures
contracts offer a considerable amount of leverage. Of course, if interest rates had risen,
then the value of the contract would have fallen and the investor could easily have lost
her $3,200, or more. Futures contracts are rarely settled by delivery of the securities
involved. Rather, the transaction is completed by reversing the trade, which amounts
to selling the contract back to the original seller.14 The actual gains and losses on the
contract are realized when the futures contract is closed.
Futures contracts and options are similar to one another—so similar that people
often confuse the two. Therefore, it is useful to compare the two instruments. A
futures contract is a definite agreement on the part of one party to buy something on
a specific date and at a specific price, and the other party agrees to sell on the same
terms. No matter how low or how high the price goes, the two parties must settle the
contract at the agreed-upon price. An option, on the other hand, gives someone the
right to buy (call) or sell (put) an asset, but the holder of the option does not have
to complete the transaction. Note also that options exist both for individual stocks
and for “bundles” of stocks such as those in the S&P and Value Line indexes, but gen-
erally not for commodities. Futures, on the other hand, are used for commodities,
debt securities, and stock indexes. These two types of instruments can be used for
the same purposes. One is not necessarily better or worse than the other—they are
simply different.15
Security Price Exposure
All investors are exposed to losses due to changes in security prices when securities
are held in investment portfolios, and firms are also exposed during times when secu-
rities are being issued. In addition, firms are exposed to risk if they use floating-rate
debt to finance an investment that produces a fixed income stream. Risks such as
these can often be mitigated by using derivatives. As we discussed earlier, derivatives
are securities whose value stems, or is derived, from the values of other assets. Thus,
options and futures contracts are derivatives, because their values depend on the
prices of some underlying asset. Now we will explore further the use of two types
of derivatives, futures and swaps, to help manage certain types of risk.
13This is the margin requirement for hedgers. Speculators have a different margin requirement.
14The buyers and sellers of most financial futures contracts do not actually trade with one another—each
trader’s contractual obligation is with a futures exchange. This feature helps to guarantee the fiscal integ-
rity of the trade. Incidentally, commodities futures traded on the exchanges are settled in the same way as
financial futures, but in the case of commodities much of the contracting is done off the exchange,
between farmers and processors, as forward contracts, in which case actual deliveries occur.

Futures.
Futures are used for both speculation and hedging. Speculation involves
betting on future price movements, and futures are used because of the leverage
inherent in the contract. Hedging, on the other hand, is done by a firm or individual
to protect against a price change that would otherwise negatively affect profits. For
example, rising interest rates and commodity (raw material) prices can hurt profits,
as can adverse currency fluctuations. If two parties have mirror-image risks, then
they can enter into a transaction that eliminates, rather than transfers, risks. This is
a “natural hedge.” Of course, one party to a futures contract could be a speculator,
the other a hedger. Thus, to the extent that speculators broaden the market and
make hedging possible, they help decrease risk for those who seek to avoid it.
There are two basic types of hedges: (1) long hedges, in which futures contracts
are bought in anticipation of (or to guard against) price increases, and (2) short
hedges, where a firm or individual sells futures contracts to guard against price
declines. Recall that rising interest rates lower bond prices and thus decrease the
value of bond futures contracts. Therefore, if a firm or individual needs to guard
against an increase in interest rates, a futures contract that makes money if rates rise
should be used. That means selling, or going short, on a futures contract. To illus-
trate, assume that in August Carson Foods is considering a plan to issue $10,000,000
of 20-year bonds in March to finance a capital expenditure program. The interest
rate would be 9% paid semiannually if the bonds were issued today, and at that rate
the project would have a positive NPV. However, interest rates may rise, and when
the issue is actually sold, the interest rate might be substantially above 9%, which
would make the project a bad investment. Carson can protect itself against a rise in
rates by hedging in the futures market.
In this situation, Carson would be hurt by an increase in interest rates, so it would
use a short hedge. It would choose a futures contract on the security most similar to
the one it plans to issue, long-term bonds, and so would probably hedge with March
Treasury bond futures. We can see from Table 23-2 that each March contract has a
value of 116’17.0, so the total value of one contract is $116,531.250. Because it plans
to issue $10,000,000 of bonds and because each contract is worth $116,531.250,
Risk Management in the Cyber Economy
In the old bricks-and-mortar economy, most of a com-
pany’s value was due to its tangible assets. Not so in the
cyber economy, where value is due to intellectual prop-
erty and networks that manage knowledge bases. Insur-
ance companies are rapidly developing new types of
insurance policies to protect these valuable cyber assets.
Intellectual property (IP) insurance now covers “all in-
tellectual property—patents, trademarks, trade secrets,
copyright—and includes defense, as well as enforcement,
of intellectual property rights,” according to Judith Pear-
son, director of Aon Corp.’s financial services group.
These policies can cover losses in excess of $200 million,
with premiums ranging from 1% to 5% of the coverage.
Insurers also provide coverage for breaches in
network security. For example, companies can buy
insurance to cover cases of cyberextortion, such as the
demand
for
$100,000
by
the
hacker
“Maxus”
in
exchange for not publicly releasing 300,000 credit card
numbers stolen from CD Universe. Other policies cover
content defamation, copyright and trademark infringe-
ment, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, theft of infor-
mation, and destruction or alteration of data. Costs of
insurance have fallen to between 1% and 3% of the pol-
icy’s coverage, but most insurers subject applicants to a
thorough review of their current security measures
before granting coverage.

Part 9: Special Topics

Carson will sell $10,000,000/$116,531.250 = 85.81 ≈86 contracts for delivery in
March. It will have to put up 86($3,200) = $275,200 in margin money and also pay
brokerage commissions. The total value of the 86 contracts is 86($116,531.250) =
$10,021,688.00, which is very close to the value of the bonds Carson wants to issue.
Now suppose that in March, when Carson issues its bonds, renewed fears of infla-
tion push interest rates up by 100 basis points. What would the bond proceeds be if
Carson still tried to issue 9% coupon bonds when the market requires a 10% rate of
return? We can find the total value of the offering with a financial calculator, input-
ting N = 40, I/YR = 5, PMT = −450000, and FV = −10000000 and then solving for
PV = 9142046. Therefore, bonds with a 9% coupon, based upon its original plans,
would bring proceeds of only $9,142,046, because investors now require a 10%
return. Because Carson would have to issue $10 million worth of bonds at a 10%
rate, Carson’s cost would go up by $857,954 = $10,000,000 −$9,142,046 as a result
of delaying the financing.
However, the increase in interest rates would also bring about a change in the value of
Carson’s short position in the futures market. When interest rates increase, the value of
the futures contract will fall. If the interest rate on the futures contract also increased by
the same full percentage point, from 4.714% to 5.714%, then the new contract value can
be found by inputting N = 40, I/YR = 5.714/2 = 2.857, PMT = −3000, and FV =
−100000 and then solving for PV = 103383.17 per contract. With 86 contracts, the total
value of the position is thus $8,890,953.00 = 86($103,383.17). Carson would then close
its position in the futures market by repurchasing for $8,890,953.00 the contracts that it
earlier sold short for $10,021,688.00, giving it a profit of $1,130,735.00 (less
commissions).
Thus, Carson would offset the loss on the bond issue if we ignore commissions
and the opportunity cost of the margin money. In fact, in our example Carson more
than offsets the loss, pocketing an additional $272,781 = $1,130,735 −$857,954. Of
course, if interest rates had fallen then Carson would have lost on its futures position,
but this loss would have been offset because Carson could now sell its bonds with a
lower coupon.
If futures contracts existed on Carson’s own debt and if interest rates moved iden-
tically in the spot and futures markets, then the firm could construct a perfect hedge
in which gains on the futures contract would exactly offset losses on the bonds. In
reality, it is virtually impossible to construct perfect hedges, because in most cases
the underlying asset is not identical to the futures asset; and even when the assets
are, prices (and interest rates) may not move exactly together in the spot and futures
markets.16
Observe also that if Carson had been planning an equity offering and if its stock
tended to move fairly closely with one of the stock indexes, then the company could
have hedged against falling stock prices by selling short the index future. Even better,
if options on Carson’s stock were traded in the options market, then it could use
options rather than futures to hedge against falling stock prices.
The futures and options markets permit flexibility in the timing of financial trans-
actions: the firm can be protected, at least partially, against changes that occur

16In this example, Carson hedged a 20-year bond with a T-bond futures contract. Rather than simply
matching on maturity, it would be more accurate to match on duration (see Web Extension 5C, available
on the textbook’s Web site, for a discussion of duration). A matching duration in the futures contacts
could be accomplished by taking positions in the T-bond futures contract and in another financial futures
contract, such as the 10-Year Treasury note contract. Because Carson’s bond had a 20-year maturity,
matching on maturity instead of duration provided a good hedge. If Carson’s bond had a different matu-
rity, then it would be essential to match on duration.

between the time a decision is reached and the time when the transaction is com-
pleted. However, this protection has a cost—the firm must pay commissions.
Whether or not the protection is worth the cost is a matter of judgment. The deci-
sion to hedge also depends on management’s risk aversion and on the company’s
strength and ability to assume the risk in question.
Swaps.
A swap is another method for reducing financial risks. As we noted earlier,
a swap is an exchange of cash payment obligations in which each party prefers the
payment type or pattern of the other party. Generally, one party has a fixed-rate
obligation and the other a floating-rate obligation, or one has an obligation denomi-
nated in one currency and the other in another currency.
Major changes have occurred over time in the swaps market. First, standardized
contracts have been developed for the most common types of swaps, which has had
two effects: (1) Standardized contracts lower the time and effort involved in arrang-
ing swaps, and this lowers transactions costs. (2) The development of standardized
contracts has led to a secondary market for swaps, which has increased the liquidity
and efficiency of the swaps market. A number of international banks now make
markets in swaps and offer quotes on several standard types. Also, as noted previ-
ously, the banks now take counterparty positions in swaps, so it is not necessary to
find another firm with mirror-image needs before a swap transaction can be com-
pleted. The bank would generally find a final counterparty for the swap at a later
date, so its positioning helps make the swap market more operationally efficient.
To further illustrate a swap transaction, consider the following situation. An elec-
tric utility recently issued a 5-year floating-rate note tied to the prime rate. The
prime rate could rise significantly over the period, so the note carries a high degree
of interest rate risk. The utility could, however, enter into a swap with a counterparty
(say, Citibank) in which the utility would pay Citibank a fixed series of interest pay-
ments over the 5-year period and Citibank would make the company’s required
floating-rate payments. As a result, the utility would have converted a floating-rate
loan to a fixed-rate loan, and the risk of rising interest rates would have been passed
from the utility to Citibank. Such a transaction can lower both parties’ risks—because
banks’ revenues rise as interest rates rise, Citibank’s risk would actually be lower if it
had floating-rate obligations.
Longer-term swaps can also be made. For example, Citibank entered into a 17-year
swap in an electricity cogeneration project financing deal. The project’s sponsors were
unable to obtain fixed-rate financing on reasonable terms, and they were afraid interest
rates would increase and make the project unprofitable. However, the project’s spon-
sors were able to borrow from local banks on a floating-rate basis and then arrange a
simultaneous swap with Citibank for a fixed-rate obligation.
Credit default swaps (CDS) are called swaps but are actually more like insurance.
An investor might purchase a CDS by making an annual payment to a counterparty
to insure a particular bond against default (it is not necessary that the purchaser actu-
ally own the bond); if the bond defaults, the counterparty pays the purchaser the
amount of the defaulted bond that was insured.
When banks and other major financial institutions take positions in swaps and
CDS, they are themselves exposed to various risks, especially if their counterparties
cannot meet their obligations. Furthermore, swaps are off–balance sheet transactions,
making it impossible to tell just how large the swap market is or who has what obli-
gation. Well before 2007, academics had speculated that the size of the swap markets,
the interconnectedness of so many financial institutions through the swap markets,
and the overall lack of transparency made for a volatile mix capable of disrupting
922
Part 9: Special Topics

the entire global financial system. These worries were confirmed in 2007 and 2008
when mortgage-backed securities began defaulting and counterparties for CDS, like
AIG, could not cover their obligations. Congress, the Federal Reserve, and the Trea-
sury are currently (August 2009) debating how the swap markets should be regulated
to prevent future meltdowns.
Commodity Price Exposure
As we noted earlier, futures markets were established for many commodities long be-
fore they began to be used as financial instruments. We can use Porter Electronics,
which uses large quantities of copper as well as several precious metals, to illustrate
inventory hedging. Suppose that in May 2010, Porter foresaw a need for 100,000
pounds of copper in March 2011 for use in fulfilling a fixed-price contract to supply
solar power cells to the U.S. government. Porter’s managers are concerned that a
strike by Chilean copper miners will occur, which could raise the price of copper in
world markets and possibly turn the expected profit into a loss.
Porter could, of course, go ahead and buy the copper it will need to fulfill the con-
tract, but doing so will incur substantial carrying costs. As an alternative, the com-
pany could hedge against increasing copper prices in the futures market. The New
York Commodity Exchange trades standard copper futures contracts of 25,000
pounds each. Thus, Porter could buy four contracts (go long) for delivery in March
2011. Assume these contracts were trading in May for about $1.00 per pound and
that the spot price at that date was about $1.02 per pound. If copper prices do rise
appreciably over the next 10 months then the value of Porter’s long position in cop-
per futures would increase, thus offsetting some of the price increase in the commod-
ity itself. Of course, if copper prices fall then Porter would lose money on its futures
contracts, but the company would be buying the copper on the spot market at a
cheaper price, so it would make a higher than anticipated profit on its sale of solar
cells. Thus, hedging in the copper futures market locks in the cost of raw materials
and removes some risk to which the firm would otherwise be exposed.
Many other companies, such as Alcoa with aluminum and Archer Daniels Midland
with grains, routinely use the futures markets to reduce the risks associated with price
volatility.
The Use and Misuse of Derivatives
Most of the news stories about derivatives are related to financial disasters. Much less is
heard about the benefits of derivatives. However, because of these benefits, more than
83% of large U.S. companies use derivatives on a regular basis. In today’s market, sophis-
ticated investors and analysts are demanding that firms use derivatives to hedge certain
risks. For example, Compaq Computer (now a part of Hewlett-Packard) was sued by a
shareholder group for failing to properly hedge its foreign exchange exposure. The share-
holders lost the suit, but Compaq got the message and now uses currency futures
to hedge its international operations. In another example, Prudential Securities reduced
its earnings estimate for Cone Mills, a North Carolina textile company, because Cone
did not sufficiently hedge its exposure to changing cotton prices. These examples lead to
one conclusion: If a company can safely and inexpensively hedge its risks, it should do so.
There can, however, be a downside to the use of derivatives. Hedging is invari-
ably cited by authorities as a “good” use of derivatives, whereas speculating with
derivatives is often cited as a “bad” use. Some people and organizations can afford
to bear the risks involved in speculating with derivatives, but others are either not
sufficiently knowledgeable about the risks or else should not be taking those risks
Chapter 23: Derivatives and Risk Management
923

in the first place. Most would agree that the typical corporation should use deriva-
tives only to hedge risks, not to speculate in an effort to increase profits. Hedging
allows a manager to concentrate on running his core business without having to
worry about interest rate, currency, and commodity price variability. However,
big problems can arise if hedges are improperly constructed or if a corporate trea-
surer, eager to report relatively high returns, uses derivatives for speculative
purposes.
One interesting example of a derivatives debacle involved Kashima Oil, a Japanese
firm that imports oil. It pays with U.S. dollars but then sells oil in the Japanese mar-
ket for yen. Kashima began by using currency futures to hedge, but it later started to
speculate on dollar–yen price movements, hoping to increase profits. When the cur-
rency markets moved against Kashima’s speculative position, lax accounting rules
permitted it to avoid reporting the losses by simply rolling over the contract. By the
time Kashima bit the bullet and closed its position, it had lost $1.5 billion. Other
companies have experienced similar problems.
Our belief is that derivatives can and should be used to hedge against certain risks
but that the leverage inherent in derivatives contracts makes them potentially danger-
ous. Also, CFOs, CEOs, and board members should be reasonably knowledgeable
about the derivatives their firms use, should establish policies regarding when they
can and cannot be used, and should establish audit procedures to ensure that the pol-
icies are carried out. Moreover, a firm’s derivatives position should be reported to
stockholders, because stockholders have a right to know when situations such as the
one involving Kashima might arise.

Summary
Companies every day face a variety of risks, for it is hard to operate a successful busi-
ness without taking some chances. Back in Chapter 6, we discussed the trade-off
between risk and return. If some action can lower risk without lowering returns too
much, then the action can enhance value. With this in mind, we described in this
chapter the various types of risks that companies face, and we discussed the basic
principles of corporate risk management. One important tool for managing risk is
the derivatives market. Consequently, this chapter has also provided an introduction
to derivative securities. The key concepts covered are listed below.
•
There are several reasons risk management might increase the value of a firm.
Risk management allows corporations (1) to increase their use of debt, (2) to
maintain their capital budget over time, (3) to avoid costs associated with
financial distress, (4) to utilize their comparative advantages in hedging
relative to the hedging ability of individual investors, (5) to reduce both the risks
924
Part 9: Special Topics

and costs of borrowing by using swaps, and (6) to reduce the higher taxes that
result from fluctuating earnings. Managers may also want to stabilize earnings in
order to boost their own compensation.
•
A derivative is a security whose value is determined by the market price or
interest rate of some other security.
•
A hedge is a transaction that lowers risk. A natural hedge is a transaction
between two counterparties whose risks are mirror images of each other.
•
A futures contract is a standardized contract that is traded on an exchange and
is marked-to-market daily, although physical delivery of the underlying asset
usually does not occur.
•
Under a forward contract, one party agrees to buy a commodity at a specific
price and a specific future date and the other party agrees to make the sale;
delivery does occur.
•
A structured note is a debt obligation derived from another debt obligation.
•
A swap is an exchange of cash payment obligations. Swaps occur because the
parties involved prefer the other’s payment stream.
•
In general, risk management involves the management of unpredictable events
that have adverse consequences for the firm.
•
The three key steps in risk management are as follows: (1) identify the risks
faced by the company, (2) measure the potential impacts of these risks, and
(3) decide how each relevant risk should be dealt with.
•
In most situations, risk exposure can be dealt with by one or more of the
following techniques: (1) transfer the risk to an insurance company, (2)
transfer the function that produces the risk to a third party, (3) purchase a
derivative contract, (4) reduce the probability of occurrence of an adverse
event, (5) reduce the magnitude of the loss associated with an adverse event,
and (6) totally avoid the activity that gives rise to the risk.
•
Financial futures permit firms to create hedge positions to protect themselves
against fluctuating interest rates, stock prices, and exchange rates.
•
Commodity futures can be used to hedge against input price increases.
•
Long hedges involve buying futures contracts to guard against price increases.
•
Short hedges involve selling futures contracts to guard against price declines.
•
A perfect hedge occurs when the gain or loss on the hedged transaction exactly
offsets the loss or gain on the unhedged position.

mericans love mutual funds. By 1985, they had invested about $495 billion in
mutual funds, which is not exactly chicken feed. By May 2009, however, they
had invested more than $10 trillion in mutual funds! Not only has the amount
of money invested in mutual funds skyrocketed, but the variety of funds is
astounding. You can buy funds that specialize in virtually any type of asset: funds
that specialize in stocks from a particular industry, a particular continent, or a
particular country. There are money market funds that invest only in Treasury bills
and other short-term securities, and there are even funds that hold municipal
bonds from a specific state.
For those with a social conscience, there are funds that refuse to own stocks
of companies that pollute, sell tobacco products, or have workforces that are not
culturally diverse. For others, there is the so-called Vice fund, which invests only
in brewers, defense contractors, tobacco companies, and the like.
You can also buy market-neutral funds, which sell some stocks short, invest in
others, and promise (perhaps falsely) to do well no matter which way the market
goes. There is the Undiscovered Managers Behavioral fund, which picks stocks by
psychoanalyzing Wall Street analysts. And then there is the Tombstone fund,
which owns stocks only from the funeral industry.
You can buy an index fund, which simply holds a portfolio of stocks in an index
such as the S&P 500 and doesn’t try to beat the market. Instead, index funds
strive for low expenses and pass the savings on to investors. An exchange
traded fund, or ETF, actually has its own stock that is traded on a stock
exchange. Different ETFs hold widely varied portfolios, ranging from the S&P 500
to gold mining companies to Middle Eastern oil companies, and their fees to long-
term investors are quite low. At the other extreme, hedge funds, which are pools
of money provided by institutions and wealthy individuals, are extremely actively
managed—even to the extent of taking over and then operationally managing
firms in the portfolio—and have relatively high expenses.
As you read this chapter, think about how portfolio theory, which became
widely understood about 30 years ago, has influenced the mutual fund industry.

In Chapter 6, we presented the key elements of risk and return analysis. There we saw
that much of a stock’s risk can be eliminated by diversification, so rational investors
should hold portfolios of stocks rather than shares of a single stock. We also intro-
duced the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which links risk and required rates
of return and uses a stock’s beta coefficient as the relevant measure of risk. In this
chapter, we extend these concepts and explain portfolio theory. We then present an
in-depth treatment of the CAPM, including a more detailed look at how betas are cal-
culated. We discuss two other asset pricing models, the Arbitrage Pricing Theory
model and the Fama-French three-factor model. Finally, we introduce a relatively
new but fast-growing field, behavioral finance.
24.1 EFFICIENT PORTFOLIOS
Recall from Chapter 6 the important role in portfolio risk that is played by the
correlation between assets. One important use of portfolio risk concepts is to select
efficient portfolios, defined as those portfolios that provide the highest expected
return for any degree of risk—or the lowest degree of risk for any expected return.
We begin with the two-asset case and then extend it to the general case of N assets.
The Two-Asset Case
Consider two assets, A and B. Suppose we have estimated the expected returns
(^rA and ^rB), the standard deviations (σA and σB) of returns, and the correlation coeffi-
cient (ρAB) for returns.1 The expected return and standard deviation (SD) for a portfolio
containing these two assets are
^rp ¼ wA^rA þ ð1 −wAÞ^rB

Here wA is the fraction of the portfolio invested in Security A, so (1 −wA) is the
fraction invested in Security B.
Corporate Valuation and Risk
In Chapter 1, we told you that managers should strive to
make their firms more valuable and that the value of a
firm is determined by the size, timing, and risk of its
free cash flows (FCF). In Chapter 6, we discussed risk,
which affects WACC and value. Now we provide addi-
tional insights into how to manage a portfolio’s risk and
measure a firm’s risk.

Part 10: Advanced Issues

To illustrate, suppose we can allocate our funds between A and B in any propor-
tion. Suppose Security A has an expected rate of return of ^rA = 5% and a standard
deviation of returns of σA = 4%, while ^rB = 8% and σB = 10%. Our first task is to
determine the set of attainable portfolios and then, from this attainable set, to select
the efficient subset.
To construct the attainable set, we need data on the degree of correlation between
the two securities’ expected returns, ρAB. Let us work with three different assumed
degrees of correlation—namely, ρAB = +1.0, ρAB = 0, and ρAB = −1.0—and use them
to develop the portfolios’ expected returns, ^rp, and standard deviations, σp. (Of
course, only one correlation can exist; our example simply shows three alternative
situations that could occur.)
To calculate ^rp, we use Equation 24-1: Substitute the given values for ^rA and
^rB, and then calculate ^rp for different values of wA. For example, if wA = 0.75,
then ^rp = 5.75%:
^rp ¼ wA^rA þ ð1 −wAÞ^rB
¼ 0:75ð5%Þ þ 0:25ð8%Þ ¼ 5:75%
Other values of ^rp are found similarly and are shown in the third column of
Table 24-1.
Next, we use Equation 24-2 to find σp. Substitute the given values for σA, σB, and
ρAB, and then calculate σp for different values of wA. For example, if ρAB = 0 and
wA = 0.75, then σp = 3.9%:

Table 24-1 gives ^rp and σp values for wA = 1.00, 0.75, 0.50, 0.25, and 0.00, and
Figure 24-1 plots ^rp, σp, and the attainable set of portfolios for each correlation. In
both the table and the graphs, note the following points.
1. The three graphs across the top row of Figure 24-1 designate Case I, where the
two assets are perfectly positively correlated; that is, ρAB = +1.0. The three graphs
in the middle row are for the case of zero correlation, and the three in the
bottom row are for perfect negative correlation.

2. We rarely encounter ρAB = −1.0, 0.0, or +1.0. Generally, ρAB is in the range of +0.5
to +0.7 for most stocks. Case II (zero correlation) produces graphs that, pictorially,
most closely resemble real-world examples.
3. The left column of graphs shows how the expected portfolio returns vary with dif-
ferent combinations of A and B. We see that these graphs are identical in each of
the three cases: The portfolio return, ^rp, is a linear function of wA, and it does
not depend on the correlation coefficients. This is also seen from the ^rp column
in Table 24-1.
4. The middle column of graphs shows how risk is affected by the portfolio mix.
Starting from the top, we see that portfolio risk, σp, increases linearly in Case I,
where ρAB = +1.0; it is nonlinear in Case II; and Case III shows that risk can be
completely diversified away if ρAB = −1.0. Thus σp, unlike ^rp, does depend on
correlation.
5. Note that in both Cases II and III, but not in Case I, someone holding only
Stock A could sell some A and buy some B, thus increasing expected return and
lowering risk as well.
6. The right column of graphs shows the attainable, or feasible, set of portfolios
constructed with different mixes of Securities A and B. Unlike the other columns,
which plotted return and risk versus the portfolio’s composition, each of these
three graphs was plotted from pairs of ^rp and σp as shown in Table 24-1. For
example, Point A in the upper right graph is the point ^rp = 5%, σp = 4% from the
Case I data. All other points on the curves were plotted similarly. With only two

securities in the portfolio, the attainable set is a curve or line, and we can achieve
each risk/return combination on the relevant curve by some allocation of our in-
vestment funds between Securities A and B.
7. Are all combinations on the attainable set equally good? The answer is “no.” Only
that part of the attainable set from Y to B in Cases II and III is defined as efficient.
The part from A to Y is inefficient because, for any degree of risk on the line seg-
ment AY, a higher return can be found on segment YB. Thus, no rational investor
would hold a portfolio that lies on segment AY. In Case I, however, the entire
feasible set is efficient—no combination of the securities can be ruled out.
From these examples we see that in one extreme case (ρ = −1.0), risk can be
completely eliminated, while in the other extreme case (ρ = +1.0), diversification
does no good whatsoever. In between these extremes, combining two stocks into a
portfolio reduces but does not eliminate the risk inherent in the individual stocks. If
we differentiate Equation 24-2, set the derivative equal to zero, and then solve for
wA, we obtain the fraction of the portfolio that should be invested in Security A if
we wish to form the least-risky portfolio. Here is the equation:
Minimum risk portfolio: wA ¼
σBðσB −ρABσAÞ
σ2
A þ σ2
B −2ρABσAσB
(24-3)
As a rule, we limit wA to the range 0 to +1.0; that is, if the solution value is wA > 1.0,
set wA = 1.0, and if wA is negative, set wA = 0.0. A wA value that is negative means that
Security A is sold short; if wA is positive, B is sold short. In a short sale, you borrow a
stock and then sell it, expecting to buy it back later (at a lower price) in order to repay
the person from whom the stock was borrowed. If you sell short and the stock price
rises then you lose, but you win if the price declines.
The N-Asset Case
The same principles from the two-asset case also apply when the portfolio is com-
posed of N assets. Here is the notation for the N-asset case: The percentage of the
investment in asset i (the portfolio weight) is wi, the expected return for asset i is ^ri,
the standard deviation of asset i is σi, and the correlation between asset i and asset j is
ρij. The expected return for a portfolio with N assets is then

(24-4)
and the variance of the portfolio is
σ2
p¼ ∑

(24-5)
For the case in which i = j, the correlation is ρij = ρii = 1. Notice also that when i = j,
the product σiσj ¼ σiσi ¼ σ2
i .
One way to apply Equation 24-5 is to set up a table with a row and column for
each asset. Give the rows and columns labels showing the assets’ weights and stan-
dard deviations. Then fill in each cell in the table by multiplying the values in the
row and column headings by the correlation between the assets, as shown below:

What is meant by the term “attainable set”?
Within the attainable set, which portfolios are “efficient”?
Stock A has an expected return of 10% and a standard deviation of 35%. Stock B has
an expected return of 15% and a standard deviation of 45%. The correlation coeffi-
cient between Stock A and B is 0.3. What are the expected return and standard devi-
ation of a portfolio invested 60% in Stock A and 40% in Stock B? (12.0%; 31.5%)
24.2 CHOOSING THE OPTIMAL PORTFOLIO
With only two assets, the feasible set of portfolios is a line or curve as shown in the
third column of graphs in Figure 24-1. However, by increasing the number of assets
we obtain an area, such as the shaded region in Figure 24-2. The points A, H, G, and
E represent single securities (or portfolios containing only one security). All the other
points in the shaded area and its boundaries, which comprise the feasible set, repre-
sent portfolios of two or more securities. Each point in this area represents a particu-
lar portfolio with a risk of σp and an expected return of ^rp. For example, point X
represents one such portfolio’s risk and expected return, as do each of points B, C,
and D.
Given the full set of potential portfolios that could be constructed from the avail-
able assets, which portfolio should actually be held? This choice involves two separate
decisions: (1) determining the efficient set of portfolios and (2) choosing from the
efficient set the single portfolio that is best for the specific investor.
The Efficient Frontier
In Figure 24-2, the boundary line BCDE defines the efficient set of portfolios, which
is also called the efficient frontier.2 Portfolios to the left of the efficient set are not
possible because they lie outside the attainable set. Portfolios to the right of the
boundary line (interior portfolios) are inefficient because some other portfolio would
2A computational procedure for determining the efficient set of portfolios was developed by Harry Mar-
kowitz and first reported in his article “Portfolio Selection,” Journal of Finance, March 1952, pp. 77–91. In
this article, Markowitz developed the basic concepts of portfolio theory, and he later won the Nobel Prize
in economics for his work.
936
Part 10: Advanced Issues

provide either a higher return for the same degree of risk or a lower risk for the same
rate of return. For example, Portfolio X is dominated in this sense by all portfolios on
the curve CD.
Risk–Return Indifference Curves
Given the efficient set of portfolios, which specific portfolio should an investor
choose? To determine the optimal portfolio for a particular investor, we must know
the investor’s attitude toward risk as reflected in his or her risk–return trade-off func-
tion, or indifference curve.
An investor’s risk–return trade-off function is based on the standard economic
concepts of utility theory and indifference curves, which are illustrated in Figure 24-3.
The curves labeled IY and IZ represent the indifference curves of Individuals Y and Z.
Ms. Y’s curve indicates indifference between the riskless 5% portfolio, a portfolio
with an expected return of 6% but a risk of σp = 1.4%, and so on. Mr. Z’s curve indi-
cates indifference between a riskless 5% return, an expected 6% return with risk of
σp = 3.3%, and so on.
Note that Ms. Y requires a higher expected rate of return as compensation for any
given amount of risk; thus, Ms. Y is said to be more risk averse than Mr. Z. Her
higher risk aversion causes Ms. Y to require a higher risk premium—defined here
as the difference between the 5% riskless return and the expected return required
to compensate for any specific amount of risk—than Mr. Z requires. Thus, Ms. Y
requires a risk premium (RPY) of 2.5% to compensate for a risk of σp = 3.3%,
whereas Mr. Z’s risk premium for this degree of risk is only RPZ = 1.0%. As a gener-
alization, the steeper the slope of an investor’s indifference curve, the more risk averse the
investor. Thus, Ms. Y is more risk averse than Mr. Z.
Each individual has a “map” of indifference curves; the indifference maps for Ms.
Y and Mr. Z are shown in Figure 24-4. The higher curves denote a greater level of
satisfaction (or utility). Thus, IZ2 is better than IZ1 because, for any level of risk, Mr.
Z has a higher expected return and hence greater utility. An infinite number of indif-
ference curves could be drawn in the map for each individual, and each individual has
a unique map.

The Optimal Portfolio for an Investor
Figure 24-4 also shows the feasible set of portfolios for the two-asset case, under the
assumption that ρAB = 0, as it was developed in Figure 24-1. The optimal portfolio
for each investor is found at the tangency point between the efficient set of portfolios
and one of the investor’s indifference curves. This tangency point marks the highest
level of satisfaction the investor can attain. Ms. Y, who is more risk averse than Mr.
Z, chooses a portfolio with a lower expected return (about 6%) but a risk of only σp =
4.2%. Mr. Z picks a portfolio that provides an expected return of about 7.2% but has
a risk of about σp = 7.1%. Ms. Y’s portfolio is more heavily weighted with the less
risky security, while Mr. Z’s portfolio contains a larger proportion of the more risky
security.3

3Ms. Y’s portfolio would contain 67% of Security A and 33% of Security B, whereas Mr. Z’s portfolio
would consist of 27% of Security A and 73% of Security B. These percentages can be determined with
Equation 24-1 by simply seeing what percentage of the two securities is consistent with r^p = 6.0% and
7.2%. For example, wA(5%) + (1 −wA)(8%) = 7.2%, and solving for wA, we obtain wA = 0.27 and
(1 −wA) = 0.73.

24.3 THE BASIC ASSUMPTIONS OF THE CAPITAL ASSET
PRICING MODEL
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which was introduced in Chapter 6,
specifies the relationship between risk and required rates of return on assets when
they are held in well-diversified portfolios. The assumptions underlying the CAPM’s
development are summarized in the following list.4
1. All investors focus on a single holding period, and they seek to maximize
the expected utility of their terminal wealth by choosing among alternative
portfolios on the basis of each portfolio’s expected return and standard
deviation.

ket Equilibrium under Conditions of Risk,” Journal of Finance, September 1964, pp. 425–442. Professor
Sharpe won the Nobel Prize in economics for his work on capital asset pricing. The assumptions inherent
in Sharpe’s model were spelled out by Michael C. Jensen in “Capital Markets: Theory and Evidence,” Bell
Journal of Economics and Management Science, Autumn 1972, pp. 357–398.

2. All investors can borrow or lend an unlimited amount at a given risk-free rate of
interest, rRF, and there are no restrictions on short sales of any asset.
3. All investors have identical estimates of the expected returns, variances, and cov-
ariances among all assets (that is, investors have homogeneous expectations).
4. All assets are perfectly divisible and perfectly liquid (that is, marketable at the
going price).
5. There are no transaction costs.
6. There are no taxes.
7. All investors are price takers (that is, all investors assume that their own buying
and selling activity will not affect stock prices).
8. The quantities of all assets are given and fixed.
Theoretical extensions in the literature have relaxed some of these assumptions,
and in general these extensions have led to conclusions that are reasonably consistent
with the basic theory. However, the validity of any model can be established only
through empirical tests, which we discuss later in the chapter.

24.4 THE CAPITAL MARKET LINE AND THE SECURITY
MARKET LINE
Figure 24-4 showed the set of portfolio opportunities for the two-asset case, and it
illustrated how indifference curves can be used to select the optimal portfolio from
the feasible set. In Figure 24-5, we show a similar diagram for the many-asset case,

but here we also include a risk-free asset with a return rRF. The riskless asset by defi-
nition has zero risk, σ = 0%, so it is plotted on the vertical axis.
The figure shows both the feasible set of portfolios of risky assets (the shaded
area) and a set of indifference curves (I1, I2, I3) for a particular investor. Point N,
where indifference curve I1 is tangent to the efficient set, represents a possible port-
folio choice; it is the point on the efficient set of risky portfolios where the investor
obtains the highest possible return for a given amount of risk and the smallest degree
of risk for a given expected return.
However, the investor can do better than Portfolio N by reaching a higher indif-
ference curve. In addition to the feasible set of risky portfolios, we now have a risk-
free asset that provides a riskless return, rRF. Given the risk-free asset, investors can
create new portfolios that combine the risk-free asset with a portfolio of risky as-
sets. This enables them to achieve any combination of risk and return on the
straight line connecting rRF with M, the point of tangency between that straight
line and the efficient frontier of risky asset portfolios.5 Some portfolios on the line
rRFMZ will be preferred to most risky portfolios on the efficient frontier BNME,
so the points on the line rRFMZ now represent the best attainable combinations of
risk and return.
Given the new opportunities along line rRFMZ, our investor will move from Point
N to Point R, which is on her highest attainable risk–return indifference curve. Note
that any point on the old efficient frontier BNME (except the point of tangency M)
is dominated by some point along the line rRFMZ. In general, since investors can
purchase some of the risk-free security and some of the risky portfolio (M), it will
be possible to move to a point such as R. In addition, if the investor can borrow as
well as lend (lending is equivalent to buying risk-free debt securities) at the riskless
5The risk–return combinations between a risk-free asset and a risky asset (a single stock or a portfolio of
stocks) will always be linear. To see this, consider the following equations, which were developed earlier,
for return (^rp) and risk (σp) for any combination wRF and (1 −wRF):
^rp ¼ wRFrRF þ ð1 −wRFÞ^rM

Equation 24-1a is linear. As for Equation 24-2a, we know that r is the risk-free asset, so σRF = 0; hence,
σ2
RF is also zero. Using this information, we can simplify Equation 24-2a as follows:

Thus, σp is also linear when a riskless asset is combined with a portfolio of risky assets.
If expected returns, as measured by ^rp, and risk, as measured by σp, are both linear functions of wRF,
then the relationship between ^rp and σp, when graphed as in Figure 24-5, must also be linear. For exam-
ple, if 100% of the portfolio is invested in rRF with a return of 8%, then the portfolio return will be 8%
and σp will be 0. If 100% is invested in M with rM = 12% and σM = 10%, then σp = 1.0(10%) = 10% and
^rp = 0(8%) + 1.0(12%) = 12%. If 50% of the portfolio is invested in M and 50% in the risk-free asset, then
σp = 0.5(10%) = 5% and ^rp = 0.5(8%) + 0.5(12%) = 10%. Plotting these points will reveal the linear rela-
tionship given as rRFMZ in Figure 24-5.

rate rRF, then it is possible to move out on the line segment MZ; an investor would
do so if his indifference curve were tangent to rRFMZ, to the right of Point M.6
All investors should hold portfolios lying on the line rRFMZ under the conditions
assumed in the CAPM. This implies that they should hold portfolios that are combina-
tions of the risk-free security and the risky Portfolio M. Thus, the addition of the risk-
free asset totally changes the efficient set: The efficient set now lies along line rRFMZ
rather than along the curve BNME. Note also that if the capital market is to be in equi-
librium, then M must be a portfolio that contains every risky asset in exact proportion to
that asset’s fraction of the total market value of all assets. In other words, if Security i is X
percent of the total market value of all securities, then X percent of the market portfolio
M must consist of Security i. (That is, M is the market value–weighted portfolio of all
risky assets in the economy.) Thus, all investors should hold portfolios that lie on the
line rRF MZ, with the particular location of a given individual’s portfolio being deter-
mined by the point at which his indifference curve is tangent to the line.
The line rRFMZ in Figure 24-5 is called the Capital Market Line (CML). It has
an intercept of rRF and a slope of (^rM −rRF)/σM.7 Therefore, the equation for the Cap-
ital Market Line may be expressed as follows:
CML: ^rp ¼ rRF þ
^rM −rRF
σM


σp
(24-6)
The expected rate of return on an efficient portfolio is equal to the riskless rate plus a
risk premium that is equal to (^rM −rRF)/σM multiplied by the portfolio’s standard
deviation, σp. Thus, the CML specifies a linear relationship between an efficient
portfolio’s expected return and risk, where the slope of the CML is equal to the
expected return on the market portfolio of risky stocks (^rM) minus the risk-free rate
(rRF), which is called the market risk premium, all divided by the standard deviation
of returns on the market portfolio, σM:
Slope of the CML ¼ ð^rM −rRFÞ=σM
For example, suppose rRF = 10%, ^rM = 15%, and σM = 15%. In this case, the slope
of the CML would be (15% −10%)/15% = 0.33, and if a particular efficient portfolio
had σp = 10% then its ^rp would be
^rp ¼ 10% þ 0:33ð10%Þ ¼ 13:3%
A (riskier) portfolio with σp = 20% would have ^rp = 10% + 0.33(20%) = 16.6%.
The CML is graphed in Figure 24-6. It is a straight line with an intercept at rRF
and a slope equal to the market risk premium (rM −rRF) divided by σM. The slope of
the CML reflects the aggregate attitude of investors toward risk.
6An investor who is highly averse to risk will have a steep indifference curve and will end up holding only
the riskless asset or perhaps a portfolio at a point such as R (i.e., holding some of the risky market portfo-
lio and some of the riskless asset). An investor who is only slightly averse to risk will have a relatively flat
indifference curve, which will cause her to move out beyond M toward Z, borrowing to do so. This inves-
tor might buy stocks on margin, which means borrowing and using the stocks as collateral. If individuals’
borrowing rates are higher than rRF, then the line rRFMZ will tilt down (i.e., be less steep) beyond M.
This condition would invalidate the basic CAPM or at least require that it be modified. Therefore, the as-
sumption of being able to borrow or lend at the same rate is crucial to CAPM theory.
7Recall that the slope of any line is measured as ∆Y/∆X, or the change in height associated with a given change in
horizontal distance. Here rRF is at 0 on the horizontal axis, so ∆X = σM −0 = σM. The vertical axis difference
associated with a change from rRF to ^rM is ^rM −rRF. Therefore, slope = ∆Y/∆X = (^rM−rRF)/ σM.

Part 10: Advanced Issues

Recall that an efficient portfolio is one that is well diversified; hence all of its
unsystematic risk has been eliminated and its only remaining risk is market risk.
Therefore, unlike individual stocks, the risk of an efficient portfolio is measured by
its standard deviation, σp. The CML equation specifies the relationship between
risk and return for such efficient portfolios—that is, for portfolios that lie on the
CML—and in the CML equation and graph, risk is measured by portfolio standard
deviation.
The CML specifies the relationship between risk and return for an efficient
portfolio, but investors and managers are more concerned about the relationship
between risk and return for individual assets. To develop the risk–return relation-
ship for individual securities, note in Figure 24-5 that all investors are assumed to
hold Portfolio M, so M must be the market portfolio (i.e., the one that contains
all stocks). Note also that M is an efficient portfolio. Thus, the CML defines the
relationship between the market portfolio’s expected return and its standard devi-
ation. Equations 24-4 and 24-5 show the formulas for the expected return and
standard deviation for a multi-asset portfolio, including the market portfolio. It
is possible to take the equations for the expected return and standard deviation
of a multi-asset portfolio and show that the required return for each individual
Stock i must conform to the following equation in order for the CML to hold
for the market portfolio:8

Recall that the risk premium for the market, RPM, is rM −rRF. Using this defini-
tion and substituting Equation 24-8 into Equation 24-7 gives the Security Market
Line (SML):
SML: ri ¼ rRF þ ðrM −rRFÞbi
¼ rRF þ ðRPMÞbi
(24-9)
The SML tells us that an individual stock’s required return is equal to the risk-free
rate plus a premium for bearing risk. The premium for risk is equal to the risk pre-
mium for the market, RPM, multiplied by the risk of the individual stock, as mea-
sured by its beta coefficient. The beta coefficient measures the amount of risk that
the stock contributes to the market portfolio.
Unlike the CML for a well-diversified portfolio, the SML tells us that the stan-
dard deviation (σi) of an individual stock should not be used to measure its risk,
because some of the risk as reflected by σi can be eliminated by diversification. Beta
reflects risk after taking diversification benefits into account and so beta, rather than
σi, is used to measure individual stocks’ risks to investors. Be sure to keep in mind the
distinction between the SML and the CML and why that distinction exists.

24.5 CALCULATING BETA COEFFICIENTS
Equation 24-8 defines beta, but recall from Chapter 6 that this equation for beta
is also the formula for the slope coefficient in a regression of the stock return
against the market return. Therefore, beta can be calculated by plotting the his-
torical returns of a stock on the y-axis of a graph versus the historical returns
of the market portfolio on the x-axis and then fitting the regression line. In
his 1964 article that set forth the CAPM, Sharpe called this regression line the
characteristic line. Thus, a stock’s beta is the slope of its characteristic line.
In Chapter 6, we used this approach to calculate the beta for General Electric.
In this chapter, we perform a more detailed analysis of the calculation of beta
for General Electric, and we also perform a similar analysis for a portfolio of
stocks, Fidelity’s Magellan Fund.

Table 24-2 shows a summary of the data used in this analysis; the full data set is in
the file Ch24 Tool Kit.xls and has monthly returns for the 4-year period April 2005–
March 2009. Table 24-2 shows the market returns (defined as the percentage price
change of the S&P 500), the stock returns for GE, and the returns on the Magellan
Fund (which is a well-diversified portfolio). The table also shows the risk-free rate,
defined as the rate on a short-term (3-month) U.S. Treasury bill, which we will use
later in this analysis.
As Table 24-2 shows, GE had an average annual return of −22.9% during this
4-year period, while the market had an average annual return of −8.5%. As we noted
before, it is usually unreasonable to think that the future expected return for a stock
will equal its average historical return over a relatively short period, such as 4 years.
However, we might well expect past volatility to be a reasonable estimate of future
volatility, at least during the next couple of years. Observe that the standard deviation
for GE’s return during this period was 28.9%, versus 15.9% for the market. Thus,
the market’s volatility is less than that of GE. This is what we would expect, since
the market is a well-diversified portfolio and thus much of its risk has been diversi-
fied away. The correlation between GE’s stock returns and the market returns is
about 0.76, which is a little higher than the correlation for a typical stock.
Skill or Luck?
That’s the question The Wall Street Journal’s Invest-
ment Dartboard Contest sought to answer by compar-
ing
the
actual
investment
results
of
professional
analysts against amateurs and dart throwers. Here’s
how the contest worked. First, The Wall Street Journal
(WSJ) picked four professional analysts, and each of
those pros formed a portfolio by picking four stocks.
Second, amateurs could enter the contest by e-mailing
their pick of a single stock to the WSJ, which then
picked four amateurs at random and combined their
choices to make a four-stock portfolio. Third, a group
of WSJ editors formed a portfolio by throwing four
darts at the stock tables. At the beginning of each con-
test, the WSJ announced the six resulting portfolios,
and at the end of six months, the paper announced
the results. The top two pros were invited back for the
next contest.
Since 1990 there have been 142 completed contests.
The pros beat the darts 87 times and lost 55 times. The
pros also beat the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 54%
of the contests. The pros had an average 6-month port-
folio return of 10.2%, much higher than either the DJIA
6-month average of 5.6% or the darts’ return of only
3.5%. The readers, meantime, lost an average of 4%
versus a same-period (30 contests) gain of 7.2% for
the pros.
Do these results mean that skill is more important
than luck when it comes to investing in stocks? Not nec-
essarily, according to Burton Malkiel, an economics
professor at Princeton and the author of the widely
read book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street. Since the
dart-selected portfolios consist of randomly chosen
stocks, they should have average risk. However, the
pros consistently picked high-risk stocks. Because there
was a bull market during most of the contest, one
would expect high-risk stocks to outperform the aver-
age stock. According to Malkiel, the pros’ performance
could be due as much to a rising market as to superior
analytical skills. The WSJ discontinued that contest in
2002, so we can’t know for sure whether Malkiel was
right or wrong.
The WSJ now runs a new contest, pitting six amateurs
against six darts. In the recently completed Contest
No. 29, the readers averaged a 24% loss versus the darts’
9.4% loss (the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down
12%). Overall, readers have won 11 contests and the darts
have won 18. If you would like to enter the contest, e-mail
your stock pick to sundaydartboard@wsj.com.

Figure 24-7 shows a plot of GE’s returns against the market’s returns. We used the
Excel regression analysis feature to estimate the regression. Table 24-3 reports some of
the regression results for GE. Its estimated beta, which is the slope coefficient, is about
1.37. As with all regression results, 1.37 is just an estimate of beta, not necessarily the true
value of beta. Table 24-3 also shows the t-statistic and the probability that the true beta is
zero. For GE, this probability is approximately equal to zero. This means that there is
virtually a zero chance that the true beta is equal to zero. Since this probability is less than
5%, statisticians would say that the slope coefficient, beta, is “statistically significant.”
The output of the regression analysis also gives us the 95% confidence interval for the
estimate of beta. For GE, the results tell us that we can be 95% confident that the true
beta is between 1.02 and 1.73. This is an extremely wide range, but it is typical for most
individual stocks. Therefore, the regression estimate for the beta of any single company
is highly uncertain.

Observe also that the points in Figure 24-7 are not clustered very tightly around
the regression line. Sometimes GE does much better than the market; other times it
does much worse. The R2 value shown in the chart measures the degree of dispersion
about the regression line. Statistically speaking, it measures the percentage of vari-
ance that is explained by the regression equation. An R2 of 1.0 indicates that all
points lie exactly on the line; in this case, all of the variance in the y variable is
explained by the x variable. The R2 for GE is about 0.57, which is typical for most
individual stocks. This indicates that about 57% of the variance in GE’s returns is
explained by the overall market return.
Finally, note that the intercept shown in the regression equation displayed on the
chart is about −0.0094. Since the regression equation is based on monthly data, this
means that GE had a −11.28% average annual return that was not explained by the
CAPM model. However, the regression results in Table 24-3 also show that the
probability of the t-statistic is greater than 5%, meaning that the “true” intercept
might be zero. Therefore, most statisticians would say that this intercept is not statis-
tically significant—the returns of GE are so volatile that we cannot be sure that the
true intercept is not equal to zero. Translating statistician-speak into plain English,
this means that the part of GE’s average monthly return that is not explained by the
CAPM could, in fact, be zero. Thus, the CAPM might very well explain all of GE’s
average monthly returns.

bi ¼ Slope; or beta coefficient; for Stock i:

Equation 24-10 is called the market model, because it regresses the stock’s return
against the market’s return. However, the SML of the CAPM for realized returns is a
little different from Equation 24-10:
SML for realized returns: ¯ri;t ¼ ¯rRF;t þ bið¯rM;t −¯rRF;tÞ þ ei;t
(24-11)
where ¯rRF,t is the historical (realized) risk-free rate in period t.
In order to use the CAPM to estimate beta, we must rewrite Equation 24-11 as a
regression equation by adding an intercept, ai. The result is
ð¯ri −¯rRF;tÞ ¼ ai þ bið¯rM;t −¯rRF;tÞ þ ei;t
(24-12)
Therefore, to be theoretically correct when estimating beta, we should use the
stock’s return in excess of the risk-free rate as the y variable and use the market’s
return in excess of the risk-free rate as the x variable. We did this for GE using the
data in Table 24-2, and the results were reported in Panel c of Table 24-3. Note that
there are no appreciable differences between the results in Panel a, the market model,
and in Panel c, the CAPM model. This typically is the case, so we will use the market
model in the rest of the book.
Calculating the Beta Coefficient for a Portfolio:
The Magellan Fund
Let’s calculate beta for the Magellan Fund, which is a well-diversified portfolio.
Figure 24-8 shows the plot of Magellan’s monthly returns versus the market’s
monthly returns. Note the differences between this chart and the one for GE
shown in Figure 24-7. The points for Magellan are tightly clustered around the
regression line, indicating that the vast majority of Magellan’s variability is
explained by the stock market. The R2 of over 0.88 confirms this visual conclusion.
We can also see from Table 24-2 that the Magellan Fund has a standard deviation
of 21.1%, which is higher than the 15.9% standard deviation of the market.
As Table 24-3 shows, the estimated beta is 1.24 and the 95% confidence interval is
from 1.10 to 1.38, which is much tighter than the one for GE. The intercept is vir-
tually zero, and the probability of the intercept’s t-statistic is greater than 5%. There-
fore, the intercept is statistically insignificant, indicating that the CAPM explains the
average monthly return of the Magellan Fund very well.
Mutual fund managers are often evaluated by their risk-adjusted performance.
The three most widely used measures are Jensen’s alpha, Sharpe’s reward-to-variability
ratio, and Treynor’s reward-to-volatility ratio. Jensen’s alpha, which is the intercept in
a CAPM regression of excess returns, is 4.32% per year for Magellan, which seems to
948
Part 10: Advanced Issues

indicate that the Magellan fund had slightly superior performance. However, this
intercept was not statistically significantly different from zero. Its t-statistic is 1.13,
which is so low a value that it could happen about 26% of the time by chance even
if the intercept were truly zero. When this probability is greater than 5%, as is the
case for Magellan, then most statisticians would be reluctant to conclude that Magel-
lan’s estimated excess return of 4.32% is not actually equal to zero.
Sharpe’s reward-to-variability ratio is defined as the portfolio’s average return
(in excess of the risk-free rate) divided by its standard deviation. Sharpe’s ratio for
Magellan during the past 4 years is −0.49, which is greater than the S&P’s measure
of −0.74; but neither is very large, since both the market and Magellan just barely
outperformed a risk-free investment over the period.
Treynor’s reward-to-volatility ratio is defined as the portfolio’s average return
(in excess of the risk-free rate) divided by its beta. For Magellan, this is −8.2%, which
is a little better than the S&P 500’s ratio of −11.7%. All in all, the Magellan fund
seems to have slightly outperformed the market, but perhaps not by a statistically sig-
nificant amount. Although it’s not clear whether Magellan “beat the market,” it did
dramatically reduce the risk faced by investors as compared with the risk inherent in
a randomly chosen individual stock.
Additional Insights into Risk and Return
The CAPM provides some additional insights into the relationship between risk and
return.
1. The relationship between a stock’s total risk, market risk, and diversifiable risk
can be expressed as follows:

2. If all the points in Figure 24-7 had plotted exactly on the regression line, then the
variance of the error term, σ2
ei, would have been zero and all of the stock’s total
risk would have been market risk. On the other hand, if the points were widely
scattered about the regression line then much of the stock’s total risk would be
diversifiable. The shares of a large, well-diversified mutual fund will plot very
close to the regression line.
3. Beta is a measure of relative market risk, but the actual market risk of Stock i is

i σ2
M. Market risk can also be expressed in standard deviation form, biσM. The
higher a stock’s beta, the higher its market risk. If beta were zero, the stock would
have no market risk; whereas if beta were 1.0, then the stock would be exactly as
risky as the market—assuming the stock is held in a diversified portfolio—and the
stock’s market risk would be σM.
Advanced Issues in Calculating Beta
Betas are generally estimated from the stock’s characteristic line by running a linear
regression between past returns on the stock in question and past returns on some
market index. We define betas developed in this manner as historical betas. How-
ever, in most situations, it is the future beta that is needed. This has led to the devel-
opment of two different types of betas: (1) adjusted betas and (2) fundamental betas.
Adjusted betas grew largely out of the work of Marshall E. Blume, who showed
that true betas tend to move toward 1.0 over time.9 Therefore, we can begin with a
firm’s pure historical statistical beta, make an adjustment for the expected future
movement toward 1.0, and produce an adjusted beta that will, on average, be a better
predictor of the future beta than the unadjusted historical beta would be. Value Line
publishes betas based on approximately this formula:
Adjusted beta ¼ 0:67ðHistorical betaÞ þ 0:35ð1:0Þ:
Consider American Camping Corporation, a retailer of supplies for outdoor activi-
ties. ACC’s historical beta is 1.2. Therefore, its adjusted beta is
Adjusted beta ¼ 0:67ð1:2Þ þ 0:35ð1:0Þ ¼ 1:15:
Other researchers have extended the adjustment process to include such funda-
mental risk variables as financial leverage, sales volatility, and the like. The end prod-
uct here is a fundamental beta, which is constantly adjusted to reflect changes in a
firm’s operations and capital structure. In contrast, with historical betas (including
adjusted ones), such changes might not be reflected until several years after the com-
pany’s “true” beta had changed.
Adjusted betas obviously are heavily dependent on unadjusted historical betas,
and so are fundamental betas as they are actually calculated. Therefore, the plain
old historical beta, calculated as the slope of the characteristic line, is important
9See Marshall E. Blume, “Betas and Their Regression Tendencies,” Journal of Finance, June 1975,
pp. 785–796, and Marshall E. Blume, “On the Assessment of Risk,” Journal of Finance, March 1971,
pp. 1–10.
950
Part 10: Advanced Issues

even if one goes on to develop a more exotic version. With this in mind, it should be
noted that several different sets of data can be used to calculate historical betas, and
the different data sets produce different results. Here are some of the details.
1. Betas can be based on historical periods of different lengths. For example, data
for the past 1, 2, 3, … years may be used. Many people who calculate betas today
use 5 years of data; but this choice is arbitrary, and different lengths of time
usually alter significantly the calculated beta for a given company.
2. Returns may be calculated over holding periods of different lengths—a day, a
week, a month, a quarter, a year, and so on. For example, if it has been decided
to analyze data on NYSE stocks over a 5-year period, then we might obtain 52
(5) = 260 weekly returns on each stock and on the market index. We could also
use 12(5) = 60 monthly returns, or 1(5) = 5 annual returns. The set of returns on
each stock, however large the set turns out to be, would then be regressed on
the corresponding market returns to obtain the stock’s beta. In statistical analysis,
it is generally better to have more rather than fewer observations, because using
more observations generally leads to greater statistical confidence. This suggests
the use of weekly returns and, say, 5 years of data for a sample size of 260, or
even daily returns for a still larger sample size. However, the shorter the holding
period, the more likely the data are to exhibit random “noise.” Also, the greater
the number of years of data, the more likely it is that the company’s basic risk
position has changed. Thus, the choice of both the number of years of data and
the length of the holding period for calculating rates of return involves trade-offs
between the preference for many observations and a desire to rely on more
recent and thus more relevant data.
3. The value used to represent “the market” is also an important consideration,
because the index that is used can have a significant effect on the calculated beta.
Many analysts today use the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index (based
on more than 2,000 common stocks, weighted by the value of each company), but
others use the S&P 500 Index. In theory, the broader the index, the better the
beta. Indeed, the theoretical index should include returns on all stocks, bonds,
leases, private businesses, real estate, and even “human capital.” As a practical
matter, however, we cannot get accurate returns data on most other types of
assets, so measurement problems largely restrict us to stock indexes.
Where does this leave financial managers regarding the proper beta? They must “pay
their money and take their choice.” Some managers calculate their own betas using
whichever procedure seems most appropriate under the circumstances. Others use betas
calculated by organizations such as Yahoo! Finance or Value Line, perhaps using one ser-
vice or perhaps averaging the betas of several services. The choice is a matter of judg-
ment and data availability, for there is no “right” beta. Generally, though, the betas
derived from different sources will, for a given company, be reasonably close together.
If they are not, then our confidence in using the CAPM will be diminished.

24.6 EMPIRICAL TESTS OF THE CAPM
Does the CAPM’s SML produce reasonable estimates for a stock’s required return?
The literature dealing with empirical tests of the CAPM is quite extensive, so we can
give here only a synopsis of some of the key work.
Tests of the Stability of Beta Coefficients
According to the CAPM, the beta used to estimate a stock’s market risk should
reflect investors’ estimates of the stock’s future variability in relation to that of the mar-
ket. Obviously, we do not know now how a stock will be related to the market in the
future, nor do we know how the average investor views this expected future relative
variability. All we have are data on past variability, which we can use to plot the char-
acteristic line and to calculate historical betas. If historical betas have been stable over
time, then there would seem to be reason for investors to use past betas as estimators
of future variability. For example, if Stock i’s beta had been stable in the past, then its
historical bi would probably be a good proxy for its ex ante, or expected, beta. By “sta-
ble” we mean that if bi were calculated with data from the period of, say, 2005 to 2009,
then this same beta (approximately) should be found from 2010 to 2014.
Robert Levy, Marshall Blume, and others have studied in depth the question
of beta stability.10 Levy calculated betas for individual securities, as well as for port-
folios of securities, over a range of time intervals. He concluded (1) that the betas
of individual stocks are unstable and hence past betas for individual securities are not
good estimators of their future risk, but (2) that betas of portfolios of ten or more
randomly selected stocks are reasonably stable and hence past portfolio betas are
good estimators of future portfolio volatility. In effect, the errors in individual se-
curities’ betas tend to offset one another in a portfolio. The work of Blume and
others supports this position.
The conclusion that follows from the beta stability studies is that the CAPM is a
better concept for structuring investment portfolios than it is for estimating the
required return for individual securities.11
Tests of the CAPM Based on the Slope of the SML
The CAPM states that a linear relationship exists between a security’s required rate
of return and its beta. Moreover, when the SML is graphed, the vertical axis inter-
cept should be rRF and the required rate of return for a stock (or portfolio) with b =
1.0 should be rM, the required rate of return on the market. Various researchers have
attempted to test the validity of the CAPM by calculating betas and realized rates of
return, plotting these values in graphs such as that in Figure 24-9, and then observing
whether or not (1) the intercept is equal to rRF, (2) the plot is linear, and (3) the line
passes through the point b = 1.0, rM. Monthly or daily historical rates of return are
generally used for stocks, and both 30-day Treasury bill rates and long-term Trea-
sury bond rates have been used to estimate the value of rRF. Also, most of the studies
actually analyzed portfolios rather than individual securities because security betas are
so unstable.

Part 10: Advanced Issues

Before discussing the results of the tests, it is critical to recognize that although
the CAPM is an ex ante, or forward-looking, model, the data used to test it are
entirely historical. This presents a problem, for there is no reason to believe that
realized rates of return over past holding periods are necessarily equal to the rates of
return people expect in the future. Also, historical betas may or may not reflect
expected future risk. This lack of ex ante data makes it extremely difficult to test the
CAPM, but for what it’s worth, here is a summary of the key results.
1. The evidence generally shows a significant positive relationship between realized
returns and beta. However, the slope of the relationship is usually less than that
predicted by the CAPM.
2. The relationship between risk and return appears to be linear. Empirical studies
give no evidence of significant curvature in the risk–return relationship.
3. Tests that attempt to assess the relative importance of market and company-
specific risk do not yield conclusive results. The CAPM implies that company-
specific risk should not be relevant, yet both kinds of risk appear to be positively
related to security returns; that is, higher returns seem to be required to com-
pensate for diversifiable as well as market risk. However, it may be that the
observed relationships reflect statistical problems rather than the true nature of
capital markets.
4. Richard Roll has questioned whether it is even conceptually possible to test the
CAPM.12 Roll showed that the linear relationship that prior researchers had
observed in graphs like Figure 24-9 resulted from the mathematical properties of
the models being tested; therefore, a finding of linearity would prove nothing
whatsoever about the CAPM’s validity. Roll’s work did not disprove the CAPM,

but it did demonstrate the virtual impossibility of proving that investors behave in
accordance with its predictions.
5. If the CAPM were completely valid then it should apply to all financial assets,
including bonds. In fact, when bonds are introduced into the analysis, they do not
plot on the SML. This is worrisome, to say the least.
Current Status of the CAPM
The CAPM is extremely appealing on an intellectual level: It is logical and rational,
and once someone works through and understands the theory, his reaction is usually
to accept it without question. However, doubts begin to arise when one thinks about
the assumptions upon which the model is based, and these doubts are as much rein-
forced as reduced by the empirical tests. Our own views on the CAPM’s current sta-
tus are as follows.
1. The CAPM framework, with its focus on market as opposed to stand-alone risk,
is clearly a useful way to think about the risk of assets. Thus, as a conceptual
model, the CAPM is of truly fundamental importance.
2. When applied in practice, the CAPM appears to provide neat, precise answers
to important questions about risk and required rates of return. However, the
answers are less clear than they seem. The simple truth is that we do not know
precisely how to measure any of the inputs required to implement the CAPM.
These inputs should all be ex ante, yet only ex post data are available. Further-
more, historical data on r¯M, rRF, and betas vary greatly depending on the time
period studied and the methods used to estimate them. Thus, even though the
CAPM appears to be precise, estimates of ri found through its use are subject to
potentially large errors.13
3. Because the CAPM is logical in the sense that it represents the way risk-averse
people ought to behave, the model is a useful conceptual tool.
4. It is appropriate to think about many financial problems in a CAPM framework.
However, it is important to recognize the limitations of the CAPM when using it
in practice.

of the CAPM? (Beta stability; slope of the SML) Explain their results.
Are there any reasons to question the validity of the CAPM? Explain.
24.7 ARBITRAGE PRICING THEORY
The CAPM is a single-factor model. That is, it specifies risk as a function of only
one factor, the security’s beta coefficient. Perhaps the risk–return relationship is
more complex, with a stock’s required return a function of more than one factor.
For example, what if investors, because personal tax rates on capital gains are lower
than those on dividends, value capital gains more highly than dividends? Then, if two
stocks had the same market risk, the stock paying the higher dividend would have the
higher required rate of return. In that case, required returns would be a function of
two factors, market risk and dividend policy.
13For an article supporting a positive link between market risk and expected return, see Felicia Marston
and Robert S. Harris, “Risk and Return: A Revisit Using Expected Returns,” The Financial Review,
February 1993, pp. 117–137.
954
Part 10: Advanced Issues

Further, what if many factors are required to specify the equilibrium risk–return
relationship rather than just one or two? Stephen Ross has proposed an approach
called the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT).14 The APT can include any number
of risk factors, so the required return could be a function of two, three, four, or
more factors. We should note at the outset that the APT is based on complex math-
ematical and statistical theory that goes far beyond the scope of this text. Also,
although the APT model is widely discussed in academic literature, practical usage
to date has been limited. However, such use may increase, so students should at least
have an intuitive idea of what the APT is all about.
The SML states that each stock’s required return is equal to the risk-free rate plus
the product of the market risk premium times the stock’s beta coefficient. If stocks
are in equilibrium, then the required return will be equal to the expected return:
^ri ¼ ri ¼ rRF þ ðrM −rRFÞbi
The historical realized return, ¯ri, which will generally be different from the expected
return, can be expressed as follows:15
¯ri ¼ ^ri þ ð¯rM −^rMÞbi þ ei
(24-14)
Thus, the realized return, ¯ri, will be equal to the expected return, ^ri, plus a positive or
negative increment, ð¯rM −^rMÞbi, which depends jointly on the stock’s beta and on
whether the market did better or worse than was expected, plus a random error term, ei.
The market’s realized return, ¯rM, is in turn determined by a number of factors,
including domestic economic activity as measured by gross domestic product
(GDP), the strength of the world economy, the level of inflation, changes in tax
laws, and so forth. Further, different groups of stocks are affected in different ways
by these fundamental factors. So, rather than specifying a stock’s return as a function
of one factor (return on the market), one could specify required and realized returns
on individual stocks as a function of various fundamental economic factors. If this
were done, we would transform Equation 24-14 into 24-15:
¯ri ¼ ^ri þ ð¯F1 −^F1Þbi1 þ … þ ð¯Fj −^FjÞbij þ ei
(24-15)
Here,
¯ri ¼ Realized rate of return on Stock i:
^ri ¼ Expected rate of return on Stock i:
¯Fj ¼ Realized value of economic Factor j:
^Fj ¼ Expected value of Factor j:
bij ¼ Sensitivity of Stock i to economic Factor j:
ei ¼ Effect of unique events on the realized return of Stock i:

15To avoid cluttering the notation, we have dropped the subscript t to denote a particular time period.
Chapter 24: Portfolio Theory, Asset Pricing Models, and Behavioral Finance
955

Equation 24-15 shows that the realized return on any stock is the sum of: (1) the
stock’s expected return; (2) increases or decreases that depend on unexpected changes
in fundamental economic factors, multiplied by the sensitivity of the stock to these
changes; and (3) a random term that reflects changes unique to the firm.
Certain stocks or groups of stocks are most sensitive to Factor 1, others to Factor
2, and so forth, and every portfolio’s returns depend on what happened to the differ-
ent fundamental factors. Theoretically, one could construct a portfolio such that (1)
the portfolio was riskless and (2) the net investment in it was zero (some stocks would
be sold short, with the proceeds from the short sales being used to buy the stocks
held long). Such a zero-investment portfolio must have a zero expected return, or
else arbitrage operations would occur and cause the prices of the underlying assets
to change until the portfolio’s expected return became zero. Using some complex
mathematics and a set of assumptions that include the possibility of short sales,
the APT equivalent of the CAPM’s Security Market Line can be developed from
Equation 24-15 as follows:16
ri ¼ rRF þ ðr1 −rRFÞbi1 þ … þ ðrj −rRFÞbij
(24-16)
Here rj is the required rate of return on a portfolio that is sensitive only to economic
Factor j (bpj = 1.0) and has zero sensitivity to all other factors. Thus, for example,
(r2 −rRF) is the risk premium on a portfolio with bp2 = 1.0 and all other bpj = 0.0.
Note that Equation 24-16 is identical in form to the SML, but it permits a stock’s
required return to be a function of multiple factors.
To illustrate the APT concept, assume that all stocks’ returns depend on only
three risk factors: inflation, industrial production, and the aggregate degree of risk
aversion (the cost of bearing risk, which we assume is reflected in the spread between
the yields on Treasury and low-grade bonds). Further, suppose that: (1) the risk-free
rate is 8.0%; (2) the required rate of return is 13% on a portfolio with unit sensitivity
(b = 1.0) to inflation and zero sensitivities (b = 0.0) to industrial production and
degree of risk aversion; (3) the required return is 10% on a portfolio with unit sensi-
tivity to industrial production and zero sensitivities to inflation and degree of risk
aversion; and (4) the required return is 6% on a portfolio (the risk-bearing portfolio)
with unit sensitivity to the degree of risk aversion and zero sensitivities to inflation
and industrial production. Finally, assume that Stock i has factor sensitivities (betas)
of 0.9 to the inflation portfolio, 1.2 to the industrial production portfolio, and −0.7 to
the risk-bearing portfolio. Stock i’s required rate of return, according to the APT,
would be 16.3%:
ri ¼ 8% þ ð13% −8%Þ0:9 þ ð10% −8%Þ1:2 þ ð6% −8%Þð−0:7Þ
¼ 16:3%
Note that if the required rate of return on the market were 15.0% and if Stock i had
a CAPM beta of 1.1, then its required rate of return, according to the SML, would
be 15.7%:
ri ¼ 8% þ ð15% −8%Þ1:1 ¼ 15:7%
The primary theoretical advantage of the APT is that it permits several economic
factors to influence individual stock returns, whereas the CAPM assumes that the
16See Thomas E. Copeland, J. Fred Weston, and Kuldeep Shastri, Financial Theory and Corporate Policy,

Part 10: Advanced Issues

effect of all factors, except those that are unique to the firm, can be captured in a
single measure: the variability of the stock with respect to the market portfolio.
Also, the APT requires fewer assumptions than the CAPM and hence is more gen-
eral. Finally, the APT does not assume that all investors hold the market portfolio, a
CAPM requirement that is clearly not met in practice.
However, the APT faces several major hurdles in implementation, the most severe
of which is that the theory does not actually identify the relevant factors. The APT
does not tell us what factors influence returns, nor does it even indicate how many
factors should appear in the model. There is some empirical evidence that only three
or four factors are relevant: perhaps inflation, industrial production, the spread
between low- and high-grade bonds, and the term structure of interest rates—but
no one knows for sure.
The APT’s proponents argue that it is not actually necessary to identify the rele-
vant factors. Researchers use a statistical procedure called factor analysis to develop
the APT parameters. Basically, they start with hundreds, or even thousands, of stocks
and then create several different portfolios, where the returns on each portfolio are
not highly correlated with returns on the other portfolios. Thus, each portfolio is
apparently more heavily influenced by one of the unknown factors than are the other
portfolios. Then, the required rate of return on each portfolio becomes the estimate
for that unknown economic factor, shown as rj in Equation 24-16. The sensitivities of
each individual stock’s returns to the returns on that portfolio are the factor sensitiv-
ities (betas). Unfortunately, the results of factor analysis are not easily interpreted;
hence it does not provide significant insights into the underlying economic determi-
nants of risk.17

What is the primary difference between the APT and the CAPM?
What are some disadvantages of the APT?
An analyst has modeled the stock of Brown Kitchen Supplies using a two-factor APT
model. The risk-free rate is 5%, the required return on the first factor (r1) is 10%, and
the required return on the second factor (r2) is 15%. If bi1 = 0.5 and bi2 = 1.3, what is
Brown’s required return? (20.5%)
24.8 THE FAMA-FRENCH THREE-FACTOR MODEL
Table 24-4 reports the returns for 25 portfolios, commonly called the Fama-French
portfolios because professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French were the first to
form them. These portfolios are based on the company’s size as measured by the
market value of its equity (MVE) and the company’s book-to-market ratio (B/M),
defined as the book value of equity divided by the market value of equity. Each row
shows portfolios with similarly sized companies; each column shows portfolios whose
companies have similar B/M ratios. Notice that if you look across each row, the
average return tends to increase as the B/M ratio increases. In other words, stocks
with high B/M ratios have higher returns. If you look down each column (except
for the column with the lowest B/M ratios), stock returns tend to increase: Small
companies have higher returns.

What might explain this pattern? If the market value is larger than the book value,
then investors are optimistic about the stock’s future. On the other hand, if the book
value is larger than the market value, then investors are pessimistic about the stock’s
future, and it is likely that a ratio analysis will reveal that the company is experiencing
impaired operating performance and possibly even financial distress. In other words, a
stock with a high B/M ratio might be risky, in which case investors would require a
higher expected return to induce them to invest in such a stock.
Small companies have less access to capital markets than do large companies,
which subjects small companies to greater risk in the event of a credit crunch—such
as the one occurring during the global economic crisis that began in 2007. With
greater risk, investors would require a higher expected return to induce them to
invest in small companies.
As we mentioned in Chapter 6, the results of two studies by Eugene F. Fama and
Kenneth R. French seriously challenge the CAPM.18 In the first of these studies,
published in 1992, Fama and French hypothesized that the SML should have three
factors. The first is the stock’s CAPM beta, which measures the market risk of the
stock. The second is the size of the company, measured by the market value of its
equity (MVE). The third factor is the book-to-market ratio (B/M).
When Fama and French tested their hypotheses, they found that small companies
and companies with high B/M ratios had higher rates of return than the average
stock, just as they hypothesized. Somewhat surprisingly, however, they found no
relation between beta and return. After taking into account the returns due to the
company’s size and B/M ratio, high-beta stocks did not have higher than average re-
turns and low-beta stocks did not have lower than average returns.
In the second of their two studies, published in 1993, Fama and French
developed a three-factor model based on their previous results. The first factor in

of 5 portfolios formed on size (market equity, ME) and 5 portfolios formed on the ratio of book equity
to market equity (BE/ME). The size breakpoints for year t are the NYSE market equity quintiles at the
end of June of t. BE/ME for June of year t is the book equity for the last fiscal year end in t −1 divided
by ME for December of t −1. The BE/ME breakpoints are NYSE quintiles. The portfolios for July of
year t to June of t + 1 include all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks for which we have market equity
data for December of t −1 and June of t, and (positive) book equity data for t −1.”

Part 10: Advanced Issues

the Fama-French three-factor model is the market risk premium, which is the
market return, ¯rM, minus the risk-free rate, ¯rRF. Thus, their model begins like the
CAPM, but they go on to add a second and third factor.19 To form the second fac-
tor, they ranked all actively traded stocks by size and then divided them into two
portfolios, one consisting of small stocks and one consisting of big stocks. They cal-
culated the return on each of these two portfolios and created a third portfolio by
subtracting the return on the big portfolio from that of the small one. They called
this the SMB (small minus big) portfolio. This portfolio is designed to measure the
variation in stock returns that is caused by the size effect.
To form the third factor, they ranked all stocks according to their book-to-market
ratios (B/M). They placed the 30% of stocks with the highest ratios into a portfolio
they called the H portfolio (for high B/M ratios) and placed the 30% of stocks with
the lowest ratios into a portfolio called the L portfolio (for low B/M ratios). Then
they subtracted the return of the L portfolio from that of the H portfolio to derive
the HML (high minus low) portfolio. Their resulting model is shown here:

The Fama-French three-factor model version of the CAPM Security Market Line for
the required return on a stock is
ri ¼ rRF þ ai þ biðrM −rRFÞ þ ciðrSMBÞ þ diðrHMLÞ

where rM −rRF is the market risk premium, rSMB is the expected value (i.e., pre-
mium) for the size factor, and rHML is the expected value (i.e., premium) for the
book-to-market factor.
Here is how you might apply this model. Suppose you ran the regression in
Equation 24-17 for a stock and estimated the following regression coefficients: ai =
0.0, bi = 0.9, ci = 0.2, and di = 0.3. Assume that the expected market risk premium is
6% (i.e., rM −rRF = 6%) and that the risk-free rate is 6.5%. Suppose the expected

value of rSMB is 3.2% and the expected value of rHML is 4.8%.20 Using the Fama-

(24-18a)
To date, the Fama-French three-factor model has been used primarily by aca-
demic researchers rather than by managers of actual companies, the majority of
whom are still using the CAPM. Part of this difference was due at one time to the
lack of available data. Most professors had access to the type of data required to cal-
culate the factors, but data for the size factor and the B/M factor were not readily
available to the general public. To help alleviate this problem, Professor French has
made the required historical data available on his Web site.21 However, it is still dif-
ficult to estimate the expected values of the size factor and the B/M factor. Although
we know the historical average returns for these factors, we don’t know whether the
past historical returns are good estimators of the future expected returns. In other
words, we don’t know the risk premium associated with the size and book/market
sources of risk. Finally, many managers choose to wait and adopt a new theory only
after it has been widely accepted by the academic community.
And that isn’t the case right now. In fact, there are a number of subsequent studies
indicating that the Fama-French model is not correct.22 Several of these studies sug-
gest that the size effect no longer influences stock returns, that there never was a size
effect (the previous results were caused by peculiarities in the data sources), or that
the size effect doesn’t apply to most companies. Other studies suggest that the
book-to-market effect is not as significant as first supposed and/or that the book-
to-market effect is not a function of risk. Another study shows that if the composition
of a company’s assets were changing over time with respect to the mix of physical
assets and growth opportunities (involving, e.g., R&D or patents), then this would
be enough to make it appear as though there were size and book-to-market effects.
In other words, even if the returns on the individual assets conform to the CAPM,
changes in the mix of assets would cause the firm’s beta to change over time in such
a way that the firm would appear to have size and book-to-market effects.23

24.9 AN ALTERNATIVE THEORY OF RISK AND RETURN:
BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
The Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH) is one of the cornerstones of modern
finance theory. It implies that, on average, assets trade at prices equal to their intrin-
sic values. As we note in Chapter 7, the logic behind the EMH is straightforward. If a
stock’s price is “too low” then rational traders will quickly take advantage of this
opportunity and will buy the stock, and these actions will quickly push prices back
to their equilibrium level. Likewise, if a stock’s price is “too high” then rational tra-
ders will sell it, pushing the price down to its equilibrium level. Proponents of the
EMH argue that prices cannot be systematically wrong unless you believe that mar-
ket participants are unable or unwilling to take advantage of profitable trading
opportunities.
The logic behind the EMH is compelling, but some events seem to be inconsis-
tent with the hypothesis. First, there is some evidence that stocks may have short-
term momentum. Stocks that perform poorly tend to continue performing poorly
over the next 3 to 12 months, and stocks that perform well tend to continue perform-
ing well in the short-term future. On the other hand, there is some evidence that
stocks have long-term reversals. In particular, stocks that have the lowest returns in a
5-year period tend to outperform the market during the next 5 years. The opposite is
true for stocks that outperform the market during a 5-year period: They tend to have
lower than average returns during the next 5-year period.24
In response to such observations, a number of researchers are blending psychology
with finance, creating a new field called behavioral finance. A large body of evi-
dence in the field of psychology indicates that people don’t behave rationally in
many areas of their lives, so some argue that we should not expect people to behave
rationally with their investments.25 Pioneers in this field include psychologists Daniel
Kahneman and Amos Tversky, along with University of Chicago finance professor
Richard Thaler. Their work has encouraged a growing number of scholars to work
in this promising area of research.
Professor Thaler and his colleague Nicholas Barberis have summarized much of
this research.26 They argue that behavioral finance theory rests on two important
building blocks. First, mispricing can persist because it is often difficult or risky for
traders to take advantage of mispriced assets. For example, even if it is clear that a

forces that pushed the price down may work to keep it artificially low for a long
period of time. On the other side, during the stock market bubble that burst in
2000, many traders who believed (correctly!) that stock prices were too high lost a
lot of money selling stocks in the early stages of the bubble, because stock prices
climbed even higher before they eventually collapsed. In other words, there is no
reliable way to take advantage of mispricing.
While the first building block explains why mispricings may persist, the second
tries to understand how mispricings occur in the first place. This is where the insights
from psychology come into play. For example, Kahneman and Tversky suggest that
individuals view potential losses and potential gains very differently.27 If you ask an
average person whether he or she would rather have $500 with certainty or flip a
fair coin and receive $1,000 if it comes up heads and nothing if it comes up tails,
most would prefer the certain $500 gain, which suggests an aversion to risk. How-
ever, if you ask the same person whether he or she would rather pay $500 with cer-
tainty or flip a coin and pay $1,000 if it’s heads and nothing if it’s tails, most would
indicate that they prefer to flip the coin. But this implies a preference for risk. In
other words, people appear to dislike risk when it comes to possible gains but will
take on risk in order to avoid sure losses. Other experiments have reinforced this
idea that most people experience “loss aversion,” or a strong desire to avoid realizing
losses. In irrational, but common, mental bookkeeping, a loss isn’t really a loss until
the losing investment is actually sold. This leads investors to sell losers much less fre-
quently than winners even though this is suboptimal for tax purposes.28
Not only do most people view risky gains and losses differently, but other studies sug-
gest that people’s willingness to take a gamble depends on recent past performance.
Gamblers who are ahead tend to take on more risks (i.e., they are playing with the
house’s money), whereas those who are behind tend to become more conservative.
These experiments suggest that investors and managers behave differently in down mar-
kets than they do in up markets, in which they are playing with the “house’s” money.
Many psychological tests also show that people are overconfident with respect to
their own abilities relative to the abilities of others, which is the basis of Garrison
Keillor’s joke about a town where all the children are above average. Barberis and
Thaler point out:
Overconfidence may in part stem from two other biases, self attribution bias and hindsight
bias. Self attribution bias refers to people’s tendency to ascribe any success they have in some
activity to their own talents, while blaming failure on bad luck, rather than on their
ineptitude. Doing this repeatedly will lead people to the pleasing but erroneous conclusion
that they are very talented. For example, investors might become overconfident after sev-
eral quarters of investing success [Gervais and Odean (2001)29]. Hindsight bias is the ten-
dency of people to believe, after an event has occurred, that they predicted it before it
happened. If people think they predicted the past better than they actually did, they may
also believe that they can predict the future better than they actually can. (2003, p. 1066)
Some researchers have hypothesized that the combination of overconfidence and
biased self-attribution leads to overly volatile stock markets, short-term momentum, and

long-term reversals.30 In other words, stock returns reflect the (predictably) irrational
behavior of humans. Behavioral finance also has implications for corporate finance.
Research by Ulrike Malmendier and Geoffrey Tate suggests that overconfidence leads
managers to overestimate their abilities and the quality of their projects.31 This result
may explain why so many corporate projects fail to live up to their stated expectations.

Summary
The primary goal of this chapter was to extend your knowledge of risk and return
concepts. The key concepts covered are listed below.
•
The feasible set of portfolios represents all portfolios that can be constructed
from a given set of assets.
•
An efficient portfolio is one that offers the most return for a given amount of
risk or the least risk for a given amount of return.
•
The optimal portfolio for an investor is defined by the investor’s highest possi-
ble indifference curve that is tangent to the efficient set of portfolios.
•
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) describes the relationship between
market risk and required rates of return.
•
The Capital Market Line (CML) describes the risk–return relationship for
efficient portfolios—that is, for portfolios consisting of a mix of the market
portfolio and a riskless asset.
•
The Security Market Line (SML) is an integral part of the CAPM, and it
describes the risk–return relationship for individual assets. The required rate of
return for any Stock i is equal to the risk-free rate plus the market risk
premium multiplied by the stock’s beta coefficient: ri = rRF + (rM −rRF)bi.
•
Stock i’s beta coefficient, bi, is a measure of the stock’s market risk. Beta
measures the variability of returns on a security relative to returns on the
market, which is the portfolio of all risky assets.
•
The beta coefficient is measured by the slope of the stock’s characteristic line,
which is found by regressing historical returns on the stock versus historical re-
turns on the market.
•
Although the CAPM provides a convenient framework for thinking about risk
and return issues, it cannot be proven empirically and its parameters are extremely
difficult to estimate. Thus, the required rate of return for a stock as estimated by
the CAPM may not be exactly equal to the true required rate of return.
•
In contrast to the CAPM, the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) hypothesizes
that expected stock returns are due to more than one factor.
•
The Fama-French three-factor model has one factor for the market return, a
second factor for the size effect, and a third factor for the book-to-market effect.
•
Behavioral finance assumes that investors don’t always behave rationally.

Risk and Return
You are planning to invest $200,000. Two securities are available, A and B, and you
can invest in either of them or in a portfolio with some of each. You estimate that the
following probability distributions of returns are applicable for A and B:
a. The expected return for Security B is ^rB ¼ 20%, and σB ¼ 25:7%. Find ^rA and σA
b. Use Equation 24-3 to find the value of wA that produces the minimum risk
portfolio. Assume ρAB = −0.5 for parts b and c.
c. Construct a table giving ^rp and σp for portfolios with wA = 1.00, 0.75, 0.50, 0.25,
0.0, and the minimum risk value of wA. (Hint: For wA = 0.75, ^rp = 16.25% and
σp = 8.5%; for wA = 0.5, ^rp = 17.5% and σp = 11.1%; for wA = 0.25, ^rp = 18.75%
and σp = 17.9%.)
d. Graph the feasible set of portfolios and identify the efficient frontier of the
feasible set.
e. Suppose your risk–return trade-off function, or indifference curve, is tangent
to the efficient set at the point where ^rp = 18%. Use this information,
together with the graph constructed in part d, to locate (approximately) your

Problems
Answers Appear in Appendix B
EASY PROBLEMS 1–3
(24–1)
Beta
The standard deviation of stock returns for Stock A is 40%. The standard deviation
of the market return is 20%. If the correlation between Stock A and the market is
0.70, then what is Stock A’s beta?
(24–2)
APT
An analyst has modeled the stock of Crisp Trucking using a two-factor APT model.
The risk-free rate is 6%, the expected return on the first factor (r1) is 12%, and the
expected return on the second factor (r2) is 8%. If bi1= 0.7 and bi2 = 0.9, what is
Crisp’s required return?
(24–3)
Fama-French Three-
Factor Model
An analyst has modeled the stock of a company using the Fama-French three-
factor model. The risk-free rate is 5%, the required market return is 10%, the
risk premium for small stocks (rSMB) is 3.2%, and the risk premium for value
stocks (rHML) is 4.8%. If ai = 0, bi = 1.2, ci = −0.4, and di = 1.3, what is the
stock’s required return?
INTERMEDIATE PROBLEMS 4–6

Two-Asset Portfolio
Stock A has an expected return of 12% and a standard deviation of 40%. Stock B has
an expected return of 18% and a standard deviation of 60%. The correlation coeffi-
cient between Stocks A and B is 0.2. What are the expected return and standard
deviation of a portfolio invested 30% in Stock A and 70% in Stock B?

CAPM and the Fama-
French Three-Factor
Model
Suppose you are given the following information: The beta of Company i, bi, is 1.1;
the risk-free rate, rRF, is 7%; and the expected market premium, rM −rRF, is 6.5%.
Assume that ai = 0.0.
a. Use the Security Market Line (SML) of the CAPM to find the required return
for this company.
b. Because your company is smaller than average and more successful than average
(that is, it has a low book-to-market ratio), you think the Fama-French three-
factor model might be more appropriate than the CAPM. You estimate the
additional coefficients from the Fama-French three-factor model: The coeffi-
cient for the size effect, ci, is 0.7, and the coefficient for the book-to-market
effect, di, is −0.3. If the expected value of the size factor is 5% and the expected
value of the book-to-market factor is 4%, what is the required return using the
Fama-French three-factor model?

example, ρAB = 0.1571 is in the row for A and the column for B. Notice that the di-
agonal values are equal to 1 because a variable is always perfectly correlated with
itself.
a. Suppose a portfolio has 30% invested in A, 50% in B, and 20% in C. What are the
expected return and standard deviation of the portfolio?
b. The partial model lists six different combinations of portfolio weights. For each
combination of weights, find the required return and standard deviation.
c. The partial model provides a scatter diagram showing the required returns and

tion that you must accept?
Mini Case
Answer the following questions.
a. Suppose Asset A has an expected return of 10% and a standard deviation of 20%. Asset
B has an expected return of 16% and a standard deviation of 40%. If the correlation be-
tween A and B is 0.35, what are the expected return and standard deviation for a port-
folio consisting of 30% Asset A and 70% Asset B?
b. Plot the attainable portfolios for a correlation of 0.35. Now plot the attainable portfo-
lios for correlations of +1.0 and −1.0.
c. Suppose a risk-free asset has an expected return of 5%. By definition, its standard devi-
ation is zero, and its correlation with any other asset is also zero. Using only Asset A
and the risk-free asset, plot the attainable portfolios.
d. Construct a plausible graph that shows risk (as measured by portfolio standard devia-
tion) on the x-axis and expected rate of return on the y-axis. Now add an illustrative fea-
sible (or attainable) set of portfolios and show what portion of the feasible set is
efficient. What makes a particular portfolio efficient? Don’t worry about specific values
when constructing the graph—merely illustrate how things look with “reasonable” data.
e. Add a set of indifference curves to the graph created for part b. What do these curves
represent? What is the optimal portfolio for this investor? Add a second set of indiffer-
ence curves that leads to the selection of a different optimal portfolio. Why do the two
investors choose different portfolios?
f. What is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)? What are the assumptions that un-
derlie the model?
g. Now add the risk-free asset. What impact does this have on the efficient frontier?
h. Write out the equation for the Capital Market Line (CML), and draw it on the graph.
Interpret the plotted CML. Now add a set of indifference curves and illustrate how an
investor’s optimal portfolio is some combination of the risky portfolio and the risk-free
asset. What is the composition of the risky portfolio?
i. What is a characteristic line? How is this line used to estimate a stock’s beta coefficient?
Write out and explain the formula that relates total risk, market risk, and diversifiable
risk.

l. Suppose you are given the following information: The beta of a company, bi, is 0.9; the
risk-free rate, rRF, is 6.8%; and the expected market premium, rM −rRF, is 6.3%. Because
your company is larger than average and more successful than average (that is, it has a
lower book-to-market ratio), you think the Fama-French three-factor model might be
more appropriate than the CAPM. You estimate the additional coefficients from the
Fama-French three-factor model: The coefficient for the size effect, ci, is −0.5, and the
coefficient for the book-to-market effect, di, is −0.3. If the expected value of the size fac-
tor is 4% and the expected value of the book-to-market factor is 5%, then what is the
required return using the Fama-French three-factor model? (Assume that ai = 0.0.) What
is the required return using CAPM?

onda Motor Company spent $400 million dollars on something it might
not need—production flexibility. If demand for its vehicles changed in
predictable ways, then Honda would have wasted the $400 million
dollars. But as we have seen in the global economic recession, demand
for automobiles is highly volatile, with consumer preferences swinging
wildly every time oil prices change. To prepare for such volatility, Honda
has been building flexibility into its factories and now boasts the most
flexibility of any auto maker in the United States.
Honda’s plant in Liberty, Ohio, can stop Civic production, set up for the
CR-V crossover, and start producing CR-Vs in less than 10 minutes,
incurring virtually no additional cost in the process. Many of its other
plants have similar capabilities. For example, Honda has been able to
quickly reduce output of its Ridgeline pickup truck and boost production of
more fuel-efficient vehicles. In contrast, Ford will take over a year to
convert a factory now producing gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles, with
the switchover costing over $75 million. GM has similar problems and will
spend $370 million to change models at one of its factories.
Honda’s flexibility is due to several factors, beginning with designs for
vehicles and production processes that share components and assembly
techniques. For example, the assembly process for doors is very similar,
no matter what vehicle is being produced. Honda’s robots also give
it flexibility. For example, the same robots are used to weld different
vehicles.
It costs more initially to build in flexibility at a factory, but the payoff can
be well worth the cost. As you read this chapter and learn more about
options, think about how option pricing techniques can lead to better
capital budgeting decisions.

Traditional discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis—in which an asset’s cash flows are
estimated and then discounted to obtain the asset’s NPV—has been the cornerstone
for valuing all types of assets since the 1950s. Accordingly, most of our discussion of
capital budgeting has focused on DCF valuation techniques. However, in recent years
academics and practitioners have demonstrated that DCF valuation techniques do not
always tell the complete story about a project’s value and that rote use of DCF can, at
times, lead to incorrect capital budgeting decisions.1
DCF techniques were originally developed to value securities such as stocks and
bonds. Securities are passive investments: Once they have been purchased, most inves-
tors have no influence over the cash flows the assets produce. However, real assets are
not passive investments because managerial actions after an investment has been made
can influence its results. Furthermore, investing in a new project often brings with it
the potential for increasing the firm’s future investment opportunities. Such opportu-
nities are, in effect, options—the right (but not the obligation) to take some action in
the future. As we demonstrate in the next section, options are valuable, so projects that
expand the firm’s set of opportunities have positive option values. Similarly, any proj-
ect that reduces the set of future opportunities destroys option value. Since a project’s
impact on the firm’s opportunities, or its option value, may not be captured by conven-
tional NPV analysis, this option value should be considered separately, as we do in this
chapter.
25.1 VALUING REAL OPTIONS
Recall from Chapter 11 that real options are opportunities for management to
change the timing, scale, or other aspects of an investment in response to changes
in market conditions. These opportunities are options in the sense that management
can, if it is in the company’s best interest, undertake some action; management is not
required to undertake the action. These opportunities are real (as opposed to finan-
cial) because they involve decisions regarding real assets—such as plants, equipment,
and land—rather than financial assets like stocks or bonds. Four examples of real
options are investment timing options, growth options, abandonment options, and
flexibility options. This chapter provides an example of how to value an investment
timing option and a growth option. Web Extension 25A on the textbook’s Web site
shows how to value an abandonment option.
Valuing a real option requires judgment, both to formulate the model and to esti-
mate the inputs. Does this mean the answer won’t be useful? Definitely not. For
example, the models used by NASA only approximate the centers of gravity for the
moon, the earth, and other heavenly bodies, yet even with these “errors” in their
models, NASA has been able to put astronauts on the moon. As one professor said,
“All models are wrong, but some are still quite useful.” This is especially true for real
options. We might not be able to find the exact value of a real option, but the value
we find can be helpful in deciding whether or not to accept the project. Equally
important, the process of looking for and then valuing real options often identifies
critical issues that might otherwise go unnoticed.
Five possible procedures can be used to deal with real options. Starting with the
simplest, they are as follows.

ques as applied to capital budgeting, see Avinash K. Dixit and Robert S. Pindyck, “The Options Approach

25.2 THE INVESTMENT TIMING OPTION: AN ILLUSTRATION
There is frequently an alternative to investing immediately—the decision to invest or
not can be postponed until more information becomes available. By waiting, a better-
informed decision can be made, and this investment timing option adds value to the
project and reduces its risk.
Murphy Systems is considering a project for a new type of handheld device that
provides wireless Internet connections. The cost of the project is $50 million, but
the future cash flows depend on the demand for wireless Internet connections, which
is uncertain. Murphy believes there is a 25% chance that demand for the new device
will be high, in which case the project will generate cash flows of $33 million each
year for 3 years. There is a 50% chance of average demand, with cash flows of $25
million per year, and a 25% chance that demand will be low and annual cash flows
will be only $5 million. A preliminary analysis indicates that the project is somewhat
riskier than average, so it has been assigned a cost of capital of 14% versus 12% for
an average project at Murphy Systems. Here is a summary of the project’s data:

Murphy could accept the project and implement it immediately; however, since
the company has a patent on the device’s core modules, it could also choose to delay
the decision until next year, when more information about demand will be available.
The cost will still be $50 million if Murphy waits, and the project will still be
expected to generate the indicated cash flows, but each flow will be pushed back
1 year. However, if Murphy waits then it will know which of the demand conditions—
and hence which set of cash flows—will obtain. If Murphy waits then it will, of course,
make the investment only if demand is sufficient to yield a positive NPV.
Observe that this real timing option resembles a call option on a stock. A call gives
its owner the right to purchase a stock at a fixed strike price, but only if the stock’s
price is higher than the strike price will the owner exercise the option and buy the
stock. Similarly, if Murphy defers implementation, then it will have the right to

“purchase” the project by making the $50 million investment if the NPV as calcu-
lated next year, when new information is available, is positive.
Approach 1. DCF Analysis Ignoring the Timing Option
Based on probabilities for the different levels of demand, the expected annual cash
flows are $22 million per year:
Expected cash flow per year ¼ 0:25ð$33Þ þ 0:50ð$25Þ þ 0:25ð$5Þ
¼ $22 million
Ignoring the investment timing option, the traditional NPV is $1.08 million, found
as follows:
NPV ¼ −$50 þ
$22
ð1 þ 0:14Þ1 þ
$22
ð1 þ 0:14Þ2 þ
$22
ð1 þ 0:14Þ3 ¼ $1:08
The present value of the cash inflows is $51.08 million while the cost is $50 million,
leaving an NPV of $1.08 million.
Based just on this DCF analysis, Murphy should accept the project. Note, how-
ever, that if the expected cash flows had been slightly lower—say, $21.5 million per
year—then the NPV would have been negative and the project would have been
rejected. Also, note that the project is risky: there is a 25% probability that demand
will be weak, in which case the NPV will turn out to be a negative $38.4 million.
Approach 2. DCF Analysis with a Qualitative
Consideration of the Timing Option
The discounted cash flow analysis suggests that the project should be accepted, but
just barely, and it ignores the existence of a possibly valuable real option. If Murphy
implements the project now, it gains an expected (but risky) NPV of $1.08 million.
However, accepting now means that it is also giving up the option to wait and learn
more about market demand before making the commitment. Thus, the decision is
this: Is the option Murphy would be giving up worth more or less than $1.08 million?
If the option is worth more than $1.08 million then Murphy should not give up the
option, which means deferring the decision—and vice versa if the option is worth less
than $1.08 million.
Based on the discussion of financial options in Chapter 8, what qualitative assess-
ment can we make regarding the option’s value? Put another way: Without doing any
additional calculations, does it appear that Murphy should go forward now or wait?
In thinking about this decision, first note that the value of an option is higher if the
current value of the underlying asset is high relative to its strike price, other things
held constant. For example, a call option with a strike price of $50 on a stock with a
current price of $50 is worth more than if the current price were $20. The strike
price of the project is $50 million, and our first guess at the value of its cash flows is
$51.08 million. We will calculate the exact value of Murphy’s underlying asset later,
but the DCF analysis does suggest that the underlying asset’s value will be close to
the strike price, so the option should be valuable. We also know that an option’s
value is higher the longer its time to expiration. Here the option has a 1-year life,
which is fairly long for an option, and this also suggests that the option is probably
valuable. Finally, we know that the value of an option increases with the risk of the
underlying asset. The data used in the DCF analysis indicate that the project is quite
risky, which again suggests that the option is valuable.
974
Part 10: Advanced Issues

Thus, our qualitative assessment indicates that the option to delay might well be more
valuable than the expected NPV of $1.08 if we undertake the project immediately. This
conclusion is quite subjective, but the qualitative assessment suggests that Murphy’s
management should go on to make a quantitative assessment of the situation.
Approach 3. Scenario Analysis and Decision Trees
Part 1 of Figure 25-1 presents a scenario analysis and decision tree similar to the
examples in Chapter 11. Each possible outcome is shown as a “branch” on the tree.
Each branch shows the cash flows and probability of a scenario laid out as a time line.
Thus, the top line, which gives the payoffs of the high-demand scenario, has positive
cash flows of $33 million for the next 3 years, and its NPV is $26.61 million. The
average-demand branch in the middle has an NPV of $8.04 million, while the NPV
of the low-demand branch is a negative $38.39 million. Since Murphy will suffer a

$38.39 million loss if demand is weak and since there is a 25% probability of weak
demand, the project is clearly risky.
The expected NPV is the weighted average of the three possible outcomes, where the
weight for each outcome is its probability. The sum in the last column in Part 1 shows
that the expected NPV is $1.08 million, the same as in the original DCF analysis. Part 1
also shows a standard deviation of $24.02 million for the NPV and a coefficient of varia-
tion (defined as the ratio of standard deviation to the expected NPV) of 22.32, which is
rather large. Clearly, the project is quite risky under the analysis thus far.
Part 2 is set up similarly to Part 1 except that it shows what happens if Murphy
delays the decision and then implements the project only if demand turns out to be
high or average. No cost is incurred now at Year 0—here the only action is to wait.
Then, if demand is average or high, Murphy will spend $50 million at Year 1 and
receive either $33 million or $25 million per year for the following 3 years. If demand
is low, as shown on the bottom branch, Murphy will spend nothing at Year 1 and will
receive no cash flows in subsequent years. The NPV of the high-demand branch is
$23.35 million and that of the average-demand branch is $7.05 million. Because all
cash flows under the low-demand scenario are zero, the NPV in this case will also be
zero. The expected NPV if Murphy delays the decision is $9.36 million.
This analysis shows that the project’s expected NPV will be much higher if Mur-
phy delays than if it invests immediately. Also, since there is no possibility of losing
money under the delay option, this decision also lowers the project’s risk. This
plainly indicates that the option to wait is valuable; hence Murphy should wait until
Year 1 before deciding whether to proceed with the investment.
Before we conclude the discussion of decision trees, note that we used the same cost of
capital, 14%, to discount cash flows in the “proceed immediately” scenario analysis in Part
1 and under the “delay 1 year” scenario in Part 2. However, this is not appropriate for three
reasons. First, since there is no possibility of losing money if Murphy delays, the
investment under that plan is clearly less risky than if Murphy charges ahead today. Sec-
ond, the 14% cost of capital might be appropriate for risky cash flows, yet the investment
in the project at Year 1 in Part 2 is known with certainty. Perhaps, then, we should discount
it at the risk-free rate.2 Third, the project’s cash inflows (excluding the initial investment)
are different in Part 2 than in Part 1 because the low-demand cash flows are eliminated.
This suggests that if 14% is the appropriate cost of capital in the “proceed immediately”
case then some lower rate would be appropriate in the “delay decision” case.
In Figure 25-2, Part 1, we repeat the “delay decision” analysis but with one excep-
tion. We continue to discount the operating cash flows in Year 2 through Year 4 at the
14% WACC, but now we discount the project’s cost at Year 1 using the risk-free rate
of 6%. This increases the PV of the cost, which lowers the NPV from $9.36 million to
$6.88 million. Yet we really don’t know the precise WACC for this project—the 14%
we used might be too high or too low for the operating cash flows in Year 2 through
Year 4.3 Therefore, in Part 2 of Figure 25-2 we show a sensitivity analysis of the NPV
2For a more detailed explanation of the rationale behind using the risk-free rate to discount the project
cost, see Timothy A. Luehrman, “Investment Opportunities as Real Options: Getting Started on the
Numbers,” Harvard Business Review, July/August 1998, pp. 51–67. This paper also provides a discussion
of real option valuation. Professor Luehrman also wrote a follow-up paper that provides an excellent dis-
cussion of the ways real options affect strategy: “Strategy as a Portfolio of Real Options,” Harvard Business
Review, September/October 1998, pp. 89–99.
3Murphy might gain information by waiting, which could reduce risk; but if a delay would enable others
to enter and perhaps preempt the market, this could increase risk. In our example, we assumed that Mur-
phy has a patent on critical components of the device, precluding the entrance of a competitor that could
preempt its position in the market.
976
Part 10: Advanced Issues

in which the discount rates used for both the operating cash flows and for the project’s
cost vary. This sensitivity analysis shows that, under all reasonable WACCs, the NPV
of delaying is greater than $1.08 million. This confirms that the option to wait is more
valuable than the $1.08 million NPV resulting from immediate implementation.
Therefore, Murphy should wait rather than implement the project immediately.
Approach 4. Valuing the Timing Option with the
Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model
The decision-tree approach, coupled with a sensitivity analysis, may provide enough
information for a good decision. However, it is often useful to obtain additional insights
into the real option’s value, which means using the fourth procedure, an option pricing
model. To do this, the analyst must find a standard financial option that resembles the

project’s real option.4 As noted earlier, Murphy’s option to delay the project is similar to
a call option on a stock. Hence, the Black-Scholes option pricing model can be used.
This model requires five inputs: (1) the risk-free rate, (2) the time until the option
expires, (3) the strike price, (4) the current price of the stock, and (5) the variance of
the stock’s rate of return. Therefore, we need to estimate values for those five inputs.
First, if we assume that the rate on a 52-week Treasury security is 6%, then this
rate can be used as the risk-free rate. Second, Murphy must decide within a year
whether or not to implement the project, so there is 1 year until the option expires.
Third, it will cost $50 million to implement the project, so $50 million can be used
for the strike price. Fourth, we need a proxy for the value of the underlying asset,
which in Black-Scholes is the current price of the stock. Note that a stock’s current
price is the present value of its expected future cash flows. For Murphy’s real option,
the underlying asset is the project itself, and its current “price” is the present value of
its expected future cash flows. Therefore, as a proxy for the stock price we can use
the present value of the project’s future cash flows. And fifth, the variance of the pro-
ject’s expected return can be used to represent the variance of the stock’s return in
the Black-Scholes model.
Figure 25-3 shows how one can estimate the present value of the project’s cash
inflows. We need to find the current value of the underlying asset—that is, the proj-
ect. For a stock, the current price is the present value of all expected future cash
flows, including those that are expected even if we do not exercise the call option.
Note also that the strike price for a call option has no effect on the stock’s current

4In theory, financial option pricing models apply only to assets that are continuously traded in a market.

Part 10: Advanced Issues

price.5 For our real option, the underlying asset is the delayed project, and its current
“price” is the present value of all its future expected cash flows. Just as the price of a
stock includes all of its future cash flows, so should the present value of the project
include all of its possible future cash flows. Moreover, since the price of a stock is not
affected by the strike price of a call option, we ignore the project’s “strike price,” or
cost, when we find its present value. Figure 25-3 shows the expected cash flows if the
project is delayed. The PV of these cash flows as of now (Year 0) is $44.80 million,
and this is the input we should use for the current price in the Black-Scholes model.
The last required input is the variance of the project’s return. Three different
approaches could be used to estimate this input. First, we could use judgment—an edu-
cated guess. Here we would begin by recalling that a company is a portfolio of projects
(or assets), with each project having its own risk. Since returns on the company’s stock
reflect the diversification gained by combining many projects, we might expect the vari-
ance of the stock’s returns to be lower than the variance of one of its average projects.
The variance of an average company’s stock return is about 12%, so we might expect the
variance for a typical project to be somewhat higher, say, 15% to 25%. Companies in the
Internet infrastructure industry are riskier than average, so we might subjectively esti-
mate the variance of Murphy’s project to be in the range of 18% to 30%.
The second approach, called the direct method, is to estimate the rate of return for
each possible outcome and then calculate the variance of those returns. First, Part 1 in
Figure 25-4 shows the PV for each possible outcome as of Year 1, the time when the
option expires. Here we simply find the present value of all future operating cash flows
discounted back to Year 1, using the WACC of 14%. The Year-1 present value is $76.61
million for high demand, $58.04 million for average demand, and $11.61 million for low
demand. Then, in Part 2, we show the percentage return from the current time until the
option expires for each scenario, based on the $44.80 million starting “price” of the proj-
ect at Year 0 as calculated in Figure 25-3. If demand is high, we will obtain a return of
71.0%: ($76.61 −$44.80)/$44.80 = 0.710 = 71.0%. Similar calculations show returns of
29.5% for average demand and −74.1% for low demand. The expected percentage
return is 14%, the standard deviation is 53.6%, and the variance is 28.7%.6
The third approach for estimating the variance is also based on the scenario data,
but the data are used in a different manner. First, we know that demand is not really
limited to three scenarios; rather, a wide range of outcomes is possible. Similarly, the
stock price at the time a call option expires could take one of many values. It is reason-
able to assume that the value of the project at the time when we must decide on under-
taking it behaves similarly to the price of a stock at the time a call option expires.
Under this assumption, we can use the expected value and standard deviation of the
project’s value to calculate the variance of its rate of return, σ2, with this formula:7
σ2 ¼ lnðCV2 þ 1Þ
t
(25-1)
5The company itself is not involved with traded stock options. However, if the option were a warrant issued
by the company, then the strike price would affect the company’s cash flows and hence its stock price.
6Two points should be made about the percentage return. First, for use in the Black-Scholes model, we need a
percentage return calculated as shown, not an IRR return. The IRR is not used in the option pricing approach.
Second, the expected return comes to 14%, the same as the WACC. This is because the Year-0 price and the
Year-1 PVs were all calculated using the 14% WACC and because we measured return over only 1 year. If we
measure the compound return over more than 1 year, then the average return generally will not equal 14%.

Publishing, 1992).

Part 10: Advanced Issues

Here CV is the coefficient of variation of the underlying asset’s price at the time the
option expires, and t is the time until the option expires. Although the three outcomes in
the scenarios represent a small sample of the many possible outcomes, we can still use
the scenario data to estimate the variance that the project’s rate of return would have if
there were an infinite number of possible outcomes. For Murphy’s project, this indirect
method produces the following estimate of the variance of the project’s return:
σ2 ¼ lnð0:472 þ 1Þ
1
¼ 0:20 ¼ 20%
(25-1a)
Which of the three approaches is best? Obviously, they all involve judgment, so an
analyst might want to consider all three. In our example, all three methods produce
similar estimates, but for illustrative purposes we will simply use 20% as our initial
estimate for the variance of the project’s rate of return.
In Part 1 of Figure 25-5, we calculate the value of the option to defer investment
in the project based on the Black-Scholes model, and the result is $7.04 million.

Since this is significantly higher than the $1.08 million NPV under immediate imple-
mentation and since the option would be forfeited if Murphy goes ahead right now,
we conclude as before that the company should defer the final decision until more
information is available.
Because judgmental estimates were made at many points in the analysis, it would
be useful to see how sensitive the final outcome is to certain of the key inputs.
Therefore, in Part 2 of Figure 25-5 we show the sensitivity of the option’s value to
different estimates of the variance. It is reassuring to see that, for all reasonable esti-
mates of variance, the option to delay remains more valuable than immediate
implementation.
Approach 5. Financial Engineering
Sometimes an analyst might not be satisfied with the results of a decision-tree analy-
sis and cannot find a standard financial option that corresponds to the real option. In
such a situation the only alternative is to develop a unique model for the specific real
option being analyzed, a process called financial engineering. When financial engi-
neering is applied on Wall Street, where it was developed, the result is a newly
designed financial product.8 When it is applied to real options, the result is the value
of a project that contains embedded options.
Although financial engineering was originally developed on Wall Street, many
financial engineering techniques have been applied to real options during the last 10
years. We expect this trend to continue, especially in light of the rapid improvements
in computer processing speed and spreadsheet software capabilities. One financial
engineering technique is called risk-neutral valuation. This technique uses simula-
tion, and we discuss it in Web Extension 25B. Most other financial engineering tech-
niques are too complicated for a course in financial management, so we leave a
detailed discussion of them to a specialized course.

25.3 THE GROWTH OPTION: AN ILLUSTRATION
As we saw with the investment timing option, there is frequently an alternative to
merely accepting or rejecting a static project. Many investment opportunities, if
successful, lead to other investment opportunities. The production capacity of a suc-
cessful product line can later be expanded to satisfy increased demand, or distribution
can be extended to new geographic markets. A company with a successful name
brand can capitalize on its success by adding complementary or new products under
the same brand. These growth options add value to a project and explain, for exam-
ple, why companies are flocking to make inroads into the very difficult business envi-
ronment in China.
Kidco Corporation designs and manufactures products aimed at the pre-teen mar-
ket. Most of its products have a very short life, given the rapidly changing tastes of
pre-teens. Kidco is now considering a project that will cost $30 million. Management
believes there is a 25% chance that the project will “take off” and generate operating
cash flows of $34 million in each of the next 2 years, after which pre-teen tastes will
change and the project will be terminated. There is a 50% chance of average
demand, in which case cash flows will be $20 million annually for 2 years. Finally,
8Financial engineering techniques are widely used for the creation and valuation of derivative securities.

Part 10: Advanced Issues

there is a 25% chance that the pre-teens won’t like the product at all, and it will gen-
erate cash flows of only $2 million per year. The estimated cost of capital for the
project is 14%.
Based on its experience with other projects, Kidco believes it will be able to launch
a second-generation product if demand for the original product is average or above.
This second-generation product will cost the same as the first-generation product,
$30 million, and the cost will be incurred at Year 2. However, given the success of
the first-generation product, Kidco believes that the second-generation product
would be just as successful as the first-generation product.
This growth option resembles a call option on a stock, since it gives Kidco the
opportunity to “purchase” a successful follow-on project at a fixed cost if the value
of the project is greater than the cost. Otherwise, Kidco will let the option expire
by not implementing the second-generation product.
The following sections apply the first four valuation approaches: (1) DCF, (2)
DCF and qualitative assessment, (3) decision-tree analysis, and (4) analysis with a
standard financial option.
Approach 1. DCF Analysis Ignoring the Growth Option
Based on probabilities for the different levels of demand, the expected annual operat-
ing cash flows for the project are $19 million per year:
0:25ð$34Þ þ 0:50ð$20Þ þ 0:25ð$2Þ ¼ $19:00
Ignoring the investment timing option, the traditional NPV is $1.29 million:
NPV ¼ −$30 þ
$19
ð1 þ 0:14Þ1 þ
$19
ð1 þ 0:14Þ2 ¼ $1:29
Based on this DCF analysis, Kidco should accept the project.
Approach 2. DCF Analysis with a Qualitative
Consideration of the Growth Option
Although the DCF analysis indicates that the project should be accepted, it ignores a
potentially valuable real option. The option’s time to maturity and the volatility of
the underlying project provide qualitative insights into the option’s value. Kidco’s
growth option has 2 years until maturity, which is a relatively long time, and the
cash flows of the project are volatile. Taken together, this qualitative assessment
indicates that the growth option should be quite valuable.
Approach 3. Decision-Tree Analysis of the Growth Option
Part 1 of Figure 25-6 shows a scenario analysis for Kidco’s project. The top line, which
describes the payoffs for the high-demand scenario, has operating cash flows of $34 mil-
lion for the next 2 years. The NPV of this branch is $25.99 million. The NPV of the
average-demand branch in the middle is $2.93 million, and it is −$26.71 million for the
low-demand scenario. The sum in the last column of Part 1 shows the expected NPV of
$1.29 million. The coefficient of variation is 14.54, indicating that the project is very risky.
Part 2 of Figure 25-6 shows a decision-tree analysis in which Kidco undertakes the
second-generation product only if demand is average or high. In these scenarios,
shown on the top two branches of the decision tree, Kidco will incur a cost of
$30 million at Year 2 and receive operating cash flows of either $34 million or $20
million for the next 2 years, depending on the level of demand. If the demand is low,
Chapter 25: Real Options
983

shown on the bottom branch, Kidco has no cost at Year 2 and receives no additional
cash flows in subsequent years. All operating cash flows (which do not include the
cost of implementing the second-generation project at Year 2) are discounted at the
WACC of 14%. Because the $30 million implementation cost is known, it is dis-
counted at the risk-free rate of 6%. As shown in Part 2 of Figure 25-6, the expected
NPV is $4.70 million, indicating that the growth option is quite valuable.

Notes:
aThe operating cash flows are discounted by the WACC of 14%.
bThe standard deviation is calculated as in Chapter 6.
cThe coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the expected value.
dThe total cash flows at Year 2 are equal to the operating cash flows for the first-generation product minus the $30 million cost to
implement the second-generation product, if the firm chooses to do so. For example, the Year-2 cash flow in the high-demand
scenario is $34 −$30 = $4 million. Based on Part 1, it makes economic sense to implement the second-generation product only if
demand is high or average.
eThe operating cash flows in Year 1 through Year 2, which do not include the $30 million cost of implementing the second-generation
project at Year 2 for the high-demand and average-demand scenarios, are discounted at the WACC of 14%. The $30 million implemen-
tation cost at Year 2 for the high-demand and average-demand scenarios is discounted at the risk-free rate of 6%.
984
Part 10: Advanced Issues

The option itself alters the risk of the project, which means that 14% is probably
not the appropriate cost of capital. Table 25-1 presents the results of a sensitivity
analysis in which the cost of capital for the operating cash flows varies from 8% to
18%. The sensitivity analysis also allows the rate used to discount the implementa-
tion cost at Year 2 to vary from 3% to 9%. The resulting NPV is positive for all
reasonable combinations of discount rates.
Approach 4. Valuing the Growth Option with the
Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model
The fourth approach is to use a standard model for a corresponding financial option.
As we noted earlier, Kidco’s growth option is similar to a call option on a stock, so
we will use the Black-Scholes model to find the value of the growth option. The time
until the growth option expires is 2 years. The rate on a 2-year Treasury security is
6%, and this provides a good estimate of the risk-free rate. Implementing the project
will cost $30 million, which is the strike price.
The input for stock price in the Black-Scholes model is the current value of the
underlying asset. For the growth option, the underlying asset is the second-
generation project, and its current value is the present value of its cash flows. The
calculations in Figure 25-7 show that this value is $24.07 million. Because the strike
price of $30 million is greater than the current “price” of $24.07 million, the growth
option is currently out-of-the-money.
Figure 25-8 shows the estimates for the variance of the project’s rate of return using
the two methods described earlier in the chapter for the analysis of the investment
timing option. The direct method, shown in Part 2 of the figure, produces an estimate
of 17.9% for the variance of return. The indirect method, in Part 3, estimates the vari-
ance as 15.3%. Both estimates are somewhat higher than the 12% variance of a typical
company’s stock return, which is consistent with the idea that a project’s variance is
higher than a stock’s because of diversification effects. Thus, an estimated variance of
15% to 20% seems reasonable. We use an initial estimate of 15.3% in our initial appli-
cation of the Black-Scholes model, shown in Part 1 of Figure 25-9.

Chapter 25: Real Options

Using the Black-Scholes model for a call option, Figure 25-9 shows a $4.34 million
value for the growth option. The total NPV is the sum of the first-generation project’s
NPV and the value of the growth option: Total NPV = $1.29 + $4.34 = $5.63 million,
which is much higher than the NPV of the first-generation project alone. As this
analysis shows, the growth option adds considerable value to the original project. In
addition, the sensitivity analysis in Part 2 of Figure 25-9 indicates that the growth
option’s value is large for all reasonable values of variance. Kidco should therefore
accept the project.

25.4 CONCLUDING THOUGHTS ON REAL OPTIONS
We don’t deny that real options can be pretty complicated. Keep in mind, however,
that 50 years ago very few companies used NPV because it seemed too complicated.
Now NPV is a basic tool used by virtually all companies and taught in all business
schools. A similar but more rapid pattern of adoption is occurring with real options.
Ten years ago very few companies used real options, but a recent survey of CFOs
reported that more than 26% of companies now use real option techniques when
evaluating projects.9 Just as with NPV, it’s only a matter of time before virtually all
companies use real option techniques.

We have provided you with some basic tools necessary for evaluating real options,
starting with the ability to identify real options and make qualitative assessments
regarding a real option’s value. Decision trees are another important tool, since they
facilitate an explicit identification of the embedded options, which is critical in the
decision-making process. However, keep in mind that the decision tree should not
use the original project’s cost of capital. Although finance theory has not yet
provided a way to estimate the appropriate cost of capital for a decision tree,
sensitivity analysis can identify the effect that different costs of capital have on the
project’s value.
Many real options can be analyzed using a standard model for an existing financial
option, such as the Black-Scholes model for calls and puts. There are also other
financial models for a variety of options. These include the option to exchange one
asset for another, the option to purchase the minimum or the maximum of two or

more assets, the option on an average of several assets, and even an option on an
option.10 In fact, there are entire textbooks that describe even more options.11 Given
the large number of standard models for existing financial options, it is often possible
to find a financial option that resembles the real option being analyzed.
Sometimes there are some real options that don’t resemble any financial options.
But the good news is that many of these options can be valued using techniques from
financial engineering. This is frequently the case if there is a traded financial asset
that matches the risk of the real option. For example, many oil companies use oil
futures contracts to price the real options that are embedded in various exploration
and leasing strategies. With the explosion in the markets for derivatives, there are
now financial contracts that span an incredible variety of risks. This means that an
ever-increasing number of real options can be valued using these financial instru-
ments. Most financial engineering techniques are beyond the scope of this book,
but Web Extension 25B on the textbook’s Web site describes one particularly useful
financial engineering technique called risk-neutral valuation.12

Summary
In this chapter we discussed some topics that go beyond the simple capital budgeting
framework, including the following.
•
Investing in a new project often brings with it a potential increase in the firm’s
future opportunities. Opportunities are, in effect, options—the right but not the
obligation to take some future action.
•
A project may have an option value that is not accounted for in a conventional
NPV analysis. Any project that expands the firm’s set of opportunities has posi-
tive option value.
•
Real options are opportunities for management to respond to changes in market
conditions and involve “real” rather than “financial” assets.

only, and ignore the real option; (2) DCF analysis and a qualitative assessment of
the real option’s value; (3) decision-tree analysis; (4) analysis with a standard
model for an existing financial option; and (5) financial engineering techniques.

Katie Watkins, an entrepreneur, believes that consolidation is the key to profit in the
fragmented recreational equine industry. In particular, she is considering starting a
business that will develop and sell franchises to other owner-operators, who will
then board and train hunter-jumper horses. The initial cost to develop and imple-
ment the franchise concept is $8 million. She estimates a 25% probability of high
demand for the concept, in which case she will receive cash flows of $13 million at
the end of each year for the next 2 years. She estimates a 50% probability of medium
demand, in which case the annual cash flows will be $7 million for 2 years, and a
25% probability of low demand with an annual cash flow of $1 million for 2 years.
She estimates the appropriate cost of capital is 15%. The risk-free rate is 6%.
a. Find the NPV of each scenario, and then find the expected NPV.
b. Now assume that the expertise gained by taking on the project will lead to an
opportunity at the end of Year 2 to undertake a similar venture that will have the
same cost as the original project. The new project’s cash flows would follow
whichever branch resulted for the original project. In other words, there would
be an $8 million cost at the end of Year 2 and then cash flows of $13 million,
$7 million, or $1 million for Years 3 and 4. Use decision-tree analysis to estimate
the combined value of the original project and the additional project (but imple-
ment the additional project only if it is optimal to do so). Assume that the
$8 million cost at Year 2 is known with certainty and should be discounted at

the risk-free rate of 6%. (Hint: Do one decision tree that discounts the operating
cash flows at the 15% cost of capital and another decision tree that discounts the
costs of the projects—that is, the costs at Year 0 and Year 2—at the risk-free rate
of 6%; then sum the two decision trees to find the total NPV.)
c. Instead of using decision-tree analysis, use the Black-Scholes model to
estimate the value of the growth option. Assume that the variance of the
project’s rate of return is 15%. Find the total value of the project with
the option to expand—that is, the sum of the original expected value and
the growth option. (Hint: You will need to find the expected present value of
the additional project’s operating cash flows in order to estimate the current
price of the option’s underlying asset.)

Kim Hotels is interested in developing a new hotel in Seoul. The company estimates
that the hotel would require an initial investment of $20 million. Kim expects the
hotel will produce positive cash flows of $3 million a year at the end of each of the
next 20 years. The project’s cost of capital is 13%.
a. What is the project’s net present value?
b. Kim expects the cash flows to be $3 million a year, but it recognizes that the cash
flows could actually be much higher or lower, depending on whether the Korean
government imposes a large hotel tax. One year from now, Kim will know
whether the tax will be imposed. There is a 50% chance that the tax will be im-
posed, in which case the yearly cash flows will be only $2.2 million. At the same
time, there is a 50% chance that the tax will not be imposed, in which case the
yearly cash flows will be $3.8 million. Kim is deciding whether to proceed with
the hotel today or to wait a year to find out whether the tax will be imposed. If
Kim waits a year, the initial investment will remain at $20 million. Assume that
all cash flows are discounted at 13%. Use decision-tree analysis to determine
whether Kim should proceed with the project today or wait a year before
deciding.

The Karns Oil Company is deciding whether to drill for oil on a tract of land the
company owns. The company estimates the project would cost $8 million today.
Karns estimates that, once drilled, the oil will generate positive net cash flows of $4
million a year at the end of each of the next 4 years. Although the company is fairly
confident about its cash flow forecast, in 2 years it will have more information about
the local geology and about the price of oil. Karns estimates that if it waits 2 years
then the project would cost $9 million. Moreover, if it waits 2 years, then there is a
90% chance that the net cash flows would be $4.2 million a year for 4 years and a
10% chance that they would be $2.2 million a year for 4 years. Assume all cash flows
are discounted at 10%.
a. If the company chooses to drill today, what is the project’s net present value?
b. Using decision-tree analysis, does it make sense to wait 2 years before deciding

Hart Lumber is considering the purchase of a paper company, which would require
an initial investment of $300 million. Hart estimates that the paper company would
provide net cash flows of $40 million at the end of each of the next 20 years. The
cost of capital for the paper company is 13%.
a. Should Hart purchase the paper company?
b. Hart’s best guess is that cash flows will be $40 million a year, but it realizes
that the cash flows are as likely to be $30 million a year as $50 million. One
year from now, it will find out whether the cash flows will be $30 million or
$50 million. In addition, Hart could sell the paper company at Year 3 for $280
million. Given this additional information, does decision-tree analysis indicate
that it makes sense to purchase the paper company? Again, assume that all cash

Utah Enterprises is considering buying a vacant lot that sells for $1.2 million. If the
property is purchased, the company’s plan is to spend another $5 million today (t = 0)
to build a hotel on the property. The after-tax cash flows from the hotel will depend
critically on whether the state imposes a tourism tax in this year’s legislative session.
If the tax is imposed, the hotel is expected to produce after-tax cash inflows of
$600,000 at the end of each of the next 15 years, versus $1,200,00 if the tax is not
imposed. The project has a 12% cost of capital. Assume at the outset that the com-
pany does not have the option to delay the project. Use decision-tree analysis to
answer the following questions.
a. What is the project’s expected NPV if the tax is imposed?
b. What is the project’s expected NPV if the tax is not imposed?
c. Given that there is a 50% chance that the tax will be imposed, what is the
project’s expected NPV if the company proceeds with it today?
d. Although the company does not have an option to delay construction, it does
have the option to abandon the project 1 year from now if the tax is imposed. If
it abandons the project, it would sell the complete property 1 year from now at
an expected price of $6 million. Once the project is abandoned, the company
would no longer receive any cash inflows from it. If all cash flows are discounted
at 12%, would the existence of this abandonment option affect the company’s
decision to proceed with the project today?
e. Assume there is no option to abandon or delay the project but that the
company has an option to purchase an adjacent property in 1 year at a price of
$1.5 million. If the tourism tax is imposed, then the net present value of devel-
oping this property (as of t = 1) is only $300,000 (so it wouldn’t make sense to
purchase the property for $1.5 million). However, if the tax is not imposed, then
the net present value of the future opportunities from developing the property
would be $4 million (as of t = 1). Thus, under this scenario it would make sense
to purchase the property for $1.5 million. Given that cash flows are discounted at
12% and that there’s a 50-50 chance the tax will be imposed, how much would
the company pay today for the option to purchase this property 1 year from now
for $1.5 million?

a. What is the expected NPV of the project?
b. If Fethe makes the investment today, then it will have the option to renew the
franchise fee for 2 more years at the end of Year 2 for an additional payment
of $20,000. In this case, the cash flows that occurred in Years 1 and 2 will be
repeated (so if demand was good in Years 1 and 2, it will continue to be good in
Years 3 and 4). Write out the decision tree and use decision-tree analysis to cal-
culate the expected NPV of this project, including the option to continue for an
additional 2 years. Note: The franchise fee payment at the end of Year 2 is
known, so it should be discounted at the risk-free rate, which is 6%.

Start with the partial model in the file Ch25 P09 Build a Model.xls on the textbook’s
Web site. Bradford Services Inc. (BSI) is considering a project with a cost of $10 million
and an expected life of 3 years. There is a 30% probability of good conditions, in which
case the project will provide a cash flow of $9 million at the end of each of the next
3 years. There is a 40% probability of medium conditions, in which case the annual cash
flows will be $4 million, and there is a 30% probability of bad conditions with a cash flow
of −$1 million per year. BSI uses a 12% cost of capital to evaluate projects like this.
a. Find the project’s expected present value, NPV, and the coefficient of variation
of the present value.
b. Now suppose that BSI can abandon the project at the end of the first year by
selling it for $6 million. BSI will still receive the Year-1 cash flows, but will
receive no cash flows in subsequent years.
c. Now assume that the project cannot be shut down. However, expertise gained by
taking it on would lead to an opportunity at the end of Year 3 to undertake a
venture that would have the same cost as the original project, and the new pro-
ject’s cash flows would follow whichever branch resulted for the original project.
In other words, there would be a second $10 million cost at the end of Year 3
followed by cash flows of either $9 million, $4 million, or −$1 million for the
subsequent 3 years. Use decision-tree analysis to estimate the value of the proj-
ect, including the opportunity to implement the new project at Year 3. Assume
that the $10 million cost at Year 3 is known with certainty and should be dis-
counted at the risk-free rate of 6%.
d. Now suppose the original project (no abandonment option or additional growth
option) could be delayed a year. All the cash flows would remain unchanged, but
information obtained during that year would tell the company exactly which set

of demand conditions existed. Use decision-tree analysis to estimate the value of
the project if it is delayed by 1 year. (Hint: Discount the $10 million cost at the
risk-free rate of 6% because the cost is known with certainty.)
e. Go back to part c. Instead of using decision-tree analysis, use the Black-Scholes
model to estimate the value of the growth option. The risk-free rate is 6%, and
the variance of the project’s rate of return is 22%.
Mini Case
Assume you have just been hired as a financial analyst by Tropical Sweets Inc., a mid-sized
California company that specializes in creating exotic candies from tropical fruits such as man-
goes, papayas, and dates. The firm’s CEO, George Yamaguchi, recently returned from an
industry corporate executive conference in San Francisco, and one of the sessions he attended
addressed real options. Because no one at Tropical Sweets is familiar with the basics of real
options, Yamaguchi has asked you to prepare a brief report that the firm’s executives can use
to gain at least a cursory understanding of the topic.
To begin, you gathered some outside materials on the subject and used these materials to
draft a list of pertinent questions that need to be answered. Now that the questions have
been drafted, you must develop the answers.
a. What are some types of real options?
b. What are five possible procedures for analyzing a real option?
c. Tropical Sweets is considering a project that will cost $70 million and will generate
expected cash flows of $30 million per year for 3 years. The cost of capital for this type
of project is 10%, and the risk-free rate is 6%. After discussions with the marketing
department, you learn that there is a 30% chance of high demand with associated future
cash flows of $45 million per year. There is also a 40% chance of average demand with
cash flows of $30 million per year as well as a 30% chance of low demand with cash
flows of only $15 million per year. What is the expected NPV?
d. Now suppose this project has an investment timing option, since it can be delayed for a
year. The cost will still be $70 million at the end of the year, and the cash flows for the
scenarios will still last 3 years. However, Tropical Sweets will know the level of demand
and will implement the project only if it adds value to the company. Perform a qualita-
tive assessment of the investment timing option’s value.
e. Use decision-tree analysis to calculate the NPV of the project with the investment
timing option.
f. Use a financial option pricing model to estimate the value of the investment timing
option.
g. Now suppose that the cost of the project is $75 million and the project cannot be
delayed. However, if Tropical Sweets implements the project then the firm will have a
growth option: the opportunity to replicate the original project at the end of its life.
What is the total expected NPV of the two projects if both are implemented?
h. Tropical Sweets will replicate the original project only if demand is high. Using
decision-tree analysis, estimate the value of the project with the growth option.
i. Use a financial option model to estimate the value of the project with the growth
option.
j. What happens to the value of the growth option if the variance of the project’s return is
14.2%? What if it is 50%? How might this explain the high valuations of many startup
high-tech companies that have yet to show positive earnings?

Analysis of Capital Structure
Theory
A
t a meeting of the Financial Management Association, a panel session
focused on how firms actually set their target capital structures. The
participants included financial managers from Hershey Foods, Verizon,
EG&G (a high-tech firm), and a number of other firms in various industries.
Although there were minor differences in philosophy and procedures
among the companies, several themes emerged.
First, in practice it is difficult to specify an optimal capital structure—
indeed, managers feel uncomfortable even about specifying an optimal
capital structure range. Thus, financial managers worry primarily about
whether their firms are using too little or too much debt, not about the
precise optimal amount of debt. Second, even if a firm’s actual capital
structure varies widely from the theoretical optimum, this might not have
much effect on its stock price. Overall, financial managers believe that
capital structure decisions are secondary in importance to operating
decisions, especially those relating to capital budgeting and the strategic
direction of the firm.
In general, financial managers focus on identifying a “prudent” level of
debt rather than on setting a precise optimal level. A prudent level is
defined as one that captures most of the benefits of debt yet (1) keeps
financial risk at a manageable level, (2) ensures future financing flexibility,
and (3) allows the firm to maintain a desirable credit rating. Thus, a
prudent level of debt will protect the company against financial distress
under all but the worst economic scenarios, and it will ensure access to
money and capital markets under most conditions.
As you read this chapter, think about how you would make capital
structure decisions if you had that responsibility. At the same time, don’t
forget
the
very important
message
from
the
FMA panel
session:
Establishing the right capital structure is an imprecise process at best, and
it should be based on both informed judgment and quantitative analyses.
995

Chapter 15 presented basic material on capital structure, including an introduction to
capital structure theory. We saw that debt concentrates a firm’s business risk on its
stockholders, thus raising stockholders’ risk, but it also increases the expected return
on equity. We also saw there is some optimal level of debt that maximizes a company’s
stock price, and we illustrated this concept with a simple model. Now we go into more
detail on capital structure theory. This will give you a deeper understanding of the
benefits and costs associated with debt financing.
26.1 CAPITAL STRUCTURE THEORY: ARBITRAGE
PROOFS OF THE MODIGLIANI-MILLER MODELS
Until 1958, capital structure theory consisted of loose assertions about investor behavior
rather than carefully constructed models that could be tested by formal statistical analy-
sis. In what has been called the most influential set of financial papers ever published,
Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller (MM) addressed capital structure in a rigorous,
scientific fashion, and they set off a chain of research that continues to this day.1
Corporate Valuation and Capital Structure Decisions
A firm’s financing choices obviously have a direct effect
on its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Financ-
ing choices also have an indirect effect because they
change the risk and required return of debt and equity.
This chapter focuses on the debt–equity choice and its
effect on value.

Part 10: Advanced Issues

Assumptions
As we explain in this chapter, MM employed the concept of arbitrage to develop
their theory. Arbitrage occurs if two similar assets—in this case, levered and unlev-
ered stocks—sell at different prices. Arbitrageurs will buy the undervalued stock and
simultaneously sell the overvalued stock, earning a profit in the process, and will con-
tinue doing so until market forces of supply and demand cause the prices of the two
assets to be equal. For arbitrage to work, the assets must be equivalent, or nearly so.
MM show that, under their assumptions, levered and unlevered stocks are sufficiently
similar for the arbitrage process to operate.
No one, not even MM, believes their assumptions are sufficiently correct that
their models will hold exactly in the real world. However, their models do show
how money can be made through arbitrage if one can find ways around problems
with the assumptions. Though some of them were later relaxed, here are the initial
MM assumptions.
1. There are no taxes, either personal or corporate.
2. Business risk can be measured by σEBIT, and firms with the same degree of busi-
ness risk are said to be in a homogeneous risk class.
3. All present and prospective investors have identical estimates of each firm’s future
EBIT; that is, investors have homogeneous expectations about expected future cor-
porate earnings and the riskiness of those earnings.
4. Stocks and bonds are traded in perfect capital markets. This assumption implies,
among other things, (a) that there are no brokerage costs and (b) that investors
(both individuals and institutions) can borrow at the same rate as corporations.
5. Debt is riskless. This applies to both firms and investors, so the interest rate on all
debt is the risk-free rate. Further, this situation holds regardless of how much
debt a firm (or individual) uses.
6. All cash flows are perpetuities; that is, all firms expect zero growth and hence
have an “expectationally constant” EBIT, and all bonds are perpetuities. “Expec-
tationally constant” means that the best guess is that EBIT will be constant,
although after the fact the realized level could be different from the expected level.
MM without Taxes
MM first analyzed leverage under the assumption that there are no corporate or per-
sonal income taxes. On the basis of their assumptions, they stated and algebraically
proved two propositions.2
Proposition I.
The value of any firm is established by capitalizing its expected net
operating income (EBIT) at a constant rate (rsU) that is based on the firm’s risk class:
VL ¼ VU ¼ EBIT
WACC ¼ EBIT
rsU
(26-1)
Here the subscript L designates a levered firm and U designates an unlevered firm.
Both firms are assumed to be in the same business risk class, and rsU is the required
rate of return for an unlevered (i.e., all-equity) firm of this risk class when there are
no taxes. For our purposes, it is easiest to think in terms of a single firm that has the
2Modigliani and Miller actually stated and proved three propositions, but the third one is not material to
our discussion here.
Chapter 26: Analysis of Capital Structure Theory
997

option of financing either with all equity or with some combination of debt and eq-
uity. Hence, L designates a firm that uses some amount of debt and U designates a
firm that uses no debt.
As established by Equation 26-1, V is a constant; therefore, under the MM model, if
there are no taxes then the value of the firm is independent of its leverage. As we shall see,
this also implies the following statements.
1. The weighted average cost of capital, WACC, is completely independent of a
firm’s capital structure.
2. Regardless of the amount of debt a firm uses, its WACC is equal to the cost of
equity that it would have if it used no debt.
Proposition II.
When there are no taxes, the cost of equity to a levered firm, rsL, is
equal to (1) the cost of equity to an unlevered firm in the same risk class, rsU, plus (2)
a risk premium whose size depends on (a) the difference between an unlevered firm’s
costs of debt and equity and (b) the amount of debt used:
rsL ¼ rsU þ Risk premium ¼ rsU þ ðrsU −rdÞðD=SÞ
(26-2)
Here D is the market value of the firm’s debt, S is the market value of its equity, and
rd is the constant cost of debt. Equation 26-2 states that, as debt increases, the cost
of equity rises in a mathematically precise manner (even though the cost of debt does
not rise).
Taken together, the two MM propositions imply that using more debt in the cap-
ital structure will not increase the value of the firm, because the benefits of cheaper
debt will be exactly offset by an increase in the riskiness of the equity and hence in its
cost. Thus MM argue that, in a world without taxes, both the value of a firm and its
WACC would be unaffected by its capital structure.
MM’s Arbitrage Proof
Propositions I and II are important because they showed for the first time that any val-
uation effects due to the use of debt must arise from taxes or other market frictions.
The technique that MM used to prove these propositions is equally important, how-
ever, so we discuss it in detail here. They used an arbitrage proof to support their pro-
positions, and this proof technique was later used in the development of option pricing
models that revolutionized the securities industry.3 Modigliani and Miller showed that,
under their assumptions, if two companies differed only (1) in the way they were
financed and (2) in their total market values, then investors would sell shares of the
higher-valued firm, buy those of the lower-valued firm, and continue this process until
the companies had exactly the same market value. To illustrate, assume that two firms,
L and U, are identical in all important respects except that Firm L has $4,000,000
of 7.5% debt while Firm U uses only equity. Both firms have EBIT = $900,000, and
σEBIT is the same for both firms, so they are in the same business risk class.
Modigliani and Miller assumed that all firms are in a zero-growth situation. In
other words, EBIT is expected to remain constant; this will occur if ROE is constant,
3By arbitrage we mean the simultaneous buying and selling of essentially identical assets that sell at differ-
ent prices. The buying increases the price of the undervalued asset, and the selling decreases the price of
the overvalued asset. Arbitrage operations will continue until prices have adjusted to the point where the
arbitrageur can no longer earn a profit, at which point the market is in equilibrium. In the absence of
transaction costs, equilibrium requires that the prices of the two assets be equal.

Part 10: Advanced Issues

all earnings are paid out as dividends, and there are no taxes. Under the constant
EBIT assumption, the total market value of the common stock, S, is the present value
of a perpetuity, which is found as follows:
S ¼ Dividends
rsL
¼ Net income
rsL
¼ EBIT −rdD
rsL
(26-3)
Equation 26-3 is merely the value of a perpetuity, where the numerator is the net
income available to common stockholders (all of which is paid out as dividends)
and the denominator is the cost of common equity. Since there are no taxes, the
numerator is not multiplied by (1 −T), as it was when we calculated NOPAT in
Chapters 2 and 13.
Assume that initially, before any arbitrage occurs, both firms have the same equity
capitalization rate: rsU = rsL = 10%. Under this condition, according to Equation
26-3, the following situation would exist.
Firm U:
Value of Firm U’s stock ¼ SU ¼ EBIT −rdD
rsU
¼ $900; 000−$0
0:10
¼ $9;000;000
Total market value of Firm U ¼ VU ¼ DU þ SU ¼ $0 þ $9;000;000
¼ $9;000;000
Firm L:
Value of Firm L’s stock ¼ SL ¼ EBIT −rdD

¼ $900; 000 −0:075ð$4;000;000Þ

¼ $6;000;000
Total market value of Firm L ¼ VL ¼ DL þ SL ¼ $4;000;000 þ $6;000;000
¼ $10; 000; 000
Thus, before arbitrage (and assuming that rsU = rsL, which implies that capital struc-
ture has no effect on the cost of equity), the value of the levered Firm L exceeds that
of the unlevered Firm U.
Modigliani and Miller argued that this result is a disequilibrium that cannot persist.
To see why, suppose you owned 10% of L’s stock and so the market value of your
investment was 0.10($6,000,000) = $600,000. According to MM, you could increase
your income without increasing your exposure to risk. For example, you could (1) sell
your stock in L for $600,000, (2) borrow an amount equal to 10% of L’s debt
($400,000), and then (3) buy 10% of U’s stock for $900,000. Note that you would
receive $1,000,000 from the sale of your 10% of L’s stock plus your borrowing, and
you would be spending only $900,000 on U’s stock. Hence you would have an extra
$100,000, which you could invest in riskless debt to yield 7.5%, or $7,500 annually.

Now consider your income positions:
Old Portfolio
New Portfolio
10% of L’s $600,000
equity income
$60,000
10% of U’s $900,000
equity income
$90,000
Less 7.5% interest on $400,000 loan
(30,000)
Plus 7.5% interest on extra $100,000
7,500
Total income
$60,000
Total income
$67,500
Thus, your net income from common stock would be exactly the same as before,
$60,000, but you would have $100,000 left over for investment in riskless debt and
this would increase your income by $7,500. Therefore, the total return on your
$600,000 net worth would rise to $67,500. And your risk, according to MM, would
be the same as before, because you would have simply substituted $400,000 of “home-
made” leverage for your 10% share of Firm L’s $4 million of corporate leverage. Thus,
neither your “effective” debt nor your risk would have changed. Therefore, you would
have increased your income without raising your risk, which is obviously desirable.
Modigliani and Miller argued that this arbitrage process would actually occur,
with sales of L’s stock driving its price down and purchases of U’s stock driving its
price up, until the market values of the two firms were equal. Until this equality was
established, gains could be obtained by switching from one stock to the other; hence
the profit motive would force equality to be reached. When equilibrium is estab-
lished, the values of Firms L and U must be equal, which is what Proposition I states.
If their values are equal, then Equation 26-1 implies that WACC = rSU. Because
there are no taxes, we have
WACC ¼ ½D=ðD þ SÞrd þ ½S=ðD þ SÞrSL
and a little algebra then yields
rsL¼ rsU þ ðrsU −rdÞðD=SÞ
which is what Proposition II states. Thus, according to MM, both a firm’s value and
its WACC must be independent of capital structure.
Note that each of the assumptions listed at the beginning of this section is neces-
sary for the arbitrage proof to work exactly. For example, if the companies did not
have identical business risk or if transaction costs were significant, then the arbitrage
process could not be invoked. We discuss other implications of the assumptions later
in the chapter.
Arbitrage with Short Sales
Even if you did not own any stock in L, you still could reap benefits if U and L did
not have the same total market value. Your first step would be to sell short $600,000
of stock in L. To do this, your broker would let you borrow stock in L from another
client. Your broker would then sell the stock for you and give you the proceeds, or
$600,000 in cash. You would supplement this $600,000 by borrowing $400,000. With
the $1 million total, you would buy 10% of the stock in U for $900,000 and have
$100,000 remaining.
Your position would then consist of $100,000 in cash and two portfolios. The first
portfolio would contain $900,000 of stock in U, which would generate $90,000 of
income. Because you would own the stock, we’ll call it the “long” portfolio. The
1000
Part 10: Advanced Issues

other portfolio would consist of $600,000 of stock in L and $400,000 of debt. The
value of this portfolio is $1 million, and it would generate $60,000 of dividends and
$30,000 of interest. However, you would not own this second portfolio—you would
“owe” it. Since you borrowed the $400,000, you would owe the $30,000 in interest.
And since you borrowed the stock in L, you would “owe the stock” to the client from
whom it was borrowed. Therefore, you would have to pay your broker the $60,000
of dividends paid by L, which the broker would then pass on to the client from
whom the stock was borrowed. Thus your net cash flow from the second portfolio
would be a negative $90,000. Because you would “owe” this portfolio, we’ll call it
the “short” portfolio.
Where would you get the $90,000 that you must pay on the short portfolio? The
good news is that this is exactly the amount of cash flow generated by your long
portfolio. Because the cash flows generated by each portfolio are the same, the short
portfolio “replicates” the long portfolio.
Here is the bottom line. You started out with no money of your own. By selling L
short, borrowing $400,000, and purchasing stock in U, you ended up with $100,000
in cash plus the two portfolios. The portfolios mirror one another, so their net cash
flow is zero. This is perfect arbitrage: You invest none of your own money, you have
no risk, you have no future negative cash flows, but you end up with cash in your
pocket.
Not surprisingly, many traders would want to do this. The selling pressure on L
would cause its price to fall, and the buying pressure on U would cause its price to
rise, until the two companies’ values were equal. To put it another way, if the long and
short replicating portfolios have the same cash flows, then arbitrage will force them to have
the same value.
This is one of the most important ideas in modern finance. Not only does it give
us insights into capital structure, but it is the fundamental building block underlying
the valuation of real and financial options and derivatives as discussed in Chapter 8
and 23. Without the concept of arbitrage, the options and derivatives markets we
have today simply would not exist.
MM with Corporate Taxes
Modigliani and Miller’s original work, published in 1958, assumed zero taxes. In
1963, they published a second article that incorporated corporate taxes. With corpo-
rate income taxes, they concluded that leverage will increase a firm’s value. This
occurs because interest is a tax-deductible expense; hence more of a levered firm’s
operating income flows through to investors.
Later in this chapter we present a proof of the MM propositions when personal
taxes as well as corporate taxes are allowed. The situation when there are corporate
taxes but no personal taxes is a special instance of the situation with both personal
and corporate taxes, so we only present results in this case.
Proposition I.
The value of a levered firm is equal to the value of an unlevered
firm in the same risk class (VU) plus the value of the tax shield (VTax shield) due to
the tax deductibility of interest expenses. The value of the tax shield, which is
often called the gain from leverage, is the present value of the annual tax savings.
The annual tax saving is equal to the interest payment multiplied by the tax
rate, T:
Annual tax saving ¼ rdDðTÞ
Chapter 26: Analysis of Capital Structure Theory
1001

Modigliani and Miller assume a no-growth firm, so the present value of the annual
tax saving is the present value of a perpetuity. They assume that the appropriate
discount rate for the tax shield is the interest rate on debt, so the value of the tax
shield is
VTax shield ¼ rdDðTÞ
rd
¼ TD
Therefore, the value of a levered firm is
VL ¼ VU þ VTax shield
¼ VU þ TD
(26-4)
The important point here is that, when corporate taxes are introduced, the value of
the levered firm exceeds that of the unlevered firm by the amount TD. Since the
gain from leverage increases as debt increases, this implies that a firm’s value is maxi-
mized at 100% debt financing.
Because all cash flows are assumed to be perpetuities, the value of the unlevered
firm can be found by using Equation 26-3 and incorporating taxes. With zero debt
(D = $0), the value of the firm is its equity value:
VU ¼ S ¼ EBITð1 −TÞ
rsU
(26-5)
Note that the discount rate, rsU, is not necessarily equal to the discount rate in Equation
26-1. The rsU from Equation 26-1 is the required discount rate in a world with no taxes,
whereas the rsU in Equation 26-5 is the required discount rate in a world with taxes.
Proposition II.
The cost of equity to a levered firm is equal to (1) the cost of
equity to an unlevered firm in the same risk class plus (2) a risk premium whose size
depends on (a) the difference between the costs of equity and debt to an unlevered
firm, (b) the amount of financial leverage used, and (c) the corporate tax rate:
rsL ¼ rsU þ ðrsU −rdÞð1−TÞðD=SÞ
(26-6)
Observe that Equation 26-6 is identical to the corresponding without-tax equation
(26-2 except for the term (1 −T), which appears only in Equation 26-6. Because
(1 −T) is less than 1, corporate taxes cause the cost of equity to rise less rapidly
with leverage than it would in the absence of taxes. Proposition II, coupled with
the reduction (due to taxes) in the effective cost of debt, is what produces the
Proposition I result—namely, that the firm’s value increases as its leverage
increases.
As shown in Chapter 15, Professor Robert Hamada extended the MM analysis to
define the relationship between a firm’s beta, b, and the amount of leverage it has.
The beta of an unlevered firm is denoted by bU, and Hamada’s equation is
b ¼ bU½1 þ ð1 −TÞðD=SÞ
(26-7)
Note that beta, like the cost of stock shown in Equation 26-6, increases with
leverage.

Illustration of the MM Models
To illustrate the MM models, assume that the following data and conditions hold for
Fredrickson Water Company, an established firm that supplies water to residential
customers in several no-growth upstate New York communities.
1. Fredrickson currently has no debt; it is an all-equity company.
2. Expected EBIT = $2,400,000. This value is not expected to increase over time, so
Fredrickson is in a no-growth situation.
3. Because it does not need new capital, Fredrickson pays out all of its income as
dividends.
4. If Fredrickson begins to use debt, it can borrow at a rate rd = 8%. This borrow-
ing rate is constant—it does not increase regardless of the amount of debt used.
Any money raised by selling debt would be used to repurchase common stock, so
Fredrickson’s assets would remain constant.
5. The business risk inherent in Fredrickson’s assets, and thus in its EBIT, is such
that its beta is 0.80; this is called the unlevered beta, bU, because Fredrickson has
no debt. The risk-free rate is 8%, and the market risk premium (RPM) is 5%.
Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), Fredrickson’s required rate of
return on stock, rsU, is 12% if no debt is used:
rsU ¼ rRF þ bUðRPMÞ ¼ 8% þ 0:80ð5%Þ ¼ 12%
With Zero Taxes.
To begin, assume that there are no taxes and so T = 0%. At
any level of debt, Proposition I (Equation 26-1) can be used to find Fredrickson’s
value in an MM world, $20 million:
VL ¼ VU ¼ EBIT
rsU
¼ $2:4 million
0:12
¼ $20:0 million
If Fredrickson uses $10 million of debt, then the value of its stock must be $10 million:
S ¼ V −D ¼ $20 million −$10 million ¼ $10 million
We can also find Fredrickson’s cost of equity, rsL, and its WACC at a debt level of
$10 million. First, we use Proposition II (Equation 26-2) to find rsL, Fredrickson’s
levered cost of equity:
rsL ¼ rsU þ ðrsU −rdÞðD=SÞ
¼ 12% þ ð12% −8%Þð$10 million=$10 millionÞ
¼ 12% þ 4:0% ¼ 16:0%
Now we can find the company’s weighted average cost of capital:
WACC ¼ ðD=VÞðrdÞð1 −TÞ þ ðS=VÞrsL
¼ ð$10=$20Þð8%Þð1:0Þ þ ð$10=$20Þð16:0%Þ ¼ 12:0%
Fredrickson’s value and cost of capital based on the MM model without taxes at var-
ious debt levels are shown in Panel a on the left side of Figure 26-1. Here we see that,
in an MM world without taxes, financial leverage simply does not matter: The value of
the firm, and its overall cost of capital, are both independent of the amount of debt.
With Corporate Taxes.
To illustrate the MM model with corporate taxes, assume
that all of the previous conditions hold except for the following changes:

1. Expected EBIT = $4,000,000.4
2. Fredrickson has a 40% federal-plus-state tax rate, so T = 40%.

4If we had left Fredrickson’s EBIT at $2.4 million, then introducing corporate taxes would have reduced
the firm’s value from $20 million to $12 million:
VU ¼ EBITð1  TÞ
rsU
¼ $2:4 millionð0:6Þ
0:12
¼ $12:0 million
Corporate taxes reduce the amount of operating income available to investors in an unlevered firm by the
factor (1 −T), so the value of the firm would be reduced by the same amount, holding rsU constant.
1004
Part 10: Advanced Issues

Other things held constant, the introduction of corporate taxes would lower Fre-
drickson’s net income and hence its value, so we increased EBIT from $2.4 million
to $4 million to facilitate comparisons between the two models.
When Fredrickson has zero debt but pays taxes, Equation 26-5 can be used to find
its value:
VU ¼ EBITð1 −TÞ
rsU
¼ $4 millionð0:6Þ
0:12
¼ $20 million
If Fredrickson now uses $10 million of debt in a world with taxes, we see
by Proposition I (Equation 26-4) that its total market value rises from $20 to
$24 million:
VL ¼ VU þ TD ¼ $20 million þ 0:4ð$10 millionÞ ¼ $24 million
Therefore, the implied value of Fredrickson’s equity is $14 million:
S ¼ V −D ¼ $24 million −$10 million ¼ $14 million
We can also find Fredrickson’s cost of equity, rsL, and its WACC at a debt level of
$10 million. First, we use Proposition II (Equation 26-6) to find rsL, the levered cost
of equity:
rsL ¼ rsU þ ðrsU −rdÞð1 −TÞðD=SÞ
¼ 12% þ ð12% −8%Þð0:6Þð$10 million=$14 millionÞ
¼ 12% þ 1:71% ¼ 13:71%
The company’s weighted average cost of capital is then
WACC ¼ ðD=VÞðrdÞð1 −TÞ þ ðS=VÞrsL
¼ ð$10=$24Þð8%Þð0:6Þ þ ð$14=$24Þð13:71%Þ ¼ 10:0%
Note that we can also find the levered beta and then the levered cost of equity. First,
we apply Hamada’s equation to find the levered beta:
b ¼ bU½1 þ ð1 −TÞðD=SÞ
¼ 0:80½1 þ ð1 −0:4Þð$10 million=$14 millionÞ
¼ 1:1429
Applying the CAPM then yields the levered cost of equity as
rsL ¼ rRF þ bðRPMÞ ¼ 8% þ 1:1429ð5%Þ ¼ 0:1371 ¼ 13:71%
Observe that this is the same levered cost of equity that we obtained directly using
Equation 26-6.
Fredrickson’s value and cost of capital at various debt levels with corporate taxes
are shown in Panel b on the right side of Figure 26-1. In an MM world with corpo-
rate taxes, financial leverage does matter: The value of the firm is maximized—and its
overall cost of capital is minimized—if it uses almost 100% debt financing. The
Chapter 26: Analysis of Capital Structure Theory
1005

increase in value is due solely to the tax deductibility of interest payments, which
lowers both the cost of debt and the equity risk premium by (1 −T).5
To conclude this section, compare the “Without Taxes” and “With Corporate
Taxes” sections of Figure 26-1. Without taxes, both WACC and the firm’s value
(V) are constant. With corporate taxes, WACC declines and V rises as more and
more debt is used; thus, under MM with corporate taxes, the optimal capital structure
is 100% debt.
Self-Test
Is there an optimal capital structure under the MM zero-tax model?
What is the optimal capital structure under the MM model with corporate taxes?
How does the Proposition I equation differ between the two models?
How does the Proposition II equation differ between the two models?
Why do taxes result in a “gain from leverage” in the MM model with corporate
taxes?
An unlevered firm has a value of $100 million. An otherwise identical but levered
firm has $30 million in debt. Under the MM zero-tax model, what is the value of the
levered firm? ($100 million) Under the MM corporate tax model, what is the value of
a levered firm if the corporate tax rate is 40%? ($112 million)
26.2 INTRODUCING PERSONAL TAXES: THE MILLER
MODEL
Although MM included corporate taxes in the second version of their model, they did
not extend the model to include personal taxes. However, in his presidential address to
the American Finance Association, Merton Miller presented a model to show how
leverage affects firms’ values when both personal and corporate taxes are taken into
account.6 To explain Miller’s model, we begin by defining Tc as the corporate tax
rate, Ts as the personal tax rate on income from stocks, and Td as the personal tax
rate on income from debt. Note that stock returns are expected to come partly as
dividends and partly as capital gains, so Ts is a weighted average of the effective tax
rates on dividends and capital gains. However, essentially all debt income comes from
interest, which is effectively taxed at investors’ top rates; thus Td is higher than Ts.
5In the limit case where the firm used 100% debt financing, the bondholders would own the entire com-
pany and so would bear all the business risk. (Up until this point, MM assume that stockholders bear all
the risk.) If the bondholders bear all the risk, then the capitalization rate on the debt should be equal to
the equity capitalization rate at zero debt, rd = rsU = 12%.
The income stream to the stockholders in the all-equity case was $4,000,000(1 −T) = $2,400,000, and
the value of the firm was
VU ¼ $2;400;000
0:12
¼ $20;000;000
With all debt, the entire $4,000,000 of EBIT would be used to pay interest charges: rd would be 12%,
so I = 0.12(Debt) = $4,000,000. Taxes would be zero, so the investors (bondholders) would get the entire
$4,000,000 of operating income (they would not have to share it with the government). Thus, the value of
the firm at 100% debt would be
VL ¼ $4;000;000
0:12
¼ $33;333;333 ¼ D
There is, of course, a transition problem in all this. Modigliani and Miller assume that rd = 8% regardless
of how much debt the firm has until debt reaches 100%, at which point rd jumps to 12%, the cost of
equity. As we shall see later in the chapter, rd actually rises as the risk of financial distress increases.
6See Merton H. Miller, “Debt and Taxes,” Journal of Finance, May 1977, pp. 261–275.
1006
Part 10: Advanced Issues

With personal taxes included and under the same set of assumptions used in the
earlier MM models, the value of an unlevered firm is found as follows:
VU ¼ EBITð1 −TcÞ
rsU
¼ EBITð1 −TcÞð1 −TsÞ
rsUð1 −TsÞ
(26-8)
The (1 −Ts) term takes account of personal taxes. Note that, in order to find the
value of the unlevered firm, we can either discount pre-personal-tax cash flows at the
pre-personal-tax rate of rsU or discount after-personal-tax cash flows at the after-
personal-tax rate of rsU(1 −Ts). Therefore, the numerator in the second line of
Equation 26-8 shows how much of the firm’s operating income is left after the
unlevered firm pays corporate income taxes and its stockholders subsequently pay
personal taxes on their equity income. Note also that the discount rate, rsU, in Equa-
tion 26-8 is not necessarily equal to the discount rate in Equation 26-5. The rsU from
Equation 26-5 is the required discount rate in a world with corporate taxes but no
personal taxes; the rsU in Equation 26-8 is the required discount rate in a world
with both corporate and personal taxes.
Miller’s formula can be proved by an arbitrage proof similar to the one we pre-
sented earlier. However, the alternative proof shown below is easier to follow. To
begin, we partition the levered firm’s annual cash flows, CFL, into those going to
stockholders and those going to bondholders after corporate and personal taxes:
CFL ¼ Net CF to stockholders þ Net CF to bondholders
¼ ðEBIT −IÞð1 −TcÞð1 −TsÞ þ Ið1 −TdÞ
(26-9)
where I is the annual interest payment. Equation 26-9 can be rearranged as follows:
CFL ¼ ½EBITð1 −TcÞð1 −TsÞ −½Ið1 −TcÞð1 −TsÞ þ ½Ið1 −TdÞ
(26-9a)
The first term in Equation 26-9a is identical to the after-personal-tax cash flow of an
unlevered firm as shown in the numerator of Equation 26-8, and its present value is
found by discounting the perpetual cash flow by rsU(1 −Ts).
The second and third terms reflect leverage and result from the cash flows associ-
ated with debt financing, which under the MM assumptions are riskless (because the
firm’s debt is riskless under those assumptions). We can either discount pre-
personal-tax interest payments at the pre-personal-tax rate of rd or discount after-
personal-tax interest payments at the after-personal-tax rate of rd(1 −Td). Because
they are after-personal-tax cash flows to debtholders, the present value of the last two
right-hand terms in Equation 26-9a can be obtained by discounting at the after-
personal-tax cost of debt, rd(1 −Td). Combining the present values of the three
terms, we obtain this value for the levered firm:
VL ¼ EBITð1 −TcÞð1 −TsÞ
rsUð1 −TsÞ
−Ið1 −TcÞð1 −TsÞ
rdð1 −TdÞ
þ Ið1 −TdÞ
rdð1 −TdÞ
(26-10)
Chapter 26: Analysis of Capital Structure Theory
1007

The first right-hand term in Equation 26-10 is identical to VU in Equation 26-8.
Recognizing this and consolidating the second two terms, we obtain
VL ¼ VU þ 1 −ð1 −TcÞð1 −TsÞ
ð1 −TdÞ

 Ið1 −TdÞ
rdð1 −TdÞ


(26-10a)
Now recognize that the after-tax perpetual interest payment divided by the after-tax
required rate of return on debt, I(1 −Td)/rd(1 −Td), is equal to the market value of
the perpetual debt, D:
D ¼ I
rd
¼ Ið1 −TdÞ
rdð1 −TdÞ
(26-11)
Substituting D into Equation 26-10a and rearranging, we obtain the following
expression, which is called the Miller model:
Miller model: VL ¼ VU þ 1 −ð1 −TcÞð1 −TsÞ
ð1 −TdÞ


D
(26-12)
The Miller model provides an estimate of the value of a levered firm in a world with
both corporate and personal taxes.
The Miller model has several important implications, as follows.
1. The term in brackets,
1 −ð1 −TcÞð1 −TsÞ
ð1 −TdÞ


when multiplied by D, represents the gain from leverage. The bracketed term
thus replaces the corporate tax rate, T, in the earlier MM model with corporate
taxes (VL = VU + TD).
2. If we ignore all taxes (i.e., if Tc = Ts = Td = 0) then the bracketed term is zero, so
in this case Equation 26-12 is the same as the original MM model without taxes.
3. If we ignore personal taxes (i.e., if Ts = Td = 0) then the bracketed term reduces
to [1 −(1 −Tc)] = Tc, so in this case Equation 26-12 is the same as the MM
model with corporate taxes.
4. If the effective personal tax rates on stock and bond incomes were equal (i.e., if
Ts = Td), then (1 −Ts) and (1 −Td) would cancel and so the bracketed term
would again reduce to Tc.
5. If (1 −Tc)(1 −Ts) = (1 −Td), then the bracketed term would be zero and so the
value of using leverage would also be zero. This implies that the tax advantage of
debt to the firm would be exactly offset by the personal tax advantage of equity.
Under this condition, capital structure would have no effect on a firm’s value or
its cost of capital, so we would be back to MM’s original zero-tax proposition.
6. Because taxes on capital gains are lower than on ordinary income and can be
deferred, the effective tax rate on stock income is normally less than that on bond
income. This being the case, what would the Miller model predict as the gain
from leverage? To answer this question, assume the tax rate on corporate income
is Tc = 34%, the effective rate on bond income is Td = 28%, and the effective
rate on stock income is Ts = 15%. Using these values in the Miller model, we
1008

Note that the MM model with corporate taxes would indicate a gain from leverage
of Tc(D) = 0.34D, or 34% of the amount of corporate debt. Thus, with these
assumed tax rates, adding personal taxes to the model lowers but does not eliminate
the benefit from corporate debt. In general, whenever the effective tax rate on
income from stock is less than the effective rate on income from bonds, the Miller
model produces a lower gain from leverage than is produced by the MM model with
taxes.
In his paper, Miller argued that firms in the aggregate would issue a mix of debt
and equity securities such that the before-tax yields on corporate securities and the
personal tax rates of the investors who bought these securities would adjust until an
equilibrium was reached. At equilibrium, (1 −Td) would equal (1 −Tc)(1 −Ts) and
so, as we noted in item 5 above, the tax advantage of debt to the firm would be
exactly offset by personal taxation and thus capital structure would have no effect
on a firm’s value or its cost of capital. Hence, according to Miller, the conclusions
derived from the original MM zero-tax model are correct!
Others have extended and tested Miller’s analysis. Generally, these extensions
question Miller’s conclusion that there is no advantage to the use of corporate debt.
In fact, Equation 26-12 shows that both Tc and Ts must be less than Td if there is to
be zero gain from leverage. For most U.S. corporations and investors, the effective
tax rate on income from stock is less than the rate on income from bonds; that is,
Ts < Td. However, many corporate bonds are held by tax-exempt institutions,
and in those cases Tc is generally greater than Td. Also, for those high–tax-bracket
individuals with Td > Tc, Ts may be large enough that (1 −Tc)(1 −Ts) is less than
(1 −Td); in this case there would be an advantage to using corporate debt. Still, Mill-
er’s work does show that personal taxes offset some of the benefits of corporate debt.
This means that the tax advantages of corporate debt are less than were implied by
the earlier MM model, where only corporate taxes were considered.
As we discuss in the next section, both the MM and the Miller models are based
on strong and unrealistic assumptions, so we should regard our examples as indicat-
ing the general effects of leverage on a firm’s value and not a precise relationship.
Self-Test
How does the Miller model differ from the MM model with corporate taxes?
What are the implications of the Miller model if Tc = Ts = Td = 0? If Ts = Td = 0?
Considering the current tax structure in the United States, what is the primary impli-
cation of the Miller model?
An unlevered firm has a value of $100 million. An otherwise identical but levered
firm has $30 million in debt. Use the Miller model to calculate the value of a levered
firm if the corporate tax rate is 40%, the personal tax rate on equity is 15%, and the
personal tax rate on debt is 35%. ($106.46 million)

26.3 CRITICISMS OF THE MM AND MILLER MODELS
The conclusions of the MM and Miller models follow logically from their initial
assumptions. However, both academicians and executives have voiced concerns over
the validity of the MM and Miller models, and virtually no one believes they hold
precisely. The MM zero-tax model leads to the conclusion that capital structure
doesn’t matter, yet we observe systematic capital structure patterns within industries.
Further, when used with “reasonable” tax rates, both the MM model with corporate
taxes and the Miller model lead to the conclusion that firms should use 100% debt
financing, but real-life firms do not (deliberately) go to that extreme.
People who disagree with the MM and Miller theories generally attack them on
the grounds that their assumptions are invalid. Here are the main objections.
1. Both MM and Miller assume that personal and corporate leverage are perfect sub-
stitutes. However, an individual investing in a levered firm has less loss exposure as a
result of corporate limited liability than if she used “homemade” leverage. For exam-
ple, in our earlier illustration of the MM arbitrage argument, it should be noted that
only the $600,000 our investor had in Firm L would be lost if that firm went bank-
rupt. However, if the investor engaged in arbitrage transactions and employed
“homemade” leverage to invest in Firm U, then she could lose $900,000—the orig-
inal $600,000 investment plus the $400,000 loan less the $100,000 investment in
riskless bonds. This increased personal risk exposure would tend to restrain investors
from engaging in arbitrage, and that could cause the equilibrium values of VL, VU,
rsL, and rsU to be different from those specified by MM. Restrictions on institutional
investors, who dominate capital markets today, may also hinder the arbitrage pro-
cess, because many institutional investors cannot legally borrow to buy stocks and
hence are prohibited from engaging in homemade leverage.
However, even though limited liability may present a problem to individuals, it
does not present a problem to corporations that are set up to undertake leveraged
buyouts (LBOs). Thus, after MM’s work became widely known, literally hundreds
of LBO firms were established whose founders made billions by recapitalizing un-
derleveraged firms. “Junk bonds” were created to aid in the process, and the man-
agers of underleveraged firms who did not want their firms to be taken over
increased debt usage on their own. Thus, MM’s work raised the level of debt in
corporate America, which probably raised the level of economic efficiency.
2. If a levered firm’s operating income declined, then it would sell assets and take
other measures to raise the cash necessary to meet its interest obligations and
thus avoid bankruptcy. If our illustrative unlevered firm experienced the same
decline in operating income, it would probably take the less drastic measure of
cutting dividends rather than selling assets. But if dividends were cut then inves-
tors who employed homemade leverage would not receive cash to pay the interest
on their debt. Thus, homemade leverage puts stockholders in greater danger of
bankruptcy than does corporate leverage.
3. Brokerage costs were assumed away by MM and Miller, which makes the switch
from L to U costless. However, brokerage and other transaction costs do exist,
and they also impede the arbitrage process.
4. Modigliani and Miller initially assumed that corporations and investors could
borrow at the risk-free rate. Although risky debt has been introduced into the
analysis by others, to reach the MM and Miller conclusions it is still necessary to
assume that both corporations and investors can borrow at the same rate.
Although major institutional investors probably can borrow at the corporate rate,
1010
Part 10: Advanced Issues

many institutions are not allowed to borrow to buy securities. Furthermore, most
individual investors must borrow at higher rates than those paid by large
corporations.
5. In his article, Miller concluded that an equilibrium would be reached, but to reach
his equilibrium the tax benefit from corporate debt must be the same for all firms
and must also be constant for an individual firm regardless of the amount of leverage
used. However, we know that tax benefits vary from firm to firm: Highly profitable
companies gain the maximum tax benefit from leverage, whereas the benefits to
firms that are struggling are much smaller. Moreover, some firms have other tax
shields (e.g., high depreciation, pension plan contributions, operating loss carryfor-
wards), and these shields reduce the tax savings from interest payments.7 It also is
simplistic to assume that the expected tax shield is unaffected by the amount of debt
used. Higher leverage increases the probability that the firm will not be able to use
the full tax shield in the future, because higher leverage increases the probability of
future unprofitability and consequently lower tax rates. Note also that large, diversi-
fied corporations can use losses in one division to offset profits in another. Thus, the
tax shelter benefit is more certain in such firms than in smaller, single-product
companies. All things considered, it appears likely that the interest tax shield from
corporate debt is more valuable to some firms than to others.
6. MM and Miller assume that there are no costs associated with financial distress,
and they also ignore agency costs. Further, they assume that all market partici-
pants have identical information about firms’ prospects, which is clearly an
oversimplification.
These six points all suggest that the MM and Miller models lead to questionable con-
clusions and that the models would be better if certain of their assumptions could be
relaxed. We discuss an extension of the models in the next section.

26.4 AN EXTENSION OF THE MM MODEL: NONZERO
GROWTH AND A RISKY TAX SHIELD
In this section, we discuss an extension of the MM model that incorporates growth
and different discount rates for the debt tax shield.8
Modigliani and Miller assumed that firms pay out all of their earnings as dividends
and therefore do not grow. However, most firms do grow, and growth affects the
MM and Hamada results (as found in the first part of this chapter). Recall that, for

Capital Structure under Corporate and Personal Taxation,” Journal of Financial Economics, March 1980,

Out,” The Financial Review, November 1993, pp. 549–583; John R. Graham, “Taxes and Corporate

an unlevered firm, the WACC is just the unlevered cost of equity: WACC = rsU. If g
is the constant growth rate and FCF is the expected free cash flow, then the corpo-
rate value model from Chapter 13 shows that
VU ¼
FCF
rsU −g
(26-13)
As shown by Equation 26-4, the value of the levered firm is equal to the value of the
unlevered firm plus gain from leverage, which is the value of the tax shield:
VL ¼ VU þ VTax shield
(26-4a)
However, when there is growth, the value of the tax shield is not equal to TD as it is
in the MM model with corporate taxes. If the firm uses debt and if g is positive then,
as the firm grows, the amount of debt will increase over time; hence the size of the
annual tax shield will also increase at the rate g, provided the debt ratio remains con-
stant. Moreover, the value of this growing tax shield is greater than the value of the
constant tax shield in the MM analysis.
Modigliani and Miller assumed that corporate debt was riskless and that the firm
would always be able to use its tax savings. Therefore, they discounted the tax savings
at the cost of debt, rd, which is the risk-free rate. However, corporate debt is not risk
free—firms do occasionally default on their loans. Also, a firm may not be able to use
tax savings from debt in the current year if it already has a pre-tax loss from operations.
Therefore, the flow of tax savings to the firm is not risk-free and hence it should be dis-
counted at a higher rate than the risk-free rate. In addition, since debt is safer than
equity to an investor because it has a higher priority claim on the firm’s cash flows, its
discount rate should be no greater than the unlevered cost of equity. For now, assume
that the appropriate discount rate for the tax savings is rTS, which is greater than or equal
to the cost of debt, rd, and less than or equal to the unlevered cost of equity, rsU.
If rTS is the appropriate discount rate for the tax shield, rd is the interest rate on
the debt, T is the corporate tax rate, and D is the current amount of debt, then the
present value of this growing tax shield is
VTax shield ¼ rdTD
rTS −g
(26-14)
This formula is similar to the dividend growth formula from Chapter 7, except it has
rdTD as the growing cash flow generated by the tax savings and rTS as the discount
rate. Substituting Equation 26-14 into Equation 26-4a yields a valuation expression
that incorporates constant growth:
VL ¼ VU þ
rd
rTS −g


TD
(26-15)
The difference between Equation 26-15 for the value of the levered firm and the ex-
pression given in Equation 26-4 is the rd/(rTS −g) term in large parentheses, which
reflects the added value of the tax shield due to growth. In the MM model, rTS = rd =
rRF and g = 0, so the term in parentheses is equal to 1.0.
1012
Part 10: Advanced Issues

If rTS < rsU, then growth can actually cause the levered cost of equity to be less than
the unlevered cost of equity.9 This happens because the combination of rapid growth
and a low discount rate for the tax shield causes the value of the tax shield to dominate
the unlevered value of the firm. If this were true, then high-growth firms would tend to
have larger amounts of debt than low-growth firms. However, this is not consistent with
either intuition or what we observe in the market: High-growth firms actually tend to
have lower levels of debt. Regardless of the growth rate, firms with more debt should
have a higher cost of equity than firms with no debt. These inconsistencies can be
resolved if rTS = rsU. Given this equality, the value of the levered firm becomes10
VL ¼ VU þ
rdTD
rsU −g


(26-16)
In view of this valuation equation, expressions for the levered cost of equity and
the levered beta (corresponding to Equations 26-6 and 26-7) become
rsL ¼ rsU þ ðrsU −rdÞ D
S
(26-17)
and
b ¼ bU þ ðbU −bDÞ D
S
(26-18)
As in Chapter 15, bU is the beta of an unlevered firm and b is the beta of a levered
firm. Because debt is not riskless, it has a beta (bD).
Although the derivations of Equations 26-17 and 26-18 reflect corporate taxes and
growth, neither of these expressions includes the corporate tax rate or the growth
rate. This means that the expression for the levered required rate of return, Equation
26-17, is exactly the same as MM’s expression for the levered required rate of
return without taxes, Equation 26-2. And the expression for the levered beta, Equa-
tion 26-18, is exactly the same as Hamada’s equation (with risky debt) but without
taxes. The reason the tax rate and the growth rate drop out of these two expressions
is that the growing tax shield is discounted at the unlevered cost of equity, rsU, not at
the cost of debt as in the MM model. The tax rate drops out because, no matter how
high the level of T, the total risk of the firm will not be changed: the unlevered cash
flows and the tax shield are discounted at the same rate. The growth rate drops out
for the same reason: An increasing debt level will not change the riskiness of the
entire firm no matter what rate of growth prevails.11
9See the paper by Ehrhardt and Daves cited in footnote 8.
10For a discussion of the compressed APV valuation method, which assumes that rTS = rsU, see Steven
N. Kaplan and Richard S. Ruback, “The Valuation of Cash Flow Forecasts: An Empirical Analysis,”
Journal of Finance, September 1995, pp. 1059–1093.
11Of course, Equations 26-14, 26-15, and 26-16 also apply to firms that don’t happen to be growing. In
this special case, the difference between the Ehrhardt and Daves extension and the MM with taxes treat-
ment is that MM assume that the tax shield should be discounted at the risk-free rate, whereas this exten-
sion of their model shows it is more reasonable for the tax shield to be discounted at the unlevered cost of
equity, rsU. Because rsU is greater than the risk-free rate, the value of a nongrowing tax shield will be
lower when discounted at this higher rate, giving a lower value of the levered firm than what MM would
predict.
Chapter 26: Analysis of Capital Structure Theory
1013

Observe that Equation 26-18 includes the term bD. Since MM and Hamada
assumed that corporate debt is riskless, its beta should be zero. However, if corporate
debt is not riskless then its beta, bD, may not be zero. If we assume that bonds lie on
the Security Market Line, then a bond’s required return, rd, can be expressed as rd =
rRF + bDRPM. Solving for bD then gives bD = (rd −rRF)/RPM.
Illustration of the MM Extension with Growth
Earlier in this chapter we examined Fredrickson Water Company, a zero-growth
firm with unlevered value of $20 million. To see how growth affects the levered
value of the firm and the levered cost of equity, let’s look at Peterson Power Inc.,
which is similar to Fredrickson except that it is growing. Peterson’s expected
free cash flow is $1 million, which is expected to grow at a rate of 7%. Like Fre-
drickson, Peterson has an unlevered cost of equity of 12% and faces a 40% tax
rate. Peterson’s unlevered value is VU = $1 million/(0.12 −0.07) = $20 million, the
same as Fredrickson’s.
Suppose now that Peterson, like Fredrickson, uses $10 million of debt with a cost
of 8%. We see from Equation 26-16 that
VL ¼ $20 million þ
0:08 × 0:40 × $10 million
0:12 −0:07


¼ $26:4 million
and that the implied value of equity is
S ¼ VL −D ¼ $26:4 million −$10 million ¼ $16:4 million
The increase in value due to leverage when there is 7% growth is $6.4 million, com-
pared with the increase in value of only $4 million for Fredrickson. The reason
for this difference is that, even though the debt tax shield is currently (0.08)(0.40)
(10 million) = $0.32 million for each company, this tax shield will grow at an annual
rate of 7% for Peterson but will remain fixed over time for Fredrickson. And even
though Peterson and Fredrickson have the same initial dollar value of debt, their debt
weights, wd, are not the same. Peterson’s wd is D/VL = $10/$26.4 = 37.88%, whereas
Fredrickson’s wd is $10/$24 = 41.67%.
With $10 million in debt, Peterson’s new cost of equity is given by Equation 26-17:
rsL ¼ 12% þ ð12% −8%Þ 0:3788
0:6212 ¼ 14:44%
This is higher than Fredrickson’s levered cost of equity of 13.71%. Finally, Peterson’s new
WACC is (1.0 −0.3788)14.44% + 0.3788(1 −0.40)8% = 10.78% versus Fredrickson’s
WACC of 10.0%.
In sum, using the MM and Hamada models to calculate the value of a levered firm
and its cost of capital when there is growth will: (1) underestimate the value of the
levered firm, because these models underestimate the value of the growing tax shield;
and (2) underestimate the levered WACC and levered cost of capital because, for a
given initial amount of debt, these models overestimate the firm’s wd.

Why is the value of the tax shield different when a firm grows?
Why would it be inappropriate to discount tax shield cash flows at the risk-free rate
as MM do?
How will your estimates of the levered cost of equity be biased if you use the MM or
Hamada models when growth is present? Why does this matter?

Part 10: Advanced Issues

An unlevered firm has a value of $100 million. An otherwise identical but levered
firm has $30 million in debt. Suppose both firms are growing at a constant rate of
5%, the corporate tax rate is 40%, the cost of debt is 6%, and the unlevered cost of
equity is 8% (assume rsU is the appropriate discount rate for the tax shield). What
is the value of the levered firm? ($124 million) What is the value of the stock?
($94 million) What is the levered cost of equity? (8.64%)
26.5 RISKY DEBT AND EQUITY AS AN OPTION
In the previous sections, we evaluated equity and debt using the standard discounted
cash flow techniques. However, we learned in Chapter 11 that if there is an opportu-
nity for management to make a change as a result of new information after a project
or investment has been started, then there might be an option component to the
project or investment being evaluated. This is the case with equity. To see why, con-
sider Kunkel Inc., a small manufacturer of electronic wiring harnesses and instru-
mentation located in Minot, North Dakota. Kunkel’s current value (debt plus
equity) is $20 million, and its debt consists of $10 million face value of 5-year zero
coupon bonds. What decision does management make when the debt comes due?
In most cases, it would pay the $10 million that is due. But what if the company has
done poorly and the firm is worth only $9 million? In that case, the firm is techni-
cally bankrupt, since its value is less than the amount of debt due. Management
will choose to default on the loan; in this case, the firm will be liquidated or sold
for $9 million, the debtholders will get all $9 million, and the stockholders will get
nothing. Of course, if the firm is worth $10 million or more then management will
choose to repay the loan. The ability to make this decision—to pay or not to pay—
looks very much like an option, and the techniques we developed in Chapter 8 can be
used to value it.
Using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to
Value Equity
To put this decision into an option context, suppose P is Kunkel’s total value when
the debt matures. Then, if the debt is paid off, Kunkel’s stockholders will receive
the equivalent of P −$10 million if P > $10 million.12 They will receive nothing if
P ≤$10 million because management will default on the bond. These facts can be
summarized as follows:
Payoff to stockholders ¼ MAXðP −$10 million;0Þ
(26-18)
This is exactly the same payoff as a European call option on the total value (P) of the
firm with a strike price equal to the face value of the debt, $10 million. We can use
the Black-Scholes option pricing model from Chapter 8 to determine the value of
this asset.
Recall from Chapter 8 that the value of a call option depends on five things: the
price of the underlying asset, the strike price, the risk-free rate, the time to expira-
tion, and the volatility of the market value of the underlying asset. Here the underly-
ing asset is the total value of the firm. If we assume that volatility is 40% and that the
risk-free rate is 6%, then the inputs for the Black-Scholes model are as follows:
12Actually, rather than receive cash of P −$10 million, the stockholders will keep the company (which is
worth P −$10 million) rather than turn it over to the bondholders.

N(0.6632) = 0.7464, and V = $20(0.9403) −$10e−0.06(5)(0.7464) = $13.28 million. So
Kunkel’s equity is worth $13.28 million, and its debt must be worth what is left over:
$20 −$13.28 = $6.72 million. Since this is 5-year, zero coupon debt, its yield must be
Yield on debt ¼

1=5
−1 ¼ 0:0827 ¼ 8:27%
(26-21)
Thus, when Kunkel issued the debt, it received $6.72 million and the yield on the
debt was 8.27%. Notice that the yield on the debt, 8.27%, is greater than the 6%
risk-free rate. This is because the firm might default if its value falls enough, so the
bonds are risky. Note also that the yield on the debt depends on the value of the
option and hence on the riskiness of the firm. The debt will have a lower value—
and a higher yield—the more the option is worth.
Managerial Incentives
The only decision an investor in a stock option can make, once the option is pur-
chased, is whether and when to exercise it. However, this restriction does not apply
to equity when it is viewed as an option on the total value of the firm. Management
has some leeway to affect the riskiness of the firm through its capital budgeting and
investment decisions, and it can affect the amount of capital invested in the firm
through its dividend policy.
1016
Part 10: Advanced Issues

Capital Budgeting Decisions
When Kunkel issued the $10 million face value debt discussed previously, the yield
was determined in part by Kunkel’s riskiness, which in turn was determined in part
by what management intended to do with the $6.72 million it raised. We know from
our analysis in Chapter 8 that options are worth more when volatility is higher. This
means that if Kunkel’s management can find a way to increase its riskiness without
decreasing the total value of the firm, then doing so will increase the equity’s value
while decreasing the debt’s value. Management can accomplish this by selecting risky
rather than safe investment projects. Table 26-1 shows the value of equity, the value
of debt, and the yield on debt for a range of possible volatilities. See Ch26 Tool
Kit.xls for the calculations.
Kunkel’s current volatility is 40%, so its equity is worth $13.28 million and its
debt is worth $6.72 million. But if, after incurring the debt, management undertakes
projects that increase its riskiness from a volatility of 40% to a volatility of 80%, then
the value of Kunkel’s equity will increase by $2.53 million to $15.81 million and the
value of its debt will decrease by the same amount. This 19% increase in the value of
the equity represents a transfer of wealth from bondholders to stockholders. A corre-
sponding transfer of wealth from stockholders to bondholders would occur if Kunkel
undertook projects that were safer than originally planned. Table 26-1 shows that if
management undertakes safe projects and drives the volatility down to 30%, then
stockholders will lose (and bondholders will gain) $0.45 million.
Such a strategy of investing borrowed funds in risky assets is called bait and
switch because the firm obtains the money by promising one investment policy and
then switching to another policy. The bait-and-switch problem is more severe when
a firm’s value is low relative to its level of debt. If Kunkel’s total value is $20 million,
then doubling its volatility from 40% to 80% increases its equity value by 19%. But
if Kunkel had done poorly in recent years and its total value were only $10 million,
then the impact of increasing volatility would be much greater. Table 26-2 shows
that if Kunkel’s total value were only $10 million and it issued $10 million face value
of 5-year, zero coupon debt, then its equity would be worth $4.46 million at a vola-
tility of 40%. Doubling the volatility to 80% would increase the value of the equity
to $6.83 million, or by 53%. The incentive for management to “roll the dice” with

borrowed funds can be enormous, and if management owns many stock options then
their payoff from rolling the dice is even greater than the payoff to stockholders!
Bondholders are aware of these incentives and write covenants into debt issues
that restrict management’s ability to invest in riskier projects than originally prom-
ised. However, their attempts to protect themselves are not always successful, as the
failures of Enron and Global Crossing demonstrate. The combination of a risky
industry, high levels of debt, and option-based compensation has proven to be very
dangerous.
Equity with Risky Coupon Debt
We have analyzed the simple case when a firm has zero coupon debt outstanding.
The analysis becomes much more complicated when a firm has debt that requires
periodic interest payments, because then management can decide whether or not to
default on each interest payment date. For example, suppose Kunkel’s $10 million of
debt is a 1-year, 8% loan with semiannual payments. The scheduled payments are
$400,000 in 6 months, and then $10.4 million at the end of the year. If management
makes the scheduled $400,000 interest payment, then the stockholders will acquire the
right to make the next payment of $10.4 million. If it does not make the $400,000 pay-
ment, then by defaulting the stockholders lose the right to make that next payment and
hence lose the firm.13 In other words, at the beginning of the year the stockholders have
an option to purchase an option. The option they own has an exercise price of $400,000
and it expires in 6 months, and if they exercise it, they will acquire an option to purchase
the entire firm for $10.4 million in another 6 months.
If the debt were 2-year debt, then there would be four decision points for manage-
ment and the stockholders’ position would be like an option on an option on an
option on an option! These types of options are called compound options,
and techniques for valuing them are beyond the scope of this book. However, the

13Actually, bankruptcy is far more complicated than our example suggests. As a firm approaches default it
can take a number of actions, and even after filing for bankruptcy the stockholders can substantially delay
a takeover by bondholders, during which time the value of the firm can deteriorate further. As a result,
stockholders can often extract concessions from bondholders in situations where it would seem that the
bondholders should get all of the firm’s value. Bankruptcy is discussed in more detail in Chapter 22.

26.6 CAPITAL STRUCTURE THEORY: OUR VIEW
The great contribution of the capital structure models developed by MM, Miller, and
their followers is that these models identified the specific benefits and costs of using
debt: the tax benefits, financial distress costs, and so on. Prior to MM, no capital
structure theory existed and so we had no systematic way of analyzing the effects of
debt financing.
The trade-off model discussed in Chapter 15 is summarized graphically in Figure 26-2.
The top graph shows the relationships between the debt ratio and the cost of debt,
the cost of equity, and the WACC. Both rs and rd(1 −Tc) rise steadily with increases in
leverage, but the rate of increase accelerates at higher debt levels; this reflects agency costs
and the increased probability of financial distress. Under increasing leverage the WACC
first declines, then hits a minimum at D/V*, and then begins to rise. Note that the value of
D in D/V* in the upper graph is D*, the level of debt in the lower graph that maximizes
the firm’s value. Thus, a firm’s WACC is minimized and its value is maximized at the
same capital structure. Note also that the general shapes of the curves apply regardless of
whether we are using the modified MM with corporate taxes model, the Miller model, or
a variant of these models.
Unfortunately, it is impossible to quantify accurately the costs and benefits of debt
financing, so it is impossible to pinpoint D/V*, the capital structure that maximizes a
firm’s value. Most experts believe that such a structure exists for every firm but that
it changes over time as a firm’s operations and investor preferences change. Most
experts also believe that, as shown in Figure 26-2, the relationship between value
and leverage is relatively flat over a fairly broad range, so large deviations from the
optimal capital structure can occur without materially affecting the stock price.
Now consider signaling theory, which we discussed in Chapter 15. Because of
asymmetric information, investors know less about a firm’s prospects than its man-
agers know. Furthermore, managers try to maximize value for current stockholders,
not new ones. Hence, if the firm has excellent prospects then management will not
want to issue new shares, but if things look bleak then a new stock offering would
benefit current stockholders. Investors therefore view a stock offering as a signal of
bad news, so stock prices tend to decline when new issues are announced. As a result,
new equity financings are relatively expensive. The net effect of signaling is to moti-
vate firms to maintain a reserve borrowing capacity so that future investment oppor-
tunities can be financed by debt if internal funds are not available.
By combining the trade-off and asymmetric information theories, we obtain the
following explanation for firms’ behavior.

1. Debt financing provides benefits because of the tax deductibility of interest, so firms
should have some debt in their capital structures.
2. However, financial distress and agency costs place limits on debt usage—beyond
some point, these costs offset the tax advantage of debt. The costs of financial
distress are especially harmful to firms whose values consist primarily of intangible

growth options, such as research and development. Such firms should have lower
levels of debt than firms whose asset bases consist mostly of tangible assets.
3. Because of problems resulting from asymmetric information and flotation costs,
low-growth firms should follow a pecking order by raising capital first from internal
sources, then by borrowing, and finally by issuing new stock. In fact, such low-
growth firms rarely need to issue external equity. High-growth firms whose growth
occurs primarily through increases in tangible assets should follow the same pecking
order, but usually they will need to issue new stock as well as debt. High-growth
firms whose values consist primarily of intangible growth options may run out of
internally generated cash, but they should emphasize stock rather than debt because
of the severe problems that financial distress imposes on such firms.
4. Managers have better information than investors about a firm’s prospects. This
informational asymmetry causes investors to view a stock issue as a negative sig-
nal, which leads to a decline in stock price. To prevent this, firms should main-
tain a reserve of borrowing capacity so they can take advantage of investment
opportunities without having to issue stock at low prices. This reserve will cause
the actual debt ratio to be lower than that suggested by the trade-off models.
There is some evidence that managers do attempt to behave in ways that are con-
sistent with this view of capital structure. In a survey of CFOs, about two-thirds said
they follow a “hierarchy in which the most advantageous sources of funds are
exhausted before other sources are used.” The hierarchy usually followed the pecking
order of first internally generated cash flow, then debt, and finally external equity,
which is consistent with the predicted behavior of most low-growth firms. But there
were occasions in which external equity was the first source of financing, which
would be consistent with the theory for either high-growth firms or firms whose
agency costs and level of financial distress have exceeded the benefit of tax savings.15

Summary
In this chapter we discussed a variety of topics related to capital structure decisions.
The key concepts covered are listed below.
•
In 1958, Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller (MM) proved, under a restrictive
set of assumptions including zero taxes, that capital structure is irrelevant; thus,
according to the original MM article, a firm’s value is not affected by its financing mix.
•
Modigliani and Miller later added corporate taxes to their model and reached
the conclusion that capital structure does matter. Indeed, their model led to the
conclusion that firms should use 100% debt financing.
•
MM’s model with corporate taxes demonstrated that the primary benefit of debt
stems from the tax deductibility of interest payments.
15For more on capital budgeting issues, see Ravindra R. Kamath, “Long-Term Financing Decisions:
Views and Practices of Financial Managers of NYSE Firms,” The Financial Review, May 1997, pp. 350–
356; Michael T. Dugan and Keith A. Shriver, “An Empirical Comparison of Alternative Methods for
Estimating the Degree of Operating Leverage,” The Financial Review, May 1992, pp. 309–321; and Dilip
K. Ghosh, “Optimum Capital Structure Redefined,” The Financial Review, August 1992, pp. 411–429.
Chapter 26: Analysis of Capital Structure Theory

•
Later, Miller extended the theory to include personal taxes. The introduction of
personal taxes reduces, but does not eliminate, the benefits of debt financing.
Thus, the Miller model also leads to 100% debt financing.
•
The introduction of growth changes the MM and Hamada results for the levered
cost of equity and the levered beta.
•
If the firm is growing at a constant rate, the debt tax shield is discounted at rsU,
and debt remains a constant proportion of the capital structure, then
rsL ¼ rsU þ ðrsU −rdÞ D
S
and
b ¼ bU þ ðbU −bDÞ D
S
•
When debt is risky, management may choose to default. If the debt is zero
coupon debt, then this makes equity like an option on the value of the firm
with a strike price equal to the face value of the debt. If the debt has periodic
interest payments then the equity is like an option on an option, or a compound
option.
•
When a firm has risky debt and equity is like an option, management has an
incentive to increase the firm’s risk in order to increase the equity value at the
expense of the debt value. This is called bait and switch.

A utility company is allowed to charge prices high enough to cover all costs,
including its cost of capital. Public service commissions are supposed to take
actions that stimulate companies to operate as efficiently as possible in order to
keep costs, and hence prices, as low as possible. Some time ago, AT&T’s debt
ratio was about 33%. Some individuals (Myron J. Gordon, in particular) argued
that a higher debt ratio would lower AT&T’s cost of capital and permit it to
charge lower rates for telephone service. Gordon thought an optimal debt ratio
for AT&T was about 50%. Do the theories presented in the chapter support or
refute Gordon’s position?

V = S = $12 million. Management is considering the use of some debt financing.
(Debt would be issued and used to buy back stock, so the size of the firm would re-

would tend to increase as debt is added to the capital structure, but there would be
an offset in the form of a rising risk of financial distress. The firm’s analysts have
estimated, as an approximation, that the present value of any future financial distress
costs is $8 million and that the probability of distress would increase with leverage

Business and Financial
Risk—MM Model
Air Tampa has just been incorporated, and its board of directors is currently grap-
pling with the question of optimal capital structure. The company plans to offer
commuter air services between Tampa and smaller surrounding cities. Jaxair has
been around for a few years, and it has about the same basic business risk as Air
Tampa would have. Jaxair’s market-determined beta is 1.8, and it has a current mar-
ket value debt ratio (total debt to total assets) of 50% and a federal-plus-state tax rate
of 40%. Air Tampa expects to be only marginally profitable at start-up; hence its
tax rate would only be 25%. Air Tampa’s owners expect that the total book and mar-
ket value of the firm’s stock, if it uses zero debt, would be $10 million. Air Tampa’s
CFO believes that the MM and Hamada formulas for the value of a levered firm and
the levered firm’s cost of capital should be used. (These are given in Equations 26-4,
26-6, and 26-7.)
a. Estimate the beta of an unlevered firm in the commuter airline business based on
Jaxair’s market-determined beta. (Hint: This is a levered beta; use Equation 26-7
and solve for bU.)
b. Now assume that rd = rRF = 10% and that the market risk premium RPM = 5%.
Find the required rate of return on equity for an unlevered commuter airline.
c. Air Tampa is considering three capital structures: (1) $2 million debt,
(2) $4 million debt, and (3) $6 million debt. Estimate Air Tampa’s rs for these
debt levels.
d. Calculate Air Tampa’s rs at $6 million debt while assuming its federal-plus-state
tax rate is now 40%. Compare this with your corresponding answer to part c.

foreign governments, IA will not pay any taxes; that is, its tax rate will be zero. Manage-
ment is trying to decide how to raise the required $10 million. It is known that the
capitalization rate rU for an all-equity firm in this business is 11%, and IA can borrow
at a rate rd = 6%. Assume that the MM assumptions apply.

Argent paid $2 in dividends and retained $2 per share. Since total retained
earnings rose by $12 million, there must be 6 million shares outstanding.
With a book value of $40 per share, total common equity must be
$40(6 million) = $240 million. Since Argent has $120 million of debt, its
debt ratio must be 33.3%:

Jacobus’s average sales per day were $1,000/365 ¼ $2.7397 million. Its DSO
was 40.55, so accounts receivable equal 40.55($2.7397) = $111.1 million. Its
new DSO of 30.4 would cause AR ¼ 30.4($2.7397) ¼ $83.3 million. The
reduction in receivables would be $111.1 −$83.3 ¼ $27.8 million, which
would equal the amount of cash generated.

This problem can be approached in several ways. Perhaps the simplest
is to ask this question: “If I received $750 1 year from now and

¼ $735:03
This is less than the $750 lump sum offer, so your initial reaction might
be to accept the lump sum of $750. However, it would be a mistake to
do so. The problem is that, when you found the $735.03 PVof the
annuity, you were finding the value of the annuity today. You were
comparing $735.03 today with the lump sum of $750 in 1 year. This is,
of course, invalid. What you should have done was take the $735.03,
recognize that this is the PV of an annuity as of today, multiply $735.03
by 1.08 to get $793.83, and compare this $793.83 with the lump sum of
$750. You would then take your father’s offer to make the payments
rather than take the lump sum 1 year from now.

same effective annual rate of 8.24%. The difference in their quoted rates
is due to the difference in compounding frequency.

Thus, on March 1, 2010, there were 132=3 periods left before the bond

and FV ¼ 1000; then solve for PV ¼ −$859.76.
(2) Add the coupon, $60, to the bond price to get the total value, TV,
of the bond on the next interest payment date: TV ¼ $859.76 +
$60.00 ¼ $919.76.
(3) Discount this total value back to the purchase date:

Using a financial calculator, input N ¼ 4/6, I/YR ¼ 7.75, PMT ¼ 0,

(4) Therefore, you would have written a check for $875.11 to complete
the transaction. Of this amount, $20 ¼ (⅓)($60) would represent

The average rate of return for each stock is calculated simply by averaging
the returns over the 5-year period. The average return for Stock A is
rAvg A ¼ ð−18% þ 44% −22% þ 22% þ 34%Þ=5
¼ 12%
The realized rate of return on a portfolio made up of Stock A and Stock B
would be calculated by finding the average return in each year as
rAð% of Stock AÞ þ rBð% of Stock BÞ
and then averaging these annual returns:

Because the risk reduction from diversification is small (σAB falls only from
30% to 29%), the most likely value of the correlation coefficient is 0.8. If
the correlation coefficient were −0.8, then the risk reduction would be much
larger. In fact, the correlation coefficient between Stocks A and B is 0.8.
d.
If more randomly selected stocks were added to a portfolio, σP would
decline to somewhere in the vicinity of 20%. The value of σP would
remain constant only if the correlation coefficient were +1.0, which is
most unlikely. The value of σP would decline to zero only if (1) the
correlation coefficient ρ were equal to zero and a large number of

With 0.6 shares, the stock’s payoff will be either 0.6($60) ¼ $36 or
0.6($30) ¼ $18. The portfolio’s payoff will be $36 −$18 ¼ $18, or $18 −
0 ¼ $18.
The present value of $18 at the daily compounded risk-free rate
is PV ¼ $18 / [1 + (0.05/365)]365 ¼ $17.12. The option price is
the current value of the stock in the portfolio minus the PV of the

ð1:12Þ1 þ $3;500
ð1:12Þ2 þ $3;500
ð1:12Þ3 þ $3;500
ð1:12Þ4 ¼ $630:72
Alternatively, using a financial calculator, input the cash flows into the cash flow
register, enter I/YR ¼ 12, and then press the NPV key to obtain NPVX ¼
$966.01 and NPVY ¼ $630.72.
Internal rate of return (IRR):
To solve for each project’s IRR, find the discount rates that equate each NPV
to zero:
IRRX ¼ 18:0%
IRRY ¼ 15:0%
Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR):
To obtain each project’s MIRR, begin by finding each project’s terminal value
(TV) of cash inflows:
TVX ¼ $6;500ð1:12Þ3 þ $3;000ð1:12Þ2 þ $3;000ð1:12Þ1 þ $1;000 ¼ $17;255:23
TVY ¼ $3;500ð1:12Þ3 þ $3;500ð1:12Þ2 þ $3;500ð1:12Þ1 þ $3;500 ¼ $16;727:65
Now, each project’s MIRR is the discount rate that equates the PV of the TV to
each project’s cost, $10,000:
MIRRX ¼ 14:61%
MIRRY ¼ 13:73%
Profitability index (PI):
To obtain each project’s PI, divide its present value of future cash flows by its initial
cost. The PV of future cash flows can be found from the NPV calculated earlier:
PVX ¼ NPVX þ Cost of X ¼ $966:01 þ $10;000 ¼ $10;966:01
PVY ¼ NPVY þ Cost of Y ¼ $630:72 þ $10;000 ¼ $10;630:72
PIX ¼ PVX=Cost of X ¼ $10;966:01=$10;000 ¼ 1:097
PIY ¼ PVY=Cost of Y ¼ $10;630:72=$10;000 ¼ 1:063

b.
The following table summarizes the project rankings by each method:
Project That Ranks Higher
Payback
X
NPV
X
IRR
X
MIRR
X
Note that all methods rank Project X over Project Y. Because both
projects are acceptable under the NPV, IRR, and MIRR criteria, both
should be accepted if they are independent.
c.
In this case, we would choose the project with the higher NPV at r ¼ 12%,
or Project X.
d.
To determine the effects of changing the cost of capital, plot the NPV
profiles of each project. The crossover rate occurs at about 6% to 7%
(6.2%). See the graph below.
If the firm’s cost of capital is less than 6.2%, then a conflict exists because
NPVY > NPVX but IRRX > IRRY. Therefore, if r were 5% then a conflict
would exist. Note, however, that when r ¼ 5.0% we have MIRRX ¼
10.64% and MIRRY ¼ 10.83%; hence, the modified IRR ranks the projects
correctly even if r is to the left of the crossover point.
e.
The
basic
cause
of
the
conflict
is
differing
reinvestment
rate
assumptions between NPV and IRR: NPV assumes that cash flows can
be reinvested at the cost of capital, whereas IRR assumes that
reinvestment yields the (generally) higher IRR. The high reinvestment
rate assumption under IRR makes early cash flows especially valuable,
so short-term projects look better under IRR.

ð1:10Þ2 þ $30;000
ð1:10Þ3

Alternatively, using a financial calculator, input the cash flows in the
cash flow register, enter I/YR ¼ 10, and then press the NPV key to
obtain NPV ¼ $24,900.

ð1:10Þ4 þ $20;000
ð1:10Þ5 ¼ −$24;184
Similarly, for the best case, use the values from the column farthest on
the right. Here the NPV is $70,259.
1044
Appendix A: Solutions to Self-Test Problems

If the cash flows are perfectly dependent, then the low cash flow in the
first year will mean a low cash flow in every year. Thus, the probability
of the worst case occurring is the probability of getting the $20,000 net
cash flow in Year 1, or 20%. If the cash flows are independent, then the
cash flow in each year can be low, high, or average and so the
probability of getting all low cash flows will be
ð0:2Þð0:2Þð0:2Þð0:2Þð0:2Þ ¼ 0:25 ¼ 0:00032 ¼ 0:032%
c.
The base-case NPV is found using the most likely cash flows and is
equal to $26,142. This value differs from the expected NPV of
$24,900 because the Year-5 cash flows are not symmetric. Under these
conditions, the NPV distribution is as follows:
P
NPV
0.2
−$24,184
0.6
26,142
0.2
70,259
Thus, the expected NPV is 0.2(−$24,184) + 0.6($26,142) + 0.2($70,259) ¼
$24,900. As is always the case, the expected NPV is the same as the NPV
of the expected cash flows found in part a. The standard deviation is $29,904:

CHAPTER 12

To solve this problem, we first define ∆S as the change in sales and g as the
growth rate in sales. Then we use the three following equations:
ΔS ¼ S0g
S1 ¼ S0ð1 þ gÞ
AFN ¼ ðA=S0ÞðΔSÞ −ðL=S0ÞðΔSÞ −MS1ð1 −Payout ratioÞ
Set AFN = 0; substitute in known values for A*/S0, L*/S0, M, d, and S0; and
then solve for g:

g ¼ $5:5=$114:5 ¼ 0:048 ¼ 4:8%

ST-2
Assets consist of cash, marketable securities, receivables, inventories, and fixed
assets. Therefore, we can break the A*/S0 ratio into its components—
cash/sales, inventories/sales, and so forth. Then,
A
S0
¼ A −Inventories
S0
þ Inventories
S0
¼ 1:6
Appendix A: Solutions to Self-Test Problems
1045

We know that the inventory turnover ratio is sales/inventories ¼ 3 times,
so inventories/sales ¼ 1/3 ¼ 0.3333. Further, if the inventory turnover ratio
can be increased to 4 times, then the inventory/sales ratio will fall to 1/4 ¼ 0.25,
a difference of 0.3333 −0.2500 ¼ 0.0833. This, in turn, causes the A*/S0
ratio to fall from A*/S0 ¼ 1.6 to A*/S0 ¼ 1.6 −0.0833 ¼ 1.5167. This change
has two effects: First, it changes the AFN equation; and second, it means
that Barnsdale currently has excessive inventories. Because it is costly to
hold excess inventories, Barnsdale will want to reduce its inventory hold-
ings by not replacing inventories until the excess amounts have been used.
We can account for this by setting up the revised AFN equation (using the
new A*/S0 ratio), estimating the funds that will be needed next year if no
excess inventories are currently on hand, and then subtracting out the
excess inventories that are currently on hand:
Present Conditions:
Sales
Inventories ¼
$100
Inventories ¼ 3
so
Inventories ¼ $100=3 ¼ $33:3 million at present
New Conditions:
Sales
Inventories ¼
$100
Inventories ¼ 4
so
New level of inventories ¼ $100=4 ¼ $25 million
Therefore,
Excess inventories ¼ $33:3−$25 ¼ $8:3 million

+ $8,972,762.646 −$10,972,762.646 ¼ $19,945,525.29. The stock price
prior to the repurchase is PPrior = SPrior/nPrior ¼ $19,945,525.29/600,000 ¼
$33.242542. The firm used the proceeds of the new debt, $8,972,762.646,
to repurchase X shares of stock at a price of $33.242542 per share. The
number of shares it will repurchase is X ¼ $8,972,762.646/$33.242542 ¼
269,918.07. Thus, there are 600,000 −269,918.07 ¼ 330,082 shares
remaining. As a check, the stock price should equal the market value of
equity (S) divided by the number of shares: P0 ¼ $10,972,762.646/330,082
¼ $33.2425.

The Vanderheiden Press has a higher ROE when short-term interest rates
are high, whereas Herrenhouse Publishing does better when rates are
lower.
c. Herrenhouse’s position is riskier. First, its profits and return on equity
are much more volatile than Vanderheiden’s. Second, Herrenhouse
must renew its large short-term loan every year, and if the renewal
comes up at a time when money is tight or when its business is depressed
or both, then Herrenhouse could be denied credit, which could put it
out of business.

Cost of Owning:
In our solution, we will consider the $40,000 cost as a Year-0
outflow rather than including all the financing cash flows. The net
effect is the same because the PV of the financing flows, when
discounted at the after-tax cost of debt, is the cost of the asset.

Since the present value of the cost of leasing is less than the present
value of the cost of owning, the truck should be leased. Specifically,
the NAL is $23,035 −$22,038 ¼ $997.
c.
Use the cost of debt because most cash flows are fixed by contract and
thus are relatively certain; therefore, lease cash flows have about the
same risk as the firm’s debt. Also, leasing is considered as a substitute for
debt. Use an after-tax cost rate to account for interest tax deductibility.

Second issue: 10-year bonds with 4.5% annual coupon with warrants.
Both bonds issued at par $1,000. Value of warrants ¼ ?
First issue: N ¼ 10, PV ¼ −1000, PMT ¼ 60, and FV ¼ 1000; then solve
for I/YR ¼ rd ¼ 6%. (Since it sold for par, we should know that rd ¼ 6%.)
Second issue: $1,000 ¼ Bond + Warrants. This bond should be evaluated
at 6% (since we know the first issue sold at par) in order to determine its
present value: N ¼ 10, I/YR ¼ rd ¼ 6, PMT ¼ 45, and FV ¼ 1000; then solve
for PV ¼ $889.60.
The value of the warrants can be determined as the difference between
$1,000 and the second bond’s present value:
Value of warrants ¼ $1;000 −$889:6 ¼ $110:40:

CHAPTER 23
ST-1
a.
The hypothetical bond in the futures contract has an annual coupon of
6% (paid semiannually) and a maturity of 20 years. At a price of 97’13
(this is the percent of par), a $1,000 par bond would have a price of
$1,000(97 + 13/32)/100 ¼ $974.0625. To find the yield: N ¼ 40,
PMT ¼ 30, FV ¼ 1000, PV ¼ −974.0625; then I ¼ 3.1143% per
6 months. The nominal annual yield is 2(3.1143%) ¼ 6.2286%.
b.
In this situation, the firm would be hurt if interest rates were to rise by
September, so it would use a short hedge or sell futures contracts.
Because futures contracts are for $100,000 in Treasury bonds, the value
of a futures contract is $97,406.25 and the firm must sell
$5,000,000/$97,406.25 = 51.33 ≈51 contracts to cover the planned
$5,000,000 September bond issue. Because futures maturing in June are
selling for 97 13/32 of par, the value of Wansley’s futures is about
51($97,406.25) ¼ $4,967,718.75. Should interest rates rise by September,
Wansley will be able to repurchase the futures contracts at a lower cost,
which will help offset their loss from financing at the higher interest rate.
Thus, the firm has hedged against rising interest rates.
c.
The firm would now pay 13% on the bonds. With a 12% coupon rate,
the PV of the new issue is only $4,646,361.83 (N ¼ 40, I ¼ 13/2 ¼ 6.5,
PMT ¼ −0.12/2(5000000) ¼ −300000, FV ¼ −5000000; then solve for
PV). Therefore, the new bond issue would bring in only $4,646,361.83,
so the cost of the bond issue that is due to rising rates is $5,000,000 −
$4,646,361.83 = $353,638.17.
However, the value of the short futures position began at
$4,967,718.75. Now, if interest rates increased by 1 percentage point, then
the yield on the futures would go up to 7.2286% (7.2286 ¼ 6.2286 + 1).
To find the value of the futures contract, enter N = 40, I ¼ 7.2286/2 ¼
3.6143 (from part a), PMT = 3000, and FV = 100000; then solve for PV ¼
$87,111.04 per contract. With 51 contracts, the value of the futures
position is $4,442,663.04. (Note: If you don’t round off in any previous
calculations, then the PV comes to $4,442,668.38.)
Because Wansley Company sold the futures contracts for $4,967,718.75
and will, in effect, buy them back at $4,442,668.04, the firm would make a
profit of $4,967,718.75 −$4,442,668.04 ¼ $525,050.71 profit on the
transaction (if we ignore transaction costs).
Thus, the firm gained $525,050.71 on its futures position, but lost
$353,638.17 on its underlying bond issue. On net, it gained $525,050.71
−$353,638.17 ¼ $171,412.54.

The existence of the riskless asset would enable you to go to the
CAPM. We would draw in the CML as shown on the graph in part
d. Now you would hold a portfolio of stocks, borrowing on margin to
hold more stocks than your net worth, and move to a higher
indifference curve, IC2.
You can put all of your money into the riskless asset, all in A, all in
B, or some in each security. The most logical choices are (1) hold a
portfolio of A and B plus some of the riskless asset, (2) hold only a
portfolio of A and B, or (3) hold a portfolio of A and B and borrow to
leverage the portfolio, assuming you can borrow at the riskless rate.
Reading from the graph, we see that your ^rp at the point of
tangency between your IC2 and the CML is about 22%. We can use
this information to find out how much you invest in the market
portfolio and how much you invest in the riskless asset. (It will turn
out that you have a negative investment in the riskless asset, which
means that you borrow rather than lend at the risk-free rate.)

Your indifference curve suggests that you are not very risk averse. A
risk-averse investor would have a steep indifference curve (visualize a
set of steep curves that were tangent to CML to the left of Point C).
This investor would hold some of A and B, combined to form portfolio
M, and some of the riskless asset.
g.
Given your assumed indifference curve, you would, when the riskless asset
becomes available, change your portfolio from the one found in part e
(with ^rp ¼ 18% and σp ¼ 13.5%) to one with ^rp ≈22.0% and σp ≈15.00%.

Note that the 16.8% value for rM was approximated from the graph. Also,
this solution assumes that you can borrow at rRF ¼ 10%. This is a basic—
but questionable—CAPM assumption. If the borrowing rate is above rRF,
then the CML would turn down to the right of Point M.

Glossary
A
abandonment option
Allows a company to
reduce the capacity of its output in response to
changing market conditions. This includes the
option to contract production or abandon a project
if market conditions deteriorate too much.
absolute priority doctrine
States that claims
must be paid in strict accordance with the priority
of each claim, regardless of the consequence to
other claimants.
account receivable
Created when a good is
shipped or a service is performed, and payment
for that good is made on a credit basis, not on a
cash basis.
accounting income
Income as defined by Gen-
erally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
accounting profit
A firm’s net income as
reported on its income statement.
acquiring company
A company that seeks to
acquire another firm.
actual, or realized, rate of return, r¯s
The rate
of return that was actually realized at the end of
some holding period.
additional funds needed (AFN)
Those funds
required from external sources to increase the
firm’s assets to support a sales increase. A sales
increase will normally require an increase in assets.
However, some of this increase is usually offset by a
spontaneous increase in liabilities as well as by
earnings retained in the firm. Those funds that
are required but not generated internally must be
obtained from external sources.
add-on basis installment loan
Interest is calcu-
lated over the life of the loan and then added on to
the loan amount. This total amount is paid in equal
installments. This raises the effective cost of the loan.
agency cost or problem
An expense, either direct
or indirect, that is borne by a principal as a result of
having delegated authority to an agent. An example
is the costs borne by shareholders to encourage
managers to maximize a firm’s stock price rather
than act in their own self-interests. These costs may
also arise from lost efficiency and the expense of
monitoring management to ensure that debtholders’
rights are protected.
agency debt
Debt issued by federal agencies.
Agency debt is not officially backed by the full faith
and credit of the U.S. government, but investors
assume that the government implicitly guarantees
this debt, so these bonds carry interest rates only
slightly higher than Treasury bonds.
aggressive short-term financing policy
Refers to
a policy in which a firm finances all of its fixed assets
with long-term capital but part of its permanent
current assets with short-term, nonspontaneous
credit.
aging schedule
Breaks down accounts receivable
according to how long they have been outstanding.
This gives the firm a more complete picture of the
1087

structure of accounts receivable than that provided
by days sales outstanding.
alternative minimum tax (AMT)
A provision of
the U.S. Tax Code that requires profitable firms to
pay at least some taxes if such taxes are greater than
the amount due under standard tax accounting.
amortization
A noncash charge against intangible
assets, such as goodwill.
amortization schedule
A table that breaks down
the periodic fixed payment of an installment loan
into its principal and interest components.
amortized loan
A loan that is repaid in equal
periodic amounts (or “killed off ”) over time.
anchoring bias
Occurs when predictions of future
events are influenced too heavily by recent events.
animal spirits
John Maynard Keynes, writing dur-
ing the 1920s and 1930s, suggested that—after a period
of rising prosperity and stock prices—investors begin
to think that the good times will last forever, a feeling
that is driven by happy talk and high spirits rather than
cool reasoning.
annual report
A report issued annually by a corpo-
ration to its stockholders. It contains basic financial
statements as well as management’s opinion of the past
year’s operations and the firm’s future prospects.
annual vesting
A certain percentage of the options
in a grant vest each year. For example, one-third of
the options in the grant might vest each year.
annuity
A series of payments of a fixed amount for
a specified number of periods.
annuity due
An annuity with payments occurring
at the beginning of each period.
APR
The nominal annual interest rate is also
called the annual percentage rate, or APR.
arbitrage
The simultaneous buying and selling of
the same commodity or security in two different
markets at different prices, thus yielding a risk-free
return.
Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)
An approach to
measuring the equilibrium risk–return relationship
for a given stock as a function of multiple factors,
rather than the single factor (the market return) used
by the CAPM. The APT is based on complex
mathematical and statistical theory, and it can
account for several factors (such as GNP and the
level of inflation) in determining the required return
for a particular stock.
arrearages
Preferred dividends that have not been
paid and hence are “in arrears.”
asset management ratios
A set of ratios that
measure how effectively a firm is managing its assets.
assets-in-place
Refers to the land, buildings,
machines, and inventory that the firm uses in its
operations to produce its products and services. Also
known as operating assets.
assignment
An informal procedure for liquidating
debts that transfers title to a debtor’s assets to a third
person, known as an assignee or trustee.
asymmetric information theory
Assumes
managers have more complete information than
investors and leads to a preferred “pecking order” of
financing: (1) retained earnings, followed by (2) debt,
and then (3) new common stock. Also known as
signaling theory.
average stock’s beta, bA = bM
The beta coefficient
(b) is a measure of a stock’s market risk. It measures the
stock’s volatility relative to an average stock, which has a
beta of 1.0.
average tax rate
Calculated by taking the total
amount of tax paid divided by taxable income.
B
balance sheet
A statement of the firm’s financial
position at a specific point in time. The firm’s assets
are listed on the left-hand side of the balance sheet;
the right-hand side shows its liabilities and equity, or
the claims against these assets.
banker’s acceptance
Created when an importer’s
bank promises to accept a postdated check written to
an exporter even if there are insufficient funds in the
importer’s account. If the bank is strong, then this
financial instrument virtually eliminates credit risk.
Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978
Enacted to
speed up and streamline bankruptcy proceedings.
This law represented a shift to a relative priority
doctrine of creditors’ claims.
basic earning power (BEP) ratio
Calculated by
dividing earnings before interest and taxes by total
assets. This ratio shows the raw earning power of the
1088
Glossary

firm’s assets before the influence of taxes and
leverage.
behavioral finance
A field of study that analyzes
investor behavior as a result of psychological traits. It
does not assume that investors necessarily behave
rationally.
benchmarking
When a firm compares its ratios to
other leading companies in the same industry.
best efforts arrangement
A type of contract with
an investment banker when issuing stock. In a best
efforts sale, the investment banker is only committed
to making every effort to sell the stock at the offering
price. In this case, the issuing firm bears the risk that
the new issue will not be fully subscribed.
beta coefficient, b
A measure of a stock’s market
risk, or the extent to which the returns on a given
stock move with the stock market.
bird-in-the-hand theory
Assumes that investors
value a dollar of dividends more highly than a dollar
of expected capital gains, because a certain dividend
is less risky than a possible capital gain. This theory
implies that a high-dividend stock has a higher price
and lower required return, all else held equal.
Black-Scholes option pricing model
A model to
estimate the value of a call option. It is widely used
by options traders.
bond
A promissory note issued by a business or a
governmental unit.
book value per share
Common equity divided by
the number of shares outstanding.
break-even point
The level of unit sales at which
costs equal revenues.
breakup value
A firm’s value if its assets are sold
off in pieces.
business risk
The risk inherent in the operations of
the firm, prior to the financing decision. Thus, business
risk is the uncertainty inherent in future operating
income or earnings before interest and taxes. Business
risk is caused by many factors; two of the most impor-
tant are sales variability and operating leverage.
C
call option
An option that allows the holder to buy
the asset at some predetermined price within a
specified period of time.
call provision
Gives the issuing corporation the
right to call the bonds for redemption. The call
provision generally states that if the bonds are called
then the company must pay the bondholders an
amount greater than the par value, or a call premium.
Most bonds contain a call provision.
capacity option
Allows a company to change the
capacity of its output in response to changing market
conditions. This includes the option to contract or
expand production. It also includes the option to
abandon a project if market conditions deteriorate
too much.
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
A model
based on the proposition that any stock’s required
rate of return is equal to the risk-free rate of return
plus a risk premium reflecting only the risk remain-
ing after diversification. The CAPM equation is
ri = rRF + bi(rM −rRF).
capital budget
Outlines the planned expenditures
on fixed assets.
capital budgeting
The whole process of analyzing
projects and deciding whether they should be
included in the capital budget.
capital gain (loss)
The profit (loss) from the sale
of a capital asset for more (less) than its purchase
price.
capital gains yield
Results from changing prices
and is calculated as (P1 −P0)/P0, where P0 is the
beginning-of-period price and P1 is the end-
of-period price.
capital intensity ratio
The dollar amount of assets
required to produce a dollar of sales. The capital
intensity ratio is the reciprocal of the total assets
turnover ratio.
capital market
Capital markets are the financial
markets for long-term debt and corporate stocks.
The New York Stock Exchange is an example of a
capital market.
capital rationing
Occurs when management places
a constraint on the size of the firm’s capital budget
during a particular period.
capital structure
The manner in which a firm’s
assets are financed; that is, the right side of the balance
sheet. Capital structure is normally expressed as the
percentage of each type of capital used by the firm
such as debt, preferred stock, and common equity.
Glossary
1089

capitalizing
Incorporating the lease provisions
into the balance sheet by reporting the leased asset
under fixed assets and reporting the present value of
future lease payments as debt.
cash budget
A schedule showing cash flows
(receipts, disbursements, and cash balances) for a
firm over a specified period.
cash conversion cycle
The length of time
between the firm’s actual cash expenditures on
productive resources (materials and labor) and its
own cash receipts from the sale of products (that is,
the length of time between paying for labor and
materials and collecting on receivables). Thus, the
cash conversion cycle equals the length of time the
firm has funds tied up in current assets.
cash discounts
The amount by which a seller is
willing to reduce the invoice price in order to be
paid immediately, rather than in the future. A cash
discount might be 2/10, net 30, which means a 2%
discount if the bill is paid within 10 days
and otherwise the entire amount is due within
30 days.
CDO, collateralized debt obligation
Created
when large numbers of mortgages are bundled into
pools to create new securities that are then sliced
into tranches; the tranches are re-combined and
re-divided into securities called CDOs.
CDS, credit default swap
Derivative in which a
counterparty pays if a specified debt instrument goes
into default; similar to insurance on a bond.
Chapter 11
The business reorganization chapter
of the Bankruptcy Reform Act. The chapter provides
for the reorganization, rather than the liquidation, of
a business.
Chapter 7
The chapter of the Bankruptcy Reform
Act that provides for the liquidation of a firm to
repay creditors.
characteristic line
Obtained by regressing the
historical returns on a particular stock against the
historical returns on the general stock market. The
slope of the characteristic line is the stock’s beta,
which measures the amount by which the stock’s
expected return increases for a given increase in the
expected return on the market.
charter
The legal document that is filed with the
state to incorporate a company.
check-clearing process
When a customer’s check
is written upon one bank and a company deposits the
check in its own bank, the company’s bank must
verify that the check is valid before the company can
use those funds. Checks are generally cleared
through the Federal Reserve System or through a
clearinghouse set up by the banks in a particular city.
classified boards
A board of directors with stag-
gered terms. For example, a board with one-third of
the seats filled each year and directors serving three-
year terms.
classified stock
Sometimes created by a firm to
meet special needs and circumstances. Generally,
when special classifications of stock are used, one
type is designated “Class A,” another as “Class B,”
and so on. For example, Class A might be entitled to
receive dividends before dividends can be paid on
Class B stock. Class B might have the exclusive right
to vote.
cleanup clause
A clause in a line of credit that
requires the borrower to reduce the loan balance to
zero at least once a year.
clientele effect
The attraction of companies with
specific dividend policies to those investors whose
needs are best served by those policies. Thus,
companies with high dividends will have a clientele
of investors with low marginal tax rates and strong
desires for current income. Conversely, companies
with low dividends will have a clientele of investors
with high marginal tax rates and little need for
current income.
cliff vesting
All the options in a grant vest on the
same date.
closely held corporation
Refers to companies that
are so small that their common stocks are not
actively traded; they are owned by only a few people,
usually the companies’ managers.
coefficient of variation, CV
Equal to the standard
deviation divided by the expected return; it is a
standardized risk measure that allows comparisons
between investments having different expected
returns and standard deviations.
collection policy
The procedure for collecting
accounts receivable. A change in collection policy
will affect sales, days sales outstanding, bad debt
losses, and the percentage of customers taking
discounts.
1090
Glossary

collections float
Float created while funds from
customers’ checks are being deposited and cleared
through the check collection process.
combination lease
Combines some aspects of
both operating and financial leases. For example, a
financial lease that contains a cancellation clause—
normally associated with operating leases—is a
combination lease.
commercial paper
Unsecured, short-term prom-
issory notes of large firms, usually issued in
denominations of $100,000 or more and having an
interest rate somewhat below the prime rate.
commodity futures
Futures contracts that involve
the sale or purchase of various commodities, including
grains, oilseeds, livestock, meats, fiber, metals, and wood.
common stockholders’ equity (net worth)
The
capital supplied by common stockholders—capital
stock, paid-in capital, retained earnings, and (occasion-
ally) certain reserves. Paid-in capital is the difference
between the stock’s par value and what stockholders
paid when they bought newly issued shares.
comparative ratio analysis
Compares a firm’s
own ratios to other leading companies in the same
industry. This technique is also known as
benchmarking.
compensating balance (CB)
A minimum check-
ing account balance that a firm must maintain with a
bank to compensate the bank for services rendered
or for making a loan; generally equal to 10%–20% of
the loans outstanding.
composition
Creditors voluntarily reduce their
fixed claims on the debtor by accepting a lower
principal amount, reducing the interest rate on the
debt, accepting equity in place of debt, or some
combination of these changes.
compounding
The process of finding the future
value of a single payment or series of payments.
computer/telephone network
A computer/tele-
phone network, such as Nasdaq, consists of all the
facilities that provide for security transactions not
conducted at a physical location exchange. These
facilities are, basically, the communications networks
that link buyers and sellers.
congeneric merger
Involves firms that are interre-
lated but do not have identical lines of business.
conglomerate merger
Occurs when unrelated
enterprises combine.
conservative short-term financing policy
Refers
to using permanent capital to finance all permanent
asset requirements as well as to meet some or all of
the seasonal demands.
consol
A type of perpetuity. Consols were origi-
nally bonds issued by England in the mid-1700s to
consolidate past debt.
continuous probability distribution
Contains an
infinite number of outcomes and is graphed from
−∞and +∞.
conversion price
The effective price per share of
stock if conversion occurs; the par value of the
convertible security divided by the conversion ratio.
conversion ratio
The number of shares of
common stock received upon conversion of one
convertible security.
conversion value
The value of the stock that the
investor would receive if conversion occurred; the
market price per share times the conversion ratio.
convertible bond
Security that is convertible into
shares of common stock, at a fixed price, at the
option of the bondholder.
convertible currency
A currency that can be
traded in the currency markets and can be redeemed
at current market rates.
convertible security
Bonds or preferred stocks
that can be exchanged for (converted into) common
stock, under specific terms, at the option of the
holder. Unlike the exercise of warrants, conversion
of a convertible security does not provide additional
capital to the issuer.
corporate alliance
A cooperative deal that stops
short of a merger; also called a strategic alliance.
corporate bond
Debt issued by corporations and
exposed to default risk. Different corporate bonds
have different levels of default risk, depending on the
issuing company’s characteristics and on the terms of
the specific bond.
corporate governance
The set of rules that
control a company’s behavior toward its directors,
managers, employees, shareholders, creditors,
customers, competitors, and community.
Glossary
1091

corporate risk management
Managing unpre-
dictable events that have adverse consequences for
the firm. This effort involves reducing the conse-
quences of risk to the point where there would be no
significant adverse impact on the firm’s financial
position.
corporate valuation model
Defines the total value
of a company as the value of operations plus the
value of nonoperating assets plus the value of growth
options.
corporation
A corporation is a legal entity created
by a state. The corporation is separate and distinct
from its owners and managers.
correlation
The tendency of two variables to move
together.
correlation coefficient, ρ (rho)
A standardized
measure of how two random variables covary. A
correlation coefficient (ρ) of +1.0 means that the two
variables move up and down in perfect synchroniza-
tion, whereas a coefficient of −1.0 means the vari-
ables always move in opposite directions. A
correlation coefficient of zero suggests that the two
variables are not related to one another; that is, they
are independent.
cost of common stock, rs
The return required by
the firm’s common stockholders. It is usually calculated
using Capital Asset Pricing Model or the dividend
growth model.
cost of new external common equity, re
A proj-
ect financed with external equity must earn a higher
rate of return because it must cover the flotation costs.
Thus, the cost of new common equity is higher than
that of common equity raised internally by reinvesting
earnings.
cost of preferred stock, rps
The return required by
the firm’s preferred stockholders. The cost of preferred
stock, rps, is the cost to the firm of issuing new preferred
stock. For perpetual preferred, it is the preferred
dividend, Dps, divided by the net issuing price, Pn.
costly trade credit
Credit taken (in excess of free
trade credit) whose cost is equal to the discount lost.
coupon interest rate
Stated rate of interest on a
bond; defined as the coupon payment divided by the
par value.
coupon payment
Dollar amount of interest paid
to each bondholder on the interest payment dates.
coverage ratio
Similar to the times-interest-
earned ratio, but it recognizes that many firms
lease assets and also must make sinking fund pay-
ments. It is found by adding earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization
(EBITDA), and lease payments and then dividing
this total by interest charges, lease payments, and
sinking fund payments over 1 −T (where T is the
tax rate).
cramdown
Reorganization plans that are man-
dated by the bankruptcy court and binding on all
parties.
credit period
The length of time for which credit
is extended. If the credit period is lengthened then
sales will generally increase, as will accounts receiv-
able. This will increase the firm’s financing needs
and possibly increase bad debt losses. A shortening of
the credit period will have the opposite effect.
credit policy
The firm’s policy on granting and
collecting credit. There are four elements of credit
policy, or credit policy variables: credit period, credit
standards, collection policy, and discounts.
credit standards
The financial strength and cred-
itworthiness that qualifies a customer for a firm’s
regular credit terms.
credit terms
Statements of the credit period and
any discounts offered—for example, 2/10, net 30.
cross rate
The exchange rate between two
non-U.S. currencies.
crossover rate
The cost of capital at which the
NPV profiles for two projects intersect.
cumulative preferred dividends
A protective
feature on preferred stock that requires all past
preferred dividends to be paid before any common
dividends can be paid.
currency appreciation
Occurs when a particular
currency is worth more than it previously was.
currency depreciation
Occurs when a particular
currency is worth less than it previously was.
current ratio
Indicates the extent to which current
liabilities are covered by those assets expected to be
converted to cash in the near future; it is found by
dividing current assets by current liabilities.
current yield (on a bond)
The annual coupon
payment divided by the current market price.
1092
Glossary

D
days sales outstanding (DSO)
Used to appraise
accounts receivable and indicates the length of time
the firm must wait after making a sale before
receiving cash. It is found by dividing receivables by
average sales per day.
DCF (discounted cash flow) techniques
The net
present value (NPV) and internal rate of return
(IRR) techniques are discounted cash flow (DCF)
evaluation techniques. These are called DCF meth-
ods because they explicitly recognize the time value
of money.
dealer market
In a dealer market, a dealer holds
an inventory of the security and makes a market by
offering to buy or sell. Others who wish to buy or
sell can see the offers made by the dealers and can
contact the dealer of their choice to arrange a
transaction.
debenture
An unsecured bond; as such, it provides
no lien against specific property as security for the
obligation. Debenture holders are therefore general
creditors whose claims are protected by property not
otherwise pledged.
debt ratio
The ratio of total liabilities to total
assets, it measures the percentage of funds provided
by creditors.
debt-to-equity ratio
Ratio of debt divided by
equity.
decision trees
A form of scenario analysis in which
different actions are taken in different scenarios.
declaration date
The date on which a firm’s
directors issue a statement declaring a dividend.
default risk
The risk that a borrower may not pay
the interest and/or principal on a loan when it
becomes due. If the issuer defaults, investors receive
less than the promised return on the bond. Default
risk is influenced by the financial strength of the
issuer and also by the terms of the bond contract,
especially whether collateral has been pledged to
secure the bond. The greater the default risk, the
higher the bond’s yield to maturity.
default risk premium (DRP)
The premium
added to the real risk-free rate to compensate inves-
tors for the risk that a borrower may fail to pay the
interest and/or principal on a loan when they
become due.
defensive merger
Occurs when one company
acquires another to help ward off a hostile merger
attempt.
depreciation
A noncash charge against tangible
assets, such as buildings or machines. It is taken for
the purpose of showing an asset’s estimated dollar
cost of the capital equipment used up in the
production process.
derivatives
Claims whose value depends on what
happens to the value of some other asset. Futures and
options are two important types of derivatives, and
their values depend on what happens to the prices of
other assets. Therefore, the value of a derivative
security is derived from the value of an underlying
real asset or other security.
detachable warrant
A warrant that can be
detached and traded separately from the underlying
security. Most warrants are detachable.
devaluation
The lowering, by governmental
action, of the price of its currency relative to another
currency. For example, in 1967 the British pound
was devalued from $2.80 per pound to $2.50 per
pound.
development bond
A tax-exempt bond sold by
state and local governments whose proceeds are
made available to corporations for specific uses
deemed (by Congress) to be in the public interest.
direct quotation
When discussing exchange rates,
the number of U.S. dollars required to purchase one
unit of a foreign currency.
disbursement float
Float created before checks
written by a firm have cleared and been deducted
from the firm’s account; disbursement float causes
the firm’s own checkbook balance to be smaller than
the balance on the bank’s records.
discount bond
Bond prices and interest rates are
inversely related; that is, they tend to move in the
opposite direction from one another. A fixed-rate bond
will sell at par when its coupon interest rate is equal to
the going rate of interest, rd. When the going rate of
interest is above the coupon rate, a fixed-rate bond will
sell at a “discount” below its par value. If current
interest rates are below the coupon rate, a fixed-rate
bond will sell at a “premium” above its par value.
discount interest
Interest that is calculated on the
face amount of a loan but is paid in advance.

discount on forward rate
Occurs when the
forward exchange rate differs from the spot rate.
When the forward rate is below the spot rate, the
forward rate is said to be at a discount.
discounted cash flow (DCF) method
A method
of valuing a business that involves the application of
capital budgeting procedures to an entire firm rather
than to a single project.
discounted payback period
The number of years
it takes a firm to recover its project investment based
on discounted cash flows.
discounting
The process of finding the present
value of a single payment or series of payments.

The policy that sets the level
of distributions and the form of the distributions
(dividends and stock repurchases).
diversifiable risk
Refers to that part of a security’s
total risk associated with random events not affecting
the market as a whole. This risk can be eliminated by
proper diversification. Also known as company-
specific risk.
divestiture
The opposite of an acquisition. That is,
a company sells a portion of its assets—often a whole
division—to another firm or individual.
dividend irrelevance theory
Holds that dividend
policy has no effect on either the price of a firm’s
stock or its cost of capital.
dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP)
Allows
stockholders to automatically purchase shares of
common stock of the paying corporation in lieu of
receiving cash dividends. There are two types of
plans: one involves only stock that is already out-
standing; the other involves newly issued stock. In
the first type, the dividends of all participants are
pooled and the stock is purchased on the open mar-
ket. Participants benefit from lower transaction costs.
In the second type, the company issues new shares to
the participants. Thus, the company issues stock in
lieu of the cash dividend.
dividend yield
Defined as either the end-of-period
dividend divided by the beginning-of-period price or
as the ratio of the current dividend to the current
price. Valuation formulas use the former definition.
DuPont chart
A chart designed to show the
relationships among return on investment, asset
turnover, the profit margin, and leverage.
DuPont equation
A formula showing that the rate
of return on equity can be found as the profit margin
multiplied by the product of total assets turnover and
the equity multiplier.
E
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreci-
ation, and amortization.
ECN
In an ECN (electronic communications net-
work), orders from potential buyers and sellers are
automatically matched and the transaction is auto-
matically completed.
economic life
The number of years a project
should be operated to maximize its net present value;
often less than the maximum potential life.
Economic Value Added (EVA)
A method used to
measure a firm’s true profitability. EVA is found by
taking the firm’s after-tax operating profit and sub-
tracting the annual cost of all the capital a firm uses.
If the firm generates a positive EVA, its management
has created value for its shareholders. If the EVA is
negative, management has destroyed shareholder
value.
effective (or equivalent) annual rate (EAR or
EFF%)
The effective annual rate is the rate that,
under annual compounding, would have produced
the same future value at the end of 1 year as was
produced by more frequent compounding, say
quarterly. If the compounding occurs annually, then
the effective annual rate and the nominal rate are the
same. If compounding occurs more frequently,
then the effective annual rate is greater than the
nominal rate.
efficient frontier
The set of efficient portfolios
out of the full set of potential portfolios. On a graph,
the efficient frontier constitutes the boundary line of
the set of potential portfolios.
Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH)
States
(1) that stocks are always in equilibrium and (2) that
it is impossible for an investor to consistently “beat
the market.” The EMH assumes that all important
information regarding a stock is reflected in the price
of that stock.
efficient portfolio
Provides the highest expected
return for any degree of risk. The efficient portfolio
also provides the lowest degree of risk for any
expected return.

embedded options
Options that are a part of
another project. Also called real options, managerial
options, and strategic options.
entrenchment
Occurs when a company has such a
weak board of directors and has such strong anti-
takeover provisions in its corporate charter that
senior managers feel there is little chance of being
removed.
equilibrium
The condition under which the
intrinsic value of a security is equal to its price; also,
when a security’s expected return is equal to its
required return.

A type
of retirement plan in which employees own stock in
the company.
euro
The currency used by nations in the European
Monetary Union.

Specifies the number of units of a
given currency that can be purchased for one unit of
another currency.
exchange rate risk
Refers to the fluctuation in
exchange rates between currencies over time.
ex-dividend date
The date when the right to the
dividend leaves the stock. This date was established
by stockbrokers to avoid confusion, and it is four
business days prior to the holder-of-record date. If
the stock sale is made prior to the ex-dividend date,
then the dividend is paid to the buyer; if the stock is
bought on or after the ex-dividend date, the dividend
is paid to the seller.
exercise price
The price stated in the option
contract at which the security can be bought (or
sold). Also called the strike price.
exercise value
Equal to the current price of the
stock (underlying the option) minus the strike price
of the option.
expectations theory
States that the slope of the
yield curve depends on expectations about future
inflation rates and interest rates. Thus, if the annual
rate of inflation and future interest rates are expected
to increase, then the yield curve will be upward
sloping; the curve will be downward sloping if the
annual rates are expected to decrease.
expected rate of return, r^s
The rate of return
expected on a stock given its current price and
expected future cash flows. If the stock is in equilib-
rium, the required rate of return will equal the
expected rate of return.
extension
A form of debt restructuring in which
creditors postpone the dates of required interest or
principal payments, or both.
extra dividend
A dividend paid, in addition to the
regular dividend, when earnings permit. Firms with
volatile earnings may have a low regular dividend
that can be maintained even in years of low profit
(or high capital investment) but is supplemented by
an extra dividend when excess funds are available.
F
fairness
The standard of fairness states that claims
must be recognized in the order of their legal and
contractual priority. In simpler terms, the reorgani-
zation must be fair to all parties.
Fama-French three-factor model
Includes one

return minus the risk-free rate), a second factor for
size (defined as the return on a portfolio of small
firms minus the return on a portfolio of big firms),
and a third factor for the book-to-market effect
(defined as the return on a portfolio of firms with a
high book-to-market ratio minus the return on a
portfolio of firms with a low book-to-market ratio).

feasibility
The standard of feasibility states that
there must be a reasonably high probability of
successful rehabilitation and profitable future
operations.
feasible set
Represents all portfolios that can be
constructed from a given set of stocks; also known as
the attainable set.
financial distress costs
Incurred when a leveraged
firm facing a decline in earnings is forced to take
actions to avoid bankruptcy. These costs may be the
result of delays in the liquidation of assets, legal fees,
the effects on product quality from cutting costs, and
evasive actions by suppliers and customers.
financial futures
Provide for the purchase or sale
of a financial asset at some time in the future, but at a
price that is established today. Financial futures exist
for Treasury bills, Treasury notes and bonds, certi-
ficates of deposit, Eurodollar deposits, foreign
currencies, and stock indexes.
financial intermediary
Intermediary that buys
securities with funds that it obtains by issuing its own
securities. An example is a common stock mutual
fund that buys common stocks with funds obtained
by issuing shares in the mutual fund.
financial lease
Covers the entire expected life of
the equipment; does not provide for maintenance
service, is not cancellable, and is fully amortized.
financial leverage
The extent to which fixed-
income securities (debt and preferred stock) are used
in a firm’s capital structure. If a high percentage of a
firm’s capital structure is in the form of debt and
preferred stock, then the firm is said to have a high
degree of financial leverage.
financial merger
A merger in which the compa-
nies will not be operated as a single unit and for
which no operating economies are expected.
financial risk
The risk added by the use of debt
financing. Debt financing increases the variability of
earnings before taxes (but after interest); thus, along
with business risk, it contributes to the uncertainty of
net income and earnings per share. Business risk plus
financial risk equals total corporate risk.
financial service corporation
A corporation that
offers a wide range of financial services such as
brokerage operations, insurance, and commercial
banking.
financing feedback
Circularity created when
additional debt causes additional interest expense,
which reduces the addition to retained earnings, which
in turn requires a higher level of debt, which causes still
more interest expense, causing the cycle to be repeated.
fixed assets turnover ratio
The ratio of sales to
net fixed assets; it measures how effectively the firm
uses its plant and equipment.
fixed exchange rate system
The system in effect
from the end of World War II until August 1971.
Under the system, the U.S. dollar was linked to gold
at the rate of $35 per ounce, and other currencies
were then tied to the dollar.
floating exchange rates
The system currently in
effect, where the forces of supply and demand are
allowed to determine currency prices with little
government intervention.
floating-rate bond
A bond whose coupon pay-
ment may vary over time. The coupon rate is usually
linked to the rate on some other security, such as a
Treasury security, or to some other rate, such as the
prime rate or LIBOR.
flotation cost, F
Those costs occurring when a
company issues a new security, including fees to an
investment banker and legal fees.
forecasted financial statements approach
A
method of forecasting financial statements to deter-
mine the additional funds needed. Many items on the
income statement and balance sheets are assumed to
increase proportionally with sales. As sales increase,
these items that are tied to sales also increase, and the
values of these items for a particular year are
estimated as percentages of the forecasted sales for
that year.
foreign bond
A bond sold by a foreign borrower
but denominated in the currency of the country in
which the issue is sold. Thus, a U.S. firm selling
bonds denominated in Swiss francs in Switzerland is
selling foreign bonds.
foreign trade deficit
A deficit that occurs when
businesses and individuals in the United States
import more goods from foreign countries than are
exported.
forward contract
A contract to buy or sell some
item at some time in the future at a price established
when the contract is entered into.

geographical market, and to introduce complemen-
tary products or successive generations of products.
GSE (government-sponsored entity) debt
Debt
issued by government-sponsored entities (GSEs)
such as the Tennessee Valley Authority or the Small
Business Administration; not officially backed by the
full faith and credit of the U.S. government.
guideline lease
Meets all of the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) requirements for a genuine lease. If a
lease meets the IRS guidelines, the IRS allows the
lessor to deduct the asset’s depreciation and allows
the lessee to deduct the lease payments. Also called a
tax-oriented lease.
H

Currencies considered to be
convertible because the nation that issues them
allows them to be traded in the currency markets and
is willing to redeem them at market rates.
hedging

damage due to fluctuating commodity prices, interest
rates, and exchange rates.
herding instinct
When one group of investors
does well, other investors begin to emulate them,
acting like a herd of sheep.
holder-of-record date
If a company lists the
stockholder as an owner on the holder-of-record
date, then the stockholder receives the dividend.
holding company
A corporation formed for the
sole purpose of owning stocks in other companies.
A holding company differs from a stock mutual fund
in that holding companies own sufficient stock in
their operating companies to exercise effective
working control.
holdout
A problematic characteristic of informal
reorganizations whereby all of the involved parties
do not agree to the voluntary plan. Holdouts are
usually made by creditors in an effort to receive full
payment on claims.
horizon value
The value of operations at the end
of the explicit forecast period. It is equal to the
present value of all free cash flows beyond the fore-
cast period, discounted back to the end of the fore-
cast period at the weighted average cost of capital.

horizontal merger
A merger between two com-
panies in the same line of business.

rate. It is the rate used to discount future cash flows
in the net present value method or to compare with
the internal rate of return.
I
improper accumulation
The retention of earnings
by a business for the purpose of enabling stockholders
to avoid personal income taxes on dividends.
income bond
Pays interest only if the interest is
earned. These securities cannot bankrupt a company,
but from an investor’s standpoint, they are riskier
than “regular” bonds.
income statement
Summarizes the firm’s revenues
and expenses over an accounting period. Net sales are
shown at the top of each statement, after which various
costs, including income taxes, are subtracted to obtain
the net income available to common stockholders. The
bottom of the statement reports earnings and divi-
dends per share.
incremental cash flow
Those cash flows that arise
solely from the asset that is being evaluated.
indentures
A legal document that spells out the
rights of both bondholders and the issuing corporation.
independent projects
Projects that can be
accepted or rejected individually.
indexed, or purchasing power, bond
The interest
rate of such a bond is based on an inflation index such as
the consumer price index (CPI), so the interest paid rises
automatically when the inflation rate rises, thus
protecting the bondholders against inflation.
indifference curve
The risk–return trade-off
function for a particular investor; reflects that inves-
tor’s attitude toward risk. An investor would be
indifferent between any pair of assets on the same
indifference curve. In risk–return space, the greater
the slope of the indifference curve, the greater is the
investor’s risk aversion.
indirect quotation
When discussing exchange
rates, the number of units of foreign currency that
can be purchased for one U.S. dollar.
inflation premium (IP)
The premium added to
the real risk-free rate of interest to compensate for
the expected loss of purchasing power. The inflation
premium is the average rate of inflation expected
over the life of the security.
informal debt restructuring
An agreement
between a troubled firm and its creditors to change
existing debt terms. An extension postpones the
required payment date; a composition is a reduction
in creditor claims.
information content, or signaling, hypothesis
A theory that holds that investors regard dividend
changes as “signals” of management forecasts. Thus,
when dividends are raised, this is viewed by investors
as recognition by management of future earnings
increases. Therefore, if a firm’s stock price increases
with a dividend increase, the reason may not be in-
vestor preference for dividends but rather expecta-
tions of higher future earnings. Conversely, a
dividend reduction may signal that management is
forecasting poor earnings in the future.
initial public offering (IPO)
Occurs when a
closely held corporation or its principal stockholders
sell stock to the public at large.
initial public offering (IPO) market
Going pub-
lic is the act of selling stock to the public at large by a
closely held corporation or its principal stockholders,
and this market is often termed the initial public of-
fering market.
INOM
The nominal, or quoted, interest rate.
insiders
The officers, directors, and major stock-
holders of a firm.
interest coverage ratio
Also called the times-
interest-earned (TIE) ratio; determined by dividing
earnings before interest and taxes by the interest expense.
interest rate parity
Holds that investors should
expect to earn the same return in all countries after
adjusting for risk.
interest rate risk
Arises from the fact that bond
prices decline when interest rates rise. Under these
circumstances, selling a bond prior to maturity will
result in a capital loss; the longer the term to matu-
rity, the larger the loss.
interlocking boards of directors
Occur when the
CEO of Company A sits on the board of Company B
while B’s CEO sits on A’s board.
1098
Glossary

internal rate of return (IRR) method
The dis-
count rate that equates the present value of the
expected future cash inflows and outflows. IRR mea-
sures the rate of return on a project, but it assumes
that all cash flows can be reinvested at the IRR rate.
international bond
Any bond sold outside of the
country of the borrower. There are two types of
international bonds: Eurobonds and foreign bonds.
intrinsic (or fundamental) value, P^
0

an issuing firm’s corporate securities and in the sale of
the new securities to investors in the primary market.
investment grade bond
Securities with ratings of
Baa/BBB or above.

option to delay a project rather than implement it
immediately. This option to wait allows a company
to reduce the uncertainty of market conditions

portfolio’s return above or below the Security Market
Line; first suggested by Professor Michael Jensen, it
became popular because of its ease of calculation.
joint venture
Involves the joining together of parts
of companies to accomplish specific, limited objec-
tives. Joint ventures are controlled by the combined
management of the two (or more) parent companies.
junk bond
High-risk, high-yield bond issued to fi-
nanceleveragedbuyouts,mergers,ortroubledcompanies.
L
lessee
The party leasing the property.
lessee’s analysis
Involves determining whether
leasing an asset is less costly than buying the asset.
The lessee will compare the present value cost of
leasing the asset with the present value cost of
purchasing the asset (assuming the funds to purchase
the asset are obtained through a loan). If the present
value cost of the lease is less than the present value
cost of purchasing, then the asset should be leased.
The lessee can also analyze the lease using the IRR
approach or the equivalent loan method.
lessor
The party receiving the payments from the
lease (that is, the owner of the property).
lessor’s analysis
Involves determining the rate of
return on the proposed lease. If the internal rate of
return of the lease cash flows exceeds the lessor’s
opportunity cost of capital, then the lease is a good
investment. This is equivalent to analyzing
whether the net present value of the lease is
positive.
leveraged buyout (LBO)
A transaction in which a
firm’s publicly owned stock is acquired in a mostly
debt-financed tender offer, resulting in a privately
owned, highly leveraged firm. Often, the firm’s own
management initiates the LBO.
leveraged lease
The lessor borrows a portion of
the funds needed to buy the equipment to be leased.
LIBOR

agrees to lend up to a specified maximum amount of
funds during a designated period.
liquidation in bankruptcy
The sale of the assets
of a firm and the distribution of the proceeds to the

added to the real risk-free rate of interest, in addition
to other premiums, if a security is not liquid.
liquidity ratio
A ratio that shows the relationship
of a firm’s cash and other current assets to its current
liabilities.
lockbox plan
A cash management tool in which
incoming checks for a firm are sent to post office
boxes rather than to corporate headquarters. Several
times a day, a local bank will collect the contents of
the lockbox and deposit the checks into the
company’s local account.
long hedges
Occur when futures contracts are
bought in anticipation of (or to guard against) price
increases.
low-regular-dividend-plus-extras policy
Divi-
dend policy in which a company announces a low
regular dividend that it is sure can be maintained; if
extra funds are available, the company pays a
specially designated extra dividend or repurchases
shares of stock.
lumpy assets
Those assets that cannot be acquired
smoothly and instead require large, discrete
additions. For example, an electric utility that is
operating at full capacity cannot add a small amount
of generating capacity, at least not economically.
M
managerial options
Options that give opportu-
nities to managers to respond to changing market
conditions. Also called real options.
margin requirement
The margin is the percent-
age of a stock’s price that an investor has borrowed
in order to purchase the stock. The Securities and
Exchange Commission sets margin requirements,
which is the maximum percentage of debt that can be
used to purchase a stock.
marginal tax rate
The tax rate on the last unit of
income.
market multiple method
Multiplies a market-
determined ratio (called a multiple) to some value of
the target firm to estimate the target’s value. The
market multiple can be based on net income, earnings
per share, sales, book value, or number of subscribers.
market portfolio
A portfolio consisting of all
stocks.
market risk
That part of a security’s total risk that
cannot be eliminated by diversification; measured by
the beta coefficient.
market risk premium, RPM
The difference
between the expected return on the market and the
risk-free rate.
Market Value Added (MVA)
The difference
between the market value of the firm (that is, the
sum of the market value of common equity, the
market value of debt, and the market value of
preferred stock) and the book value of the firm’s
common equity, debt, and preferred stock. If the
book values of debt and preferred stock are equal to
their market values, then MVA is also equal to the
difference between the market value of equity and
the amount of equity capital that investors supplied.
market value ratios
Relate the firm’s stock price
to its earnings and book value per share.
marketable securities
Can be converted to cash
on very short notice and provide at least a modest
return.
maturity date
The date when the bond’s par value
is repaid to the bondholder. Maturity dates generally
range from 10 to 40 years from the time of issue.
maturity matching short-term financing policy
A policy that matches asset and liability maturities. It
is also referred to as the moderate, or self-
liquidating, approach.
maturity risk premium (MRP)
The premium
that must be added to the real risk-free rate of
interest to compensate for interest rate risk, which
depends on a bond’s maturity. Interest rate risk
arises from the fact that bond prices decline when
interest rates rise. Under these circumstances,
selling a bond prior to maturity will result in a
capital loss; the longer the term to maturity, the
larger the loss.
merger
The joining of two firms to form a single
firm.
Miller model
Introduces the effect of personal
taxes into the valuation of a levered firm, which
reduces the advantage of corporate debt financing.
MM Proposition I with corporate taxes

EBIT/rsU. Since both EBIT and rsU are constant, firm
value is also constant and capital structure is irrelevant.
MM Proposition II with corporate taxes
rsL =
rsU + (rsU −rd)(1 −T)(D/S). Here the increase in
equity costs is less than the zero-tax case, and the
increasing use of lower-cost debt causes the firm’s
cost of capital to decrease. In this case, the optimal
capital structure is virtually all debt.
MM Proposition II without taxes
rsL = rsU +
(rsU – rd)(D/S). Thus, rs increases in a precise way as
leverage increases. In fact, this increase is just suffi-
cient to offset the increased use of lower-cost debt.
moderate net operating working capital policy
A policy that matches asset and liability maturities. It
is also referred to as maturity matching or the self-
liquidating approach.
Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR) method
Assumes that cash flows from all projects are rein-
vested at the cost of capital, not at the project’s own
IRR. This makes the modified internal rate of return
a better indicator of a project’s true profitability.
money market
A financial market for debt secu-
rities with maturities of less than 1 year (short-term).
The New York money market is the world’s largest.
money market fund
A mutual fund that invests in
short-term debt instruments and offers investors
check-writing privileges; thus, it amounts to an
interest-bearing checking account.
Monte Carlo simulation analysis
A risk analysis
technique in which a computer is used to simulate
probable future events and thus to estimate the likely
profitability and risk of a project.
mortgage bond
A bond for which a corporation
pledges certain assets as security. All such bonds are
written subject to an indenture.
multinational (or global) corporation
A corpo-
ration that operates in two or more countries.
municipal bond
Issued by state and local govern-
ments. The interest earned on most municipal bonds
is exempt from federal taxes and also from state taxes
if the holder is a resident of the issuing state.
municipal bond insurance
An insurance company
guarantees to pay the coupon and principal payments
should the issuer of the bond (the municipality)
default. This reduces the risk to investors who are
willing to accept a lower coupon rate for an insured
bond issue compared to an uninsured issue.
mutual fund
A corporation that sells shares in the
fund and uses the proceeds to buy stocks, long-term
bonds, or short-term debt instruments. The resulting
dividends, interest, and capital gains are distributed
to the fund’s shareholders after the deduction of
operating expenses. Some funds specialize in certain
types of securities, such as growth stocks, interna-
tional stocks, or municipal bonds.
mutually exclusive projects
Projects that cannot
be performed at the same time. A company could
choose either Project 1 or Project 2, or it can reject
both, but it cannot accept both projects.

The sum of net income plus non-
cash adjustments.
net float
The difference between a firm’s dis-
bursement float and collections float.
net operating working capital (NOWC)
Oper-
ating current assets minus operating current liabilities.
Operating current assets are the current assets used to
support operations, such as cash, accounts receivable,
and inventory. They do not include short-term
investments. Operating current liabilities are the
current liabilities that are a natural consequence of the
firm’s operations, such as accounts payable and
accruals. They do not include notes payable or any
other short-term debt that charges interest.
net present value (NPV) method
Used to assess
the present value of the project’s expected future
cash flows, discounted at the appropriate cost of
capital. NPV is a direct measure of the value of the
project to shareholders.
net working capital
Current assets minus current
liabilities.

new issue market
The market for stock of
companies that go public.
nominal (quoted) interest rate, INOM
The rate
of interest stated in a contract. If the compounding
occurs annually, the effective annual rate and the
nominal rate are the same. If compounding occurs
more frequently, the effective annual rate is greater
than the nominal rate. The nominal annual interest
rate is also called the annual percentage rate, or APR.
nominal rate of return, rn
Includes an inflation
adjustment (premium). Thus, if nominal rates of
return are used in the capital budgeting process, then
the net cash flows must also be nominal.
nominal risk-free rate of interest, rRF
The real
risk-free rate plus a premium for expected inflation.
The short-term nominal risk-free rate is usually
approximated by the U.S. Treasury bill rate, and the
long-term nominal risk-free rate is approximated by
the rate on U.S. Treasury bonds.
nonnormal cash flow projects
Projects with a
large cash outflow either sometime during or at the
end of their lives. A common problem encountered
when evaluating projects with nonnormal cash flows
is multiple internal rates of return.
nonoperating assets
Include investments in mar-
ketable securities and noncontrolling interests in the
stock of other companies.
nonpecuniary benefits
Perks that are not actual
cash payments, such as lavish offices, memberships at
country clubs, corporate jets, and excessively large staffs.
NOPAT (net operating profit after taxes)
The
amount of profit a company would generate if it had
no debt and no financial assets.
normal cash flow project
A project with one or
more cash outflows (costs) followed by a series of
cash inflows.
normal yield curve
When the yield curve slopes
upward it is said to be “normal,” because it is like this
most of the time.
O
off–balance sheet financing
A financing tech-
nique in which a firm uses partnerships and other
arrangements to (in effect) borrow money while not
reporting the liability on its balance sheet. For
example, for many years neither leased assets nor the
liabilities under lease contracts appeared on the
lessees’ balance sheets. To correct this problem, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Statement 13.
open outcry auction
A method of matching
buyers and sellers in which the buyers and sellers are
face-to-face, all stating a price at which they will buy
or sell.
operating capital
The sum of net operating work-
ing capital and operating long-term assets, such as net
plant and equipment. Operating capital also is equal to
the net amount of capital raised from investors. This is
the amount of interest-bearing debt plus preferred
stock plus common equity minus short-term invest-
ments. Also called total net operating capital, net
operating capital, or net operating assets.
operating company
A company controlled by a
holding company.
operating current assets
The current assets used
to support operations, such as cash, accounts receiv-
able, and inventory. It does not include short-term
investments.
operating current liabilities
The current liabili-
ties that are a natural consequence of the firm’s
operations, such as accounts payable and accruals. It
does not include notes payable or any other short-
term debt that charges interest.
operating lease
Provides for both financing and
maintenance. Generally, the operating lease contract
is written for a period considerably shorter than the
expected life of the leased equipment and contains a
cancellation clause; sometimes called a service lease.
operating leverage
The extent to which fixed
costs are used in a firm’s operations. If a high per-
centage of a firm’s total costs are fixed costs, then the
firm is said to have a high degree of operating
leverage. Operating leverage is a measure of one
element of business risk but does not include the
second major element, sales variability.
operating merger
Occurs when the operations of
two companies are integrated with the expectation of
obtaining synergistic gains. These may occur in
response to economies of scale, management
efficiency, or a host of other factors.
operating profit margin
Ratio of earnings before
interest and taxes divided by sales.
1102
Glossary

opportunity cost
A cash flow that a firm must
forgo in order to accept a project. For example, if the
project requires the use of a building that could
otherwise be sold, then the market value of the
building is an opportunity cost of the project.
opportunity cost rate
The rate of return available
on the best alternative investment of similar risk.
optimal distribution policy
The distribution pol-
icy that maximizes the value of the firm by choosing
the optimal level and form of distributions (dividends
and stock repurchases).

The dividend policy that
strikes a balance between current dividends and
future growth and maximizes the firm’s stock price.
optimal portfolio
The point at which the efficient
set of portfolios—the efficient frontier—is just
tangent to the investor’s indifference curve. This point
marks the highest level of satisfaction an investor can
attain given the set of potential portfolios.

In general,
any bond originally offered at a price that is signifi-
cantly below its par value.
P
par value
The nominal or face value of a stock or
bond. The par value of a bond generally represents the
amount of money that the firm borrows and promises
to repay at some future date. The par value of a bond
is often $1,000, but it can be $5,000 or more.
parent company
Another name for a holding
company. A parent company will often have control
over many subsidiaries.
partnership
A partnership exists when two or
more persons associate to conduct a business.
payables deferral period
The average length of
time between a firm’s purchase of materials and labor
and the payment of cash for them. It is calculated by
dividing accounts payable by credit purchases per day
(i.e., cost of goods sold ÷ 365).
payback period
The number of years it takes a
firm to recover its project investment. Payback does
not capture a project’s entire cash flow stream and is
thus not the preferred evaluation method. Note,
however, that the payback does measure a project’s
liquidity, so many firms use it as a risk measure.
payment date
The date on which a firm actually
mails dividend checks.
payment, PMT
Equal to the dollar amount of an
equal or constant cash flow (an annuity).
pegged exchange rates
Rates that are fixed
against a major currency such as the U.S. dollar.
Consequently, the values of the pegged currencies
move together over time.
perfect hedge
A hedge in which the gain or loss
on the hedged transaction exactly offsets the loss or
gain on the unhedged position.
periodic rate, IPER
The rate charged by a lender
or paid by a borrower each period. It can be a rate
per year, per 6-month period, per quarter, per
month, per day, or per any other time interval
(usually 1 year or less).
permanent net operating working capital
The
NOWC required when the economy is weak and
seasonal sales are at their low point. Thus, this level
of NOWC always requires financing and can be
regarded as permanent.
perpetuity
A series of payments of a fixed amount
that continue indefinitely.
physical location exchanges
Exchanges, such as
the New York Stock Exchange, that facilitate trading
of securities at a particular location.
plug technique
Technique used in financial fore-
casting to “plug” in enough new liabilities or assets to
make the balance sheets balance.
poison pills
Shareholder rights provisions that
allow existing shareholders in a company to purchase
additional shares of stock at a lower-than-market
value if a potential acquirer purchases a controlling
stake in the company.
political risk
Refers to the possibility of expropri-
ation and the unanticipated restriction of cash flows
to the parent by a foreign government.
pooling of interests
A method of accounting for a
merger in which the consolidated balance sheet is
Glossary
1103

constructed by simply adding together the balance
sheets of the merged companies. This is no longer
allowed.
portfolio
A group of individual assets held in
combination. An asset that would be relatively risky
if held in isolation may have little or no risk if held in
a well-diversified portfolio.
post-audit
The final aspect of the capital budget-
ing process. The post-audit is a feedback process in
which the actual results are compared with those
predicted in the original capital budgeting analysis.
The post-audit has several purposes, of which the
most important are to improve forecasts and
operations.
precautionary balance
A cash balance held in
reserve for random, unforeseen fluctuations in cash
inflows and outflows.
preemptive right
Gives the current shareholders the
right to purchase any new shares issued in proportion to
their current holdings. The preemptive right enables
current owners to maintain their proportionate share of
ownership and control of the business.
preferred stock
A hybrid security that is similar to
bonds in some respects and to common stock in
other respects. Preferred dividends are similar to
interest payments on bonds in that they are fixed in
amount and generally must be paid before common
stock dividends can be paid. If the preferred dividend
is not earned, the directors can omit it without
throwing the company into bankruptcy.
premium bond
Bond prices and interest rates are
inversely related; that is, they tend to move in the
opposite direction from one another. A fixed-rate bond
will sell at par when its coupon interest rate is equal to
the going rate of interest, rd. When the going rate of
interest is above the coupon rate, a fixed-rate bond will
sell at a “discount” below its par value. If current interest
rates are below the coupon rate, a fixed-rate bond will
sell at a “premium” above its par value.
premium on forward rate
Occurs when the for-
ward exchange rate differs from the spot rate. When
the forward rate is above the spot rate, it is said to be
at a premium.
prepackaged bankruptcy (or pre-pack)
A type of
reorganization that combines the advantages of
informal workouts and formal Chapter 11
reorganization.
price/cash flow ratio
Calculated by dividing price
per share by cash flow per share. This shows how much
investors are willing to pay per dollar of cash flow.
price/earnings (P/E) ratio
Calculated by dividing
price per share by earnings per share. This shows
how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of
reported profits.
price/EBITDA ratio
The ratio of price per share
divided by per share earnings before interest,
depreciation, and amortization.
primary market
Markets in which newly issued
securities are sold for the first time.
priority of claims in liquidation
Established in
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act. It specifies the
order in which the debtor’s assets are distributed
among the creditors.
private markets
Markets in which transactions are
worked out directly between two parties and struc-
tured in any manner that appeals to them. Bank loans
and private placements of debt with insurance com-
panies are examples of private market transactions.
private placement
The sale of stock to only one
or a few investors, usually institutional investors. The
advantages of private placements are lower flotation
costs and greater speed, since the shares issued are
not subject to Securities and Exchange Commission
registration.
probability distribution
A listing, chart, or graph
of all possible outcomes, such as expected rates of
return, with a probability assigned to each outcome.
professional corporation (PC)
Has most of the
benefits of incorporation but the participants are not
relieved of professional (malpractice) liability; known
in some states as a professional association (PA).
profit margin on sales
Calculated by dividing net
income by sales; gives the profit per dollar of sales.
profitability index
Found by dividing the project’s
present value of future cash flows by its initial cost. A
profitability index greater than 1 is equivalent to a
project’s having positive net present value.
profitability ratios
Ratios that show the combined
effects of liquidity, asset management, and debt on
operations.
progressive tax
A tax system in which the higher
one’s income, the larger the percentage paid in taxes.

A business owned by one individual.
prospectus
Summarizes information about a new
security issue and the issuing company.
proxy
A document giving one person the authority
to act for another, typically the power to vote shares
of common stock.
proxy fight
An attempt to take over a company in
which an outside group solicits existing shareholders’
proxies, which are authorizations to vote shares in a
shareholders’ meeting, in an effort to overthrow
management and take control of the business.
public markets
Markets in which standardized
contracts are traded on organized exchanges. Secu-
rities that are issued in public markets, such as com-
mon stock and corporate bonds, are ultimately held
by a large number of individuals.
public offering
An offer of new common stock to
the general public.
publicly owned corporation
Corporation in which
the stock is owned by a large number of investors, most
of whom are not active in management.
purchase accounting
A method of accounting for
a merger in which the merger is handled as a pur-
chase. In this method, the acquiring firm is assumed
to have “bought” the acquired company in much the
same way it would buy any capital asset.
purchasing power parity
Implies that the level of
exchange rates adjusts so that identical goods cost the
same in different countries. Sometimes referred to as
the “law of one price.”
put option
Allows the holder to sell the asset at
some predetermined price within a specified period
of time.
PV
The value today of a future payment, or stream
of payments, discounted at the appropriate rate of
interest. PV is also the beginning amount that will
grow to some future value.
PVAN
The value today of a future stream of N
equal payments at the end of each period (an ordi-
nary annuity).
PVIFAI,N
The present value interest factor for an
ordinary annuity of N periodic payments discounted
at I percent interest per period.
PVIFI,N
The present value interest factor for a
lump sum received N periods in the future dis-
counted at I percent per period.
Q
quick, or acid test, ratio
Found by taking current
assets less inventories and then dividing by current
liabilities.
R
real options
Occur when managers can influence
the size and risk of a project’s cash flows by taking
different actions during the project’s life. They are
referred to as real options because they deal with real
as opposed to financial assets. They are also called
managerial options because they give opportunities
to managers to respond to changing market condi-
tions. Sometimes they are called strategic options
because they often deal with strategic issues. Finally,
they are also called embedded options because they
are a part of another project.
real rate of return, rr
Contains no adjustment for
expected inflation. If net cash flows from a project do
not include inflation adjustments, then the cash flows
should be discounted at the real cost of capital. In a
similar manner, the internal rate of return resulting
from real net cash flows should be compared with
the real cost of capital.
real risk-free rate of interest, r*
The interest rate
on a risk-free security in an economy with zero in-
flation. The real risk-free rate could also be called
the pure rate of interest since it is the rate of interest
that would exist on very short-term, default-free U.S.
Glossary
1105

Treasury securities if the expected rate of inflation
were zero.
realized rate of return, r-
The actual return an
investor receives on his or her investment. It can
be quite different than the expected return.

cash. It is calculated by dividing accounts receivable
by sales per day.
red herring (preliminary) prospectus
A prelimi-
nary prospectus that may be distributed to potential
buyers prior to approval of the registration statement
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. After
the registration has become effective, the securities—
accompanied by the prospectus—may be offered
for sale.
redeemable bond
Gives investors the right to sell
the bonds back to the corporation at a price that is
usually close to the par value. If interest rates rise,
then investors can redeem the bonds and reinvest at
the higher rates.
refunding
Occurs when a company issues debt at
current low rates and uses the proceeds to repurchase
one of its existing high–coupon rate debt issues.
Often these are callable issues, which means the
company can purchase the debt at a call price lower
than the market price.
registration statement
Required by the Securities
and Exchange Commission before a company’s
securities can be offered to the public. This state-
ment is used to summarize various financial and legal
information about the company.
reinvestment rate risk
Occurs when a short-term
debt security must be “rolled over.” If interest rates
have fallen then the reinvestment of principal will be
at a lower rate, with correspondingly lower interest
payments and ending value.
relative priority doctrine
More flexible than
absolute priority. Gives a more balanced consider-
ation to all claimants in a bankruptcy reorganization
than does the absolute priority doctrine.
relaxed net operating working capital policy
A
policy under which relatively large amounts of cash,
marketable securities, and inventories are carried and
under which sales are stimulated by a liberal credit
policy, resulting in a high level of receivables.
reorganization in bankruptcy
A court-approved
attempt to keep a company alive by changing its
capital structure in lieu of liquidation. A reorganiza-
tion must adhere to the standards of fairness and
feasibility.
repatriation of earnings
The cash flow, usually in
the form of dividends or royalties, from the foreign
branch or subsidiary to the parent company. These
cash flows must be converted to the currency of the
parent and thus are subject to future exchange rate
changes. A foreign government may restrict the
amount of cash that may be repatriated.
replacement chain (common life) approach
A
method of comparing mutually exclusive projects that
have unequal lives. Each project is replicated so that
they will both terminate in a common year. If projects
with lives of 3 years and 5 years are being evaluated,
then the 3-year project would be replicated 5 times
and the 5-year project replicated 3 times; thus, both
projects would terminate in 15 years.
required rate of return, rs
The minimum
acceptable rate of return, considering both its risk
and the returns available on other investments.
reserve borrowing capacity
Exists when a firm
uses less debt under “normal” conditions than called
for by the trade-off theory. This allows the firm
some flexibility to use debt in the future when addi-
tional capital is needed.
residual distribution model
In this model, firms
should pay dividends only when more earnings are
available than needed to support the optimal capital
budget.
residual value
The market value of the leased
property at the expiration of the lease. The estimate
of the residual value is one of the key elements in
lease analysis.
restricted net operating working capital policy
A policy under which holdings of cash, securities,
inventories, and receivables are minimized.
restricted voting rights
A provision that auto-
matically deprives a shareholder of voting rights if
the shareholder owns more than a specified amount
of stock.
retained earnings
The portion of the firm’s earn-
ing that have been saved rather than paid out as
dividends.

Occurs when the relative price of a
currency is increased. It is the opposite of
devaluation.
reverse split
Situation in which shareholders
exchange a particular number of shares of stock for
a smaller number of new shares.
revolving credit agreement
A formal, committed
line of credit extended by a bank or other lending
institution.
rights offering
Occurs when a corporation sells a
new issue of common stock to its existing stock-
holders. Each stockholder receives a certificate,
called a stock purchase right, giving the stockholder
the option to purchase a specified number of the
new shares. The rights are issued in proportion
to the amount of stock that each shareholder
currently owns.
risk arbitrage
The practice of purchasing stock in
companies (in the context of mergers) that may
become takeover targets.
risk aversion
A risk-averse investor dislikes risk
and requires a higher rate of return as an inducement
to buy riskier securities.
risk premium for Stock i, RPi
The extra return
that an investor requires to hold risky Stock i instead
of a risk-free asset.
risk-adjusted discount rate
Incorporates the risk
of the project’s cash flows. The cost of capital to
the firm reflects the average risk of the firm’s
existing projects. Thus, new projects that are
riskier than existing projects should have a higher
risk-adjusted discount rate. Conversely, projects
with less risk should have a lower risk-adjusted
discount rate.
roadshow
Before an IPO, the senior management
team and the investment banker make presentations
to potential investors. They make three to five pre-
sentations daily over a 2-week period in 10 to 20
cities.

Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, elects to
be taxed as a proprietorship or a partnership yet
retains limited liability and other benefits of the

A type of financial lease in
which the firm owning the property sells it to
another firm, often a financial institution, while
simultaneously entering into an agreement to lease
the property back from the firm.
salvage value
The market value of an asset after its
useful life.
scenario analysis
A shorter version of simulation
analysis that uses only a few outcomes. Often the
outcomes are for three scenarios: optimistic, pessi-
mistic, and most likely.
seasonal effects on ratios
Seasonal factors can
distort ratio analysis. At certain times of the year, a
firm may have excessive inventories in preparation of
a “season” of high demand. Therefore, an inventory
turnover ratio taken at this time will be radically
different than one taken after the season.
secondary market
Markets in which securities are
resold after initial issue in the primary market. The
New York Stock Exchange is an example.
secured loan
A loan backed by collateral, which is
often in the form of inventories or receivables.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
A
government agency which regulates the sales of new
securities and the operations of securities exchanges.
The SEC, along with other government agencies and
self-regulation, helps ensure stable markets, sound
brokerage firms, and the absence of stock
manipulation.
securitization
The process whereby financial
instruments that were previously thinly traded are
converted to a form that creates greater liquidity.
Securitization also applies to the situation where
specific assets are pledged as collateral for securities,
thus creating asset-backed securities. One example
of the former is junk bonds; an example of the latter
is mortgage-backed securities.
Security Market Line (SML)
Represents, in a
graphical form, the relationship between the risk of
an asset as measured by its beta and the required
Glossary

rates of return for individual securities. The SML
equation is one of the key results of the CAPM:
ri = rRF + bi(rM −rRF).
semistrong form of market efficiency
States that
current market prices reflect all publicly available
information. Therefore, the only way to gain ab-
normal returns on a stock is to possess inside infor-
mation about the company’s stock.
sensitivity analysis
Indicates exactly how much
net present value will change in response to a given
change in an input variable, other things held con-
stant. Sensitivity analysis is sometimes called “what
if” analysis because it answers this type of question.
shareholder rights provision
Also known as a
poison pill, it allows existing shareholders to pur-
chase additional shares of stock at a price that is
lower than the market value if a potential acquirer
purchases a controlling stake in the company.
shelf registration
Frequently, companies will file a
master registration statement and then update it with
a short-form statement just before an offering. This
procedure is termed shelf registration because com-
panies put new securities “on the shelf” and then
later sell them when the market is right.
short hedges
Occur when futures contracts are
sold to guard against price declines.
simple interest
The situation when interest is not
compounded; that is, interest is not earned on in-
terest. Also called regular interest. Divide the nomi-
nal interest rate by 365 and multiply by the number
of days the funds are borrowed to find the interest
for the term borrowed.
sinking fund
Facilitates the orderly retirement of a
bond issue. This can be achieved in one of two ways:
(1) the company can call in for redemption (at par
value) a certain percentage of bonds each year; or
(2) the company may buy the required amount of
bonds on the open market.
soft currencies
Currencies of countries that set
the exchange rate but do not allow their currencies to
be traded on world markets.
speculative balances
Funds held by a firm in
order to have cash for taking advantage of bargain
purchases or growth opportunities.
spin-off
Occurs when a holding company distri-
butes the stock of one of the operating companies to
its shareholders, thus passing control from the
holding company to the shareholders directly.
spontaneously generated funds
Funds generated
if a liability account increases spontaneously (auto-
matically) as sales increase. An increase in a liability
account is a source of funds, thus funds have been
generated. Two examples of spontaneous liability
accounts are accounts payable and accrued wages.
Notes payable, although a current liability account,
is not a spontaneous source of funds because an
increase in notes payable requires a specific action
between the firm and a creditor.
spot rate
The exchange rate that applies to “on the
spot” trades or, more precisely, to exchanges that
occur two days following the day of trade (in other
words, current exchanges).
spread
The difference between the price at which
an underwriter sells the stock in an initial public
offering and the proceeds that the underwriter passes
on to the issuing firm; the fee collected by the
underwriter. It is often about 7% of the offering price.
stand-alone risk
The risk an investor takes by
holding only one asset.
standard deviation, σ
A statistical measure of the
variability of a set of observations. It is the square
root of the variance.

Reports the impact of a
firm’s operating, investing, and financing activities
on cash flows over an accounting period.
statement of stockholders’ equity
Statement
showing the beginning stockholders’ equity, any
changes due to stock issues/repurchases, the amount
of net income that is retained, and the ending

stepped-up strike (or exercise) price
A provision
in a warrant that increases the strike price over time.
This provision is included to encourage owners to
exercise their warrants.
stock dividend
Increases the number of shares
outstanding but at a slower rate than splits. Current
shareholders receive additional shares on some pro-
portional basis. Thus, a holder of 100 shares would
receive 5 additional shares at no cost if a 5% stock
dividend were declared.
stock option
Allows its owner to purchase a share
of stock at a fixed price, called the strike price or the
1108

exercise price, no matter what the actual price of the
stock is. Stock options always have an expiration
date, after which they cannot be exercised.
stock repurchase
Occurs when a firm repurchases
its own stock. These shares of stock are then referred
to as treasury stock.
stock split
Current shareholders are given some
number (or fraction) of shares for each stock share
owned. Thus, in a 3-for-1 split, each shareholder
would receive three new shares in exchange for each
old share, thereby tripling the number of shares
outstanding. Stock splits usually occur when the
stock price is outside of the optimal trading range.
strategic options
Options that often deal with
strategic issues. Also called real options, embedded
options, and managerial options.
stretching accounts payable
The practice of
deliberately paying accounts late.
strike (or exercise) price
The price stated in the
option contract at which the security can be bought
(or sold).
strong form of market efficiency
Assumes that all
information pertaining to a stock, whether public or
inside information, is reflected in current market
prices. Thus, no investors would be able to earn
abnormal returns in the stock market.
structured note
A debt obligation derived from
another debt obligation. Permits a partitioning of
risks to give investors what they want.
subordinated debenture
Debentures that have
claims on assets, in the event of bankruptcy, only
after senior debt (as named in the subordinated
debt’s indenture) has been paid off. Subordinated
debentures may be subordinated to designated notes
payable or to all other debt.
sunk cost
A cost that has already occurred and is
not affected by the capital project decision. Sunk
costs are not relevant to capital budgeting decisions.
swap
An exchange of cash payment obligations.
Usually occurs because the parties involved prefer
someone else’s payment pattern or type.
sweetener
A feature that makes a security more
attractive to some investors, thereby inducing them
to accept a lower current yield. Convertible features
and warrants are examples of sweeteners.
synchronization of cash flows
Occurs when firms
are able to time cash receipts to coincide with cash
requirements.
synergy
Occurs when the whole is greater than the
sum of its parts. When applied to mergers, a syner-
gistic merger occurs when the post-merger earnings
exceed the sum of the separate companies’ pre-
merger earnings.
T
takeover
An action whereby a person or group
succeeds in ousting a firm’s management and taking
control of the company.
target capital structure
The relative amount of
debt, preferred stock, and common equity that the
firm desires. The weighted average cost of capital
should be based on these target weights.
target cash balance
The desired cash balance that
a firm plans to maintain in order to conduct business.
target company
A firm that another company
seeks to acquire.
target distribution ratio
Percentage of net
income distributed to shareholders through cash
dividends or stock repurchases.
target payout ratio
Percentage of net income paid
as a cash dividend.
targeted share repurchases
Also known as
greenmail, occurs when a company buys back stock
from a potential acquirer at a price that is higher
than the market price. In return, the potential
acquirer agrees not to attempt to take over the
company.
tax loss carryback and carryforward
Ordinary
corporate operating losses can be carried backward
for 2 years or forward for 20 years to offset taxable
income in a given year.
tax preference theory
Proposes that investors
prefer capital gains over dividends, because capital
gains taxes can be deferred into the future but taxes
on dividends must be paid as the dividends are
received.
taxable income
Gross income less a set of
exemptions and deductions that are spelled out in the
instructions to the tax forms that individuals must
file.
Glossary

technical analysts
Stock analysts who believe that
past trends or patterns in stock prices can be used to
predict future stock prices.
temporary net operating working capital
The
NOWC required above the permanent level when
the economy is strong and/or seasonal sales are high.
tender offer
The offer of one firm to buy the stock
of another by going directly to the stockholders,
frequently over the opposition of the target com-
pany’s management.
term structure of interest rates
The relationship
between yield to maturity and term to maturity for
bonds of a single risk class.
terminal value
Value of operations at the end of
the explicit forecast period; equal to the present value
of all free cash flows beyond the forecast period,
discounted back to the end of the forecast period at
the weighted average cost of capital.
time line
A graphical representation used to show
the timing of cash flows.
times-interest-earned (TIE) ratio
Determined
by dividing earnings before interest and taxes by the
interest charges. This ratio measures the extent to
which operating income can decline before the firm
is unable to meet its annual interest costs.
total assets turnover ratio
Measures the turnover
of all the firm’s assets; it is calculated by dividing
sales by total assets.
trade credit
Debt arising from credit sales and
recorded as an account receivable by the seller and as
an account payable by the buyer.
trade deficit
Occurs when a country imports more
goods from abroad than it exports.
trade discounts
Price reductions that suppliers
offer customers for early payment of bills.
trade-off model
The addition of financial dis-
tress and agency costs to either the MM tax model
or the Miller model. In this model, the optimal
capital structure can be visualized as a trade-off
between the benefit of debt (the interest tax shel-
ter) and the costs of debt (financial distress and
agency costs).
transactions balance
The cash balance associated
with payments and collections; the balance necessary
for day-to-day operations.
Treasury bond
Bonds issued by the federal gov-
ernment; sometimes called T-bonds or government
bonds. Treasury bonds have no default risk.
trend analysis
An analysis of a firm’s financial
ratios over time. It is used to estimate the likelihood
of improvement or deterioration in its financial
situation.
U
underinvestment problem
A type of agency
problem in which high debt can cause managers
to forgo positive NPV projects unless they are
extremely safe.
underwritten arrangement
Contract between a
firm and an investment banker when stock is issued.
An investment banker agrees to buy the entire issue
at a set price and then resells the stock at the offering
price. Thus, the risk of selling the issue rests with the
investment banker.
V
value drivers
The four value drivers are the
growth rate in sales (g), operating profitability (OP =
NOPAT/Sales), capital requirements (CR = Capital/
Sales), and the weighted average cost of capital
(WACC).
value of operations (Vop)
The present value of all
expected future free cash flows when discounted at
the weighted average cost of capital.
value-based management
Managing a firm with
shareholder value in mind. It typically involves use of
a model of shareholder value, such as the corporate
value model.
variance, σ2
A measure of the distribution’s vari-
ability. It is the sum of the squared deviations about
the expected value.
venture capitalist
The manager of a venture cap-
ital fund. The fund raises most of its capital from
institutional investors and invests in start-up com-
panies in exchange for equity.
vertical merger
Occurs when a company acquires
another firm that is “upstream” or “downstream”; for
example, an automobile manufacturer acquires a steel
producer.
vesting period
Period during which employee
stock options cannot be exercised.
1110
Glossary

W
warrant
A call option, issued by a company, that
allows the holder to buy a stated number of shares of
stock from the company at a specified price. War-
rants are generally distributed with debt, or preferred
stock, to induce investors to buy those securities at
lower cost.
weak form of market efficiency
Assumes that all
information contained in past price movements is
fully reflected in current market prices. Thus, infor-
mation about recent trends in a stock’s price is of no
use in selecting a stock.
weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
The
weighted average of the after-tax component costs of
capital—debt, preferred stock, and common equity.
Each weighting factor is the proportion of that type
of capital in the optimal, or target, capital structure.
white knight
A friendly competing bidder that a
target management likes better than the company
making a hostile offer; the target solicits a merger
with the white knight as a preferable alternative.
window dressing
Techniques employed by firms
to make their financial statements look better than
they really are.
working capital
A firm’s investment in short-term
assets—cash, marketable securities, inventory, and
accounts receivable.
workout
Voluntary reorganization plans arranged
between creditors and generally sound companies
experiencing temporary financial difficulties. Work-
outs typically require some restructuring of the
firm’s debt.
Y
Yankee bonds
Bond issued by a foreign borrower
denominated in dollars and sold in the United States
under SEC regulations
yield curve
The curve that results when yield to
maturity is plotted on the y-axis with term to matu-
rity on the x-axis.
yield to call (YTC)
The rate of interest earned on
a bond if it is called. If current interest rates are well
below an outstanding callable bond’s coupon rate,
then the YTC may be a more relevant estimate of
expected return than the YTM because the bond is
likely to be called.
yield to maturity (YTM)
The rate of interest
earned on a bond if it is held to maturity.
Z
zero coupon bond
Pays no coupons at all but is
offered at a substantial discount below its par value
and hence provides capital appreciation rather than
interest income.
