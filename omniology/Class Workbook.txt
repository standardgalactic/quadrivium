MEET SHEILA
In hindsight, Sheila E. seems fated to 
have become the Queen of Percussion, but 
as grateful as she is for the incredible career 
she’s had thus far, none of this was handed to 
her. Yes, she was born into a legendary mu­
sic family—her father, Pete Escovedo, and his 
brother Coke were in Santana before launch­
ing Azteca, their own groovy Latin rock or­
chestra—but money was scarce growing up 
in Oakland, California, in the ’60s. Music, 
however, was abundant. 
Sheila Cecelia Escovedo’s love for complex 
rhythms and diverse sounds developed natu­
rally at a young age. Her godfather, Tito Pu­
ente, was one of the many music celebrities 
who’d come over to the house for living room 
jams—as soon as the sessions cleared out, 
she’d head right for the drums. And beyond 
her front door, the Bay Area was teeming 
with thrilling young acts: everyone 
from the Grateful Dead 
to the Pointer Sisters 
to Sly & the Family 
Stone.
Though her 
dad hoped 
she’d pursue 
a more stable 
path, he couldn’t 
deny Sheila’s talent 
or her will—by age 15, 
she’d worn him down and got her first live gig 
filling in on congas for an under-the-weath­
er Azteca member. From that point on, there 
was no stopping her. By her early 20s, Sheila 
had played with Marvin Gaye, Lionel Richie, 
Herbie Hancock, and Diana Ross, plus she’d 
become a percussionist and singer (live and 
studio) in George Duke’s band.
In 1984, Sheila became a megastar after 
joining Prince for his Purple Rain sessions. She 
not only sang on the hook for “Erotic City” 
but also dropped her own Grammy-nom­
inated hit, “The Glamorous Life,” from her 
debut album of the same name. More solo 
albums and singles followed—including her 
1985 signature song, “A Love Bizarre”—even 
as Sheila held down the roles of music direc­
tor, drummer, and songwriter in Prince’s tour­
ing band and recording family. 
That multidisciplinary approach is a 
Sheila staple. As beloved as she would be­
come for her incredible onstage verve, funky 
genre-blurring jams, playful persona, and 
wild fashion sense, Sheila never stopped

collaborating, never stopped working, and 
never stopped learning. Her body of work has 
grown to include eight solo albums, a couple 
of side groups (C.O.E.D. and the E Family), a 
few film scores, a 2014 autobiography titled 
The Beat of My Own Drum, special perfor­
mances at virtually every major awards show, 
and studio collaborations with everyone 
from Beyoncé to Phil 
Collins. Oh, and she’s 
thrice been a member 
of Ringo Starr’s All-
Starr Band.
In truth, that list 
only scratches the 
surface—for instance, 
Sheila has a steamy 
new single out with Snoop Dogg called “No 
Line”—but it’d be impossible to fit her career 
into a tidy narrative. Sheila fought the road­
block of industry misogyny, the wages of 
fame, and the physical limits of her own body 
to carve out a unique path through art, life, 
and pop culture. One constant, in the form 
of a simple phrase, has driven Sheila every 
step of the way: Follow the beat. And her im­
peccable inner rhythm is the pulse behind a 
trailblazing career that still knows no bounds.

with a little independent study. Pull up the songs in this 
chapter’s playlist. Listen not just with your ears but your 
body. Dance or tap along to the rhythms you hear. Pay 
close attention to any patterns you might notice. If you 
try to count to the beat, what happens? Can you pick out 
different percussion sounds? How would you describe those 
sounds to someone who isn’t listening to the same song? In 
a notebook, jot down the ways that different types of rhythm 
change the feel of the music overall.

Rhythm is virtually universal to the human 
experience. Strictly speaking, according to 
Merriam-Webster, rhythm is “an ordered 
recurrent alternation of strong and weak 
elements in the flow of sound and silence.” 
But rhythm was with us before we had words 
with which to define it. As Sheila points out, 
our heartbeat is a rhythm—the first rhythm—
as is the pace of our walk, the lilt of our sway, 
and the movement of our dance. As people 
have evolved, we’ve carried rhythm with us 
and baked it into our technology. The tick­
tock of a clock is an obvious example, but 
consider the ka-thump of a spinning wash­
ing machine, the click-click-click of an as­
cending roller coaster, or, well, whatever that 
sound is that a Xerox machine makes.
BRING THE BEAT IN
IN MUSIC, RHYTHM 
BREAKS DOWN INTO 
FOUR BASIC PARTS: 
There’s accent, which is what happens 
when one note is given more emphasis 
than the others. For instance, if you drum 
on your desk or legs as you’re reading 
this, you can create an accent by regular­

       YOUR 
RHYTHM

ly bringing one hand down 
harder than the other. 
Then there’s measure, also 
known as a bar, which we’ll 
define as a grouping of beats. 
The number of beats per 
measure is determined by the 
meter (see below). 
Meter is the rhythmic pattern determined 
by the number of beats you hit per measure. 
This is why you see a time signature, or a 
meter signature, at the beginning of a piece 
of Western music. The time signature is typ­
ically represented by two stacked numbers, 
like, where the top number is the number of 
beats in a measure and the bottom number 
is the note value that represents one beat. 
(For example, a song written in 4/4 time will 
have four quarter-note beats per measure, 
whereas a song written in 9/8 time will have 
nine eighth-note beats per measure.) 
  
And finally, there’s tempo, or the speed 
of the rhythm. The goal in most music is 
to maintain a consistent tempo over the 
course of a song, but you can experiment 
with yours by speeding up and slowing 
down your hands as you drum in your seat. 
You don’t need an instrument to create 
rhythm. As Sheila puts it, “Rhythm is some­
thing everyone has, whether you’re aware of 
it or not.” It’s literally at your fingertips.
> If you peruse the chapter playlist and accompany­
ing map (see pages 5 and 6), you’ll hear a  world’s 
worth of rhythms. Let’s dial it back to something 
more simple. As Sheila suggests, get some sort of 
METRONOME—a physical or virtual device that will 
keep time for you at a tempo of your choosing and 
often allow you to experience different meters (or time 
signatures). You can find the simplest version of this 
by typing “metronome” into Google and using the 
browser’s free tool. There are also apps available for 
your smartphone, and Amazon sells many analog and 
digital versions. Start by setting your metronome at 
a MID-TEMPO speed: 80 to 100 bpm, or BEATS PER 
MINUTE. The metronome will play a CLICK TRACK at 
a steady pace. 
Paying close attention to that click track, spend at 
least five minutes drumming along using whatever 
you have—hands, pens, sticks—on any surface: your 
legs, a desk, an actual drum. Start by simply mimick­
ing the track beat for beat. Try this with both a DOWN 
TEMPO (below 80 bpm) and UP TEMPO (above 120 
bpm) speed. When you find a tempo that’s comfort­
able, see what happens when you introduce an accent 
on every second beat. You can even try hitting a beat 
between the clicks. Just make sure that you stay IN 
TIME—that you keep with the tempo.
“Music is in my 
blood because 
of how  
I grew up, but 
anyone can  
find rhythm.”

 20 FASCINATING GLOBAL RHYTHMS 
> Different rhythms arise in different cultures, defining 
genres and influencing one another. Take a spin through 
this playlist to hear just a few of the rhythms used in music 
around the world. In many cases, the type of rhythm is 
synonymous with the genre of music associated with that 
rhythm (cha-cha-chá, for instance) and in some cases 
it’s synonymous with the instrument used to create it (like 
gamelan). It’s worth noting that the presence of rhythm 
doesn’t require a form of percussion (as evidenced in the 
waltz on this playlist), but the use of percussion helps punc­
tuate and clarify, and it often adds complexity to the rhythm 
of a song. You may notice similarities in rhythms that are 
geographically distant—the Afro-Cuban clave pattern 
pops up frequently—and that’s no coincidence. Rhythm is 
something that all of humanity shares, and it’s an integral 
part of the ongoing conversation that is musical creation.

CREATING A 
KITCHEN SYMPHONY
As you now know, you don’t need to rush 
off to an instrument shop to find rhythm—it’s 
already in your heart and hands. But Sheila 
takes that one step further: You don’t have 
to buy instruments at all in order to have, 
well, instruments—they’re all around you 
if you know where to 
look (consider the 
drummers you often 
see on city streets who 
play on buckets).  
Sheila suggests that 
you start in the kitch­
en. It’s common for 
children to drum on 
pots and pans. Sheila 
did it before she was big enough to get on a 
drum kit. But it’s also quite common for es­
tablished artists to use such everyday sounds 
as sources of rhythm within their music. The 
Beach Boys famously had Paul McCartney 
crunch on celery for a recording of “Vega-Ta­
bles,” and Sheila played partially filled glass 
bottles on Michael Jackson’s “Don’t Stop ’Til 
You Get Enough.”
The first drums were made using the 
household items of their time: animal hides, 
hollowed-out gourds or pieces of wood, 
sticks, stones, clay. Today, of course, our 
homes are filled with a wide array of sophis­
ticated items, but the same old principles can 
be applied to these new things to turn them 
into instruments. You watched Sheila create 
an entire song on the spot using a handful 
of common objects, from a jar filled with rice 
and beans to a power drill.
Recording these experiments isn’t much 
more difficult than creating the instruments. 
In the past, artists would need to go into a 
studio or buy special gear in order to track 
their songs, which means recording multi­
ple layers of audio (different instruments, 
for instance) that are combined to form a 
single piece of music. Today, there are many 
“THERE ARE NO RULES 
TO SAY THIS IS 
RIGHT OR WRONG, 
AND THAT’S WHAT’S 
FUN ABOUT IT.”
> Make three or more DIY percussion instruments of 
your own using things around your home that you 
can shake, hit, play, or easily modify. (Bonus points if 
you create an instrument that doesn’t already appear 
here.) Once you’ve done this, access a program that 
allows you to record multiple tracks and, as outlined 
above or in the program’s instructions, create a loop. 
We’ll get technical later. For now, as Sheila says, “the 
point is just to have fun!”

digital audio workstations (DAW) that 
range from free (like Apple’s GarageBand) 
to quite expensive (like Pro Tools), as well 
as apps that allow you to capture audio 
and loop it, or play it on repeat, using your 
smartphone or computer. 
The exact method differs from program to 
program, but this is the general approach:
Start by playing a click track in your ear 
using headphones or earbuds—you don’t 
want to record the sound of the metro­
nome.
Choose an instrument and record your 
first rhythm track for some length of time—
at least 30 seconds so you’ve got room to 
find your beat.
Using the program, isolate a loopable 
section of that first rhythm (one or more 
full measures). Some programs will find 
this automatically.
Play a loop of your first rhythm track in 
your ear. When you’re ready, hit record 
and play your next instrument. This will be 
your second track.
Play the first and second tracks together 
at the same time in your ear as you make 
a third track. Repeat as many times as 
you’d like.

GETTING 
WARMED UP
Warming up properly is serious business. 
And now that you’ve got rhythm down, you’ll 
be warming up in two ways: First, as you 
progress on your journey deeper into rhythm, 
you are warming up by learning fundamen­
tals that will prepare you for the instruments 
introduced later on. And second, like an ath­
lete, you should spend some time warming 
up every time before actually playing. 
Conveniently, drum rudiments are the 
solution in both cases. A rudiment is any of a 
series of basic patterns that can later be com­
bined to create a more complex pattern. Be­
ginners use rudiments to improve their speed 
and control, and pros use them to stay sharp. 
Sheila, for instance, does rudimental drills to 
ensure both of her hands sound alike—that 
left and right are hitting with equal force and 
accuracy—by the time she sits down at the 
actual drum set.

GO FROM DRUM ZERO 
TO DRUM HERO WITH 
THE POWER OF RUDIMENTS
Regular practice is the not-so-secret secret 
to getting good. Rudiments help you:
Get your hands used to holding 
the drumsticks
Foster discipline by allowing for 
daily practice
Train your muscles so your hands 
sound alike
Improve your aim as playing 
becomes natural
Increase your speed as you 
gain confidence
Build up to more complex rudiments 
and rhythms
Warm up for the big gig, because 
now you’re a pro
Rudiments require drumsticks, but that’s 
about it. You can practice them on the floor, 
a table, a pillow, a bucket, a practice pad, 
or an actual drum. Here are four common 
rudiments: 
Single-stroke roll: Repeatedly alternate 
right (R) and left (L) in time with the beat.
Double-stroke roll: Play two single 
strokes on each hand (RRLL). Repeat.
Paradiddle: Play two single strokes 
followed by a double stroke (RLRR 
or LRLL). 
Flam: Two single strokes on alternating 
hands that are played almost simultane­
ously. The first stroke should be quieter 
(a grace note), and the second should 
be louder and on the beat.
> Spend 20 minutes practicing the above rudiments to a 
metronome. Sheila suggests doing at least that much every 
time you’re scheduled to record or perform. That said, and 
especially if you’re new to the drumsticks, you should aim for 
a minimum of 30 minutes per day, every day, of rudimental 
drills (whether or not anyone will hear you play).

MEET THE DRUMS 
You’ve seen Sheila’s drum set—not the one 
she uses during her class but the various kits 
that show up in the archival footage. She had 
cymbals and drums everywhere—above her 
head, behind her back, surrounding her on 
all sides. As she says with a glint in her eye, “I 
wanted to be a rock ‘n’ roll drummer.” There’s 
no doubt that Sheila became, and still is, a 
bona fide rock star, but it’s important to re­
member she built up to that. If you’re new to 
the kit, ease into it.
You can do plenty with a hi-hat, a kick, and 
a snare—what Sheila refers to as the foun­
dation of playing drums—but the standard 
modern kit is what’s called a five-piece. A 
five-piece will actually have more parts than 
five parts, but in categorizing the type of kit, 
you only count the actual drums.
Here are the standard components of a 
five-piece drum kit:
Bass drum: Also known as the kick, this 
large vertical drum sits front and center, is 
played using a beater operated by pedal, 
and is the foundation of the rhythm.
SURROUND SOUND
A young Sheila shows off an im­
pressive  kit during a live demo. 
“YOU’RE BUILDING CHARACTER—
YOU’RE BUILDING WHO YOU WANT 
TO SOUND LIKE.”

1414
Snare drum: This smaller drum is mount­
ed on a stand between your knees. It has 
wires beneath the head that vibrate, giving 
it a steady rhythm character and verve.
Tom-tom drums: These drums are used 
for solos and fills, and you’ll have three—
two small rack toms mounted to the top 
of the bass drum and one large floor tom.
Hi-hat: Two small cymbals, generally 
used for keeping time, which are mount­
ed, facing each other, on a stand. The 
cymbals are opened and closed with a 
pedal and/or played with sticks.
Ride cymbal: A large cymbal that has a 
long sustain, meaning it resonates for a 
good length of time after being hit. It’s typi­
cally used for constant rhythm patterns.
Crash cymbal: A medium-size cymbal 
named for the loud and sharp sound it 
makes when struck. It’s primarily used for 
occasional accents.
Hardware: This refers to all of the 
stands, holders, and racks that lift the 
components of the kit off of the ground, 
including you—your drum stool, or 
throne, is hardware, too.
Common additions to a drum kit include 
cowbells, clave blocks, and tambourines, but 
there’s no limit to the size of kit that you can 
build if you’ve got enough money, imagination, 
and chops. Neil Peart, legendary drummer for 
the prog-rock band Rush, was known to play 
kits with as many as 40 different sound-mak­
ing components, including, at various times, 
about a dozen cymbals, eight toms, two kicks, 
chimes, gongs, and various electronics, not to 
mention gold-plated hardware.
But no matter your means or experience, 
mastering your kit doesn’t mean adding a 
ton of (literal) bells and whistles. It’s all about 
keeping time and finding a groove. Some of 
the most memorable drum performances 
of all time are remarkably simple (see this 
chapter’s playlist).
> Sheila suggests starting out with a simple 2/4 beat 
that utilizes just the hi-hat, snare, and kick. With a 
metronome going, count off the beat: 1, 2, 3, 4/1, 2, 
3, 4/1, 2, 3, 4 repeating. Use a stick to hit the hi-hat 
on every beat. Once you’re steady, add the snare 
on the 2 and the 4. When you are comfortable, add 
the kick on the 1 and the 3. Says Sheila: “I dare you 
to play that beat...for, like, five minutes straight.... 
If you have a [full] drum set, don’t touch anything 
else. Just practice that 2 and 4 [until] it sounds so 
amazing, it sounds even, it sounds smooth.” Do just 
that. Run a stopwatch and don’t pause until you’ve 
played in time for five minutes straight. After that, 
add the kick drum to every beat. That’s called 4/4 
or FOUR-ON-THE-FLOOR. How did the energy 
change? What kind of genres would sound good 
with that kind of persistent beat?

of a crowd—at the age of five. That per­
formance, with her dad and his brothers 
in Oakland, was just for fun, but 10 years 
later she made her professional live debut 
with Azteca. She begged her father to let 
her fill in for a sick band member, and with 
a little coaxing from mom 
he agreed. When she took 
her first conga solo in front 
of a roaring audience, 
Sheila had an out-of-body 
experience. Backstage, 
she told her dad: “This is 
what I want to do for the 
rest of my life.”
The conga was invented in Cuba, but its 
roots are in Africa. As Sheila points out, con­
gas are essential timekeepers in various forms 
of Latin music (salsa, merengue, bossa nova, 
etc.), though they’ve found a home in count­
less genres, from pop, rock, and folk to jazz, 
soul, and funk. In broad terms, there are three 
types of congas: The quinto is the smallest 
and thus highest pitched. The tumba is 
the largest and lowest pitched. In the middle 
is the tres dos, tres golpes, or segundo, though 
this drum is most commonly simply called 
the conga. 
Sheila learned the congas by watching 
and mirroring her dad’s motions—that’s why 
she plays left-handed to this day despite be­
ing a righty. Now you can learn while mirror­
ing her (and wind up right-handed). While 
there are variations in technique, there are 
five basic ways of hitting the conga:
Slap: Strike near the center of the drum 
with the flats of your fingertips while keep­
ing your hand somewhat cupped in order 
to create extra resonance.
Bass: Strike near the center of the drum 
with the full palm of your hand.
Open: Strike near the rim of the drum with 
the base of all four fingers (near where the 
fingers meet the palm) and let your hand 
quickly bounce back up.
“DON’T BE AFRAID 
TO MOVE—
IT ACTUALLY MAKES 
YOU SOUND 
BETTER!”

Muted: Do an open strike, but leave your 
fingers on the drum to muffle the sound.
Heel-toe: Strike the drum toward the cen­
ter with the heel of your palm, then follow 
with your fingertips—there are two strikes, 
but they’re part of one motion.

THE CONGA BUYING FAQ
How many should I get?
Up to you. Two congas of different sizes will 
allow you to develop an ear for pitch and 
tone more quickly, but one conga has plenty 
to offer via differing strikes and patterns.
Can I buy them used?
Absolutely. Just check the seller’s online 
reviews if applicable. Look for cracks, 
rust, or stuck tuning bolts on the drum,
 and prioritize getting one that has a 
new drumhead.
What size do I want?
If you’re buying one, start with the middle 
size. It is the most versatile in that it provides 
a rich bass tone and sharp high notes, so it 
can be used for keeping time or soloing.
Fiberglass or wood?
Wooden congas (especially oak and ash) 
produce the best sound, but fiberglass is 
considerably less expensive and perfectly 
acceptable for learning and at-home use.
Do I need a stand?
Nope. A stand or rack is needed if you’re 
going to play the congas while standing, 
which allows you to strike harder and loud­
er, but it’s easiest to learn while sitting.

and try the cha-cha-chá rhythm that Sheila demon­
strates: open, open, slap on your dominant hand, 
while your “floating hand” adds a heel-toe between 
the open and slap. Experiment with dynamics—hit 
harder or softer and pay attention to how this affects 
your ability to keep time. When you’ve mastered the 
basic rhythm, up the tempo and go again. Do the 
same with the other rhythm patterns at the end of 
this chapter. As Sheila says, “Really dig deep and be 
serious about your practice.”

“DO IT WITH 
PASSION AND 
REALLY MEAN WHAT 
YOU’RE PLAYING.”
With a crisp, resonant sound and a tropical 
feel—they are from Cuba, after all—the tim­
bales bring a lot to a band setting despite their 
relatively simple setup. Pete Escovedo, or Pops 
as Sheila calls him, is a master percussionist 
across various instruments, but he’s most fa­
mously known as a timbalero. 
Lucky for you, he’s passed his 
wisdom on to his daughter. 
Sheila’s first exposure to 
the timbales was about as 
simultaneously intimate and 
world-class as you can get: 
living room jam sessions in the Escovedos’ 
Oakland home featuring not only her father 
but also her superstar godfather, Tito Puente, 
aka the King of the Timbales. It’s no wonder 
Sheila eventually picked up a similar honorif­
ic, the Queen of Percussion—but not without 
countless hours of practice and a learning-fo­
cused mindset that she maintains to this day.
The timbales are like a drum kit in minia­
ture. You can add on to them, but let’s start 
with the basics: the drums. They always come 
as a pair and are different sizes—typically one 
is 13 inches and the other is 14 inches. They 
look similar to the tom-toms on a standard 
drum kit but are shallower, usually tuned 
significantly higher, and offer three distinct 
areas of play:
Head: The top of the drum. This area 
will create the most resonant sound.
Rim: The edge of the drum, where the 
head meets the body. This area offers 
a piercing sound.
Cáscara: The side of the drum, where, 
depending on the material used to make 
the drum shell, you can create a hard 
and crisp metallic or wooden sound.
The most common addition to the timbales is 
a cowbell (or two). There are several varieties 
of cowbell, but Sheila uses a mambo bell and 
a cha-cha bell. She also points out that you 
can sometimes get two separate tones from 
one large bell by hitting it in different places. 
A clave block is also a popular add-on—
these are typically made of plastic and create 
a dry, bright sound. You can also add a cym­
MEET THE TIMBALES

1818
bal to your timbale setup, and some percus­
sionists go as far as to incorporate a snare 
and kick drum.
Though you use sticks to play the timbales, 
the strikes are conceptually similar to the 
congas:
Open: Strike near the center of the 
drumhead. 
Muffled: Press down on the head with 
one stick while striking with the other.
Rim shot: Simultaneously strike the rim 
and the edge of the head with one stick.
Side stick: With one stick laid across the 
head, “click” the stick against the rim.

THE TIMBALE BUYING FAQ
What should I start with?
In addition to the two different-size drums 
and the stand they come on, you’ll likely 
want timbale sticks (thinner than drum­
sticks), a cowbell, and a clave block.
Can I buy them used?
Definitely, but tread lightly. Make sure a 
working stand is included; carefully check 
the shells for cracks, rust, or holes; prioritize 
new heads; and ask for extras like cowbells.
What size do I want?
The drums should be either 13 and 14 inches 
(standard), or 14 and 15 inches (also com­
mon—Sheila plays these sizes). The bigger 
they are, the louder they’ll be. 
Brass, steel, bronze, or wood?
The material of the drum shell affects the 
sound. Brass is generally warmer sounding, 
steel is sharper, and bronze is in between. 
Wood is harder to find and to work with.
Do drumheads matter?
Yes. Calfskin heads will give you the most 
authentic sound. Plastic heads can create a 
ringing effect, but there are quality synthet­
ics on the market that improve upon this.

like ‘This is home,’ ” says Sheila. Here 
are her essentials
Zildjian Drumstick Wax: “It’s wax that 
goes on my sticks so I’m able to grip them. 
I carry it wherever I go because if I don’t 
have it, I don’t feel like I’m Sheila E., literal­
ly. It’s like wax you put on a surfboard—it 
almost smells like I’m on the beach.”

and I’ve been using it since the early 
’90s. It’s amazing.”
DW 9002 Double Kick Pedal (With 
Extended Drive Shaft): “I play with my 
double kick pedal on the outside of the 
hi-hat, so an extended kick pedal rod is 
crucial to my setup.”
DW Claw Hook Accessory Clamp 
and LP Mambo Cowbell: “The clamp 
holds the cowbell on top of the kick drum, 
and that’s where it’s most comfortable for 
me. If I don’t have that, because of the size 
and the flatness of the cowbell, it changes 
how I play.”
Custom-Made DW Kick Drum: “Most 
drummers play a 22-inch kick drum, 
but because I’m fairly small, I’ve got a 
20-inch kick. I can still get a big sound—I 
always use a hard-surfaced beater on 
my pedals.”
Custom-Made DW Snare Drum: 
“I started using a smaller snare so every­
thing is more compact and easier for me 
to play. That way I can sit in the position I 
need to and not hurt myself. Everything is 
sitting right in front of me so I don’t have 
to reach.”
 
DW 9500 Heavy-Duty Two-Leg 
Hi-Hat Stand: “I need a two-legged 
hi-hat stand so I can utilize the double 
pedal on the outside of the stand. Some­
times it feels like my legs are a second 
set of arms, so if I can’t play double kick, 
I feel like I’m missing an arm.”
DW 9000 Heavy-Duty Air Lift Snare 
Stand: “A standard snare doesn’t al­
ways let you maneuver depth as well as 
height, but you’re allowed to switch and 
turn this stand every possible way. That’s 
important so I can sit down straight and 
at a safe level.”
Zildjian Platinum Series Cymbals: 
“I use 13-inch hi-hats, 17- and 18-inch 
crashes, a 20-inch ride, and a 14-inch 
China. I adjust my cymbals as tight as 
they can go on the stand. If they’re loose, 
I’ll cut my fingers because of the way 
that I learned to play.”
Remo Emperor Clear Drumheads: 
“The last thing is the drumheads, but 
they are very important to what sound 
I’d like to convey. I used to use Remo 
Pinstripes for more of the muted funk 
tones, but the Emperors are my favorite 
drumheads right now.”

SHEILA’S KIT

2020
THE QUEEN E. 
Sheila has perfected her drum 
setup, which makes it easy for 
her to find her groove.

2121
“Drum solos are not that important,” says 
Sheila, and she has a point. You’ve got to crawl 
before you can walk, run, skip, jump, flip, and 
parkour off of a nearby building. At the same 
time, Sheila very much knows the allure—You­
Tube has about four decades’ worth of clips 
showing her improvising incredible solos to 
grateful audiences the 
world over. Yes, solos are 
flashy and fun, but they 
serve a practical function 
as well: helping the drum­
mer find their voice. 
What do you sound like 
when you let loose? When 
you’re perfectly aligned 
with the beat and free to 
play—for a few bars or a few minutes—literal­
ly anything that comes to mind? It can be a 
powerful learning experience, a place for in­
structive mistakes and emboldening victories. 
But let’s start small. In your exercises so 
far, there’s a good chance you’ve already 
played around within the metronome click 
and found the space between beats, going 
beyond the double stroke into the triple and 
maybe a full-on roll or introducing other per­
cussive sounds. As long as you’re keeping 
time, that’s great. That sort of experimenta­
tion leads nicely into a fill, or a brief depar­
ture from the prevailing rhythmic pattern of 
the song that serves to set up and give ener­
gy to transitional moments (say, just before a 
verse, chorus, or bridge). 
One way to think of a fill is as a mini solo: 
It’s typically improvised, adds flair, and is an 
expression of the drummer’s voice. Fills may 
involve creating a fresh rhythm on the hi-hat 
or playing a few additional hits on a tom or 
snare. Regardless, the fill is meant to comple­
ment the song. “It’s a conversation,” Sheila 
says. “Be creative and feel out what really 
makes sense for the song.”
A solo, on the other hand, can be just 
about anything you want it to be—though, if 
you’re in a band, make sure everyone is on the 
same page. Solos are instrumental breaks 
within a song, live or recorded, that are often 
improvised and vary wildly in length (see the 
chapter playlist). They are showcases for the 
ability and creativity of the drummer, who is 
free to step outside of the genre, structure, 
and even tempo of the song while the rest of 
the band stops playing. 
Soloing well isn’t about being loud or busy. 
> With your metronome going, play a basic beat. Let 
four bars (four counts of four) pass, and then try a fill. 
Keep it brief and punchy. Return immediately to the 
basic beat, let four more bars pass and try another 
one. Repeat this process until you can execute a fill 
without dropping the beat. When you feel comfort­
able, go for a solo. Just keep two things in mind: 1) 
getting good at soloing is a gradual process, and 2) 
the best way to learn is to experiment without fear 
of messing up. Mistakes can lead to revelations. As 
Sheila points out, if you repeat an initial “mistake” 
intentionally, it’s no longer a mistake. Solos and fills 
can also be executed on congas, timbales, or whatever 
you’ve got to practice on.

FINDING YOUR VOICE
“IF YOU’RE 
GOING TO MAKE 
A MISTAKE, MAKE 
A MISTAKE BIG AND 
LOUD, AND THEN 
DO IT AGAIN.”

As Sheila explains, what makes a solo suc­
cessful is a good buildup. You want to take 
the listener on a real journey, starting slow 
and introducing subtle shifts and surprising 
stunts until, well, “by the end it should just be 
big,” says Sheila. Nailing a solo feels amaz­
ing, but don’t forget that you are also on a 
journey, a lifelong one, as a drummer. As 
Sheila puts it: “I’m still trying to find my voice 
in soloing because I want to continue to be a 
student of life.... The more I allow myself to 
learn and create, the better I get.”
WHO RUN THE WORLD? 
WOMEN WITH RHYTHM
> As a young girl, Sheila only knew of one fe­
male drummer: the mighty Karen Carpenter, 
who both sang and kept time brilliantly in the 
Carpenters. Sheila’s family always encour­
aged her to pursue her passion, but she often 
ran into people in the industry who told her 
that drums are a man’s instrument. Sheila is 
one of many amazing women who’ve proved 
just how narrow-minded that outlook is. 
These other women have added their voices 
to the ongoing rhythmic conversation.
Moe Tucker (b. 1944): As a member of 
the Velvet Underground, Tucker was known 
for her unique style—playing while standing, 
eschewing cymbals, and using mallets in­
stead of sticks. Her minimal touch became 
the blueprint for punk’s simple rhythm.
Sandy West (b. 1959): West started play­
ing at nine years old, and by 15 she was keep­
ing time in the Runaways—the first major all-
teen, all-girl hard rock band in history. Before 
long, West was holding her own on tours with 
drum-forward giants like Van Halen.
Cindy Blackman (b. 1959): Inspired by 
her mother and grandmother (both clas­
sical musicians), Blackman studied music 
for virtually her entire life. She went on to 
play with a who’s who of jazz musicians 
(Pharoah Sanders, Ron Carter, John Me­
deski) and, perhaps most famously, tour 
with Lenny Kravitz. 
Janet Weiss (b. 1965): This Riot grrrl 
pioneer rose to fame as the timekeeper in 
Sleater-Kinney and became one of  the most 
in-demand drummers in indie rock, playing 
with Stephen Malkmus, Bright Eyes, Elliott 
Smith, the Shins, and many more.
Meg White (b. 1974): White came to the 
drums late in life (she started playing in 1997), 
but her primal, minimal, hard-driving style 
helped propel the White Stripes into the main­
stream. Her raw playing on “Seven Nation 
Army” is a legendary reminder of how power­
ful a simple style can be.

I’M GOING TO PLAY IT WITH EVERYTHING 
PLAYING 
WELL 
WITH 
OTHERS
You found your rhythm. You learned your 
rudiments and have been practicing daily. 
You know your way around your instrument 
and have maybe even pulled off a few fills or 
solos. All of that is excellent, but until you sit 
in with a band or play in a jam session, you 
likely won’t have a complete picture of how 
important the drummer’s role is in a group. 
“We’re the captain of the ship,” Sheila 
says. “It’s a very important part, and you’re 
going to have to take responsibility.” At the 
same time, it’s important to remember that 
being part of any musical collaboration is like 
taking part in a conversation. These five te­
nets will help you keep things flowing.
1. Keep time. 
If you haven’t gathered by now, this is Sheila’s 
biggest sticking point—and with good rea­
son. The drummer drives the rhythm of the 
song and, hence, the entire band. If you get 
excited and speed up or get lazy and slow 
down, the band has to follow. The most im­
portant thing you can do is maintain a steady 
tempo in order to create a groove that allows 
everyone else to do what they came there to 
do. As Sheila says, “I love soloing, [but] I’d 
just as soon play time for two hours with a 
band [where] we’re all moving together.”
2. Break it down. 
We’ve touched briefly on dynamics—this refers 
to the volume of the performance, which is dic­
tated by how hard or soft you hit your drums. 
You know about fills, which are usually played 
loudly and used to bring the energy up before a 
change in the song. Just as important as these 
is breaking it down. This means playing more 
softly, and the band typically follows suit in or­
> Get out and play. Call up some musician friends. 
Stop by local rehearsal rooms. Ask around at your 
go-to music shop. Sign up for group lessons. Check 
Craigslist. Look for a drum circle. However you do it, 
find someone to make music with. And if you only end 
up “in the room” at a studio or rehearsal space, make 
the most of it. Pay attention to how the musicians 
support one another, keep an eye on the drummer’s 
technique, and ask what you can do to help out.

der to make space for a vocalist’s verse, anoth­
er player’s solo, or band introductions in a live 
setting. You’d bring it back up for the chorus.
3. Know when not to play. 
Avoiding the urge to overplay is vital. Even 
if you’ve got the skills to drop fills into every 
gap, a kit that features every piece of percus­
sion on earth, and a deep familiarity with the 
music, never play just to play. This especially 
applies if you’re in a free-flowing jam (where 
every player needs to listen to the others) or 
hired to contribute to someone else’s session. 
4. Do your homework. 
You already know this first part: Practice all 
the time. But to expand on that, be sure you 
know how to play different types of rhythms, 
genres, and styles. Doing so will not only open 
up your creativity but prepare you for a wide 
range of collaboration opportunities. It’ll also 
increase what you bring to the table during a 
session. Another pointer: If you’re trying out for 
a band or heading into rehearsal, practice the 
songs that you’ll be playing ahead of time—
exhaustively. It’s a matter of respect, and the 
confidence you bring with you will be palpable. 
5. Just get in the room.
You may not have the opportunity to play 
how you want to—or to play at all—in a giv­
en situation. That’s fine. You can still learn a 
great deal by just being in the room. When 
Sheila was starting out, “There was nothing 
beneath me,” she says. “I’ll come in, hand out 
waters...whatever I could do to be a part of 
the team.” Playing for free, handling studio 
chores, or sitting on the sidelines isn’t only 
about learning to put your ego aside. It’s a 
chance to educate yourself firsthand and 
also prove yourself to future collaborators.

PREPARING 
TO PLAY 
ON STAGE
Sheila has brought impressive enthusiasm 
and discipline to her solo practice and to her 
bands throughout her career. It’s a habit she 
picked up by watching her dad run all-day 
drills as a bandleader, but her collabora­
tors know it as Sheila’s Bootcamp. “I love 
rehearsing,” says Sheila. “I don’t get to do 
it enough and everyone knows. For me, it’s, 
‘Let’s rehearse until we’re exhausted.’ ” True 
enough, her rehearsals are known to run as 
long as 12 hours, and they’re guided by a 
principle of intensity. “Whether you’re in the 
studio, the living room, or 
at soundcheck,” she says, 
“aggressively play as if 
the room is filled and sold 
out.” Whew.
That sounds grueling, 
but it serves a purpose—
several, actually, and they 
go beyond chops:
Forging band bonds: There’s nothing like 
working hard in the name of a common 
goal to bring people together. For that time, 
you’re sharing the entire world: sweat, food, 
frustration, fresh air, laughter, criticism, 
breakdowns, and breakthroughs. You be­
come a family. 
Encouraging new ideas: When everyone 
in the room knows a piece of music front to 
back, that’s the best time to find something 
new in the composition. Songs get totally 
reworked mid-recording this way, and set lists 
can be remixed during soundcheck.
Perfecting communication: The best 
bands have a secret language. That can 
mean literal words—in-jokes and shorthand 
speech—but also gestures, musical cues, 
looks, and the energy of a jam itself. This 
comes from spending time together. There’s 
no forcing it. 
Increasing onstage stamina: The last 
thing you want is to get on stage and be 
out of breath two songs into a set. Drum­
ming is hard work, and, as Sheila says, you 
ought to train like an athlete would. After

followed it to unexpected places
1. Santana, “Soul Sacrifice” 
(Live at Woodstock, 1969)
2. Jimi Hendrix, “Machine Gun” 
(Live at the Fillmore East, 1969)
3. The Allman Brothers Band, 
“Mountain Jam”

(Live in Atlantic City, 2010)
a 12-hour rehearsal, 45 minutes on stage is 
a breeze.
Making the gig more fun: If everyone 
in the band knows the music and under­
stands their role, no one will be stuck in their 
head during a real performance or looking 
around for guidance. You can enjoy the mo­
ment and play from the heart.
Serious rehearsals weed out the players who 
may not be as dedicated as you want them to 
be. Your rehearsals don’t have to be 12 hours 
long, especially if this is a hobby or you’re 
new to drums, but whoever you’re rehears­
ing with should share your goal. That is, in 
Sheila’s words, “to surround yourself with 
people who are encouraging and want the 
same outcome as you do, which is being bet­
ter than when we first walked into the room.”
> Even if you don’t yet have a band, look up local 
venues where you could play with one. Create a 
spreadsheet, listing the venue, the booking point 
of contact (POC), the venue and POC’s phone or 
email, and any other insight you might be able to 
glean from their website or a quick phone call. Do 
they need to hear a demo first? Will they require 
you to sell a minimum number of tickets? Are you 
responsible for bringing a PA system? Cast a wide 
net to get a sense of what’s out there, from parks 
and community centers to bars and clubs to restau­
rants and cafés. Get a sense of which kind of artists 
play where. Most importantly, now that you’ve 
got the lay of the land, get out and see a show—
something small so you can get up close. With a 
student’s eye, watch how other performers interact 
on stage. What do they get right? What do they get 
wrong, and why? While you’re there, make friends. 
You may find your future bandmates in the crowd.

PARADISO FOUND
This Amsterdam 
concert hall is one of 
Sheila’s most loved.

5. Blue Note Tokyo 
(Tokyo, Japan)
Though it only opened in 1988, 
this legendary jazz club has 
put on shows from countless 
greats, including Chick Corea, 
Sarah Vaughan, Milt Jackson, 
and Maceo Parker.
6. Quinta Vergara 
Amphitheater 
(Viña del Mar, Chile)
This architectural stunner 
opens up to what feels like a 
sea of trees and is home to 
the annual Viña del Mar Inter­
national Song Festival, the 
longest-running music fest 
in Latin America.
7. Staples Center 
(Los Angeles, California)
Yes it’s home to the L.A. 
Lakers, Clippers, and Kings 
(basketball, basketball, and 
hockey, for the uninitiated), 
but the 20,000-seat arena 
is also known for holding 
performances by pop giants 
and, for 20 years running, 
hosting the Grammys. 
1. Paradiso 
(Amsterdam, Netherlands)
A 19th-century church with 
high ceilings and two balcony 
levels that stack fans close 
but far above the stage, creat­
ing a uniquely vertical sense 
of intimacy.
2. Oakland Arena 
(Oakland, California)
With 360-degree seating, this 
former home of the Golden 
State Warriors was made to 
maximize the effect of scream­
ing fans.
3. Madison Square Garden 
(Manhattan, New York)
A proper purpose-built arena 
with room for 20,000 fans that 
has hosted boxing, hockey, pro 
wrestling, and more than 120 
Billy Joel concerts. 
4. The Greek Theatre 
(Berkeley, California)
This sizable amphitheater’s 
inaugural guest, in 1903, was 
sitting President Theodore 
Roosevelt. But it might be more 
famously known as the venue 
that hosted the Grateful Dead’s 
first concert.
IT’S SHOWTIME 
7 OF SHEILA’S FAVORITE VENUES 

2929
“THERE’S 
NOTHING THAT 
YOU CAN’T DO 
IF YOU JUST TRY. 
THINK OUTSIDE 
THE BOX.”
There came a point in Sheila’s career when 
she made a drastic shift. Yes, “Sheila Esco­
vedo” was already a gifted percussionist 
with a burgeoning career—an in-demand 
side player and behind-the-scenes studio 
star. But “Sheila E.,” she decided, would be 
a front-and-center sort of musician. It was, 
of course, more than a name change. As 
she toured the world behind her own music 
and as part of Prince’s musical family, Shei­
la quickly emerged as a fashion icon with 
a boldly creative and playfully provocative 
look. And she made sure her band matched.
“This comes from my daddy,” says Sheila. If 
you look up pictures of Azteca, you’ll see what 
she means. “You come 
dressed to impress. That 
way, when people come to 
see you live, they know it’s 
our thing. If we’re going to 
be a team, we need to be a 
team in every area.”
Sheila knows not everyone is interested in 
having a loud look—her sense of style today 
is clean, crisp, and grown-woman glam—but 
taking a little time to consider your aesthet­
ic is smart. It can up your inner confidence 
and outer allure, neither of which hurts your 
chances of getting the gig you’re pursuing. 
During an extracurricular chat, Sheila shared 
some fashion wisdom:
“If you’re trying to find your style, don’t be 
afraid to experiment, because the more that you 
try to find out who you are, the more you’ll grow 
as an artist. Start dabbling in different colors. 
Some people just want to wear black, but maybe

their look is that their hair is a bright color, or they 
have tattoos or piercings or glasses. You have to 
experiment, just like you do with music. You’re 
out there playing and writing with other people. 
With fashion you can be like, ‘I’m influenced by 
these four people. How can I make that look 
mine?’ Well, try it and see.
“I once wanted my hair a specific color be­
cause I saw it on someone as I was driving by 
them. I dyed my hair, then cut a piece off, sent 
it to the drum company, and said, “I want my 
drums to match my hair.” Not everyone is able to 
do that, but thinking about the overall package 
of what you’d like to present makes you different 
from everyone else. Everyone has a friend who 
can bedazzle something if you want to bedazzle 
your gear, which I do. You can also paint your 
gear yourself. There’s nothing that you can’t do 
if you just try. Think outside the box.”
GEAR GUIDE
CUSTOMIZE YOUR KIT
> When it comes to ways to trick out a 
drum set, you’re only limited by your imag­
ination. Here are five fairly common DIY 
approaches to making your instrument as 
unique as you are
Stencil the kick: Got a band logo or de­
sign you want people to stare at while you’re 
wailing on your kit? All you need is a sharp 
blade, stiff cardboard, and spray paint. 
Wrap the shells: There are various com­
panies that sell what basically amounts 
to wallpaper for your drums—some even 
allow you to upload your own artwork.
Paint the hardware: This involves com­
pletely disassembling your kit, but you can 
create eye-catching contrast by giving all 
the metal bits a new spray-painted hue.
Add some lights: The vibrancy, efficien­
cy, and availability of LEDs make it possi­
ble to light up your drums from the inside. 
You can buy ready-to-install light sets or 
find DIY approaches online.
Apply glitter tape: The easiest and 
cheapest hack of all. Visit a craft store 
or Amazon to buy as many rolls as you’d 
like in nearly any color you want. Then 
just stick it on.
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
 LISTEN UP 
This one’s up to you. Whether it’s Lizzo’s 
“Good as Hell” or Survivor’s “Eye of the Tiger,” 
everyone has songs that pump them up, stoke their 
confidence, and put a swagger in their step. 
Find five or so that do that for you. Alternately: 
Sheila’s The Glamorous Life album, of course.
> Grab a pen and paper. Think about the kind of 
music you play or would like to play. Quickly, without 
overthinking, write down as many words that come 
to mind that describe or embody some aspect of that 
music. Is it loud or quiet? Bright or dark? Spiky or 
smooth? Don’t be afraid to get abstract. What color is 
the music? If it was alive and standing in front of you, 
what would its personality be like? Would it invite you 
over for tea or slap you in the face? 
Once you’ve gathered a handful of these descrip­
tors, think about your current personal style. How 
does it fit with the music? If it doesn’t, consider 
how you can play with fashion using the words and 
phrases you wrote down. Would you want your 
look to align perfectly with the music or contrast it 
in a curious way? As Sheila suggests, consider the 
sartorial choices of people who you think are doing 
it right. How can you fold what you like about their 
style into what you do? If all of this still feels too 
hypothetical, peruse the aisles of a local thrift store, 
where you’re likely to find a wide variety of clothing 
representing different eras and styles. Grab a 
bunch of things you love, then mix and match to see 
if you can land on a look that feels right.

COMMIT TO YOUR CRAFT 
AND YOUR GOALS
Some number of years ago, Sheila realized 
she’d developed a regular habit of writing 
down the things she hoped to accomplish 
in both the near and far future. It was some­
thing she had just fallen into, but in time the 
habit became a practice and evolved into an 
extensive bucket list—“pages and pages and 
pages,” she says, of personal goals accom­
panied by due dates. 
Some entries, like hit­
ting the gym, are easy to 
keep putting off. Some 
get recalibrated over 
time—Sheila hoped to 
win a gold medal in the 
Olympics for running track, but she crossed 
that off once she earned a gold album 
(500,000 copies sold) for The Glamorous 
STAR POWER

> Start your bucket list with five entries and, for now, 
make them all music-related. Next to each entry, 
save room for three key pieces of data: a deadline, 
the date you started, and the date you finished. The 
deadline can be at any point in the future: three days 
from now or three years from now. Think of it as as­
pirational. If you eventually blow past your deadline, 
don’t beat yourself up—this is a living document. The 
aim is to update it regularly. Sheila does an in-depth 
review and refresh of her list at the beginning of each 
year and then revisits it every few months. 
Most importantly, be sure to give yourself one task 
that you can complete, or at least start, in the next day 
or two. It can be as simple as scheduling that rehears­
al, calling that local venue, or posting a note on a clas­
sifieds site like Craigslist looking for other musicians 
to jam with. “A lot of times we procrastinate, [but] we 
want to hold ourselves accountable for the things we 
say we’re going to do,” says Sheila. “Even if it’s just one 
thing [you do now], then you’ve done it!”

Life. Others, well, she gets exactly right: Shar­
ing her wisdom with you has been on Sheila’s 
list for two years.
If there’s one final thought Sheila wants to 
leave with you, it’s to never stop learning. You’ll 
never hear every genre, play every rhythm, rock 
every stage, or perform with everyone who can 
teach you something about your art. But you 
can—and should—try. Say “yes” to new expe­
riences, and when you hear the word no, treat 
it as an opportunity to try a new tack. 
You’d be surprised where saying “yes” can 
take you. It’s the flipside of a carefully curated 
bucket list—a random-experience generator 
that can unlock skills and interests within 
you that you didn’t even know you had. Just 
as you’re pushing yourself to master an in­
strument, push yourself to accomplish your 
goals, and again: learn, learn, learn.

“HAVE FUN, 
DANCE, 
LAUGH, 
LIVE YOUR 
LIFE.”
With POPS’ and Sheila’s blessing, you’re now 
an honorary Escovedo. Hopefully you’ve em­
braced the importance of practice, discov­
ered the value in collaboration, and learned 
a Latin rhythm or two. But there’s one more 
piece of the puzzle. It may seem ephemeral 
first, but the Escovedos know it as 
an incredibly real thing: the healing 
power of music. 
Thanks to the curative nature of 
self-expression and the communal 
spirit of song, music can be faith, 
comfort, an outlet, or a companion 
when any of those things are other­
wise lacking. As Sheila shares, there were times 
growing up that her family had trouble making 
ends meet, “but the best thing about the strug­
gle was how music was our gift, our hope, our 
excitement.... It brought people together in our 
house every single day.... Music was our outlet.”
Music has the power to bring families clos­
er, to heal communities, and to help young 
people focus their energy into something 
positive. Another Escovedo family tenet is 
to give back. In 2001, Sheila cofounded the 
Elevate Hope Foundation in order to bring 
therapy to abused or abandoned children 
through music and arts education. That 
initiative has since evolved into a program, 
Elevate Oakland, that helps Bay Area public 
schools more broadly. 
Sheila shares more about that in the exclu­
sive interview below, but it’s important to note 
that there are always ways for musicians to help 
out in their communities, regardless of stature 
or savings account. And to do so is to expand 
your own family in a deeply meaningful way.
THE POWER OF MUSIC
A HIGHER CAUSE 
> A brief chat with Sheila about her 
nonprofit, Elevate Oakland 
What is Elevate Oakland all about?
“We’re bringing music back to the public 
schools, and we use artists from the Bay 
Area to teach and assist in classes. Kids take 
classes for the semester and usually come in 
a couple times a week. Sometimes we record 
them or have them open for local artists like 
my dad or myself at venues like Yoshi’s in 
WELCOME 
TO THE FAMILY

Oakland. We initially started in foster care, 
but the need was so great at schools because 
of budget cuts—it’s horrible. The kids are 
coming to us, ‘We want to learn music, but 
our school doesn’t teach it. Can you help us?’ 
I mean, God, they’re asking for it.”
How have you interacted with 
the students?
“All of the founders, including me, have 
taught classes. We help with putting to­
gether events and work with kids one-on-
one because we notice a lot of them are in 
disarray. One student was really excited for 
us to listen to his song. He wrote it, made 
the beat, and rapped it. We started listen­
ing, and I realized he was talking about him­
self, about how he loves music but times are 
hard, and he’s sleeping in a friend’s car in 
front of the school—he was homeless. This is 
how they’re allowed to share their real sto­
ries, their lives, with other people.”
How have you seen Elevate Oakland 
make a difference?
“Some of the kids were acting up. We real­
ized it was because they wanted attention 
and help but didn’t know how to ask. As 
we focused on them and they started to ex­
press themselves through art, they opened 
up. Some of them told us they’re coming 
to school hungry because they don’t have 
money for food. They said, ‘You guys keep 
coming back and helping, so we believe 
you, we trust you. And we don’t trust any­
body.’ That trust itself is a breakthrough.”
Why was this important for you to do? 
“It started with my parents. When we were 
younger, we didn’t have much money, but 
my dad decided he was going to give back 
no matter what: We can get instruments, 
put the kids in the car, go to facilities for kids 
who are not doing well and play for them, 
put a smile on their face. We know how 
music’s been healing for us—it’s helped us 
through good times and bad—and how we 
can use creativity to express how we feel. 
We just want that for these kids.” 
> Research ways that you and your friends can help 
out in your community. Are there local organiza­
tions that send musicians to children’s hospitals or 
assisted-living facilities? Can you lend your time to 
community events or fundraisers? Or volunteer to 
help teach music at public schools, in after-school 
programs, or as a private tutor? Is there somewhere 
you can donate instruments you’re not using? You 
could even start a kid-friendly drum circle at your 
nearest park or farmers’ market. Find some way to 
experience this powerful aspect of music-making.

FROM SHEILA
“if you want this to be your career, you 
really have to work hard—and I mean 
extremely hard. And when you think that 
it’s hard enough, then go even further. 
Do it for yourself and believe in yourself. 
You have to be strong. If you show that 
you’re willing to work and put in the hours, 
that’ll change the world.”
