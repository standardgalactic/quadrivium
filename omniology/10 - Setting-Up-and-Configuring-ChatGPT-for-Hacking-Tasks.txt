SETTING UP AND CONFIGURING
CHATGPT FOR HACKING TASKS
The 
prompts 
you 
provide 
to 
ChatGPT
determine the responses you receive. Effective
prompts 
encourage 
exploration 
and 
help
achieve specific hacking goals.
Setting up ChatGPT for hacking tasks comes
with ethical considerations. It's vital to ensure
that its use aligns with legal and ethical
standards.
Selecting the appropriate hosting environment
for ChatGPT, whether on a local machine or a
cloud server, should be based on factors like
computing resources, budget, and privacy
considerations.
