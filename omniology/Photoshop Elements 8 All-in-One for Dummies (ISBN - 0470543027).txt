Introduction
P
hotoshop Elements has evolved through several generations to 
become a sophisticated photo editor. What was once a low-end, 
consumer-grade product is now a tool for novice photo editors, amateur 
photographers, and professionals alike.
Elements shines on its own turf and is distinguished from Adobe Photoshop 
in many ways. Not only a program for improving image quality, Elements is 
a complex software application that offers you many different editing tools 
for designing a variety of photo creations and sharing your photos in a num­
ber of ways. Of course, it also gives you all the standard editing features you 
need for, say, controlling image brightness or working with color correction.
Why should you buy Elements (and, ultimately, this book)? The range of 
people who can benefit from using Elements is wide and includes a vast 
audience. Elements has something for everyone — from beginning image 
editors to intermediate users to more advanced amateurs and professionals. 
And in Photoshop Elements 8, the Macintosh version is once again 
supported.
We’ll even stick out our necks a little and suggest that many Photoshop 
users can benefit greatly by adding Elements to their software tool chests. 
Why? Because Elements offers some wonderful creation and sharing tools 
that Photoshop hasn’t yet dreamed of supporting. For example, in 
Photoshop Elements 8, you can create postcards, greeting cards, calendars, 
and photo albums with just a few mouse clicks. You can place orders with 
online service centers that professionally print your photo creations. All 
these opportunities are available in Elements, and we cover these and many 
more creation ideas in Book IX.
Don’t think of Photoshop Elements as a scaled-down version of Adobe 
Photoshop. Those days are gone. If you’re a digital photographer and you 
shoot your pictures in JPEG, TIFF, or Camera Raw format, Elements has the 
tools for you to open, edit, and massage your pictures into professional 
images. If you worry about color profile embedding, forget it. Elements can 
handle the task for you, as we explain in Book IX, Chapter 2, which covers 
color profiling and printing. For the professional, Photoshop Elements has 
just about everything you need to create final images for color desktop and 
commercial printing.

About This Book
About This Book
This book is our best effort to provide a comprehensive view of a wildly 
feature-rich program for both Windows and Macintosh users. There’s a lot to 
Elements, and we try to offer you as much as possible within our limited 
amount of space. We begged for more pages, but alas, our publisher wants 
to get this book in your hands in full color and with an attractive price tag. 
Therefore, even though we may skip over a few little things, all you need to 
know about using Photoshop Elements for designing images for print, shar­
ing, Web hosting, versatile packaging, e-mailing, and more is covered in the 
pages ahead.
As we said, Photoshop Elements has something for just about everyone. We 
know that our audience is large and that not everyone will use every tool, 
command, or method described in this book. Therefore, we added a lot of 
cross-references in the text, in case you want to jump around. You can go to 
just about any chapter and start reading; if some concept needs more expla­
nation, we point you in the right direction for getting some background 
when it’s necessary.
If you’re new to a For Dummies All-in-One, you should be aware that a book 
in this series is really several books in one. This work contains nine separate 
books covering distinct areas of Photoshop Elements. You can jump around 
in the book and investigate the areas that interest you most. Generally, 
there’s no need to read through chapters in order before going to the chap­
ter dealing with the tasks you’re most interested in exploring.
Each of the nine books contains several chapters covering a particular cate­
gory of image editing, sharing files, and making creations.
Book I: Introducing Elements
We begin Book I by introducing you to Elements as it appears onscreen the 
first time you launch the program. The Elements Welcome screen permits 
you to enter several different workspaces. 
We talk about changing workspaces, setting up your work environment, 
looking at tools and menus, discovering the various panels, using shortcuts, 
and getting help in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, we explore in depth the tools 
used in Edit Full mode. We provide the basics for using the tools so you have 
a clear understanding of what they do before delving into chapters where we 
use the tools to create a variety of results.
In Chapter 3, we look at navigation and viewing. We explore using the 
Navigator panel, changing views between workspaces, zooming in and out of 
photos, and cover all you need to know about the Image window when work­
ing in Edit Full mode. In Chapter 4, we cover preference settings you use in the

About This Book
Organizer and Edit Full mode for customizing your workspace. Every prefer­
ence setting you can make in Photoshop Elements is covered in this chapter.
Book II: Elements Fundamentals
As the name implies, we talk about essential fundamentals in this book. Look 
here for opening, closing and saving files, using the Organizer workspace for 
Windows users and exploring Adobe Bridge for Macintosh users; acquiring 
images from your digital cameras and scanners; and a whole lot of coverage 
on sorting and finding your pictures. We also cover creating albums and key­
word tags, creating new catalogs, and backing up your photos.
Book III: Image Essentials
In this book, we handle all you’d ever want to know about the characteristics 
of images. This book is image-centric — the place where we cover many 
essentials such as resolution, color modes, file formats, working with 
Camera Raw, and managing color.
Book IV: Selections
This important book gives you all the juicy details and techniques on creat­
ing and modifying selections. You find out about each of the selection tools 
and how to modify selections, feather selections, and refine edges, as well as 
save and load selections.
Book V: Painting, Drawing, and Typing
If you want to know about the drawing and painting tools, this book’s for 
you. Here we cover the Brush and Pencil tools, along with the multifaceted 
Brushes panel. We also show you how to create vector shapes by using the 
shape tools and how to fill and stroke selections.
Head to this book to find out how to create both gradients and patterns and, 
last but not least, become familiar with the type tools and how to use them 
to create and edit standard type, type on and in a path, and type with special 
effects.
Book VI: Working with Layers and Masks
This book gives you everything you need to work with layers and masks. We 
show you how to save and edit selections as alpha channels so that you can 
reload them later. And we show you how to work with the various kinds of 
masks — quick masks, layer masks, and channel masks — and how you can 
use each to select difficult elements. We talk about managing layers, playing 
with opacity blends, and transforming and simplifying layers.

About the eCheat Sheet
Book VII: Filters, Effects, Styles, and Distortions
We filled this book with tons of handy tips and techniques on using filters to 
correct your images to make them sharper, blurrier, cleaner, and smoother — 
whatever fits your fancy. We give you the scoop on the Smart Filters feature, 
which enables you to apply filters nondestructively. You also find out how to 
use filters to give your image a certain special effect, such as a deckled edge 
or water droplets. Finally, we introduce the Liquify command so that you 
can see the wonder of its distortion tools — and how they can turn your 
image into digital taffy.
Book VIII: Retouching and Enhancing
You find everything you need to know about color correction or color 
enhancement in Book VIII — getting rid of colorcasts, improving contrast 
and saturation, remapping, and replacing colors.
In addition, we include using the focus and toning tools to manually lighten, 
darken, smooth, soften, and sharpen areas of your image. You get to see how 
you can use the Clone Stamp tool, the Healing tools, and the Red Eye tool to 
fix flaws and imperfections in your images, making them good as new. We 
also show you the Color Replacement tool and how to replace your image’s 
original color with the foreground color. Finally, you get some tidbits on how 
to composite images using some easy steps.
Book IX: Creating and Sharing with Elements
The wonderful world of creations and sharing is the topic for this book. 
Elements provides you with some extraordinary creation opportunities such 
as creating slide shows, photo books, calendars, greeting cards, flipbooks, 
and more. We go into detail for each of these creation options. Not all files 
are destined for online viewing, so we cover the complex world of printing 
color images and getting color right with color profiles in this book. Finally, 
we top off the last chapter with sharing projects using online services.

Icons Used in This Book
Conventions Used in This Book
Throughout this book, we point you to menus where commands are 
accessed frequently. A couple of things to remember are the references for 
where to go when we detail steps in a procedure. For accessing a menu com­
mand, you may see a sentence like this one:
Choose File➪Get Photos and Videos➪From Files and Folders.
When you see commands like this one mentioned, we’re asking you to click 
the File menu to open the drop-down menu, click the menu command 
labeled Get Photos and Videos, and then choose the command From Files 
and Folders from the submenu that appears.
Another convention we use refers to context menus. A context menu jumps 
up at your cursor position and shows you a menu similar to the menu you 
select at the top of the Elements workspace. To open a context menu, click 
the right mouse button. For Mac users with a one-button mouse, press the 
Control key and click to open a context menu.
A third item relates to using keystrokes on your keyboard. When we mention 
that some keys need to be pressed on your keyboard, the text is described 
like this:
Press Alt+Shift+Ctrl+S (Option+Shift+Ô+S on the Mac).
In this case, you hold down the Alt key, the Shift key, and the Control key 
and then press the S key (or hold down the Option key, the Shift key, and the 
Command key and then press the S key on the Mac). Then release all the 
keys at the same time.
Icons Used in This Book
In the margins throughout this book, you’ll see icons indicating that some­
thing important is stated in the respective text.
	
A Tip icon tells you about an alternative method for a procedure by giving 
you a shortcut, a workaround, or some other type of helpful information 
related to working on tasks in the section being discussed.
	
Pay particular attention when you see the Warning icon. This information 
informs you when you may experience a problem performing your work in 
Elements.

6
Where to Go from Here
	
This icon is a heads-up for something you may want to commit to memory. 
Usually, it tells you about a shortcut for a repetitive task, where remember­
ing a procedure can save you time.
	
Elements is a computer program, after all. No matter how hard we try to sim­
plify our explanation of features, we can’t entirely avoid the technical infor­
mation. If we think that a topic is complex, we use this icon to alert you that 
we’re moving into a complex subject. You won’t see many of these icons in 
the book because we try our best to bring the details to nontechnical terms.
	
This icon informs you that the item discussed is a new feature in Photoshop 
Elements 8.
Where to Go from Here
Feel free to jump around and pay special attention to the cross-referenced 
chapters, in case you get stuck on a concept. If you’re new to image editing, 
you’ll want to pick up some basics. Look over Books I and II to get a grip on 
images and the environment you work in with Elements.
When you need a little extra help, refer to Book I, Chapter 1, where we talk 
about using the online help documents available in Elements.
We wish you much success and enjoyment in using Adobe Photoshop 
Elements 8, and it’s our sincere wish that the pages ahead provide you with 
an informative and helpful view of the program.

ecause we try to present all books as stand­
alone elements so you can move around and 
jump in at any chapter, a little foundation always 
helps make understanding the big concepts a bit 
easier.
We start this book with some essentials related to 
the Elements workspace, tell you how to launch 
the program, and offer you a description of many 
resources available to you.
If you’re new to Elements, this book is your best 
starting place. Be sure to review Chapter 2 where 
we cover all the tools used in Edit Full mode 
and Chapter 4 where we talk about adjusting 
Preferences to customize your work environment.

W
ow! There’s a lot to Photoshop Elements 8! Just look at the many 
pages in this chapter — and we aren’t even going to talk about fixing 
up your pictures. We are, however, going to talk about some pretty essential 
stuff to help you move quickly and efficiently around the program, as well 
as figure out how to access all those wonderful tools that Elements offers 
you for editing your pictures.
This chapter may not be the most fun part of this book, 
but it is a critical first step for anyone new to Elements. 
Stay with us while we break down all the areas in the 
Photoshop Elements workspace where you can turn 
that photo of Aunt Gina into something that 
Whistler’s mom would envy.
Launching Elements
After running the installer from the Photoshop 
Elements DVD-ROM, double-click the program icon to 
launch Elements. Upon launch, you see the Adobe 
Photoshop Welcome screen, as shown in Figure 1-1 
(Windows) or Figure 1-3 (Mac).

10
Launching Elements
Figure 1-1: The Photoshop Elements Welcome screen for Windows.
At the left of the photo image in the Welcome screen (Windows), you find 
two buttons that take you to different windows where you can edit and man­
age your pictures. You also find some navigation buttons represented by left 
and right arrows, which are located in the lower-right corner. The buttons 
and arrows include
	
✓	Organize: Click the Organize button, and Elements opens the Organizer, 
the window where you take care of a plethora of file-management and 
organization tasks. Among other options, you can choose to load pic­
tures in the Organizer window so they’re ready to use for all your 
projects.
	
✓	Edit: Click the Edit button to open the Photoshop Elements Edit Full 
mode. Here you perform all the editing for your photos.
	
✓	Right arrow: Click the right arrow to advance to the next view in the 
Welcome screen.
	
✓	Left arrow: Click the left arrow to move to the previous view in the 
Welcome screen.
As you toggle screen views by clicking the left and right arrows, you find two 
additional buttons on the photo images, as shown in Figure 1-2. Click the 
Learn More button, and a Web page opens in your default Web browser 
where some help information is provided. Click the icon below See What 
You Can Do. An Adobe Flash video walks you through some steps related to 
the topic text at the top of the photo.
Each time you launch Photoshop Elements, the Welcome screen is the first 
item you see on your monitor. From the Welcome screen, you choose the 
kind of tasks you want to accomplish in a session. If you want to change

from one window to another, for example change from the Organizer to Edit 
Full mode, you can easily navigate workspaces after you open one editing 
environment, as we explain later in this chapter.
Figure 1-2: Click the right arrow, and the topic text and photo image in 
the Welcome screen changes.
	
The photo image you see in Figure 1-1, along with any of the help informa­
tion displayed there, may be slightly different from what you see on your 
monitor when you launch Elements. The Welcome screen appears in an 
Adobe Flash interface, and the photo images scroll through a series of differ­
ent images. You can manually scroll through the images and the help infor­
mation by clicking the arrows at the bottom-right corner of the Welcome 
screen.
On the Mac, you find a different Welcome screen with different options. The 
Mac version of Elements doesn’t have an Organizer. Instead, Adobe Bridge 
performs functions similar to the Organizer found on Windows. (For more 
information on Adobe Bridge, see Book II, Chapter 3.) Launch Elements on 
the Mac and you find a Welcome screen, as shown in Figure 1-3.
Options in the Mac Welcome screen include
	
✓	Start from Scratch: This button is the alternative to the Edit button 
found on the Windows Welcome screen. Click the button and the 
Photoshop Elements Edit Full mode opens.
	
✓	Browse with Adobe Bridge: Click this button to open Adobe Bridge, 
where you can organize and manage photos.

Launching Elements
	
✓	Import from Camera: Click this button to import photos from a camera

mand in the Organizer.

Opening the Organizer (Windows)
The Organizer is one of several different workspaces available to you with 
Photoshop Elements. Unless you have an immediate task at hand for editing 
a photo in the Edit Full workspace, the Organizer is often going to be your 
first workspace to visit. In the Organizer, you can manage photos and navi­
gate to every other editing workspace Elements provides you.
To open the Organizer, click the Organize button on the Welcome screen. 
When you first install Elements and first open the Organizer, you see an 
empty screen, as shown in Figure 1-4.
Photos are added to the Organizer window through a variety of options we 
cover in Book II, Chapter 1. For now, we focus on looking at the Organizer 
tools and understanding how they work. Some of the more important tools 
in the Organizer include
	
✓	Elements Organizer: Clicking this button opens a menu where you can 
choose to close, minimize, and maximize the Organizer workspace. The 
icon represents the Organizer, and in other workspaces, such as the 
Editors, clicking the icon returns you to the Organizer window.

preferences.)
	
✓	Catalog images: When you add photos to your catalog, image thumb­
nails appear in this window.
Opening Adobe Bridge (Mac)
On the Mac, you don’t have an Organizer. Elements ships with Adobe 
Bridge — a powerful organization tool used by Photoshop users. To open 
Adobe Bridge, launch Elements and click the Browse with Bridge button. 
The Adobe Bridge workspace opens, as shown in Figure 1-5.
	
Adobe Bridge is a standalone application. You can create an alias and add it 
to the Dock or double-click the program icon in your Applications folder on 
your root drive. You don’t need to launch Elements in order to organize and 
view files in Adobe Bridge.
You find some similar features in Adobe Bridge as in the Organizer. For a 
detailed view of Adobe Bridge, look over Book II, Chapter 3.

Changing Workspaces
Think of the Organizer as your central workspace. From there, you travel to 
other workspaces where edits and creations are handled. The Organizer is 
like a huge file cabinet with a vast number of tools and commands that help 
you keep track of your images. It also offers you a gateway to other 
workspaces.
Visiting the Organizer (Windows)
You can’t do much with the window shown in Figure 1-1 because you haven’t 
added any photos. In order to manage photos and apply edits, you need to 
load some photos in the default catalog that appears (empty, obviously) 
when you first launch Elements.
To add some photos to the default catalog, do the following:
	
1.	 Copy some photos to your hard drive.
	
	 Make a new folder on your hard drive and call it something like My 
Photos or use some other descriptive name.

16
Changing Workspaces
	
2.	 Launch Elements.
	
	 Double-click the program icon or use the Start menu to open Elements.
	
3.	 Click Organize in the Welcome screen.
	
4.	 Choose File➪Get Photos and Videos➪From Files and Folders.
	
	 The Get Photos and Videos from Files and Folders dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 1-6. Open the Look In menu and navigate your hard 
drive to locate the folder where you copied your photos.
Figure 1-6: You select photos to import in a catalog from the Get 
Photos and Videos from Files and Folders dialog box.
	
5.	 Select the photos to import.
	
	 If you want to import all photos from a given folder, press Ctrl+A (Ô+A 
on the Mac). If you want to select individual photos, click a photo and 
press the Ctrl (Ô) key while clicking additional photos.
	
6.	 Click the Get Media button to import the photos into your catalog.
	
	 You have some other options available in the Get Photos and Videos 
from Files and Folders dialog box. But for now, just click Get Media and 
leave all the other items at the defaults.
	
7.	 Click OK in the alert dialog box.
	
	 An alert dialog box opens, informing you that you need to click the Show 
All button if you want to see all photos in your catalog. This button 
appears at the top of the Organizer window, as shown in Figure 1-7.

to scroll through the images.
Figure 1-8: Photos are added to the default catalog.
	
When you open the Get Photos and Videos from Files and Folders dialog 
box, you see thumbnail previews for images saved as JPEG or TIFF files. If 
you import Camera Raw images, you won’t see image previews. For more 
information on working with Camera Raw images, see Book III, Chapter 3.
A number of file-management options are available in the Organizer for sort­
ing images, tagging files with keywords, and creating albums of photos. We 
cover all you can do with file management in the section about the Organizer 
in Book II, Chapter 2.

18
Changing Workspaces
Visiting Adobe Bridge (Mac)
On the Mac, you can easily copy photos to folders from the Desktop. Photos 
can be organized in subfolders, and all the folders are accessible to Adobe 
Bridge. When you launch Bridge, use the Folders tab (refer to Figure 1-5) to 
browse your hard drive to view thumbnail images of your photos. (We offer 
more detail on navigating the Bridge window in Book II, Chapter 3.)
Visiting Edit Full mode
Elements provides you with two editing modes — Edit Full and Edit Quick. 
The Edit Full mode is where you have access to all the tools and commands 
that provide you limitless opportunities for editing your pictures. Edit Quick 
mode can be used when you need to polish up an image in terms of bright­
ness, contrast, color adjustments, and other similar editing tasks.
After you have files loaded in the Organizer (or Adobe Bridge on the Mac), 
you can easily open an image in an editing mode. Assuming you want to edit 
a picture, do the following to launch the Edit Full mode workspace:
	
1.	 Click an image thumbnail in the Organizer.
	
	 Following this step presumes you have added photos to the Organizer, 
as we describe earlier in this chapter.
	
2.	 Open the Fix drop-down list and choose Edit Photos.
	
	 At the top of the Organizer window, you see the Fix drop-down list, as 
shown in Figure 1-9. After making the menu choice, the selected image 
appears in the Edit Full workspace, as shown in Figure 1-10.
	
	 On the Mac, double-click a 
photo in Abobe Bridge to open 
it in Elements Edit Full mode. If 
you have Adobe Photoshop 
installed and double-clicking a 
photo opens the image in 
Photoshop, you can click a 
photo, press the Control key, 
and click to open a context 
menu. From the menu options, 
choose Open With➪Adobe Photoshop Elements 8.0.
	
3.	 Click the Organizer button in the Edit Full mode workspace.
	
	 To return to the Organizer, click the Organizer button, as shown in 
Figure 1-10.
Figure 1-9: Choose Edit Photos from the Fix 
drop-down list.

Figure 1-10: After choosing Edit Full from the Fix drop-down list, the file opens in the Edit Full 
workspace. To return to the Organizer, click the Organizer button.
When you open a file from the Organizer or you change to another work­
space while the Organizer is open, you have two workspaces open in 
Elements. The second workspace (such as Edit Full mode) opens while the 
Organizer remains open. When you toggle back and forth between the 
modes, each mode remains open until you quit one mode or the other.
Visiting Edit Quick mode
If you’ve worked in earlier versions of Elements, you know that the Organizer 
provided you a direct link to either Edit Full mode or Edit Quick mode. 
Elements 8 has a slight change — you can only go directly to Edit Full mode 
from the Organizer.

20
Changing Workspaces
The Edit Quick mode is easily opened 
after you enter Edit Full mode. While 
in Edit Full mode, choose Edit Quick 
from the Edit Full drop-down list, as 
shown in Figure 1-11.
Comparing the modes
When you examine Figures 1-8, 
1-10, and 1-12, you see different 
tools and panel options. Each mode 
is designed to help you with different tasks. In Figure 1-8, you see the 
Organizer where you can manage files and easily work with projects and file 
sharing. In Edit Full mode, as shown in Figure 1-10, you have access to all of 
the Elements editing tools and menu commands to enhance your photos in 
limitless ways. In Edit Quick mode, as shown in Figure 1-12, you see the dif­
ferent options for giving images a quick makeover.
Figure 1-12: Edit Quick mode.
Figure 1-11: While in Edit Full mode, you can 
easily open Edit Quick mode by choosing Edit 
Quick from the Edit Full drop-down list.

In the following chapters, we cover each of the modes, the tools accessible 
in each mode, and all the menu com­
mands accessible to you for each 
mode. Be sure you understand how 
to toggle through the modes to gain 
access to the tools you want to use.
	
In addition to the buttons at the top 
of the Organizer and those in the 
Panel Bin, when in either editing 
mode you can easily navigate 
modes using the status bar 
(Windows) or the Dock (Mac). The 
status bar (Dock) serves to open 
applications. Click an application to 
open the workspace you want.
Getting help with 
Guided mode
Although not entirely a separate 
mode, the Guided panel changes the 
appearance of the Panel Bin to offer 
you help with many different editing 
tasks. When in either Edit Full or 
Edit Quick mode, choose Edit 
Guided from the Editor drop-down 
list. The Guided Edit panel opens, as 
shown in Figure 1-13.
The panel lists topics for you to 
review when performing edits rela­
tive to a particular category. Click 
one of the category items and the 
panel changes, displaying info tai­
lored to that specific editing task as 
well as some options for performing 
a given edit. We clicked Crop Photo 
to open the Crop panel, as shown in 
Figure 1-14. From the Crop Box Size 
drop-down list, we chose 2.5 x 2 in.
Figure 1-13: Choose Edit Guided from the 
Editor drop-down list to open the Guided Edit 
panel.

22
Moving through the Menu Bar
Figure 1-14: The Crop panel offers options for cropping images to standard photo sizes by 
making choices in a drop-down list.
Click other items in the Guided panel and you find helpful hints to guide you 
through a number of common image-editing tasks.
Moving through the Menu Bar
As with most programs on your computer, Elements offers you a number of 
drop-down lists with many different commands that invoke actions. It’s not 
important to memorize all the menu commands. Instead, try to develop an 
understanding of the types of actions included in a given menu. A general 
understanding of uses of the different menus helps you find commands 
much faster.
The menus in the Organizer are different from those in the two editing 
modes. Edit Full and Edit Quick contain the same menu names, but some 
menu commands are grayed out when in Edit Quick mode.

23
Book I 
Chapter 1
Examining the 
Elements 
Environment
Moving through the Menu Bar
First, take a look at the menus in the Organizer. Among the Organizer menus 
you find
	
✓	File: In the File menu, as you might expect, you find commands to open 
and browse files on your hard disk. You also find a number of options 
for saving files, such as writing images to CD-ROMs, DVDs, and remov­
able media. Commands for managing catalogs, moving files, and printing 
images are also located in this menu.
	
✓	Edit: Many items you’re familiar with — copy, undo, delete, and so on — 
are located in the Edit menu. In the Organizer, you also find many 
options for sorting files as well as options for managing color. In addi­
tion, you find a number of quick-access commands for editing photos 
similar to options you find in Edit Quick mode.
	
✓	Find: The Find menu is all about finding images on your computer. You 
have many choices for searching photos based on a wide range of criteria.
	
✓	View: The View menu handles commands related to viewing images in 
the Organizer window. You can choose what types of media to display in 
the Organizer, show and hide files, and show and hide certain data asso­
ciated with files such as the filenames. Choices you make in this menu 
relate to the displays of images in the Organizer.
	
✓	Window: The Window menu contains commands that display some 
items in the Organizer such as the Timeline, where you can view photos 
according to date ranges. The Window menu also has commands for 
controlling the display of some panels in the Panel Bin, such as the 
Quick Share and Properties panels.
	
✓	Help: As you might expect, the Help menu contains menu commands 
that provide help when working in Elements. Certain help commands 
open your default Web browser and open help Web pages on Adobe’s 
Web site.
Keep in mind that the Organizer is quite distinct from the two editing modes. 
It turns out, though, that the Edit Quick and Edit Full modes are identical in 
terms of menu names, and both contain many similar commands. What you 
find in the editing modes for the most part is very different from the menu 
items found in the Organizer. Both Edit Quick and Edit Full modes contain 
the following menus:
	
✓	File: You find file-opening and -saving options in the File menu as well as 
printing commands. The File menu also contains some options for com­
bining images and batch-processing files.

24
Moving through the Menu Bar
	
✓	Edit: The Edit menu offers you a number of editing options, such as 
copy/paste, copy merged, paste into selections, setting up files, and 
using patterns and brushes. You also find color-management options 
identical to the commands in the Organizer Edit menu.
	
✓	Image: The Image menu contains commands that are used for changing 
images, such as cropping, resizing, changing color modes, converting 
color profiles, and transforming images/selections. Notice that there are 
no image corrections for brightness and color adjustments. These com­
mands are contained in the Enhance menu.
	
✓	Enhance: The Enhance menu is all about working with images in terms 
of color and brightness corrections and altering the visual appearance 
of images.
	
✓	Layer: The Layer menu has to do with working with layers and gives you 
access to the many different things you can do with layers.
	
✓	Select: The Select menu has to do with creating and using selections. 
One of the most frequent phases of an edit is creating a selection, and 
the Selection menu provides you with a number of commands and tools 
to help you perfect your selection of image content.
	
✓	Filter: For artistic edits, take a look at the Filter menu and explore the 
many filter effects you can add to your pictures. You don’t need to be a 
Photoshop Elements expert. The program makes it easy for you by keep­
ing all the filters in one place so that with the click of the mouse button, 
you can create some dazzling effects.
	
✓	View: Viewing options in the Editors relate to zooming in and out of pho­
tos, showing rulers and guides, and creating new windows.
	
✓	Window: The Window menu displays a list of panels that can be opened 
and closed. You also find a list of all open files in this menu up to a maxi­
mum number of windows you determine in the Elements preferences.
	
✓	Help: The Help menu is identical to the Organizer Help menu in 
Windows. On the Mac, you have a Help menu with various help options 
in Adobe Bridge that are much different from the Help menu options in 
Elements.
Why review a brief explanation of the menus and the commands you find 
within the drop-down lists? For starters, the more you know about what a 
menu is used for, the easier it is for you to locate commands without a strug­
gle. If your task is to color-correct a photo, you know from the list we 
describe here that you open one of the Editing modes and visit the Enhance 
menu. If you want to stack photos and organize them, you know that you 
need to open the Organizer and open the Edit menu. After you get a feel for 
what commands are contained within the drop-down lists, you move much 
faster in all your Elements editing sessions.

Using Context Menus
Using Context Menus
Context menus are found in just about every Adobe program. One of the 
great things about context menus is that if you want to perform an action 
using a menu command or tool, chances are you may find just what you’re 
looking for in a context menu.
A context menu is opened by right-clicking the mouse button (Windows) or 
by Control-clicking (Mac). Depending on the tool and the mode you’re work­
ing in, the menu commands change. For example, in Figure 1-15, we opened a 
context menu on a thumbnail image in the Organizer. As you can see in the 
figure, a number of menu commands are available that are similar to the 
menu commands you find in the top-level menu commands.
Figure 1-15: Context menus provide you 
quick access to menu commands.
	
Mac users with a two-button mouse can right-click to open a context menu.

26
Selecting Settings in the Options Bar
In Figure 1-16, we opened an image in Edit Full mode and created a selection. 
When we right-click the mouse button, the context menu changes to reflect 
edits we can make relative to a selection.
Figure 1-16: We created a selection in Edit Full mode and opened a 
context menu.
	
When you change tools and editing modes, the context menus you open 
change the menu choices to reflect what you can do with the selected tool 
and editing mode you’re working in.
Selecting Settings in the Options Bar
A number of different tools and options exist in several places in each mode. 
One area you frequently visit when you edit pictures is the Options bar. The 
Options bar provides several choices for each tool you select in Edit Full 
mode. In Figure 1-17, we opened Edit Full mode and clicked the Rectangular 
Marquee tool. The Options bar changes to reflect a number of choices you 
can use when working with this tool.

As you click different tools in the Tools panel, the Options bar changes to 
offer a number of different choices for working with the selected tool.
Playing with Panels
The Panel Bin contains more choices for editing files, assembling projects, and 
working with different tools. Each mode you visit (Organizer, Edit Full, and 
Edit Quick) supports panels and a variety of options from panel menus and 
tools. In Edit Full mode, you see the default panels open, as shown in 
Figure 1-18.

28
Playing with Panels
At the top of the Panel Bin are tabs. In Edit Full mode, the tabs include Edit 
Full, Create, and Share. Click a tab, and the panel options change. Below the 
tabs are also other buttons that open different modes. For example, the 
panel shown in Figure 1-18 displays the Edit Full mode. Clicking the other 
panel buttons, such as Create and Share, changes the panels and the 
options.
Figure 1-18: The default panel view in Edit 
Full mode.
If you open the Organizer, you find different options in the Panel Bin, as 
shown in Figure 1-19. From this panel, you can easily open the other editing 
modes, perform some creation edits, or organize files using tags and 
keywords.
Getting choosy in the Favorites panel
The Favorites panel is used for adding your own favorite settings in Edit Full 
mode, such as different filters you like to apply to images. By default, you 
don’t see the Favorites panel open. Open the panel by choosing Window➪
Favorites. When you make the menu choice, the panel opens as a floating 
panel in the middle of the Image window. A floating panel opens on top of 
the Elements window and can be dragged around to move the panel out of 
the way when editing photos.

Figure 1-19: Panel options change in the Organizer.
You can choose to keep the panel open 
in the Image window or dock the panel 
in the Panel Bin by dragging the Panel 
tab to the Panel Bin. In Figure 1-20, you 
see the Favorites panel as a floating 
panel with some favorite filters added 
to the panel.
Using panel buttons
Above the Panel Bin you have three 
buttons that you can click to work with 
the Editors, create projects, and share 
projects.
	
Expanded panels appear by default; 
however, new in Elements 8 is a 
method for collapsing panels. When 
panels are collapsed, panel buttons 
Figure 1-20: The Favorites panel opened as a 
floating panel.

30
Using the Project Bin
replace the expanded panels with buttons in the Panel Bin. Click the right 
chevron in the top-right corner, and the panels collapse, as shown in 
Figure 1-21. When the panels are collapsed, you can expand the panels 
by clicking the left chevron.
When panels are collapsed, you have much more editing room for your 
images in a larger Image window while still being able to access the panels.
Resetting panels
Panels can be removed from the Panel Bin by clicking and dragging the panel 
tab where you see the name of the panel. You can scatter panels all over 
your Elements workspace.
If, after rearranging panels, you want to return to the default view, click the 
Reset Panels button appearing at the top of the Elements window.
Using the Project Bin
You may have several images you 
want to edit in Elements. You might 
have some image data you want to 
copy from one image and paste into 
another image or maybe you want to 
enhance a series of images so the 
brightness and color appear consis­
tent for several images taken with 
the same lighting conditions.
The photos are added to the 
Organizer, and you can easily see the 
thumbnail images in the Organizer 
window. But you don’t want to keep 
going back to the Organizer to open 
one image or another in an editing 
mode.
Fortunately, Elements provides with you an easy way to load some images 
while in Edit Full mode and have the thumbnails displayed in the Project Bin, 
as shown in Figure 1-22.
	
Additionally, notice the top of the Image window. All the open files appear 
nested in the Image window with the filename displayed for each open 
image. You can close an image by clicking the X to the right of the filename.

See Book I, Chapter 4 for more on setting preferences.
The images shown in the Project Bin are easily accessed by clicking the 
respective filename appearing above the Image window. You can also open 
several files in Edit Full mode and create a project from the files, such as a 
calendar or photo book. What you see in the Project Bin are the files that are 
currently open in Edit Full mode.

Getting Productive with Shortcuts
You can easily change the view for all open images by opening the Arrange 
drop-down list and choosing an option, such as the Tile All in Grid option we 
chose in Figure 1-23.

Getting Productive with Shortcuts
Every Adobe program supports keyboard shortcuts, and Elements makes 
use of many different keystroke actions that open menus and select various 
tools. As a matter of fact, the keystroke commands available to you are so 
numerous that it’d take considerable time to commit them all to memory.

33
Book I 
Chapter 1
Examining the 
Elements 
Environment
Getting Productive with Shortcuts
Fortunately, you have many hints 
provided by Elements as you orga­
nize and work on your photos. The 
hints you find for using keyboard 
shortcuts are found in
	
✓	Menus: When you open a menu 
and scan through the different 
commands, you find that many 
commands list a keyboard short­
cut, as shown in Figure 1-24.
	
	Look at Figure 1-24. If you want 
to use Auto Smart Fix (the first 
menu item), press Alt+Ctrl+M 
(Option+Ô+M on the Mac) to 
invoke the menu command. 
Using the keyboard shortcut 
results in exactly the same 
action as selecting the menu 
command.
	
✓	Tools: When you move the cursor over a 
tool in the Tools panel, a pop-up tooltip 
opens, as shown in Figure 1-25. To the right 
of the tool name, you see a character within 
parentheses. Typing the character on your 
keyboard accesses the tool. For example, in 
Figure 1-25 you see the Horizontal Type Tool 
below the selection arrow. The character in 
the tooltip is T. If you press T on your key­
board, the Horizontal Type tool is selected. 
Each of the tools is selected by typing indi­
vidual characters on the keyboard.
The best way to figure out keyboard shortcuts is 
to observe the menus and tools when you per­
form edits. For those edits you use frequently, 
try to commit the keyboard shortcuts to mem­
ory. As you figure out more shortcuts, you’ll find 
working in Elements goes much faster.
Figure 1-25: A tooltip displays 
the keyboard shortcut for the 
tool.
Figure 1-24: The items to the right of the menu 
commands display keyboard shortcuts.

Finding Help When You Need It
Finding Help When You Need It
We hope this book provides you with some helpful information on using all the 
features you have available when working in Photoshop Elements. However, 
you won’t want to keep paging through the book for every edit you make.
For speedy access to readily available help information or when you want to 
expand your knowledge of commands, tools, procedures, and so on, you 
have several sources of help information.
Using Help
The first place to explore is the Help menu. Open the Help menu and you 
find a menu command to access the Photoshop Elements help guide. The 
help guide is a Web-based file that’s hosted on Adobe’s Web site. You need 
an Internet connection in order to access the file.
After choosing Help➪Photoshop Elements Help or pressing the F1 key on 
your keyboard, you can search for keywords. Press the Enter key after typ­
ing the words you want to search for, and Elements opens a panel on the left 
listing areas where you can find answers. Double-click an item, and the right 
pane provides you with help information.
Reading PDFs from the Installer DVD-ROM
On the Installer DVD-ROM, you find several PDF documents. You need Adobe 
Reader installed on your computer to see these files. The Installer disc con­
tains the Adobe Reader installer. Double-click the installer to install Adobe 
Reader. Then, take some time to browse the contents of the DVD-ROM for 
PDF documents.
Using tooltips
We cover tooltips earlier when we talk about keyboard shortcuts in 
Elements. As you place the cursor over tools and in panels, you can observe 
the tooltips. These contain some helpful information concerning the types of 
edits you want to perform or notification of an action that will take place 
when you click an object or command.

ou edit photos by using menu commands and tools. Elements knows 
that, so it provides you with a toolshed chock-full of different tools to 
perform all sorts of different editing tasks.
These tasks include selecting image content area, refining and sharpening 
photos, drawing and painting applications, adding text, and more.
In addition to using tools for manually changing the characteristics of a 
photo, you can use a number of different tools to magically automate tasks. 
In this chapter, you take a look at the Tools panel and all the different tools 
at your disposal for modifying photos in many different ways.
Examining the Tools Panel
The Tools panel opens by default when you enter Edit 
Full mode. As you may recall from Chapter 1 of this 
minibook, you can open Edit Full mode directly 
from the Welcome screen by clicking the Edit 
button or by choosing Editor➪Edit Full in the 
Organizer (Windows) or by opening a context menu 
in Adobe Bridge and choosing Open With➪Adobe 
Photoshop Elements 8.0 (Mac).
The tools you see in Figure 2-1 are listed by name and 
their keyboard shortcuts. If you press the key adjacent to 
the tools shown in Figure 2-1, you select the respective tool. 
See Chapter 1 in this minibook for more on keyboard shortcuts.
The tools in the Tools panel include the following, listed (basically) from top 
to bottom. To get you into the habit of using keyboard shortcuts, we’ve 
listed the shortcut associated with each tool.

Where you see a tiny right arrow on a tool, you find additional tools that 
open in a flyout menu. Pressing the same keyboard shortcut scrolls through 
the tools in the flyout menu.
	
V.	Move tool: Use this tool to move either content within a selection or the 
entire image.
	
Z.	Zoom tool: Click with this tool found in the Tools panel and you zoom in 
on an image. Press the Alt (Option on the Mac) key when the tool is 
selected and click to zoom out.
	
H.	Hand tool: The Hand tool is used to move an image around the Image 
window without changing the image position on the canvas. If you zoom 
in on a photo and see scroll bars on the right and left side of the Image 
window, you can drag the image around the window to display the hid­
den areas.
	
I.	Eyedropper tool: The Eyedropper is used to sample color in an image. 
Click anywhere in a photo and the foreground color swatch changes to 
the sample taken with the Eyedropper tool. Press the Alt (Option) key 
and click the Eyedropper tool to sample color for the background color.

L.	Lasso tool: Another selection tool, the Lasso tool is used to select image 
data in a freeform manner.
	
W.	Magic Wand tool: Like the Eyedropper, the Magic Wand tool is used to 
sample color in an image, but it then allows you to travel out from the 
sampled area to automatically select similar pixels in a contiguous or 
noncontiguous area. The contiguity is determined from choices made in 
the Options bar.
	
A.	Quick Selection tool: The Quick Selection tool is similar to the Magic 
Wand tool. It enables you to click and drag to select image data.
	
T.	Horizontal Type tool: This tool is used to add text to a photo.
	
C.	Crop tool: This tool is used for cropping images.

B.	Brush tool: A number of brush tips are available for use with this tool 
that permits you to paint over a photo.
	
F.	Smart Brush tool: This tool is magical by design. You can use the tool to 
brighten or add contrast to areas you specify by “brushing over” the 
image.
	
K.	Paint Bucket tool: The tool is used for filling an area with a foreground 
color.
	
G.	Gradient tool: Use this tool to create gradients.
	
U.	Custom Shape tool: This tool is used to add different shapes to a photo.
	
R.	Blur tool: This tool is helpful to soften edges, particularly when you 
paste new image content in a photo and want to blur the edges of the 
pasted data slightly.
	
O.	Sponge tool: The Sponge tool is used for adding or removing color satu­
ration on a photo.
	
X.	Switch Foreground and Background Colors: This tool switches the fore­
ground and background colors.
	
D.	Default Foreground and Background Colors: Use this tool to return the 
foreground color to default black and the background color to default 
white.

Getting to Know the Tools
Getting to Know the Tools
The tools in the Tools panel can be grouped into several categories. 
Knowing a little about the categories can help you decide where to look first 
when you want to make some edits to a photo.
Using selection tools
The selection tools are used to create selections of pixels in a photo. Unlike 
the objects you’d find in programs like Microsoft PowerPoint, imported 
graphics in Microsoft Word, or artwork you create in illustration programs 
like Adobe Illustrator or CorelDraw, photos are comprised of tiny little pix­
els. In other programs where objects are available, you can just click the 
mouse button with the cursor placed on an object to select it. In Photoshop 
Elements, you need to surround pixels with a selection tool to select a part 
of a photo.
Clicking an object is easy, but selecting pixels requires some careful steps. It 
also requires using the best tool to make a given selection. You can easily 
run into problems when there’s little contrast and color difference between 
the areas you want to select and those areas you want to remain unselected 
in a photo.
Geometric selection tools
The geometric selection tools include the Rectangular Marquee tool and the 
Elliptical Marquee tool. By default, the Rectangular Marquee tool appears 
“on top” in the Tools panel, whereas the Elliptical Marquee tool is kept out 
of view. So how do you get to the hidden tool? Easy. Notice the tiny arrow in 
the lower-right corner on several tools in the Tools panel? When you click 
and hold down the mouse button or right-click, a flyout menu opens, as 
shown in Figure 2-2. In Figure 2-2, we clicked and held the Rectangular 
Marquee tool to open the flyout menu where both the Rectangular Marquee 
tool and the Elliptical Marquee tool appear.
	
We talk about the keyboard short­
cuts earlier in this chapter and men­
tion that you can access the 
Rectangular Marquee tool from a 
shortcut by pressing the M key on 
your keyboard. If you press M and 
then press M again, you select the 
Elliptical Marquee tool. Continually 
pressing the M key on the keyboard 
toggles between the Rectangular and Elliptical Marquee tools.
Figure 2-2: Click and hold down the mouse 
button on the tiny arrow on a tool to open a 
flyout menu.

the Tools
Getting to Know the Tools
Using geometric selection tools is straightforward. Click either the 
Rectangular Marquee tool or the Elliptical Marquee tool and drag on a 
photo to create a rectangle or elliptical shape.
You can also use certain keyboard modifiers to manage selections when 
using a selection tool. Such modifiers include the following:
	
✓	Shift key: If you select a geometric selection tool and then press the 
Shift key while dragging the mouse, your shapes are constrained to a 
square/circle. Also, if you make a selection on a photo and then press 
the Shift key and drag a new selection, you get to add that selection to 
the one you’ve already made. If you have made a selection on a photo 
and don’t use the Shift key when you create a new selection, by default 
the first area you chose becomes deselected.
	
✓	Alt (Option on the Mac) key: When you press the Alt (Option) key and 
drag a geometric selection tool, you draw the selection from the center 
outward. If you already have a selection and then press the Alt (Option) 
key and drag through the first selection, you remove that segment from 
the current selection.
	
✓	Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac): If you already have a selection 
drawn, pressing the Shift key and the Alt (Option) key while dragging 
through that selection creates a new selection at the intersection with 
the original selection.
	
✓	Spacebar: If you press the spacebar while you depress the mouse but­
ton, you can move a selection to another area in a photo without chang­
ing the size of the selection.
Lasso tools
Whereas the geometric selection tools restrict you to rectangles and ellipti­
cal shapes, the Lasso tools are used to create irregular selections — similar 
to freehand drawing with a pencil. The following three types of Lasso tools 
are shown in Figure 2-3:
	
✓	Lasso tool: Click this tool and draw 
on a photo in a freeform fashion to 
select pixels around irregular 
shapes.
	
✓	Magnetic Lasso tool: Click and 
drag around a shape, and Elements 
magically hugs the shape as you 
draw. If you have something like a 
foreground figure you want to 
Figure 2-3: Click the tiny arrow on the Lasso 
tool to open the flyout menu where you find 
three Lasso tools.

42
Getting to Know the Tools
isolate from the background, you can drag this tool around the shape. 
Elements automatically refines the selection to grab the shape you’re 
selecting.
	
✓	Polygonal Lasso tool: This tool behaves like a Polygon tool that requires 
you to click and release the mouse button and then move the cursor to 
click to in another area on the photo. As you keep clicking, the selection 
shape takes the form of a polygon.
Magic Wand tool
	
	 The Magic Wand tool is truly magical. This tool performs a few different 
actions. For example, when you click the tool in an area of a blue sky, the 
area you click is sampled for the selected pixel value. Immediately following 
the mouse click, Elements travels outward in a contiguous area to find pixels 
of similar value and includes them in the selection.
To determine the amount of variance of the pixel values picked up by the 
Magic Wand tool, tweak the Tolerance value in the Options bar, as shown in 
Figure 2-4. You can change the value so the Magic Wand tool selects a wider 
range of pixels (a higher number) or narrower range of pixels (a lower value).
Figure 2-4: The Tolerance value can be changed to select a wider or 
narrower range of pixels.
	
By default, the Tolerance is set to 32, which means that the pixel you click 
produces a selection of 16 pixel values lower than the sample and 16 pixel 
values higher than the sample.
After you create a selection with the Magic Wand tool and you want to add 
another selection to the first selection, press the Shift key and click the 
Magic Wand tool in another area on the photo. If you grab too many pixels, 
you can press the Alt (Option) key and click the area you don’t want 
selected. If you need to refine the selection, you can adjust the Tolerance 
value in the Options bar before clicking the mouse button each time you add 
to or subtract from a selection.

Quick Selection tool
	
	 The Quick Selection tool is similar to the Magic Wand tool. Click the tool in 
an area of a photo, and three check boxes in the Options bar permit you to 
start a new selection, add to the current selection, or subtract from the cur­
rent selection.
In Figure 2-5, we used the Quick Selection tool and clicked a few times in the 
sky area of the photo to create the selection.
Figure 2-5: Click the Quick Selection tool in a few areas with similar 
pixel values to create a selection.
After you have a selection — regardless of the tool you use to create the 
selection — other edits you perform in Elements apply only to the active 
selection. If no selection appears on your photo, edits are made to the entire 
layer.
Using Figure 2-5 as an example, we left the contrast alone on all areas but the 
sky to demonstrate editing a selection. We used the Quick Selection tool to 
select just the sky area and adjusted the contrast to make the sky appear a 
little brighter and with more contrast, as shown in Figure 2-6.

44
Getting to Know the Tools
Figure 2-6: After you create a selection, you can apply edits to just the 
selected area.
Using drawing and painting tools
Drawing and painting tools provide you with a huge number of options for 
adding illustrations, paintings, effects, and modifying brightness and con­
trast in photos. Don’t think of these tools strictly as tools you use to draw 
and paint with. They can also be used for color correction, adjusting con­
trast, and other kinds of brightness enhancements.
Brush tools
Several types of tools are tucked away 
in the Brush tools flyout menu. To view 
all the tools nested there, click and 
hold down the mouse button on the 
Brush tool to open the flyout menu, as 
shown in Figure 2-7.
Tools you have available from the fly­
out menu include the following:
	
✓	Brush tool: The Brush tool supports a number of different brush tips 
you can choose from the Options bar. You use the Brush tool as you 
would use a brush to apply paint to a canvas. You can paint within type 
selections, add color to selected areas, paint in selection channels, and 
more. For more information on selections, see Book IV, Chapter 1. For 
more on type selections, see Book V, Chapter 3. For more on selection 
channels and selection masks, see Book VI, Chapter 4.

the Tools
Getting to Know the Tools
	
✓	Impressionist Brush tool: This tool is designed to paint over your photo 
to make it look like a masterpiece by Renoir or Matisse. You can set vari­
ous options that change the style of the brush strokes. Styles are chosen 
from a drop-down list in the Options bar.
	
✓	Color Replacement tool: As the name suggests, you use this tool to 
paint over areas where you want to replace color.
	
✓	Pencil tool: Like an analog pencil, the Pencil tool enables you to draw 
pencil-type marks on a photo. Also from the Options bar, you have a 
large number of tips to choose from for the pencil drawing shapes.
Smart Brush tools
These two tools, as shown in Figure 2-8, are located in the Smart Brush fly­
out menu:
	
✓	Smart Brush tool: The Smart Brush 
tool is used to paint large areas of 
common pixel values. When you 
drag across a sky or a section of 
greenery, for example, you can 
select the area and apply different 
hue changes from choices in a 
drop-down list from the Options bar.
	
✓	Detail Smart Brush tool: The Detail Smart Brush tool offers similar 
options to the Smart Brush tool, but you can continue to paint in the 
selected area, applying more hue changes to a given region.
Eraser tools
Three different Eraser tools appear in the flyout menu, as shown in Figure 2-9:
	
✓	Eraser tool: The Eraser tool actu­
ally paints a color on a photo. The 
current background color is used 
when you paint with this tool on the 
Background layer. If your photo 
appears on a layer, the Eraser tool 
behaves like a normal eraser, 
removing pixels as you drag across 
a photo.
	
✓	Background Eraser tool: When you open a photo in Edit Full mode, the 
photo appears on a background. Certain objects and type are added in 
layers that appear above the background. Two things happen when you 
make your first edit with this tool: The background is converted to a layer 
and, as you drag the cursor, the image data is removed from the layer.
Figure 2-8: The Smart Brush tools.
Figure 2-9: The Eraser tools.

46
Getting to Know the Tools
	
✓	Magic Eraser tool: The Magic Eraser tool is like a combination of the 
Quick Selection tool and the Eraser tool. When you click and draw on a 
background, the area where you click is selected just as with the Quick 
Selection tool. Also, the background is converted to a layer, and the 
selected area is removed from the photo.
Paint Bucket tool
	
	 The Paint Bucket tool performs two separate actions when you click the tool 
in a photo. First it creates a selection similar to the one you get with the 
Magic Wand tool. After the selection is created, the foreground color fills the 
selected area.
Gradient tool
	
	 The Gradient tool is used to create a gradient on a photo or within a selected 
area. You have a number of choices for the gradient colors from the Options 
bar, or you can add custom colors to create the gradient effect.
Using tools for cloning and healing
The cloning and healing tools are used for effects and when you need to clean 
up images. Cloning involves duplicating an image area to construct image con­
tent that wasn’t in your original photo, whereas healing (in an Elements con­
text) means removing dust, scratches, and imperfections in photos.
Cloning tools
Cloning tools are designed to duplicate 
image area. You can use them for artis­
tic effects, reconstructing photos, 
repairing photos, and enhancing pho­
tos. The two tools (as shown in Figure 
2-10) are
	
✓	Clone Stamp tool: You use this tool by first sampling an area on a photo 
you want to clone. Sampling is performed by placing the cursor over the 
area to clone, pressing the Alt (Option) key, and then clicking the mouse 
button. You then move the cursor to an area where the clone image will 
appear and start painting with the cursor.
	
✓	Pattern Stamp tool: The Pattern Stamp tool is used to apply a pattern you 
select from a list of available patterns from the Options bar. Select a pat­
tern and paint with the cursor to apply the pattern to an area on a photo.
Figure 2-10: The Cloning tools.

Healing brushes
Healing brushes are designed for photo-repair tasks, such as removing dust 
and scratches. The two Healing Brush tools (as shown in Figure 2-11) are
	
✓	Spot Healing Brush tool: The Spot 
Healing Brush tool automatically 
samples neighboring pixels to cor­
rect image imperfections in one 
step. Unlike when you use the 
Healing Brush tool, you don’t need 
to sample an area and then apply 
the brush strokes.
	
✓	Healing Brush tool: You use the Healing Brush tool by first pressing the 
Alt (Option) key and sampling an area you want to use as a source for 
the repair. Then move the cursor to a scratch or other imperfection and 
paint over the area.
Creating text with typographical tools
Four different tools are used to add type to a photo. The tools (as shown in 
Figure 2-12) include
	
✓	Horizontal Type tool: Click the 
cursor and type text horizontally. 
You can choose from various type 
attributes in the Options bar.
	
✓	Vertical Type tool: Use this tool to 
add type vertically on a photo.
	
✓	Horizontal Type Mask tool: The 
Type Mask tools create selection 
outlines of type as you add text 
with the tools. The Horizontal Type Mask tool creates an outline selec­
tion of text horizontally.
	
✓	Vertical Type Mask tool: Use this tool to create a selection mask 
vertically.
Using focus and toning tools
Focus and toning tools are used to edit image brightness, contrast, and 
color. Several tools for making these adjustments are contained within the 
Tools panel.
Red Eye Removal tool
	
	 The Red Eye Removal tool is used to scrub over red eye that commonly 
appears when taking pictures indoors with flash.
Figure 2-11: The Healing Brush tools.
Figure 2-12: The Type tools.

48
Getting to Know the Tools
Toning tools
The toning tools are used to refine edges on pasted content by softening 
edges, sharpening up a photo in areas, and blending areas that might have 
been cloned or pasted into your photos. The tools, as shown in Figure 2-13, 
include
	
✓	Blur tool: Scrub over an area to blur the 
pixels.
	
✓	Sharpen tool: Scrub over an area to sharpen 
an area.
	
✓	Smudge tool: Scrub over an area to blend 
pixels.
Focus tools
Focus tools are used for making edits similar to 
those traditionally used in photo darkrooms. The 
tools, as shown in Figure 2-14, include
	
✓	Sponge tool: Use this tool to scrub over an 
area that you want to either saturate with 
more color or reduce saturation. The choices 
for saturation/desaturation are found in the 
Options bar.
	
✓	Dodge tool: The process of dodging in a traditional darkroom holds 
back light during a print exposure resulting in a lighter image. Use this 
tool to scrub over areas in a photo that you want to lighten up.
	
✓	Burn tool: Burning has the opposite effect as dodging. Use this tool to 
darken some image area.
Creating shapes
Shapes can be used to add artistic elements to photos or mask out some 
areas in a photo.
Cookie Cutter tool
	
	 The Cookie Cutter tool is used to mask out areas in a photo. By default, the 
Heart Cookie Cutter appears in the Tools panel. When you click and drag 
this tool on a photo, all the area outside the heart shape is eliminated from 
the layer. To change the Cookie Cutter shape, choose a different shape 
from the drop-down list in the Options bar.

Shape tools
The Shape tools, as shown in Figure 
2-15, are used to add different shape 
objects to a photo. The tools include
	
✓	Rectangle tool: Used to draw a 
rectangle.
	
✓	Rounded Rectangle tool: Used for 
rectangles with rounded corners.
	
✓	Ellipse tool: Used for drawing 
elliptical shapes.
	
✓	Polygon tool: Used for drawing 
polygonal shapes.
	
✓	Line tool: Used for drawing lines.
	
✓	Custom Shape tool: Used for drawing custom shapes from a choice of 
different shapes identical to those available for the Cookie Cutter tool. 
Again, you make shape choices from a drop-down list in the Options bar.
	
✓	Shape Selection tool: After a shape has been drawn, it appears as an 
object on a photo and can be moved by clicking and dragging with this 
tool.
Viewing, navigating, and sampling tools
Individual tools are used for zooming in and out of photos, moving a photo 
around the Image window, and sampling color.
Eyedropper tool
	
	 The Eyedropper tool samples color and places the sample color in the 
Foreground color swatch. If you press the Alt (Option) key and click the 
Eyedropper tool, the sampled color is placed in the Background color 
swatch.
Hand tool
	
	 Use this tool to move a photo around the Image window.
Zoom tool
	
	 Click this tool to zoom in on a photo. Press the Alt (Option) key to zoom out.
Figure 2-15: The Shape tools.

50
Introducing the Automation Tools
	
You find the same magnifying glass icon for the Zoom tool appearing in dif­
ferent dialog boxes. Whenever you see this tool icon, realize that to zoom 
out, you always need to press the Alt (Option) key and then click the photo.
	
When using any of the painting tools, pressing Alt (Option) gets you the 
Eyedropper tool. You can click to sample color; release the Alt (Option) key 
and you return to the selected painting tool.
Other editing tools
Some miscellaneous tools are contained in the Tools panel to perform addi­
tional edits.
Move tool
	
	 Click and drag with this tool to move the photo on the canvas. This tool is 
particularly helpful when moving layer content if you’re creating layered 
files. If you press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) when you drag, you dupli­
cate the photo.
Crop tool
	
	 This tool is used for cropping images.
Straighten tool
	
	 Use the Straighten tool to straighten crooked images — especially crooked 
scanned images.
Introducing the Automation Tools
Elements offers you some one-click steps to improve your images. Although 
these automated tasks aren’t tools per se, we list them here as tools to sim­
plify the message. In actuality, you use menu commands to automate some 
refinements for your photos.
To observe the automation tools 
available to you, click the Enhance 
menu and look over the first set of 
commands, as shown in Figure 2-16. 
The menu commands beginning 
with Auto in the command name 
indicate that the command has 
something to do with some sort of 
automated function.
Figure 2-16: Some automated tasks in 
Elements are listed as menu commands in 
the Enhance menu.

The automated features you find in the Enhance menu include
	
✓	Auto Smart Fix: Auto Smart Fix is used to add more contrast, adjust 
brightness, and improve color with one menu choice.
	
✓	Auto Levels: The Levels adjustment is used to adjust image brightness. 
Elements takes a guess at the proper brightness and automatically 
boosts the white and black points in your photos to render a more pure 
white and rich black.
	
✓	Auto Contrast: Use this command when contrast is flat and without 
any snap.
	
✓	Auto Color Correction: Auto Color Correction is used to improve color 
in images by removing colorcasts.
	
✓	Auto Sharpen: Use the Auto Sharpen command to sharpen up dull 
images.
	
✓	Auto Red Eye Fix: You use this tool to remove red eye in photos. If you 
have a group shot taken with flash, you can use this command to 
remove red eye in all the subjects.

ne of the most important aspects of working with images in an Editor 
is navigation — knowing how to move around the image (as well as 
between images) and how to use tools and menu commands to help you.
Many tools in Elements enable you to zoom in and out of images, acquire 
information about your photos, and examine them in detail. In this chapter, 
we talk about these tools and clue you in on the best methods to use 
for viewing files in an Editor.
Looking at the Image Window
The first thing you need to know about examining 
an image is how to get it into the Image window. 
The Image window in Edit Full mode is where your 
photos are opened and ready for editing. To open 
an image in Edit Full mode, you have a few options 
available to you.
Like any program, Elements supports choosing File➪
Open. Click the menu command, and a dialog box opens 
enabling you to navigate your hard drive and select a 
photo. Click the Open button, and the photo opens in the 
Image window.
Another method for opening photos is to use the Organizer, where you 
select one or more photos you want to edit. Because we cover some of the 
essentials of using the Organizer in Book II, Chapter 2, we take a look at 
opening a file from the Organizer in Edit Full mode:

54
Looking at the Image Window
	
1.	 Open the Organizer (Windows).
	
	 You can launch Photoshop Elements and click the Organize button in

Looking at the Image Window
Figure 3-1 highlights several important items when you view photos in the 
Image window. Notice the following:
	
✓	The filename appears in the top-left corner of the photo. Double-check 
the name to be certain the photo you want to edit is the correct image.
	
✓	Scroll bars become active when you zoom in on an image. You can click 
the scroll arrows, move the scroll bar, or grab the Hand tool in the Tools 
panel and then drag within the window to move the image.
	
✓	The Magnification box shows you at a glance how much you’ve zoomed 
in or out.
	
✓	The Information box shows you the readout for a particular tidbit of 
information. You can choose what information you want to see in this 
area by choosing one of the options from the pop-up menu, which we 
discuss a bit later in this section.
	
	When you’re working on an image in 
Elements, you always want to know the 
physical image size, the image resolution, 
and the color mode. (We explain these terms 
in more detail in Book III, Chapters 1 and 2.) 
Regardless of which menu option you 
choose from the Information box, you can 
get a quick glimpse at these essential stats 
by clicking the Information box, which dis­
plays a pop-up menu like the one shown in 
Figure 3-2.
	
✓	The Size box enables you to resize the window. Move the cursor to the 
box, and a diagonal line with two opposing arrows appears. When the 
cursor changes, drag in or out to size the window smaller or larger, 
respectively.
	
	You can also resize the window by dragging any of the other corners in 
or out.
	
✓	You can click the Close button (it’s shaped like an X) to close the active 
Image window and keep Elements open. Alternatively, you can use the 
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+W or choose File➪Close to close the active 
window.
After you’re familiar with the overall Image window, we want to introduce 
you to the Information box’s pop-up menu, which enables you to choose the 
type of information you want to view in the Information box. Click the right-
pointing arrow to open the menu, as shown in Figure 3-3.
Figure 3-2: Click the readout 
on the Information box to see 
important information about 
your file.

56
Looking at the Image Window
Here’s the lowdown of the options 
you find on the pop-up menu:
	
✓	Document Sizes: Shows you the 
saved file size.
	
✓	Document Profile: Shows you 
the color profile used with the 
file. For more on color profiles, 
see Book III, Chapter 2.
	
✓	Document Dimensions: Shows 
you the physical size in your 
default unit of measure, such as 
inches. (Refer to Figure 3-3, 
which has the Document Dimensions option selected.)
	
✓	Scratch Sizes: Displays the amount of memory on your hard drive that’s 
consumed by all documents open in Elements. The scratch space is the 
extension of RAM created by a space on your hard drive. For example, 
20M/200M indicates that the open documents consume 20 megabytes 
and that a total of 200 megabytes are available for Elements to edit your 
images. When you add more content to a file, such as new layers, the 
first figure grows while the second figure remains static.
	
✓	Efficiency: Indicates how many operations you’re performing in RAM as 
opposed to using your scratch disk. When the number is 100%, you’re 
working in RAM. When the number drops below 100%, you’re using the 
scratch disk. If you continually work below 100%, it’s a good indication 
that you need to buy more RAM to increase your efficiency.
	
✓	Timing: Indicates the time it took to complete the last operation.
	
✓	Current Tool: Shows the name of the tool selected from the Tools panel.
Don’t worry about trying to understand all these terms. The important thing 
to know is that you can visit the pop-up menu and change the items at will 
during your editing sessions.
	
The Image window is just one small part of the user interface in Elements. To 
get the full picture, imagine that, when a photo opens in Edit Full mode 
within the Elements window, you’re going to see the Image window con­
tained within the workspace as a whole, where you have access to tools, 
panels, and menus to choose from a variety of edit options.
Figure 3-3: From the pop-up menu on the 
Information box, you select commands that 
provide information about your file.

Zooming In and Out of Image Windows
If you select multiple files in the Organizer and choose Edit Full from the 
Editor drop-down list, all the photos open in the Image window. Clicking the 
filename in the Image window brings a photo forward so you can edit it. In 
the workspace interface, you see something like Figure 3-4 when a photo is 
opened in the Image window and several other open photos appear in the 
Project Bin.

Zooming In and Out of Image Windows
Precision goes a long way when making good edits on photos. When you’re 
working carefully on image detail, zoom in on any part of a picture where 
you want to (carefully) apply some fine-tuning. Nothing looks worse than 
photos with obvious edits that were clumsily done without precision.

58
Zooming In and Out of Image Windows
Zooming with keyboard shortcuts
For some quick zooms in and out of photos, you can use keyboard short­
cuts. Here are a few to keep in mind when you need to quickly change the 
zoom level:
	
✓	Ctrl++ (Ô++ on the Mac): Press the Ctrl (Ô) key and the plus (+) key on 
your keyboard and you zoom in on a photo. Keep pressing the same 
keys to continue zooming in. By default, when you press these keys, the 
photo and the Image window zoom together.
	
✓	Ctrl– (Ô– on the Mac): Press the Ctrl (Ô) key and the minus (–) key and 
you zoom out. Again, the Image window zooms along with the photo.
	
✓	Ctrl+Alt++ (Ô+Option++ on the Mac): Press both the Ctrl (Ô) and Alt 
(Option) keys and then press the plus (+) key. The photo zooms in, but 
the Image window stays fixed at one size.
	
✓	Ctrl+Alt+– (Ô+Option+– on the Mac): Press both the Ctrl (Ô) and Alt 
(Option) keys and then press the minus (–) key. The photo zooms out, 
but the Image window stays fixed at one size.
	
✓	Ctrl+0 (Ô+0 on the Mac): Press the Ctrl (Ô) key and then 0 (the zero 
key), and the photo zooms to fit the Image window.
	
✓	Ctrl+spacebar (Ô+spacebar on the Mac): This combination temporarily 
activates the Zoom In tool.
	
✓	Ctrl+Alt+spacebar (Ô+Option+spacebar on the Mac): This combination 
temporarily activates the Zoom Out tool.
Using the Zoom tool
	
	 The Zoom tool is used to zoom in and out of the Image window. You first 
click to select the Zoom tool in the Tools panel and then click the photo to 
zoom in. (To zoom out, press the Alt [Option] key when clicking the Zoom 
tool on the photo.)
	
While working on an image using another tool from the Tools panel, you can 
temporarily access the Zoom tool without clicking it in the Tools panel. 
Press Ctrl+spacebar (Ô+spacebar on the Mac), and the cursor changes to 
the Zoom In tool. To zoom out, press Ctrl+Alt+spacebar (Ô+Option+spacebar 
on the Mac). When you release the keys on the keyboard, you return to the 
tool last selected in the Tools panel.
When you select the Zoom tool in the Tools panel, the Options bar changes 
to reflect choices you can make when zooming views, as shown in Figure 3-5.

Figure 3-5: Click the Zoom tool, and the Options bar changes to provide more options when 
using the tool to zoom views.
The tools available in the Zoom tool Options bar include
	
✓	+/–: The plus and minus icons are used to zoom in and out of a photo in 
the Image window. Click one of the icons to zoom in or out.
	
✓	Percent readout: The number appearing in the text box can be edited to 
zoom to a percent size. Click the down-pointing arrow to open a drop-
down list where you can select from fixed zoom percentages.
	
✓	Resize Window to Fit: When you click the check box, the zoom resizes 
the window to the size of the image or the maximum size to the window.
	
✓	Zoom All Windows: If you have multiple photos open in the Image win­
dow, all photos are zoomed together when you zoom views.
	
✓	Actual Pixels: The ratio is reported in this text box. When the photo is 
shown at 100% size, the ratio reads 1:1. The ratio changes as you change 
the zoom views.
	
✓	Fit Screen: Click the button, and the photo zooms to the maximum view 
to fit the Image window.
	
✓	Print Size: Click this button, and the photo zooms to the size the file will 
be when printed.
Moving the Hand tool
	
	 When you zoom in to a size larger than the Image window can accommo­
date, you see scroll bars appearing on the bottom and right side of the 
photo. You can click and drag scroll bars to see more of the image area, or 
you can use the Hand tool to drag the image around the Image window.
While working with other tools from the Tools panel, you can temporarily 
access the Hand tool by pressing the spacebar. Press the spacebar and drag 
the image; then release the spacebar and you return to the last tool selected 
in the Tools panel.
	
If you’re typing text on an image, you can’t use the spacebar to temporarily 
access the Hand tool. To move the Image window when typing text, click the 
Hand tool in the Tools panel and move the photo. Click the Type tool in the 
Tools panel, click in the text block you started, and continue typing.

Cruising with the Navigator Panel
Cruising with the Navigator Panel
The Navigator panel is a handy tool to keep open when you need to zoom in 
and out of a photo while editing images. All zooming can be performed in 
this panel — and you can keep it open during your editing session!
To open the Navigator panel, choose Window➪Navigator. The panel opens 
as a floating panel, as shown in Figure 3-6.
Figure 3-6: The Navigator panel opens as a floating panel in the 
Image window.
In the top-left corner, you see a readout displaying the current zoom per­
centage. At the top right of the panel is a slider that you can move left to 
zoom out of a photo and right to zoom in on a photo. In the center of the 
panel, you see a view displaying the entire image and a red rectangle dis­
playing the area corresponding to the zoom view in the Image window.
The rectangle in the center of the panel can be moved around the Navigator 
panel just as you use the Hand tool to move around an image. The lower-
right corner is dragged out or in to size the panel larger or smaller, 
respectively.
Click the left chevron, and the panel collapses to a button to minimize the 
panel size.

Using the Grids and Guides
	
You can quickly resize the zoom area in the Navigator panel by pressing the 
Ctrl key (Ô on the Mac) and drawing a rectangle around the area you want 
to zoom.
Using the Grids and Guides
Grids and guides are helpful when adding text to a photo, when working with 
layers, and when working with selections. You can align content to guide­
lines for precise alignment. In addition, you can display rulers along the left 
and top sides of a photo.
To view the grid and guidelines, choose View➪Grid. A nonprinting grid 
appears in your photo, like the one shown in Figure 3-7. To display rulers, 
choose View➪Rulers.
Figure 3-7: To show a grid and rulers, choose the appropriate options 
from the View menu.
To snap layers and objects to the grid and guides, choose View➪Snap To. 
From the submenu, you can choose Guides and Grid. When the objects in 
your image are dragged, selected, or moved, they will snap to the items you 
have selected in the Snap To submenu.

3-10. Here you can make some adjustments for the kind of information you 
want reported in the panel.
Figure 3-9: Click the down-pointing arrow to open the Info 
Palette Options dialog box.
The options you have available in the dialog box include
	
✓	First Color Readout: From the drop-down list, you can choose from 
Grayscale, RGB Color (the default), Web Color, and HSB (hue, saturation, 
and brightness) Color. The choice you make from the menu displays the 
values in the top-left quadrant (first readout) of the Info panel.
	
✓	Second Color Readout: The same choices appear from the drop-down 
list as you find for the First Color Readout. These values are displayed in 
the top-right quadrant (second readout) of the Info panel.
	
✓	Mouse Coordinates: Choose from several different units of measure 
from the Ruler Units drop-down list.

The Content panel provides you with a wealth of opportunity to change 
backgrounds on images and add photo frames, graphics, text, and shapes. 
You have a number of choices for the types of items you want to add to a 
photo (see Figure 3-11), as well as a list of categories you can apply, such as 
backgrounds, frames, graphics, shapes, and so on.
Figure 3-11: A number of different types can be applied as shapes, 
graphics, backgrounds, and frames.

Working with Your Content
To see how this works, assume you want to use one of the backgrounds 
Elements provides you in the Content panel. Follow these steps to begin an 
editing session:
	
1.	 Create a new blank document.
	
	 Open Edit Full mode and choose 
File➪New➪Blank File.
	
2.	 Set the file attributes.
	
	 When the New dialog box opens, 
as shown in Figure 3-12, choose a 
width and height for the file size. In 
our example, we use 445 x 284 pix­
els. Choose a resolution by typing 
a value in the Resolution text box. 
For a demonstration, we use 72 ppi 
(pixels per inch). Select RGB Color 
for the color mode and choose 
Transparent for the Background.
	
3.	 Click OK in the New dialog box.
	
4.	 Open the Content panel.
	
	 Choose Window➪Content to open 
the panel.
	
5.	 From the first drop-down list in 
the Content panel, choose By 
Type. In the second drop-down 
list, choose Backgrounds, as 
shown in Figure 3-13.
	
6.	 Scroll through the list of thumb­
nail images in the Content panel 
and click the background you 
want to use.
	
7.	 Click the Apply button in the 
lower-right corner of the Content 
panel.
	
	 The new background image is 
applied to the background.
After you have a background in place, 
you may want to copy and paste an 
image into your document, add text, 
create multiple layers of images that 
you organize into a design, or perform

a bit about working with layers (covered in Book VI, Chapter 1) and working 
with selection masks (covered in Book VI, Chapter 4).
In Figure 3-14, we added a photo to a background that we selected from 
the backgrounds in the Content panel. For this type of look, we needed to 
feather a selection for the foreground image after moving it to the back­
ground document. For more on selections and feathering selections, check 
out Book IV, Chapters 1 and 2.

Your Preferences

✓	Understanding your preferences
✓	Adjusting the Edit Full mode preferences
✓	Adjusting the Organizer preferences
✓	Working with Bridge preferences
P
hotoshop Elements is a program that accommodates a wide range of 
photographers with a wide range of needs. Not every individual who 
works in the program is likely to work the same way or use the same tools 
consistently. When you think of all the creative options you have for editing 
photos and then consider your hardware advantages and limitations, you 
can begin to design a personal working environment.
Elements understands a user’s need to tailor the program to his or her spe­
cific needs. That’s why it provides you with some methods for creating your 
personal work environment through a set of preferences you can 
adjust to your personal work style.
Understanding Preferences
A Preference setting is an adjustment in a 
Preferences dialog box that has some sort of effect 
on edits you make on pictures, on the behavior of 
tools and menus, and on the controls that affect 
Elements.
When you make a choice in a Preferences dialog box, 
the new setting takes effect after the adjustment is 
made and remains intact until you make a change in the 
Preferences dialog box. Most preferences adjustments you 
make are dynamic — meaning that the change in a setting 
takes place immediately after you click OK in the dialog box. In 
some cases, preference settings are not dynamic — meaning you must quit 
Photoshop Elements and relaunch the program for the new setting to take 
effect.

68
Setting Edit Full Mode Preferences
Preferences are adjusted separately in different dialog boxes for the Editors 
and another dialog box for the Organizer. Whether you use Photoshop 
Elements or any other computer program, it’s a good idea to review the pref­
erences available to you when you first begin working with it. In Elements, 
you want to review and understand all the preference options you have in 
Edit Full mode and in the Organizer.
Setting Edit Full Mode Preferences
Preferences are all contained in the nine panes of the Preferences dialog 
box. By default, when you open Edit Full mode and open the Preferences 
dialog box, the opening pane is the General pane. To open the Preferences 
dialog box, choose Edit➪Preferences➪General (Photoshop Elements➪
Preferences➪General on the Mac). Alternatively, press Ctrl+K (Ô+K on the 
Mac). Using either method opens the Preferences dialog box to the General 
pane, as shown in Figure 4-1.
In Figure 4-1, you see items that are 
common to all preference panes. 
Here’s a quick introduction to what 
these items are and how they work:
	
✓	Panes list: Elements lists all the 
different panes in the 
Preferences dialog box along 
the left side of the dialog box. 
Click an item in the list to make 
the respective pane open on the 
right side of the dialog box. In 
earlier versions of Elements, 
you used a drop-down list to select the different panes.
	
✓	OK: Click OK to accept any changes made in any pane.
	
✓	Cancel: Click Cancel to return to the settings that were in effect when 
you opened a pane. If you hold down the Alt key (Option on the Mac), 
the Cancel button changes to Reset, and clicking that button performs 
the same action as clicking the Reset button.
	
✓	Reset: If you change any settings options, click OK. If you then change 
your mind, just click Reset. This action takes you back to the settings in 
effect when you opened the Preferences dialog box.
	
✓	Prev: Switch to the previous pane.
	
✓	Next: Switch to the next pane. You can also press Ctrl+1 through 9 keys 
(Ô+1 through 9 keys on the Mac) to jump to another pane.

Setting General preferences
The first pane you see when you open the Preferences dialog box is the 
General preferences. In the General preferences pane on the right side of the 
dialog box, you see many check boxes that relate to a variety of behaviors 
for tools and the Elements user interface. The items in this pane (reading left 
to right) include
	
✓	Color Picker: From the menu list, you can choose the Adobe Color 
Picker or your system Color Picker.
	
✓	Step Back/Fwd: The default keyboard shortcut for stepping back is 
Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z). To step forward the default is Ctrl+Y (Ô+Y). You can 
change the shortcuts by choosing other options from the drop-down list.
	
✓	Export Clipboard: When you copy image content in Elements to the 
Clipboard, you can make the content available for other applications by 
selecting this check box.
	
✓	Save Panel Locations: You may want to move panels to new permanent 
locations around the Editor workspace. If this check box isn’t selected, 
the panels revert to the default locations each time you reopen the pro­
gram. If the check box is selected, the panels remain in their new posi­
tion when you open the Editor.
	
✓	Show Tool Tips: Select this check box to show tooltips.
	
✓	Use Shift Key for Tool Switch: When you press the M key on your key­
board, you activate the Rectangular Marquee tool. Press M again and 
you select the Elliptical Marquee tool. If this check box is selected, press 
the Shift key to switch tools while pressing the keystrokes.
	
✓	Beep When Done: Select this check box to play an audio sound when an 
edit is finished.
	
✓	Zoom Resizes Windows: When you zoom in on a picture, the photo 
zooms while the Image window remains fixed in size. If you want the win­
dow to zoom when the picture is zoomed, select this check box.
	
✓	Select Move Tool after Committing Text: When you type text, the Type 
tool is active when you complete your editing. If you want the Move tool 
selected after adding text, select this check box.
	
✓	Relaxed Text Selection: Clicking near text selects the text.
	
✓	Allow Floating Documents in Edit Full Mode: By default, open photos in 
the Image window appear as a nested group with filenames and close 
boxes at the top of the window. You can choose to view documents in a 
more traditional Elements view where multiple images appear as floating 
windows where the photos can be arranged within the Image window. 
When you select this check box and return to the Editor, click the

Setting Edit Full Mode Preferences
Arrange icon to open a drop-down list and choose Float All Windows 
from the menu commands. For more information on using the Arrange 
drop-down list, see Chapter 1 of this minibook.
	
✓	Zoom with Scroll Wheel: Select this check box if you have a mouse with 
a scroll wheel and want to zoom in and out when rotating the wheel.
	
✓	Automatically Launch Adobe Bridge (Mac only): Check this box, and 
Adobe Bridge launches when you launch Elements.
	
✓	Appearance Options: Click either Dark or Light to change the interface 
between a dark gray and white background.
	
	Note that for the purposes of visual clarity, we changed the interface 
color from Dark to Light when capturing all the figures in this chapter.
	
✓	Reset All Warning Dialogs: Many warning dialog boxes have check 
boxes in them which, if selected, let you dismiss the dialog box, safe in 
the knowledge that you’ll never have to bother with that particular dialog 
box again. If, however, you change your mind and want that dialog box 
popping up again, select this button to reset the dialog boxes to defaults.
Setting Saving Files preferences
The Saving Files preferences, as shown in Figure 4-2, relate to options avail­
able for saving files. The settings you have available include
	
✓	On First Save: From a drop-
down list, you can choose 
Always Ask, Ask If Original, or 
Save Over Current file. These 
options apply to the first time 
you edit a photo. On the Mac, 
you have similar options, but 
the menu names vary a bit.
	
✓	Image Previews: Image pre­
views show you thumbnail 
previews of images. Adding a 
preview increases the file size. You can choose to Never Save, Always 
Save, or Ask When Saving. On the Mac, you have an assortment of check 
boxes that offer similar choices.
	
✓	File Extension: Filename extensions can be upper or lowercase. On the 
Mac, you find Append File Extension with choices for Always, Never, and 
Ask When Saving and a check box for Use Lower Case.
	
✓	Prefer Adobe Camera Raw for Supported Raw Files: For Camera Raw 
formats supported by Adobe Camera Raw, you can use Adobe Camera 
Raw as a default.

✓	Ignore Camera Data (EXIF) Profiles: Camera data can be added as meta­
data for photos for cameras that save the data. You can choose to keep 
the data or discard it.
	
✓	Maximize PSD File Compatibility: When you save files from Elements, 
you can save in a format compatible with Adobe Photoshop. For larger 
files, you may want to eliminate the compatibility to reduce the overall 
file size.
	
✓	Recent File List Contains XX Files: The File➪Open Recently Edited File 
submenu lists ten files by default. You can reduce the number of files 
appearing in the list (as low as zero) or increase the number to a maxi­
mum of 30 files.
Setting Performance preferences
Check out the Performance preferences pane, as shown in Figure 4-3, for 
history states and memory settings, such as scratch disk settings. (See the 
sidebar “What’s a scratch disk?” in this chapter for more on scratch disks.) 
The options include
	
✓	Let Photoshop Elements Use: 
This item deals with the amount 
of memory allocated to 
Elements. You can type values 
in the text box to change the 
memory allocation.
	
✓	History States: You can undo 
edits up to 50 undos, defined in 
the History States text box by 
default. This value can be edited 
to add more undos or to reduce 
the number. The more you add 
to the text box, the more memory is required in Elements.
	
✓	Cache Levels: Some operations you perform are cached in memory so 
that they can be quickly accessed again. You can edit the text box to 
increase or decrease the cache levels.
	
✓	Scratch Disks: If you have external hard drives attached to your com­
puter, you can extend the scratch disk space to external drives.
	
	Don’t use USB 1.1 external hard drives or other drives that have connec­
tions slower than USB 2 or FireWire. Using slower drives slows the per­
formance of Elements.

Setting Display & Cursors preferences
The Display & Cursors preferences are shown in Figure 4-4. These choices 
offer options for how certain tool cursors are displayed and how you view 
the Crop tool when you’re cropping images.
Your choices include
	
✓	Show Transition Effects: When 
the check box is selected, you 
see transition effects when view­
ing photos in a slideshow.
	
✓	Painting Cursors: Your choices 
here include the following:
	
•	 Standard: This setting shows 
a tool icon, such as the 
Lasso tool or the Brush tool, 
for when you edit an image.
	
•	 Precise: This setting changes the tool cursor to a crosshair for pre­
cise markings.
	
•	 Normal Brush Tip: Displays a 50% tip on a brush for the cursor shape.
	
•	 Full Size Brush Tip: Shows the tool cursor at the full size of a brush tip.
	
•	 Show Crosshair in Brush Tip: Shows the tool cursor with a crosshair 
inside the tip.
	
✓	Other Cursors: Choose Standard that displays an icon of the tool being 
used or Precise that displays a crosshair for a more precise detail image 
of the cursor.
What’s a scratch disk?
Assume that you have 100 megabytes (MB) 
of free RAM (your internal computer memory) 
and you want to work on a picture that con­
sumes 200MB of hard disk space. Elements 
needs to load all 200MB of the file into RAM. 
Therefore, an auxiliary source of RAM is need­
ed in order for you to work on the image; Ele­
ments uses your hard drive. When a hard drive 
is used as an extension of RAM, this source is 
a scratch disk.
If you have more than one hard drive connect­
ed to your computer, you can instruct Elements 
to use all hard drives, and you can select the 
order of the hard drives that Elements uses for 
your extension of RAM. All disks and media 
sources appear in a list as 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.

✓	Crop Tool settings: The following Crop Tool options are found in this 
section:
	
•	 Use Shield: If you select this option and then use the Crop tool, the 
inside area defining the crop region shows the photo at the normal 
appearance and the area outside the crop region appears with a 
shield, making it easier to see what will be eliminated and what will 
be retained when the photo is cropped.
	
•	 Shield Color: You can change the color of the Crop tool shield by 
making choices in the drop-down color palette.
	
•	 Opacity: The shield is semitransparent by default. You can change 
the opacity of the shield to make it more opaque or transparent by 
editing the text box or choosing options from the drop-down list.
Setting Transparency preferences
The Transparency preferences are 
shown in Figure 4-5. Using these 
settings requires an understanding 
of how Elements represents trans­
parency. Imagine painting a portrait 
on a piece of clear acetate. The 
area you paint is opaque, and the 
area surrounding the portrait is 
transparent — invisible, in other 
words. To display transparency in 
Elements, you need some method 
to make transparent areas visible. 
To accomplish that, open the Transparency preferences and make choices 
for how transparency is displayed in your 2-D Elements environment.
The settings available to you include
	
✓	Grid Size: The grid you see in the image in the top-right corner of the 
Transparency preferences pane displays the default settings for the grid 
size and color. You can change the grid size to None, Small, Medium, or 
Large.
	
✓	Grid Colors: From the drop-down list, you can choose from preset col­
ors to display the transparency.
	
✓	First transparency background color: Click the swatch and you can 
make a custom color choice for one set of the pattern squares.
	
✓	Second transparency background color: Click the second color swatch 
and you can choose a custom color for the second set of pattern 
squares.

Units & Rulers preferences
The Units & Rulers preferences, as shown in Figure 4-6, let you specify set­
tings for ruler units, column guides, and document preset resolutions. Your 
choices include
	
✓	Rulers: From the drop-down 
list, choose the unit of measure 
you want to use for your 
display.
	
✓	Type: From the drop-down list, 
choose the units you want to 
use when dealing with text.
	
✓	Print Sizes: From the drop-
down list, choose the units you 
want to work with when printing 
photos.
	
✓	Width: You can set up columns to create a layout in Elements. This item 
deals with the width you want to specify for the column width.
	
✓	Gutter: The gutter is normally the space between columns in a publica­
tion. Define the amount of space you want to have appear between the 
columns when you add columns to a layout.
	
✓	Print Resolution: When you create a new document, the print resolution 
default is determined by this setting.
	
✓	Screen Resolution: A new document’s screen resolution is determined 
by this setting.
	
✓	Photo Project Units: When creating projects, such as photo calendars, 
photo books, and so on, you can specify units of measure for the book 
sizes from choices in the drop-down list.
Setting Guides & Grid preferences
The Guides & Grid preferences, as shown in Figure 4-7, offer options for 
guide colors and styles, and gridline color, divisions, and subdivisions. A 
grid shows you nonprinting horizontal and vertical lines. You use a grid to 
align objects, type, and other elements. You can snap items to the gridlines 
to make aligning objects much easier.
Your choices for Guides & Grid preferences include
	
✓	Color: Guides & Grids are displayed with colored lines. You can change 
line color by choosing Custom or a preset color from the drop-down list.

✓	Subdivisions: Between each 
major subdivision, you can 
define the number of subdivision lines by typing a value in the text box.
Setting Plug-ins preferences
The Plug-ins preferences pane, as 
shown in Figure 4-8, isn’t much to 
look at. It contains a single option 
for selecting an additional plug-ins 
folder for storing third-party utilities 
to work with Elements. If you have 
third-party utilities, though, it’s a 
great help. Just select the check box 
and click the Choose button to 
locate another folder for storing 
your third-party plug-ins.
Setting Type preferences
The Type preferences, as shown in Figure 4-9, provide options for setting 
text attributes. You have options for using different quote marks, showing 
Asian character options, showing font names in English, and previewing font 
sizes. The full listing follows:
	
✓	Use Smart Quotes: So-called 
smart quotes — the typographi­
cally correct quotation marks 
found in most printed matter — 
are used instead of straight 
quotes when this option is 
selected.
	
✓	Show Asian Text Options: 
Options for text using Asian 
character sets are shown when 
this is selected.

G
etting photos into Elements, as well as orga­
nizing and managing your photos, is the sub­
ject of this book. We start by talking about how 
you acquire photos from cameras, card readers, 
and scanners, and how you can use wizards to 
make the process easier. For Windows users, we 
talk about using the Organizer and all the features 
the Organizer has for managing and editing your 
photos in Chapter 2. For Macintosh users, we talk 
about managing and editing photos using Adobe 
Bridge in Chapter 3.

A
fter you install Photoshop Elements, the first thing you 
want to do is open some photos. It stands to reason 
that, before you can jump into all the editing opportuni­
ties you have with the program, you need to have 
something to work with.
You may have digital camera photos still on a mem­
ory card, or you may have copied files to your com­
puter. You might have a photo print you want to 
scan, or you may want to get a photo off your cell 
phone. Regardless of where you have photos stored, 
you want to get them into Elements and start working 
on them.
In this chapter, we talk about getting your files into the 
Organizer (Windows) or Adobe Bridge (Mac) and opening 
them in an Editor. After you have your files in one workspace or 
another, you have a number of different options for sorting, finding, and 
arranging photos in the Organizer (Bridge). First, however, we look at 
acquiring images from a variety of sources and check out how to open them 
in an Editor. (Look over Book II, Chapter 2 if you just can’t wait to find out 
more on working with the Organizer or Book II, Chapter 3 for Adobe Bridge.)

Getting Images from Your Camera
Getting Images from Your Camera
When you work with Elements, you most frequently use one of two work­
spaces, as we describe in Book I, Chapter 1 — the Organizer (or Adobe 
Bridge) or the Editor. The Organizer (Windows) or Adobe Bridge (Mac) is 
frequently used as your first stop in editing photos. Unless you have an 
image you want to edit in Edit Full mode and, therefore, open it immediately 
in the Editor, your typical first step is to look over a collection of photos 
you’ve taken with a digital camera or imported using a scanner. Therefore, 
when we talk about getting images from your camera, we’re pointing you to 
the Organizer or Bridge workspace.
To load images from your camera in the Organizer window or Adobe Bridge, 
you open the Organizer (Bridge) and use a cable connected to your camera 
and your computer. Most digital cameras come with USB cables that can be 
connected to both camera and computer.
	
The process for acquiring images from a camera and a card reader are the 
same, and the Organizer (Bridge) has a single menu command you use to 
acquire your photos. To find out how to acquire the images, look over the 
next section.
Getting Images from Your Card Reader
Almost all cameras use memory cards to store photos. After shooting some 
images, you have a choice of either grabbing those images directly from the 
camera and shunting them to your computer via a USB or FireWire cable, or 
you can remove the memory card itself from the camera and place it in a 
card reader hooked up to your computer using one of the same cables.
Both methods — a direct hookup or a connection to a card reader — afford 
you an opportunity to load your photos in the Elements Organizer or Adobe 
Bridge. To add photos to the Organizer or Adobe Bridge, do the following:
	
1.	 Either hook up your camera to your computer via a USB/FireWire 
cable, hook up a card reader via a cable, or insert a card if you have a 
built-in reader on your computer and insert the memory card in the 
reader.
	
	 Use the cable supported by your camera/card reader.
	
2.	 Cancel the AutoPlay Wizard (Windows). If iPhoto or Image Capture 
opens on the Mac, close the application.
	
	 When you hook up your camera or card reader, the AutoPlay Wizard 
opens. Click Cancel in the wizard to proceed.

ard opens when you choose to get photos from within the Organizer. At 
the top of the wizard, you find a drop-down list that displays your hard 
drive and a source, such as a camera or card reader, attached to your 
computer. Choose a source, as shown in Figure 1-1. On the Mac, choose a 
source drive from the Source pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 1-2.
	Figure 1-1: Choose a source from the Get Photos and Videos From

6.	 Get the photos.
	
	 After you choose a camera or card reader, the Downloader appears with 
the Get Photos button active, as shown in Figure 1-3. Click Get Photos 
and leave the other settings at the defaults.
	
7.	 Wait for the Downloader to complete downloading all images before 
continuing.
	
	 A progress bar displays the download progress, as shown in Figure 1-4. If 
you have many photos on your memory card, it may take a little time to 
complete the download. Be patient and wait for the download to finish.

the images in Full Edit or Quick Fix mode. See “Opening an Image in Edit Full 
Mode,” later in this chapter.
Using the Photoshop Elements Downloader
The Adobe Photoshop Elements 8.0 – Photo Downloader Wizard (as shown 
in Figure 1-5) has a number of settings you can use when getting photos from 
a media source. Among the options you have are
	
✓	Location: Click the Browse button to navigate your hard drive and select 
a target folder for saving the downloaded files. The directory path is 
shown in the wizard. In the advanced options shown later in Figure 1-5, 
you can create subfolders to further organize your photos.
	
✓	Rename Files: You can choose to preserve the filenames created by your 
camera or add an extension or custom name for the files. Open the drop-
down list and make a choice for the naming convention you want to use.
	
✓	Delete options: You can copy images to your hard drive and retain the 
files on the media card, or you can delete the files after copying them. 
Choose an option from the drop-down list appearing below the Import 
into Album check box.
	
✓	Advanced Options: If it’s in the Advanced Options section of the 
Advanced dialog box, it must be doubly advanced, right? Items listed 
here include
	
•	 Automatically Fix Red Eyes: Red-eye removal is applied to all images 
where Elements detects a red-eye problem.
	
•	 Automatically Suggest Photo Stacks: Images with similar content 
can be stacked so that only a single-image thumbnail appears in the 
Organizer. You can unstack the photos at any time by clicking a 
stacked group. Checking this box automatically suggests photo 
stacks that you can confirm or deny.

Elements 8.0 – Photo Downloader Wizard automatically downloads 
images when a media card is inserted in a card reader or when your 
camera is connected to your computer. You can establish download 
options from the Organizer preferences (see Book I, Chapter 4 for more 
on customizing preferences).
Using the AutoPlay Wizard (Windows)
Earlier in this chapter, we cancelled the AutoPlay Wizard when we added 
photos in the Organizer. At times, you may want to use the AutoPlay Wizard 
to copy files to your computer.
To use the AutoPlay Wizard, con­
nect your camera or card reader to 
your computer or insert a CD-ROM. 
The AutoPlay Wizard opens by 
default. In the AutoPlay Wizard 
shown in Figure 1-6, you have the 
following options:
	
✓	Pictures Options: In the list 
below Pictures Options, you 
find applications that can open 
images on the stored media 
device. If you want to open files 
in Elements, click the Organize 
and Edit link adjacent to the 
Elements icon.
	
✓	General Options: If you want to 
browse the media storage 
device, click the Open Folder to 
View Files link. The folder where 
your images are stored opens

Scanning Images
Scanning Images
Scanners connect through the same ports as cameras and card readers. 
Most of today’s scanners use either USB or FireWire. Almost all low-end 
scanners sold now are USB devices.
Even the lowest-end scanners provide 16-bit scans that help you get a little 
more data in the shadows and highlights. Like a digital camera, a scanner’s 
price is normally in proportion to its quality.
Preparing before you scan
Just as you’d clean a lens on a digital camera and set various menu selec­
tions before clicking the shutter button, you should prepare a few things 
ahead of time before scanning:
	
✓	Connect the scanner properly. Make sure that you have all connections 
made to your computer according to the user manual that came with 
your scanner. If you just purchased a scanner, check for any lock bolts 
or tape and remove them according to the instructions.
	
✓	Clean the scanner platen. Use a lint-free cloth and some glass cleaner 
(applied to the cloth) to remove all dust and particles on the glass. The 
more dust particles you remove, the easier it is to edit your image in 
Elements.
	
✓	Clean the source material. Be certain that the print or film you want to 
scan is free of dust and spots.
	
	If you have old negatives that are dirty or that have water spots or 
debris that you can’t remove with a cloth and film cleaner, soak the film 
in photo flo (a liquid you can purchase at a photo retailer). Be certain 
that your hands are clean and then run the filmstrip between two fingers 
to remove the excess liquid. Turn on your shower full force with hot 
water only and hang film nearby to dry it. Remove the film when it’s dry, 
and you should see a surprisingly clean filmstrip compared to your 
soiled original.
	
✓	Get to know your scanner software. When you scan in Elements, the 
software supplied with your scanner takes charge, and you use the 
options in this software before the image scan finally drops into an 
Elements Image window.
	
✓	Prepare the artwork. If you plan on scanning pages in a book or pam­
phlet, remove the pages or try to make photocopies so that the piece 
you scan lies flat on the scanner platen. Make sure that you observe

Images
Scanning Images
copyright laws if you’re scanning printed works. For faxes and photo­
copies, try to improve originals by recopying them on a photocopier by 
using darker settings.
	
✓	Find the scanner’s sweet spot. Every scanner has an area where you 
can acquire the best scans. This area is often called the sweet spot. To 
find the scanner’s sweet spot, scan a blank piece of paper. The sweet 
spot is the brightest area on the resultant scan. Other areas should be 
darker. The sweet spot is most often in the upper-left quadrant, the 
lower-right quadrant, or the middle of the page. Note the area and plan 
to place your source material within this area when scanning pictures.
Understanding image requirements
All scanning software provides you with options for determining resolution 
and color mode before you start a new scan. You should decide what output 
you intend to use and scan originals at target resolutions designed to accom­
modate a given output. For example
	
✓	Scan the artwork or photo at the size and resolution for the final output. 
If you have a 3-x-5 photo that needs to be 1.5 x 2.5 inches on a Web page, 
scan the original with a 50-percent reduction in size at 72 ppi (pixels per 
inch). (See Book III, Chapter 1 for information about resizing images.)
	
✓	Size images with the scanner software. If you have a 4-x-6 photo that 
needs to be output for prepress and commercial printing at 8 x 12 
inches, scan the photo at 4 x 6 inches at 600 ppi (enough to size to 200 
percent for a 300 dpi [dots per inch] image).
	
✓	Scan properly for line art. Line art is 1-bit black and white only — 
something like a black-and-white illustration. When you print line art on 
laser printers or prepare files for commercial printing, the line art reso­
lution should match the device resolution. For example, printing to a 600 
dpi laser printer requires 600 ppi for a 1-bit line-art image. When you’re 
printing to an image setter at a print shop, or it’s going directly to plate 
or press, the resolution should be 1200 dpi.
	
✓	Scan grayscale images in color. In some cases, it doesn’t matter, but 
with some images and scanners, you can get better results by scanning 
in RGB (red, green, blue) color and converting to grayscale by using the 
Hue/Saturation dialog box or the Convert to Black and White dialog box, 
as we explain in Book III, Chapter 2.
	
✓	Scan in high bit depths. If your scanner is capable of scanning in 16 or 
32 bit, by all means, scan at the higher bit depths to capture the most 
data. See Book III, Chapter 2 for more information about working with 
higher-bit images.

Scanning Images
Using scanner plug-ins
Generally, when you install your scanner software, a standalone application 
and a plug-in are installed to control the scanning process. Plug-ins are 
designed to work inside other software programs such as Photoshop 
Elements. When you’re using the plug-in, you can stay right in Elements to 
do all your scanning. Here’s how it works:
	
1.	 After installing a new scanner and the accompanying software, launch 
Elements and then open the Organizer by clicking Organize in the 
Welcome screen (Windows) or click Import from Scanner on the 
Welcome screen (Mac).
	
2.	 From the Organizer, open the Preferences dialog box by pressing 
Ctrl+K (Windows). On the Mac, choose your scanner from the Import 
drop-down menu that appears in the Select Import Source dialog box.
	
3.	 Click Scanner in the left column and adjust the Scanner preferences, 
as we describe in Book I, Chapter 4 (Windows).
When the Preferences dialog box sees your scanner, you know that the con­
nection is properly set up and you’re ready to scan. On the Mac, when you 
choose your scanner from the Import drop-down list, you’re ready to scan 
when Elements recognizes the scanner. Assuming all your connections are 
properly set up, here’s how to complete your scan:
	
1.	 To open the scanner software from within Elements, choose File➪Get 
Photos➪From Scanner. On the Mac, launch Elements and click Import 
from Scanner in the Welcome screen.
	
	 You must be in the Organizer window (Windows) to access this menu 
command.
	
	 Elements may churn a bit, but eventually your scanner software appears 
atop the Organizer window (Windows) or Elements window (Mac), as 
shown in Figure 1-7. The window is the scanner software provided by 
your scanner manufacturer. (Your window looks different from the one 
in Figure 1-7 unless you use the same scanner we use.) Regardless of 
which software you use, you should have similar options for creating a 
preview; selecting resolution, color mode, and image size; scaling; and 
other options.
	
2.	 Adjust the options according to your output requirements and the rec­
ommendations made by your scanner manufacturer.
	
3.	 When everything is ready to go, click the Scan button.
	
	 The final image drops into an Elements Image window.

loads on top of the Elements workspace.
Scanning many photos at a time
If you have several photos to scan, 
you can lay them out on the scanner 
platen and perform a single scan to 
acquire all images in one pass. 
Arrange the photos to scan on the 
glass and set up all the options in 
the scanner window for your 
intended output. When you scan 
multiple images, they form a single 
scan, as you can see in Figure 1-8.
After you scan multiple images, 
Elements makes it easy for you to 
separate each image into its own 
Image window, where you can save 
the images as separate files. Choose 
Image➪Divide Scanned Photos to 
make Elements magically open each 
image in a separate window while your original scan remains intact. The 
images are neatly tucked away in the Project Bin where you can select them 
for editing, as shown in Figure 1-9.
Figure 1-8: You can scan multiple images with 
one pass.

Phoning In Your Images
With newer cell phones, you have several ways you can get photos from 
your phone to your computer. Elements doesn’t have a menu command to 
import cell phone images directly. You first need to copy photos to your 
computer or connect your phone via a USB cable to your computer and from 
there, you can import them into the Organizer or open them in an Editor.
Here’s what you find with cell phones and connection options:
	
✓	Cable connection: If your phone comes with a USB port, you can con­
nect your phone to your computer and copy images from the phone’s 
memory card or hard drive to your computer. Your computer should 
see the cell phone as an external device. In some cases, you may need to 
load software that was provided by your cell phone developer.
	
✓	Bluetooth: If your computer and your phone are equipped with 
Bluetooth, you can use your computer’s Bluetooth interface to browse 
for a device to connect to your phone. On your phone, you accept the 
connection invitation and after you’re connected, you can perform a 
wireless transfer of your files.

Getting Files from Folders
	
✓	E-mail: Phones equipped with Internet connection options and e-mail 
provide you with the ability to e-mail photos to your desktop e-mail cli­
ent. After these are e-mailed to your client, you can save the files to a 
target folder.
After you copy photos to your hard drive, you can get the photos in the 
Organizer, as we explain in Book II, Chapter 2, or open them directly in an 
Editor.
Getting Files from Folders
We’ve covered several different options you might use to copy files to your 
hard drive. Whether you’ve opened a folder from a media device or copied 
cell phone images to your computer, after they are on your computer’s hard 
drive, you want to work with them in Elements.
To load files copied to your hard drive into the Organizer on Windows, do 
the following:
	
1.	 Copy files to a folder.
	
	 You can organize photos into separate folders on your hard drive, nest 
folders, or copy a bunch of photos to a single folder. When you use mul­
tiple folders, you repeat the steps here to import each folder’s images 
into the Organizer. If you nest folders, you can get files from a parent 
folder and all subfolders.
	
2.	 Choose File➪Get Photos and Videos➪From Files and Folders.
	
	 You can import a single file or a collection of images with this command. 
When you choose the menu command, the Get Photos and Videos from 
Files and Folders dialog box opens, as shown earlier in Figure 1-1.
	
3.	 Select images to import.
	
	 If you want to import all photos within a given folder, click any file in the 
list and then press Ctrl+A to select all. Alternatively, you can click and 
Ctrl-click to select files individually in a noncontiguous order or click 
and Shift-click to select photos in a contiguous order.
	
4.	 Specify your Fix Red Eyes and Photo Stacks options.
	
	 If you want to automatically correct red-eye problems or create photo 
stacks, check the check boxes respectively for these options.
	
5.	 Get the photos.
	
	 Click the Get Photos button and wait for Elements to complete the 
import process. Your photos appear in a new Organizer window and 
you’re ready to apply edits in either the Organizer or an Editor.

Opening an Image in Edit Full Mode
Opening an Image in Edit Full Mode
You might have a single photo you want to edit without adding it to the 
Organizer or viewing it in Adobe Bridge. Perhaps you just want to apply 
some edits to an image you have on a media source or on your hard drive 
and then send it off via e-mail or share the photo using one of several sup­
ported sharing services.
If this is the case, you can bypass the Organizer and start in Edit Full mode. 
To open an image in Edit Full mode, do the following:
	
1.	 Launch Photoshop Elements.
	
2.	 Choose File➪Open.
	
3.	 (Optional) If you want to search for photos saved within a given for­
mat, open the All Formats drop-down list (Format pop-up menu on the 
Mac) and choose the format for a file you want to open.
	
	 Selecting a format narrows down a collection of photos so that only files 
saved within the selected format are displayed. For example, if you have 
Camera Raw, JPEG, and TIFF images in a folder and you want to open 
only a JPEG file, you can select JPEG (*.JPG, *.JPEG, *.JPE) from the All 
Formats drop-down list (or JPEG from the Format pop-up menu [Mac]). 
Doing so displays only files saved in the format you choose from the 
drop-down list or pop-up menu.
	
	 If you’re not sure what format the file you want to open is, leave the 
default choice from the menu at All Formats.
	
4.	 From the list of photo files displayed, click the photo you want to 
open.
	
5.	 Click the Open button in the Open dialog box.
	
	 The file opens in Edit Full mode.
Using Open As (Windows)
You may have a photo that was saved as a JPEG, TIFF, or some other format 
without a file extension or an incorrect file extension for the file type. You 
may not see the file listed in the Open dialog box, but you know it’s there, 
and you know what format the file is. If this is the case, you can try to use 
the Open As command.
Choose File➪Open As, and the Open As dialog box opens providing you the 
same options as the Open dialog box. Choose a format from the Open As 
drop-down list and click the file you want to open. Click Open and see if it 
works. In some cases, Elements may not recognize the file if it’s damaged. In 
other cases, you may be able to resurrect a damaged file.

Opening an Image in Edit Full Mode
	
One advantage to using the Open As command is opening images in Camera 
Raw. You can open any photo (JPEG, TIFF, and so on) in the Camera Raw 
converter even if your camera didn’t originally capture the photo in Camera 
Raw. We cover all you want to know about Camera Raw and why this would 
be an advantage when editing photos in Book III, Chapter 3.
Opening recently edited files
A quick way to open recently edited files is to choose File➪Open Recently 
Edited File. The submenu lists these files. The number of files appearing in the 
submenu is determined in Preferences, as we explain in Book I, Chapter 4.
If the file you want to open appears in the submenu, click the filename in the 
list and the file opens in Edit Full mode. On the Mac, a recent file list appears 
on the Welcome screen when you first launch Elements.
	
The Recently Edited Files list also appears in the Organizer. If you want to 
open a recently edited image while in the Organizer workspace, choose 
File➪Open Recently Edited File and select the file you want to open. The file 
opens in Edit Full mode.
Placing files
You may have a piece of artwork you want to add to a photo. The artwork 
can be of any file type you find for the supported formats that you can open 
in Elements. Quite often you may find a vector art drawing or a PDF file that 
contains the artwork you want to import; however, any of the supported for­
mats can be used for placing content on a photo.
To place content in Elements, use the Place command as follows:
	
1.	 Open a photo in Edit Full mode.
	
	 You must start with a file open in Edit Full mode in order to use the 
Place command.
	
2.	 Choose File➪Place.
	
	 The Place dialog box opens. This dialog box has the same options you 
find in the Open dialog box.
	
3.	 Select a file to place.
	
	 Your file can be an image format, EPS or other type of vector format, or 
PDF or any other file type you see listed in the Files of Type drop-down 
list (Windows) or Format pop-up menu (Mac). Click the file you want to 
place.
	
4.	 Click Place.
	
	 When you place an image, you see handles around the image that can be 
used for sizing the image, as shown in Figure 1-10.

102
Creating a New Image
Figure 1-10: A placed image.
	
5.	 Size and position the image.
	
	 If you import a vector art image or PDF file containing vector art, you 
can drag the corner handles out to size up the image without losing 
image quality. Press the Shift key when sizing the image to constrain 
proportions and press the Enter (Return) key to accept your resizing 
edits. After you press the Enter (Return) key, the image data are raster­
ized and lose image quality if you decide to upsize the image. Click the 
image and move it to the desired position. (For more information on vec­
tor versus raster art and upsizing images, see Book III, Chapter 1.)
Creating a New Image
You may want to start with a fresh, 
new canvas where you can copy and 
paste content from other pictures, 
place objects, add shapes, and/or 
add text to create your own scene. 
To begin the process, you create a 
new image.
In either Edit Full mode or the 
Organizer, choose File➪New➪Blank 
File. If you start in the Organizer, 
Elements switches workspaces from 
the Organizer to Edit Full mode and 
the New dialog box opens, as shown 
in Figure 1-11.

Saving Files
The options you have here are covered thoroughly in Book III, Chapter 2. 
Look over that chapter for details on the options you have for creating new, 
blank files.
Converting Clipboard Data to Images
Whatever you copy to the Clipboard in Elements can be converted to an 
image. If you copy data from somewhere else, such as text in Office applica­
tions, objects in Office applications, illustration programs, and other types 
of applications, the data on the Clipboard can be converted to a new 
Elements image.
After copying data from another application, choose File➪New➪Image from 
Clipboard. The data converted to a new document in Elements creates a new 
file at 72 ppi.
	
If you want to convert something like a vector object to an Elements file with 
a resolution higher than 72 ppi, create a new document in Elements at the 
desired resolution and then choose File➪Place. When you accept the edits 
by pressing the Enter (Return) key, the data are rasterized at the resolution 
of the open file.
Saving Files
Photoshop Elements files can be saved in a variety of different formats. 
Some format types require you to convert a color mode before the format 
can be used. Therefore, a relationship exists between file formats and saving 
files. Additionally, bit depths in images also relate to the kinds of file formats 
you can use in saving files.
Before you go too far in Elements, you should really familiarize yourself with 
the file formats you use and the conversions you need to make in order to 
save in one format or another (as we explain in Book III, Chapters 1 and 2). If 
you do nothing to an image in terms of converting modes or changing bit 
depth, you can save a file after editing in the same format in which the file 
was opened. In many circumstances, you open an image and prepare it for 
some form of output, which requires more thought about the kind of file for­
mat you use in saving the file.
Using the Save/Save As dialog box
In most any program, the Save (or Save As) dialog box is a familiar place 
where you make some choices about the file to be saved. With Save As, you 
can save a duplicate copy of your image or a modified copy and retain the 
original file.

104
Saving Files
To use the Save (or Save As) dialog box, choose File➪Save for files to be 
saved the first time, or choose File➪Save As for any file. Either command 
opens a dialog box for you.
The standard navigational tools you find in any Save dialog box appear in 
the Elements Save/Save As dialog box. Here are some standard options you 
find in the Elements Save/Save As dialog box:
	
✓	Filename (Windows) Save As (Mac): This item is common to all Save 
dialog boxes. Type a name for your file in the text box.
	
✓	Format: From the drop-down list, select file formats. We explain the for­
mats supported by Elements in Book III, Chapter 2.
A few options make the Photoshop Elements Save/Save As dialog box differ­
ent from other Save dialog boxes you might be accustomed to using. The 
Save Options area in the Save As dialog box provides these choices:
	
✓	Include in the Organizer (Windows): If you want the file added to the 
Organizer, select this check box.
	
✓	Save in Version Set with Original (Windows): You can edit images 
and save a version of your image, but only in Edit Quick mode. When 
you save the file from Edit Quick mode, this check box is active. Select 
the box, and a version of the original is saved and appears in the 
Organizer.
	
✓	Color: Check the box for the ICC (International Color Consortium) 
Profile. Depending on which profile you’re using, the option appears for 
sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998). When the check box is selected, the profile 
is embedded in the image. See Book III, Chapter 2 for more information 
on profiles.
	
✓	Thumbnail (Windows): If you save a file with a thumbnail, you can see a 
miniature representation of your image when viewing it in folders or on 
the desktop. If you select Ask When Saving in the Saving Files prefer­
ences, the check box can be enabled or disabled. If you’re choosing an 
option for Never Save or Always Save in the Preferences dialog box, this 
box is enabled or disabled for you and is grayed out. You need to return 
to the Preferences dialog box if you want to change the option.
	
✓	Use Lower Case Extension (Windows): File extensions give you a clue to 
which file format was used when a file was saved. Elements automati­
cally adds the extension to the filename for you. Your choices are to use 
uppercase or lowercase letters for the extension name. Select the check 
box for Use Lower Case Extension for lowercase or deselect the check 
box if you want to use uppercase characters in the filename.

Batch Processing Files
Saving files for the Web
You save files for Web hosting in a different dialog box than you do when 
you’re saving files for other output. Choose File➪Save for Web; the Save for 
Web dialog box opens. In Book III, Chapter 2, we explain all you need to 
know about how to use the Save for Web dialog box.
Batch Processing Files
Elements provides you with some automated features for processing 
batches of photos. You can export multiple files from one format to another 
file format, and you can export files changing file formats if you like. In addi­
tion, you have a limited number of other editing tasks you can automate.
The method you use and the features you want depend on whether you 
choose Export in the Organizer or Process Files in Edit Full mode.
Exporting files
When you open JPEG images and save back to a JPEG format, you’re adding 
file compression to the saved images. JPEG is a lossy file format, which 
means that you lose image data when you save in this format. If you edit a 
JPEG image many times and save back to JPEG format each time, you contin­
ually lose more image data.
In some cases, you may want to convert multiple JPEG files to a file format 
that doesn’t toss away data. You can use formats such as Photoshop PSD or 
TIFF, and no data are thrown away when you save the file.
For a single instance when you want to convert a JPEG image to a PSD or 
TIFF image, you can open the file in Elements and choose File➪Save As. 
From the Files of Type drop-down list (Windows) or Format pop-up menu 
(Mac), choose the desired format.
If you have multiple files and you want to convert the file type more effi­
ciently, you can process a folder of files using a single command. To use a 
batch process type of action to convert multiple files from one format to 
another, do the following:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer (Windows).
	
	 You should have a collection of photos in the Organizer saved as JPEG 
or some other format that you want to convert to a newer format.
	
2.	 Select files in the Organizer you want to convert.
	
	 Click a file and press Shift and click the last file in a group or click and 
press Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) and click all the photos you want to convert.

3.	 Choose File➪Export as New Files.
	
	 The Export New Files dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 1-12.
	
4.	 Choose an Export file format.
	
	 If converting JPEG files, you 
might want to choose PSD for 
the file format. This format does 
not compress files.
	
5.	 Choose a Size and Quality.
	
	 Choose Original if you want to 
maintain the same image dimen­
sions and resolution. If you want 
a different size for the saved 
images, make a choice from the 
Photo Size drop-down list.
	
6.	 Click the Browse button.
	
	 You can target a folder on your 
hard drive if you don’t want to 
use the default folder shown in 
the Export New Files dialog box.
	
7.	 Choose filenames.
	
	 You can save the files to a new 
folder with the same names 
without overwriting the original files or save to the same folder adding a 
common base name. If you click Common Base Name, you can type a 
base name in the text box. Type something like Hawaii, for example, and 
the files are saved as Hawaii001, Hawaii002, and so on.
	
8.	 Click Add/Remove to add additional files or remove some from the 
list.
	
	 If you want to add more files, click the Add

thumbnails, and if you find photos you want 
to remove, click the respective photo and 
click the Remove minus (–) icon.
	
9.	 Click the Export button.
	
	 A progress bar is displayed in a dialog box, 
as shown in Figure 1-13. Wait for the prog­
ress to complete before moving on.

Processing multiple files
The Export as New Files command in the Organizer (Windows) or Process 
Multiple Files dialog (Mac) provides you a batch process for converting file 
formats with a rather limited set of options. For much more power and the 
ability to make several enhancements to the new files saved, you can use the 
Process Multiple Files command in Edit Full mode.
You need to switch from the 
Organizer to Edit Full mode to take 
advantage of the additional features 
provided in the Process Multiple 
Files dialog box. In Edit Full mode, 
choose Edit➪Process Multiple Files 
(Windows) or File➪Process Multiple 
Files (Mac) to open the dialog box 
shown in Figure 1-14.
As you can see in Figure 1-14, you 
have far more options available to 
you in the Process Multiple Files 
dialog box than you have in the 
Export New Files dialog box shown 
earlier in Figure 1-12.
Among some of the additional 
choices are
	
✓	Image attributes: In the left pane of the dialog box, you have all the attri­
bute options you would have if you were exporting files. Make choices 
for file-naming conventions, locations for saved files, image size and res­
olution, and file formats.
	
✓	Quick Fix: From the options shown in the Quick Fix panel on the right, 
you can check the boxes for the image enhancements you want to make. 
For a complete description of these items, see Book VIII, Chapter 1.
	
✓	Labels: You can apply watermarks, custom labels, and choose a variety 
of font attributes for text added to the new saved files.
Select a folder of files and make your choices in the Process Multiple Files 
dialog box and click OK. Your files are converted and saved to the target 
folder you identify in the dialog box.
Adding Pages
You can add pages to images for use when creating projects, such as slide 
shows. Any pages you add to a document can be blank, new pages of the 
Figure 1-14: The Process Multiple Files 
dialog box.

Adding Pages
exact same size and resolution as the current image or a duplicate of the 
current image added as an additional page.
To add new pages to a file, do the following:
	
1.	 Open a photo in Edit Full mode.
	
2.	 Open a context menu on the 
image thumbnail in the Project 
Bin or open the Edit menu and 
choose Add Blank Page, as shown 
in Figure 1-15.
	
	 Alternatively, you can choose 
Edit➪Add Blank Page.
	
	 The Add Blank Page menu com­
mand adds a blank page to the cur­
rent open document. If you want to 
copy the content in the file and 
duplicate it on a new page, choose 
Add Page Using Current Layout 
from either menu command.
	
3.	 Click OK.
	
	 An application alert dialog box 
opens, informing you that the file 
must be saved as a Photo Creation 
Project (PSE) file type. Click OK, 
and your new page is added.
	
4.	 Save the file.
	
	 Choose File➪Save As, and the Save 
As dialog box defaults to a PSE file 
format. Locate a target folder and 
click Save.
Obviously, when adding new pages to an image and saving as a Photo 
Creation Project, you want to add content to the new page and perhaps add 
additional pages. We show you more on creating projects in Book IX, 
Chapter 1. For now, be aware that you can add additional pages to photos 
and that the files must be saved as PSE files in order to preserve the addi­
tional pages.

Closing and Quitting
Closing and Quitting
It’s important to understand a few things when closing files and quitting 
Elements. When you are in Edit Full mode and have an image open in the 
Image window, you can close the image without quitting the Edit Full mode 
workspace. Click the X button in the top-right corner of the Image window or 
the red button in the top-left corner (Mac) and the open file is closed.
If you click the X (red button) in the top-right (top-left on a Mac) corner of 
the Edit Full mode workspace, you quit Edit Full mode. Alternatively, you 
can press Ctrl+K (Ô+K on the Mac) or press Alt+F4 (Windows).
If you happen to have the Organizer and an Editor open and you quit one 
workspace, the other workspace remains open. For example, if the Organizer 
and Edit Full mode are both open and you quit the Organizer, Edit Full mode 
remains open and vice versa.
If you make an edit on a photo in Edit Full mode and decide to quit Edit Full 
mode, Elements prompts you to save the file before quitting.
If you also have the Welcome screen open as well as the Organizer and an 
Editor, quitting both the Organizer and the Editor doesn’t get you out of 
Elements. The Welcome screen can remain open even though you’ve quit 
the workspaces.
To completely shut down Elements, take a look at the status bar (Windows) 
or the Dock (Mac). If you see one workspace open, click the respective item 
in the status bar (Dock) and then choose File➪Quit, press Ctrl+Q (Ô+Q on 
the Mac), or click the Close button.

✓	Locating and viewing images
✓	Sorting files
✓	Searching files
✓	Managing files
✓	Creating albums
✓	Showing and hiding files
✓	Backing up files
I
n Book II, Chapter 1, we talk about getting images from cameras, card 
readers, scanners, and other media sources. For good measure, we also 
talk about opening a file directly in an Editor, copying files to your hard 
drive, and loading up images in Elements.
To continue the story, be aware that any files loaded 
in Elements on Windows end up in the Organizer. 
Furthermore, when you add files to the Organizer, you 
have many options for managing files, sorting them, 
searching for files, tagging files with keywords, 
examining file properties, and using a host of differ­
ent project-creation opportunities.
This chapter covers many of the features you find 
only when working in the Organizer on a Windows 
machine. It also offers tips on how best to manage 
photo collections in an Organizer catalog, and takes a 
closer look at some tasks you can perform that are 
unique to the Organizer. (The alternative for Mac users 
is working with Adobe Bridge. If you’re a Mac user, look 
over Book II, Chapter 3, where we cover Adobe Bridge 
in depth.)

The default Organizer view — the view you’re most likely to use in all your 
Elements work sessions — looks a lot like a slide sorter. The Organizer pro­
vides an efficient way to access the photos you want to open in one of the 
Editors. Just double-click a photo in the Organizer, and you see the image 
zoom in size to fill an Organizer window. You can carefully examine the 
photo to be certain that it’s the one you want, and then just select an Editor 
to use — whether from the Editor drop-down list on the Menu bar, from the 
context menu you open on the image in the Organizer window, or by clicking 
the Fix button in the Panel Bin.
In addition to the default view in the Organizer, you can also examine your 
pictures one by one in a slide show or side by side to compare them.
Adding files to the default Organizer view
The first step to working in the Organizer involves loading up images in a 
new catalog. By default, when you launch Elements and open the Organizer, 
you arrive at an empty default catalog.
	
Before you can do anything in the Organizer, you have to import images into 
a catalog. As we explain in Book II, Chapter 1, you can copy images to your 
computer via a drag-and-drop method, using the AutoPlay Wizard, or by 
using the Photoshop Elements Downloader Wizard.
Presuming you copied photos to your hard drive (as we explain in Book II, 
Chapter 1), here’s how you add them to the default empty catalog:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer.
	
	 Launch Elements and click Organize in the Welcome screen.
	
2.	 In the Organizer, choose File➪Get Photos and Videos➪From Files and 
Folders.
	
	 The Get Photos and Videos from Files and Folders dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 2-1.
	
3.	 From the View menu (circled in Figure 2-1), choose Large icons (or 
Medium icons).
	
	 In Large icon (or Medium icon) view, thumbnail images of most of your 
files appear in a scrollable list large enough to see some detail. (Note: 
You might not see Camera Raw files and some files saved in different for­
mats.) This view makes it easy to locate the files you want to add to the 
Organizer. For example, if you want to load only Camera Raw images, 
you can easily see them represented as icons, rather than as image 
previews.

4.	 Select files to add to the Organizer window.
	
	 Click a thumbnail and use either the Shift key or the Ctrl key to select 
additional photos. When you hold down Shift and click, all photos 
between the first thumbnail and the thumbnail you Shift-click are 
selected. When you Ctrl-click, you can select additional noncontiguous 
photos.
	
5.	 Click Get Photos to add the selected photos to the Organizer window.
	
	 Photos are imported into your default catalog.
	
6.	 View all photos.
	
	 After you import your photos, a dialog box opens (as shown in Figure 2-2), 
displaying information related to viewing your photos in the Organizer. 
Click OK and then click the Show All button in the Shortcuts bar to view 
the photos in the catalog.
Adding additional photos to a catalog
To add additional photos to a catalog, use the same File➪Get Photos and 
Videos➪From Files and Folders or you can choose to get photos from a cam­
era, a card reader, or a scanner (as we explain in Book II, Chapter 1).
You follow the same steps to import photos as you did when you created 
your new catalog. When you arrive at the same dialog box shown in Figure 2-1, 
the new imported images are displayed in a new Organizer view. After click­
ing OK, you click Show All to see the new imported images and the original 
files you imported into your default catalog.

114

Figure 2-2: Click OK and then click Show All.
Importing images to a new catalog
If you have lots of pictures — perhaps numbering in the hundreds or even 
thousands — you can still add each and every one of these photos to a single 
catalog. However, doing so slows down the performance in the Organizer and 
makes searching for photos a bit more difficult. A better option for you when 
dealing with large numbers of photos is to create separate catalogs.
You might have a number of photos that were taken at some event or special 
occasion and want to create a separate new catalog to manage just those 
files. Here’s how you go about creating a second catalog:
	
1.	 In the Organizer, choose 
File➪Catalog.
	
	 The Catalog Manager opens, as 
shown in Figure 2-3.
	
2.	 In the Catalogs section of the 
Catalog Manager, choose an 
accessibility level.
	
	 By default, your catalog is 
accessible to all users. If you 
have several logons for different 
users, all users can access the 
catalog.
	
	 If you want to make the catalog 
accessible only to you and not 
to others logging on to your

Catalog Manager.

computer, click the Catalogs Accessible by the Current User radio 
button.
	
3.	 Choose a location.
	
	 By default, the catalog is saved to a default location. If you want to save 
the catalog to the folder of your choice, click the Custom Location radio 
button and click the Browse button to select a folder on your hard drive 
in which you want to store the catalog.
	
4.	 Click New in the top-right corner of the Catalog Manager.
	
	 The Enter a Name for the New Catalog dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 2-4.
	
5.	 Type a name for your new catalog.
	
	 If you want to import free music 
files for later use when creating 
slide shows, check the check 
box shown in Figure 2-4.
	
6.	 Click OK.
	
	 You return to the Catalog 
Manager, and the new catalog is 
listed below your default 
catalog.
	
7.	 Click OK in the Catalog 
Manager.
	
	 The new catalog opens in the Organizer with an empty screen. From 
here, you can add photos by importing images, using any of the methods 
described in Book II, Chapter 1.
Importing legacy catalogs
If you’re a Photoshop Elements user 
of a previous version of Elements, 
you may want to convert an older 
catalog created in an earlier version 
of Elements to one that can be rec­
ognized by Elements 8.
To convert a legacy catalog, open 
the Catalog Manager by selecting 
File➪Catalog. Click the catalog you 
want to convert and then click the 
Convert button in the Catalog Manager to open the Convert Catalog dialog 
box. Click the Show Previously Converted Catalogs check box, and the list 
expands to display older catalogs, as shown in Figure 2-5. Additionally, you 
can click the Find More Catalogs button and locate catalogs saved to your 
hard drive.
Figure 2-4: Type a name for the new catalog 
and click OK.
Figure 2-5: Check Show Previously Converted 
Catalogs to expand the list.

Click Done, and the catalogs are converted and displayed in the Catalog 
Manager.
Switching catalogs
As you create new catalogs, you’ll want to switch back and forth between 
catalogs to view photos in the Organizer. If you make a catalog active, of 
course, you see only the photos 
you’ve previously added to that 
particular catalog.
To switch catalogs, choose 
File➪Catalog to open the Catalog 
Manager. From the list of catalogs 
that appears, click the catalog 
you want to open, as shown in 
Figure 2-6.
When the catalog you want to open 
is selected, click the Open button. 
The photos added to the catalog 
appear in the Organizer, and you’re 
ready to edit the pictures.
Viewing images in 
the Organizer
The Organizer window shows you all files that have been added to a particu­
lar catalog. You can change the types of views you see in the Organizer to 
facilitate finding photos and managing them. 
Thumbnail view
When you open the Organizer, the default view is a Thumbnail display. Your 
photos, videos, projects, audio files, and so on are shown as mini-images or 
icons that can be adjusted to different sizes. In the Shortcuts bar, you can 
move a slider left to create smaller thumbnail views or right to create larger 
thumbnail views in the Organizer window.
The icon on the left side of the slider (as shown in Figure 2-7) takes you to a 
default view of small thumbnail images in the Organizer window. The icon on 
the far right shows you a single image in the Organizer window. Move the 
slider left to see thumbnails at smaller sizes; move it to the right to view 
thumbnails at larger sizes.
If you double-click a photo, the image thumbnail zooms into view as a single 
photo in the Organizer. To return to a view where you see smaller thumb­
nails, click the icon to the left of the slider.

The Thumbnail display is one of 
many options for viewing photos 
and other files in the Organizer. A 
quick glance at the Display drop-

views available to you, as shown in 
Figure 2-8.
Import Batch view
Below the default option for 
Thumbnail View, you find Import 
Batch. (To get there, open the 
Display menu and then select 
Import Batch, or press Ctrl+Alt+2.) The display in the Organizer keeps the 
view set to thumbnails, but the order of your files changes to a date order 
(according to the date you imported the files with the Get Photos and Videos 
command, as discussed in Book II, Chapter 1). This view can be helpful if 
you want to organize images according to the batch you imported on a 
given day.

Folder Location view
What’s nifty about the Folder Location display is that you can peruse your 
hard drive for all files and folders while you remain in the Organizer window. 
Just select Folder Location from the Display menu or press Ctrl+Alt+3 to 
make an Explorer sidebar show you your hard drive(s), network locations, 
and offline media.
Choosing Folder Location changes the view to something approaching what 
you see in Figure 2-9. When you want to poke around in a folder, right-click 
and select Reveal in Explorer from the context menu that appears. A Windows 
Explorer window opens on top of the Organizer window and shows you all 
the files contained in that folder.
Figure 2-9: Choose Folder Location from the Display menu and then 
right-click to open a context menu.
When you find an image you want to edit, right-click and choose Open 
With➪Adobe Photoshop Elements 8.0 (Editor). The image then opens in Edit 
Full mode in Elements.
	
When you want more of the screen window dedicated to seeing the files in 
the Organizer, hide the Panel Bin by clicking the separator bar. One click on 
the tiny right-pointing arrow on the separator bar hides the panel. Click the

arrow on a collapsed panel to reopen that panel. In Figure 2-9, you see the 
Organizer window with the Panel Bin hidden, so that more thumbnail images 
appear in the Organizer window.
Date view
Choose Date View (Ctrl+Alt+D) from the Display menu to change your 
Organizer window to a calendar showing you the dates on which your 
images were shot. The date information is derived from metadata imported 
with your images that are recorded by your camera. (For more information 
on metadata, see “Searching metadata” later in this chapter.)
If you shoot many pictures on a given 
date, the images are stacked on the cal­
endar for that date. In the Project Bin 
in Edit Full mode, you find arrows that 
are used to scroll the stacked images 
left or right. Notice that a number 
appears in the lower-left corner of the 
image thumbnail in view. In Figure 2-10, 
for example, the numbers appear as 5 
of 6 — meaning that on April 13, 2008 
(the date at the top of the thumbnail), 
six photos were taken, and the current 
view is the fifth photo in the stacked 
order.
To return to the default Organizer 
thumbnail display, click the binoculars 
icon or press Ctrl+Alt+O (the letter O, 
not zero).
Show Map
How would you like to see a visual display of where your photos were taken 
geographically? Photoshop Elements 8 provides you the answer with Yahoo! 
Maps and an option for placing your photos on a world map.
To open Yahoo! Maps in Elements, open the Display menu in the Shortcuts 
bar and choose Show Map. The Map panel on the left side of the Organizer 
window opens, as shown in Figure 2-11.
	
You must have an Internet connection active on your computer to work with 
Yahoo! Maps.
Figure 2-10: The Project Bin shows a 
thumbnail view of a photo with scroll arrows 
and numbers.

Viewing Images in the Organizer
Figure 2-11: Choose Show Map from the Display menu to open 
Yahoo! Maps.
To map the location of photos shown in the Organizer to Yahoo! Maps, you 
can choose from a couple different options:
	
✓	Select photos in the Organizer and drag them to a map location on the 
map in the Map panel.
	
✓	Select photos in the Organizer and right-click the selected photos. 
From the menu options, choose Place on Map. In the dialog box that 
opens, type a city name and click the Find button. If more than one city 
is reported in the dialog box, click the city name you want to use for the 
mapped photos.
To move around the map, place the cursor inside the Yahoo! Map panel and 
drag the map with the Hand tool within the panel window. If you go too far 
left, don’t worry; the Asian, Indian, and Eastern European countries are 
found by dragging right across the Atlantic and eastward. Dragging left stops 
somewhere around the International Date Line; if you live in Singapore, you 
have to keep dragging to the right to find your country.
Zooming in the Map panel is handled by the tools you see at the bottom of 
the map. Use the Zoom In tool to find cities and road maps in a detailed 
view. Use the Zoom Out tool after you find the location you want to use.
After you add photos to the map, you can view the images by clicking the 
red pin placed on the map whenever you add photos to a location. Click the 
red pin to open a pop-up window that shows a thumbnail view of the current 
photo, along with smaller photos, in a slide organizer below the primary

Figure 2-12). Click the left and right 
arrows in the pop-up window to 
scroll the slides. Clicking the cur­
rent image thumbnail in the pop-up 
window opens the image in a Slide 
Show view (there’s more about Slide 
Show views in the next section).
In the Map panel, you can choose 
from several display options in the 
drop-down list on the bottom-right 
side of the panel. Choose from the 
default Map (the standard carto­
graphic type), a Hybrid map (the 
topographic type), or Satellite map. 
Choose Satellite to locate Uncle 
Jeremy’s house, where the last fam­
ily reunion took place (and where 
you shot all those wonderful 
pictures).
To close the Map panel, return to 
the Display menu and choose Show 
Map again. The panel collapses, and 
you’re back to the standard 
Organizer view.
	
When you view panels in Elements, drag the vertical separator bar on a 
panel to widen the panel or reduce the panel size. Look for the arrowhead 
on the vertical bar separating the Organizer window from a panel, and click 
and drag left or right to change panel sizes.
Viewing images in a slide show
Are you ready for some exciting viewing in Photoshop Elements? Using an 
alternative view of your Organizer files, you can see your pictures in a self-
running slide show (in Full Screen view), complete with transition effects 
and background music. Full Screen view takes you to a slide show view. For 
the purposes of clarity, think of Full Screen view and viewing a slide show as 
the same thing. Full-screen viewing temporarily hides the Elements tools and 
menus, and gives you the most viewing area on your monitor to see your 
pictures.
	
Viewing files in Slide Show mode can be helpful for quickly previewing the 
files you want to edit for all kinds of output, as well as for previewing photos 
you might use in an exported slide show (which we explain in Book IX, 
Chapter 1).
Figure 2-12: Click a red pin to open a pop-up 
window that shows the images placed on 
the map.

Taking a quick view of the slide show
To set up your slide show and/or enter Full Screen view, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer.
	
2.	 Select images that you want to see in a slide show or use all the 
images in the Organizer for your slide show.
	
	 If no images are selected when you enter Full Screen view, all photos in 
the Organizer window are shown in Full Screen view.
	
3.	 Choose Display➪View Photos in Full Screen (or press the F11 key).
	
	 In previous versions of Elements, a dialog box opened where you could 
choose preferences for full-screen viewing. Now, in Elements 8, you 
jump right into the full-screen view with some panels and tools dis­
played, as shown in Figure 2-13.
Figure 2-13: Pressing F11 takes you to Full Screen view.
	
4.	 Click the arrow keys at the bottom of the screen to move forward and 
back through the slides. Click a slide, and the main window displays 
the slide.
	
	 You can also click the Toggle Film Strip icon (the first icon on the left at 
the bottom of the screen) to show a filmstrip on the right side of the 
screen displaying your slides, as shown in Figure 2-13. 
	
5.	 Press the Esc key on your keyboard to return to the Organizer 
window.

You can also open Full Screen view by clicking the View, Edit, Organize in 
Full Screen icon in the Shortcuts bar. Look for the monitor icon with a right 
arrow.
Working with the toolbar
While in Full Screen view, you can play the slide show and move back and 
forth between slides. These options and more are available to you on the 
toolbar that opens when you first enter full-screen viewing. After the toolbar 
disappears, you can bring it back by simply moving the mouse.

selected. Four different transition effects are displayed in the dialog box. 
You can preview a transition effect by placing the cursor over one of the 
images. When you find an effect you like, click the image and click OK to 
change the transition.
	
✓	Toggle Properties panel: Click this tool to open the Properties dialog 
box, where property attributes are assigned.
	
✓	Show all controls (right arrow): Click the tiny right-pointing arrow at 
the far right side of the toolbar, and the toolbar expands to reveal some 
additional tools. Here you find a large display icon used for showing the 
Full Screen default view. The double monitors icon to the right is used to 
show two slides adjacent to each other in the slide show.
	
The main thing to keep in mind is that the Full Screen view is a temporary 
viewing option you have in Elements. It’s not permanent. You use the view 
for a quick display method on your computer when you want to show off 
some photos to family and friends. You do have more permanent options for 
saving files as slide shows that can be shared with other users, as we explain 
in Book IX, Chapter 2.
Setting Full Screen view prefer­
ences
When you open photos in Full 
Screen view, the Preferences dialog 
box is not immediately shown, as 
was the case in earlier versions of 
Elements. You need to click the 
Open Settings Dialog button in the 
toolbar (the icon shape that appears 
as a wrench). When you click the 
icon, the Full Screen View Options 
dialog box opens, as shown in

Sorting Images
Considering all the Photoshop Elements modes and workspaces you have 
become familiar with, you need a consistent starting place to handle all your 
editing tasks. Think of the Organizer as New York’s Grand Central Station. 
From this central location, you can take the Long Island Railroad to any 
destination you desire. In Elements terms, rather than head out to Port 
Washington, you travel to a specific editing mode. Rather than go to the 
Hamptons, you journey through all the creation areas. In short, the 
Organizer is the central depot on the Photoshop Elements map.
In addition to serving as a tool to navigate to other workspaces, the 
Organizer is a management tool you can use to organize, sort, search, and 
describe photos with identity information. In terms of sorting and organizing 
files, Elements provides many different options; we cover them all in the fol­
lowing sections.

126
Using Search Options
Using sort commands
One quick way to sort images in the Organizer is 
to use the menu in the Shortcuts bar in the 
Organizer window for date sorting. Two options 
are available to you, as shown in Figure 2-17.
The sorting options available to you from the 
menu are
	
✓	Date (Newest First): Select this option to 
view images according to the date you took 
the photos, beginning with the most recent date.
	
✓	Date (Oldest First): This option displays photos in chronological order, 
starting with the oldest file.
	
You can also view files according to the Import Batch date and Folder 
Locations, as we mention in the section “Viewing Images in the Organizer,” 
earlier in this chapter.
Sorting media types
Photos can also be sorted according 
to media type. Elements supports 
viewing photos, video files, audio 
files, projects you create in 
Elements, and Adobe PDF files. To 
select different media types, choose 
View➪Media Types, and when a sub­
menu appears, choose one of the 
options it offers for viewing different 
media types (as shown in Figure 
2-18). Select a menu item from the 
submenu to make all media types 
that match the menu command 
appear in the Organizer window.
Using Search Options
The Organizer’s Find menu is devoted entirely to searching for photos. From 
the Find menu, you can locate photos in albums, catalogs, and the Organizer 
window according to a variety of different search criteria.
To use the commands on the Find menu, you need to have photos loaded in 
the Organizer window or create albums or catalogs, which we explain in this 
chapter. The categories described in the following sections can be searched 
in the Organizer.
Figure 2-17: You can sort files 
quickly in Date Ascending or 
Date Descending order.

Using Search Options
Searching by date
When you have a number of different files in an Organizer window including 
photos shot on different dates, you can narrow your search to find photos — 
and all other types of files supported by Elements — through a date search.
	
Be careful: The date is taken from the camera metadata, and if a date isn’t 
available from the camera data, the date is taken from the file’s creation 
date. The creation date is not likely to be the date you shot the photo.
To search files by date, follow these steps:
	
1.	 If you haven’t yet added photos to your default catalog, open files in 
the Organizer by first choosing File➪Get Photos and then choosing a 
submenu command for acquiring files.
	
	 To open files stored on your hard drive, choose the From Files and 
Folders submenu command.
	
2.	 To select a date range, choose Find➪Set Date Range.
	
	 The Set Date Range dialog box 
(as shown in Figure 2-19) 
opens.
	
3.	 Specify the dates.
	
	 Type a year in the Start Date 
Year text box. Select the month 
and day from the Month and 
Day drop-down lists. Repeat the 
same selections for the End 
Date.
	
4.	 Click OK.
	
	 The thumbnails shown in the Organizer window include only files cre­
ated within the specified date range.
Searching for untagged items
You can tag files with a number of different criteria, as we explain later in 
this chapter (in the section “Organizing and Managing in the Organizer”). 
When tags are added to images, you can sort files according to tag labels. 
We cover sorting by tag labels later in this chapter, too. For now, take a look 
at the Find menu and notice the Untagged Items command. If you want to 
add tags to certain items, and so want to show only the untagged files, 
choose Find➪Untagged Items or press Ctrl+Shift+Q. Elements displays all 
files without tags in the Organizer window.
Figure 2-19: Open the Set Date Range dialog 
box and specify the start and end dates.

128
Using Search Options
Searching albums
You can create albums (as we describe 
later in this chapter in the section 
“Creating Albums”) and then select an 
album in the Albums panel (contained 
in the Organize panel), as shown in 
Figure 2-20. Selecting an album is like 
having a first level of sorting. You can 
then search by date or other sort 
options (discussed in the preceding 
and following sections) to narrow your 
choices.
Searching captions 
and notes
When captions or notes are added to 
files, you can search for the caption 
name, contents of a note, or both. 
Before you can search for 
captions and notes, though, you have 
to add them to your images.
Adding captions and notes
A way to identify your files beyond the tagging capabilities, which we dis­
cuss in the section “Organizing and Managing in the Organizer,” later in this 
chapter, is to add captions and notes. When you add a caption or note, you 
can search captions or notes by choosing the Find➪By Caption or Note menu 
command. Captions and notes are also helpful when you create different 
keyword tags — such as those for slide presentations and photo albums — 
by using the Create panel (as we explain in Book IX, Chapter 1).
Text captions are easy to create. Although you can select a thumbnail image 
in the Organizer window and choose Edit➪Add Caption, a better way is to 
use the Properties panel. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	 To open the Properties panel, select a thumbnail image in the 
Organizer, right-click it, and choose Show Properties from the context 
menu that appears.
	
	 Alternatively, you can choose Window➪Properties or press Alt+Enter. In 
either case, the Properties panel opens, as shown in Figure 2-21.
	
2.	 Type a caption by adding text to the Caption text box.
	
3.	 Type text in the Notes area on the panel to add a note.
	
	 That’s all there is to it. You can also record audio notes about an image.
Figure 2-20: Select an album and then use 
other search options to narrow your search.

Searching the captions 
and notes content
After you create captions and notes, 
you can search for the words contained 
in the descriptions.
To search for caption names and notes 
in your open catalog, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer.
	
	 You should have images in a cata­
log and have files identified with 
captions and notes.
	
2.	 Choose Find➪By Caption or Note.
	
	 The Find by Caption or Note 
dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 2-22.
	
	 Options in the dialog box are as 
follows:
	
•	 Find Items with Caption or Note: 
In the text box, type the words 
you want to locate.
	
•	 Match Only the Beginning of 
Words in Captions and Notes: 
Click this radio button when 
you know that your caption or 
note begins with words that 
you type into the text box.
	
•	 Match Any Part of Any Word in Captions or Notes: Click this radio but­
ton if you’re not sure whether the text typed in the box is used at the 
beginning of a caption or note, or whether it’s contained in the cap­
tion’s name or the note’s text.
	
3.	 Click OK.
	
	 Your results appear in the Organizer window.
Searching by history
Elements keeps track of what you do with your photos, such as printing, 
e-mailing, sharing, and performing various other tasks. If you want to base a 
search for files on the file history, choose Find➪By History, as shown in 
Figure 2-23. If you select options on the By History submenu, you see files 
that meet your criteria by date.
Figure 2-21: The Properties panel.
Figure 2-22: Choose Find➪By Caption 
or Note to open the dialog box in which 
search criteria for captions and notes are 
specified.

Using Search Options
Your options in the By History sub­
menu include
	
✓	Imported On: Choose this 
option and you can select a date 
when files were imported into 
the current catalog. When you 
make this choice in the sub­
menu, a dialog box opens where 
you can select the import date 
and click OK. (All options in the 
submenu display a dialog box 
similar to Figure 2-24 when the 
respective menu command is 
selected.)
	
✓	E-Mailed To: Click this menu 
item, and the list in Figure 2-24 
changes to reflect all the photos 
you e-mailed from within 
Elements.
	
✓	Printed On: This option dis­
plays all files printed in a date 
order for the print date and 
time.
	
✓	Exported On: This choice dis­
plays files that were exported 
from the current catalog.
	
✓	Ordered Online: This item dis­
plays files that were submitted 
for an online service.
	
✓	Shared Online: This choice displays files that were shared online.
	
✓	Used in Projects: This option displays files that were used in projects. 
See Book IX, Chapter 1 for all the different types of projects you can cre­
ate in Elements.
Searching metadata
Metadata includes not only the information about your images that’s sup­
plied by digital cameras, but also the custom data you can add to a file. 
Metadata contains descriptions of the image, including such data as your 
camera name, the camera settings you used to take a picture, copyright 
information, and much more.
Figure 2-23: Choose Find➪By History to search 
files according to the editing history.
Figure 2-24: Choosing a By History submenu 
command displays a dialog box where you can

Using Search Options
Searching metadata is easy. Just choose Find➪By Details (Metadata) in the 
Organizer. The Find by Details (Metadata) dialog box opens. The first two 
columns in the dialog box offer a number of different choices for search cri­
teria and for options based on the criteria. In the third column, you type 
search criteria into a text box to specify exactly what you want to search for. 
You can click the plus button to add new lines to your search criteria, as 
shown in Figure 2-25. Clicking the minus button deletes a line.
Figure 2-25: Choose Find➪By Details (Metadata) in the 
Organizer to open the dialog box in which you specify 
metadata.
Finding people
In earlier versions of Elements, you had a menu command that permitted 
you to search through a catalog and find faces. Any photo where a person’s 
face could easily be detected was displayed in the Organizer as a sorted 
group.
	
Elements 8 has a new menu command for finding people. Choose Find➪Find 
People and Elements. Auto Analyzer kicks in and searches through a catalog 
to find photos of people. 
When the Organizer window displays a photo with people, the faces are 
highlighted with a white border. If Elements misses a person, you can click 
the Add a Person button, as we did for the photo shown in Figure 2-26. The 
border shown with handles is a new frame added by clicking the Add a 
Person button.
As you move the mouse cursor over individual borders, a pop-up text box 
opens with the text Who is this?, as shown in Figure 2-26. Click the text and 
then type the name of the individual in the text box. Each time you open the 

132
Organizing and Managing in the Organizer
photo and move the mouse cursor over the individual faces, the pop-up text 
box displays the names of the individuals you recorded when you typed the 
names.
Figure 2-26: The People Recognition dialog box opens after searching 
for people in the Organizer.
Organizing and Managing in the Organizer
Elements provides you with a great opportunity for organizing files in the 
form of keyword tags. After you acquire your images in the Organizer and 
sort them, you can add some permanent keyword tags according to the 
dates you took the pictures, the subject matter, or some other categorical 
arrangement.
	
Keyword tags were referred to as collections in Elements 5 and earlier.
In the Organizer window, two panels help you sort your pictures and keep 
them well organized. You use the Keyword Tags panel (which we talk about 
in the section “Working with keyword tags,” later in this chapter) to identify 
individual images by using a limitless number of options for categorizing 
your pictures. On the Keyword Tags panel, you can create keyword tags and 
collection groups to neatly organize files.

133
Book II 
Chapter 2
Working in the

Organizing and Managing in the Organizer
	
Keyword tags are handy when you want to use the many different project 
options, which we explain in Book IX, Chapter 1. You create a keyword tag 
from files stored in various folders on your hard drive and preview the 
images to be used in a creation. You can, for example, select images to use 
when you’re creating slide shows and photo albums. When you finish your 
creations, go back and delete the keyword tag.
In the following sections, you can find out how to create and manage key­
word tags.
Creating a new keyword tag
To create a new keyword tag and add photos to the tag, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open photos in the Organizer.
	
	 Open the Organizer window by clicking the Organizer button in an edit­
ing mode or by selecting Organize on the Welcome screen. Choose File➪
Get Photos and Videos➪From Files and Folders. (Note that you should’ve 
already copied some photos to your hard drive, as we explain in Book II, 
Chapter 1.)
	
2.	 To create a new keyword tag, click the plus sign (+) icon in the 
Keyword Tags panel to open a drop-down list and then choose New 
Keyword Tag.
	
	 The Create Keyword Tag dialog 
box opens, as shown in Figure 2-27.
	
3.	 Type a name for the tag in the 
Name text box and add a note to 
describe the keyword tag.
	
	 You might use the location where 
you took the photos, 
the subject matter, or other 
descriptive information for 
the note.
	
4.	 If you want to assign the keyword 
tag to a map location on Yahoo! 
Maps, click the Place on Map 
button.
	
	 When you click Place on Map, a 
dialog box opens in which you type 
a city name for placing the image 
on Yahoo! Maps. Type a city name 
and select the correct city from 
options provided in a second dia­
log box.
Figure 2-27: The Create Keyword Tag dialog 
box.

134
Organizing and Managing in the Organizer
	
5.	 Click OK in the Create Keyword Tag dialog box.
	
	 You return to the Organizer window.
	
6.	 In the Organizer window, select the photos you want to give 
keyword tags.
	
	 Click a photo and Shift-click another photo to select photos in a group. 
Click a photo and Ctrl-click different photos scattered around the 
Organizer window to select photos in a nonconsecutive order.
	
7.	 To add a new keyword tag to a photo (or selection of photos), click 
one of the selected photos in the Organizer window and drag the 
photo thumbnail to the New Tag icon in the Keyword Tags panel.
	
	 Alternatively, you can drag a tag from the Keyword Tags panel to the 
selected photos.
	
	 When you release the mouse button, the new keyword tags are added to 
the selected photos.
	
8.	 Repeat Steps 3 through 7 to create keyword tags for all the images you 
want to organize.
	
9.	 To view one or more keyword 
tags, click the empty square adja­
cent to a keyword-tag icon to 
show the photos marked with 
that particular keyword-tag icon.
	
	 When you click the empty square, 
an icon in the shape of a pair of 
binoculars appears inside the 
square, as shown in Figure 2-28. All 
photos matching the keyword tags 
are shown in the Organizer 
window.
	
To return to viewing all photos in the 
Organizer, click the binoculars in the 
Keyword Tags panel. The square 
returns to empty and turns off viewing the tagged files.
Working with keyword tags
You can manage keyword tags pretty easily by using the Keyword Tags 
panel. To access the major menu commands, either click the plus sign (+) 
icon in the Keyword Tags panel to call up the New drop-down list or right-
click a keyword tag on the Keyword Tags panel and make your choice from 
the context menu that appears.
The New drop-down list offers you the following commands:

✓	New Keyword Tag: Create a new keyword tag, as we describe in the 
steps in the preceding section.
	
✓	New Sub-Category: A subcategory is like a nested bookmark. Create a 
sub-category by selecting New Sub-Category from the New menu; a dia­
log box opens, prompting you to type a name for the new subcategory. 
As an example of how you might use keyword tags and subcategories, 
you might have a keyword tag named Uncle Joe’s Wedding. Then, you 
might create subcategories for Bride’s Dressing Room, Ceremony, 
Family Photos, Reception, and so on.
	
✓	New Category: Choose New Category from the New menu in the 
Keyword Tags panel to open a dialog box that prompts you to type a 
name for the new category. By default, you find predefined category 
names for People, Places, Events, and Other. If you want to add your 
own custom category, use this menu command.
	
✓	From File: If you export a keyword tag, the file is written as XML (eXten­
sible Markup Language). When you choose From File, you can import an 
XML file containing keyword tags as were added using the Keyword Tags 
to a File command.
	
✓	Save Keyword Tags to a File: You can save keyword tags to a file that 
can be retrieved with the From File command. This option is handy 
when you open a different catalog file and want to import the same col­
lection names created in one catalog file to another catalog file. (See the 
section “Cataloging Files” earlier in this chapter.)
	
✓	Collapse All Keyword Tags: Keyword tags appear like bookmark lists 
that can be collapsed and expanded. An expanded list shows you all the 
subcategory keyword tags. Choose Collapse All Keyword Tags to col­
lapse the list.
	
✓	Expand All Keyword Tags: This command expands a collapsed list.
	
When you create a new keyword tag, you see a large icon in the Keyword 
Tags panel. The default tags appear with small icons. You can access the 
items that appear below default tags by clicking the right-pointing arrow to 
expand the list.
Right-click a Keyword Tag name to make the following menu commands 
appear:
	
✓	Change <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag to a Sub-Category: Choose 
this menu command to change a specific keyword tag into a subcategory 
of keyword tags.
	
✓	Edit <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag: This menu command opens 
the Edit Keyword Tag dialog box. You can rename a keyword tag, change 
the note, or change the map location in this dialog box. Alternatively, 
you can click the Pencil tool on the Keyword Tags panel to open the 
same dialog box.

136
Organizing and Managing in the Organizer
	
✓	Delete <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag: Select a keyword tag and 
then select this menu option to delete it. An alternative way to delete a 
keyword tag is to select the tag and then click the Trash icon in the 
panel.
	
	Deleting a keyword tag doesn’t delete files.
	
✓	Place on Map: Choose Place on Map to add images to a Yahoo! Map 
location.
	
✓	Remove from Map: Choose this command to remove tags from Yahoo! 
Maps.
	
✓	Show on Map: This command opens the Yahoo! Maps panel and shows 
the red pin at the map location with which the image(s) are associated.
	
✓	New Search Using <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag: This command 
searches through a catalog and displays all the photos assigned a partic­
ular keyword tag in the Organizer window.
	
✓	Add Photos with <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag to Search Results: 
If you select one photo in the Organizer, the number is one. Selecting 
more than one photo changes the number to the total number of 
selected images. When you open a context menu, the selected images 
are added to the keyword tag at the place where the context menu 
opened.
	
✓	Exclude Photos with <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag from Search 
Results: Select photos in the Organizer window and choose this com­
mand to exclude the selected photos from the search.
	
✓	Attach <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag to <n> Selected Items: 
Select a file in the Organizer window and choose this command to attach 
the keyword tag to the file.
	
Keyword tags are saved automatically with the catalog you’re working in. 
By default, Elements creates a catalog and auto-saves your work to it. If 
you happen to create another catalog (as we explain earlier in the chap­
ter), your keyword tags disappear. Be aware of which catalog is open when 
you create keyword tags so you can later return to them.
Getting your head in the clouds
	
Elements 8 introduces another way to view and search for photos in a cata­
log: the Tags Cloud feature. Click the View Tags Cloud icon in the Keyword 
Tags panel, as shown in Figure 2-29. When you click the icon, an alphabetical 
list of your tags appears in the panel.

Figure 2-29: Click the Tags Cloud icon to display a hierarchical list of 
the tags categories.
Click a tag name in the list to select a tag and view all photos tagged with the 
respective name.
	
To return to the default tags view, click the View Tag Hierarchy icon to the 
left of the View Tags Cloud icon in the Keyword Tags panel.
Using the Timeline
When you choose Window➪Timeline or press Crtl+L, a timeline appears in 
the Organizer window. The Timeline begins with those images you added to 
a catalog at the earliest date and stretches across the Organizer window to 
the photos taken most recently.
You can narrow a search to examine photos within a given time frame by 
dragging the Timeline slider left or right (see Figure 2-30). You can also move 
two other sliders on the Timeline. By dragging the left-facing arrowheads to 
the right and the right-facing arrowheads to the left, you can narrow the 
number of thumbnail images that appear in the Organizer window.
Figure 2-30: Drag the slider to narrow the timeframe.

138
Creating Albums
	
When you move the two outside sliders toward each other, you hide image 
thumbnails appearing in the Organizer that are outside the dates on the 
Timeline relative to the slider positions. When you move the center slider, 
Elements displays the first photo on a given date with the date flashing 
below the respective image thumbnail.
Using the Properties panel
We introduced the Properties panel earlier in Figure 2-21 when we talked 
about adding captions and notes. In addition to adding this information to 
images, the Properties panel offers you some information about your files. 
The information includes
	
✓	Rating files: You can assign ratings to files, as we describe later in this 
chapter in the section “Rating images.”
	
✓	Date: The panel reports the date the picture was shot (or scanned).
	
✓	Directory path: The panel displays the directory path for the file loca­
tion on your hard drive.
	
✓	Sound: If the file contains a sound, the sound information is displayed.
Creating Albums
With keyword tags, you can organize files into categories and subcategories. 
Doing so keeps your files neatly organized within a catalog. Elements offers 
additional organizing control in the Albums panel. You might want to orga­
nize an album for sharing photos with others on Photoshop.com, assemble 
an album that rates each photo from one to five stars, create a slide show, or 
just use the Albums panel to further segregate images within different 
categories.
	
Be aware that you have an Album panel in the Panel Bin, and you have some 
options in the Create panel for designing projects similar to (but not the 
same as) photo albums. To avoid confusion, Elements refers to the projects 
not as photo albums but as Photo Books and Photo Collages. The term 
Album in Photoshop Elements nomenclature refers to a collection of images 
that are not yet integrated into projects. You can use the Album panel to 
organize and help manage your photo files.
	
Think of a catalog as a parent item and keyword tags as its children. 
Within keyword tags, you can use the sort options we’ve talked about in this 
chapter to sort files according to date. If you still have a number of files in an 
Organizer window that are hard to manage, you can create tags that form 

139
Book II 
Chapter 2
Working in the 
Organizer
Creating Albums
subcategories within the keyword tags. Additionally, you can create an 
album out of a number of photos within a given keyword tag. For example, 
you might have a huge number of photos taken on a European vacation. 
Your catalog contains all the images taken on that trip. You can then create 
keyword tags for files according to the country visited. You then might rate 
the photos according to the best pictures you took on your trip. The highest-
rated images could then be assembled in an album and then later viewed as 
a slide show or integrated as part of a project such as a Photo Book.
Rating images
You can rate photos in the Organizer by tagging images with one to five 
stars. You might have some exceptional photos that you want to give a 
five-star rating. Poor photos with lighting and focus problems might be 
rated with one star.
To rate a file with a star rating, open a 
context menu by right-clicking a photo 
and select Properties from that menu. 
The Properties – General panel, shown 
in Figure 2-31, opens. Click a star to 
rate the photo. Alternatively, you can 
click a photo, choose Edit➪Ratings, 
and choose a star rating from the sub­
menu that appears.
To return to a view in which all your 
photos are shown in the Organizer, 
including all photos you haven’t rated, 
click Show All in the Shortcuts bar.
Adding rated files 
to an album
You might want to rate images with star ratings and then add all your images 
to an album. Within the album, you can still choose to view your pictures 
according to star ratings.
Creating an album
In the section “Working with keyword tags,” earlier in this chapter, we 
discuss how creating keyword tags and assigning tags to photos help you 
organize a collection of photos — and how subcategories help you divide a 
Figure 2-31: The Properties dialog box with 
a photo rated with five stars.

collection into more specific groups. With albums and star ratings, you can 
identify groups within a collection that you might want to print, share, or 
use in onscreen slide shows.

6.	 Click Done at the bottom of the 
panel — unfortunately not visible 
in Figure 2-34.
	
	 Your new album now appears 
listed in the Albums panel.
That’s it! Your new album is created, 
and any photos you drag to the album 
in the future are added to it. You can 
isolate all the photos within a given 
album by clicking the album name in 
the Albums panel.
	
Creating multiple albums uses only a 
fraction of the memory required to 
duplicate photos for multiple purposes 
(such as printing, Web hosting, shar­
ing, and so on).
Creating a Smart Album
You can perform a search based on a 
number of different criteria. You can, 
for example, rate images with stars and 
choose to view all files with three or 
more stars, or maybe you changed 
camera models and want to show only 
the photos taken with your newest 
camera. You can search a catalog by 
metadata, location, or some other cri­
terion. Furthermore, you can combine 
searches, first searching for (say) a 
location and then searching the files 
within a given date range.
Another option for searching files is 
performing a search and saving not 
only the search results but also a complex set of search criteria in the form 
of a Smart Album. You create a Smart Album by opening the New menu in 
the Albums panel and choosing New Smart Album.
Figure 2-34: Drag photos to the Items area 
in the Album Details panel.

Creating Albums
The New Smart Album dialog box 
opens, as shown in Figure 2-35. Type 
a name for your new Smart Album 
and make selections for the search 
criteria below the Name text box. 
Click OK, and the Smart Album is 
listed above the albums in the 
Albums panel.
Creating an Album Group
The Albums panel contains all the 
albums and Smart Albums you cre­
ate in an organized list. By default, 
the albums are listed in alphabetical 
order. If you add many albums to the panel, the list can be long, making it 
difficult to find the album you want to use for a given editing session.
An Album Group is no more than a divider shown in the Albums panel. You 
don’t add photos to the group. You nest albums within a group in a hierar­
chical order. To see how to create an Album Group, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Create several albums.
	
	 To begin, you should have two or more albums added to the Albums 
panel. For example, suppose that you have many photos of a vacation 
trip to Hawaii. You want to divide the photos by images taken at a luau, 
a diving trip, a day on Waikiki Beach, or photos of other similar events 
that you want to group together. For each category — such as Luau, 
Diving, or Waikiki — you create a separate album.
	
2.	 Create an Album Group by clicking the New menu (the + sign) in the 
Albums panel and choosing New Album Group.
	
	 The Create Album Category 
dialog box (as shown in Figure 
2-36) opens.
	
3.	 Type a name for the group in the 
Album Category Name text box.
	
	 You also have an option to choose 
a parent group from a drop-down 
list so you can nest albums in a 
hierarchical order.
	
4.	 Click OK.
	
	 Your new Album Group is added to 
the Albums panel.

Album, add the search criteria, and click OK 
to add the album to the Albums panel.

5.	 Click and drag an album onto the 
Album Group name in the Albums 
panel.
	
	 The albums you drag to the Album 
Group are nested within the group, 
as shown in Figure 2-37.
Figure 2-37 shows an expanded Album 
Group, as denoted by the list (below 
Wedding Photos) and the disclosure 
triangle. To collapse a group, click 
the down-pointing arrow. The group 
names remain visible and provide 
you with more viewing space in the 
Albums panel, making it easier to 
scroll long lists.
Like keyword tags, albums can be saved to an XML file, and the files can be 
loaded in the Albums panel. Open the New menu, where you find commands 
for Save Albums to File and From File. You can export an album to a file and 
then copy the file to another computer, making it easy to organize photos on 
several computers.
Hiding Files That Get in the Way
Elements offers a few ways to hide files so you can keep your images orga­
nized and easy to find.
With a simple menu command, you can mark selected files in the Organizer 
as hidden. You might have several files of the same subject and want to keep 
only one file visible in the Organizer window. However, you may not want to 
delete the other photos. You can hide files in the Organizer window — and 
show the hidden files later on by using menu commands.
Select files you want to hide, and from either the Edit menu or a context 
menu, choose Visibility➪Mark as Hidden. To see the files you marked as hid­
den, return to the same Visibility menu and choose Show Hidden. When you 
remove the check mark for Show Hidden, you hide the files. To toggle easily 
between showing and hiding files marked for hiding, choose View➪Hidden 
Files. Selecting this menu command toggles between showing and hiding the 
files you marked for hiding.
Figure 2-37: Albums are nested below an 
Album Group.

Hiding Files That Get in the Way
Stacking ’em up
Think of stacks like a stack of cards that are face-up. You see only the front 
card, and all the other cards are hidden behind that card. Stacks work the 
same way. You hide different images behind a foreground image. At any 
time, you can sort the images or display all images in the stack in the 
Organizer window.
To create a stack, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Organizer, select several photos.
	
	 You can select any number of photos. However, you can’t stack audio or 
movie files.
	
2.	 Choose Edit➪Stack➪Stack Selected Photos.
	
	 Elements stacks your photos. The first image you select remains in view 
in the Organizer window. In the upper-right area, an icon that looks like 
a stack of cards appears on the image thumbnail when you’ve stacked 
some images. When you double-click the photo to open the stack in the 
Organizer, you find the same icon in the top-right corner, as shown in 
Figure 2-38.

Hiding Files That Get in the Way
After you stack a group of images, you can use the Stack submenu com­
mands to manage the photos. Click a stack to select it and then choose 
Edit➪Stack. The submenu commands that are available include
	
✓	Automatically Suggest Photo Stacks: Select this command to make 
Elements search the photos in the Organizer window for visually similar 
appearances. Photos that look similar are opened in a separate window, 
where you can select the photos you want to stack. Make a selection of 
two or more photos, and select Stack Selected Photos.
	
✓	Stack Selected Photos: This command remains grayed out unless you 
have several photos selected to create a stack.
	
✓	Unstack Photos: Click a stack in the Organizer and choose this com­
mand to return all images to the Organizer window and eliminate the 
stack.
	
✓	Expand Photos in Stack: This command expands the stack to show all 
thumbnail images in the Organizer window.
	
✓	Collapse Photos in Stack: This command collapses a stack to show only 
the top photo in the Organizer window.
	
✓	Flatten Stack: After you stack some photos, this command becomes 
available. When you flatten a stack, the top-level photo is retained and 
all other photos in the stack are deleted from the catalog.
	
	Be careful with this command. All photos except for the top photo really 
are deleted from the catalog — although not from your hard disk.
	
✓	Remove Photo from Stack: Choosing this command removes the 
selected photo from the stack. It does not delete the photo from your 
catalog but merely moves it outside the stack.
	
✓	Set as Top Photo: Before accessing this command, you first choose 
Expand Photos in Stack. If you don’t like the topmost photo, select 
another and choose this menu command to move the selected photo to 
the top of the stack.
	
If you want to view all stacks in an Organizer window in expanded form, 
choose View➪Expand All Stacks. Using this command, you don’t have to 
select stacks individually in the Organizer before expanding them.
Creating versions
Versions are similar to stacks, but you create versions from only one file. You 
can edit an image and save both the edited version and the original as a ver­
sion set. You can make additional edits in either of these editing modes and 
save them to a version set. To create a version set, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select an image by clicking it in the Organizer window.

146
Hiding Files That Get in the Way
	
2.	 Apply an edit.
	
	 For example, right in the Organizer, you can correct some brightness 
problems in your image. Choose Edit➪Auto Smart Fix to adjust contrast 
and brightness. See Book VIII, Chapter 2 for more details on adjusting 
contrast and brightness.
	
3.	 View the items in the version set by clicking the image in the Organizer 
and choosing Edit➪Version Set➪Expand Items in Version Set.
	
	 Elements automatically creates a version set for you when you apply the 
Auto Smart Fix to the file. A new Organizer window opens and shows 
two thumbnail images — one representing the original image and the 
other representing the edited version.
	
4.	 To open the original in Edit Full mode, select the original image and 
then select Full Edit from the Display drop-down list on the Organizer 
Menu bar.
	
5.	 Edit the image in Edit Full mode.
	
	 You can choose from many different menu commands to edit the image. 
For example, change the color mode to Indexed Color by choosing 
Image➪Mode➪Indexed Color, as we explain in Book III, Chapter 2.
	
6.	 Save a version by choosing File➪Save As.
	
7.	 In the Save Options area of the Save As dialog box, select the Include 
in the Organizer and Save in Version Set with Original check boxes.
	
8.	 Click Save.
	
	 The edit made in Edit Full mode is saved as another version in your 
version set.
	
When you have a version set, you can open the Edit➪Version Set submenu 
and choose menu commands that are similar to the commands available 
with stacks. (See the preceding section for details.)
After you create a version set, you find additional submenu commands you 
can use to manage the version set. Choose Edit➪Version Set, or open a con­
text menu on a version set and then choose Version Set. The submenu, as 
shown in Figure 2-39, opens.

Items listed in the Version Set submenu include
	
✓	Expand Items in Version Set: Click a version set and choose this menu 
command to expand the items in the version set.
	
✓	Collapse Items in Version Set: When items are expanded, you can 
return them to a collapsed view by selecting this command.
	
✓	Flatten Version Set: Be careful here. If you choose this command, you 
lose all items in the version set except the top image.
	
✓	Convert Version Set to Individual Items: This command removes items 
from the version set and adds each version as a separate image to the 
Organizer window.
	
✓	Revert to Original: This command deletes the version set and returns 
you to the original, unedited version of the file.
	
✓	Remove Item(s) from Version Set: This option removes any selected 
item (or items) from a version set.
	
✓	Set as Top Item: When viewing an expanded version set, click one of the 
images and choose this item to move it to the top.
Protecting Your Assets
Computer users often learn the hard way about the importance of backing 
up a hard drive — and the precious data that took a lot of time to create and 
edit. We can save you some aggravation right now before you spend any 
more time editing your photos in Elements.
We authors are so paranoid when we’re writing a book that we back up our 
chapters on multiple drives, CDs, and DVDs when we finish them. The stan­
dard rule is that if you spend sufficient time working on a project and it gets 
to the point at which redoing your work would be a major aggravation, it’s 
time to back up your files.
Backing up your catalog
When organizing your files, adding keyword tags and albums, and creating 
stacks and version sets, you want to back up the catalog file in case your cat­
alog becomes corrupted.
Here’s how you can use Elements to create a backup of your data:
	
1.	 Choose File➪Backup Catalog to CD/DVD or Hard Drive to open the 
Backup Catalog to CD/DVD or Hard Drive Wizard.
	
	 This wizard has three panes that Elements walks you through; it’s a 
pretty painless way to back up your files.

148
Protecting Your Assets
	
2.	 Select the source you want to back up.
	
	 The first pane in the Burn/Backup Wizard offers two options:
	
•	 Full Backup: Click this radio button to perform your first backup or 
when you’re writing files to a new media source.
	
•	 Incremental Backup: Use this option if you’ve already performed at 
least one backup and you want to update the backed-up files.
	
3.	 Click Next and select a target location for your backed-up files.
	
	 Active drives, including CD/DVD drives attached to your computer, 
appear in the Select Destination Drive list, as shown in Figure 2-40. Select 
a drive, and Elements automatically assesses the write speed and identi­
fies a previous backup file if one was created. The wizard also displays 
the total size of the files you have chosen to copy. This information is 
helpful so you know whether you need more than one CD or DVD to 
complete the backup.
Figure 2-40: You can choose your destination backup media 
in the wizard.
	
4.	 If you intend to copy files to your hard drive or to another hard drive 
attached to your computer, click the Browse button and identify the 
path.
	
	 If you use a media source, such as a CD or DVD, Elements prompts you 
to insert a disc and readies the media for writing.
	
5.	 Click Done, and the backup commences.
	
	 Be certain to not interrupt the backup. It might take some time, so just 
let Elements work away until you’re notified that the backup is 
complete.

Backing up photos and files
With files stored all over your hard drive, manually copying files to a second 
hard drive, CD-ROM, or DVD would take quite a bit of time. Fortunately, 
Elements makes finding files to back up a breeze.
Choose File➪Make a CD/DVD, and then in the dialog box that opens, click 
Yes to confirm the action. The Make a CD/DVD dialog box then opens. Select 
a hard drive or a CD/DVD drive, type a name for the backup folder, and click 
OK. Elements goes about copying all files shown in the Organizer window to 
your backup source.

✓	Sorting images
✓	Managing photos
✓	Working with stacks
✓	Creating slide shows
✓	Outputting files
T
he Mac version of Elements doesn’t include Organizer. On the Mac, you 
use Adobe Bridge to sort, organize, and manage your photos. Adobe 
Bridge doesn’t have all the options you find with Organizer, but Bridge does 
offer some things you won’t find in the Windows version of Organizer.
This chapter is all about the Mac and using Adobe Bridge. We offer some 
handy things you can do with Adobe Bridge and explain how Bridge 
handles some similar tasks as Organizer on Windows. An 
entire book could be written on Adobe Bridge; we can’t 
hope to cover everything you have available in the pro­
gram, but we can offer pointers for getting around the 
Bridge window — and demonstrate some standard 
features of the Elements Organizer running under 
Windows.
If you’re a Windows user, feel free to skip this chap­
ter. If you use Photoshop Elements on a Mac, read 
on and discover some great options you have with 
Adobe Bridge.
Looking at the Adobe Bridge Workspace
When you install Elements on the Mac, Adobe Bridge is installed 
automatically as a separate executable program. You can launch Bridge 
from within Edit Full mode while Elements is open, or you can launch Adobe 
Bridge by double-clicking the program icon or program alias that is auto­
matically added to your desktop after installation.

152
Looking at the Adobe Bridge Workspace
When you launch Adobe Bridge, you see the Bridge workspace, as shown in 
Figure 3-1. A quick look at the Bridge window includes the following items:
	
✓	Go Forward/Go Back: Click the arrows to navigate the window where 
you find the image thumbnails.
	
✓	Go to Parent or Favorites: The menu lists recently viewed folders and 
items you’ve identified as Favorites.
	
✓	Reveal Recent File or Go to Recent Folder: Recently viewed images are 
listed in the menu as you view them in Bridge. In addition, you find a 
number of menu commands that link to other Adobe applications if 
installed on your computer.
	
✓	Get Photos: Click this icon to open Adobe Downloader to copy photos 
from your camera or card reader to your computer.
	
✓	Refine: Click this icon, and a menu offers several choices. You can view 
photos in Review mode (appearing like a slide show), batch-rename 
files, and obtain file information on a selected file in the Bridge window.
	
✓	Open in Camera Raw: You can open any file in Camera Raw as we 
explain in Book III, Chapter 3. Click this icon, and when you open a file, it 
opens in the raw converter.
	
✓	Output: Select photos in the Bridge window and click this icon to output 
your files as PDF or for a Web browser.
	
✓	Content pane: This area displays image thumbnails of photos within the 
selected folder.
	
✓	Adobe Media Gallery 2 (F1): Click this item, and the Bridge window 
changes to display panes titled Output, Document, and Layout. The new 
view offers some choices such as outputting as PDF or Web Gallery, doc­
ument dimensions, layout options, overlay settings, playback options for 
video and slide shows, and adding watermarks to photos.
	
✓	Essentials: From the drop-down list, you can choose options to change 
the workspace view. You can view photos as a slide show, examine 
images in a light table, and choose from several other options. If you cre­
ate a custom workspace view, you can save it, after which the new saved 
workspace appears in the menu.
	
✓	Search: Type search criteria in the Search text box. From the drop-down 
list, you can choose to search within Bridge or use Apple’s Spotlight.
	
✓	Switch to Compact Mode: Compact mode is a much more simplified 
view of the Bridge window where folders on your hard disk appear in a 
left panel, images appear in the center panel, and a few tabs appear on 
the right. If the other views appear complicated, switch to Compact 
Mode for a simplified view of your photos.

✓	Folders: The Folders tab is like a Finder List View where you can navi­
gate your hard disk and view contents of folders. Unlike the Windows 
version of Elements, you don’t use a catalog to view photos. Any images 
you copy to your hard disk, you can view in the Bridge window.

selected in the Content tab.
	
✓	New Collection/New Smart Collection: Click these items to create a 
New Collection or a New Smart Collection. A New Collection is created 
by selecting photos and clicking the icon where the selected photos are 
included in the New Collection. A Smart Collection opens a dialog box 
where you can search photos based on several criteria. When the pho­
tos are found, they’re added to a New Smart Collection.

tos as thumbnail images, as shown in Figure 3-1. 
	
✓	View Content as Details: Click this icon to change from the thumbnail 
view of images in the Content tab to a list of photo thumbnails with cer­
tain specifics about the images, such as date created, date modified, file 
size, file format, and so on. The text displaying the metadata appears to 
the right of each photo in the list.
	
✓	View Content as List: The view in the Content panel displays a list of 
mini-thumbnail views with creation date, file size, file type, dimensions, 
resolution, and color profile. The photos can be sorted in the list by 
clicking the heading name. For example, click Dimensions to sort photos 
according to physical size in ascending order.

✓	Preview: The Preview tab displays a larger preview of a selected photo 
in the Bridge window. You can zoom previews by clicking the cursor in 
the Preview tab.
	
✓	Metadata: File information such as the filename, file format, file dimen­
sions, color mode, bit depth, f-stop, lens focal length, camera properties, 
location, and much more is considered metadata and recorded with 
your photos. In some cases, the metadata is customizable and added by 
the end user. All the metadata for a given photo can be viewed in the 
Metadata tab.
	
✓	Keywords: You can identify photos using keyword tags, as we explain in 
Book II, Chapter 2, on using the Organizer in Windows. Adobe Bridge on 
the Mac offers a similar feature for identifying and sorting images.
	
✓	Camera data: At the top of the Metadata tab, you find a quick at-a-
glance view of the information related to taking a photo with your digital 
camera.
	
✓	File Properties: The File Properties pane displays information about the 
file; it’s similar to the file properties you have with the Organizer.
	
✓	Cancel: Many items in the Metadata tab can be edited by clicking an 
item in a list and then typing information. If you type something and 
want to cancel your edits, click this icon.
	
✓	Apply: Click Apply when you’re editing metadata and want to save your 
edits as part of the metadata.
Adding photos to the Bridge window
As we stated earlier in this chapter, Bridge doesn’t support a catalog like the 
one you have with the Elements Organizer on Windows. You use Bridge on 
the Mac like a navigation tool when viewing thumbnail images of photos.
There are basically two ways you go about adding photos:
	
✓	Adobe Bridge CS4 – Photo Downloader: Click the Get Photos icon in 
the Bridge window (refer to Figure 3-1), and the Photo Downloader 
opens. From here, you can copy photos from a camera or card reader to 
your hard disk and open the folder in the Bridge window.
	
✓	Copy photos in the Desktop view to your hard disk: Mac users frequently 
copy files from card readers, CD-ROMs, and external media to a computer 
hard disk. This method is consistent with the way you typically work on 
the Mac. Drag a folder of photos from a card reader or camera to a loca­
tion on your hard disk. In Adobe Bridge, open the folder, and thumbnail 
images immediately appear in the Bridge window.

156
Looking at the Adobe Bridge Workspace
After you’ve copied the photos to your 
computer, click the Folders tab in the 
Bridge window. The scroll bar on the 
right side of the Folders tab enables 
you to move up and down the list.
Adjacent to the folder names, you’ll 
find a right-pointing arrow. Click the 
arrow to expand the folder. If you have 
several nested folders, each folder can 
be expanded by clicking the right-
pointing arrows (as shown in Figure 
3-2). To view photos in a given folder, 
click the folder name.
Adobe Bridge is not limited to display­
ing image previews. You can observe a 
complete set of contents in a folder. 
Some file types such as Microsoft 
Office files won’t show you a preview, 
but other file types, such as PDF, are 
shown with previews.
Bridge is a great file organizer and loca­
tor for all your files. You can use the 
program whether you work with 
Elements or with other computer programs.
Setting Bridge preferences
Like those preferences we discuss in Book I, Chapter 4 for Edit Full mode 
and the Windows Organizer, Adobe Bridge has its own set of preferences. 
You locate the preference options by choosing Adobe Bridge CS4➪
Preferences.
The first preference options appear as General, as shown in Figure 3-3. These 
preferences relate to options you can adjust for working with Elements and 
Adobe Bridge.
One of the important choices you have in the General Preferences is the 
Behavior item for launching the Photo Downloader. If you don’t want the 
Figure 3-2: Click the right-pointing arrows 
to expand folders.

minutes to explore the 
settings. Most of what you 
find in the various prefer­
ence choices is intuitive 
and self-instructive. When 
you make a change to a preference item, click OK and the new preference 
choice is active.
Sorting Your Photos
Bridge makes it easy to sort photos according to a variety of different sort 
options and it’s all easily handled with a menu. Click Adobe Media Gallery, 
and the window changes to offer more options. Look to the top of the Bridge 
window, and you find a Sort by Filename (the default) option with a down-
pointing arrow. Click the arrow, and the Sort menu opens, as shown in 
Figure 3-4.
The options you have for sorting photos include
	
✓	By Filename: Choose this option to display photos in the Bridge window 
alphabetically by the name of the file. To change ascending to descending 
order, click the up-pointing arrowhead, shown in Figure 3-4.
	
✓	By Type: Choose this option to sort photos according to file type (JPEG, 
TIFF, PDF, PSD, and so on).
	
✓	By Date Created: Displays the list in ascending order, according to the 
date the images were shot.
Figure 3-3: Adobe Bridge Preferences.

158
Sorting Your Photos
	
✓	By Date Modified: Sorts the 
images according to the dates you 
last edited the photos.
	
✓	By Size: Sorts the photos by file 
size, with the smallest file sizes 
appearing first.
	
✓	By Dimensions: Sorts photos 
according to the physical size of 
the images.
	
✓	By Resolution: Sorts photos 
according to resolution.
	
✓	By Color Profile: Sorts photos 
according to color profiles. (See 
Book IX, Chapter 2 for more on 
color profiles.)
	
✓	By Label: You can add labels as we 
explain later in this chapter in the 
section “Labeling photos.” After you’ve labeled photos, you can sort 
according to the label names.
	
✓	By Rating: You can rate photos with stars just like they can be rated in 
the Organizer, as we explain later in the section “Rating photos.” After 
you apply star ratings to photos, you can sort according to the ratings.
	
✓	Manually: Photos can be moved around in the Bridge window and 
sorted manually.
To manually sort photos, do the following:
	
1.	 Open Adobe Bridge.
	
2.	 Click a photo thumbnail in the Bridge window and drag it to a new 
location.
	
	 The Bridge window is like a slide sorter. You can click and drag photos 
to different locations, as shown in Figure 3-5.
	
3.	 Open the Sort menu.
	
	 Notice that the menu choice switches automatically to Manually.

Organizing Your Pictures
In addition to the sorting options you have in Bridge, you have some manual 
options: You can add labels, rate images according to stars, and add key­
words. Having more sorting choices helps you create a well-organized 
workflow.
Labeling photos
A menu command handles adding labels to photos. Labels provide you a 
means for sorting photos and a reminder to review, edit, or approve photos.
The process for labeling a photo is quite simple: You select one or more 
photos in Adobe Bridge, open the Label menu, and choose a label option. In 
the Label menu, you find commands for both ratings and labels. We talk 
about ratings in the next section, “Rating photos.” For now, look over the 
options you have in the Label menu:
	
✓	No Label: By default, all photos are not labeled. If you label a photo and 
want to remove the label, choose this command.
	
✓	Select (Ô+6): This option is like a first-level label.
	
✓	Second (Ô+7): As the name implies, this is a second-level label.

160
Organizing Your Pictures
	
✓	Approved (Ô+8): Use this command to label photos you’ve edited that 
are approved for output or distribution.
	
✓	Review (Ô+9): Use this command to mark photos you want to review.
	
✓	To Do: Use this command for photos you want to mark for editing.
As you label photos, you’ll find a color bar appearing below the labeled pho­
tos, as shown in Figure 3-6. If you want to sort photos according to labels, 
open the Sort menu and choose By Label.
Figure 3-6: Photos labeled and ready for sorting by label.
	
For a quick at-a-glance view of available ratings for labels and stars, click the 
Filter tab in the lower-left corner of the Bridge window. You can apply labels 
and stars by clicking the respective items in this panel.
Rating photos
Rating photos is handled similar to labeling photos. To add star ratings to 
photos, do the following:
	
1.	 Open Adobe Bridge.
	
2.	 Select one or more photos to which you want to give the same rating 
value.

3.	 Open the Label menu and choose a star rating.
	
	 For a quick-and-easy method use your keyboard. Use Ô+1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 to 
add ratings 1 through 5 respectively.
	
4.	 After rating several photos, open the Sort menu and choose By Rating.
	
	 The photos are sorted in ascending order, as shown in Figure 3-7.
Figure 3-7: Photos rated with stars and sorted according to rating.
	
You can increase a rating by choosing Label➪Increase Rating or use Ô+, 
(comma). To decrease a rating, choose Label➪+. (period). Ratings are reor­
dered for both labels and stars when you increase/decrease the ratings.
Creating collections
Collections offer yet another means for managing photos. You have two 
methods for creating collections. You can select photos and create a new 
collection; the photos are then added to your collection. A second method is 
to create a Smart Collection where you can use a variety of sorting options 
to find photos and add to a new collection.
You can use collections to divide an event you’ve photographed into several 
categories. For example, if you have wedding photos, you might create sepa­
rate collections for the preceremony photos, the wedding ceremony, and 

162
Organizing Your Pictures
the wedding reception. All the wedding photos might be placed in a single 
folder on your hard drive, but you can divide the photos using the Bridge 
Collections options for a more-organized arrangement.
Creating a new collection
Creating a new collection is very easy in Adobe Bridge. You simply select the 
photos you want to add to a new collection and click the New Collection 
icon in the Collections tab. Here’s how you do it:
	
1.	 Open Adobe Bridge; in the Bridge window, select the photos you want 
to add to a new collection.
	
2.	 Click the Collections tab in the lower-left corner of the Bridge window.
	
	 The Collections pane opens.
	
3.	 Click the New Collection icon.
	
	 The icon appears with a plus (+) symbol at the bottom of the Collections 
tab, as shown in Figure 3-8.
	
	 A dialog box opens and asks whether you want to add the selected pho­
tos to a new collection. 
	
4.	 Click Yes in the dialog box.
	
	 A new collection icon appears in the list for collections in the 
Collections pane. 
	
5.	 Type a name for your new collection.
	
	 The photos are now part of a new collection, as shown in Figure 3-8.
	
6.	 Click the Go Back button (the left arrow at the top of the Bridge win­
dow; refer to Figure 3-1).
	
	 You return to the view that displays all the photos in the selected folder.
When you’ve created a collection, you can add or remove photos as follows:
	
✓	To add more photos to a collection, select the photo thumbnails in the 
Bridge window and drag them to the new collection name in the 
Collections pane.
	
✓	To remove a photo from a collection, select the photo in the collection 
and click Remove from Collection in the top-right corner of the Content 
pane.

Creating a Smart Collection
You can create a Smart Collection by selecting a variety of filter options to 
locate and add the photos you want to include in a new collection. No need 
to select any images in the Bridge window. Just open the Collections tab and 
click the New Smart Collection icon (refer to Figure 3-1). The Smart 
Collection dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 3-9.
At the top of the dialog box, you find 
the Look In pop-up menu. Locate 
your hard disk(s) using this menu. 
In the Criteria section, choose from 
a vast list of criteria in the first pop-
up menu. The second menu where 
you see contains in Figure 3-9 offers 
options for meeting the criteria 
(such as contains, does not contain, 
equals, and so on). The last item is 
either a text box or menu, depend­
ing on the criteria you used for 
searching. Type a value or choose a 
menu item similar to the examples 
shown in Figure 3-9.
Figure 3-9: The Smart Collection dialog box.

Stack ’Em Up
If you want to specify more criteria, 
click the + (plus) button. To delete a 
line, click the – (minus) button. When 
you’re finished, click Save, and your 
new Smart Collection is added to the 
Collections pane (as shown in Figure 
3-10). Name the collection. Then you 
can add photos to a Smart Collection by 
specifying criteria (as just described); 
delete photos just as you would do with 
any collection.
Stack ’Em Up
With rapid-fire digital cameras and 
no need to concern yourself with film-
processing costs, you might take five, ten, or more photos of the same 
scene. To help economize the space in the Bridge window, you can easily 
stack images so that only a single thumbnail appears in the window.
To create a stack, select several photos and choose Stacks➪Group as Stack. 
When the stack is created, all the selected photos are tucked in behind the 
first image in the stack. To view photos after stacking, choose Stacks➪
Ungroup from Stack.
By using keyboard shortcuts, you can expand and collapse stacks easily. Use 
Ô+right arrow to expand a stack you select in the Bridge window, and all 
thumbnail images within the stack are displayed. To collapse a stack, select 
one of the images in the stack and press Ô+left arrow.
If you want to remove the stack, choose Stacks➪Ungroup from Stack or 
press Shift+Ô+G.
Creating Slide Shows
Slide shows in Adobe Bridge are handled by one of two options. You can 
view a slide show of selected files directly in the Bridge window — in which 
case the slide show is not saved as a file — or you can export photos to a 
PDF document. Using the latter option, you can save the slide show and add 
transitions so it looks like slide shows you’re familiar with.

Outputting Files
To view photos as a slide show in Adobe Bridge, select the photos you want 
to display and choose View➪Slideshow or press Ô+L. Your selected photos 
jump into a full-screen view and 
scroll automatically according to 
settings you make for the slide 
show. To exit the slide show, press 
the Esc key.
By default, each slide is displayed 
for five seconds. You can change the 
duration (and other attributes of 
slide shows) by choosing View➪
Slideshow Options or by pressing 
Shift+Ô+L. The Slideshow Options 
dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 3-11.
Slide shows in Bridge are intended 
for your personal use. If you want to 
share slide shows with other users, 
you have to output the slides as a 
file.
Outputting Files
You can output files from Adobe Bridge in either PDF format or as a Web 
Gallery. With PDF outputs, you have a few different choices. You can save 
your pictures as a PDF slide show or as greeting cards, contact sheets, and 
layouts that you specify with assorted options.
Your output options are selected in the Output pane in Adobe Bridge. Click 
the Output icon at the top of the Bridge window, and your workspace 
changes, as shown in Figure 3-12 (where the Output icon is also labeled). In 
the center of the Bridge window, you see an output preview. On the right 
side of the window, you find the Output tab. From the Template drop-down 
list, you choose the type of output you want.
There are a few general things to remember when saving files as Adobe PDF. 
You first select photos in the Bridge window and then open the Output tab 
by clicking the Output icon. You make choices for the output you want from 
the Template drop-down list. If you don’t want the filename and filename 
extension to be displayed on your output, scroll down to the Overlays panel 
and uncheck Filename and Extension. Click the Refresh Preview button to

update previews as you make choices for the pictures used or the attributes 
assigned to the output. When finished, you scroll the tabs on the right side 
of the Bridge window and click the Save button at the bottom of the pane.

Figure 3-12: The Output tab handles a variety of options for saving files as Adobe PDF.
Outputting slide shows
Slide shows are saved as PDF files from within Adobe Bridge; however, you 
can choose to output your images as a slide show from within Bridge or 
from within Edit Full mode in Elements. If you’re working in Elements, you 
click the Create tab and click PDF Slideshow. Elements then switches you to 
Adobe Bridge, and the display changes from the current display to a 
Filmstrip display. 
To compare the displays, look back at Figure 3-1. The display in Figure 3-1 is

Outputting to a Web Gallery
Web Galleries are collections of photos that you can export to HTML, com­
plete with HTML code and the images you’ve chosen for Web hosting. 
Elements makes creating Web Galleries easy, even if you have no experience 
with creating Web pages.
You can create a Web Gallery by first clicking the Output icon in Adobe 
Bridge (refer to Figure 3-12) and then clicking the Web Gallery button in the 
Output pane. You can also start by clicking the Create button in Elements 
and then choosing Web Photo Gallery. If you start from within Elements, 
you’re switched automatically to Adobe Bridge, where you create the Web 
Gallery.
Web Galleries in Adobe Bridge support a number of different templates and 
styles for creating the appearance of the end product. The best way to 
explore the options is to select photos in Bridge, and then choose a

hen you open a picture in Photoshop Elements, you’re looking at a 
huge mass of pixels. These pixels are tiny, colored squares, and the 
number of pixels in a picture determines the picture’s resolution. This rela­
tionship between pixels and resolution — important to understand in all 
your Elements work — relates to creating selections (as we explain in Book 
IV, Chapters 1 and 2), printing files (Book IX, Chapter 2), and sharing files.
This chapter explains some essential points about resolution and image 
sizes, especially in terms of how these aspects affect how you 
end up modifying your images.
Examining Images Closely
Files you open in Elements are composed of millions 
of tiny, square pixels. Each pixel has one, and only 
one, color value. The arrangement of the pixels of 
different shades and colors creates an illusion for 
your eyes when you’re viewing an image onscreen. 
For example, you may have black and white pixels 
arranged in an order that creates the impression that 
you’re looking at something gray — not at all those tiny 
black and white squares.
Just about everything you do in Elements has to do with chang­
ing pixels. You surround them with selection tools to select what 
appear to be objects in your image; you make pixels darker or lighter to 
change contrast and brightness; you change the shades and tints of pixels 
for color correction; and you perform a host of other possible editing tasks.

174
Examining Images Closely
We also have another term to throw at you when talking about pixels and 
Elements files: Your pictures are raster images. When you have pixels, you 
have raster data. If you open a file in Elements that isn’t made of pixels, 
Elements can rasterize the data. In other words, Elements can convert other 
data to pixels if the document wasn’t originally composed of pixels.
	
In addition to raster data, there’s also vector data, which we talk more about 
later in this chapter.
	
To use most of the tools and commands in Elements, you must be working 
on a raster image file. If your data isn’t rasterized, many tools and com­
mands are unavailable.
Understanding resolution
The number of pixels in a file determines its image resolution. If you have 72 
pixels across a 1-inch horizontal line, your image is 72 pixels per inch (ppi). 
If you have 300 pixels in 1 inch, your image resolution is 300 ppi.
	
Image resolution is critical to properly outputting files in these instances:
	
✓	When you print images: If the resolution is too low, the image prints 
poorly. If the image resolution is too high, you waste time processing all 
the data that needs to be sent to your printer.
	
✓	When you show images onscreen: Just as an image has an inherent 
resolution in its file, your computer monitor has an inherent — fixed — 
resolution at which it displays everything you see onscreen. Computer 
monitors display images at 72 ppi (or 85 or 96 ppi). That’s all you get. 
What’s important to know is that you can always best view photos on 
your computer monitor at a 72-ppi image size in a 100-percent view.
	
	As an example, take a look at Figure 1-1: You see an image reduced to 
50 percent and then at different zoom sizes. When the size changes, the 
resolution display on your monitor changes. When the size is 100 per­
cent, you see the image exactly as it will print. The 100-percent size rep­
resents the image displayed on your monitor at 72 ppi, regardless of the 
resolution of the file.
This relationship between the image resolution and viewing the image at dif­
ferent zoom levels is tricky but vital. If (for example) you grab an image off 
the Web and zoom in on it, you may see a view like the 800-percent view 
shown in Figure 1-1. If you acquire a digital camera image, you may need to 
zoom out to a 16-percent view to fit the entire image into the Image window.

Figure 1-1: The same image viewed at different zoom levels.
These displays vary so much because of image resolution. That Web page 
image you grabbed off the Web might be a 2-inch-square image at 72 ppi, and 
that digital camera image might be a 10-x-15-inch image at 240 ppi. You have 
to zoom in on the image if you want to fill the entire window with it — but 
when you zoom in, the resolution is lowered. The more you zoom in, the 
lower the resolution on your monitor.
	
When you zoom into or out of an image, you change the resolution as it 
appears on your monitor. No resolution changes are made to the file. The 
image resolution remains the same until you use one of the Elements tools to 
reduce or increase image resolution.
Understanding image dimensions
Image dimensions involve the physical size of your file. If the size is 4 x 5 
inches, for example, the file can be any number of different resolution val­
ues. After the file is open in Elements, you can change the dimensions of an 
image, the resolution, or both.
When you change only the dimensions of an image (not the number of pixels 
it contains), an inverse relationship exists between the physical size of your 
image and the resolution: As image size increases, resolution decreases. 
Conversely, when you raise resolution, you reduce the image size.

176
Using the Image Size Command
Understanding camera megapixels
Digital-camera image resolution is measured in megapixels (millions of 
pixels) and is a factor in image size. If you have a 6-megapixel camera, the 
full-resolution images from your camera are about 3000 x 2000 pixels. The 
file size for a 6-megapixel image is about 5.7MB.
On the screen, the resolution of many digital camera images is 72 ppi (pixels 
per inch). Using the 6-megapixel image as an example, the resolution at 72 
ppi produces an image that measures a little more than 41 x 27 inches. 
Regardless of whether your camera takes pictures at 3, 5, or 8 megapixels, 
many images are captured at 72 ppi, but the dimensions vary according to 
the total number of pixels captured. With other cameras, you may find image 
resolutions like 230 ppi or some other variation. The higher resolutions typi­
cally produce images of smaller physical sizes.
Looking at raster versus vector images
Elements supports working with vector data in addition to raster data. 
Whereas raster data carries with it a fixed resolution, vector objects are not 
resolution dependent. What does this mean and, more important, what 
advantages come from working with vector data?
A vector object might be a line of text or a shape you add to a photo from an 
assortment of vector shapes. When you size text and shapes in Elements, 
the resizing has no effect on resolution. In other words, you can make a line 
of text or a shape as large as you want, and when the photo is printed, the 
text and shapes print clearly without distortion. Text and shapes remain res­
olution independent until you flatten the layers. Then the shapes are con­
verted to pixels and appear as raster images.
Using the Image Size Command
In some cases, an image is too large, and you need to reduce its resolution, 
physical size, or both. In other cases, you might need a higher resolution to 
output an image at a larger size. This method of sizing — changing the size, 
as well as the number of pixels — is called resampling an image.
	
You can reduce resolution by sampling fewer pixels (downsampling) or raise 
resolution by adding more pixels to the sample (upsampling).
	
Use caution when you resample images; when you resample, you’re either 
tossing away pixels or manufacturing new pixels — and neither activity par­
ticularly benefits image quality. We discuss the sampling details in the section 
“Upsampling images,” later in this chapter.

177
Book III 
Chapter 1

lution and Changing 
Image Sizing
Using the Image Size Command
Downsampling images
You can change an image’s size and resolution in a couple different ways. 
One method involves cropping images. You can use the Crop tool with or 
without resampling images. (For more information on using the Crop tool, 
see Book VIII, Chapter 1.) Another method involves the Image Size dialog 
box, which you use in many of your editing sessions in Elements.
When you use the Image Size dialog box to size an image down, you are 
downsampling the image. Follow these steps to see how downsampling is 
performed in Elements:
	
1.	 Open a photo in Edit Full mode.
	
	 Any photo you have handy can be used to follow the steps here.
	
2.	 Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size.
	
	 Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+I (Ô+Option+I 
on a Mac). The Image Size dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 1-2.
	
	 The Pixel Dimensions area 
in the Image Size dialog box 
shows the file size (such as 
18.2MB [megabytes]). This num­
ber is the amount of space the 
image takes up on your hard 
drive. The width and height val­
ues are fixed unless you click 
the Resample Image check box 
at the bottom of the dialog box.
	
3.	 In the Document Size area, you 
can redefine dimensions and 
resolution. The options are
	
•	 Width: Type a value in the 
text box to resize the 
image’s width; then, to 
implement the change, press 
Tab to move out of the field. 
From the drop-down list to 
the right of the text box, you can choose a unit of measure: percent, 
inches, centimeters, millimeters, points, picas, or columns.
	
•	 Height: The Height options are the same as the Width options except 
there is no column setting. If you keep the sizing proportional — by 
checking the Constrain Proportions check box — you typically edit 
either the Width or Height text box, but not both. When you alter 
either width or height, the resolution changes inversely.
Figure 1-2: Choose Image➪Resize➪Image 
Size to open the Image Size dialog box.

178
Using the Image Size Command
	
•	 Resolution: Edit the text box to change resolution, and press the Tab 
key to change the value. When resolution is edited, the Width and 
Height values are changed inversely (if the Constrain Proportions 
check box is checked).
	
4.	 If you’re okay with resampling your image to get the desired size, 
select the Resample Image check box.
	
	 With this check box selected, you can change dimensions and pixels at 
the same time, which results in reducing or increasing the number of 
pixels. When the box is unchecked, the values for dimensions are linked. 
Changing one value automatically changes the other values.
	
	 Before you resample your image, however, be sure to check out the 
following section.
	
5.	 If you select the Resample Image check box, you can choose a resam­
pling method as well as other resampling options.
	
	 In the drop-down list, you find resampling-method choices. See Table 1-1 
for details. The two check boxes above the Resample Image check box 
become active when you select the Resample Image box. Here’s what 
they do:
	
•	 Scale Styles: Elements has a Styles panel from which you can add a 
variety of different style effects to images. When you apply a style, 
such as a frame border, the border appears at a defined width. When 
you select the Scale Styles box and then resize the image, the Styles 
effect is also resized. Leaving the check box unselected keeps the 
style at the same size when the image is resized.
	
•	 Constrain Proportions: By default, this check box is selected; keep it 
that way unless you want to distort an image intentionally.
	
6.	 When you’re done selecting your options, click OK to resize your 
image.

good-quality images and 
sharpens the results.
Downsample high-resolution 
images that need to be output to 
screen resolutions and Web pages.
Upsampling images
	
As a general rule, reducing resolution is okay, but increasing resolution isn’t. 
If you need a higher-resolution image and you can go back to the original 
source (such as rescanning the image or reshooting a picture), try (if you 
can) to create a new file that has the resolution you want instead of resam­
pling in Elements. In some cases, upsampled images can be severely 
degraded.
If you take a picture with a digital 
camera and want to add the picture 
to a Web page, the image needs to 
be sampled at 72 ppi. In most cases, 
you visit the Image Size dialog box, 
select the Resample Image check 
box, add a width or height value, 
and type 72 in the Resolution text 
box. What you end up with is an 
image that looks great on your Web 
page. In Figure 1-3, you can see an 
image that was downsampled in 
Elements from more than 14 inches 
horizontal width.
	
If you start with an image that was originally sampled for a Web page and 
you want to print a large poster, you can forget about using Elements or any 
other image editor. Upsampling low-resolution images often turns them to 
mush, as shown in Figure 1-4.
Figure 1-3: Downsampling images usually 
produces satisfactory results.

Using the Scale Command
You might wonder whether upsam­
pling can be used for any purpose. 
In some cases, yes, you can upsam­
ple with some satisfactory results. 
You can experience better results 
with higher resolutions of 300 ppi 
and more if the resample size isn’t 
extraordinary. If all else fails, try 
applying a filter to a grainy, upsam­
pled image to mask the problem. 
(Book VII, Chapter 1 has the details 
on filters.)
	
Some third-party tools do much bet­
ter with upsampling images than the 
built-in sampling tools provided by Elements. For starters, take a look at 
OnOne Software’s Genuine Fractals (www.ononesoftware.com). When it is 
absolutely necessary to upsample images, you’ll find favorable results using 
this product.
Using the Scale Command
When you open a photo in Elements, the photo rests on an underlying layer 
called the canvas. The canvas and the photo are at a 1:1 ratio. In essence, the 
canvas is the physical size of your image. You can keep the canvas size fixed 
while upsizing or downsizing the photo image. To do so requires using the 
Transformation tools.
Choose Image➪Transform➪Free Transform or press Ctrl+T (Ô+T on a Mac), 
and you see a number of handles on the sides of the transformation rectan­
gle. To scale a photo up or down, grab one of the four-corner handles by 
clicking one and holding down the mouse button; then you can move the 
handle in or out to size the image down or up, respectively.
If you open a context menu after you’ve selected Free Transform, you find 
several transformation commands as shown in Figure 1-5. Choose the Scale 
command to size an image up or down. As you drag the corner handles, the 
scaling is made while constraining proportions.
The end result of scaling images is the same as using the Image Size dialog 
box to upsample and downsample images. As you scale an image up, the 
image loses resolution. As you scale an image down, it gains resolution. 
Therefore, when scaling images up, be certain that the image resolution is 
sufficient to support the new size.

often produces severely degraded results.

Choosing a Resolution for Print or Screen
Choosing a Resolution for Print or Screen
The importance of resolution in your Elements work is paramount when 
printing files. Good ol’ 72-ppi images can be forgiving, and you can get many 
of your large files scrunched down to 72 ppi for Web sites and slide shows. 
With output to printing devices, it’s another matter. There are many differ­
ent printing output devices, and their resolution requirements vary.
For your own desktop printer, plan to print a variety of test images at differ­
ent resolutions. You can quickly determine the best file attributes by run­
ning tests. When you send files to service centers, ask the technicians what 
file attributes work best with their equipment.
For a starting point, look over the recommended resolutions for various out­
put devices listed in Table 1-2.

Changing the Canvas Size
When you scale images, you maintain the same canvas size. You might 
(for example) have a canvas size set up for printing a photo — say, 8 x 10 
inches — and want to make an image a bit larger on the canvas. You might 
also add other images to create a photo collage and need to scale those 
added images up or down, again keeping the same canvas size.
For that matter, you might want to keep the image size the same but increase 
the canvas size to accommodate an area to include type, some content from 
the Content palette, or additional images.

Image Sizing
Changing the Canvas Size
To increase the canvas size, choose Image➪Resize➪Canvas Size. The Canvas 
Size dialog box opens (as shown in Figure 1-7). In this dialog box, you have 
several options to control, such as
	
✓	Current Size: The display for the Current Size shows you what your orig­
inal canvas size is when you open the dialog box.
	
✓	Width: Type the new width in the text box.
	
✓	Height: Type the new Height in the text box.
	
✓	Relative: By default, the new size is absolute. Check this box if you want 
the new size relative to the dimensions.
	
✓	Anchor: By default, the canvas is increased from the center out. For 
example, if you have a 3 x 3-inch canvas area and you increase the size 
to 5 x 5 inches, one inch of canvas is added to all four sides of the photo. 
By clicking one of the arrows shown in the Anchor area, you can size the 
canvas relative to the photo from the top-left corner, top, top-right cor­
ner, left side, right side, bottom-left corner, bottom, or 
bottom-right corner.
	
✓	Canvas Extension Color: From the drop-down list, you can choose the 
current background, foreground, or some preset values for the color of 
the new canvas area. If you want a custom color, click the color swatch 
to the right of the drop-down list and make a new color selection from 
the pop-up color wheel.

Changing the Canvas Size
In Figure 1-8, we added some canvas area to make the total size of the photo 
8 x 10 inches. The new canvas color is the same color as the background 
color.

R
egardless of what output you prepare your files for, you have to con­
sider color mode and file format. The most common color mode for 
photos taken with a digital camera is RGB (red, green, blue); you use it to 
prepare color files for printing on your desktop color printer or for sending 
to photo-service centers.
You can also use color modes other than RGB — bitmap or grayscale, for 
example. If you start with an RGB color image and want to convert to a 
different color mode, you have menu options for doing precisely that. 
Photoshop Elements uses an algorithm (a mathematical formula) to 
convert pixels from one mode to another. In some cases, the 
conversion that’s made via a menu command produces 
good results; in other cases, you can use some different 
options for converting modes.
In this chapter, we introduce the modes that are 
available in Elements and explain how to convert 
from RGB to the mode of your choice: bitmap, gray­
scale, or indexed color. File formats are also some­
what dependent on which color mode you choose 
for your files, so we tossed in a discussion about 
saving files in this chapter.
Selecting a Color Mode
When you open an image from a digital camera or scan an image, 
the image file contains a color mode. Typically, digital camera images are in 
RGB color mode. When you scan documents and photos on a scanner, you 
can choose from among line art (bitmap mode), grayscale, or RGB color.

186
Converting Color Modes and Profiles
	
Another mode you may have heard of is CMYK. Although CMYK mode isn’t 
available in Photoshop Elements, you should be aware of it and its uses. 
CMYK, commonly referred to as process color, contains percentages of cyan, 
magenta, yellow, and black colors. This mode is used for commercial print­
ing and also on many desktop printers. If you design a magazine cover in 
Elements and send the file to a print shop, the file is ultimately converted to 
CMYK. Also note that most desktop printers use different ink sets within the 
CMYK color space.
If you start in Edit Full mode and create a new blank document, you have a 
choice for defining the color mode of the new document. Choose File➪New➪
Blank File, and the New dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-1. At the 
bottom of the dialog box, you make 
a choice for the color mode from 
the Color Mode drop-down list.
When choosing a color mode, the 
options you have for importing 
images from digital camera shots, 
scanning images, and creating new 
documents are limited to the modes 
discussed thus far. To explore other 
modes or change a mode, you have 
to work with menu commands for 
converting color.
Converting Color Modes and Profiles
The most common scenario for photographers and users of Photoshop 
Elements is to start out with an RGB color image. This color mode is the cen­
ter of your mode universe — and from here you can convert from RGB to 
other color modes.
Converting to Bitmap mode
Bitmap mode is most commonly used in printing line art, such as black-and-
white logos, illustrations, or black-and-white effects that you create from 
your RGB images. Also, you can scan your analog signature as a bitmap 
image and import it into other programs, such as Microsoft Office programs. 
If you’re especially creative, you can combine bitmap images with RGB color 
to produce many interesting effects.
	
The Elements Bitmap mode isn’t the same as the Windows BMP file format. 
In Elements, Bitmap mode is a color mode with only two color values — 
black and white. A Windows BMP file can be an image in RGB, Grayscale, or 
Bitmap color mode.
Figure 2-1: Define the color mode for a new 
blank document with the New dialog box.

Converting Color Modes and Profiles
	
When you’re working with color modes, keep in mind that when you com­
bine images into single documents (as we explain throughout Book VI), you 
have to convert bitmap files to grayscale or color if you want to merge those 
images with an RGB image. If you convert to grayscale, Elements takes care 
of converting grayscale to RGB mode.
For an example of what happens when you combine grayscale and color 
images, look over Figure 2-2: The original RGB image was converted to a 
bitmap and then saved as a different file. The bitmap was converted to 
grayscale and dropped on top of the 
RGB image. Adjusting the opacity 
produced a grainy effect with desat­
urated color. (For more information 
on how to merge files, create layers, 
and blend the opacity of layers, see 
Book VI, Chapters 1 through 3.)
You can acquire Bitmap mode 
images directly in Elements when 
you scan images that are originally 
black and white — such as line art, 
logos, your signature, or a copy of a 
fax — in Bitmap mode. Additionally, 
you can convert your RGB color 
images to Bitmap mode.
Converting RGB color to bitmap is a 
two-step process. You first convert 
to grayscale and then convert from 
grayscale to bitmap. If you select 
the Bitmap menu command while in 
RGB color, Elements prompts you to 
convert to grayscale first.
To convert RGB mode to Bitmap 
mode, do the following:
	
1.	 Open an image that you want to convert to Bitmap mode, using either 
Edit Full or Edit Quick mode.
	
2.	 Choose Image➪Mode➪Bitmap.
	
	 If you start in RGB mode, Elements prompts you to convert to Grayscale.
	
3.	 Click OK.
	
	 The Bitmap dialog box opens, providing options for selecting the output 
resolution and a conversion method.

bitmap file and an RGB file.

Converting Color Modes and Profiles
	
4.	 Select a resolution.
	
	 By default, the Bitmap dialog 
box (as shown in Figure 2-3) 
displays the current resolution. 
You can edit the text box and 
type a new resolution value or 
accept the default.
	
5.	 Under the Method heading, 
select one of the following 
settings from the Use drop-
down list:
	
•	 50% Threshold
	
•	 Pattern Dither
	
•	 Diffusion Dither
	
	 For more about dithering color, see the “Converting to Indexed Color 
mode” section later in this chapter. Look over Figure 2-4 to see a compari­
son of the different methods used in converting RGB images to bitmaps.

Converting Color Modes and Profiles
Converting to Grayscale mode
Grayscale images have black and white pixels and any one of 256 levels of 
gray. By converting an RGB image to grayscale, you can make it look like a 
black-and-white photo.
	
We talk about 256 gray levels in many chapters in this book. An RGB color 
image is divided into three separate channels (one for red, one for green, 
and one for blue). Each of these channels contains 256 levels of grays. 
Adjusting the levels of grays will affect the brightness and color in your 
images. (Look over Book VIII, Chapter 2 to understand more about the gray 
levels and adjusting them in Photoshop Elements.)
	
You can convert an image to grayscale in one of three ways, but we’re here 
to tell you that one of these methods isn’t as good as the others. In other 
words, avoid converting to grayscale by choosing Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. 
When Elements performs this conversion, it removes all the color from the 
pixels, so you lose some precious data during the conversion. You can’t 
regain this color after conversion. If you use the Image➪Mode➪Grayscale 
command sequence to convert an image to grayscale and then save the file 
and delete the original from your hard drive or memory card, the color 
image is lost forever. You can save a secondary file, but this method is con­
fusing and requires some more space on your hard drive. Here’s a better 
way. . . .
As an alternative to using the menu command for converting images to gray­
scale, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open an RGB image in Elements.
	
2.	 Duplicate a layer.
	
	 The default Project Bin contains the Layers panel. In this panel, you find 
a pop-up menu when you click More in the upper-right corner. From the 
menu commands, choose Duplicate Layer. (For more information on 
working with layers, see Book VI, Chapter 1.) After duplicating the layer, 
you see a thumbnail of another layer in the Layers panel.
	
3.	 Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation (or press 
Ctrl+U [Ô+U on the Mac]) to open the Hue/Saturation dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 2-5.
	
4.	 Drag the Saturation slider to the far left to desaturate the image.
	
	 All color disappears, but the brightness values of all the pixels remain 
unaffected. (For more information on using the Hue/Saturation dialog 
box and the other Adjust Color commands, see Book VIII, Chapter 2.)

190
Converting Color Modes and Profiles
	
5.	 Turn off the color layer by 
clicking the Eye icon.
	
	 In the Layers panel, you see two 
layers, as shown in Figure 2-6. 
You don’t need to turn off the 
color layer to print the file in 
grayscale, but turning it off can 
help you remember which color 
layer you used the last time you 
printed or exported the file.
Following the steps just given pro­
vides you with a file that contains 
both RGB and grayscale. If you want 
to print the color layer, you can turn 
off the grayscale layer. If you need to 
exchange files with graphic design­
ers, you can send the layered file, 
and then the design professional can 
use both the color image and the gray­
scale image.
The other advantage of converting 
RGB color to grayscale by using the 
Hue/Saturation dialog box is that you 
don’t cause any changes in the bright­
ness values of the pixels. Moving the 
Saturation slider to desaturate the 
image affects only the color. The 
brightness values remain the same.
Another choice you have for convert­
ing color to black-and-white photos is 
to use the Convert to Black and White 
dialog box. Choose Enhance➪Convert 
to Black and White in either Edit Full 
mode or Edit Quick mode, and you see 
the Convert to Black and White dialog 
box shown in Figure 2-7.
This dialog box contains many controls for adjusting brightness and con­
trast in images that you convert to grayscale. You can select from some 
preset options in the Select a Style list. You move the sliders in the Adjust 
Intensity area and see a dynamic preview displayed in the After thumbnail 
area.
Figure 2-6: The Layers panel shows the 
grayscale and color layers. Click the Eye 
icon to turn layers on or off.

move the Saturation slider to the far left to 
eliminate color.

If you want to keep your original RGB image in the same file as the grayscale 
version, duplicate the background by right-clicking a layer in the Layers 
panel and choosing Duplicate Layer from the context menu. Alternatively, 
you can drag a layer to the Create new layer icon at the bottom-left corner in 
the Layers panel. Then click the background and choose Enhance➪Convert 
to Black and White. The conversion is applied only to the background, leav­
ing the Background copy layer in the original color mode.
Converting to Indexed Color mode
Indexed color is a mode you use occasionally with Web graphics, such as 
saving in GIF format or PNG-8. When saving indexed-color images, you can 
often create smaller file sizes than using RGB. These are ideal for using in 
Web site designs.
RGB images in 24-bit color (8 bits per channel) can render colors from a pal­
ette of 16.7 million colors. An indexed color image is an 8-bit image with only 
a single channel. The total number of colors you get with indexed color can 
be no more than 256. When you convert RGB images to indexed color, you 

192
Converting Color Modes and Profiles
can choose to dither the color, which displays the image with a dithered 
effect much like the effect you see with bitmapped images. This dithering 
effect makes the file appear as though it has more than 256 colors, and the 
transition between colors appears smoother than it would if no dithering 
were applied.
On occasion, indexed-color images have an advantage over RGB images 
when you’re hosting the images on Web servers: The fewer colors in a file, 
the smaller the file size and the faster the image loads. When you prepare 
images for Web hosting, you can choose to use indexed color or RGB color. 
Whether you choose one over the other really depends on the quality of the 
image as it appears on your monitor. If you have some photos that you want 
to show on Web pages, you should use RGB images and save them in a for­
mat appropriate for Web hosting, as we explain in the section “Saving files 
for the Web,” later in this chapter.
If you have files composed of artwork, such as logos, illustrations, and draw­
ings, you may find that the appearance of images using indexed colors is no 
different from the same images as RGB. If that’s the case, you can keep the 
indexed-color image and use it for your Web pages.
To convert RGB images to indexed color, choose Image➪Mode➪Indexed 
Color; the Indexed Color dialog box opens. Various options are available to 
you; fortunately, you can preview the results while you make choices. Get in 
and poke around. You can see the options applied in the Image window.
Converting color profiles
Because we’re talking about color conversions in this chapter, we also cover 
a little bit about color profiles (and converting color profiles) here. But for a 
more thorough discussion of color profiles, jump to Book III, Chapter 4.
Some image files contain embedded color profiles; an example is the one 
shown later in Figure 2-8, where the embedded profile is shown in the Save 
As dialog box as ColorMatchRGB. That color profile isn’t available in 
Photoshop Elements; it was embedded in another program that supported 
profile embedding for the ColorMatchRGB profile.
Photoshop Elements can embed either one of two different color profiles in a 
photo: RGB and sRGB. The Adobe RGB profile uses a slightly larger color 
gamut (more available colors) than sRGB. Some printing devices work best 
when converting sRGB color to the printer’s color. Other printers offer bet­
ter support for Adobe RGB. (This is a nutshell view of color profiling for 
printing. For more detailed information, see Book IX, Chapter 2.)

193
Book III 
Chapter 2
Choosing  
Color Modes and 
File Formats
Using the Proper File Format
Going back to Figure 2-8, if you want to print the file to a printer, you might 
want to convert the color profile. To do so, you choose Image➪Convert 
Color Profile and then make a choice from the submenu. Your options 
include
	
✓	Remove Profile: Choosing this option removes the color profile from 
the image.
	
✓	Convert to sRGB Profile: This choice applies the sRGB profile to the 
image.
	
✓	Convert to Adobe RGB: This option applies the Adobe RGB color profile 
to the image.
Choosing one of these options either removes a color profile or converts to 
the selected color profile. When you save your file, you have the option to 
embed the profile in the image.
Using the Proper File Format
As you edit your image files, be sure you save frequently to update the work 
performed in your editing sessions. Continue saving as your work pro­
gresses to ensure against data loss.
Photoshop Elements files can be saved in a variety of different formats. 
Some format types require you to convert a color mode before the format 
can be used. Therefore, a relationship exists between the color modes pres­
ent in files and saving those files in formats that support those color modes. 
Additionally, bit depths (see Book III, Chapter 4 for more information on bit 
depth) in images also relate to the kinds of file formats you can use when 
saving files.
Before you go too far in Elements, become familiar with file formats and the 
conversions necessary to save in one format or another. If you don’t convert 
an image’s modes or change its bit depth, you can save an edited file in the 
same format in which you opened it. Often, however, if you open an image 
and prepare it for some form of output, you have to give more thought to the 
kind of file format you should use when saving the file.
Using the Save/Save As dialog box
In almost any program, the Save (or Save As) dialog box is a familiar place 
where you make some choices about the file to be saved. With Save As, you 
can save a duplicate copy of your image or save a modified copy and retain 
the original file.

194
Using the Proper File Format
To use the Save (or Save As) dialog 
box, choose File➪Save for files to 
be saved the first time, or choose 
File➪Save As for any file, and a 
dialog box opens (as shown in 
Figure 2-8).
The standard navigational tools you 
find in any Save dialog box appear in 
the Elements Save/Save As dialog 
box. Here are some standard 
options you find in the Elements 
Save/Save As dialog box:
	
✓	File Name (Save As on the 
Mac): This item is common to all 
Save dialog boxes. Type a name 
for your file in the text box.
	
✓	Format: From the drop-down menu, you select file formats. We explain 
the formats supported by Elements in the section “Understanding file 
formats,” later in this chapter.
A few options make the Photoshop Elements Save/Save As dialog box differ­
ent from other Save dialog boxes that you might be accustomed to using. 
The Save Options area in the Save As dialog box provides these choices:
	
✓	Include in the Organizer (Windows): If you want the file added to the 
Organizer, select this check box. (For more information about using the 
Organizer, see Book II, Chapter 2.)
	
✓	Save in Version Set with Original (Windows): You can edit images and 
save a version of your image, but only in Edit Quick mode. When you 
save the file from Edit Quick mode, this check box is active. Select the 
box to save a version of the original, which appears in the Organizer.
	
✓	Color: Check the box for ICC (International Color Consortium) Profile. 
Depending on which profile you’re using, the option appears for sRGB or 
Adobe RGB (1998). When the check box is selected, the profile is embed­
ded in the image. (See “Converting Color Modes and Profiles,” earlier in 
this chapter.)
	
✓	Thumbnail (Windows): If you save a file with a thumbnail, you can see a 
miniature representation of your image when viewing it in folders or on 
the desktop. If you select Ask When Saving in the Saving Files prefer­
ences, the check box can be enabled or disabled. If you select an option 
for Never Save or Always Save in the Preferences dialog box, this box is 
enabled or disabled (and grayed out). You have to return to the 
Preferences dialog box if you want to change the option.

Using the Proper File Format
	
✓	Use Lower Case Extension (Windows): File extensions give you a clue to 
which file format was used when a file was saved. Elements automati­
cally adds the extension to the filename for you. Your choices are to use 
uppercase or lowercase letters for the extension name. Select the check 
box for Use Lower Case Extension for lowercase; deselect the check box 
if you want to use uppercase characters in the filename.
Understanding file formats
When you save files from Elements, you pick a file format in the Format 
drop-down list found in both the Save and Save As dialog boxes.
	
When you choose from the different format options, keep the following infor­
mation in mind:
	
✓	File formats are especially important when you exchange files with other 
users. Each format has a purpose, and other programs can accept or 
reject files depending on the format you choose.
	
✓	Whether you can select one format or another for saving a file depends 
on the color mode, the bit depth, and whether layers are present. If a 
format isn’t present in the Format drop-down list when you attempt to 
save a file, return to one of the edit modes and perform some kind of 
edit, such as changing a color 
mode or flattening layers, in order 
to save the file in your chosen 
format.
For a glimpse at all the file formats 
available to you, open a standard RGB 
color image in Standard Edit mode, 
choose File➪Save As, and click the 
down arrow to open the Format drop-
down list. As you can see in Figure 2-9, 
you have many format options.
In the following sections, we explain 
most of the file formats supported by 
Elements and the purpose for each 
format.
Photoshop (*.PSD, *.PDD)
This format is the native file format for both Photoshop and Photoshop 
Elements. The format supports saving all color modes and bit depths, and 
you can preserve layers. Use this format when you want to save in a native 
format or exchange files with Photoshop users. Also use it for saving files 
Figure 2-9: Open the Format drop-down list 
in either the Save or Save As dialog box to 
make the formats supported by Elements 
appear.

that you want to return to for more editing. When you save layers, any text 
you add to layers can be edited when you return to the file. (See Book V, 
Chapter 3 for more information on adding text to an image.)
Alias PIX (Macintosh)
This format was introduced by Wavefront Technologies to import geometric 
data from ASCII files.
BMP (*.BMP, *.RLE, *.DIB)
The term bitmap can be a little confusing. You have both a file format type 
that’s bitmap and a color mode that’s also bitmap. Don’t confuse the two. The 
bitmap format supports saving in all color modes and in all bit depths. The 
Bitmap color mode, which we cover in the section “Converting to Bitmap 
mode,” earlier in this chapter, is 1-bit black-and-white only.
Use the bitmap format when you want to add images to system resources, 
such as wallpaper for your desktop. Bitmap is also used with many different 
application programs. If you can’t import images in other program docu­
ments, try to save them as BMP files.
CompuServe GIF (*.GIF)
Back when CompuServe was the host for our e-mail accounts, Barb was a 
college coed and Ted had a mustache and wore a green leisure suit. We 
exchanged files and mail on 300-baud modems. Later, in 1987, CompuServe 
developed GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) to exchange files between 
mainframe computers and the ever-growing number of users working on 
Osborne, Kaypro, Apple, and Radio Shack TRS-80 computers.
GIF is now a popular format for hosting Web graphics. GIF images can be 
indexed color or animated images, and they support the smallest file sizes. 
Use this format when you need fewer than 256 colors and want to create ani­
mation in your images.
Photo Project Format (*.PSE)
Use this option when you create a project and want to save the file as a proj­
ect. See Book IX, Chapter 1 for more on creating projects in Elements.
Photoshop EPS (*.EPS)
Photoshop EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) files are sometimes used by 
graphic artists when they’re designing jobs for commercial printing. The 
more popular format for creative professionals is TIFF, but Photoshop EPS 
has some advantages not found in other formats.

Chapter 2
Choosing  
Color Modes and 
File Formats
Using the Proper File Format
Depending on the color mode of your image, you have different options 
when you’re using the Photoshop EPS file format. Select the format in the 
Save/Save As dialog box and click Save. If you’re working on a bitmap image 
(1 bit), the EPS Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-10, opens. It offers 
an option to save transparency wherever white appears in your document.
Notice the Transparent Whites 
check box. A typical use for it is to 
put a transparent area around a 
circular logo; here’s how it works: 
If you import the graphical image in 
another program, you can see the 
black in the image, but the entire 
white area is transparent and shows 
any background through what was 
white in the original bitmap image. If 
you save a file in a higher bit depth, 
the EPS Options dialog box doesn’t 
provide an option for making whites transparent.
IFF (Macintosh)
A generic file format introduced by Electronic Arts to ease the transfer of 
data between software produced by different companies.
JPEG (*.JPG, *.JPEG, *.JPE)
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is perhaps the most common file 
format now in use. JPEG files are used with e-mail attachments and by many 
photo labs for printing files, and they can be viewed in JPEG viewers or 
directly in Web browsers. Just about every program capable of importing 
images supports the JPEG format. Creative professionals wouldn’t dream of 
using the JPEG format in design layouts, but everyone else uses the format 
for all kinds of documents.
	
You need to exercise some caution when you’re using the JPEG format. JPEG 
files are compressed to reduce file size. You can scrunch an image of several 
megabytes into a few hundred kilobytes. When you save a file with JPEG 
compression, you experience data loss. You might not see this on your mon­
itor, or it might appear noticeably on photo prints if you’re using low com­
pression while preserving higher quality. However, when you save with 
maximum compression, more pixels are tossed away, and you definitely 
notice image degradation.
	
Every time you save, open, and resave images in JPEG format, the image 
degrades more. When you submit JPEG images to photo labs for printing 
your pictures, keep saving in Photoshop PSD file format until you’re ready to 
Figure 2-10: When you’re working on 1-bit 
bitmap images, this dialog box offers an option 
to save transparency where white appears in 
the document.

198
Using the Proper File Format
save the final image. Save that one in JPEG format — only when you want to 
save the final file for printing — and use a low compression with high 
quality.
When you select JPEG for the format and click Save, the JPEG Options dialog 
box opens, as shown in Figure 2-11. You choose the amount of compression 
by typing a value in the Quality text box or by moving the slider below the 
Quality text box. The acceptable ranges are from 0 to 12 — 0 is the lowest 
quality and highest compression, 
and 12 is the highest quality with 
the least compression.
Notice that you also have choices in 
the Format Options section of the 
JPEG Options dialog box. The 
Progressive option creates a pro­
gressive JPEG file commonly used 
with Web browsers: While the file 
downloads from a Web site, the 
image first appears in a low-quality 
view and then shows higher-resolu­
tion views as the download pro­
ceeds; the image appears at full 
resolution when it’s completely 
downloaded in your browser 
window.
PCX (*.PCX)
PCX is a native PC format first used with PC Paintbrush. Most programs now 
support newer file formats, and you’re not likely to need to save in PCX for­
mat. If you have legacy files from years ago, you can open PCX files in 
Elements, edit them, and save them in a newer format.
Photoshop PDF (*.PDF, *.PDP)
Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format) is designed to maintain document 
integrity when exchanging files between computers. PDF is one of the most 
popular formats and can be viewed in the free Adobe Reader program avail­
able for installation on your Elements CD Installer or by downloading it from 
the Adobe Web site.
PDF is everywhere in Elements. When you jump into Organize mode and cre­
ate slide presentations, cards, and calendars, for example, you can export 
your documents as PDF files. When you save in Photoshop PDF format, you 
can preserve layers and text. Text is recognizable in Adobe Reader (or other 
Acrobat viewers) and can be searched by using the Reader’s Find and 
Search tools.

choose the amount of compression you want 
to apply to the saved image.

Chapter 2
Choosing  
Color Modes and 
File Formats
Using the Proper File Format
PDF files can be printed, hosted on Web sites, and exchanged with users of 
Windows, Macintosh, Unix, and Linux. All in all, this format is well suited for 
all the files you create in Elements that contain text, layers, and transpar­
ency. It is also ideal when you want to exchange files with users who don’t 
have Elements or Photoshop.
Photoshop Raw (*.RAW)
This older format (introduced in 1989 with the first version of Adobe 
Photoshop) was specifically designed for exchanging files between the 
smaller computers of the day — microcomputers and personal computers 
(whether Windows or Mac) — and mainframe computers. Photoshop Raw 
isn’t used much today. Unless you prepare files to be viewed on mainframes, 
don’t bother saving in this format.
	
In recent years, with the advent of digital cameras, a different file format 
with “raw” in the name — Camera Raw — was introduced by Adobe and all 
the developers of digital cameras. The uses of Camera Raw (explained in 
Book III, Chapter 3) are completely different from those of Photoshop Raw. 
The two formats have nothing to do with each other.
PICT File (*.PCT, *.PICT)
PICT (Picture) format is an Apple file format similar to PCX on Windows. 
This format originated with the 1984 introduction of the Macintosh and the 
MacDraw program. This format is not used much today by any applications 
or output devices.
PICT Resource (Macintosh)
PICT images are stored as a Macintosh resource type. Apple Computer 
ended support for PICT and PICT Resource in 2009. The format is essentially 
not used with images today but is available for opening legacy files.
Pixar (*.PXR)
This format is used for exchanging files with Pixar workstations.
PNG (*.PNG)
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is another format used with Web pages. 
PNG supports all color modes, 24-bit images, and transparency. Some older 
browsers, however, may need a plug-in to see PNG files on Web pages. One 
disadvantage of using PNG is that color profiles can’t be embedded in the 
images, as they can be with JPEG. An advantage, however, is that PNG sup­
ports transparency.
Scitex CT (*.SCT)
The Scitex Continuous Tone (CT) format is used by Scitex workstations in 
commercial printing environments.

Using the Proper File Format
Targa (*.TGA, *.VDA, *.ICB, *.VST)
Targa is a format for describing bitmap images and is capable of represent­
ing bitmaps from black and white, indexed color, and RGB color. It’s used for 
applications that can read Targa files, such as Truevision’s hardware.
TIFF (*.TIF, *.TIFF)
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is the most common format used by graphic 
designers. TIFF is generally used for importing images in professional layout 
programs, such as Adobe InDesign and Adobe PageMaker. Commercial 
photo labs and print shops use equipment that supports downloading TIFF 
files directly to their devices. (Note: Direct downloads are used in lieu of 
opening a Print dialog box.)
Inasmuch as creative professionals have used TIFF for so long, a better 
choice for designers using a program such as Adobe InDesign is saving in the 
native Photoshop PSD file format. A creative professional need only save one 
file in native format; no need to save the same file in both native and TIFF 
formats.
Those who prefer to work in TIFF format should know that TIFF, along with 
Photoshop PSD and Photoshop PDF, supports saving layered files and works 
in all color modes. When you save in 
TIFF format, you can also compress 
files in several different compression 
schemes. Compression with TIFF 
files doesn’t lose data unless you 
choose a JPEG compression.
When you select TIFF for the format 
and click Save in the Save/Save As 
dialog box, the TIFF Options dialog 
box opens, as shown in Figure 2-12.
In the Image Compression area, you 
have these choices:
	
✓	NONE: Selecting this option 
results in no compression. You 
use this option when sending 
files to professionals who are 
creating layouts in programs 
such as Adobe InDesign. 
	
	Don’t use any of the compres­
sion schemes in the following 
bullets for printing files to com­
mercial printing devices.

drop-down list and click Save to open the TIFF 
Options dialog box.

✓	LZW: This lossless compression scheme results in much lower file sizes 
without destroying data.
	
✓	ZIP: ZIP is also a lossless compression scheme. You can favor ZIP compres­
sion over LZW when you have large areas of the same color in an image.
	
✓	JPEG: JPEG is lossy — the tradeoff is that losing some data from the 
image results in the smallest file sizes. Saving a file you created in some 
other format as a JPEG image has the same result as when you apply 
JPEG compression to files saved in the JPEG format: some data loss.
File formats at a glance
Since its introduction in 1989, Photoshop has remained capable of saving all 
the formats listed in this section. To date, we have never used all the formats 
available in Photoshop Elements. At most, you might use three or four of them.
	
You don’t need to remember all the formats and what each one does. Just 
pick the ones you use in your work, mark Table 2-1 for reference, and refer 
to it from time to time until you have a complete understanding of how your 
image files must be prepared and which formats you must use when you 
save them. If you happen to receive a file from another user in one of the for­
mats you don’t use, come back to the description in this chapter when you 
need some detail on what the format is used for.

Saving files for the Web
You save files for Web hosting in a special dialog box — the Save for Web 
dialog box. It offers other options than the dialog boxes you use to save files 
for other output. You can use the Save for Web dialog box to optimize files, 
but before you open it — in fact, before you even save a file, set the physical 
size and resolution of the image. Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size. In the 
dialog box that appears, you can adjust the dimensions and resolution. For 
Web graphics, choose a resolution such as 72 ppi and downsample the 
image if necessary. (For more about downsampling, see Book III, Chapter 1.)
After your image is resized, choose File➪Save for Web or press 
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S (Ô+Option+Shift+S on the Mac) to open the Save for Web 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-13. As you can see, you have a lot of things 
to control in this dialog box. The settings include

W
hen you work with digital photos in Elements, the file format of your 
images is an important point to consider. You choose this format 
before you take your pictures, and the format is carried over to your com­
puter when you pull images off your camera.
The most common file formats that digital cameras offer are JPEG, TIFF, and 
Camera Raw. Some cameras offer other options, but these formats are the 
most common. Low-cost, point-and-shoot cameras offer you only the JPEG 
format. The more expensive cameras, including the SLR types, offer you 
both JPEG and Camera Raw; some cameras offer JPEG and/or TIFF, 
and Camera Raw.
This chapter aims to give you an understanding of how 
to work with Camera Raw files.
Understanding Camera Raw
Cameras that produce JPEG images process images 
with JPEG compression before saving them. It’s as 
though your camera performs a darkroom method 
of film processing when the shot is taken.
The Camera Raw format provides you with an optimum 
image for editing in Elements. When a Camera Raw image 
is saved to a media source, all the information that the sensor 
captured is saved with the file; you process the images after you 
open them. (See the “Opening Camera Raw Files” section, later in this 
chapter, to find out about opening Camera Raw images.)

208
Understanding Camera Raw
For example, you can open a Camera Raw image and, before the image opens 
in Elements, you can adjust temperature, exposure, and a bunch of other 
settings — in effect, processing the photo after the shot was taken.
You can return to the original Camera Raw file and change the temperature 
or exposure (for example) to open the file with different settings to see how 
they affect the image. Just as chemical temperature and development time 
affect analog film processing, similar options affect post-processing Camera 
Raw images. The difference between analog film and Camera Raw is that 
after the analog film is processed, you can’t change the processing attri­
butes. With Camera Raw, you can go back and post-process the image 100 
times or more — and change the processing attributes each time.
Camera Raw also supports higher bit-depth images than JPEG files do. In 
Book III, Chapter 4, we talk about 8-bit and 16-bit images, including some of 
the advantages of using 16-bit images. Camera Raw files typically produce 
these higher bit-depth images that give you more flexibility when editing 
brightness, contrast, and color.
	
If you have a choice between just JPEG and both JPEG and Camera Raw, 
always choose the latter. You have much more editing control over your 
images — and ultimately you get better results.
Processing Camera Raw files
If you don’t have a camera capable of capturing Camera Raw images, you 
might want to look over the following sections to understand how this file 
format could benefit you. If you then end up purchasing a camera equipped 
with Camera Raw support, you already have some understanding of the 
advantages of using this format. (If you already have a Camera Raw-enabled 
camera, you don’t need any convincing!)
Camera Raw images enable you to post-process your pictures. When you 
take a picture with a digital camera in Camera Raw format, the camera’s sen­
sor records as much information as it can. When you open a Camera Raw file 
in Elements, you decide what part of that data is opened as a new image.
Suppose your camera is set for exposure in tungsten lighting (tungsten flash 
photography is common in studios). If you take this camera outside in day­
light and shoot an image without changing the settings, all your images 
appear with a blue cast because tungsten lighting requires a cooler color 
temperature than daylight.
If you acquire images that are saved in JPEG format, you have to do a lot of 
color correction after the image opens in Elements. If you shoot the image in 
Camera Raw format, you just process the image with a warmer temperature 

209
Book III
Chapter 3
Working with 
Camera Raw
Understanding Camera Raw
(consistent with conditions when the shot was taken), and your color 
correction in Elements happens in a fraction of the time it takes to fix a 
JPEG image.
Post-processing Camera Raw images requires a plug-in that’s installed 
with Photoshop Elements. When you open a Camera Raw image, the Camera 
Raw plug-in takes over and provides you with a huge set of options for post-
processing the image before you open it in one of the Elements Editors.
	
Each camera developer uses a different flavor of Camera Raw; some develop­
ers use different Camera Raw formats in different models in their product 
line. Although Adobe tries to keep up with all the various Raw formats, you 
may find a camera using a format not supported by the Raw plug-in. Be sure 
to check for updates online for Photoshop Elements. As new developments 
occur, Adobe makes an effort to update plug-ins to support newer formats.
Acquiring Camera Raw images
If you read through Chapters 1 and 2 in Book II, you know how to acquire 
images from your camera and copy them to your hard drive. We don’t 
bother going through those steps again; we just assume that you have some 
Camera Raw images on your hard drive. That’s where you want them any­
way. Opening files from your hard drive is much faster than working off 
media cards.
To open a Camera Raw image, follow these steps:
	
1.	 From within Elements, open the image by pressing Ctrl+O (Ô+O on 
the Mac) and selecting it in the Open dialog box.
	
	 If you want to select several images in a row, click the first image, hold 
down the Shift key, and then click the last image. If you want to select 
several nonadjacent images, Ctrl-click (Ô-click) each image.
	
	 As an alternative, if you imported images from a media card to your hard 
drive via the Organizer and have Camera Raw images in the Organizer 
window, select an image and choose Editor➪Edit Full (in the Options 
bar) or press Ctrl+I to open the converted raw file in Edit Full mode. In 
Adobe Bridge, you can open a Camera Raw image by choosing File➪
Open With➪Adobe Photoshop Elements 8.
	
2.	 Click Open in the Open dialog box.
	
	 If you’re selecting multiple images, only one image appears in the 
Camera Raw dialog box while thumbnails of all selected files appear in a 
scrollable list on the left side of the Camera Raw dialog box (as shown in 
Figure 3-1). When you click Open, the next image in the list opens in the 
Camera Raw dialog box.

210
Understanding Camera Raw
Figure 3-1: Open a Camera Raw image, and the image opens in the Camera Raw plug-in 
window.
	
	 As you can see in Figure 3-1, you can use a vast number of options to 
post-process your image before you drop it into Elements. This window 
is like a digital darkroom, where you can process the film and see what 
you’re doing to the image before you accept the changes.
	
3.	 Choose from the options to post-process your images.
	
	 If you have your monitor properly calibrated (as we explain in Book III, 
Chapter 4), all the adjustments you make for Camera Raw format are 
dynamically updated in the Image preview. Don’t be shy. Poke around 
and adjust settings to see the results in the Preview area. The more you 
play with the settings, the more you find out about how to get the best 
out of Camera Raw.
The Camera Raw window has a large number of settings, as the following list 
describes; mark this section to refer to when you work with Camera Raw 
images:
	
✓	Tools: Nine tools appear in the window:
	
•	 Zoom: This tool zooms in and out of the Image preview.

•	 Hand: This option moves the image around, just as it does in the 
Elements Image window.
	
•	 Eyedropper: This samples color in the image. (We cover using the 
Elements Eyedropper tools in Book III, Chapter 2, and that informa­
tion also applies to using the Eyedropper in the Camera Raw 
window.)
	
•	 Crop tool: Draw a marquee with the Crop tool and make your color 
and brightness adjustments. The adjustments are applied only to the 
area defined by the Crop tool. When you click Open Image, the photo 
opens, cropped to the area you marked with the Crop tool.
	
•	 Straighten tool: The Straighten tool enables you to draw a horizontal 
axis to straighten a crooked photo.
	
•	 Red Eye Removal: Click the Red Eye Removal tool to remove red-eye 
caused by flash lighting.
	
•	 Open Preferences dialog box (Ctrl+K [Ô+K]): Click this tool to open 
the Camera Raw Preferences dialog box, where you can make some 
choices for saving image settings, change default image settings, and 
use the Adobe Digital Negative (DNG) format.
	
•	 Rotate Left: Used to rotate the image counterclockwise.
	
•	 Rotate Right: The last tool you see below the Title bar is used to 
rotate the image clockwise.
	
	The last two rotation tools are self-explanatory.
	
✓	Preview: Check the box to show dynamic previews of your edits.
	
✓	Shadow/Highlight Clipping: The Shadow and Highlight buttons above 
the histogram (denoted by the up-pointing arrows) show clipping in the 
shadows (dark areas of the image) and highlights (light areas of the 
image). Clipping means that, in a certain area, the image has lost some 
data (and, ultimately, some detail). Think of clipping as something that 
you don’t want to appear in 
your pictures. When you make 
adjustments with these two 
check boxes selected, shadow

highlight clipping is shown in

how the Clipping preview 
appears.

item). When you first open an image, you don’t see any values in the 
RGB area. Click the Zoom tool, the Hand tool, or the Eyedropper tool 
and move the cursor over the Image preview. When you move any of 
these tools around the image, the RGB values corresponding to the 
point below the cursor are reported in this area.
	
✓	Histogram: This graph displays all three channels (red, green, and blue) 
in an image simultaneously. The histogram changes when you change 
other options in the Camera Raw window.
	
	The histogram graphs how pixels in an image are distributed. The distri­
bution includes the number of pixels at each color-intensity level (one of 
the 256 levels you can find out about in Book VIII, Chapter 2).
	
	If images have pixels concentrated in the shadows, you see the histo­
gram skewed to the left. 
Conversely, images with pixels 
concentrated in the highlights 
reveal a histogram skewed to the 
right.
	
	As you grow more familiar with his­
tograms, eventually a quick glance 
at a histogram will suggest adjust­
ments to make to improve an 
image.
	
✓	Detail icons: The three icons 
change the pane below the 
Histogram from Basic (as shown 
in Figure 3-1) to Detail where you 
apply sharpening and noise reduc­
tion (as shown in Figure 3-3) to 
Camera Calibration, where you 
can select a camera profile.
	
✓	Settings (pop-up menu): This pop-
up menu opens when you click the 
small icon on the far right of the 
Basic tab. From this menu, you 
have choices for applying settings 
to the open image. If you change 
any setting, the menu option 
changes to Custom. If you’ve made 
setting choices on a Camera Raw 
image and want to return to the 
shot as it was taken by the camera, 
open the image and select Camera 
Raw Defaults.
Figure 3-3: Clicking the Triangle icon 
below the histogram opens the Detail 
tab, where you can adjust sharpness and 
reduce noise.

Understanding Camera Raw
	
•	 Previous Conversion: This selection is handy if you have a collection 
of images that all require the same settings. After adjusting the first 
image, open additional images and select Previous Conversion. The 
Camera Raw plug-in applies the last settings you made to a Camera 
Raw image to the currently open file.
	
•	 Sharpening images: You can choose to sharpen images in the Camera 
Raw window or in Elements. Try to avoid sharpening here; instead, 
use the sharpening tools in Elements (as we explain in Book VIII, 
Chapter 1).
	
•	 Noise Reduction: Includes options for adjusting the brightness and 
color. You’ve probably seen images with a lot of noise; in extreme 
cases, the pictures look like they were printed on sandpaper. Noise 
in an image is okay if that’s an effect you want to apply intentionally. 
If you want a smooth-looking image, however, you have to eliminate 
any noise introduced by the camera. Luminance Smoothing reduces 
grayscale noise. The next setting is Color Noise Reduction, which is 
used to reduce color noise.
	
✓	White Balance: White Balance settings (available under the Basic tab — 
the far-left icon below the histogram, as shown in Figure 3-1) are used to 
adjust the color balance of an image to reflect the lighting conditions 
under which the shot was originally taken. Remember that the sensor in 
a digital camera is capable of capturing the entire range of white balance 
that the sensor can see. You choose your settings not necessarily on the 
basis of what you see, but rather to match the white balance of the shot 
you took. Therefore, if you set up your camera to take pictures under 
one set of lighting conditions and then move to another set of lighting 
conditions but forget to change the settings, you can let the Camera Raw 
plug-in correct for the difference in white balance; that’s because the 
sensor picked up the entire range, and the necessary data is contained 
in the file.
	
	In Figure 3-4, you can see a picture taken with the camera set for tung­
sten lighting, but the shot was taken outdoors in daylight. By changing 
the White Balance in the Camera Raw dialog box, you can see how differ­
ent settings affect the image color.
	
✓	Temperature: If one of the preset White Balance options doesn’t quite 
do the job, you can move the Basic tab’s Temperature slider or edit the 
text box to settle on values between one White Balance choice and 
another. Use this item to fine-tune the White Balance.
	
✓	Tint: Tint is another fine-tuning adjustment affected by White Balance. 
This slider and text box (again, found on the Basic tab) are used to cor­
rect any green or magenta tints that might appear in a photo.
	
✓	Brightness adjustments: Several adjustment sliders and text boxes in 
the Basic pane help you control the image brightness and tonal range. 
Notice the Exposure setting. This item lets you correct photos taken at 

214
Understanding Camera Raw
the wrong exposure. In analog darkrooms, you might ask technicians to 
push or pull film during processing, which results in (respectively) lon­
ger or shorter processing times. Changing exposure times compensates 
for under- and overexposing film. A nice advantage of using Camera Raw 
is that you can change the exposure for one image and then later open 
the original raw image and change to a different exposure value. Analog 
film can’t be reprocessed, but with Camera Raw, you can reprocess over 
and over again.
	
	Other options for the brightness and tonal controls are similar to the 
choices you have in the Elements Edit Full mode. (For more information 
on these adjustments, see Book VIII, Chapter 2.)
	
✓	Cancel/Reset: When you open the Camera Raw window, the button you 
see by default is Cancel. Press the Alt (Option on a Mac) key, and the 
button changes to Reset. If you want to scrub all the settings you made 
and start over, press the Alt (Option) key and click Reset.

✓	Open Image/Open Copy: This single button has two different purposes:
	
•	 Open Image: This button is the default. Click Open after you choose 
all your settings to process the photo and open it in Elements.
	
•	 Open Copy: Press the Alt (Option) key, and the button changes to 
Open Copy. Click Open Copy to open a copy of the raw image in 
Elements.
	
✓	Done: Clicking Done doesn’t open the image in Edit Full mode. You click 
Done after changing the settings; the new settings then become the new 
defaults for your raw image. You can clear the defaults by opening the 
flyout menu (top-right corner) and selecting Camera Raw Defaults.
	
✓	Zoom: In this drop-down list (located in the bottom-left area of the Raw 
Camera plug-in window), you can choose from several zoom presets. 
You can also edit the text box, click the minus (–) button to zoom out, or 
click the plus (+) button to zoom in. Using any option from the menu 
zooms the Image preview.
	
✓	Help: Clicking the Help button opens a Help document to assist you in 
understanding more about Camera Raw.
	
✓	Save Image: Click the Save Image button to open the Save Options dia­
log box, where you can rename the image to save a copy and make 
choices for saving in Adobe’s DNG format.
	
✓	Depth: If your camera is capable of shooting higher bit depths, they’re 
listed here. If you want to convert to 8-bit images for printing, you can 
select the option from the drop-down list.
All we can hope to provide in this book is a simple cursory view for using 
Camera Raw. Several books have been written exclusively covering the 
Camera Raw format and how to open files in the Camera Raw plug-in window. 
For a more detailed look at using Camera Raw, see Color Management for 
Digital Photographers For Dummies, by Ted Padova and Don Mason (Wiley).
Opening Camera Raw Files
Your first step in converting Camera Raw files is to understand the settings 
you have in the raw converter. Having a general knowledge of what the set­
tings do gets you started, but there’s nothing like having a little practice with 
the settings and viewing your results.
The idea behind using the raw converter is that you want to get the tonal 
range and brightness values set to an optimum before opening the image in 
Elements. You’ll find your editing tasks, such as adjusting color and bright­
ness, much easier in Elements if your image starts somewhere in the ball­
park of a good tonal range.

216
Opening Camera Raw Files
Take Figure 3-5 as an example. This Camera Raw file was opened in the 
Camera Raw dialog box. The image’s white balance is way off the scale, the 
contrast is poor, the saturation is poor, and the photo needs a lot of adjust­
ing to bring it within an acceptable range of color and contrast.
Figure 3-5: A poor-quality photo opened in the raw converter.
The first step to perform is to adjust the white balance. We moved the 
Temperature slider to the far left to bring the white balance into a proper 
setting. We then made some adjustments for the Exposure, Brightness, 
Contrast, Clarity, and Saturation, as shown in Figure 3-6.
Your clue for making proper adjustments is the histogram. While you move 
the sliders, you want to try to get an even tonal range across the histogram 
without clipping the image (showing spikes on either end). Compare the 
histogram in Figure 3-5 to the one shown in Figure 3-6.
More important than the color balance itself is the data you find in the histo­
gram about the tonal range. You can make adjustments for brightness and 
color after you open the image in Elements.
After we made our adjustments in the raw converter, we clicked Open 
and the photo opened in the Image window in Edit Full mode, as shown in 
Figure 3-7. From here, all we need are a few adjustments using the Shadow/
Highlight dialog box, the Levels, and the Hue/Saturation dialog box. (See 
Book VIII, Chapter 2 for using these image-enhancement settings.)

Saving Your Edits
Opening any photo in Camera Raw
You can use the raw converter to work with any photo on your computer 
saved as JPEG, TIFF, or other formats that weren’t originally saved as 
Camera Raw. 
In Edit Full mode (Windows), choose Open As and choose Camera Raw from 
the Open As drop-down list. The file opens in the raw converter, where you 
can make adjustments before opening in Edit Full mode. You might use this 
method to open files that need temperature adjustments before attempting 
to edit the photos in Edit Full mode.
Opening photos in Camera Raw from Adobe Bridge
On the Mac, you won’t find an Open As command in Edit Full mode. 
However, you can open files in the raw converter from within Adobe Bridge. 
In Adobe Bridge, choose File➪Open in Camera Raw. The same raw converter 
opens the image where you can make tonal adjustments before opening the 
file in Edit Full mode.
Saving Your Edits
After opening an image in Edit Full mode, choose File➪Save As and save the 
file under a new filename. This way you preserve the original raw image, and 
you can return to the raw converter, make other adjustments, and open the 
file in Elements again to tweak the 
brightness and color. For the file for­
mat, choose either Photoshop (PSD) or 
TIFF (*.TIF) to prevent the sort of data 
loss that occurs when you save an 
image in JPEG format.
When you open a file in the raw con­
verter and you want to return to the 
default image that your camera took, 
open the flyout menu on the far right of 
the Basic tab and choose Reset Camera 
Raw Defaults, as shown in Figure 3-8. 
The photo returns to the image that 
was originally taken with your camera.
Figure 3-8: Open the Basic flyout menu 
and choose Reset Camera Raw Defaults to 
return to the original, unedited image.

T
o produce great output, you have to understand color and how 
Elements treats color. If you want to carry around a laptop computer to 
show off your photos, you can basically adjust color for this particular com­
puter. However, sharing photos with other users, printing your pictures, 
and hosting photos on Web sites require that you know something about 
the way color is displayed on other devices and in photo prints.
There’s a lot to know about managing color, including setting up color 
workspaces, managing color, and working with color profiles. In 
this chapter, we talk about these issues — and offer some 
key concepts for understanding color as it pertains to 
Photoshop Elements.
Dealing with Foreground 
and Background Colors
Foreground and background colors appear in the 
Tools panel as large color swatches. What you see in 
the two-color swatches represents the currently 
selected color for a foreground and the currently 
selected color for the background.
	
	 By default, the foreground color is black, and the background 
color is white. By making color selections from the Color Picker (see 
the upcoming section “Poking around the Color Picker”), from the Swatches 
panel (see “Grabbing color from the Swatches panel” later in this chapter), 
or by clicking the Eyedropper tool and lifting a color from an image, you can 
change the foreground and/or background colors.

220
Defining Color
You can use colors appearing in the Foreground Color Swatch to fill type 
selections, shapes, and strokes, as well as when using tools to apply color. 
You can also use the current background color when using the Eraser tool to 
change background color.
A couple keyboard shortcuts are helpful when working with the foreground 
and background color swatches. Frequently used keyboard shortcuts that 
you want to commit to memory include
	
✓	D: Press the D key on your keyboard and you return to default black for 
the foreground color and default white for the background color.
	
✓	X: Press the X key on your keyboard and the foreground and back­
ground colors are reversed. You might want to use this keyboard short­
cut when painting black and white areas with one of the marking tools.
	
You can also click the two arrows adjacent to the top right of the 
Foreground Color Swatch to reverse colors, or click the tiny icon adjacent to 
the lower right of the Foreground Color Swatch to return to default colors.
Defining Color
When you want to use a color for the foreground or background other than 
the default black and white colors, you make your color assignments using 
tools, panels, or dialog boxes.
All the colors available for a given color mode are accessible from the 
Swatches panel and the Photoshop Elements Color Picker. The range of col­
ors shown in an image is also accessible through sampling color with the 
Eyedropper tool.
Poking around the Color Picker
The Color Picker provides you with a color spectrum displaying all the col­
ors available within a given color mode. If you’re in RGB mode, you can 
choose from a color panel of more than 16.7 million colors.
To open the Color Picker, click the Foreground Color Swatch in the Tools 
panel. The Color Picker pops up in a dialog box as shown in Figure 4-1. The 
choices you have for selecting color and the options available to you in this 
dialog box include
	
✓	Color panel: The large color swatch displays colors according to the 
position of the color spectrum slider.
	
✓	New Color Choice: Clicking the color swatch selects a new color for the 
foreground color.

✓	Warning: Not Web Safe Color: Not all colors display equally on both the 
Mac and Windows operating systems in 8-bit mode when you are view­
ing Web pages. If a color is out of the Web Safe color palette, a warning 
icon appears.
	
	The Web Safe palette was introduced more than 15 years ago to create a 
color palette that used common colors between computer systems with 
8-bit video cards. It’s almost nonessential today since almost all com­
puter systems use 24-bit color.

Choice Swatch show you a before/after difference between the previous 
color and the new color.

spectrum slider, these values and the HSB values change to reflect new 
color choices.
	
✓	Only Web Colors: Check this box if you want to view only Web Safe colors.
	
✓	Color Spectrum slider: Move the slider up or down to change the hue 
and display a new hue range in the large color swatch.
	
✓	Web Safe Hexadecimal Values: Web Safe colors are defined using spe­
cific hexadecimal values. The hex value is displayed here for the current 
new color.
To define a new foreground color, do the following:
	
1.	 Click the Foreground Color Swatch in the Tools panel.
	
	 The Color Picker opens.
	
2.	 Move the color spectrum slider to the hue range you want to use for 
the new color.
	
	 For example, if you want to select a blue color, move the slider up to the 
range of blues.
	
3.	 Click the cursor in the large Color Swatch to select a color.
	
	 The new selected color appears as a circle in the New Color area above 
the current foreground color, as shown in Figure 4-2.

	 The new foreground color selected in the Color Picker appears in the 
Foreground Color Swatch.
	
If you want to change the background color, click the Background Color 
Swatch in the Tools panel, and the same Color Picker opens as shown in 
Figure 4-1. Any changes you make in the Color Picker are applied to the 
background color.
Grabbing color from the Swatches panel
Selecting color in the Color Picker is fine when you want to make a single color 
selection and use it once. However, if you want to create your own custom 
color panel and reuse colors, you want an easier method for choosing fore­
ground and background colors — and a way to reuse the same colors easily.
The Color Swatches panel provides you with exactly what you need to cre­
ate a personal color panel and easily access colors when painting on a can­
vas or filling selections on an image.
To open the Color Swatches panel, choose Window➪Color Swatches. The 
Color Swatches panel (as shown in Figure 4-3) opens as a floating panel.
When you open the Color Swatches 
panel, you see a default panel of colors. 
Elements provides you with a number 
of different color panels that you can 
load into the Color Swatches panel. 
This enables you to create your own 
custom color panel. 
Using preset color panels
Open the Default drop-down list in the 
Color Swatches panel, and you find 
several preset color panels that you 
can load in the Color Swatches panel, 
as shown in Figure 4-4. Your choices 
include
	
✓	Mac OS: If you’re using a Mac and looking at an image created on a 
Windows machine, choose this panel to load a color panel that displays 
color accurately on the Mac.
	
✓	Photo Filter Colors: This swatch set is a narrow range of colors consis­
tent with those you apply using Photo Filters. (For a look at how Photo 
Filters are used, see Book VII, Chapter 1.)

Web Safe colors.
	
✓	Windows: This color set contains 
all the colors that display properly 
on a Windows machine.
Creating a custom swatch set
The Color Picker has all the colors 
you can use in a given color mode. 
You may want to add more colors to 
one of the color swatch sets when you 
select different colors in the Color Picker. You might also want to delete 
some colors from a swatch set, or you may want to save your new swatch 
set as a library that you can load in Elements so you can use the new cus­
tom colors.
All this is possible in Elements, and here’s how you go about creating your 
own custom panel of color swatches:
	
1.	 Open the Color Swatches panel.
	
	 Choose Window➪Color Swatches to open the panel.
	
2.	 Delete colors from the Default panel.
	
	 Choose a color you don’t want to appear in your custom color panel. 
Press the Alt (Option) key and the cursor changes to a Scissors icon. 
Click a color swatch with the Alt (Option) key depressed to delete the 
color. Continue deleting all the colors you don’t want in your custom 
color set.
	
3.	 Select a new color to add to your custom color set.
	
	 Click the Foreground Color Swatch in the Tools panel. When the Color 
Picker opens, click a color you want to add to your new set. Click OK, 
and the new color appears as the foreground color.

4.	 Add the foreground color to the set.
	
	 Click the panel menu icon in the Color Swatches panel to open a flyout 
menu. From the menu choices, choose New Swatch. The Color Swatch 
Name dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-5. The color is derived 
from the current foreground color to the left of the Name text box. Type 
a name for the color swatch and click OK. The new swatch is added to 
the Color Swatches panel.

5.	 Add additional colors.
	
	 Continue using Steps 3 and 4 to add new colors to the Swatches panel.
	
6.	 Save the swatches.
	
	 Open the panel menu and choose Save Swatches. A Save dialog box 
opens with the Color Swatches folder selected as the target folder. Be 
sure not to change the folder location. Type a name for your new 
swatches and click OK.
You have saved a set of swatches without disturbing the original Default set. 
You can always return to the Default set by selecting another preset from 
the drop-down list and then going back to the menu and choosing Default. 
The original set remains intact.
Loading swatches
If you created a custom set of color swatches and then chose one of the pre­
sets from the Default drop-down list, the custom colors you created are not 
visible in the Color Swatches panel. To see them there and use them, you 
have to load the swatches back into the Color Swatches panel.
To load swatches, open the panel menu and choose Load Swatches. A Load 
dialog box appears with the target folder pointing to the Elements Color 
Swatches folder. Here you find all the custom color swatches you saved from 
the Color Swatches panel. Select a file in the Load dialog box and click Open. 
The custom color swatches set opens in the Color Swatches panel.

226
Defining Color
Replacing swatches
If you want to replace colors in an existing Color Swatches panel, you can do 
so by selecting another menu command in the panel menu. Choose Replace 
Swatches in this menu, and the Load dialog box opens. Select a file in the 
Custom Colors folder, and the colors in the file you selected replace the 
existing swatches.
Lifting and sampling color
If you have a photo that has colors you want to add to your Color Swatches, 
you can sample colors in an open image.
	
	 Click the Eyedropper tool and click anywhere on a photo in the Image win­
dow, and the Eyedropper samples the color. We call this technique lifting 
color, although the color is not removed from the photo (it merely replaces 
the current foreground color). If you want to replace the background color, 
press the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and click the Eyedropper tool on a 
color you want to sample.
In the Options bar, you find a few settings for the Eyedropper tool. Click the 
Eyedropper tool in the Tools panel and click the down-pointing arrow adja­
cent to Point Sample, and the drop-down list displays three menu choices, as 
shown in Figure 4-6. The menu items include
	
✓	Point Sample: This selection is the default. 
When you click the Eyedropper tool to sample 
color, the pixel you click is the sampled color.
	
✓	3 by 3 Average: This menu choice averages 3 
pixels by 3 pixels, and the sampled color is the 
result of combining the color at the sample 
point with 8 surrounding colors.
	
✓	5 by 5 Average: This menu choice averages 5 
pixels by 5 pixels, and the sampled color is the 
result of combining the color at the sample point with 24 surrounding 
colors.
Just as you add colors from the Foreground Color Swatch to a Color 
Swatches library, you can sample colors in a photo and use the sampled 
colors to create a custom Color Swatch library.

dropper tool and open the

Managing Color
Understanding Color Management Essentials
Understanding Color Management Essentials
In Elements, when it comes to color, the challenge isn’t understanding color 
theory or definitions, but rather matching the RGB color you see on your 
computer monitor as closely as possible to your output. That output can be 
a printout from a color printer, a screen view on a Web page, or an image in 
a photo-slide presentation.
We say match “as closely as possible” because you can’t expect to achieve 
an exact match; you have far too many printer and monitor variables to deal 
with. However, if you properly manage color, you can get a very close 
match.
To match color in your monitor and your output, you must calibrate your 
monitor and then choose a color workspace profile. In the following sec­
tions, you can find all the details on how to do just that.
Introducing color channels
Your first level of color mastery in Photoshop is to understand what RGB is 
and how it comes about. RGB stands for red, green, and blue. These are the 
primary colors in the computer world. Forget about what you know about 
primary colors in an analog world; computers see primary colors as RGB.
RGB color is divided into color channels. Although you can’t see the individ­
ual channels in Elements, you still need to get a handle on color channels. 
Read on.
When you see a color pixel (a tiny, square dot), the color is represented as 
different levels of gray in each channel. (This may sound confusing at first, 
but stay with us for just a minute.) When you have a color channel, such as 
the red channel, and you let all light pass through the channel, you end up 
with a bright red. If you screen that light a little with a gray filter, you let 
less light pass through, thereby diluting the red color. That’s how channels 
work — individually, they all use different levels of gray that permit up to 
256 different levels of light to pass through them. When you change the 
intensity of light in the different channels, you ultimately change the color.
Each channel can have up to 256 levels of gray that mask out light. You can 
calculate the total number of possible colors you can create in an RGB 
model by multiplying the values for each channel (256 × 256 × 256). The 
result is more than 16.7 million; that’s the total number of colors a computer 
monitor can display in RGB color.

228
Understanding Color Management Essentials
This is all well and good 
as far as theory goes, but 
what does that mean in 
practical terms? Actually, 
you see some of this 
information in tools and 
dialog boxes you work 
with in Elements. As an 
experiment, open a file 
in Elements and choose 
Enhance➪Adjust 
Lighting➪Levels; the 
dialog box shown in 
Figure 4-7 opens.
Notice that the Channel 
drop-down list shows 
you Red, Green, and Blue 
as individual channels, as 
well as a composite RGB 
selection. Furthermore, 
the Output Levels area 
shows you values ranging 
from 0 on the left to 255 on the right. Considering that 0 is a number, you 
have a total of 256 different levels of gray.
	
What’s important is that you know that your work in color is related to 
RGB images that make up three different channels. Each channel can let 
256 different levels of gray through — that is, hold back different amounts 
of light — to change brightness values and color.
Understanding bit depth
Another important item to understand about channels is bit depth. A bit holds 
one of two values; one value is for black, the other for white. When you have 
256 levels of gray, you’re working with an 8-bit-per-channel image — 8 bits 
with 2 possible values each is 28, or 256, possible levels of gray. Multiply 8 bits 
per channel times your 3 channels and you get 24 bits, which is the common 
bit depth of images you print on your desktop printer.
Now take a look at the Image➪Mode menu. You should see a menu selection 
that says 8 Bits/Channel, as shown in Figure 4-8. When you open an image in 
Elements, if this menu command is grayed out, it means you’re working with 
a 24-bit image — that is, an image of 8 bits per channel.

open the Levels dialog box.

What does it mean when 
you can select the 8 Bits/
Channel menu com­
mand? You can be cer­
tain that your image isn’t 
an 8-bit-per-channel 
image. You may be able 
to select this command 
because some digital 
cameras and most low-
end, consumer-grade 
scanners can capture 
images at higher bit 
depths. Using a scanner, 
you can scan a photo at 
16 bits per channel. 
When you do, you end up 
with many more levels of 
gray. When you take a 
picture with a quality 
digital camera, you can capture 32-bit-per-channel images, and you end up 
with a file containing more than 4 billion levels of gray. That’s a lot!
Now, here’s the catch: All files have to be reduced to 8 bits per channel 
before you print them — because that’s all the information any printer uses. 
In addition, many tools, commands, and panel options work only with 8-bit-
per-channel images. So, you ask, “What’s the benefit of acquiring images at 
higher bit depths than I can print?”
	
If you attempt to adjust brightness, contrast, or other image enhancements 
in an 8-bit-per-channel image, you often destroy some data. You can cause 
some noticeable image degradation if you move adjustment sliders too far 
while working with 8-bit-per-channel images. When you edit your 16-bit and 
32-bit images, you don’t destroy data — you simply inform Elements which 
256 levels of gray (of the total number available) you want to use. The result 
is an image with more continuous gray tones than you can achieve in 8-bit-
per-channel images.
Calibrating your monitor
Your monitor needs to be calibrated to adjust the gamma and brightness, 
correct any color tints or colorcasts, and generally get your monitor to dis­
play, as precisely as possible, accurate colors on your output. You have a 
few choices for which tool you can use to adjust monitor brightness, ranging 
Figure 4-8: When you can choose 8 Bits/Channel, your 
image bit depth is higher than 8 bits per channel.

Understanding Color Management Essentials
from a low-cost hardware device that sells for less than $100 to expensive 
calibration equipment of $3,000 or more — or you can skip the hardware 
and use tools provided by Adobe, by Windows, or by your Mac.
	
Gamma is the brightness of midlevel tones in an image. In technical terms, 
it’s a parameter that describes the shape of the transfer function for one or 
more stages in an imaging pipeline.
We skip the high-end costly devices and software utilities that don’t do you 
any good and suggest that you make, at the very least, one valuable pur­
chase for creating a monitor profile: a hardware profiling system. On the low 
end of the price scale, some affordable versions of this device go a long way 
toward helping you adjust your monitor brightness and color balance. Here 
are some examples:
	
✓	ColorVision Spyder2express: For as low as $64, you can purchase an 
easy-to-use, three-step calibration device to balance the color on your 
monitor and adjust it for optimum brightness. This device is receiving 
five-star ratings at online resellers, including www.amazon.com.
	
✓	Pantone Huey Monitor Color Correction: This is another, low-cost sys­
tem used for calibrating both CRTs and LCDs. This unit retails for $89 
and sells for $63 at Amazon.com, as of this writing.
	
✓	X-Rite Eye-One Display 2 (formerly GreTag MacBeth Eye-One Display 
2): This device, like the Spyder2express and Huey, is an easy-to-use pro­
filing tool that works with CRT displays, LCDs, and laptop computers. It 
sells for around $195 to $250. You attach the suction cup to your moni­
tor and click a few buttons in the software application accompanying 
the hardware, and Eye-One Display 2 eventually prompts you to save a 
monitor profile. The profile you create is used automatically by your 
operating system when you start your computer. When the profile kicks 
in, your monitor is balanced with the settings that were determined 
when the device performed the calibration.
On LCD monitors, you adjust some of the hardware controls to bring your 
monitor into a match for overall brightness with your photo prints. Make 
sure you run many test prints and match your prints against your monitor 
view to make the two as similar as possible.
You have a lot to focus on to calibrate monitors and get color right on your 
monitor and your output. (We talk more about color output in Book IX, 
Chapter 3.) For a good resource for color correction and printing using 
Photoshop Elements, we recommend that you look at Color Management for 
Digital Photographers For Dummies, by Ted Padova and Don Mason (Wiley).

Using and 
Managing Color
Establishing Your Color Settings
Establishing Your Color Settings
After you get your monitor color adjusted by using a hardware profiling sys­
tem, your next step is to choose your color workspace. In Elements, you 
have a choice between one of two workspace colors: either sRGB or Adobe 
RGB (1998). You access your color workspace settings by choosing Edit➪
Color Settings. The Color Settings dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-9.
Figure 4-9: The Color Settings dialog box.
The options you have in the Color Settings dialog box include
	
✓	No Color Management: This choice turns off all color management. 
Don’t choose this option for any work you do in Elements. You use No 
Color Management when you work with files that have color profiles 
embedded in the photos. Most likely you won’t be using these types of 
photos. (For more about when you might use this option, see Book IX, 
Chapter 2.)
	
✓	Always Optimize Colors for Computer Screens: Checking this radio but­
ton sets your workspace to sRGB. sRGB color is used quite often for 
viewing images on your monitor. But this workspace often results in the 
best choice for color printing, as well. Many color printers can output all 
the colors you can see in the sRGB workspace. In addition, many photo 
services, such as the Kodak EasyShare services (discussed in Book IX, 
Chapter 2), prefer this workspace setting.

232
Understanding How Profiles Work
	
✓	Always Optimize for Printing: Checking this option sets your color 
workspace to Adobe RGB (1998). This workspace has more available col­
ors than can be seen on your monitor. If you choose this workspace, you 
need to be certain that your printer is capable of using all the colors in 
this color space.
	
✓	Allow Me to Choose: When you choose this option, Elements prompts 
you for a profile assignment when you open images that contain no pro­
file. This setting is handy if you switch back and forth between screen 
and print images.
Understanding How Profiles Work
You probably created a monitor color profile when you calibrated your mon­
itor. You probably also selected a color profile when you opened the Color 
Settings dialog box and selected your workspace color. When you start your 
computer, your monitor color profile kicks in and adjusts your overall moni­
tor brightness and correction for any colorcasts. When you open a photo in 
Elements, color is automatically converted from your monitor color space to 
your workspace color.
At print time, you use another color profile to output your photos to your 
desktop color printer. Color is then converted from your workspace color to 
your printer’s color space. In Book IX, Chapter 2, we show you how to use 
color profiles for printing. For now, just realize that the proper use of color 
profiles determines whether you can get good color output. From here, you 
can jump to Book IX, Chapter 2 and understand how the color profiles are 
used at print time.

Chapter 5: Time Travel — 
Undoing in Elements
In This Chapter
✓	Understanding undoing in Elements
✓	Returning to unedited files
✓	Using the Undo History panel
B
ack in 1984, Apple Computer brought windowing interfaces to the 
masses with the introduction of the Macintosh computer. Also tucked 
into that interface was the Undo command. Both innovations revolutionized 
the way people use personal computers. Together with the Cut, Copy, and 
Paste commands, these features became a standard in all programs that 
followed.
Being able to Undo your most recent edit in a program like Elements gives 
you the freedom to experiment, as well as the chance to correct mistakes 
immediately. Adobe broadened that initial Undo feature in Photoshop 
Elements so you can retrace an entire series of editing steps with multiple 
undos, see a visual list of edits in the Undo History panel, and 
work with different editing states.
In this chapter, we explore the many options you have 
for branching out, experimenting a little, and retracing 
your editing steps (or overcoming a series of editing 
mistakes) without having to save multiple versions 
of your photos.
Undoing What’s Done with 
the Undo Command
As you might expect, the Undo command is found in the 
Edit menu. To undo an editing step, you simply choose 
Edit➪Undo or press the Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on a Mac) keys on your 
keyboard. This simple command helps you correct a mistake or toss 
away an experimental edit that doesn’t work for you.
When you open the Edit menu, you find the Undo command at the top of the 
menu. In addition, you find the name of the edit you last applied to the 

234
Undoing What’s Done with the Undo Command
image. In Figure 5-1, you can see 
that we just applied a fill within a 
selection. When we opened the Edit 
menu, the menu command appears 
as Undo Fill.
Adjusting the number 
of available undos
If you make several edits in 
Elements, you can take advantage of 
the Undo command several times. 
The number of undos you have 
available is determined in the Edit 
Full Preferences dialog box. To 
adjust the number of undos you 
want available, choose Edit➪
Preferences (Windows) or Adobe 
Photoshop Elements 8.0➪
Preferences (Mac) and the 
Preferences dialog box opens as 
shown in Figure 5-2. Alternatively, 
you can press Ctrl+K (Ô+K) to open 
the Preferences dialog box.
Figure 5-2: The Preferences dialog box.
In the Preferences dialog box, you click the Performance item in the list on 
the left to open the Performance preferences panel. Below the History & 
Cache item on the right, you find History States, as shown in Figure 5-3. The 
setting you make here — by adjusting the slider or by typing a number in the 
Figure 5-1: The Undo command appears listed 
in the Edit menu with the name of the last edit 
applied to the document.

235
Book III
Chapter 5
Time Travel — 
Undoing in 
Elements
Reverting to What’s Saved
History States text box — determines the number of undos you have avail­
able when you choose Edit➪Undo or press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z). By default, the 
number is set to 50, meaning you can step back to undo edits up to 50 times.
Figure 5-3: The History States number determines the total undos you 
have when editing a file.
	
The adjustment for History States also relates to the Undo History panel we 
talk about later in this chapter in the section, “Working with the Almighty 
Undo History Panel.”
Redoing edits
You also have a command for Redo in the Edit menu. If you choose Undo 
from the Edit menu or press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z) and then change your mind, you 
can always just redo that last undo: Choose Redo or press Ctrl+Y (Ô+Y), and 
the last undo returns to the state before you chose to undo the edit. The 
number of redos you have is the same as the number of undos. For example, 
if you set the History States to ten in the Performance preferences and make 
ten edits, and then successively press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z) ten times, you can suc­
cessively press Ctrl+Y (Ô+Y) to redo all ten undos.
Reverting to What’s Saved
At times, rather than undo a bunch of edits, you just want to toss all the 
edits away and return to the last saved version of your file. The Revert com­
mand in the Edit menu returns you to the last saved version of your photo.
If you make several edits and you like what you see, you can choose File➪Save 
or press Ctrl+S (Ô+S) to save your edits. If you then make several more edits 
and you don’t like the results, choose Edit➪Revert to revert to the last save.

236
Working with the Almighty Undo History Panel
	
In many Adobe programs, you find a Revert command listed under the File 
menu. In Photoshop Elements, however, the Revert command is listed under 
the Edit menu. Keep this in mind when you perform edits in Edit Full mode.
Working with the Almighty Undo History Panel
Using menu commands and keyboard shortcuts enables you to travel back 
and forward in time to undo and redo edits. When executing these actions, 
you don’t have a visual clue to tell you which edit will be undone or redone. 
Instead, you have to choose a menu command or keyboard shortcut and 
then view the result in the Image 
window.
The Undo History panel, on the 
other hand, displays a visual of your 
editing history where you can travel 
back and forward in time to change 
your edits with a complete list of 
the edits made on a photo shown in 
the panel.
To open the Undo History panel, 
choose Window➪Undo History. 
The Undo History panel opens as a 
floating panel. As you make edits 
on an image, each edit is shown in 
a list in the panel as you can see in 
Figure 5-4.
Viewing an image’s various states
The Undo History panel gives you a capability that menu commands don’t: 
You can target an Undo (or Redo) to go back (or forward) to a specific edit. 
For example, if you create a selection, apply an enhancement edit (such as 
changing image brightness), and then apply a filter, you can return to the 
selection with one mouse click. Instead of choosing Undo to undo the filter 
and Undo again to undo the image brightness, you simply click the selection 
edit in the Undo History panel.
The number of history states is determined in the Performance preferences 
shown earlier in Figure 5-3. By default, you have 50 history states that 
appear in the Undo History panel. When you come to the 51st edit, the first 
edit in the sequence is deleted from the panel and you can’t return to that 
state. As you make more new edits, you continually delete edits from the top 
of the panel.
Figure 5-4: The Undo History panel.

Elements
Working with the Almighty Undo History Panel
If you want to add more states to the Undo History panel, open the Performance 
preferences and change the value in the History States text box.
	
As you increase history states in the Performance preferences, the amount 
of memory required by Elements is increased. You may find the program get­
ting sluggish if you double the History States or add more than twice the 
default value.
Navigating through the history states
To return to an earlier edit in the Undo History panel, find the item you want 
to return to in the list and click it. You can also apply a number of edits to 
create a selection and, after the 
selection is created, apply another 
series of edits to the selected area. 
If you want to return to the selec­
tion edit, click the item in the 
Undo History panel, as shown in 
Figure 5-5.
As long as the items remain in the 
list, you can click backward or for­
ward to undo and redo edits.
Deleting and clearing 
states
You may have applied a series of 
edits to a document and then want 
to return to an earlier edit. 
Suppose you decide that all the 
edits made after the one you want 
to return to are no longer needed. (This might happen if you’re experiment­
ing with different edits and viewing the results.) If you know that the edits 
following a particular edit are no longer needed, you can delete them from 
the list.
To delete the last edit in the Undo History panel, click it in the list and then 
right-click to open a context menu. From the menu choices, select Delete. 
The selected edit is deleted from the list.
If you have a series of items you want to delete from the list, click the first 
item within a given list of edits to open a context menu. Then, when you 
choose Delete, all items in the list that follow the selected item are deleted.
Figure 5-5: Click the item in the list that you 
want to return to so you can undo a series of 
edits.

238
Working with the Almighty Undo History Panel
	
Keep in mind that all edits following an edit you target for deletion are 
deleted when you open a context menu and choose Delete. If you want to 
delete a series of edits that are followed by edits you want to retain, it’s a bit 
more complex: You have to delete the unwanted edits individually. Elements 
doesn’t give you the capability to select a group of edits and then delete the 
whole group at once.
If you apply a number of edits and choose File➪Save, the edits you made up 
to the time you save the file are kept and recorded as part of the new saved 
file. The Undo History panel maintains the list of edits applied to the docu­
ment before you last saved it. Therefore, you can undo edits after saving a 
file as long as the file remains open. If you close the file and reopen it, the 
Undo History panel is cleared. You can also clear the Undo History panel 
after making edits by opening a context menu and choosing Clear History. 
The list is cleared and appears the same as when you first opened the file 
before you applied any edits.

Book IV
Selections

A
fter you get beyond understanding color and 
file attributes, one of the most important 
editing tasks you can master is creating selec­
tions. As a matter of fact, we make the claim that 
when you do, you master Photoshop Elements.
This book takes you through all the various tools 
and methods for making selections. Be sure to get 
a handle on the concepts contained in this book 
before you tackle some of those major editing 
jobs.

Chapter 1: Making Selections
In This Chapter
✓	Defining selections
✓	Creating selections with the Marquee tools
✓	Roping your selections with the Lasso tools
✓	Selecting pixels with the Magic Wand tool
✓	Using the Quick Selection tool to save time
✓	Painting with the Selection Brush
✓	Cropping and transforming with the Recompose tool
S
ometimes you get lucky, and what you capture in the camera’s view­
finder is exactly what you want to edit, print, or share online. But at 
other times, you may want to work with just a portion of that image. Maybe 
you just need to adjust the contrast in a certain area. Or you want to com­
bine part of one image with another. In these instances, you have to make a 
selection before you can go on to do the real editing work.
Being able to make accurate selections is a valuable skill. 
Fortunately, Elements offers an assortment of tools and tech­
niques for making selections. In this chapter, we give you 
the foundation to use the basic selection tools. If, after 
you make a selection, you want to modify or transform 
that selection, check out Chapter 2 of this minibook. 
Finally, masking is yet another way to make a selec­
tion. Be sure to look at Book VI, Chapter 4, for the 
lowdown on masking.
Defining Selections
Defining a selection means that you specify which part 
of the image you want to work with. Everything within a 
selection is considered selected. Everything outside the 
selection is unselected. Seems simple enough. It is, except that 
you can also have partially selected pixels, which allow for soft-
edged, diffused selections. You can create partially selected pixels by feath­
ering, masking, or anti-aliasing the selection. We cover feathering and 
anti-aliasing in this chapter. Masking is covered in Book VI, Chapter 4.

242
Selecting a Rectangular or Elliptical Area
When you make a selection, a moving dotted outline called a selection border 
(also called a selection outline or selection marquee) appears around the 
selected area. After you’ve made a selection, any adjustments or edits you 
apply affect only that portion. The unselected areas remain unchanged. You 
can also make a selection in one image and then copy and paste it into 
another image. If you can’t squeeze in that trip to Europe this year, no wor­
ries. Select yourself from a family photo, choose Edit➪Copy, open a stock 
photo of the Eiffel Tower, and then choose Edit➪Paste. Nobody will know 
that you never made it to the City of Lights.
	
When making selections, be sure that you’re working in the Editor, in Edit 
Full mode, and not in Edit Quick or Guided modes, or in the Organizer (or 
Bridge on the Mac). For more on various modes in Elements, see Book I, 
Chapter 1.
Selecting a Rectangular or Elliptical Area
The Marquee tools are the easiest selection tools to use. Basically, if you can 
use a mouse without much difficulty, you can become a marqueeing expert.
The Rectangular Marquee tool creates rectangular or square selections. Use 
this tool when you want to grab just a portion of an image and copy and 
paste it into a new, blank document or into another image.
Follow these steps to make a selection with the Rectangular Marquee tool:
	
1.	 Select the Rectangular Marquee tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 The tool looks like a dotted square. You can also use the keyboard 
shortcut — press the M key.
	
2.	 Click and drag from one corner of the area that you want to select to 
the opposite corner.
	
	 While you drag, the selection border appears. The border follows the 
movement of your mouse cursor (a crosshair or plus sign icon).
	
3.	 Release your mouse button.
	
	 You now have a rectangular selection, as shown in Figure 1-1.
The Elliptical Marquee tool, which shares the same flyout menu as the 
Rectangular Marquee tool, creates elliptical or circular selections. You can 
select clocks, doughnuts, inner tubes, and other round objects with this tool.

Here are the steps to create an elliptical selection:
	
1.	 Select the Elliptical Marquee tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 You can also use the keyboard shortcut. If the Elliptical Marquee tool 
is visible, press the M key. If the Rectangular Marquee is visible, press 
Shift+M.
	
2.	 Position the crosshair near the area that you want to select, click the 
area, and then click and drag around the element.
	
	 While you drag, the selection marquee appears.
	
3.	 When you’re satisfied with your selection, release the mouse button.
	
	 Your elliptical selection is complete, as shown in Figure 1-2.

244
Selecting a Rectangular or Elliptical Area
	
If your selection isn’t quite centered around your element, move the selec­
tion border by clicking and dragging inside the border with either the 
Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tool. You can also actually move a selec­
tion with either tool while you’re drawing by pressing the spacebar.

Fine-tuning squares and circles
If you want to create a perfect square or circle, hold down the Shift key after 
you begin dragging your mouse. When you have your desired selection, 
release the mouse button first and then release the Shift key.
You may find it easier to create an elliptical selection by dragging from the 
center outward. To do so, click and hold down the mouse button in the cen­
ter of your desired element. Then press the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) 
and drag from the center outward. After you have your desired selection, 
release the mouse button first and then the key.
If you want to draw from the center out and want a perfect circle (or square), 
hold down the Shift key as well. When you have your desired selection, 
release your mouse button first and then Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac).

You can also achieve a perfect circle or square by specifying a 1:1 aspect 
ratio in the Options bar.
Using the Marquee options
The Options bar provides oodles of other options when you’re making 
Marquee selections. Some of these options allow you to make precise selec­
tions by specifying exact measurements. Others enable you to make soft-
edged, feathered selections.
	
You must select the options on the Options bar, as shown in Figure 1-3, 
before you make your selection with the Marquee tools. The only exception 
is that you can feather a selection after you have created it.

Anti-alias
Feather
Figure 1-3: Specify Marquee settings in the Options bar.
Here’s the scoop on each of the Marquee options:
	
✓	Feather: Feathering softens, or feathers, the edges of a selection. The 
amount of softening depends on the value — the higher the value, the 
softer the edge, as shown in Figure 1-4. The radius measures how far in 
all directions the feather effect extends. Small amounts of feathering can 
be used to create natural transitions between selected elements in a col­
lage. Larger amounts are used to create a special effect where one image 
gradually fades into another. If you just want a selected element to have 
a soft edge without the background, choose Select➪Inverse and then 
delete the background. 
	
	To feather while you’re selecting, select the Feather option on the 
Options bar before you use the Marquee tools. You can feather a selec­
tion after the fact by choosing Select➪Feather.
	
✓	Anti-alias: Whereas feathering completely softens edges, anti-aliasing 
just slightly softens the edge of an elliptical or irregularly shaped selec­
tion so that very hard, jagged edges aren’t quite so prominent, as shown 
in Figure 1-5. An anti-aliased edge is always only 1 pixel wide.
	
	We recommend keeping the Anti-alias option selected, especially if 
you plan on creating collaged images. Anti-aliasing helps create natural-
looking transitions and blends between multiple selections. However, if 
you want a super-crisp edge, uncheck this option.

✓	Mode: The Mode drop-down list contains three settings:
	
•	 Normal: This option enables you to freely drag a selection to any 
dimension.
	
•	 Fixed Aspect Ratio: This setting allows you to specify a fixed ratio of 
width to height in a selection. For example, if you enter 2 for width 

247
Book IV 
Chapter 1
Making Selections
Freeform Selecting with the Lasso Tools
and 1 for height, you always get a Marquee selection that’s twice as 
wide as it is high, no matter what the size.
	
•	 Fixed Size: This setting lets you specify values for the Width and 
Height. This option comes in handy when you need to make multiple 
selections that must be the same exact size, such as in a school year­
book. Note that the marquee is immediately drawn when you click 
your canvas. The click point is the top-left corner of the marquee.
	
✓	Width and Height: When you select Fixed Aspect Ratio or Fixed Size 
from the drop-down list, you also enter values in the Width and Height 
text boxes. To swap the Width and Height values, click the double-
headed arrow button.
	
	Even though the default unit of measurement in the Width and Height 
text boxes is pixels (px), you can enter any unit of measurement that 
Element recognizes — pixels, inches (in), centimeters (cm), millimeters 
(mm), points (pt), picas (pica), or percents (%). Enter the value and then 
type the word or abbreviation of your desired unit of measurement.
Freeform Selecting with the Lasso Tools
Unfortunately, not much in life is perfectly rectangular or elliptical in shape. 
Most of the time, you have to deal with irregular shapes that have undulations 
of some kind or another. That’s where the Lasso tools come in handy. This 
group of tools enables you to make any freeform selection your heart desires.
Elements offers three Lasso tools: the Lasso tool, the Polygonal Lasso tool, 
and the Magnetic Lasso tool. Each Lasso tool has its own special purpose in 
the world of freeform selections, and they’re simple to use. You just have to 
drag around the part of the image that you want to select. All that’s required 
is a decaffeinated, steady hand.
The selection you make is only as good as how accurately you can trace 
around your desired element. If you don’t make an exact selection the first 
time around, don’t worry. You can always go back and make corrections, as 
described in Book III, Chapter 5.
	
If, when making a selection, you find the mouse a little unwieldy, you may 
want to look into a digital drawing tablet, such as a Wacom tablet. Using a 
tablet makes using the Lasso tool — as well as other tools, like the Brush — 
much easier. Tablet lovers claim you’ll never revisit mouse usage again.
	
The Lasso and Polygonal Lasso tools have three settings on the Options 
bar — Feather, Anti-alias, and Refine Edge. The first two options work 
exactly as they do with the Marquee tools. To find out about Feather and 
Anti-alias, see the earlier section, “Using the Marquee options.” The Refine 
Edge option (brush button) does exactly that — cleans up the edges of your 

248
Freeform Selecting with the Lasso Tools
selection. You also find this command in the Options bar for the Magic Wand 
and Quick Selection tools. Keep in mind that you can apply this option to 
any existing selection, no matter how you got that selection, by choosing 
Select➪Refine Edge.
Here’s the scoop on the settings for the Refine Edge option:
	
✓	Smooth: Smoothes out the jaggedness along the selection edge.
	
✓	Feather: Softens the edges of a selection. Move the slider to increasingly 
create a softer, more blurred edge.
	
✓	Contract/Expand: Decreases or increases your selected area.
	
✓	Standard or Overlay mode: Enables you to preview your selection in 
one of two modes. Click the Custom Overlay Color icon to preview your 
selection with your edges hidden and a semi-opaque layer of color (that 
shows onscreen only) in your unselected area. Double-click the icon to 
change the color and opacity of the overlay. Press F to cycle between 
Standard and Overlay views. Press X to hide your selection edges.
	
✓	Zoom tool: Enables you to zoom into your image to see the effects of 
your settings.
	
✓	Hand tool: Lets you pan around your document window to see the 
effects of your settings on various portions of your image.
Using the Lasso tool
Making a selection with the Lasso tool is basically like tracing an outline 
around an element on a sheet of paper.
To make a selection by using the Lasso tool, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select the Lasso tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 It’s the tool that looks like a rope, hence the moniker “lasso.” You can 
also use the keyboard shortcut by pressing the L key. If the Lasso isn’t 
visible, press Shift+L to cycle through the various Lasso tools.
	
2.	 Position the cursor anywhere along the edge of the element you want 
to select.
	
	 The hot spot (the leading point) of the Lasso cursor is the end of the 
rope. If you need a little visual help, press the Caps Lock key, which 
switches your cursor to a crosshair.
	
	 Zoom in on the image a bit if you need to better see your edges.
	
	 In our example, we started at the bottom of the butterfly wing, as shown 
in Figure 1-6.
	
3.	 Hold down the mouse button and trace around the element, trying to 
include only what you want to select.

	 While you trace, an outline forms that follows the movement of your 
mouse.
	
	 Don’t release the mouse button until you complete the selection by clos­
ing the loop and returning to your starting point. When you release the 
mouse button, Elements assumes you’re done and closes the selection 
from wherever you release the mouse button to your starting point.
	
4.	 Continue tracing until you return to your starting point; release the 
mouse button.
	
	 Elements rewards you with a selection border that matches your Lasso 
line, as shown in Figure 1-7.

Selecting straight sides with 
the Polygonal Lasso tool
The Polygonal Lasso tool is at its best when selecting straight-sided sub­
jects, such as city skylines, buildings, and stairways. Unlike the Lasso tool, 
the Polygonal Lasso tool has rubber band–like qualities, and instead of drag­
ging, you click and release the mouse button at the corners of the object 
that you’re selecting.
Follow these steps to select with the Polygonal Lasso tool:
	
1.	 Select the Polygonal Lasso tool in the Tools panel.
	
	 You can also use the keyboard shortcut by pressing the L key. If the 
Polygonal Lasso isn’t visible, press Shift+L until you get the tool. It looks 
like the Lasso tool, but it has straight sides.
	
2.	 Click and release at any point along the edge of the desired element.
	
	 We like starting at a corner.
	
3.	 Move (don’t drag) the mouse and click and release at the next corner 
of the element. Continue clicking and releasing at the various corners 
of the object.
	
	 The line stretches out from each corner that you click, like a rubber band.
	
4.	 To close a selection, return to your starting point and click and 
release.
	
	 When you place the cursor over the starting point, a small circle 
appears next to the cursor, indicating that you’re at the right place for 
closing the selection. A selection marquee that matches your Polygonal 
Lasso line appears, as shown in Figure 1-8.
	
Some objects have both curves and straight sides. No problem. Hold down 
the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) to have the Polygonal Lasso tool tempo­
rarily transform into the regular Lasso tool. Then, click and drag to select 
the curves. Release the Alt (or Option) key to return to the Polygonal Lasso 
tool. This trick also works with the other Lasso tools.
Hugging edges with the Magnetic Lasso tool
The last Lasso tool is the Magnetic Lasso, which works by analyzing the col­
ors of the pixels between the elements in the foreground and the elements in 
the background. Then, it snaps to, or hugs, the edge between the elements, 
as if the edge had a magnetic pull.
	
Not always the easiest tool to manipulate, the Magnetic Lasso tool performs 
best when your image has a well-defined foreground object and good con­
trast between that object and the background — for example, a dark moun­
tain range against a light sky or a black silhouette against a white wall.

The Magnetic Lasso tool has some unique settings, found in the Options bar, 
which you can adjust to control the sensitivity of the tool and thus aid in 
your selection task.
	
We recommend starting out by experimenting with the Magnetic Lasso tool 
using its default settings. If the tool isn’t cooperating, play with the options.
The Feather, Anti-alias, and Refine Edge options work as they do with the 
Marquee and Lasso tools. Here are the remaining options:
	
✓	Width: This option, measured in pixels from 1 to 256, determines how 
close to the edge you have to move the mouse before the Magnetic 
Lasso tool snaps to that edge. Decrease the value if the object’s edge 
has a lot of indentations and protrusions or if the image has low con­
trast. Increase the value if the image has high contrast or smooth edges.
	
✓	Edge Contrast: Measured in percentages from 1 to 100, this option speci­
fies the contrast required between the object and its background before 
the Magnetic Lasso tool snaps to the edge. If the image has good 

252
Freeform Selecting with the Lasso Tools
contrast between the foreground element and its background, use a high 
percentage.
	
✓	Frequency: This setting, measured in percentages from 0 to 100, speci­
fies how many fastening points (points anchoring the selection line) to 
place on the selection line. The higher the value, the more fastening 
points used. If the element you want to select has a fairly smooth edge, 
keep the value low. If the edge is jagged or has a lot of detail, try a higher 
value to get a more-accurate selection.
	
✓	Tablet Pressure (Pen icon): If you own a pressure-sensitive drawing tab­
let, select this option to make an increase in stylus pressure to cause the 
edge width to decrease.
Follow these steps to use the Magnetic Lasso tool:
	
1.	 Select the Magnetic Lasso tool in the Tools panel.
	
	 You can also press the L key if the tool is visible. If it isn’t, press Shift+L 
to cycle through the Lasso tools. The tool looks like a straight-sided 
lasso with a magnet on it.
	
2.	 Click and release on the edge of the element you want to select to 
place the first fastening point.
	
	 Start anywhere, but be sure to click the edge between the element you 
want and the background you don’t want.
	
3.	 Move your cursor around the object without clicking.
	
	 The Magnetic Lasso tool creates a selection line similar to the other 
lasso tools while placing fastening points that anchor down the selection 
line (see Figure 1-9). Think of it as the way you might cordon off an area 
of your yard with ropes and stakes.
	
	 Here are a couple tips to keep in mind when working with the Magnetic 
Lasso tool:
	
•	 If the Magnetic Lasso tool starts veering off the edge of your object, 
back up your mouse and click and release to force a fastening point 
farther down on the line.
	
•	 If the Magnetic Lasso tool adds a point where you don’t want one, sim­
ply press your Backspace (Delete on a Mac) key to delete it.
	
•	 If the Magnetic Lasso is misbehaving, you can temporarily switch to 
the other Lasso tools. To select the Lasso tool, press the Alt key 
(Option key on the Mac), and then press the mouse button and drag. 
To select the Polygonal Lasso tool, press the Alt (or Option) key and 
click; don’t drag.
	
4.	 Continue moving the mouse around the object and then return to your 
starting point; click and release the mouse button to close the 
selection.

Performing Wand Wizardry
The Magic Wand has been around since the beginning of the digital-imaging 
era. You’d think, with a name like Magic Wand, it’d grant your every selec­
tion wish with a mere click. Well, yes and no. The success of the Magic Wand 
really depends on your particular image.
It’s a no-brainer to operate. Click the element you want within your image, 
and the Magic Wand makes a selection. This selection is based on the color 
of the pixel (the target pixel) directly under the cursor when you click. If 
other pixels are similar in color to your target pixel, Elements includes them 
in the selection. What’s sometimes hard to predict, however, is how to 
determine how similar the color has to be to get the Magic Wand tool to 
select it. That’s where the Tolerance setting comes in. First, here’s a little 
info on Tolerance so you can better wield the Wand.

254
Performing Wand Wizardry
Talking about Tolerance
The Tolerance setting determines the range of color that the Magic Wand 
tool selects. The issue is that most images contain a few shades of a similar 
color. For example, consider an image of a field of grass. A few shades of 
green make up that field. Using the Magic Wand tool, if you click a darker 
shade of green, it selects all similar shades of green, but the lighter shades 
remain unselected. This is a sign that you need to increase the Tolerance 
level to select all the shades of the green grass. Tolerance is based on bright­
ness levels that range from 0 to 255. That being said
	
✓	Setting the Tolerance to 0 selects one color only.
	
✓	Setting the Tolerance to 255 selects all colors, or the entire image.
The default setting is 32; so whenever you click a pixel, Elements analyzes 
the value of that base color and then selects all pixels whose brightness lev­
els are between 16 levels lighter and 16 levels darker.
What if an image contains a few shades of the same color? It’s not a huge 
problem. You can try different Tolerance settings. Try a higher Tolerance 
setting if you didn’t quite pick up what you wanted in the first try, as shown 
in Figure 1-10. Conversely, if your wand selects too much, you can also lower 
your Tolerance setting. Or you can make multiple clicks of the Magic Wand 
to pick up additional pixels that you want to include in the selection.
Selecting with the Magic Wand tool
The Magic Wand tool works best when you have high-contrast images or 
images with a limited number of colors. For example, the optimum image for 
the Wand would be a solid-colored object on a white background. Skip the 
Wand if the image has a ton of colors and no real definitive contrast between 
your desired element and the background.
	
1.	 Select the Magic Wand tool in the Tools panel.
	
	 It looks like, well, a wand. You can also press the W key.
	
2.	 Click the portion of the image that you want to select, using the 
default Tolerance setting of 32.
	
	 The pixel that you click (the target pixel) determines the base color. 
Remember, the default value of 32 means that the Magic Wand tool 
selects all colors that are 16 levels lighter and 16 levels darker than the 
base color.
	
	 If you selected everything you wanted the first time you used the Magic 
Wand tool, give yourself a pat on the back. If you didn’t (which is proba­
bly the case), go to Step 3.

	 If the Magic Wand tool selected more than you wanted it to, lower the 
Tolerance setting. If it didn’t select enough, raise the setting.
	
	 Here are a few other options to specify:
	
•	 Anti-alias: This option subtly softens the edge of the selection. See 
“Using the Marquee options” earlier in this chapter for details.
	
•	 Contiguous: When this option is selected, the Magic Wand tool 
selects only pixels that are adjacent to each other. When this option 
is unselected, the Magic Wand tool selects all pixels within the range 
of tolerance, whether or not they’re adjacent to each other.

256
Painting with the Selection Brush
	
•	 Sample All Layers: If you have multiple layers and enable this option, 
the Magic Wand selects pixels from all visible layers. If unselected, 
the tool selects pixels from the 
active layer only. For more on 
layers, see Book VI.
	
•	 Refine Edge: This option 
enables you to clean up the 
selection edges. See the earlier 
section “Freeform Selecting 
with the Lasso Tools” for 
details on this option.
	
4.	 Click the portion of the image 
that you want to select.
	
	 Changing the Tolerance level 
doesn’t adjust the current selec­
tion, so you must start again by 
clicking your image. The Magic 
Wand tool then deselects the cur­
rent selection and makes a new 
selection — based on the new 
Tolerance setting, as shown in 
Figure 1-11. If it still isn’t right, you 
can adjust the Tolerance setting 
again. Unfortunately, it’s all about 
trial and error.
Painting with the Selection Brush
If the action of painting on a canvas is more up your alley, try out the 
Selection Brush. Using two different modes, you can either paint over areas 
of an image that you want to select or paint over areas you don’t want to 
select. The Selection Brush also lets you make a basic selection with another 
tool, such as the Lasso, and then fine-tune the selection by brushing addi­
tional pixels into or out of the selection.
Follow these steps to paint a selection with the Selection Brush:
	
1.	 Select the Selection Brush from the Tools panel or simply press the A 
key (or Shift+A if the tool isn’t visible).
	
	 This tool works in either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode.
	
2.	 Specify your Selection Brush options in the Options bar.
	
	 Here’s the scoop on each option:

•	 Brush Presets: Choose a brush from the presets drop-down panel. To 
load additional brushes, click the downward-pointing arrow to the 
left of Default Brushes and choose the preset library of your choice. 
You can select the Load Brushes command from the panel pop-up 
menu.
	
•	 Brush Size: Enter a brush size from 1 to 2500 pixels. You can also 
drag the slider.
	
•	 Mode: Choose between Selection and Mask. Choose Selection to add 
to your selection and choose Mask to subtract from your selection. If 
you choose Mask mode, you must choose some additional overlay 
options. An overlay is a layer of color (that shows onscreen only) 
that hovers over your image, indicating protected or unselected 
areas. You must also choose an overlay opacity between 1 and 100 
percent. You can also choose to change the overlay color from the 
default red to another color. This option can be helpful if the image 
contains a lot of red.
	
•	 Hardness: Set the hardness of the brush tip, from 1 to 100 percent.
	
3.	 If your Mode is set to Selection, paint over the areas you want to 
select.
	
	 You see a selection border. Each stroke adds to the selection. If you 
inadvertently add something you don’t want, simply press the Alt key 
(Option key on the Mac) and paint 
over the undesired area. After you 
finish painting what you want, 
your selection is ready to go.
	
4.	 If your Mode is set to Mask, paint 
over the areas that you don’t 
want to select.
	
	 When you’re done painting your 
mask, choose Selection from the 
Mode drop-down list or simply 
choose another tool from the 
Tools panel in order to convert 
your mask into a selection border.
	
	 While you paint, you see the color 
of your overlay. Each stroke adds 
more to the overlay area, as shown 
in Figure 1-12. When working in 
Mask mode, you’re essentially 
covering up, or masking, the areas 
you want to protect from manipu­
lation. That manipulation can be 
selecting, adjusting color, or per­
forming any other Elements

command. Again, if you want to remove parts of the masked area, press 
the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and paint.
	
	 If you painted the selection in Mask mode, the selection border is 
around what you don’t want. To switch to what you do want, choose 
Select➪Inverse.
	
	 The Mode you choose is up to you. One advantage to working in Mask 
mode is that you can partially select areas. By painting with soft brushes, 
you create soft-edged selections. These soft edges result in partially 
selected pixels. If you set the overlay opacity to a lower percentage, the 
pixels are even less opaque or “less selected.” If this “partially selected” 
business sounds vaguely familiar, it’s because this is also what happens 
when you feather selections, as we discuss earlier in this chapter.
Saving Time with the Quick Selection Tool
None of us ever have enough time, so any tool that can shave a few minutes 
off a selection task is welcome. The Quick Selection tool can do just that. 
Think of it as a combo Brush/Magic Wand/Lasso tool. Easy to use — and 
producing surprisingly good results — it’s sure to become a favorite part of 
your collection of selection tools.
To make short work of selecting by using this tool, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select the Quick Selection tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 The tool looks like a wand with a marquee around the end. It shares the 
same flyout menu as the Selection Brush tool. You can also press the A 
key — or press Shift+A if the tool isn’t visible.
	
	 This is one of the few tools that works in either Edit Full or Edit Quick 
mode.
	
2.	 Specify the options on the Options bar.
	
	 Here’s an explanation of the options:
	
•	 New Selection: The default option enables you to create a new selec­
tion. There are also options to add to and subtract from your 
selection.
	
•	 Brush Picker: Choose your desired brush settings. Specify the diame­
ter, from 1 to 2500 pixels. You can also specify hardness, spacing, 
angle, and roundness settings.
	
•	 Sample All Layers: If the image has layers and you want to make a 
selection from all the layers, select this option. If this option is left 
unselected, you can select only from the active layer.
	
•	 Auto-Enhance: Check this option to have Elements assist you with 
automatically refining your selection by implementing an algorithm.

fairly detailed, you may even need to break out the Lasso or another 
selection tool to make some final clean-ups.
Resizing Smartly with the Recompose Tool
	
The new Recompose tool is like a combination crop and transform tool. You 
can move elements closer together or even change the orientation of a land­
scape shot from horizontal to vertical without eliminating your most impor­
tant elements.
Follow these steps to recompose:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, select the Recompose tool from the 
Tools panel.
	
	 This tool shares the same flyout menu with the Crop tool.
	
2.	 Using the Brushes and Erasers in the Options bar, mark the areas you 
wish to protect and eliminate.
	
	 Although this step isn’t mandatory, it yields better results.
	
	 Here’s a description of these options:
	
•	 Mark for Protect Brush: Brush over the areas of the image you want to 
protect, or retain (strokes will be green). You don’t have to be super 
precise; just provide Elements an idea of what you want to keep (or 
remove, in the case of the next brush).
	
•	 Mark for Removal Brush: Brush over those areas you want to remove 
first (strokes will be red). Make sure to choose the area you don’t 
mind deleting at all, as shown in Figure 1-14.

F
or most people, getting the perfect, pristine selection on the first 
attempt is pretty difficult. A little too much caffeine or not enough shut 
eye, and that once steady hand is no longer so. Fortunately, Elements, being 
the compassionate digital-imaging friend that it is, understands this and 
doesn’t make you settle for inaccurate selections. You have many ways to 
modify and transform selections to refine them to the point of near-perfect 
accuracy. You can add or remove pixels from your selection, scale 
the selection outline, smooth out jagged edges, or switch 
what’s selected for what isn’t. In this chapter, we’ll show 
you how how to clean up and modify your selections and 
enable you to nail the desired element with precision.
If you haven’t already checked out the first chapter 
of Book IV and gotten a good grasp of how to create 
selections in the first place, you may want to start 
there.
Modifying Selections
Although the selection tools, such as the Lasso, Quick 
Selection, and Magic Wand, usually do a fair job of captur­
ing most of the desired selection, making a really accurate 
selection often requires some amount of modification and 
cleanup. If you give the selection a little extra TLC, you’re rewarded with 
more accuracy and precision. By adding and subtracting from the selection, 
you can refine it and ensure that you capture only what you really want.

264
Modifying Selections
With the multitude of tools and features in Elements, you can usually exe­
cute the task in more than one way. In this section, we show you how to use 
keyboard operations (along with your mouse) to modify your selections. But 
note that you can also use the four selection option buttons on the left side 
of the Options bar to create a new selection, add to a selection, subtract 
from a selection, or intersect one selection with another. You just choose 
the selection tool, click the selection option button you want, and drag (or 
click and release, if you’re using the Magic Wand or Polygonal Lasso tool). 
When you’re using the Selection Brush, the Add to Selection and Subtract 
from Selection buttons are also available.
	
When adding to a selection, a small plus sign (+) appears next to your cur­
sor. When subtracting from a selection, a small minus sign (–) appears. 
When intersecting two selections, a small multiplication sign (×) appears.
Adding to a selection
If your selection doesn’t contain all the elements you want to capture, you 
need to add those portions to your current selection.
To add to a current selection, simply hold down the Shift key and click and 
drag around the pixels you want to include when using the regular Lasso or 
the Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tool. If you’re using the Polygonal 
Lasso, click and release around the area. (We wouldn’t use the Magnetic 
Lasso tool to add to a selection; it’s way too cumbersome.)
You can also hold down the Shift key and click the area you want when using 
the Magic Wand tool, or drag on the area you want when using the Quick 
Selection tool.
	
After your first drag with the Quick Selection tool, your selection option but­
ton should convert to the Add to Selection button automatically. When using 
the Selection Brush in Selection mode, the selection option button is also set 
automatically to the Add to Selection button.
	
You don’t have to use the same tool to add to your selection that you used 
to create the original selection. Feel free to use whatever selection tool you 
think can get the job done. For example, it’s common to start off with the 
Magic Wand and clean up your selection with the Lasso tool. See Book IV, 
Chapter 1 if you need more info on selection tools.
Follow these steps to add to a circular selection, such as the one shown in 
Figure 2-1:
	
1.	 Make your first elliptical selection with the Elliptical Marquee tool, as 
shown in the top example in Figure 2-1.

Subtracting from a selection
Just as you can add to a selection marquee, you can also subtract from a 
selection. Here’s how to subtract from a current selection using the follow­
ing tools:
	
✓	Using the Lasso or the Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tool: Hold 
down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and drag around the pixels 
you want to subtract.
	
✓	Using the Magic Wand and Quick Selection tools: Hold down the Alt 
key (Option key on the Mac) and click the area you want to remove.
	
✓	Using the Polygonal Lasso tool: To subtract a straight-sided area, hold 
down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and click and release around 
the area.
	
✓	Using the Selection Brush tool: Hold down the Alt key (Option key on 
the Mac) and drag.

Avoiding Keyboard Collisions
In Figure 2-2, we first selected the frame by using the Polygonal Lasso tool. 
We didn’t use the obvious tool of choice — the Rectangular Marquee tool — 
because the frame wasn’t completely 
straight. To deselect the inside of the 
frame from the selection, we again used 
the Polygonal Lasso tool, holding down 
the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) 
and clicking at each corner of the 
inside of the frame to produce the 
selection shown.
Intersecting two selections
What happens when you hold down 
Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac) 
together? An intersection, that’s what. 
Holding down both keys while dragging 
with the Lasso and Marquee tools, 
clicking and releasing with the 
Polygonal Lasso tool, or clicking with 
the Magic Wand tool all create the 
intersection of the original selection 
with the second selection.
Avoiding Keyboard Collisions
Elements has a little conflict in its methods. With so many ways of doing 
things, sometimes you may have to fiddle with Elements to get it to do what 
you want. For example, when you press the Shift key, how does Elements 
know whether you want to create a perfect square or add to a selection? Or, 
what if you want to delete part of a selection while also drawing from the 
center outward? Both actions require the use of the Alt key (Option key on 
the Mac). There is a way out of this keyboard madness.
Adding a perfectly square or circular selection
To add a perfectly square or round selection to an existing selection, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Hold down the Shift key and drag when using the Rectangular or 
Elliptical Marquee tool.
	
	 Your selection is unconstrained.
	
2.	 While you drag, keeping your mouse button pressed, release the Shift 
key for just a moment, and then press and hold it again.
	
	 Your unconstrained selection suddenly snaps into a constrained square 
or circle.

3.	 Release the mouse button before you release the Shift key.
	
	 If you don’t release the mouse button before you release the Shift key, 
the selection shape reverts back to its unconstrained form.
	
You can bypass the above keyboard shortcuts by using the various selection 
buttons on the left side of the Options bar.
Deleting from an existing selection 
while drawing from the center out
To delete part of a selection while drawing from the center out, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 Position your mouse cursor in the center of your desired selection. 
Hold down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and drag when using 
the Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tool.
	
2.	 While you drag, keeping your mouse button pressed, release the Alt 
key (Option key on the Mac) for just a moment, and then press and 
hold it again.
	
	 You’re now drawing from the center outward.
	
3.	 Release the mouse button before you release the Alt key (Option key 
on the Mac).
	
Use this technique when you’re select­
ing a doughnut, tire, inflatable swim 
ring, or other circular items that have 
holes in the middle, as shown in 
Figure 2-3.
Using the Select Menu
Although you can add, subtract, and 
intersect selections by using the Shift 
and Alt keys (Option key on the Mac) 
and the selection option buttons on 
the Options bar, you can do even more 
with the commands on the Select 
menu, as shown in Figure 2-4. In this 
menu, you find ways to expand, con­
tract, smooth, and soften your selec­
tion, and even turn your selection inside out. You can also use this menu to 
automatically select similar colors. If you use the Select menu, your selec­
tions should be ready and rarin’ for action.

Using the Select Menu
Selecting all or nothing
The All and Deselect commands are 
pretty self-explanatory. To select 
everything in your image, or if your 
image has layers, everything in the cho­
sen layer, choose Select➪All or press 
Ctrl+A (Ô+A on the Mac). To deselect 
everything, choose Select➪Deselect, 
Ctrl+D (Ô+D on the Mac). Remember 
that you rarely have to use All. If you 
don’t have a selection border in the 
image, Elements assumes that you 
want to apply whatever command you 
execute to the entire image (or layer).
Reselecting a selection
If you’ve taken some valuable time to 
carefully lasso a spiky iguana from its 
perch on a mangrove tree, the last 
thing you want is to lose your hard-
earned selection border. But that’s 
what happens if you inadvertently 
click the image when you have an 
active selection border — it 
disappears.
Yes, technically, you can choose Edit➪Undo if you catch your error right 
away. And, you can access the Undo History panel to recover your selection. 
But a much easier solution is to choose Select➪Reselect, which retrieves 
your last selection.
	
The Reselect command works for only the last selection you made, so don’t 
plan to reselect a selection you made last Wednesday — or even two min­
utes ago — if you’ve selected something else after that selection. If you want 
to reuse a selection for the long term, save it, as we explain in the section 
“Saving and loading selections,” later in this chapter.
Inversing a selection
	
Sometimes, selecting what you don’t want is easier than selecting what you 
do want. For example, if you’re trying to select your cat Princess, photo­
graphed against a neutral background, why spend valuable time meticu­
lously selecting her with the Lasso tool, when you can just click the 
background with the Magic Wand tool?

menu.

is selected and obediently awaiting your 
next command, as shown in Figure 2-5.
Feathering a selection
In Chapter 1 of this minibook, we 
describe how to feather (soften or blur 
the edges of) a selection when using 
the Lasso and Marquee tools by enter­
ing a value in the Feather option in the 
Options bar. This method of feathering 
requires that you set your Feather 
radius before you create your selection.
A problem may arise with feathering 
before you select if later you want to 
modify your initial selection. When you 
make a selection with a feather, the 
selection border adjusts to take into account the amount of the feather. So, 
the resulting marquee outline doesn’t resemble your precise mouse move­
ment. As a result, modifying, adding, or subtracting from your original selec­
tion is pretty difficult.
	
A much better way to feather a selection is to make your initial selection 
without a feather, as shown in the left image of Figure 2-6. Clean up your 
selection as necessary and then apply your feather by choosing Select➪
Feather. In the dialog box, enter a radius value from .2 to 250 pixels and click 
OK. The resulting selection appears in the right image of Figure 2-6.
	
The radius is how far out in all directions the feather extends. A radius of 8 
means the feather extends 8 pixels outward from the selection outline. A 
large feather radius makes the image appear to fade out.
The Refine Edge command, which appears right after Feather in the Select 
menu, enables you to fine-tune your selection edges using various options. 
For full details on this option, see the section “Freeform Selecting with the 
Lasso Tools” in Book IV, Chapter 1.
Using the Modify commands
The Select➪Modify menu contains a group of modification commands that are 
lumped together categorically. You probably won’t use these options every day, 
but sometimes they can come in handy. Here’s the lowdown on each command:
	
✓	Border: Selects the area around the edge of the selection. You specify 
the width of the area from 1 to 200 pixels, and you get a border outline, 
as shown on the left in Figure 2-7. Choose Edit➪Fill Selection and fill the 
border with color, as shown in the right image in Figure 2-7.

what you don’t want and then inverse your 
selection.

Figure 2-6: You can more easily clean up your selection prior to applying a feather.
	
✓	Smooth: Rounds off the nooks, crannies, and jagged edges. Enter a 
radius value from 1 to 100 pixels, and Elements looks at each selected 
pixel and then includes or deselects the pixels based on the radius 
value. If most of the pixels are selected, Elements includes the strays; if 
most of the pixels are unselected, Elements removes these pixels. Start 
with 2 pixels or so — and if that doesn’t seem like enough, increase it by 
a few pixels.
	
	Use this command with great caution. It’s just too easy to get mushy, 
inaccurate selections.
	
✓	Expand: Increases the size of your selection by a specified number of 
pixels, from 1 to 100. This command comes in handy if you just miss the 
edge of an elliptical selection and want to enlarge it just a tad.
	
✓	Contract: Shrinks your selection by 1 to 100 pixels. When you’re com­
positing multiple images, you can benefit by slightly contracting your 
selection if you plan on applying a feather. This enables you to avoid 
picking up a fringe of background pixels around your selection.

Figure 2-7: The Border command creates a selection outline, which you can then fill with color.
	
	After you make a selection, contract it and then feather it before you drag 
it onto the canvas. This technique helps to create a natural-looking transi­
tion between the images in your composite. The amount you decide to 
contract and feather varies according to the resolution of the images. For 
example, if you’re using low-resolution (72 pixels per inch [ppi]) images, 
you may want to use 1 pixel for the Contract amount and 0.5 pixels for the 
Feather amount; higher-resolution images may warrant 2 to 3 pixels for 
the Contract amount and 1 to 2 pixels for the Feather amount. If resolution 
makes you scratch your head, see Book III, Chapter 1.
Applying the Grow and Similar commands
The Grow and Similar commands are often mentioned in the same breath 
with the Magic Wand tool. If you didn’t get the perfect selection on the first 
click — a very common occurrence, unfortunately — you can use the Grow 
command. For example, to include more in your selection, you increase the 
Tolerance setting and try again — hold down the Shift key and click the area 
to include. Or you can choose Select➪Grow. The Grow command increases 
the size of the selection by including adjacent pixels that fall within the 
range of Tolerance.
The Similar command is like Grow, only the pixels don’t have to be adjacent 
to be selected. The command searches throughout the image and picks up 
pixels within the Tolerance range.

272
Using the Select Menu
	
Both commands use the Tolerance value that’s displayed on the Options bar 
when you have the Magic Wand tool selected. Adjust the Tolerance setting 
to include more or fewer colors by increasing or decreasing the setting, 
respectively.
Saving and loading selections
If you’ve invested valuable time perfecting a complex selection, we highly 
recommend that you save it for future use. It’s extremely easy to do and will 
prevent you from having to start from square one again. Here’s what you do:
	
1.	 After you make your selection, choose Select➪Save Selection.
	
2.	 In the Save Selection dialog box, leave the Selection option set to New 
and enter a name for your selection, as shown in Figure 2-8.
	
	 The option defaults to New Selection.

Selection and choose a selection from the Selection drop-down list.
	
	 To inverse your selection, click the Invert box. Note that you also have 
options to add to, subtract from, or intersect with your selection. These

Modifying and

Selections
Moving and Cloning Selections
options can come in handy if you want to modify your existing selection. 
For example, you may select just the head of a person and not the full 
body. You later decide that you really need the whole person. Rather 
than make a whole new selection, you can select just the body and then 
choose Add to Selection, and you have your whole person. If you want, 
you can then save the whole person as a new selection for later use.
Moving and Cloning Selections
When you have your selection modified to perfection, you may then want to 
move it or clone it. To move a selection, simply grab the Move tool (the four-
headed arrow) in the Tools panel and then drag the selection.
Sounds easy enough, right? When you move the selection, however, be 
warned that the area where the selection used to reside is now filled with the 
background color, as shown in Figure 2-9. It turns out, though, that the back­
ground color appears only if you decide to move both the selection outline 
and the image pixels. But you don’t have to move both; you can move just the 
selection outline (without the pixels), as we explain in the section “Moving the 
selection outline, but not the pixels,” later in this chapter. Also, if you’re mov­
ing a selection on a layer, you’re left with transparent pixels (see Book VI).
	
The Move tool has a few options residing in the Options bar that are mostly 
relevant when working with layers. For a description of these options, see 
Book VI, Chapter 2.
Cloning
If you don’t want to leave a hole in your image, you can copy and move the 
selection, leaving the original image intact, as shown in Figure 2-10. Just hold 
down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and drag when using the Move 
tool. This action is often referred to as cloning because you’re essentially 
making a duplicate of a selected area and then moving that duplicate 
elsewhere.
Moving the selection outline, but not the pixels
If all you want to do is move the selection outline without moving the pixels 
underneath, for example, to better center an elliptical selection around what 
you want, avoid using the Move tool. Instead, choose any selection tool — a 
Marquee or Lasso tool — and then click anywhere inside the selection and 
just drag. That way, you move only the outline of the element, not the pixels 
of the element itself. You can also use the arrow keys to nudge a selection 
marquee.

274
Transforming Pixels
Figure 2-9: When you move a selection by using the Move tool, you 
leave a hole that reveals the background color.
Transforming Pixels
After you select an element, you may find you need to resize or reorient that 
element. Transforming involves scaling, rotating, skewing, distorting, flip­
ping, or adjusting the perspective of your pixels. Although you may consider 
these types of transformations somewhat pedestrian, we’re sure you’ll find 
them practical and useful in your daily digital-imaging chores.
Follow these steps to transform a selection:
	
1.	 Create your selection.
	
	 We leave this task up to you; just use your selection expertise (or refer 
to Book IV, Chapter 1 for assistance).
	
	 You can also apply transformations to a layer or to multiple layers. (For 
more on this topic, see Book VI.)

•	 Selection 180°, 90° Left, or 90° Right: Rotates the selection by speci­

3.	 To scale the selection, choose Image➪Resize➪Scale.
	
4.	 To freely transform, skew, distort, or adjust the perspective of a sec­
tion, choose Image➪Transform and then choose a transformation type 
from the submenu:
	
•	 Free Transform: Enables you to rotate, resize, skew, distort, and 
adjust perspective all within a single command. See the “Distorting

ductive command.
	
•	 Skew: Distorts your selection on a given axis.
	
•	 Distort: Distorts your selection with no restrictions on an axis.
	
•	 Perspective: Applies a one-point perspective to your selection.
	
	 As soon as you select your desired distortion and release the mouse 
button, a bounding box or transform box surrounds your selection, com­
plete with handles on the sides and corners. You don’t get a bounding 
box when you select the Flip or Rotate (by degrees) transformations 
(these commands just get applied to your image).
	
5.	 Depending on which transformation type you choose in Steps 2, 3, 
or 4, drag the appropriate handle:
	
•	 Free Rotate: Move your cursor outside the bounding box. When 
the cursor becomes a curved arrow, drag clockwise or counter-
clockwise. Hold down the Shift key to rotate in 15-degree increments.
	
	 Remember choosing Rotate 180°, 90° CW, or 90° CCW, or Flip 
Horizontal or Vertical just executes the command. Handle-dragging 
isn’t necessary.
	
•	 Scale: Corner handles work best for this transformation. Hold down 
the Shift key to scale proportionately. Hold down the Alt key (Option 
key on the Mac) to scale from the center.
	
•	 Skew: Drag a side handle.
	
•	 Distort: Drag a corner handle.
	
•	 Perspective: Drag a corner handle.
Distorting selected pixels with Free Transform
An efficient way to apply multiple transforma­
tions is to use the Free Transform command. 
Like the Transform command, the Free Trans­
form command surrounds the selection with 
a bounding box. Within the bounding box, 
you can scale, rotate, skew, distort, or apply 
perspective without having to choose the in­
dividual distortions. You just have to use the 
right keyboard shortcuts. To scale and rotate, 
use the same method as the Image➪Scale 
and Image➪Rotate➪Free Rotate commands. 
Here’s the scoop on the rest:
	✓	Skew: Ctrl+Shift-drag (Ô+Shift-drag on 
the Mac) on a side or corner handle.
	✓	Distort: Ctrl-drag (Ô-drag on the Mac) on 
any handle.
	✓	Perspective: Ctrl+Shift+Alt-drag (Ô+Shift+
Option-drag on the Mac) on a corner handle.
If you forget these tedious keyboard shortcuts, 
simply right-click with the mouse (Control-
click on the Mac) to access a context-sensi­
tive menu with the transform commands from 
which you can then select.

	 Elements executes all the transformations around a reference point. The 
reference point appears in the center of the transform box by default. You 
can move the reference point anywhere you want, even outside the 
bounding box. In addition, you can set your own reference point for the 
transformation by clicking a square on the reference point locator on the 
Options bar. Each square corresponds to a point on the bounding box.
	
	 You can also use the fields in the Options bar to perform most of your 
transformations. After choosing any of the transformation commands 
from the menu, fields for a numeric entry to scale, rotate, and skew 
appear in the Options bar.
	
	 Execute all your transformations in one fell swoop, as shown in Figure 
2-11, if possible. In other words, don’t scale a selection now and then 
five minutes later rotate it, and then five minutes after that distort it. 
Every time you apply a transformation to an image, you’re putting it 
through a resampling process. You want to limit how many times you 
resample an image because it has a degrading effect — your image starts 
to appear soft and mushy. Only flipping or rotating in 90-degree incre­
ments is resample free. For more on resampling, see Book III, Chapter 1.
	
6.	 After you transform the selection to your liking, double-click inside 
the bounding box or click the Commit button on the Options bar.
	
	 To cancel the transformation, press Esc or click the Cancel button on 
the Options bar.

	 Your selection is now magically transformed. If your image isn’t on a 
layer, you can end up with a hole filled with the background color after 
your image is transformed. Check out Book VI on layers to avoid this 
calamity.
	
When the Move tool is active, you can transform a layer without choosing a 
command. Select the Show Bounding Box option on the Options bar. This 
option surrounds the layer or selection with a box that has handles. Drag 
the handles to transform the layer or selection.
Putting It Together
Removing an Element from an Image
Sometimes, you remove a distracting element from a picture to provide a stronger focal 
point. Or maybe you just don’t want the element in the image. But remember, if you simply 
delete an unwanted element without cloning, you leave a hole (colored with the back­
ground color or transparent) in place of the element. Probably not what you want.
Follow these steps to remove an unwanted 
element (in this case, a bystander) from an 
image:
	
When you first attempt this technique, start 
with an image that has an element not 
physically attached to something you want 
to keep in the image.
	
1.	 Open an image that contains some­
thing you want to remove.
	
2.	 Use the selection tool of your choice 
to select the element that you want to 
remove.
	
	 In this step, you’re creating a selection 
border that you use to clone another 
area of the image.
	
	 You don’t have to be super-precise, so 
feel free to grab a Lasso tool. When 
you make your selection, be careful 
not to cut off any portion of the ele­
ment. Otherwise, you leave some stray 
pixels — a dead giveaway that 
Selection border

around the bystander on the right, as shown in the preceding figure.
	
3.	 Position your cursor inside the selection border, press and hold the mouse button, 
and drag your selection to move it horizontally (or vertically, if the image warrants 
it) to an area of the photo that you want to clone.
	
	 The selection border, shown in the figure on the left, is the only thing that we moved.
	
4.	 With the Move tool selected, position your cursor inside the selection marquee, 
hold down Alt key (Option key on the Mac), and then drag to move the cloned area 
on top of the element that you’re removing. Carefully match up the edges, as shown 
in the figure, release your mouse button, and then release the Alt key (Option key 
on the Mac).
	
5.	 Choose Select➪Deselect.
	
	 The cloned area now covers the element that you want to remove, as shown in the 
figure on the right. In the example, the sky selection now covers the bystander.

	 Depending on your image, you may 
want to choose Select➪Feather and 
enter a pixel or so before you move the 
cloned area. Feathering softens the 
edges and smoothes out the transition 
between the cloned area and the 
background. We didn’t feather our 
selection because it wasn’t necessary. 
Try it both ways to see which looks 
better. Use the Undo History panel to 
undo your steps, if necessary.
	
	 The final step is to clean up any telltale 
signs that the element was there.
	
6.	 Select the Clone Stamp tool and 
select a medium-size feathered brush 
from the Brush Preset Picker on the 
Options bar, hold down the Alt key 
(Option key on the Mac), and click a 
good area next to a seam or flaw; 
release the Alt key (Option key on the 
Mac) and then click the flaw.
	
	 If the Clone Stamp is a mystery to you, 
be sure to check out Book VIII, Chapter 1.
	
	 Repeat this step until you fix all the flaws and the clone blends in seamlessly with 
the background. Don’t get carried away with the Clone Stamp tool, or you may end 
up with a smudgy mess. Being light-handed is a good thing, as we were in the now-

ring out your inner artist by traveling 
through the chapters in this book. We’ve 
packed a lot of material in it covering drawing, 
painting, and adding text to your photos. By fol­
lowing some of the simple steps we present, you 
can become the artist you never dreamed you 
could be.

✓	Using Brush presets
✓	Creating basic and custom shapes
✓	Understanding vectors
✓	Setting Geometry options
F
eel free to keep on your street clothes for this chapter on drawing and 
painting. The tools you work with in Elements are self-cleaning and 
don’t require that you wear a smock. Painting is one of the basic skills you 
need to have down pat in Elements. After you get familiar with the tech­
nique of painting strokes and working with brushes, you’re well on your way 
to mastering more-advanced skills, such as retouching, which come easier 
to you if you already have some strong painting skills under your belt.
In tandem with painting, of course, comes drawing. The Elements 
shape tools add an important dimension to your drawing 
capabilities. This chapter introduces you to a plethora of 
tools and techniques. We start with painting and then 
move on to drawing. Master both, and they can serve 
you well.
Introducing the Pencil 
and Brush Tools
The Pencil and Brush tools are like chocolate and 
mint. Not only do they work well together, but they 
also share many important attributes. Just as important, 
however, are their differences. You can access these tools 
in the Tools panel. Press the B key to make the Brush tool 
appear by default. By pressing Shift+B, you can toggle between the 
Brush tool, the Impressionist Brush, and the Color Replacement tools. 
Strangely enough, to access the Pencil, which shares the same flyout menu, 
press the N key.

284
Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
Drawing with the Pencil tool 
The Pencil and Brush tools are very 
much alike, except that the Pencil tool 
has hard edges whereas the Brush 
tool can have soft, feathered edges. In 
fact, the edges of a pencil stroke can’t 
even be anti-aliased. Keep in mind that 
if you draw anything other than verti­
cal or horizontal lines, the lines have 
some jaggies when they’re viewed up 
close. But hey, don’t dismiss the 
Pencil. Those hard strokes can work 
great for Web graphics because they 
lend themselves to producing crisp-
edged images for display in a browser 
window. What’s more, the Pencil tool 
can erase itself, and it’s great for digi­
tal sketches, as shown in Figure 1-1.
You can do all the following with the 
Pencil tool:
	
✓	Drag the mouse to draw freehand 
lines.
	
✓	Click at one point, release the mouse button, and then Shift-click at a 
second point to draw a straight line between the points. As long as you 
hold down the Shift key, you can keep clicking to draw straight lines

✓	Press the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac) and click any area of color 
in the drawing to switch the foreground color to that hue.
To try out the Pencil tool, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select the Pencil tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 The Pencil tool shares a flyout menu with the Brush tool. You can press 
the N key to make it appear if it’s hidden underneath the Brush tool.
	
2.	 In the Options bar, choose your pencil options. Options include
	
•	 Brush preset: By default, the Pencil tool’s brush tip is the 1-pixel 
brush. Click the arrow and select your desired brush from the Brush 
Preset Picker drop-down panel that appears.
	
•	 Brush size: A preset brush’s pixel diameters are shown as text below 
a thumbnail image of the brush shape. If you want to change the size 
of that brush tip, drag the Size slider or enter a value.

•	 To load another preset library, click the Brushes pop-up menu at the 
top of the panel. You also find options to save, rename, or delete 
individual brushes and also save, load, and reset brush libraries.
	
3.	 If you want to draw using anything other than Normal mode, select a 
mode from the Mode options menu in the Options bar.
	
	 Blend modes alter the interaction of the color you’re applying with the 
color on your canvas. See more on blend modes in Book VI, Chapter 3.
	
4.	 In the Options bar, specify an Opacity percentage for your pencil 
strokes.
	
	 If you want your background to show partially through your strokes, 
select an opacity of less than 100 percent by using the slider or by typ­
ing an opacity percentage directly into the text box. The lower the per­
centage, the more the background images show through.
	
	 Your strokes must be on a separate layer above your images for you to 
be able to adjust the opacity and blend modes after you draw them. For 
more on layers, see Book VI, Chapter 1.
	
5.	 Select Auto Erase to enable that option.
	
	 This option erases portions of your pencil strokes. For example, say that 
the foreground color is black and the background color is white, and 
you apply some black strokes. With Auto Erase enabled, you apply white 
if you drag back over the black strokes. If you drag over the white back­
ground, you apply black.
	
6.	 Click and drag with the mouse to create your pencil lines.
Painting with the Brush tool
The Brush tool is a popular tool used throughout Elements in various incar­
nations, so getting to know this tool and how it operates is a good idea.
The most important dif­
ference between the 
Brush and the Pencil 
tools is that, by default, 
the Brush tool pro­
duces soft-edged lines, 
as shown in Figure 1-2. 
How soft those strokes 
are depends on which 
brush you use. By 
default, even the hard­
est brush has a slightly 
soft edge because it’s 
anti-aliased. Anti-
aliasing creates a single 
Pencil stroke

softness of their edges.

Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
row of partially filled pixels along the edges to produce the illusion of a 
smooth edge. You can also get even softer brushes, which employ 
feathering.
Although jagged edges are most apparent in diagonal lines, Elements applies 
anti-aliasing to brush-stroke edges, even in horizontal and vertical lines.
The Brush tool shares most of the basic options found in the Pencil tool, 
except that the Auto Erase feature isn’t available.
Here are a few tips on working with the Brush tool and its unique options:
	
✓	Select the Brush tool from the Tools panel, or press the B key (or 
Shift+B) until you get the Brush.
	
✓	In the Options bar, click the arrow and select your desired brush tip 
from the Brush Preset Picker drop-down panel that appears.
	
✓	Select a mode and opacity from the options on the Options bar.
	
✓	Drag to paint, click and Shift-click to paint straight lines, and hold down 
the Shift key while dragging to constrain the Brush tool to horizontal or 
vertical lines.
	
✓	Press the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac) and click any area of color 
to switch the foreground color to that color.
The Brush tool has several other options to select from:
	
✓	Airbrush: Click the Airbrush but­
ton on the Options bar to apply 
the Airbrush mode. This mode 
produces the spray effect you get 
with a traditional airbrush. The 
longer you hold down the mouse 
button, the more paint pumps 
out of the tool, and the wider the 
airbrush effect spreads, as shown 
in Figure 1-3.
	
✓	Tablet Options: If you’re using a 
pressure-sensitive digital drawing 
tablet, check the settings you 
want the tablet to control, includ­
ing size, scatter, opacity, round­
ness, and hue jitter (switching of 
color between foreground and 
background colors). The harder 
you press with the stylus, the 
greater the effect of these 
options.

✓	More Options: In the Options bar, click the Brush icon to access addi­
tional options, referred to as brush dynamics. Brush dynamics enable 
you to change the brush strokes as you apply them. Here is a quick low­
down on each option (see Figure 1-4):
Fade
Hue Jitter
Scatter
Spacing
Hardness
Angle and
Roundness
Figure 1-4: Specify brush options to change the stroke’s appearance.
	
•	 Fade: The lower the value, the quicker the stroke fades. Zero, how­
ever, creates no fade.
	
•	 Hue Jitter: This option varies the stroke between the foreground and 
background colors. The higher the value, the more frequent the 
variation.
	
•	 Scatter: The higher the value, the higher the number of brush marks 
and the farther apart they are.
	
•	 Keep These Settings for All Brushes: You can lock in these brush 
dynamics by selecting this check box, ensuring that every brush you 
select adopts these settings.
	
•	 Spacing: The higher the number, the more space between marks.
	
•	 Hardness: The higher the value, the harder the brush.

288
Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
	
•	 Angle: If you create an oval brush by adjusting the roundness, this 
option controls the angle of that oval brush stroke. It’s much easier 
to drag the points and the arrow on the diagram than to “guessti­
mate” values in the text boxes.
	
•	 Roundness: A setting of 100 percent is totally circular. The lower the 
percentage, the more elliptical your brush becomes.
Just as they do for the Pencil tool, more features for the Brush tool appear in 
the pop-up menu on the Brush Preset Picker drop-down panel (click the 
arrow at the top of the panel). Here’s a quick explanation of each:
	
✓	Save Brush: Allows you to save a custom brush as a preset. See the fol­
lowing section for details.
	
✓	Rename Brush: Don’t like the name of your brush? Give it a new one 
with this option.
	
✓	Delete Brush: Eliminate an unwanted brush with this option.
	
✓	Reset Brushes: Reverts your current brush library to the default.
	
✓	Save Brushes: Saves custom brushes in a separate library.
	
✓	Load Brushes: Loads a preset or custom brush library. They have 
names like Special Effect Brushes and Faux Finish Brushes. Select one to 
append the brushes to your current set or to replace the current set 
with the library you select. (A dialog box appears that offers a choice of 
either action.)
	
✓	The display options: A set of commands that enables you to change the 
way your brush tips are displayed in the drop-down panel. The default 
view is Stroke Thumbnail, which displays the appearance of the stroke. 
Other commands include Text Only (text names of brush tips), Small 
and Large Thumbnail (thumbnail images with diameter in pixels), and 
Small and Large List (thumbnail images with text names).
	
You can also manage brush tip libraries by using the Preset Manager 
(choose Edit➪Preset Manager).
Getting artsy with the Impressionist Brush
The Impressionist Brush is designed to paint over your photos in a way that 
makes them look like fine art paintings. You can set various options that 
change the style of the brush strokes.

289
Book V 
Chapter 1
Painting and 
Drawing with 
Elements
Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
Here’s how to use this artistic brush:
	
1.	 Select the Impressionist Brush from the Tools panel.
	
	 It looks like a brush with a curlicue next to it. You can also press the B 
key, or Shift+B, to cycle through the brushes.
	
2.	 Set the brush options.
	
	 The Brushes, Size, Mode, and Opacity options are identical to those for 
the Brush tool, described in the previous section “Painting with the 
Brush tool.” You can also find some unique options on the More Options 
panel, indicated by the Impressionist Brush icon:
	
•	 Style: This drop-down list contains various brush stroke styles, such 
as Dab and Tight Curl.
	
•	 Area: Controls the size of your brush stroke. The larger the value, the 
larger the area covered.
	
•	 Tolerance: Controls how similar color pixels have to be before 
they’re changed by the brush stroke.
	
3.	 Drag on your image and paint with your brush strokes, as shown in 
Figure 1-5.
	
	 The best way to get familiar with the Impressionist Brush is to open 
your favorite image and experiment with the tool.
Creating a custom brush
After playing with all the various options, if you really like the personalized 
brush you’ve created, save it as a preset so that you can access it again and 
again. Click the arrow at the top of the Brush Preset Picker drop-down panel 
and choose Save Brush from the pop-up menu. Name the brush and click 
OK. Your new custom brush shows up at the bottom of the Brush Preset 
Picker drop-down panel.
There’s one other way to create a brush. Elements enables you to create a 
brush from all or part of your image. The image can be a photograph or 
something you’ve painted or drawn.
Here’s how to create a brush from your image:
	
1.	 Select part of your image with any of the selection tools.
	
	 If you want to use the entire image or entire layer, deselect everything.
	
	 For more on selections, see Book IV, Chapter 1.

Figure 1-5: The Impressionist Brush transforms your photo into a painting.
	
2.	 Choose Edit➪Define Brush or Edit➪Define Brush from Selection.
	
	 You see one command or the other, depending on what you do in Step 1.
	
3.	 Name the brush and click OK in the dialog box.
	
	 The new brush shows up at the bottom of your Brush Preset Picker 
drop-down panel. Note that your brush is only a grayscale version of 
your image. When you use the brush, it automatically applies the color 
you’ve selected as your foreground color, as shown in Figure 1-6.

Putting It Together
Colorizing Black-and-White Images
Just as there are artistic reasons for shooting a photo in black and white, there are also 
valid arguments for converting a grayscale image into a color one. Perhaps the picture 
is an old one, taken before color film was widely used, and you want to colorize it. Or you 
may come across a monochrome image that would look more interesting in color. Ele­
ments can let you add back the missing colors to your original black-and-white pictures 
or can give you free rein to create your own customized color image.
In our example, we chose a black-and-white photo of an adorable little girl. Rather than 
trying to duplicate a color photograph, we want to apply a technique that mimics the 
subtle, hand-colored look of the Marshall’s Photo Coloring System of pigments, photo 
oils, spot colors, retouch pencils, and other products popular in the ’50s and ’60s. You 
may have also seen this look used in greeting cards featuring children.
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open a grayscale image in Elements.
	
2.	 Choose Image➪Mode➪RGB Color to convert the grayscale image to a full-color 
image (even though it currently lacks color).
	
3.	 Choose Layer➪New➪Layer.

	 This creates a new transparent layer to paint on, as shown in the figure. Although 
you can paint directly on an image, using a blank layer is safer — and gives you 
more flexibility in editing when you make a mistake. (For more information on work­
ing with layers, see Book VI, Chapter 1.)

4.	 In the New Layer dialog box that appears, name the layer and then click OK.
	
	 You can paint all your colors on a single layer, but you may find that using a separate 
layer for each part of the face lets you fade that color in and out as required to blend 
smoothly with your other hues.
	
5.	 Select the Color mode from the Blend Mode drop-down list in the Layers panel.
	
	 Elements uses this mode to combine the painting layer with the image layer, enabling 
you to apply color while retaining the details of the underlying image.
	
6.	 Select a color you want to apply from the Swatches panel or use the Color panel to 
mix your own.

	 For details on using color, see Book III, Chapter 4.
	
7.	 Select the Brush tool from the Tools panel.
	
8.	 Click the down arrow next to the Brush Preset Picker on the Options bar and select 
a brush from the drop-down panel.
	
	 Start with a soft-edged brush.
	
	 The Airbrush option on the Options bar creates a very subtle and soft effect. Just be 
sure you pick the kind of brush that works best for the area of the picture you’re col­
orizing. (Use a small, fuzzy brush for smaller areas and use a bigger, sharper brush 
for more defined lines and wider areas.)
	
9.	 Paint all the parts of the image where you want to apply color.
	
	 If you make a mistake, you can use the Eraser tool (or the Undo History panel, see 
Book III, Chapter 5) to erase the bad strokes without affecting the underlying gray­
scale image because you’re painting on a separate layer.
	
	 In our example, we chose a nice, light blue to change the color of the girl’s eyes, as 
shown in the figure. A small, fuzzy brush is perfect for a small area such as the eyes.

	 Change brushes as necessary by clicking the Brush Preset Picker on the Options 
bar and selecting a larger or smaller brush.
	
10.	 When you finish with that area of the image, create a new layer for each of the 
image’s main components and repeat Steps 4–9 with an additional color.
	
	 We painted the eyes, lips, cheeks, hair, and hair highlights separately because cre­
ating natural, subtle effects with people’s skin, hair, and eyes takes a special touch:
	
✓	 Eyes: When painting the eyes, paint only the irises and leave the pupils their 
original black color. Don’t paint over the catchlights in the eyes, either. 
(Catchlights are reflections of light sources, such as windows or the flash.)
	
✓	 Lips: Color the inner surface of the lips a darker, rosier pink than the outer sur­
face. Lips look best when portrayed in at least two shades. Don’t forget to color 
the gums with an even lighter pink.

294
Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
continued
	
✓	 Hair: Hair looks best when the highlights and darker portions are slightly differ­
ent colors.
	
✓	 Cheeks: To put a little blush in the cheeks, choose the Airbrush option on the 
Options bar and work with a relatively large brush size. Apply a good dash of 
color to each cheek and a lighter bit of color to the forehead and chin, as shown 
in the figure.

	 We left the clothes and background uncolored to emphasize that the focal point 
is the girl’s face.
	
11.	 For the overall skin tone, choose a different technique, using the Hue/Saturation 
command.
	
	 This technique works especially well with those who have naturally dark complex­
ions. You can choose to paint the skin with a brush or use this technique:
	
✓	 Duplicate the grayscale Background layer and then choose Enhance➪Adjust 
Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation.
	
✓	 Choose the Colorize option and move the Hue slider to the left to produce a 
sepia tone. We set our Hue to 36 and Saturation to 25 percent and then click OK 
to colorize this layer.

✓	 Use the Eraser tool to remove everything in the colorized layer that isn’t skin. In 
our example, we removed the hair, background, eyes, lips, teeth, and clothing. 
This result is a nice sepia tone to the face, as shown in the figure.

	 Be sure to pick a color that’s as close to life as possible. If the subject has darker 
skin, you may need to move away from rosier blush tones.
	
12.	 When you finish coloring your layers, experiment with different opacity levels for 
each colorized layer to see whether more-transparent hues might look better.
Creating Shapes
Although we’re big fans of photos and pixels, sometimes you have the need 
for a vector shape or two. Maybe you need to create a button for a Web page 
or a simple logo for a poster. In these instances, drawing a vector shape with 
one of the shape tools does the job.

296
Creating Shapes
Before we discuss the ins and outs of creating shapes, here’s a little over­
view that explains the difference between pixels and vectors (both types are 
shown in Figure 1-7):
	
✓	Pixel images describe a shape in terms of a grid of pixels. When you 
increase the size of a pixel-based image, it loses quality and begins to look 
blocky, mushy, and otherwise nasty. For more details on resizing pixel-
based images and the ramifications of doing so, see Book III, Chapter 1.
	
✓	Vectors describe a shape mathematically. The shapes comprise paths 
made up of lines, curves, and anchor points. Because vector shapes are 
math based, you can resize them without any loss of quality whatsoever.
Vector image
Pixel image
Figure 1-7: Elements images fall into one of two camps — vector or pixel.
When you create a shape in Elements, you’re creating a vector-based element. 
Shapes reside on a special kind of layer called, not surprisingly, a shape layer.
Drawing a shape
Elements offers an assortment of shape tools for you to choose from. Follow 
these steps to draw a shape in your document:
	
1.	 Select a shape tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 You can also press the U key, or Shift+U to cycle through the tools. You 
can select from the following shape tools (as shown in Figure 1-8):

•	 Rectangle/Ellipse: The Rectangle and Ellipse shapes have no special 
parameters on the Options bar; however, they both behave much 
like their counterparts among the selection tools. Hold down the 
Shift key while dragging a shape to produce a perfect square or cir­
cle; hold down Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac) to additionally 
draw the shape outward from the center.

298
Creating Shapes
	
•	 Rounded Rectangle: This shape has the same options as the 
Rectangle, with the addition of a radius value used to round off the 
corners of the rectangle.
	
•	 Polygon: This tool creates a polygon with a specified number of 
sides, from 3 to 100.
	
•	 Line: Creates a line with a width from 1 to 1000 pixels. You can also 
add an arrowhead at either or both ends.
	
•	 Custom Shape: You can find numerous preset custom shapes to 
choose from. As with any shape, hold down the Shift key to constrain 
proportions or the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) to draw from the 
center out.
	
•	 Shape Selection: Use this tool to select and move your shapes.
	
2.	 In the Options bar, click the down-pointing arrow just to the right of 
the shape tools to specify Geometry options.
	
	 Each shape has its own options. For a detailed explanation, see the sec­
tion “Specifying Geometry options,” later in this chapter.
	
	 If you chose the Custom Shape tool in Step 1, click the down-pointing 
arrow to access the drop-down Custom Shapes panel and choose your 
desired shape. You can access more preset shape libraries via the pop-up 
menu at the top of the panel.
	
3.	 Select your desired color from the Color drop-down panel on the 
Options bar.
	
	 Click the More Colors button 
(down-pointing arrow) to access 
the Color Picker for additional 
color choices.
	
4.	 Select a style from the Style drop-
down panel.
	
	 To spice up the shape with bevels 
and interesting edges, choose a 
style from the panel. For more on 
styles, see Book VII, Chapter 3.
	
5.	 Drag in the document to draw the 
shape you’ve defined.

Creating Shapes
Drawing multiple shapes in a shape layer
After you create a shape layer, you can draw additional shapes on that layer. 
You can add, subtract, exclude overlapping, and intersect shapes in exactly 
the same way you do with selections, as described in Book IV, Chapter 2. 
Follow these steps:
	
1.	 After you create the first shape, as we explain in the preceding sec­
tion, select a state button on the Options bar:
	
•	 Add to Shape Area: Combines and joins two or more shapes
	
•	 Subtract from Shape Area: 
Subtracts one shape from 
another shape
	
•	 Intersect Shape Areas: Creates a 
shape only from the areas that 
overlap
	
•	 Exclude Overlapping Shape 
Areas: Creates a shape from 
only the areas that don’t 
overlap
	
2.	 Choose a shape tool and draw the 
next shape.
	
	 We finished our drawing, as shown 
in Figure 1-10, by adding a face to 
our Elvis impersonator.
	
	 You can also hold down the Shift 
key to temporarily switch to Add to Shape Area while drawing a new 
shape. Hold down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) to temporarily 
switch to Subtract from Shape Area. This works just like adding or sub­
tracting selections.
Specifying Geometry options
Geometry options for your shapes help define how the shapes look. Click the 
down-pointing arrow at the end of the row of Shape tools on the Options bar 
to access the Geometry options described in the following sections.
Rectangle and Rounded Rectangle Geometry options
Here are the Geometry options for the Rectangle and Rounded Rectangle 
shapes:
	
✓	Unconstrained: Enables you to freely draw a rectangle of any shape or size.
Figure 1-10: Add to your shape layer.

300
Creating Shapes
	
✓	Square: Constrains the shape to a perfect square. (You can also hold 
down the Shift key to do the same thing on the fly.)
	
✓	Fixed Size: Lets you draw rectangles only in fixed sizes. Specify the 
exact size by entering a width and height.
	
✓	Proportional: Enables you to define an aspect ratio, or proportion, for 
the rectangle. Type 3 into the W box and 4 into the H box to constrain 
yourself to drawing any sized rectangle with fixed proportions in a 3:4 
ratio.
	
✓	From Center: Enables you to draw the shape from the center outward.
	
✓	Snap to Pixels: Aligns the edges of a rectangle or rounded rectangle to 
the pixels on your screen.
	
✓	Radius: For rounded rectangles, uses an inscribed circle of the given 
radius to round off the corners of a rectangle.
Elliptical-shape Geometry options
The Ellipse shape has many of the same options available for rectangles. Of 
course, instead of being able to create a perfect square, you can restrain the 
shape to be a perfect circle. Also, the Snap to Pixels option (available for 
rectangles) doesn’t exist for ellipses.
Polygon Geometry options
These are the Geometry options for the polygon:
	
✓	Radius: Controls the distance from the center of a polygon to its outer 
points.
	
✓	Smooth Corners: Rounds off the corners.
	
✓	Star: Creates a nonconvex polygon, also known as a star.
	
✓	Indent Sides By: Determines the amount the sides indent inward.
	
✓	Smooth Indents: Rounds off the inner of indented sides.
	
✓	Sides: Lets you indicate the number of sides for a polygon or the num­
ber of points for a star.
Line Geometry options
The Line shape’s Geometry settings include whether to put arrowheads at 
the start or end of the line, neither, or both. You can also specify the width, 
length, and concavity settings, which affect the arrowhead shapes.

301
Book V 
Chapter 1
Painting and 
Drawing with 
Elements
Creating Shapes
Custom Shape Geometry options
The Custom Shape options are similar to those you can find for the other 
shapes — with a couple of additions:
	
✓	Defined Proportions: Draws a shape based on the original proportions 
you used when you created it.
	
✓	Defined Size: Draws a shape based on its original size when you 
created it.
Editing shapes
You can edit shapes that you create by using a variety of tools and tech­
niques. Here’s a list of the things you can do to modify your shapes:
	
✓	Select: Choose the Shape Selection tool to move one or more shapes in 
their layers. This tool shares a flyout menu with the shape tools.
	
✓	Move: Choose the Move tool (press the V key) to move the entire con­
tents of the shape layer.
	
✓	Delete: Select a shape and press Delete to remove it.
	
✓	Transform shapes: Choose the Shape Selection tool and select your 
shape. Choose Image➪Transform Shape and then choose your desired 
transformation.
	
✓	Change the color: Double-click the thumbnail of the shape layer on the 
Layers panel. This action takes you to the Color Picker, where you can 
choose a new color.
	
✓	Clone a shape: Hold down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and 
move the shape with the Move tool.
	
To convert your vector-based shape into a pixel-based shape, click the 
Simplify button on the Options bar or choose Layer➪Simplify Layer. Note 
that you can’t edit a shape after you simplify it, except to modify the pixels. 
But you can now apply filters to the layer. See Book VII, Chapter 1 for more 
on fun with filters.

Chapter 2: Filling and Stroking
In This Chapter
✓	Filling and stroking selections
✓	Pouring with the Paint Bucket tool
✓	Working with gradients
✓	Creating and applying patterns
E
lements offers several ways to create elements (say, geometric shapes) 
out of pixels. Filling and stroking such elements are two of the most 
popular commands at your disposal. The Fill command adds a color or a 
pattern to the entire selection, whereas the Stroke command applies the 
color to only the edge of the selection border.
This chapter shows you how to fill and stroke your selections. If filling and 
stroking with solid color is just too mundane for you, we also show you how 
to create and apply multicolored gradient blends as well as the best ways to 
make and use patterns. After reading this chapter, you’ll have your “fill” of 
different fills and strokes.
	
You want to be in the Editor in Edit Full mode for your filling, 
stroking, gradient, and pattern activities.
Filling a Selection with a Solid Color
You won’t find a Fill tool on the Tools panel. 
Elements avoids the crowded panel and places the 
Fill and Stroke commands on the Edit menu. When 
you want to fill your selection with just a solid 
color, you use either the foreground or background 
color, among other options. (These colors appear 
at the bottom of the Tools panel, as we explain in 
Book III, Chapter 4.)

Filling a Selection with a Solid Color
304
The following steps show you the basics of filling a selection with either the 
foreground or background color:
	
1.	 Choose the selection tool of your choice and create your selection on 
a layer.
	
	 Although you don’t have to create a new layer, we recommend it. That 
way, if you don’t like the filled selection, you can delete the layer, and 
the image or background below it remains safe. See Book IV for all you

2.	 In the Tools panel, select either the foreground or background color 
and then choose a fill color.
	
	 If you need information on choosing a color, see Book III, Chapter 4.
	
3.	 Choose Edit➪Fill Selection.
	
	 Note that if you don’t have an 
active selection border in your 
image, the command says Fill 
Layer and your entire layer is 
filled with your color or pattern.
	
	 The Fill Layer dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 2-1, appears.
	
4.	 Choose your desired fill from 
the Use pop-up menu.
	
	 You can select whether to fill 
with the foreground or back­
ground color.
	
	
You also can choose Color, 
Black, 50% Gray, White, or 
Pattern. If you select Color 
or Pattern, you must complete a couple additional steps, described in 
the next section “Filling Options and Tips.”
	
5.	 In the Blending area, specify whether to preserve transparency.
	
	 This option enables you to fill only the portions of the selection that 
contain pixels (the nontransparent areas).
	
	 Although you can also choose a blend mode (how the fill color interacts 
with colors below it) as well as an opacity percentage in the Fill Layer 
dialog box, we can’t really recommend doing so. Make adjustments on 
your layer later using the Layers panel commands. This gives you more 
flexibility for editing.

Filling Options and Tips
After you make a selection, you’re ready to use one of the filling options. You 
can use the Fill Layer dialog box (as described in the preceding section) to 
fill the selection with the foreground or background color; you can also 
choose to fill the selection with color, black, white, or gray. Elements is full 
of shortcuts and options.
Here are just a few. With the selection active
	
✓	Press Alt+Backspace (Option+Delete on the Mac) to fill it with the fore­
ground color. All areas within the selection, including transparent areas, 
fill with the color.
	
✓	Press Alt+Shift+Backspace (or Option+Shift+Delete on the Mac) to fill 
only the pixels in a selection with the foreground color, leaving any 
transparent pixels untouched.
	
✓	If you’re working on the Background layer, you can also fill the selection 
with the background color by pressing the Backspace (Delete on the 
Mac) key. (Pressing Backspace [Delete] on other layers creates a trans­
parent area that shows the image in the layer underneath the selection.)
	
✓	By selecting the Color option from the Contents drop-down list in the Fill 
Layer dialog box, you access the Color Picker where you can select any 
color your heart desires to fill your selection. For more on using the 
Color Picker, see Book III, Chapter 4.
	
✓	Select the Pattern option from the Contents drop-down list in the Fill 
Layer dialog box to fill the selection with a pattern. Click the arrow next 
to the pattern swatch and select a pattern from the drop-down panel. 
Click OK. To access additional pattern libraries, click the Pattern panel 
pop-up menu to select more pattern libraries.
	
✓	Paint part or all the interior of the selection by using a Pencil or Brush 
tool. This option lets you partially fill a selection using a bit of flexibility 
and creativity. When you paint a selection using Brush tools, Elements 
confines the paint inside the boundaries of your selection, as shown in 
Figure 2-2. For more on painting, see Book V, Chapter 1.
	
✓	Pour color from the Paint Bucket tool into the selection. (See more 
details in the next section.)
Pouring with the Paint Bucket Tool
The Paint Bucket tool operates much like a combination of the Fill command 
tool and the Magic Wand tool. It makes a selection based on similarly col­
ored pixels and then immediately fills that selection with color or a pattern. 
Just like the Magic Wand tool, this tool is used most successfully when you 
have a limited number of colors, as shown in Figure 2-3.

Figure 2-2: The marquee confines your brush strokes to the selected area.
To use the Paint Bucket tool, select it and click the area you want to fill with 
color. If you want a more precise fill, first make a selection and then click 
inside the selection border. It’s as simple as that. Before you click, however, 
specify your options, which are all on the Options bar:
	
✓	Fill: Select whether to fill with the foreground color or a pattern. If you 
want to use the foreground color, leave Pattern unchecked.
	
✓	Pattern: If you select Pattern, select a preset pattern from the drop-
down panel. You can also load patterns from pattern libraries or create 
a pattern of your own. Find more information on patterns in the section, 
“Working with Patterns,” later in this chapter.
	
✓	Mode: Select a blending mode to change how the fill color interacts with 
the color below it. Find details on these modes in Book VI, Chapter 3.
	
✓	Opacity: Adjust this value to make the fill more or less transparent.

Stroking a Selection

Figure 2-3: Select and fill simultaneously with the Paint Bucket tool.
	
✓	Tolerance: Just as you did with the Magic Wand tool, choose a 
Tolerance level (0 to 255) that specifies how similar in color a pixel must 
be before it’s selected and then filled. For more on Tolerance, see Book 
IV, Chapter 1.
	
✓	Anti-alias: Choose this option to smooth the edges between the filled 
and unfilled areas.
	
✓	Contiguous: If selected, this option selects and fills only pixels that are 
touching within your selection. If the option is unselected, pixels are 
selected and filled wherever they lie within your selection and within 
your tolerance range.
	
✓	All Layers: This option selects and fills pixels within the selection in all 
layers that are within the tolerance range.
	
As with other tools that fill, you can prevent the Paint Bucket tool from fill­
ing the transparent pixels. Just select the Transparency icon in the Lock 
area of the Layers panel.
Stroking a Selection
Stroking enables you to create colored outlines, or borders, of selections or 
layers. It’s up to you to decide whether to put the border inside, outside, or 
centered on the selection.

Stroking a Selection
308
To stroke a selection, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Tools panel, choose a foreground color.
	
2.	 In the image, make a selection on a layer using the selection tool of 
your choice.
	
	 Although you don’t have to create a new layer to stroke a selection, we 
recommend it. That way, if you don’t like the stroked selection, you can 
just delete the layer and your document remains unadulterated.
	
3.	 Choose Edit➪Stroke (Outline) Selection.
	
4.	 In the Stroke dialog box, specify options, as shown in Figure 2-4:
Figure 2-4: Apply strokes up to 250 pixels wide to your selection.
	
•	 Width: Enter a width of 1 to 250 pixels.
	
•	 Color: Click in the Color box to select the hue you want from the 
Color Picker.

•	 Location: Specify how Elements should apply the stroke in relation to 
your selection border. Note that the Inside option always gives you 
sharp corners on a rectangle. The Center and Outside options can 
result in blunt corners.
	
•	 Mode: This determines how the stroke color interacts with other col­
ors on the same layer.
	
•	 Opacity: The default value is 100%. If you want the stroke to be semi­
transparent, enter a lower value.
	
•	 Preserve Transparency: Select this option to apply the stroke only to 
nontransparent pixels. Note that if you choose this option on a new, 
blank layer, nothing will be stroked.
	
5.	 Click OK to apply the stroke.
	
	 We gave a 10-pixel centered stroke to our selection, as shown in 
Figure 2-4.
	
Instead of using the Stroke dialog box to adjust the Mode and Opacity set­
tings, we recommend creating a new layer for the stroke and then choosing 
different Mode and Opacity settings in the Layers panel. This approach gives 
you better flexibility in editing.
Working with Multicolored Gradients
If one color just doesn’t get you fired up, you’ll be happy to know that 
Elements enables you to fill a selection or layer with a gradient. A gradient is 
a blend of two or more colors that gradually dissolve from one into another. 
Elements provides a lot of preset gradients. But creating your own custom 
gradient is also fun and simple to do.
You can create the following gradient effects:
	
✓	Foreground to background: A transition from the current foreground 
color to the background color
	
✓	Foreground to transparent: A transition from the current foreground 
color to transparent, allowing whatever’s under the transparent portion 
to show through
	
✓	Black to white: A transition from black to white
	
✓	An array of colorful selections: A transition including rainbows, cop­
pery sheens, and other effects
	
You can load other libraries of gradients from those found in the menu of 
the Gradient panel. They have names such as Color Harmonies, Metals, and 
Special Effects.

Working with Multicolored Gradients
310
In addition to being able to control the appearance and application of a gra­
dient, you can also specify various Gradient options, which are all on the 
Options bar:
	
✓	Mode: Select a blending mode to change how the color of the gradient 
interacts with the colors below it.
	
✓	Opacity: Select how opaque or transparent the gradient is.
	
✓	Reverse: Reverse the order in which the colors are applied.
	
✓	Dither: Add noise, or random information, to produce a smoother gradi­
ent that prints with less banding (color stripes caused by the limitations 
of the printing process to reproduce a full range of colors).
	
✓	Transparency: Deselect this option to make Elements ignore any trans­
parent areas in the gradient, making them opaque instead.
Applying a preset gradient to a selection
Here’s how to apply a preset gradient:
	
1.	 Select the layer from the Layers panel.
	
	 If you want the gradient to fill only a portion of that layer, make your 
desired selection.
	
	 We recommend making the selection on a new layer so that you can edit 
the gradient later without harming the underlying image.
	
	 If you don’t make a selection, the gradient is applied to the entire layer 
or background.
	
2.	 Select the Gradient tool from the Tools panel, or press the G key.
	
3.	 Select one of the preset gradients from the Gradient Picker drop-down 
list on the Options bar.
	
	 Remember that you can choose other preset libraries from the panel 
pop-up menu. Libraries, such as Color Harmonies and Metals, contain 
interesting presets.
	
4.	 Select the gradient type by clicking one of the icons on the Options bar.
	
	 Figure 2-5 illustrates each gradient type:
	
•	 Linear: Blends the colors of the gradient in a straight line
	
•	 Radial: Blends the colors outward in a circular pattern
	
•	 Angle: Creates a counterclockwise sweep around the starting point, 
resembling a radar screen
	
•	 Reflected: Blends the colors by using symmetrical linear gradients on 
either side of the starting point
	
•	 Diamond: Blends the colors outward in a diamond pattern

	 We explain these options earlier in this section.
	
6.	 Place the cursor at the position in the layer or selection where you 
want to place the starting color of the gradient.
	
7.	 Drag in any direction to the end point for the gradient.
	
	 Longer drags result in a subtle transition between colors, whereas 
shorter drags result in a more abrupt transition. Hold down the Shift key 
while dragging to constrain the direction of the gradient so it’s perfectly 
horizontal or vertical or at an exact 45-degree angle.

8.	 Release the mouse button to apply the gradient.
	
	 We applied a pastel radial gradient to a selection of an abstract symbol 
in Figure 2-6.

Customizing and editing gradients
Although Elements includes dozens of different gradient presets, you may 
want to create your own. The Gradient Editor makes that task an easy one 
by letting you create your own custom gradient with as many colors as you 
want, which you can then save as a preset and reuse at any time.
The Gradient Editor has a lot of options, but it’s easy to use when you know 
what all the controls and options do. Follow these steps to create a simple, 
smooth gradient:
	
1.	 Select the Gradient tool from the Tools panel or press the G key.
	
2.	 Click the Edit button on the Options bar.
	
	 The Gradient Editor dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-7.

Figure 2-7: The Gradient Editor enables you to create custom

3.	 Pick an existing gradient preset from the Presets area to use as the 
basis for your new gradient.
	
4.	 Choose Solid or Noise from the Gradient Type pop-up menu.
	
	 As soon as you start to edit the existing gradient, the name of the gradi­
ent changes to Custom. A Noise gradient is one containing random col­
ors. Because the colors are random, each time you create a noise 
gradient, the result is different.
	
5.	 If you chose a Solid gradient in Step 4, adjust the Smoothness percent­
age to determine how smoothly one color blends into another.
	
6.	 If you chose a Noise gradient in Step 4, specify the options that follow 
and then skip to Step 15 to finish the gradient.
	
•	 Roughness: Adjust this slider to determine how smoothly or abruptly 
the colors transition from one stop to another.
	
•	 Color Model: Select the color model to set the range of color. See 
Book III, Chapter 4 for more on color models.

•	 Restrict Colors: Select this option to avoid oversaturated colors.
	
•	 Add Transparency: Select this option to include transparency in your 
gradient, if desired.
	
•	 Randomize: Use this option to change the colors in the gradient. 
Each time you click Randomize, you get a new set of colors.
	
7.	 If you’re creating a solid gradient, define the color of the starting point 
for your gradient. Click the left color stop under the gradient bar.
	
	 The triangle above the stop turns black to indicate you’re working with 
the starting point of the gradient. Because Noise gradients are random, 
you can’t define the colors.
	
8.	 Select the starting color by using one of these methods:
	
•	 Double-click the left color stop and select a color from the Color 
Picker that appears.
	
•	 Click the color swatch in the Stops area of the dialog box and choose 
a color from the Select Stop Color dialog box that opens.
	
•	 Select Foreground, Background, or User Color from the Color pop-up 
menu in the Stops area of the dialog box.
	 	
	 If you select Color with the Foreground or Background option, the 
color in the gradient changes automatically when you change the 
foreground or background color. The change doesn’t affect any gra­
dients you’ve already created, but it does affect any future gradients. 
However, when you open the Gradient Editor again, you can revert to 
the original foreground or background color by selecting the User 
Color option from the Color pop-up menu in the Stops area.
	
•	 Position the cursor (it appears as an eyedropper icon) anywhere in 
the gradient bar to select a start color from the bar, or position the 
cursor anywhere within an image on your screen and then click to 
select the color under the cursor.
	
9.	 Click the end point color stop at the right side of the gradient bar and 
use any of the methods described in Step 8 to choose the end color of 
the gradient.
	
10.	 Change the percentage of the amount of one color versus the other by 
moving the starting and ending points to the left or right. Drag the 
midpoint slider (a diamond icon that appears when you click an adja­
cent color stop) to adjust where the colors mix equally, 50–50.
	
	 You can also change the position of the midpoint by selecting it and typ­
ing a value into the Location box. The position of the color stops can 
also be changed this way.

11.	 (Optional) To add another color, click below the gradient bar at the 
position you want to add the color. Define a color using the new color 
stop as you did in Step 8.
	
12.	 (Optional) Repeat Step 11 for additional colors.
	
13.	 For the additional color stops, move the stops to the left or right to 
adjust the location of the start and end points for each color. Then, 
adjust the midpoint sliders between the colors.
	
14.	 If you change your mind, redefine the color of the color stop or 
remove a color stop altogether by dragging it down or up from its 
position on the gradient bar.
	
15.	 After your edits are complete, enter a name for your gradient in the 
Name field and then click the New button.
	
	 Your gradient is added to the Presets menu. Figure 2-8 shows an 
example of a unique gradient that we created in the Gradient Editor.

Adding transparency to a gradient
By default, a gradient has 100-percent opacity in the start color and progresses 
to 100-percent opacity in the end color. If you like, you can have the gradient 
fade out to transparency so that the portion of the image under the gradi-
ent shows through. To add transparency to a gradient, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Create a gradient, as described in the preceding section.
	
2.	 Select the left opacity stop.
	
	 This stop is located just above the gradient bar, as shown in Figure 2-9.
	
3.	 Use the Opacity slider to specify the amount of transparency for the 
gradient at its start point.
	
	 You can also type a value into the Opacity box.
	
4.	 Select the right opacity stop, and then slide the Opacity slider or enter 
a percentage in the text box to specify transparency for the gradient 
at its end point.
	
	 The lower the percentage, the less opaque the color.

5.	 Move the opacity stops to the right or left to adjust the location where 
Elements applies each stop’s opacity setting.
	
6.	 Move the midpoint slider (diamond icon) to adjust how the color and 
the transparency blend.
	
7.	 Click above the gradient bar to add more opacity stops if you want to 
vary the transparency of the gradient at different points.
	
	 For example, you could fade transparency from 100 percent to 50 per­
cent and back to 100 percent to produce a particular effect.
	
Gradients ordinarily proceed smoothly from one color to another. If you want 
a less-homogeneous appearance, adjust the Smoothness slider to a value of 
less than 100 percent (click the right-pointing arrow to access the slider).
Managing and Saving Gradients
After taking the time to create custom gradients, store them so that you can 
use or edit them again later. Before you save them, however, be sure to add 
them to the gradient presets. (See “Customizing and editing gradients” ear­
lier in this chapter.) Here are some tips for managing your gradients:
	
✓	To save your set of gradients, click the Save button in the Gradient 
Editor dialog box. You save the current presets, including your new gra­
dient, under the current library’s name or another one that you choose.
	
✓	To load gradient presets into the Gradient Editor, click the Load but­
ton and select the name of the gradient library that you want to add to 
the Presets list.
	
✓	To add to the current presets, select the name of the new presets from 
the Gradient Editor’s pop-up menu.
Working with Patterns
You may have spotted someone on the golf course with plaid shorts and a 
striped polo shirt. If so, you’ve been introduced to the power of patterns. 
Not always a pretty sight when used with abandon, patterns can be used to 
fill selections or layers. You can also stamp your image with the Pattern 
Stamp tool and retouch using a pattern with the Healing Brush tool. 
Elements offers a lot of preset patterns to keep you happy. But, you can cre­
ate your own, of course.
You select patterns from panels that appear on the Options bar for many of 
the tools just mentioned, just as you do with brush tips and gradients. You 
also manage them in much the same way using the Preset Manager. The fol­
lowing sections show you how to apply a preset pattern and create your own.

Working with Patterns
318
Applying a preset pattern
Although you can apply patterns by using many different tools, this chapter 
sticks with applying patterns as fills. To fill a layer or selection with a preset 
pattern, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose the layer from the Layers panel and/or make the selection you 
want to fill with a pattern.
	
	 We recommend making your selection on a new layer above the image 
for more flexible editing later on.
	
2.	 Choose Edit➪Fill Selection or Fill Layer, and select Pattern from the 
Use drop-down list, as shown in Figure 2-10.
	
3.	 Click the down-pointing arrow next to the Custom Pattern swatch and 
then from the Custom Pattern drop-down palette, select your desired 
pattern.
	
4.	 Choose any other fill options you want to apply, such as Mode, 
Opacity, or Preserve Transparency.
	
	 The Preserve Transparency option prevents Elements from filling the 
transparent areas on your layer with a pattern. Note that if you choose 
this option on a new, blank layer, nothing will be filled. For details on the 
other options, see the section “Filling a Selection with a Solid Color” ear­
lier in this chapter.
	
	 We recommend adjusting the Mode and Opacity settings in the Layers 
panel rather than in the Fill Layer dialog box. This approach allows you 
maximum flexibility if you want to make edits later.
	
5.	 Click OK to fill the layer or selection with the chosen pattern.
	
	 Here are a few other tips to remember when working with preset 
patterns:
	
•	 Replace the current patterns with new patterns by selecting Replace 
Patterns from the panel pop-up menu. (Click the right-pointing arrow 
on the right side of the panel.) Then, select the new pattern library 
from the dialog box that appears.
	
•	 Append new patterns to the current set by selecting Load Patterns 
from the panel pop-up menu.
	
•	 Append one of the preset libraries by selecting the library from the 
list at the bottom of the panel pop-up menu.

Creating a new pattern
You can create your own pattern, basing it on an existing image or one you 
create yourself. Select a small portion of an image to build an abstract pattern 
or use a recognizable object to define that object as a pattern stamp. You 
can use anything, from a logo to your signature, as a pattern.
To create your own pattern, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the image that contains the area you want to use as a pattern or 
create an image from scratch.
	
2.	 Make any modifications to the image to produce the exact pattern that 
you want.
	
3.	 Use the Rectangular Marquee tool to select the area you want to con­
vert into a pattern.
	
	 If you don’t make a selection, Elements uses your entire image as a basis 
for the pattern.
	
	 If you’re using a selection to define your pattern, you must use a rectan­
gular selection. And, you can’t use a feathered selection of any kind.

4.	 Choose Edit➪Define Pattern from Selection or Edit➪Define Pattern.
	
5.	 Enter a name for your pattern in the Pattern Name dialog box.
	
	 Your new pattern appears in the Pattern panel for use.
	
In addition to filling your selection with a pattern, you can stamp on a 
pattern with the Pattern Stamp tool. For details, see Book I, Chapter 2.

✓	Getting to know the Type tools and modes
✓	Entering and editing text
✓	Making type follow a path
✓	Editing text
✓	Rasterizing a Type layer
✓	Exploring masking, shaping, and warping effects
Yes, images are powerful. But so are words. In fact, humans tend to 
remember images better when they’re combined with words. This is 
why we don’t recall our dreams that well — no words are paired with the 
images. Enough psychobabble. You may never need to pick up a Type tool. 
But, just in case you need to add a caption, headline, or short paragraph, we 
want you to be comfortable using the Type tools.
Elements allows you to create, edit, stylize, and even distort type. 
Keep in mind that this capability is no substitute for a hard-core 
page-layout or word-processing program. But for small 
chunks of text here and there, it’s surprisingly effective. 
This chapter is all about adding great-looking snippets of 
text to great-looking images — an unbeatable combo.
Understanding Type Modes
The text you create in Elements can be categorized 
in several different ways, but ultimately, you’re 
either adding just a little text (such as a word or sin­
gle line) or a lot (a paragraph or so). Accordingly, 
Elements can create type in two modes:
	
✓	Point Type: Use this mode to create a headline or label. 
You can create point type by clicking in your image and typ­
ing; the line appears while you type and grows to whatever length you 
need. In fact, it even continues past the boundary of your image! Point 
type never wraps around to a new line. To wrap to the next line, you 
must press Enter (Return on the Mac).

Understanding Different Kinds of Type
322
	
✓	Paragraph Type: Use this mode to enter longer blocks of text on an 
image. It’s similar to the kind of type you’re accustomed to working with 
in word-processing programs. In Paragraph Type mode, all the text goes 
into a resizable bounding box, and if a line is too long, Photoshop auto­
matically wraps it around to the next line.
The Point Type and Paragraph Type modes each operate a bit differently, 
although they share many features and options. We explain each of them 
separately in the sections “Entering Point Type” and “Entering Paragraph 
Type,” later in this chapter.
Understanding Different Kinds of Type
In addition to the two Type modes Elements offers (see Point Type and 
Paragraph Type modes in the preceding section), Elements is also capable 
of displaying and printing type in two different formats. Each format has its 
pros and cons, and which format you use depends on your needs. Here’s a 
description of each one:
	
✓	Vector type: All text in Elements is initially created as vector type. 
Vector type provides scalable outlines that you can resize without pro­
ducing jagged edges in the diagonal strokes. You can edit type in this 
mode, adding or subtracting characters or adjusting attributes, such as 
kerning and tracking. Vector type is always of optimum quality and 
appears crisp and clean. (See Book III, Chapter 1 for more details on vec­
tor and rasterized images.)
	
✓	Raster type: When Elements converts vector type into pixels, that text is 
rasterized. Elements refers to this rasterization process as simplifying. 
When text is simplified, it’s no longer editable, but is converted into a 
raster image. In essence, it’s a frozen graphic of the text. You usually sim­
plify a vector type when you want to apply filters to produce a special effect 
or when you want to merge the type with the image. You can’t resize simpli­
fied type without losing some quality or risking jagged edges. For more 
details, see the section “Rasterizing the Type Layer,” later in this chapter.
Exploring the Type Tools
Elements has four Type tools (found in the Tools panel), but two of them are 
simply vertically oriented versions of the main two text implements, as 
shown in Figure 3-1. Don’t worry about the Vertical Type tools. Although you 
can use them, they’re really designed for the Asian market, to enter Chinese 
and Japanese characters. The Horizontal and Vertical Type tools are identi­
cal in their attributes, so we cover only the two Horizontal Type tools here, 
and for the sake of simplicity, we call them the Type tool and the Type Mask

tool. You can use either the Paragraph 
or Point Type mode with either of the 
Type tools:
	
✓	Type tool: Use this tool to enter 
point or paragraph type. This tool 
creates the type on its own type 
layer, except when used in Bitmap 
or Indexed Color modes, neither of 
which supports layers. For more on 
layers, see Book VI.
	
✓	Type Mask tool: This tool doesn’t create actual type; instead, it creates 
a selection border in the shape of the type you want to enter. The selec­
tion border is added to the active layer. You can do anything with a type 
selection that you can do with any other selection. For details on selec­
tions, see Book IV.
Entering Point Type
Most of the type you add to Elements will probably consist of point type. 
Point type is great for headlines, captions, labels, and similar small amounts 
of text. You can also use it to create logos and headings for Web pages. Point 
type is so called because it’s preceded by a single anchor point, which marks 
the starting point of the line of type. Remember that point-type lines don’t 
wrap automatically, as shown in Figure 3-2.
To enter point type, just follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open an image or create a new, blank 
document (or choose File➪New).
	
2.	 Select either the Type tool from the Tools panel or press the T key 
to select it, if it’s visible.
	
	 If the Type tool isn’t visible, press Shift+T to cycle through the type 
tools. Your cursor looks like an I-beam, similar to the one you see in a 
word-processing program.
	
3.	 Click the area of the image where you want to insert the text.
	
	 For horizontal type, a small horizontal line about one-third of the way 
up the I-beam shows the location of the baseline (on which the line of 
text rests).
	
4.	 Specify your type options from the Options bar.
	
	 All the options are described in the upcoming section, “Using the 
Options Bar.”
Figure 3-1: Elements offers four Type tools.

Entering Paragraph Type
324
	
5.	 Type your text 
and press Enter 
(or Return on the 
Mac) to begin a 
new line.
	
	 When you press 
Enter (or Return), you insert a hard return that doesn’t move. You have 
to remove hard returns if you want to change the length of the lines 
you type.
	
6.	 When you finish entering the text, click the Commit (the check 
mark icon) button on the Options bar.
	
	 You can also commit the type by pressing Enter on the numeric keypad 
or by clicking any other tool on the Tools panel. A new type layer con­
taining your text — indicated by the T icon — is created and appears in 
your Layers panel.
Entering Paragraph Type
If you have larger chunks of text, it’s more practical to enter the text as para­
graph type. Paragraph type is similar to the text you enter in a word-process­
ing program, except that it’s contained inside a text box or a bounding box. 
While you type into a text box, the lines of text wrap around to fit the dimen­
sions of the box. If you resize the box, Elements adjusts the wrapped ends to 
account for the new size.
You can type multiple paragraphs, use typographical controls, and rotate or 
scale the type. You can easily resize paragraph type (and point type, too) by 
entering a new point size value in the Options bar without having to reselect 
all the text. Just make sure the text layer is selected in the Layers panel and 
the Text tool is active. This approach works for all the other text character­
istics, as well.
To enter paragraph type, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open a saved image or create a new, blank Elements document in the 
Editor in Edit Full mode.
	
2.	 Select either the Type tool from the Tools panel or press the T key 
to select it, if it’s visible.
	
	 If it isn’t visible, press Shift+T to cycle through the Type tools.
	
	 Your cursor looks like an I-beam, similar to the one you see in a word-
processing program.

3.	 On the image, insert and size the text box by using one of the following 
methods:
	
•	 Drag to create a text box close to the size you want. After you release 
the mouse button, you can drag any of the handles at the corners 
and sides of the box to resize the box.
	
•	 Hold down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key and click the image. The 
Paragraph Text Size dialog box appears. Enter the exact dimensions 
of a bounding box. When you click OK, the specified box appears, 
complete with handles for resizing the box later.
	
4.	 Select Type options from the Options bar.
	
	 Options are described in detail in the upcoming section, “Using the 
Options Bar.”
	
5.	 Enter the text. To start a new paragraph, press Enter (Return on the Mac).
	
	 Each line wraps around to fit inside the bounding box, as shown in 
Figure 3-3.
	
	 If you type more 
text than fits in the 
text box, an over­
flow icon (plus 
sign) appears in 
the bottom-right 
handle. You can 
resize the text box 
by dragging any of 
the bounding box 
handles.
	
6.	 Click the Commit 
button (check mark 
icon) on the 
Options bar (or 
press Enter on the 
numeric keypad).
	
	 Elements creates a new type layer, as indicated by the T icon displayed 
in the Layers panel.
Using the Options Bar
Several character and paragraph type settings are located on the Options 
bar, as shown in Figure 3-4. These options enable you to specify the type and 
pair it with your images.
Figure 3-3: Paragraph text automatically wraps to conform to 
the bounding box.

Using the Options Bar
326
Figure 3-4: The Type options on the Options bar.
Here’s an explanation of each option, from left to right:
	
✓	Font Family: Select the font/typeface you want from the drop-down list. 
Elements provides you with a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) 
font menu. After the font name, the word sample is rendered in the 
actual font. You also find one of these abbreviations before the font 
name to let you know what type of font it is:
	
•	 a: Adobe Type 1 (PostScript) fonts
	
•	 TT: TrueType fonts
	
•	 O: OpenType fonts
	
	Fonts with no abbreviation are bitmapped fonts.
	
✓	Font Style: Some font families have additional styles, such as light or 
semibold. And other styles are assigned as separate typefaces. Only the 
styles available for a particular font appear in the list. The font style also 
supports a WYSIWYG menu.
	
	If a font you want to use doesn’t offer bold or italic styles, you can simu­
late either or both by selecting a faux style in the Options bar (T icons).
	
✓	Font Size: Select your type size from the drop-down list or just type a 
size in the text box. Generally, text sizes are shown in points, with 72 
points equaling approximately 1 inch.
	
	If you don’t like points, you can switch to millimeters or pixels by choos­
ing Edit➪Preferences➪Units and Rulers (or Elements➪Preferences➪
Units and Rulers on the Mac).
	
✓	Anti-aliased: Select Anti-aliased to slightly smooth out the edges of your 
text. Anti-aliasing softens that edge by 1 pixel, as shown in Figure 3-5. 
For the most part, you want to 
keep this option turned on. The 
one occasion when you may 
want it turned off is if you’re cre­
ating small type to be displayed 
onscreen, such as on Web 
pages. The soft edges can some­
times be tough to read easily.
	
✓	Faux Bold: Use this option to 
create a fake bold style when a 
real bold style (which you’d 
choose under Font Style) 
doesn’t exist. Be aware that

Working with Type
applying faux styles can distort the proportions of a font. You should try 
to use fonts with real styles, and if they don’t exist — oh, well.
	
✓	Faux Italic: This option creates a phony italic style and carries the same 
warning as the Faux Bold option.
	
✓	Underline: This setting obviously underlines your type, like this.
	
✓	Strikethrough: Choose this option to apply a strikethrough style to 
your text. In legal applications, strikethrough is widely used to show sec­
tions that have been removed, in their original context.
	
✓	Text Alignment: From the Text Alignment drop-down list, choose an 
option to align horizontal text on the left, center, or right. Left-aligned 
text is even with the left margin and allowed to be ragged on the right 
side of the column. Centered text is evenly centered in its column and 
ragged on both right and left edges. Right-aligned text is even with the 
right margin and allowed to be ragged on the left side.
	
	If you happen to have vertical text, these options rotate 90 degrees 
clockwise and change into top, bottom, and center vertical settings.
	
✓	Leading: Leading (pronounced “ledding”) is the amount of space 
between the baselines of lines of type, usually measured in points. The 
baseline is the imaginary line on which a line of type rests. You can 
select a specific amount of leading or allow Elements to determine the 
amount automatically by choosing Auto. When you select Auto Leading, 
Elements multiplies the type size by a value of 120 percent to calculate 
the leading size. Therefore, Elements spaces the baselines of 10-point 
type 12 points apart. Elements adds that extra 20 percent so that the 
bottoms of the lowest letters don’t “hook” onto the tops of the tallest let­
ters on the line below them.
	
	Wider line spacing can make text easier to read (as long as you don’t go 
overboard!) or can be used for artistic effect. Tighter line spacing makes 
for more-compact text but can decrease readability if the tightening 
goes too far.
	
✓	Text Color: Click the color swatch to select a color for your type from 
the Color Picker. You can also choose a color from the Swatches panel.
	
✓	Create Warped Text: This option lets you warp and bend text by using 
15 different types of distortion.
	
✓	Change the Text Orientation: Select your type layer in the Layers panel 
and then click this option to switch between vertical and horizontal type 
orientations.
	
✓	Cancel: Click this button (or press the Esc key) to cancel the text entry 
you’re making. Use this option or the Commit option only after you click 
the Type tool on your canvas.
	
✓	Commit: Click this button to apply the text to a type layer.

Editing Text
328
Editing Text
You can apply all the options described in this chapter while you enter text, 
or later, when you’re rearranging words or fixing typos and other errors. To 
make changes to the text itself, just follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open your image in the Editor in Edit Full mode.
	
2.	 Select the Type tool from the Tools panel.
	
3.	 In the Layers panel, select the existing type layer you want to modify. 
Or click within the text to automatically select the type layer.
	
	 Double-click the T icon in the Layers panel to simultaneously select all 
the text on that layer and activate your Type tool.
	
4.	 After selecting your desired text, use the Options bar to make your 
changes:
	
•	 Change the font family, size, color, or other type option: If you want to 
change all the text, simply select that type layer on the Layers panel. 
To select only portions of the text, highlight the text by dragging 
across it with the I-beam of the Type tool, as shown in Figure 3-6.
	
•	 Delete text: Highlight the text by dragging across it with the I-beam of 
the Type tool. Then press the Backspace key (Delete on the Mac).
	
•	 Add text: Make 
an insertion 
point by click­
ing the I-beam 
within the line 
of text. Then, 
type new text.
	
5.	 When you’re done modifying the text, click the Commit button.
	
Occasionally, you may want to transform your text. To do so, make sure 
that the type layer is selected on the Layers panel. Then, choose Image➪
Transform➪Free Transform. Grab a handle on the bounding box and drag to 
rotate or scale. Press Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) and drag a handle to distort. When 
you’re done, double-click inside the bounding box to commit the transforma­
tion. For more details on transformations, see Book VI, Chapter 2.
Rasterizing the Type Layer
The Type tool creates editable type layers. You can change the wording, 
spacing, font, font size, and other factors as much as you want as long as the 
type remains in a type layer, which retains the vector format. (See the section 
“Understanding Different Kinds of Type,” earlier in this chapter for details.)
Figure 3-6: Highlight selected text to modify attributes.

329
Book V
Chapter 3
Working with Type
However, after you make all the changes you want, you may need to convert 
your vector type layer to pixels in the form of rasterized type. In Elements, 
this rasterization process is referred to as simplifying. After the type is simpli­
fied, you can apply filters, paint on the type, and apply gradients and patterns.
If you’re working with layers and flatten your image (merge your layers into 
a single background image), the type layers are also simplified and merged 
with the other pixels in the image. By the way, if you try to apply a filter to a 
vector type layer, Elements barks at you that the type layer must be simpli­
fied before proceeding and gives you the opportunity to click OK (if you 
want to simplify) or Cancel.
To simplify your type, select the type layer on the Layers panel and choose 
Layer➪Simplify Layer. Your type layer 
is then converted (the T icon 
disappears) into a regular layer on 
which your type is now displayed as 
pixels against a transparent back­
ground, as shown in Figure 3-7.
	
After you simplify your type, you can 
no longer edit the type, nor can you 
resize the text without risking jaggies. 
Simplify your type only when you’re 
certain you won’t need to edit or resize 
it anymore. Another thing to remember 
about simplified type is that although it 
looks identical to vector type onscreen, 
it may not print as crisply and cleanly 
as vector type. So, if you’re experiment­
ing with painting or filters on type, just 
make a duplicate of the type layer 
before simplifying it and then hide that 
layer in the Layers panel. For details on 
working with layers, see Book VI.
Masking with Type
In addition to its Vertical and Horizontal Type tools that we’ve been discuss­
ing up to this point, Elements includes Vertical and Horizontal Type Mask 
tools. These tools function almost identically to their conventional counter­
parts, with one important exception: Type Mask tools don’t create a new 
layer. Instead, they create a selection on the active layer, like the one shown 
in Figure 3-8.

Figure 3-8: Type Mask tools create selection borders from the letter shapes.
You can treat the selections created with the Type Mask tools just as you 
would any other selection. Try the following:
	
✓	Move type mask selections around your document when any of the 
selection tools are active.
	
✓	Store type mask selections for later use by choosing Select➪Save 
Selection. See Book IV for details on selections.
	
✓	Use the selection to cut or copy portions of an image in text-shaped 
chunks, as shown in Figure 3-9. You can find out how this last technique 
works by following the steps in the Putting It Together project, “Carving 
Your Type out of Stone,” coming up next, in which you find out how to 
literally carve your words in stone.
	
✓	On a separate layer, fill the selection with a Foreground to Transparent 
gradient to have your type gradually fade out over the image, as shown 
in Figure 3-10. For details on gradients, see Book V, Chapter 2.

Carving Your Type out of Stone
You can use a Type tool to create selections shaped like text and then use images them­
selves as fills for the type. For example, if you’re creating a floral-themed Web page, you 
can use pictures of flowers as the fill for the text. A type selection can cut out any part of 
a picture for use in any way you want.
Follow these steps to create letters made from stone:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open the stone texture image you want to use.
	
	 We’re using a sandstone wall, but you can use other kinds of stone, wood, or any 
texture that interests you.
	
2.	 Convert your background into a layer by double-clicking the word Background on 
the Layers panel and then click OK.
	
	 This step enables you to stylize the type later.

Stylizing and Warping Type
You can do a lot more with type than create conventional labels, captions, 
or paragraphs of text. Type can become an interesting part of your image, 
especially when you stylize, warp, or otherwise transform it in interesting 
ways. Your Elements text can help enhance the impact of your image. The 
text of a beach scene can appear to be wavy, or watery and translucent. 
Halloween type can take on a ghostly or spooky appearance. Text on a wed­
ding photo can be elegant and romantic. It all depends on how you create 
and apply various effects.
The following sections show you some of the tricks you can perform by styl­
izing and warping your type so that your words come to life and add some­
thing special to your images.
	
9.	 Select the Bevels styles library from the drop-down list in the upper-right area of 
the Effects panel. Double-click the desired bevel.
	
10.	 Select the Drop Shadow styles library from the drop-down list in the upper-right 
area of the Effects panel. Double-click the desired shadow.
	
	 We selected a Simple Inner bevel and Soft Edge drop shadow to produce our stone 
letters, as shown in the figure.
	
	 To get all the details on how to use the other options in the Layer Style dialog box, 
check out Book VII, Chapter 3.
	
	 If you want to admire your type against a solid background, create a new layer and 
then choose Edit➪Fill Layer and choose a color from the Use drop-down list.

Playing with type opacity
Layers are a digital version of the old analog transparency, or acetate, sheets. 
(Check out Book VI, Chapter 1 for the scoop on layers.) You can change the 
transparency of a Type layer — just as you can with any other layer in 
Elements — by reducing the opacity (transparency) of the type so that it 
enables the underlying layer to show through. Take a peek at Figure 3-11, 
which shows type at varying levels of opacity over an image.
The upcoming Putting It Together project, “Ghosting Your Type,” shows you 
a way to use type opacity to create a ghostly effect.

Working with Type
type to an existing picture or background. Just for the heck of it, these steps show you 
how to add ghostly writing to an existing image:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open the image you want to use as a background for 
the ghost type.
	
	 Any image, ectoplasmic or not, will do. We chose a jack-o’-lantern, as shown in the 
figure.
	
2.	 Click the Foreground color swatch in 
the Tools panel and select the color you 
want to use for your text from the Color 
Picker.
	
	 For info on using the Color Picker, see 
Book III, Chapter 4. Black and orange 
are good Halloween colors, but you can 
use any contrasting colors.
	
	 You can also sample a color directly 
from your image by using the 
Eyedropper tool. Simply click your 
desired color and it then becomes your 
new foreground color.
	
3.	 Select the Horizontal Type tool from the 
Tools panel and then click the area 
where you want to add the text.
	
	 The vertical cursor that appears is the 
size that the text will be.
	
4.	 Select a font, style, and size from the 
drop-down lists on the Options bar, as 
shown in the figure.
	
5.	 Check the Anti-aliasing option on the Options bar to help smooth the edges of your 
type.
	
6.	 Type your text.
	
	 The text appears on top of the background.
	
7.	 Click the Commit button (the check mark icon) on the Options bar to insert the text 
you’ve typed into a layer of its own.
	
8.	 To change the opacity of the type, adjust the Opacity setting of the Type layer in the 
Layers panel.

	 To make additional changes to the text, you can apply a filter. For example, if you 
want to make the text wavy, select the Wave filter in the Filter➪Distort menu. Or you 
can use other filters from the array discussed in Book VII, Chapter 1. Just remem­
ber, when you use a filter, a warning pops up informing you that the type layer must 
be simplified (converted from editable text to pixels) first. Click OK and then apply 
the filter.

Working with Type
Applying filters to type
One of the most interesting things you can do with type in Elements that you 
can’t do in a word-processing or page-layout program is apply special effects, 
such as filters. You can make type look as if it’s underwater or on the move, as 
shown in Figure 3-12, where we applied a motion blur. The only caveat is that 
type has to be simplified before a filter can be applied. Be sure to do all your 
text-editing before you get to the filtering stage. Applying the filter is as easy 
as selecting the simplified type layer on the Layers panel and choosing a filter 
from the Filter menu. For more on filters, see Book VII, Chapter 1.

Figure 3-12: Applying a motion blur to type can make it appear as fast as the skaters.
Painting over type with color
Changing the color of text is as easy as highlighting it and selecting a color 
from the Color Picker. But what if you want to do something a little more 
unconventional, such as apply brush strokes of paint randomly across the 
type, as we did in the first image shown in Figure 3-13? It’s really easier than it 
looks. Again, as with applying filters to text, the only criterion is that the type 
has to be simplified first. After that’s done, select a color, grab the Brush tool 
with settings of your choice, and paint. In our example, we used a rough, dry 
brush found in the Brushes presets. We used a diameter of 39, 15, and 6 pixels 
and just clicked the type a few times.

Stylizing and Warping Type
338
	
If you want the color or gradient to be 
confined to only the type area, you can 
select the text by either Ctrl-clicking 
(Ô-clicking on the Mac) the layer con­
taining the text or locking the transpar­
ency of the layer on the Layers panel.
You can also apply a gradient to your 
type. Here are the steps to follow after 
simplifying your type:
	
1.	 In the Editor in Edit Full mode, 
select the Gradient tool from the 
Tools panel.
	
2.	 On the Options bar, click the 
down-pointing arrow next to the 
Gradient Picker to access the Gradient Picker drop-down panel.
	
3.	 Choose a gradient.
	
	 If you want to create a custom gradient, find out how in Book V, Chapter 2.
	
4.	 Position the gradient cursor on the text where you want the gradient 
to start and drag to where you want the gradient to end.
	
	 If you’re not happy, drag again until you get the look you want. 
Remember that you can drag at any angle and to any length, even out­
side your type. In the second image shown in Figure 3-13, we used the 
copper gradient and just dragged from the top of the letters to the bot­
tom. We also locked the transparent pixels on the layer to confine the 
gradient to just the type area.
Warping your type
Elements’s great automated Warp feature can twist your type in a variety of 
ways (see Figure 3-14) that are not only repeatable but, thanks to the con­
trols in their dialog boxes, also customizable. The cool part is that even 
though type has been warped, it remains fully editable until you simplify it.
Type-warping is fun and easy to do. Select the Type tool in the Tools panel 
and then click the Create Warped Text button at the far-right end of the 
Options bar. (It’s the T with a curved line below it.) This action opens the 
Warp Text dialog box, where you find a vast array of distortions on the Style 
pop-up menu with descriptive names such as Bulge, Inflate, and Squeeze. 
Figure 3-13: Add visual interest to type with 
color (top) or a gradient (bottom).

Chapter 3
Working with Type
You can adjust the orientation, amount of bend, and degree of distortion by 
dragging the sliders. The Bend setting affects the amount of warp, and the 
Horizontal and Vertical Distortions apply perspective to that warp. Luckily, 
you can preview the results while you adjust. We could give you technical 
explanations of these adjustments, but the best way to see what they do is 
to just play with them. Figure 3-14 shows some of the warp styles. The 
names speak for themselves.

Working with 
Layers and Masks

A
fter you master creating selections, you’ll 
want to do something with the selections 
you create. This is where Book VI helps you. We 
talk about creating selection masks, reusing selec­
tions, adding layers to a document, and creating 
layers from selections, and all the masking options 
you have in Edit Full mode. Next to mastering 
selections, understanding layers and how to use 
them is one of the most important aspects of 
working in Elements.

✓	Compositing with multiple layers
✓	Transforming layers
✓	Simplifying layers
U
sing Elements without the assistance of layers would be like trying to 
wash your car with a toothbrush and a pail of water instead of with a 
hose and a power-scrubber brush. Yes, it can be done. But it takes a lot lon­
ger and is downright tedious. The benefit to using layers is that you have 
tremendous flexibility. You can make endless edits as long as those layers 
exist. You can rearrange their order, and if you decide you don’t want them 
anymore, you simply delete them. Layers make working in Elements a lot 
more forgiving, allowing you to make changes quickly and 
productively.
But hey, it’s not just the technical and practical aspects 
that make layers so awesome. Layers also allow you to 
express your creative side: You can composite sev­
eral images into one with just a drag of the mouse, 
for example. This chapter gives you the basics on 
working with layers. Chapter 2 of this minibook fills 
in the rest of the details. After you give layers a try, 
you’ll find that they make your image-editing life so 
much easier. Now, if only they would go out and 
wash the car.
Getting Familiar with Layers
In terms of a real-world analogy, think of layers as sheets of acetate 
or transparency film, similar to those clear plastic sheets used with 
overhead projectors. You have drawings, photos, or type on the individual 
sheets. What you place on one sheet doesn’t affect the other sheets. You 
can show just one sheet, or you can stack several on top of one another to 

Getting Familiar with Layers

create a combination image, or composite (or collage). You can reshuffle the 
order of the sheets, add sheets, or delete sheets. Any space on the sheet 
that doesn’t have an image, a drawing, or some type on it is transparent.
That’s how layers work in Elements. You can place elements on separate lay­
ers yet show them together to create a composite. You can also add, delete, 
or rearrange layers. And, unlike using real sheets of acetate, you can adjust 
an element’s opacity, or how opaque or transparent it is on the layer. You 
can also change the way the colors between layers interact by using Blend 
modes. Both opacity and Blend modes are covered in Chapter 3 of this 
minibook.
When you create a new image with a white or colored background, scan an 
image into Elements, or open a file from a CD or your digital camera, you 
basically have a file with just a background. You have no layers yet.
At this basic level, an image contains only the single background, and you 
can’t do much to it besides paint on it and make basic adjustments. You can’t 
rearrange the background in the stack of layers (after you have some) — it’s 
always on the bottom of the Layers panel. You also can’t change the opacity 
or Blend mode of a background. What you can do is convert a background to 
a layer, making it possible to shuffle, change the opacity, and change the 
Blend modes of your newly formed layer.
	
Keep in mind that to work with layers, you must be in the Editor in Edit 
Full mode.
To convert a background into a layer, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, choose Window➪Layers to display the 
Layers panel.
	
	 The Layers panel is explained in the upcoming section “Getting to Know 
the Layers Panel.”
	
2.	 Double-click Background in the Layers panel.
	
	 You can also choose Layer➪New➪Layer from Background. Note that the 
name Background is italicized in the Layers panel, as shown in Figure 1-1.
	
	 The New Layer dialog box appears.
	
3.	 Name the layer or leave it at the default name of Layer 0.
	
	 Note that you can also adjust the Blend mode and opacity of the layer in 
the New Layer dialog box. You should do so by using the Layers panel 
commands. We cover these techniques in Chapter 3 of this minibook.

4.	 Click OK.
	
	 Elements converts your background into a layer, also known as an image 
layer. Note that the layer name is no longer italicized nor is it locked, as 
shown in Figure 1-2.
	
	 When you create a new image with 
transparent content for the back­
ground, the image doesn’t contain 
a background but instead is created 
with a single layer. If you so desire, 
you can convert a layer into a 
background by selecting it and 
then choosing Layer➪New➪
Background from Layer. Note that 
this option is available only when 
no background exists.
Introducing Different Types of Layers
Although turning the background into a layer (discussed in the preceding 
section) is a popular activity, Elements refers to plural layers for a reason. 
You’ll probably create image layers most of the time, but other types exist. 
Elements offers five types of layers. Some you may never use, and some you 
may use only occasionally, but you should be familiar with them all.
Figure 1-2: Double-click the background to 
convert it into a layer.

Introducing Different Types of Layers
346
Working with image layers
The image layer is the one that most closely matches the acetate analogy 
(discussed in the section “Getting Familiar with Layers,” earlier in this chap­
ter). You put various elements on separate layers to create a composite 
image. You can create blank layers and add images to them, or you can cre­
ate layers from images themselves. You can create as many layers as your 
computer’s memory allows.
Because each layer in an image is a separate entity, you can edit, paint, 
transform, mask (described in Chapter 4 of this minibook), or apply a filter 
to a layer without affecting the other layers or the background. And, after an 
element is on a layer, you no longer have to make a selection to select it. 
(See Book IV for details on selections.) Just drag the element with the Move 
tool. The element freely floats in a sea of transparency.
	
Because showing clear areas, or transparency, is impossible on a computer 
monitor, Elements uses a gray-and-white checkerboard by default to repre­
sent the transparent areas of a layer.
Using adjustment layers
An adjustment layer is a special kind of layer used mostly for color and con­
trast correction. What’s helpful about adjustment layers is that you can 
apply those corrections without permanently affecting any pixels on your 
layers. Adjustment layers are totally nondestructive. They apply the correc­
tion to all layers below them, without affecting any layers above them.
Because the adjustment resides on a layer, you can edit, delete, duplicate, 
merge, or rearrange the adjustment layer at any time. You have more flexibil­
ity in your image-editing chores and more freedom for experimentation. In 
addition, none of this experimentation harms your image because it takes 
place above the image on an adjustment layer.
	
Another unique feature of adjustment layers is that when you create one, 
you also create a layer mask on that layer. A layer mask is like a second sheet 
of acetate that hovers over the underlying layers. You use the layer mask to 
selectively apply the adjustment to the layers below it by applying shades of 
gray — from white to black — on the mask. For example, because the mask is, 
by default, completely white, you can fully apply the adjustment to the layers. 
If you paint on a layer mask with black, as shown in Figure 1-3, the areas 
under those black areas don’t show the adjustment. If you paint with a shade 
of gray, those areas partially show the adjustment. The darker the shade of 
gray, the less these areas show the adjustment. Note that if your image has 
an active selection border in it before you add an adjustment layer, the 
adjustment is applied to only the area within the selection border. The 

347
Book VI 
Chapter 1
Creating Layers
Introducing Different Types of Layers
347
resulting layer mask also reflects that 
selection: The selected areas are white, 
and the unselected areas are black.
You can also use the layer mask to cre­
atively blend two layers. Be sure to see 
Chapter 4 of this minibook to find out 
how. It’s definitely worth your while.
Elements has eight kinds of adjustment 
layers, and you can use as many as 
your heart desires. The adjustments 
offered are the same ones you find on 
the Enhance➪Adjust Lighting and 
Enhance➪Adjust Color submenus. For specifics on each adjustment and 
what it corrects, see Book VIII, Chapters 1 and 2. Here’s how to create an 
adjustment layer:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open an image of your choice.
	
	 Because you’re applying an adjustment layer, you may want to use an 
image that’s in need of some color adjustment. Note that with adjust­
ment layers, you don’t need to convert your background into a layer.
	
2.	 Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon in the Layers panel.
	
	 The Adjustment Layer drop-down list appears.
	
	 Note that you can also choose Layer➪New Adjustment Layer and then 
choose an adjustment layer from the submenu. Name the layer, leave 
the other options at their defaults, and click OK.
	
3.	 From the drop-down list, choose an adjustment.
	
	 The dialog box pertaining to your adjustment appears in the new 
Adjustments panel.
	
4.	 Make the necessary adjustments in the Adjustments panel.
	
	 The adjustment layer appears in the Layers panel, shown in Figure 1-4. 
The Adjustment Layer icon (sporting a few gears) and a thumbnail (rep­
resenting a layer mask) appear on the adjustment layer.
	
In our example, the layer mask of the Levels adjustment layer — the central 
layer of the three-layer sandwich — is all white, so the adjustment shows up 
full strength over the image. Note that you can paint on the layer mask to 
selectively allow only portions of your image to receive the adjustment, as 
shown in our Hue/Saturation adjustment layer. Use the Brush or Pencil tool 
to paint. Or, you can also make a selection and fill it with any shade of gray, 
Figure 1-3: Layer masks are added by 
creating an adjustment layer.

348
from white to black. Finally, you can use the Gradient tool on the mask to 
create a gradual application of the adjustment.
You can also adjust the opacity and Blend modes of an adjustment layer, 
just as with image layers. Reducing the opacity of an adjustment layer 
reduces the effect of the adjustment on the underlying layers.
Viewing and deleting adjustment layers
	
If you want to view your image without the adjustment, click the Eye icon in 
the left column of the Layers panel to hide the adjustment layer. If you want 
to delete the adjustment layer, simply drag it to the Trash icon in the Layers 
panel or choose Delete➪Layer from the Layer menu or the Layers panel options 
menu. (Click More in the top-right corner of the panel to access the menu.)
Editing adjustment layers
After you create an adjustment layer, you can easily edit it. Simply double-
click the Adjustment Layer icon in the Layers panel. You can also choose 
Layer➪Layer Content Options. In the adjustment’s dialog box, make any 
edits and then click OK. The only adjustment layer that you can’t edit is the 
Invert adjustment layer. It’s either totally on or totally off.

Using the adjustments panel controls
	
Click an icon. From left to right, here’s what the icons do: 
	
✓	Have the adjustment layer clip to the layer below it (affects only the 
layer directly beneath it, not all underlying layers in the stack)
	
✓	Toggle the adjustment layer on and off
	
✓	View the previous state (how the image appeared before your most-
recent step)
	
✓	Reset the adjustment layer settings to their defaults
Isolating your adjustments
If you don’t use an adjustment layer when you make color corrections, the 
correction you apply affects only the active layer (the layer highlighted in 
the Layers panel). The correction doesn’t affect all layers below it, as it 
would if you used an adjustment layer. But you can also isolate the adjust­
ment layer to a single layer or a portion of a single layer.
Here are some tips for using and isolating adjustment layers:
	
✓	Correct part (but not all) of a layer. To enable the adjustment layer to 
correct only a portion of a layer, make a selection before you create the 
adjustment layer. The adjustment affects only the pixels within the 
selection outline. The adjustment affects the pixels within the selection 
outline on each layer that resides below the adjustment layer.
	
	Another way to correct part of a layer is to paint on the adjustment layer 
mask. Painting with black hides the adjustment, and painting with various 
levels of gray partially hides the adjustment. For more on masks, see 
Chapter 4 of this minibook.
	
✓	Clip to the layer. If you want the adjustment layer to affect only the 
immediate underlying layer and not those below that immediate layer, 
you can create a clipping group. To do so, press the Alt key (Option on 
the Mac) and click the line between the adjustment layer and your 
immediate, underlying image layer. For details on clipping groups, see 
Chapter 4 of this minibook.
Taking advantage of fill layers
A fill layer lets you add a layer of solid color, a gradient, or a pattern. Like 
adjustment layers, fill layers also have layer masks, as indicated by the Mask 
icon thumbnail in the Layers panel.

Introducing Different Types of Layers
350
Just as with image layers and adjustment layers, you can create as many fill 
layers as you want. You can also edit, rearrange, duplicate, delete, and merge 
fill layers. And, you can blend fill layers with other layers by using the 
opacity and Blend mode options in the Layers panel.
	
You can confine the effects of a fill layer, as you can with an adjustment layer, 
to a portion of the image. Make a selection before you create the fill layer 
(see Book IV for more on selections) or paint on the mask later (described in the 
earlier section “Isolating your adjustments”). Editing a fill layer is similar to 
editing an adjustment layer. To edit a fill layer, double-click the Fill Layer 
thumbnail in the Layers panel.
Here’s how to create a fill layer:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open an image of your choice.
	
	 In this case, open an image that would look good with a frame or border 
or even some type. Note that if you don’t have an active selection, the 
fill layer encompasses your entire layer.
	
2.	 Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon on the Layers panel. From the 
drop-down list, choose a fill of a solid color, gradient, or pattern.
	
	 Note that you can also choose Layer➪New Fill Layer and then choose a 
fill layer from the submenu. In the New Layer dialog box, name the layer, 
leave the other options at their defaults, and click OK. Specify options 
such as Mode and Opacity within your Layers panel, where you have 
more editing flexibility.
	
	 The dialog box specific to your type of fill appears.
	
3.	 Specify your options, depending on the fill type you chose in Step 2:
	
•	 Solid Color: Select a color from the Color Picker. (For more on color, 
see Book III, Chapter 4.)
	
•	 Gradient: Click the down-pointing arrow to choose a preset gradient 
from the drop-down panel or click the Gradient preview to display 
the Gradient Editor and create your own gradient. For details on gra­
dients, see Book V, Chapter 2.
	
•	 Pattern: Select a pattern from the drop-down panel, as shown in 
Figure 1-5. Choose a value from the Scale drop-down list, if you want. 
Click Snap to Origin to make the origin of the pattern the same as the 
origin of the document. Select the Link with Layer option to specify 
that the pattern moves with the fill layer if you move the layer.
	
4.	 Click OK.
	
	 The fill layer appears in the Layers panel. Similar to what happens in 
adjustment layers, a layer mask is created on the fill layer. In our exam­
ple, in Figure 1-6, the words Dolphin Sanctuary appear in white on the 
layer mask, thereby allowing our pattern to show through. The 

351

remaining areas are black, hiding our pattern. We also added some layer 
styles (bevel and drop shadow) to jazz up our type. For more on 
layer styles, see Book VII, Chapter 3.
Figure 1-5: Choose from a variety of preset patterns for your fill layer.
	
	 If you want to delete the fill layer, first select the layer in the Layers 
panel; then either drag it to the Trash icon in the Layers panel, choose 
Delete➪Layer from the Layer menu, or choose Delete Layer from the 
Layers panel options menu.

You can simplify a fill layer to convert it to a regular image layer. Choose 
Layer➪Simplify. By doing so, you can use painting tools or filters on that layer. 
For more on simplifying layers, see Chapter 2 of this minibook.
Making use of shape layers
Believe or not, Elements isn’t just about photos and painting. It also has a set 
of shape-drawing tools — six, to be exact. You can fill those shapes with solid 
color, gradients, or patterns. When you create a shape, you’re creating a vector-
based object: This term means that the shapes are defined by mathematical 
equations, which create points and paths, rather than by pixels. The advantage 
of using vector-based objects is that you can freely size these objects without 
causing degradation. In addition, they’re always printed with smooth edges, not 
with the jaggies you’re familiar with seeing in pixel-based elements.
To create a shape layer, grab a shape tool from the Tools panel and drag it 
on your canvas. When you create a shape, it resides on its own, unique 
shape layer, as shown in Figure 1-7. Although you can move and transform 
shapes and adjust the Blend modes and opacity, your ability to edit shape 
layers is limited. To apply filters and other special effects, you must first sim­
plify the shape layers — that is, convert the vector paths to pixels. For more 
on shapes, see Book V, Chapter 1.
Using type layers
To create type, such as the type shown in Figure 1-8, click your canvas with 
the Type tool and type some text. After you commit your text by pressing 
Enter on the numeric keypad or clicking the Commit button (the check mark 
icon) on the Options bar, you’ve created a type layer. In the Layers panel, 
you see a layer with a T icon, indicating that it’s a type layer. Initially, the 
name of the type layer corresponds to the text you typed (you can change 
the layer name, if you want). Like shapes, the text in Elements is vector-
based type and, if left in that format, always prints smoothly and without the 
jaggies. For more information on vector images, see Book III, Chapter 1.
Another great thing about type in Elements is that it’s live: You can edit the 
text at any time. Besides being able to change the font and size, you can 
change the orientation, apply anti-aliasing (softening of the edges), and even 
warp it into various distortions. You can transform, move, rearrange, copy, 
and change the layer options (opacity, fill, and mode) of a type layer just as 
you can for image layers. If, however, you want to apply filters, you must 
first simplify (convert into pixels) the text. For everything you need to know 
about type, see Book V, Chapter 3.

Getting to Know the Layers Panel
354
Getting to Know the Layers Panel
Just like every other important aspect of Elements, layers are controlled in 
their very own panel. You might have seen bits and pieces of the Layers 
panel throughout this chapter, but now it’s time for a full-blown discussion 
of its capabilities. To display the Layers panel, shown in Figure 1-9, choose 
Window➪Layers in the Editor, in Edit Full mode.
The order of the layers in the Layers panel represents the order in the 
image. We refer to this concept as the stacking order. The top layer in 
the panel is the top layer in your image, and so on.
For some tasks, you can work on only one layer at a time. For other tasks, 
you can work on multiple layers simultaneously.
Here’s the lowdown on how to work with the Layers panel:
	
✓	Select a layer. Click a layer name or thumbnail. Elements then highlights 
the active layer in the panel.
	
✓	Select multiple contiguous layers. Click your first layer and then Shift-
click your last layer.

✓	Select multiple noncontiguous layers. Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) 
some layers.
	
	Only layers that are visible are printed. This can be useful if you want to 
have several versions of an image (each on a separate layer) for a project 
within the same file.
	
✓	Select the actual element (the nontransparent pixels) on the layer. 
Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) the layer’s thumbnail in the panel.
	
✓	Create a new, blank layer. Click the Create New Layer icon (a dog-eared 
page) at the top of the panel.
	
✓	Create an adjustment or fill layer. Click the Create New Fill or 
Adjustment Layer icon (the black-and-white circle) at the top of the 
panel. See the earlier sections “Using adjustment layers” and “Taking 
advantage of fill layers” for more on these types of layers.
	
✓	Duplicate an existing layer. Drag the layer to the Create a New Layer 
icon at the top of the panel.
	
✓	Rename a layer. When you create a new layer, Elements provides 
default layer names (Layer 1, Layer 2, and so on). To rename a layer, 
double-click the layer name (the name, not the thumbnail) in the Layers 
panel, enter the name directly in the Layers panel, and press Enter 
(Return on the Mac). Although it may seem tedious to give your layers 
meaningful names, it can increase your productivity, especially when 
the number of layers in your file starts to increase.
	
✓	Adjust the interaction between colors on layers and adjust the trans­
parency of layers. You can use the Blend modes and the Opacity drop-
down menus at the top of the panel to mix the colors between layers 
and adjust the transparency of the layers. (Take a look at Figure 1-10, 
where we set the opacity at 30% and chose Lighten from the Blend mode 
drop-down menu.) For details, see Chapter 3 of this minibook.
	
✓	Delete a layer. Drag it to the Trash icon at the bottom of the Layers 
panel. You can also choose Layer➪Delete➪Layer or choose Delete Layer 
from the panel options menu.
You use the remaining icons at the top of the Layers panel to link layers and 
lock layers. Both actions warrant sections of their own. In addition, you can 
view, hide, rearrange, merge, and flatten layers. See Chapter 2 of this mini­
book for more details on all these features.

Using the Layer and Select Menus

Using the Layer and Select Menus
As with many features in Elements, you usually have more than one way to 
do something, especially when it comes to working with layers. Besides the 
commands on the Layers panel itself, you have two layer menus — the Layer 
menu and the Select menu — both of which you can find on the main Menu 
bar at the top of the Application window or at the top of the screen on a Mac.
The Layer menu
Much of what you can do with the Layers panel icons, you can also do by 
using the Layer menu on the Menu bar and the Layers panel pop-up menu. 
(Click the down-pointing arrow in the upper-right corner to call up that one.) 
Commands such as New, Duplicate, Delete, and Rename are omnipresent 
throughout. But you also find commands that are exclusive to the panel, the 
main Layer menu, and the Layers pop-up menu. So, if you can’t find what 
you’re looking for in one area, just go to another. Some commands require 
an expanded explanation and are described in other sections of this and 
other minibooks. Here’s a quick description of most of the commands:
	
✓	Delete Linked Layers and Delete Hidden Layers: These commands 
delete only those layers that have been linked or hidden from display on 
the Layers panel.

357
Book VI 
Chapter 1
Creating Layers
Using the Layer and Select Menus
357
	
✓	Layer Style: These commands manage the styles or special effects you 
apply to your layers. Find more on layer styles and effects in Book VII, 
Chapter 3.
	
✓	Arrange: You use this command to shuffle the layer-stacking order. See 
Chapter 2 of this minibook for more on this topic.
	
✓	Group with Previous and Ungroup: The Group command creates a 
clipping group, in which a group of layers is constrained to the boundaries 
of a base layer. Find more details in Chapter 4 of this minibook.
	
✓	Type: The commands on the Type submenu control the display of type 
layers. For more on type, see Book V, Chapter 3.
	
✓	Rename Layer: You use this option to give a layer a new name. You can 
also simply double-click the name on the Layers panel.
	
✓	Simplify: This command converts a type layer, shape layer, or fill layer 
into a regular image layer. In other words, it converts vector-based type 
and images to pixel-based type and images. See Chapter 2 of this mini­
book for details.
	
✓	Merge and Flatten: The various Merge and Flatten commands combine 
multiple layers into a single layer or, in the case of flattening, combine 
all layers into a single background. See Chapter 2 of this minibook for 
more info.
	
✓	Palette Options: Choose Palette Options from the Layers panel menu 
and select a thumbnail size. You can also choose whether to display just 
the boundary of the layer contents or the whole document in the 
thumbnail.
The Select menu
Although the Select menu’s main duties are to assist you in making and refin­
ing your selections, it offers a few handy layer commands. Here’s a quick 
introduction to each command:
	
✓	Select All Layers: Want to quickly get everything in your file? Choose 
Select➪All Layers. Note that this command doesn’t select the 
background.
	
✓	Select Layers of Similar Type: This command is helpful if you have dif­
ferent types of layers in your document — such as regular layers, type 
layers, shape layers, and adjustment layers — and you want to select 
just one type. Select a layer and then choose Select➪Similar Layers.
	
✓	Deselect All Layers: Choose Select➪Deselect Layers.

Making Layers
358
Making Layers
Good old-fashioned image layers are the backbone of the world of layers. 
You can create multiple image layers within a single document. Even more 
fun is creating a composite from several different images. The creative possi­
bilities are endless. The following sections take a look at the various ways to 
create these layers.
Creating a new layer
You can create a layer in a new file or an existing one. To go the new-file 
route, choose File➪New in the Editor, in Edit Full mode. Then, in the New 
dialog box that appears, select Transparent for the Background Contents 
option. (Note: Your new file appears labeled as Layer 1 rather than as 
Background.)
If you have an open image and you want to create a new, blank layer, here’s 
how to do so:
	
✓	In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, click the Create New Layer icon at the 
top of the Layers panel. A layer with the default name Layer 1 appears in 
the Layers panel.
	
✓	In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, select New Layer from the Layers panel 
pop-up menu (located under More in the top-right area of the panel).
	
✓	Choose Layer➪New➪Layer.
	
	If you create a layer by using either of the preceding menu commands, 
you open a dialog box in which you name your layer and can specify 
other options for blending and opacity. Provide a name for your layer 
and click OK. You should specify the other options directly in the Layers 
panel later.
After your new transparent layer is ready to go, you can put content on the 
new layer in one of several ways:
	
✓	Use one of the painting tools, such as the Brush or Pencil, and paint 
directly on the layer.
	
✓	Make a selection on another layer or on the background within the same 
document or from another image entirely. Then choose Edit➪Copy. 
Select your new, blank layer in the Layers panel and choose Edit➪Paste.
	
✓	Make a selection on another layer (or on the background) within the 
same document or from another image and then choose Edit➪Cut. 
Select a new, blank layer and choose Edit➪Paste. Just remember that 
Elements deletes the selection from the source and adds it to your new 
layer, as shown in Figure 1-11.

✓	Transfer an entire image to your new layer by choosing Select➪All and

choose Edit➪Paste.

Figure 1-11: Cutting and pasting a selection from one layer to another 
	
leaves a transparent hole on the original layer.
Using Layer via Copy and Layer via Cut
Another way to create a layer is to use the Layer via Copy command on the 
Layer menu. Make a selection on a layer or background and choose Layer➪
New➪Layer via Copy. The copied selection is placed on a new layer with the 
default name Layer 1. You can do the same with the Layer via Cut command, 
but in this case Elements cuts, or deletes, the selected area from the source 
layer or background and places it on the new layer. The source layer is left 
with a gaping, transparent, or background-colored hole (refer to Figure 1-11). 
Remember that you can use these two commands only within the same 
image. You can’t use them between images.
Duplicating layers
If you want to duplicate an existing layer, first select it in the Layers panel. 
Then drag the layer to the Create New Layer icon at the top of the Layers 
panel. You can also duplicate a layer by selecting Duplicate Layer from the 
Layers panel pop-up menu or by choosing Layer➪Duplicate Layer. As when 
you create a new layer, both menu methods prompt you with a dialog box to 
name your layer and specify other options. Provide a name for your layer 
and click OK. If you chose the first method, Elements provides the default 
name of the original layer with the word Copy appended to the name.

Compositing with Multiple Images
360
	
Duplicating layers can be especially handy when you want to experiment 
with a special effect but don’t want to harm your original image.
Compositing with Multiple Images
Often, when working with layers, you’re not using just a single image. Face it: 
You can only do so much to that family portrait taken down at the local 
photo studio. But pluck your family out of that stale studio and put them in 
front of the ruins at Pompeii or the summit at K2 and you have endless 
hours of fun. When you get the hang of working with several images, you find 
that it opens up a whole new realm of creative possibilities. And, you’re not 
limited to snapshots. You can incorporate type, shapes, and scans of just 
about anything you can place on a scanning bed. Apply some effects, maybe 
a filter or two, and you have an image worthy of some major wall real estate.
Copying and pasting images
In the “Making Layers” section, earlier in this chapter, we explain how to use 
the Copy, Cut, and Paste commands within the same image or between two 
different images when you want to fill a new, blank layer with content. You 
can also use the Copy and Paste commands without having a blank layer 
ready. When you copy and paste a selection without a blank layer, Elements 
automatically creates a new layer from the pasted selection. You can go on 
your merry way and perform all your layer creations by using only those 
commands. However, we rarely use them when working with multiple 
images. We prefer the drag-and-drop method, which we describe in the fol­
lowing section.
	
The Copy Merged command on the Edit menu creates a merged, or joined, 
copy of all visible layers within the selection.
Dragging and dropping layers
Follow these steps to drag and drop layers from one file to another:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open two or more images.
	
2.	 In one of your images, select a layer in the Layers panel.
	
3.	 Grab the Move tool (the four-headed arrow) from the Tools panel.
	
4.	 Position the Move tool within an image and click it, and then drag and 
drop the layer onto your destination file.

	 The dropped layer pops in as a new layer above the active layer in the 
image, as shown in Figure 1-12. You don’t need to have a selection bor­
der to copy the entire layer. But, if you want to copy just a portion of the 
layer, make your selection before you drag and drop with the Move tool. 
If you want the selected element to be centered on the destination file, 
press the Shift key while you drag and drop.

lean and mean.
	
If you have multiple elements on one layer and want to select only one of the 
elements to drag and drop, simply grab the Lasso tool and draw around the 
object. You don’t have to be superprecise, but don’t include any portion of 
the other elements on the layer. Then hold down the Ctrl key (Ô key on the 
Mac) and press the up-arrow key once. The element then becomes neatly 
selected. You can not only drag and drop the element but also move or edit 
it without affecting the other pixels on the layer. Flip to Book IV, Chapter 1 
for help with making selections.
Be sure to check out the nearby sidebar, “Bypassing the Clipboard,” for 
more on dragging and dropping.
Using the Paste into Selection command
The Paste into Selection command lets you put a copied or cut image on a 
separate layer while inserting that image into a selection border on another 
layer. That’s where the Edit➪Paste into Selection command comes in handy.

Compositing with Multiple Images
362
For example, if you want to make it appear as though a snake is poking its 
head out of the opening of a cave or a paintbrush is poking out of a can, 
Paste into Selection is your command (see Figure 1-13). Be sure to check out 
the Putting It Together project in this chapter to get more practice in using 
this practical technique.
Follow these steps to insert a copied or cut selected image into a selection 
outline:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, make the selection on the layer that 
you want the image to fill.
	
	 It’s the destination layer.
	
2.	 Select the image that will fill that selection.
	
	 This source image can be within the same file or from another file.
	
3.	 Choose Edit➪Copy.
	
4.	 Return to the destination image layer and choose Edit➪Paste Into 
Selection.
	
	 The pasted selection is visible only inside the selection outline (refer to 
Figure 1-13). If necessary, reposition your pasted selection with the 
Move tool. If you need to scale the pasted selection, choose Image➪
Transform➪Free Transform. For more on transformations, see Chapter 2 
of this minibook. In our example, our carrots are showing only inside 
our selection. The bottoms of the carrots are hidden, making it look as 
though they’re sitting inside the Chinese takeout container.
Bypassing the Clipboard
Yes, you can always cut and paste or copy and 
paste a layer from one image to another, but 
we prefer to drag and drop, rather than copy 
and paste, between two images. By drag­
ging and dropping, you bypass the temporary 
storage area for copied and stored data — 
the Clipboard. (Whenever you copy or cut a 
selection, Elements stores the selection on 
the Clipboard until you’re ready to paste it to 
its new home.) So, what’s wrong with that? 
Well, nothing, unless you’re working with 
high-resolution images. Storing images on the 
Clipboard, even temporarily, can slow down 
your system. Keeping your Clipboard clear of 
data ensures that Elements is running lean and 
mean so that you can drag and drop more im­
ages, selections, and layers more quickly and 
more efficiently. If you want to perform a little 
spring cleaning on your Clipboard, you can 
always choose Edit➪Clear➪Clipboard Con­
tents, which empties it of any stored data.

Putting It Together
Creating Layers and Using the Paste into Selection 
Command to Make a Collage
You probably remember from elementary school cutting out a bunch of pictures from 
magazines and pasting them on a piece of construction paper. Well, with Elements, 
the idea of a collage isn’t much different, but the activity is a little more refined. 
Maybe you want to unleash your artistic side. Or, maybe you need to combine several 
images into one as part of a job. Whatever your reason, you can use the steps here 
to get started on your first collage. And by the way, if collage is too prissy a word for 
you, you can substitute it with composite — which has the definition “derived from 
many components.” We usually do.

Creating a collage takes many steps. Throughout this minibook, you can find several 
ongoing Putting It Together projects, all of which build on each other and lead you to a 
finished collage. Be sure to save your collage file so that you can work on it while you 
make your way through this minibook, if you like. 
If you’re short on photos, you can go to www.gettyimages.com. Be sure to regis­
ter so that you have access to a huge gallery of free comping images. Comping images 
are small, low-resolution images used for internal corporate or personal noncommercial 
use only. You can also purchase high-resolution images for a song (from $1 to $20) at 
www.istockphoto.com or www.stockxpert.com. If that’s too pricey for you, 
check out stock.xchng at www.sxc.hu, where you can find user-uploaded files and 
download them for free. Just be sure to ask for the photographer’s permission if you want 
to use the images for anything other than practice. 
To create the first layer of your collage, follow these steps: 
	
1.	 Decide on two images you want to use in your collage and open them in the Editor, 
in Edit Full mode, by choosing File➪Open. 
	
	 You can pick an image to use as your main canvas and then open a supporting 
image that you can select and then drag onto that main image. However, if you 
want, you can also start with just a blank document, which is what we’ve done. We 
then filled our blank image with light green. See Book V, Chapter 2 for details on 
filling with color.

2.	 Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers panel. 
	
	 Always be sure that the Layers panel is visible whenever you’re creating a compos­
ite from multiple images. You need to see what’s happening while you drag and 
drop, and you need to be aware, at all times, of which layer you’re working on.
	
3.	 Select an element in the supporting image. 
	
	 Feel free to use whichever selection method suits your fancy, but remember that the 
finished collage will look only as good as its individual selections. For more on 
making selections, see Book IV. 
	
	 We used the Quick Selection tool to select the girl. We then used the Lasso tool and 
cleaned up our selection border. 
	
4.	 Choose Select➪Modify➪Contract and, in the Contract Selection dialog box, enter 
a value. Then choose Select➪Feather and enter a value in the Feather Selection 
dialog box. 
	
	 Contract the selections lightly (we chose a value of 1 pixel) before you apply a 
feather (we chose a 0.5 pixel value) to avoid picking up some of the background 
during the feathering process. Note that the values you choose depend on the reso­
lution of your images; the lower the resolution, the smaller the value needed. 

Compositing with Multiple Images

	 Using a small feather helps to avoid the harsh, I-cut-it-out-with-a-pair-of-pinking-
shears look. 
	
5.	 With the Move tool, drag and drop the selection onto the background image. 
	
	 The Layers panel shows that you’ve produced a layer. Notice that your main image 
remains as the background below the layer, as shown in the figure. 
	
	 Don’t worry if your element isn’t the right size. You can find a Putting It Together 
project in Book VI, Chapter 2 that shows you how to scale the layer. 
	
6.	 Choose File➪Save As. In the Save As dialog box, name the file collage and make 
sure the format is Photoshop.
	
	 Keep the file in a handy spot on your hard drive so that you can find it when you’re 
ready to do more with your collage.
In the preceding steps, we show you how to create a layer by dragging and dropping an 
image onto a background image. The process we demonstrate in the following steps is a 
little different. It entails pasting one selection into another. 
To paste one selection into another on your collage, follow these steps: 
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, choose File➪Open. Select the file you saved from 
the preceding exercise. Also, open a new supporting image. 
	
2.	 Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers panel. 
	
	 Always keep the Layers panel visible whenever you’re creating a composite from 
multiple images.

	 We wanted to use the whole image, so we chose Select➪All. 
	
4.	 Contract and feather the selection (as described in Step 4 in the preceding set

Chapter 2: Managing Layers
In This Chapter
✓	Viewing, moving, and shuffling layers
✓	Transforming layers
✓	Simplifying layers
✓	Aligning and distributing layers
✓	Linking and locking layers
✓	Flattening and merging layers
H
opefully, you had the time and inclination to check out the first chap­
ter of Book VI. That’s where you get all the basic information on creat­
ing layers. In this chapter, you get all the details on how to manage the 
layers you’ve created. And, unlike some employees, clients, or children, lay­
ers are extremely agreeable to being managed — even micromanaged, for 
that matter. You can scale and rotate them, hide them, rearrange them, link 
and lock them, and even condense them into one loving, collective layer. 
Yes, Elements has a slew of ways to get your layers lined up in the orderly 
and organized fashion you deserve.
Viewing Layers
Often, hiding all layers in your image except for the 
layer you want to edit is useful. You can then focus 
on the element at hand without the distraction of 
seeing all the other elements of the image. You can 
hide layers with a single quick click of the mouse 
button, as we describe in the following list:
	
✓	Hide all the layers but one. Select the layer you 
want to display. Alt-click (Option-click on the 
Mac) the eye icon for that layer in the left column 
of the Layers panel and all other layers disappear 
from view. To redisplay all the layers, Alt-click (Option-
click on the Mac) the eye icon again.
	
✓	Hide an individual layer. Click the eye icon for that layer, as shown in 
Figure 2-1. To redisplay the layer, click the blank space in the eye 
column.

Viewing Layers
370
Corbis Digital Stock/Purestock
Figure 2-1: You can hide and show individual layers to better focus your tasks.
	
Only visible layers print. Hiding layers for printing can be useful if you want 
to have several versions (each on a separate layer) of an image for a project 
within the same document. You can view selective layers and print them, get 
approval from the powers-that-be, and then delete the layers with the 
scrapped versions. Only one file to manage — even we can handle that.
Rearranging Layers
You can shuffle the order of layers like clear sheets of acetate used with 
overhead projectors. The stacking order of the layers in the Layers panel cor­
responds to the order of the layers in the document. If you want to move a 
layer to another position in the stacking order, drag the layer up or down in 
the Layers panel. While you drag, you see a fist icon. Release the mouse but­
ton when a highlighted line appears where you want to insert the layer.

371
Book VI
Chapter 2
Managing Layers
Moving Layer Elements
371
Alternatively, you can change the order by selecting the layer and then 
choosing Layer➪Arrange. Then select one of the following commands from 
the submenu:
	
✓	Bring to Front and Send to Back: Send the layer to the top or bottom of 
the stacking order.
	
✓	Bring Forward and Send Backward: Move the layer one level up or down.
	
✓	Reverse: Switch the order of your layer stack when you have two or 
more layers selected.
	
If your image has a background, it always remains the bottommost layer. 
If you need to move the background, first convert it to a layer by double-
clicking the name in the Layers panel. Enter a new name for the layer and 
then click OK.
Moving Layer Elements
Rearranging layers is different from moving the content on the layer. 
Because the elements on a layer are free-floating on a bed of transparency, 
you can easily move the element whenever necessary. Moving the element 
on one layer has no effect on any of the other layers and doesn’t harm the 
image.
To move an image on a layer, first select the layer in the Layers panel. Then 
position the Move tool (the four-headed arrow in the Tools panel) anywhere 
on the image and drag it to the position you want. It doesn’t get any simpler 
than that. Here are a few more handy tips for moving an image and using the 
Move tool:
	
✓	Move the image on the layer in 1-pixel increments. Press an arrow key 
when you have the Move tool selected. To move the layer in 10-pixel 
increments, press Shift when you press the arrow key.
	
✓	Find out which layer holds the image you want to move or edit. If you 
have the Auto-Select Layer option selected in the Options bar, select the 
Move tool and click the element. Elements automatically activates the 
layer that the element resides on. If you don’t have this option selected, 
Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) the image.
	
✓	Switch to a layer when you click with the Move tool on any part of a 
layer. To do this trick, select the Auto-Select Layer option on the 
Options bar. But be careful when using this option, especially if you 
have a lot of overlapping elements — you may inadvertently select a 
layer when you don’t want to.

Transforming Layers
372
	
✓	Display a bounding box (a rectangle that encloses a selection or an 
image on a layer) that has handles around the elements on your layer. 
To do this one, select the Show Bounding Box check box on the Options 
bar. This box can be useful if all your elements are melting into one 
another in an indistinguishable conglomeration.
	
	
We recommend keeping this option selected so that you have essentially 
the same controls (scale, rotate, and so on) as when you choose Image➪
Transform➪Free Transform.
	
✓	Show Highlight on Rollover: Hover your mouse on any element found 
on the canvas and an outline magically appears around the element on 
your layer. Click the highlighted layer to select it and then move it.
Transforming Layers
When working with multiple images, you no doubt have to scale, or even 
rotate, some images to fit them into your composite. Fortunately, Elements 
makes scaling an easy chore by providing you with the Transform and Free 
Transform commands on the Image menu. When it comes to transforming 
layers and transforming selections, the methods are identical. After an ele­
ment is on a layer, you can just choose the appropriate transformation com­
mand and off you go. In addition, you can apply a transformation to multiple 
layers simultaneously if you select the various layers first. 
Here’s how to transform a layer:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, select a layer in the Layers panel.
	
	 You can also apply a transformation to multiple layers simultaneously 
by linking the layers first. For details, see “Linking Layers,” later in this 
chapter.
	
2.	 Choose Image➪Transform➪Free Transform.
	
	 A bounding box surrounds the contents of your layer, as shown in Figure 
2-2. (In our example, the bounding box surrounds Layer 3.) Drag a corner 
or side handle to size the contents. Press Shift while dragging to con­
strain the proportions. You can also click the link icon between the W 
and H fields to do the same. To rotate the contents, move the mouse cur­
sor just outside a corner handle until it turns into a curved arrow and 
then drag. To distort, skew, or apply perspective to the contents, right-
click and choose a command from the contextual menu that appears. 
You can also click the Rotate, Scale, and Skew icons in the Options bar as 
well as enter your transform values numerically in the fields.
	
	 If you want to apply just a single transformation, you can also choose the 
individual Distort, Skew, and Perspective commands from the Image➪
Transform menu. Or, to rotate or flip, you can choose Image➪Rotate.

3.	 When your layer is transformed to your liking, double-click inside the 
bounding box.
	
	 The bounding box disappears, leaving behind your transformed layer.

Figure 2-2: Transform your layers.
	
Try to perform all transformations in one execution. Don’t go back numer­
ous times to apply various transformations. Each time you transform pixels, 
you put your image through the interpolation process (increasing, decreas­
ing, or remapping pixels). Done repeatedly, this process can degrade the 
quality of your image, which is why it’s prudent to use the Transform➪
Free Transform command rather than individual commands — so that all 
transformations are executed in one fell swoop.
Simplifying Layers
When you simplify a layer, you’re simply converting a type layer, shape layer, 
or fill layer into a regular image layer. You want to do this to apply filters or 
to edit the layers with painting tools. However, simplifying comes with a 
price: After you simplify a shape layer, for example, you no longer have access 
to the shape-editing options, only the editing options available to a regular 
image layer. And, when you simplify a type layer, your text is converted to pix­
els, so you can’t edit your text anymore. The moral of the story? Be sure your 
type is spelled and formatted to your liking before simplifying.

Simiplifying Layers
374
Here’s how to simplify a layer:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, select a layer in the Layers panel.
	
2.	 Choose Layer➪Simplify Layer. You can also choose the command 
from the Layers panel menu (click the down-pointing arrow in the 
upper-right corner of the panel). If you select a shape layer, you can 
also click the Simplify command in the Options bar.
Putting It Together
Transforming and Moving Layers in a Collage
When you have a couple images in your collage (see the Putting It Together project in 
Book VI, Chapter 1), you can start transforming them to your liking. Moving and scaling 
are the manipulations you’ll probably do the most. Elements enables you to transform 
layers without affecting any other layer within the image. To transform and move images 
in a collage, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, choose File➪Open. Select your saved collage file 
in the dialog box that opens.
	
2.	 Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers panel.
	
3.	 In the Layers panel, select the layer (or layers) you want to transform.
	
	 In our example, we chose the layers that have the girl and the picture on the screen 
of the laptop.

4.	 Choose Image➪Transform➪Free Transform.
	
	 The Free Transform bounding box appears around your layer.
	
	 By choosing Free Transform, you interpolate the image only once, rather than 
multiple times.
	
5.	 Shift-drag a corner transformation handle to scale the image down to the size you 
want but maintain its proportions, which reduces the amount of distortion.
	
	 We reduced the girl and screen about 20%.
	
6.	 Position the cursor just outside the handle until a curved arrow appears. Rotate the 
image the desired amount. 
	
	 Our layers didn’t need any rotation.
	
7.	 After you scale and rotate your image, place the cursor inside the Free Transform 
bounding box and position your layer elements by dragging them to your desired 
location.
	
	 We positioned our layers at the bottom of the Image window.

8.	 When you transform the selection to your liking, double-click inside the Free 
Transform bounding box or press Enter (Return on the Mac).
	
9.	 Transform any remaining layers, following Steps 3 through 8.
	
	 If you’re transforming a layer with a layer mask, be sure to choose the layer’s 
thumbnail and not the layer mask thumbnail. Otherwise, you transform the layer 
mask rather than the layer.

10.	 As always, when you transform a selection to your liking, double-click inside the 
Free Transform bounding box.
	
11.	 Choose File➪Save.
You probably already have a good sense of the possibilities (which are infinite) available 
to you when you create and change collages. Of course, you can always add more stuff 
to a collage and rearrange its layers, as needed. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, choose File➪Open and select your collage file. 
Also open another image.
	
	 We chose an image of a temple in Kyoto.
	
2.	 Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers panel — if it isn’t already visible.
	
3.	 Select an element in the new image you open.
	
	 It goes without saying that making the selection accurate can only enhance your 
composite. We want to use our whole image, so we didn’t need to make a selection.
	
4.	 Contract and feather the image’s edges (as described in the Putting It Together 
project in Chapter 1 of this minibook) and use the Move tool to drag the selection 
into the collage file.
	
	 For the most consistent appearance possible, use consistent values for modifying 
and feathering all selections in this composite.
	
5.	 Position and transform the selection, as needed.
	
	 Follow the directions provided in the preceding step list. In our example, we scaled 
the temple image about 50 percent smaller and positioned it in the upper-right 
corner.

Aligning and Distributing Layers
If you’re a precision junkie, like we are, you’ll appreciate Elements’s ability 
to align and distribute your layers. These commands can be especially use­
ful when you need to align such items as navigation buttons on a Web page 
mockup or a row of head shots for a corporate publication.
Follow these steps to align and distribute your layers:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, select the layers you want to align in 
the Layers panel, as shown in Figure 2-3.
	
	 Select your first layer and then Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) to select 
more layers. 
Figure 2-3: Select the layers you want to align in the Layers panel.
	
6.	 In the Layers panel, rearrange your layers, if needed, by selecting a layer and 
dragging it above another layer.
	
	 In our image, we dragged the temple layer below the girl and screen layers, as 
shown in the figure.
	
	 Because layers are independent entities, you can shuffle them indefinitely, like a 
deck of cards.
	
7.	 Choose File➪Save.

Aligning and Distributing Layers
378
	
2.	 With the Move tool selected from the Tools panel, click the Align 
option in the Options bar and choose an alignment option from the 
drop-down list.
	
	 Elements provides you with handy little icons that illustrate the various 
alignment types, as shown in Figure 2-4.
Figure 2-4: The Options bar offers different alignment buttons.
	
	 Note that, depending on which align­
ment type you choose, Elements aligns 
to the layer element that’s the farthest 
from the top, bottom, left, or right. If 
you align to the center, Elements splits 
the difference among the various 
layers.
	
3.	 In the Layers panel, select three or 
more layers that you want to distrib­
ute evenly.
	
4.	 With the Move tool selected from the 
Tools panel, click the Distribute 
option in the Options bar and choose 
a distribution option from the drop-
down list.
	
	 The Distribute commands evenly space 
the layers between the first and last ele­
ments in either the row or column.
	
	 As with aligning, you find an icon 
illustrating the distribution types. You 
can see the buttons from Figure 2-3 
precisely aligned and evenly distributed 
in Figure 2-5.

Linking Layers
You’ll probably find that you don’t 
need to link layers in most cases. 
Simply select multiple layers and apply 
your command — moving, scaling, 
rotating, and so on. Occasionally, how­
ever, you may want to link layers so 
that they stay grouped as a unit until 
you decide otherwise.
To link layers, follow these short steps:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, 
select some layers in the Layers 
panel.
	
2.	 Click the Link Layers icon at the 
bottom of the Layers panel, as 
shown in Figure 2-6.
	
	 A link icon appears to the right of 
the layer name in the Layers panel.
	
	 To remove a link, click the Link 
Layers icon again.
Locking Layers
After you have your layers how you 
want them, you may want to lock them 
to prevent them from being changed, 
as shown in Figure 2-7. To lock a layer, 
select it in the Layers panel and select 
one of the two lock options at the bot­
tom of the Layers panel. The checker­
board square icon locks all transparent 
areas of your layers: You’re prevented 
from painting or editing any transpar­
ent areas on the layers. The lock icon 
locks your entire layer and prevents it 
from being changed in any way, includ­
ing moving or transforming the ele­
ments on the layer. You can, however, 
still make selections on the layer. To 
unlock the layer, simply click the icon 
again to toggle off the lock.

group your layers.

By default, the background is locked and can’t be unlocked until you convert 
the background into a layer by choosing Layer➪New➪Layer from Background. 
In addition, by default, type and shape layers have the Lock Transparent Pixels 
option selected. These options are gray and can’t be deselected. However, if 
you need to paint on the type or shape layer, you can always simplify it (as 
described earlier in this chapter), thereby removing the locked option.
Flattening and Merging Layers
True layers evangelists that we are, we tout the glories of layers in the first 
chapter of this minibook. And, although layers are wonderful, they have a 
dark side: They can make your file go from slim and trim to bulky and 
bloated. Not only do you get a larger file size that slows your computer sys­
tem’s performance, but you’re also limited to the file formats that allow you 
to save layers: Photoshop’s native format (.psd), TIFF (.tif), and PDF 
(.pdf). If you save your file in any other format, Elements smushes your 
layers into a background. This file limitation often forces users to save two 
versions of every layered file — one as a native Photoshop file and one as 
something else, such as EPS or JPEG, to import into another program. (For 
more on file formats, see Book III, Chapter 2.)
To curb large file sizes or to use your image in a nonlayer supporting format, 
you have a couple options:
	
✓	Merge layers: Combines visible, linked, or adjacent layers into a single 
layer (not a background). The intersection of all transparent areas is 
retained. You can also merge adjustment or fill layers, but they can’t 
act as the target layer for the merge. Merging layers can help decrease 
your file size and make your documents more manageable. You’re still 
restricted to the layer-friendly file formats, however.
	
✓	Flatten an image: Combines all visible layers into a background. 
Elements deletes hidden layers and fills any transparent areas with 
white. Flattening is usually reserved for when you’re finished editing 
your image. We recommend, however, that before you flatten your 
image, you make a copy of the file with all its layers intact and save it as 
a native Photoshop file. That way, if you ever need to make any edits, 
you have the added flexibility of having your layers.
Merging layers
You can merge your layers in several ways. However, to use the first option, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, ensure that all the layers that you 
want to merge are visible in the Layers panel, shown in Figure 2-8.

Chapter 2
Managing Layers

2.	 Choose Merge Visible from the 
Layers panel pop-up menu or the 
Layer menu.
	
	 All visible layers merge into a sin­
gle Background layer, as shown in 
Figure 2-8. 
	
Hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) 
when choosing Layer➪Merge Visible. 
Elements merges those layers onto a 
new layer.
You can also merge layers by following 
these steps:
	
1.	 Position the layers that you want 
to merge adjacent to each other in 
the Layers panel.
	
2.	 Select the top layer of those you 
want merged.
	
3.	 Choose Merge Down from the 
Layers panel pop-up menu or the 
Layer menu.
	
	 Note that Merge Down merges 
your active layer with the layer 
directly below it.
Flattening layers
To flatten an image into a single back­
ground, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, 
ensure that all layers you want to 
retain are visible in the Layers 
panel.
	
	 Elements discards all hidden layers.
	
2.	 Choose Layer➪Flatten Image or 
choose Flatten Image from the 
Layers panel pop-up menu.
	
	 The transparent areas of flattened 
images fill with the background 
color and appear as a background 
in the Layers panel, as shown in 
Figure 2-9.
Figure 2-9: Flatten your layers only if you’re 
sure that you no longer need individual layers.
Figure 2-8: Merging layers can make your 
file size a lot smaller.

	 If you mistakenly flatten your image, you can undo the command imme­
diately by choosing Edit➪Undo. If you go ahead and perform another 
action, undo your mistake by using the Undo History panel. However, 
note that if the flattening step is no longer in the Undo History panel, 
you have no way to undo the flattening.
Putting It Together
Checking Your Collage for Flaws and Consolidating Layers
When you begin a project, you may think you know what you want the result to look like. 
But when your creative juices start flowing, you may decide that something doesn’t look 
right. For example, while we were working on our collage, we felt that our green back­
ground was a little boring.
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open the saved collage file and open a new image 
that you want to incorporate into the collage.
	
	 In our example, we thought the green background needed some texture, so we 
opened an image that contained some Japanese characters we like.
	
2.	 Select the part of the image that you want to add to your collage, as shown in the 
figure.
	
	 We wanted the whole image, so we didn’t need to make a selection.

When you’re close to finalizing your collage, you might want to consolidate layers. Mini­
mizing the number of layers makes projects easier to manage and your file size smaller, 
which is helpful when you get ready to add the finishing touches to your collage.
	
Before you merge your layers, be sure that you’ll never have to manipulate them sepa­
rately again, especially if the elements on the layer overlap each other, as ours do.
To consolidate two layers, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, select the layers in the Layers panel.
	
2.	 Choose Merge Layers from the Layers panel pop-up menu.
	
	 The two layers merge and become one.
	
3.	 Choose File➪Save.

Chapter 3: Playing with Opacity 
and Blend Modes
In This Chapter
✓	Adjusting opacity
✓	Applying blend modes for effects
✓	Setting the blend options
I
n this chapter, we show you how to have a little fun and get those cre­
ative juices flowing. This chapter, along with Chapters 1 and 3 in Book 
VII, gives you a few ways to tweak the layers you’ve so diligently created. 
Maybe you want to make one of your layers semitransparent so that you can 
see the layer beneath it; or you might want to try blending the colors 
between a couple layers in a way that’s slightly offbeat. Look no further.
Take these techniques as far as you want. And remember: There’s no substi­
tute for good-old experimentation. Before you jump into these techniques, 
you should have a handle on the methods of layer creation and management 
that we explain in Book VI, Chapters 1 and 2.
Adjusting Layer Opacity
By far one of the easiest ways to make your image 
look interesting is to have one image ghosted over 
another, as shown in Figure 3-1. Creating this effect 
is an easy task with the Opacity option in the 
Layers panel. You adjust the opacity by selecting a 
layer in the Layers panel. Then either access the 
slider by clicking the right-pointing arrow or enter a 
percentage value in the Opacity text box.
The Opacity setting allows you to mix the active layer 
with the layers below it in varying percentages from 
100% (completely opaque) to 0% (completely transparent). 
Remember that you can adjust the opacity only on a layer, not 
on the Background.

Creatively Mixing with Blend Modes
386
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 3-1: Adjusting the opacity enables one image to ghost over another.
	
You can also change the Opacity percentage by using keyboard shortcuts. 
With any tool active, except a painting tool or an editing tool, press a number 
key. Press 5 for 50%, 25 for 25%. If you’re entering a 2-digit value, just be sure 
to type the numbers quickly or else Elements interprets the numbers as two 
different values. You get the picture. Note that for the default of 100%, you 
must press 0.
Creatively Mixing with Blend Modes
Elements sports an impressive 25 Blend modes. Blend modes affect how 
colors interact between layers and how colors interact when you apply paint 
to a layer. Blend modes can produce a multitude of interesting, sometimes 
even bizarre, effects. What’s more, you can easily apply, edit, or discard 
Blend modes without modifying your image pixels one iota.
Blend modes are located on a drop-down list at the top of your Layers panel 
in Edit Full mode. The best way to get a feel for the effect of Blend modes 
isn’t to memorize the descriptions we give you in the following sections. 

Book VI
Chapter 3
Playing with 
Opacity and Blend 
Modes
Creatively Mixing with Blend Modes
387
Instead, grab an image with some layers and apply each Blend mode to one 
or more of the layers to see what happens. In fact, try a few different images 
because the effects may be subtle or intense, depending on the colors in the 
image. Throw in some different opacity percentages and you’re on your way 
to endless hours of creative fun.
	
You’ll see these modes called Blend modes, Painting modes, Brush modes, 
Layer modes, calculations, or just plain modes. They’re usually referred to as 
Blend modes or Layer modes when used with layers and painting modes, and 
as Brush modes when used in conjunction with a painting or an editing tool.
General Blend modes
Normal blend mode doesn’t require an explanation. It’s the one you probably 
use the most. Dissolve is the next one on the list and, ironically, is probably the 
one you use the least (see both at work in Figure 3-2):
	
✓	Normal: The default mode displays each pixel unadjusted.
	
✓	Dissolve: You can see this mode only on a layer with an opacity setting 
of less than 100%. The lower the opacity, the more intense the effect. 
Dissolve allows some pixels from lower layers, which are randomized, to 
show through the target (selected) layer.
Blend modes that darken
Overall, the Blend modes we cover in this section all produce effects that 
darken your image, as shown in Figure 3-3.
	
Here’s one of our favorite uses for the Darken blend mode. Scan a handwrit­
ten letter or sheet of music and layer it over an image. Apply the Darken 
blend mode to the letter or sheet music layer. The white areas of the paper 
become transparent, and only the letters or musical notes display, creating a 
nice composite image.
	
✓	Darken: Turns lighter pixels transparent if the pixels on the target layer 
are lighter than those on layers below. If the pixels are darker, they’re 
unchanged.
	
✓	Multiply: Burns the target layer onto the layers underneath, thereby 
darkening all colors where they mix. With layers, it’s comparable to 
sticking two slides in the same slot in a slide projector. When you’re 
painting with the Brush or Pencil tool, each stroke creates a darker 
color, as though you’re drawing with markers.
	
✓	Color Burn: Darkens the layers underneath the target layer and burns 
them with color, creating an increased contrast effect, like applying a 
dark dye to your image. Blending with white pixels has no effect.

Creatively Mixing with Blend Modes
388
	
✓	Linear Burn: Darkens the layers underneath the target layer by decreasing 
the brightness. This effect is similar to Multiply but often makes portions 
of your image black. Blending with white has no effect.
	
✓	Darker Color: When blending two layers, the darker color of the two 
colors is visible.

Blend modes that lighten
If you have Blend modes that darken, well, having modes that lighten just makes 
good sense. So, if you have the need to throw some digital bleach on your 
brightly colored pixels, try out a couple of these Blend modes, as shown in 
Figure 3-4:
	
✓	Lighten: Turns darker pixels transparent if the pixels on the target layer 
are darker than those on layers below. If the pixels are lighter, they’re 
unchanged. This effect is the opposite of Darken.
	
✓	Screen: Lightens the target layer where it mixes with the layers underneath. 
Blending with black has no effect. Like putting two slides in different 
projectors and pointing them at the same screen. This effect is the 
opposite of Multiply.
	
✓	Color Dodge: Lightens the pixels in the layers underneath the target 
layer and infuses them with colors from the top layer. Blending with black 
has no effect. This effect is similar to applying a bleach to your image.

Creatively Mixing with Blend Modes
390
	
✓	Linear Dodge: Lightens the layers underneath the target layer by increas­
ing the brightness. This effect is similar to Screen but often makes parts of 
your image pure white. Blending with black pixels has no effect.
	
✓	Lighter Color: When you’re blending two layers, the lighter color of the 
two colors is visible.

Lighting blend modes
This group of Blend modes plays with the lighting in your layers. Some of 
these Blend modes, such as Pin Light, are best reserved for the occasional 
wacky special effect. See the Blend modes in action in Figure 3-5:
	
✓	Overlay: Multiplies the dark pixels in the target layer and screens the 
light pixels in the underlying layers. Enhances the contrast and saturation 
of colors.

Figure 3-5: These Blend modes adjust the lighting between your image 
layers.
	
✓	Soft Light: Darkens the dark pixels (greater than 50% gray) and lightens 
the light pixels (less than 50% gray). Blending with black or white results 
in darker or lighter pixels, but doesn’t make parts of your image pure 
black or pure white. It’s similar to Overlay, but softer and subtler. The 
effect is like shining a soft spotlight on the image.

Creatively Mixing with Blend Modes
392
	
✓	Hard Light: This mode multiplies the dark pixels (greater than 50% gray) 
and screens the light pixels (less than 50% gray). It can be used to add 
highlights and shadows to an image. Blending with black or white gives 
you black and white. The effect is similar to shining a bright, hard 
spotlight on the image. 
	
✓	Vivid Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% gray, this 
mode darkens the colors by increasing the contrast. If the pixels on the 
top layer are lighter than 50% gray, the mode lightens the colors by 
decreasing the contrast. It’s a combination of Color Burn and Color Dodge.
	
✓	Linear Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% gray, the 
mode darkens the colors by decreasing the brightness. If the pixels on 
the top layer are lighter than 50% gray, the mode lightens the colors by 
increasing the brightness. It’s a combination of Linear Burn and Linear 
Dodge.
	
✓	Pin Light: Replaces the colors of pixels, depending on the colors in the 
top layer. If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% gray, the 
mode replaces the pixels that are darker than those on the top layer and 
doesn’t change pixels that are lighter. If the pixels on the top layer are 
lighter than 50% gray, the mode replaces the pixels that are lighter than 
those pixels on the top layer and doesn’t change pixels that are darker. 
It’s a combination of Darken and Lighten; useful for special effects.
	
✓	Hard Mix: Similar to Vivid Light, but reduces the colors to a total of 
eight — cyan, magenta, yellow, black, red, green, blue, and white. Although 
the results depend on the mix of existing colors on the top and bottom 
layers, this mode usually creates a highly posterized (a cartoon or flat 
illustration) effect.
Blend modes that invert
If the Blend modes discussed in the preceding sections are a little too sedate 
for you, you may want to experiment with the inverters — Difference and 
Exclusion. These Blend modes invert your colors and can produce some 
interesting special effects, as shown in Figure 3-6.
	
✓	Difference: Produces a negative, or inverted, effect according to the 
brightness values on the top layers. If the pixels on the top layer are 
black, no change occurs in the underlying layers. If the pixels on the top 
layer are white, the mode inverts the colors of the underlying layers. It 
can produce some intense effects.
	
✓	Exclusion: Like Difference, but with less contrast and saturation. If the 
pixels on the top layer are black, no change occurs in the underlying lay­
ers. If the pixels on the top layer are white, this mode inverts the colors 
of the underlying layers. Medium colors blend to create shades of gray.

HSL color model Blend modes
These Blend modes use the HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) color model to 
mix colors, as shown in Figure 3-7. 
	
✓	Hue: Blends the luminance (brightness) and saturation (intensity of the 
color) of the underlying layers with the hue (color) of the top layer.

Creatively Mixing with Blend Modes
394
	
✓	Saturation: Blends the luminance and hue of the underlying layers with 
the saturation of the top layer.
	
✓	Color: Blends the luminance of the underlying layers with the saturation 
and hue of the top layer. This mode enables you to paint color while 
preserving the shadows, highlights, and details of the underlying layers.
	
	Our favorite Blend mode in this group is Color; you use it to apply 
color to images without obscuring the tonality. Color mode is great 
for “hand painting” grayscale images. If you’ve ever admired those 
hand-tinted black-and-white photos used in greeting cards and posters, 
you can create the same effect fairly easily. First, make sure that your 
black-and-white image is in RGB (red, green, blue) mode so that it can 
accept color. Create a new layer on the Layers panel and set it to the 
Color blend mode. Grab the Brush tool (with a soft-edged tip), choose 
a color, and paint over your image. Adjust the opacity to less than 
100% to create a softer effect. See details on this technique in Book V, 
Chapter 1.
	
✓	Luminosity: The opposite of Color, this mode blends the hue and satura­
tion of the underlying layers with the luminance of the top layer. This 
mode also preserves the shadows, highlights, and details from the top 
layer and mixes them with the colors of the underlying layers.

Putting It Together
Adjusting Opacity Settings in Your Collage
If you’ve followed along with the Putting It Together projects we discuss in Book VI, 
Chapters 1 and 2, you may have a collage that you’re pretty satisfied with. You just need 
to make the final tweaks to get it to the state of perfection.
One of the most important tweaks you can make concerns opacity. Follow these steps to 
adjust the opacity settings on some of the layers:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open your saved collage file.
	
2.	 If the Layers panel isn’t already visible, choose Window➪Layers to open it.
	
3.	 Select a layer in your collage and move the Opacity slider, located at the top of the 
Layers panel, to the left or right.
	
	 If you want the layer to be more opaque, move the slider to the right. If you’re inter­
ested in making the layer more transparent, move the slider to the left.
	
	 We chose our Japanese characters layer and adjusted the opacity to 10%. We 
wanted the characters to create just a subtle texture, not to appear full strength.
istockphoto.com, Corbis Digital Stock
	
4.	 Save the file and then move on to the next layer that you want to adjust.
	
	 If you have more complicated opacity settings to adjust, keep reading.
	
5.	 Select another layer and then choose Duplicate Layer from the Layers panel 
pop-up menu. Click OK to close the Duplicate Layer dialog box.
	
	 Making a copy of a layer is useful because you can add a Blend mode and then 
adjust it to create just the right amount of the effect.

	 For example, if you want to define an element in your collage but applying it directly 
on the layer makes the effect too intense, make a copy of the layer. We made a copy 
of our temple layer.
	
6.	 Select the duplicated layer and choose a mode (such as Soft Light) from the Blend 
Mode pop-up menu in the Layers panel.
	
	 Leaving our duplicated and blended layer at 100% opacity is a little too garish.
	
7.	 Adjust the opacity to tone it down as much as you want.
	
	 We brought ours down to 25%.
	
8.	 When you’re satisfied with the opacity and contrast, save the collage file.
	
	 Oh, by the way, we added a dark green border and a lucky cat to our collage.

n Book IV, we present you with lots of information about making selections 
with the many tools that Elements provides for that very purpose, such 
as the Marquee and Lasso tools, the Magic Wand, the Quick Selection tool, 
and the Selection Brush. But we left the discussion of a few tools until this 
chapter. The tools in Book IV involve making selections by dragging around, 
clicking, or painting over. And though the result is similar — selecting what 
you want or don’t want in an image — the tools in this chapter are a little 
different in their methodology. They involve cutting out, extracting from, 
and erasing around.
To add to your selection repertoire, we give you details 
on layer masking, a feature that is the most versatile 
way to get what you want out of an image. Layer 
masking is essentially just another way of making a 
selection. Instead of defining your selection with a 
selection outline or by erasing away what you don’t 
want, you can use masks to define your selection 
with up to 256 levels of gray. This gives you varying 
levels of selection. You can choose to fully show 
your layer, partially show it, or hide (or mask) certain 
areas. The nice thing about layer masks is that you can 
creatively blend one layer into another in a multitude of 
different ways.
We round out this chapter by showing you how to create a 
clipping group, yet another way to blend your layers by masking 
your layers to the opaque areas of a base layer. Don’t worry: It may sound 
complicated, but it’s a piece of cake.

Working with the Cookie Cutter Tool
398
Working with the Cookie Cutter Tool
The Cookie Cutter tool is a cute name for a pretty powerful tool. Think of it 
as a Custom Shape tool for images. But, whereas the Custom Shape tool cre­
ates a mask and just hides everything outside the shape, the Cookie Cutter 
cuts away everything outside the shape, much like a traditional cookie cut­
ter does with dough. The preset libraries provide you with a variety of 
shapes, from animals and flowers to symbols and faces.
Here’s how to use the Cookie Cutter:
	
	 1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, choose the Cookie Cutter tool 
from the Tools panel.
	
	 The tool icon looks like a star. You can also press the Q key.
	
2.	 Specify the following options on the Options bar.
	
•	 Shape: Click the down-pointing arrow and choose a shape from the 
preset library in the drop-down panel. To load other libraries, click 
the panel pop-up menu and choose one from the submenu.
	
•	 Shape Options: Draw your shape using certain parameters:
	
	 Unconstrained: Draw freely using the default, Unconstrained.
	
	 Defined Proportions: Keep the height and width proportional.
	
	 Defined Size: Crop the image to the original, fixed size of the shape 
you choose. You can’t make it bigger or smaller.
	
	 Fixed Size: Enter a width and height.
	
	 From Center: Draw the shape from the center outward.
	
•	 Feather: Create a soft-edged selection.
	
•	 Crop: Crop the image into the shape. The shape fills the Image window.
	
3.	 Click and drag your mouse on the image to create your desired shape. 
Size the shape by dragging one handle of the bounding box. Position 
the shape by placing the mouse cursor inside the box and dragging.
	
	 You can also perform other types of transformations, such as rotating 
and skewing. For more on transformations, see Book IV, Chapter 2.
	
	 Take a gander at the Layers panel. Notice the temporary creation of a 
Layer Mask icon. See the section “Working with Layer Masks,” later in 
this chapter, for details on layer masks.
	
4.	 Click the Commit button on the Options bar and press Enter or 
double-click inside the bounding box to complete the cut.
	
	 Figure 4-1 shows our image cut into a flower. If you change your mind 
and don’t want the cut, click the Cancel button on the Options bar or 
press Esc.

Using the Magic Extractor
When you see a name like Magic Extractor, you may wonder whether you 
have to do anything except utter a mystical incantation to have your desired 
element cleanly plucked from its background. Unfortunately, it isn’t quite 
that easy, but it’s pretty close. You use the Magic Extractor command to 
make selections based on your identification of the foreground and back­
ground portions of your image. Specify your foreground and background by 
clicking these areas with the Brush tool and “marking” them. Click the magic 
OK button, and your object or objects are neatly and painlessly extracted.
	
Make a rough selection first before selecting the Magic Extractor command. 
This technique, which isn’t mandatory, restricts what’s extracted and can 
result in a more accurate selection.
Follow these steps to magically extract your element:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, choose Image➪Magic Extractor.
	
	 The Magic Extractor dialog box appears.
	
2.	 Choose the Foreground Brush tool from the dialog box and then click 
or drag to mark foreground areas — the areas you want to select.
	
	 The default color of the Foreground Brush is red, as shown in Figure 4-2.

Figure 4-2: Identify foreground and background areas with the 
Magic Extractor.
	
	 The more accurate the data you provide to the command’s algorithm, the 
more accurate your extraction. Be sure to use the Zoom and Hand tools 
to help magnify and move around your image as needed.
	
	 You can also change the size of your brush tip (from 1 to 100 pixels) in 
the Tool Options area on the right side of the dialog box. If necessary, 
change the color of your foreground and background colors by clicking 
the swatch and choosing a new color from the Color Picker.
	
3.	 Select the Background Brush tool from the dialog box and then click 
or drag to mark the background area — the portions you don’t want 
to select.
	
	 The default color of the Background Brush is blue.
	
4.	 Click Preview to view your extraction.
	
	 You can change the preview by going to the Preview section of the 
Magic Extractor dialog box and choosing either Selection Area or 
Original Photo from the Display pop-up menu.
	
	 If you want to see your selection against a different background, choose 
one from the Background pop-up list. (A black matte for a black 
background is nice.)

5.	 If the extraction needs more accuracy, you can refine the selection 
with the help of the Magic Extractor tools set, located along the left 
side of the dialog box:
	
	
•	 To erase any markings: Select the Point Eraser tool and click or drag 
over the offending areas.
	
	
•	 To add areas to the selection: Click or drag over your desired areas 
with the Add to Selection tool.
	
	
•	 To delete areas from the selection: Drag with the Remove from

•	 To smooth the edges of your foreground selection: Drag over the edges 
with the Smoothing Brush tool.
	
	 The following editing tricks use options found on the right side of the 
dialog box:
	
•	 To soften the edges of your 
selection: Enter a value in 
the Feather box — the 
higher the value, the 
softer the edge.
	
•	 To fill a hole: Click the Fill 
Holes button.
	
•	 To remove the halo of pix­
els between the foreground 
and background areas: 
Click Defringe and enter a 
value in the Defringe 
Width box.
	
	 If things start to go awry, you 
can start over by clicking 
Reset at the bottom of the 
dialog box.
	
6.	 When you’re pleased with 
the results, click OK to fin­
ish the extraction process 
and close the Magic 
Extractor dialog box.
	
	 Your newly extracted image 
appears as a new file, as 
shown in Figure 4-3.

Selective Erasing with the Eraser Tools
The eraser tools let you erase portions of an image. The three eraser tools 
are the regular Eraser, the Magic Eraser, and the Background Eraser, which 
all share a flyout menu in the Tools panel.
The eraser tools look like real erasers, so you can’t miss them. But just in 
case you do, press E and then Shift+E to toggle through the three tools.
	
When you erase pixels, those pixels are gone. For good. Before using the 
eraser tools, you should make a backup of your image. You can save the 
image as either a separate file or another layer. That way, if things run amok, 
you have some cheap insurance.
Using the Eraser tool
The Eraser tool allows you to erase areas on your image. If the image contains 
just a background, you erase to the background color. If the image is on a 
layer, you erase to transparency. Both instances are shown in Figure 4-4.
To use this tool, simply select the image and then click and drag through 
your desired area on it, and you’re done. Because it isn’t the most accurate 
tool on the planet, remember to zoom way in and use smaller brush tips to 
do some accurate erasing.

or, if you’re on a layer, transparency (right).

These options on the Options bar control the Eraser tool:
	
✓	Brush Presets: Click the drop-down panel to access the Brush presets. 
Choose the brush you want. Again, additional brush libraries are avail­
able from the Brushes pop-up menu.
	
✓	Size: Click the down-pointing arrow to access the Size slider. Choose 
from a brush size between 1 and 2500 pixels.
	
✓	Mode: Select from Brush, Pencil, and Block. When you select Brush or 
Pencil, you have access to the Brush Preset Picker panel on the far-left 
side of the Options bar. When you select Block, you’re stuck with one 
size (a 16-x-16-pixel square tip). But because the block size remains con­
stant, if you zoom way in, you can perform some detailed erasing.
	
✓	Opacity: Specify a percentage of transparency for the erased areas. The 
lower the Opacity setting, the less it erases. This option isn’t available 
for Block mode.
Selecting and erasing by color
The Magic Eraser tool works like a combination Eraser and Magic Wand 
tool. It selects and erases similarly colored pixels simultaneously. Here’s 
how it works:
	
✓	When you click a layer: The Magic Eraser tool erases pixels of a similar 
color based on a specified range and leaves the area transparent, as 
shown in Figure 4-5.

Figure 4-5: Clicking with the Magic Eraser simultaneously selects and 
erases similarly colored pixels.

✓	When you click the background: The Magic Eraser tool automatically con­
verts the background to a layer and then does the same pixel-erasing thing.
	
✓	When you click a layer with locked transparency: The Magic Eraser 
tool erases the pixels and replaces the area with the background color.
Here are the options for using the Magic Eraser tool:
	
✓	Tolerance: Defines the range of colors that Elements erases, just as it 
does with the Magic Wand tool. The value determines how similar a 
neighboring color has to be to the color that you click. A higher value 
picks up more colors, whereas a lower value picks up fewer colors.
	
✓	Anti-alias: Creates a slightly soft edge around the transparent area.
	
✓	Contiguous: Selects only similar colors that are adjacent to each other. 
Deselect this option to select and then delete similarly colored pixels 
wherever they appear in your image.
	
✓	Sample All Layers: Samples colors using data from all visible layers, but 
erases pixels on the active layer only.
	
✓	Opacity: Works like it does for the regular Eraser tool, described in the 
previous section.
Removing the background from an image
The Background Eraser tool is probably the most sophisticated of the 
eraser-tool lot. It erases the background from an image, and should leave the 
foreground untouched. But if you’re not careful in using the Background 
Eraser tool, it can erase the foreground and anything else in its path.
Like the Magic Eraser tool, the Background Eraser tool erases to transpar­
ency on a layer. If you drag on the background, Elements converts the back­
ground into a layer.
To use the Background Eraser tool successfully, carefully keep the cross­
hair, or hot spot, that appears in the center of the cursor, on the background 
pixels while you drag. The hot spot samples the color of the pixels and 
deletes pixels of that color wherever they fall under the brush circumfer­
ence. But, if you get close to a foreground pixel with the hot spot, that pixel 
is gobbled up as well. This tool works better with images that have good 
contrast in color between the background and foreground objects, as shown 
in Figure 4-6. Also, if your image has very detailed or wispy edges (such as 
hair or fur), you’re better off using the Magic Extractor command, which we 
describe earlier in this chapter.
Here’s the rundown on the options, found on the Options bar, for the 
Background Eraser:

✓	Brush Preset Picker: This option provides various settings to customize 
the size and appearance of your eraser brush tip. The Size and Tolerance 
settings at the bottom are for pressure-sensitive drawing tablets. You can 
base the size and tolerance on the pen pressure or position of the 
thumbwheel.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 4-6: Be careful when using the Background Eraser because 
you can inadvertently eat up pixels.
	
✓	Limits: The Contiguous setting erases similar colors that are adjacent to 
one another under the brush circumference. The Discontiguous setting 
erases similar colors whenever they’re under the brush circumference, 
regardless of whether they’re adjacent.
	
✓	Tolerance: Works just like the Magic Eraser Tolerance setting, described 
in the previous section.

Working with Layer Masks

Working with Layer Masks
Unfortunately, one of the areas where Photoshop has a leg up on Elements is 
in the area of layer masks. To create a layer mask in Photoshop, you merely 
have to click a button in the Layers panel. To get layer masks in Elements 
requires a clever work-around. And, fortunately, though it’s clever, it’s also 
very easy to do. But before we get ahead of ourselves and tell you how to get 
a layer mask, you may want to know what one is and why in the world you 
would ever need one.
A layer mask is like a second sheet of acetate that hovers over a layer. You 
can use layer masks with image layers and adjustment layers. In the case of 
an image layer, the layer mask allows you to selectively show, hide, or par­
tially show portions of your image. With adjustment layers, the layer mask 
lets you selectively apply the adjustment to the layers below it. You do this 
by painting on a layer mask with black, white, and various shades of gray. 
Any black areas on the mask hide the image or the adjustment; any white 
areas show the image or adjustment; and anything in between (gray) par­
tially shows the image or adjustment, as shown in Figure 4-7.
Layer masks are excellent for blending layers of images and creating soft 
transitions between elements. You can gradually brush in transparency and 
opacity on a selective-pixel basis. You can even apply gradients and filters to 
your layer masks to create interesting special effects.

Figure 4-7: A layer mask uses varying shades of gray to selectively 
apply the adjustment to the underlying layers.

Working with Layer Masks
407
Book VI
Chapter 4
Cutting, Extracting, 
and Masking
By default, the mask is completely white. This allows the image or adjustment 
to be fully applied to the layers. If you paint on a layer mask with black, the 
areas under those black areas don’t show the image or adjustment. If you 
paint with a shade of gray, those areas partially show the image or adjustment. 
The darker the shade of gray, the less it shows the image or adjustment. 
Note that if you have an active selection border in your image before you 
add an adjustment layer, the adjustment is applied only to that area within 
the selection border. The resulting layer mask also reflects that selection: 
The selected areas are white, and the unselected areas are black.
Now comes the clever part. We mention in the first paragraph in this section 
that Elements doesn’t have a layer mask option in the Layers panel. The only 
way to get a layer mask in Elements is to create an adjustment layer. When 
you create an adjustment layer, you also create a layer mask on that layer at 
the same time. If you don’t need any adjustments and just want the layer 
mask, after you create the adjustment layer just don’t make any adjustment 
settings. Then use the layer mask to blend two layers.
Just to make things crystal clear, follow these steps to create a layer mask:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open or create your layered image.
	
2.	 In the Layers panel, select the bottommost layer of the two layers you 
want to blend.
	
	 You want to sandwich the adjustment layers between the two layers you 
want to blend.
	
3.	 Choose Layer➪New Adjustment Layer➪Levels.
	
	 You can choose any of the adjustments because you don’t specify any 
settings. Remember that creating an adjustment layer is the only way to 
get the layer mask.
	
4.	 Click OK in the New Layer dialog box.
	
	 The Levels dialog box appears. Don’t specify any settings in the dialog 
box. Just click OK.
	
5.	 Select the topmost layer that you want to blend in the Layers panel 
and then choose Layer➪Create Clipping Mask.
	
	 This command creates a clipping mask. For a detailed explanation of 
clipping masks, see the next section in this chapter.
	
6.	 With the painting tool of your choice (we recommend the Brush tool), 
paint on your layer mask.
	
	 Apply a foreground color of black where you want to hide the portions of 
the topmost layer. Leave the mask white where you want the topmost 
layer to show. Adjust the Opacity setting in the Options bar to paint with 

Creating Clipping Masks

a less-opaque black, which is essen­
tially like painting with gray. The 
higher the Opacity, the darker the 
gray and the more it partially hides 
the topmost layer. If you want sub­
tle blending between layers, use a 
large, feathered brush tip and vary 
your opacity settings accordingly.
	
	 If things start to run amok, just 
choose Edit➪Fill and fill your entire 
layer mask with white to start again.
	
Note that you can also use the Gradient 
tool on the layer mask. Using foreground 
and background colors of white and 
black, you can create a nice transition 
from showing and hiding the layer, as 
shown in Figure 4-8. The darker areas of 
the gradient gradually hide the image, 
whereas the lighter areas gradually 
show the image. For more on gradients, 
see Book V, Chapter 2.
Creating Clipping Masks
In a clipping mask, the bottommost layer (also known as the base layer) 
acts as a mask for the layers above it. The layer or layers above clip to the 
opaque areas of the base layer and don’t show over the transparent areas 
of the base layer.
Creating a clipping mask works well if you want to fill a shape or some type 
with different images on multiple layers.
Using the steps that follow, we created a new document with a white back­
ground. We then used the Custom Shape tool to create a bird shape on a 
second layer. We added two layer styles — a drop shadow and a simple 
inner bevel — to the shape for added dimension, but this step isn’t manda­
tory. We then opened an image of some clouds and then dragged and 
dropped that image onto our composite.
Follow these steps to create your own clipping mask:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open or create an image that has 
several layers.
	
	 To see best how this technique works, try creating a shape layer for 
your base layer. For more on shape layers, see Book V, Chapter 1.

2.	 Arrange your layers so that your base layer is the bottommost layer.
	
	 See Book VI, Chapter 2 for more on rearranging layers.
	
3.	 Hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) and, in the Layers panel, position 
your mouse cursor over the line dividing the base layer and the layer 
above it.
	
	 Your cursor changes to two overlapping circles with a small arrow 
icon. You can also choose Layer➪Create Clipping Mask.
	
4.	 Click your mouse button.
	
	 Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for any remaining layers you want clipped to the 
base layer. Notice how our sky image clips to the base layer (the bird 
shape) in the Layers panel (appears indented).
	
	 Nothing outside the boundaries of the bird shape is visible on the layer in 
the clipping mask, as shown in Figure 4-9. The down-pointing arrow icon 
beside the layer on the Layers panel indicates that the layer is clipped. 
The clipped layers take on the opacity and Blend mode of the base layer.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 4-9: In a clipping mask, layers mask to the opaque areas of a base layer.
	
A couple other tips to keep in mind when working with clipping masks 
include these:
	
✓	To remove a layer from the clipping mask, you can simply Alt-click 
(Option-click on the Mac) the line between the two layers in the Layers 
panel. Or, you can select the layer and choose Layer➪Release Clipping 
Mask. Both commands remove from the clipping group the selected 
layer and any layers above it.
	
✓	You can also apply clipping masks to adjustment and fill layers. If you clip 
between a regular layer and an adjustment layer, or between a regular 
layer and a fill layer, the adjustment or fill layer affects only the pixels of 
the adjacent underlying layer, rather than all the underlying layers.

W
hen it comes to having fun with Elements, 
nothing beats playing with filters and 
effects. Even if you think you have no talent as an 
artist, with a few mouse clicks you can add some 
interesting effects to images.
In this book, we cover using all the filters you 
have available in Elements, fixing files with blem­
ishes, and applying styles and transformations.

F
ilters have a long and glorious history, ranging from performing essen­
tial tasks (such as removing abrasive particles from the oil in your car’s 
engine) to even more important tasks involving the pixels in your images in 
Elements. In both cases, filters (also called plug-ins because they can be 
installed and removed independently) take your pixels and manipulate them 
in both useful and just frivolous and fun ways. They can correct less-than-
perfect images by making them appear sharper or by covering up flaws. Or, 
they can enhance your images by making them appear as though they’re 
painted, tiled, photocopied, or lit by spotlights. The results are 
something to be admired.
This chapter introduces you to the basics of Photoshop’s 
filter facilities and starts you on the road to filter 
proficiency.
Understanding Filter Basics
All filters do a simple thing in a seemingly compli­
cated way. Deep within a filter’s innards is a set of 
instructions that tells Elements what to do with a par­
ticular pixel in an image or selection. Elements applies 
these instructions to every pixel in the relevant area by 
using a process that the pixelheads call convolution (creating a 
form or shape that’s folded or curved in tortuous windings), but 
which we normal humans simply refer to as applying a filter.

414
Understanding Filter Basics
Applying filters
You can apply a filter in three ways:
	
✓	In either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode: From the Filter menu, choose 
your desired filter category and then select a specific filter.
	
✓	In Edit Full mode only: Choose Window➪Effects to open the Effects 
panel. Click the Filters button at the top of the panel. Select your filter 
category from the drop-down list in the upper-right corner of the panel. 
Double-click the thumbnail of your desired filter or drag the filter onto 
your Image window.
	
✓	In either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode: Choose Filter➪Filter Gallery to 
apply one or more filters in a flexible editing environment. The Filter 
Gallery is described in the section “Working in the Filter Gallery,” later in 
this chapter.
	
You can’t apply filters to images that are in Bitmap or Index Color mode. You 
also can’t apply them to type or shape layers. And some filters don’t work 
on images in Grayscale mode. For a refresher on color modes, see Book III, 
Chapter 2.
Corrective and destructive filters
Most digital imagers classify filters into two basic categories:
	
✓	Corrective filters: Usually used to fix problems in an image. They fine-
tune color, add blur, improve sharpness, or remove such nastiness as 
dust and artifacts. Remember, pixels are still being modified; it’s just 
that these filters don’t change the basic look of an image. They just 
improve it a little.
	
	Be sure to check out the important techniques of sharpening and blur­
ring, covered in Book VIII, Chapter 2. Sharpening and blurring are the 
king and queen of the corrective filters.
	
✓	Destructive filters: Tend to obliterate at least some of an image’s origi­
nal detail while they add special effects. They may overlay an image with 
an interesting texture, move around pixels to create brush strokes, or 
distort an image with twists, waves, or zigzags. You can often tell at a 
glance that a destructive filter has been applied to an image: The special 
effect often looks like nothing that exists in real life.
An unaltered image (such as the image on the left in Figure 1-1) can be 
improved by using a corrective filter such as Unsharp Mask (center) or 
changed dramatically with a destructive filter such as Rough Pastels (right).

Single and multistep filters
Whether a filter is corrective or destructive, it falls into one of two camps. 
Here they are:
	
✓	Single-step filters: The easiest 
filters to use, single-step filters 
have no options and use no dialog 
boxes. Just select the filter from 
the menu and watch it do its stuff 
on your image or selection.
	
✓	Multistep filters: Most filters come 
complete with at least one dialog 
box, along with (perhaps) a few lists, 
buttons, and check boxes. And 
almost every multistep filter has 
sliders you can use to adjust the 
intensity of an effect (see Figure 1-2). 
These filters are marked in the 
menus with an ellipsis (a series of 
dots) following their names.
The controls themselves are easy to 
master. The tricky part is figuring out 
what the various parameters you’re

specify various settings before applying 
your filter.

Understanding Filter Basics
using actually do. How does changing brush size affect your image when 
you’re using a brush-stroke filter? What happens when you select a particu­
lar pattern with a texturizing filter? You can read descriptions of how vari­
ous filter controls affect your image, but your best bet is to simply 
experiment until you discover the effects and parameters that work best for 
you. Just be sure that you save a copy of the original image; filters do perma­
nent damage to files — modifying, adding, and deleting pixels.
Reapplying a filter
You can reapply the last filter you worked with — using the same settings — 
by pressing Ctrl+F (Ô+F on the Mac). (It’s also the first command on the 
Filter menu.) You might want to do this to strengthen the effect of a filter on 
a particular image, layer, or selection. Or you simply may want to apply the 
same filter to a succession of images or selections.
To bring up the dialog box for the last filter you applied, press Ctrl+Alt+F 
(Ô+Option+F on the Mac). This shortcut can be very useful when you apply 
a filter and then decide you don’t like the results and want to go back and try 
different settings. After applying the filter, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) to 
undo and then press Ctrl+Alt+F (Ô+Option+F on the Mac) to bring up the fil­
ter’s dialog box. The dialog box opens with the settings you used last time, 
allowing you to make adjustments and then reapply the filter.
Fading a filter
Sometimes, you don’t want the full effect of a filter applied to your image. 
Sometimes, fading a filter a bit softens the effect and makes it look less “digi­
tized,” as shown in Figure 1-3. Here’s what you can do to dial-down a filter:
	
1.	 In Edit Full mode, choose 
Layer➪Duplicate Layer and then 
click OK when the dialog box 
appears.
	
2.	 Make sure your duplicated layer 
is selected in the Layers panel 
and then apply your desired filter 
to the duplicate layer.
	
	 We applied a Palette Knife filter. 
(You’ll find it under the Artistic 
category.)
	
3.	 Use the Blend modes and Opacity 
settings located on the Layers 
panel to merge the filtered layer with the original unfiltered image.

the filtered and unfiltered images.

	 We brought our Opacity down to 65%. If you need more details on work­
ing with layers, see Book VI.
	
4.	 (Optional) With the Eraser tool, selectively erase portions of your fil­
tered image to enable the unfiltered image to show through.
	
	 For example, if you applied a Gaussian Blur filter to soften a harshly lit 
portrait, try erasing the blurred portion that covers the subject’s eyes to 
let the unblurred eyes of the layer below show through. The sharply 
focused eyes provide a natural focal point.
Selectively applying a filter
You don’t need to apply filters to an 
entire image or an entire layer. You can 
achieve some of the best effects when 
you apply a filter to only a portion of 
an image — say, to an object in the 
foreground, but not on the back­
ground. For example, you can blur a 
distracting background so that the per­
son in your image gets due attention. 
Or, as you see in Figure 1-4, we applied 
a Twirl filter to the water, leaving the 
girl unfiltered to avoid that overly 
“Photoshopped” effect. (Not surpris­
ingly, you’ll find Twirl under the 
Distort category.)
Working in the Filter Gallery
When you apply a filter, you may be presented with a huge dialog box. This 
editing window is officially called the Filter Gallery. You can also access it by 
choosing Filter➪Filter Gallery. In the flexible Filter Gallery, you can apply 
multiple filters, delete them, and edit them to your heart’s content. This fea­
ture has made filters more flexible, more user-friendly, and easier to apply.
	
Even when you’re using the Filter Gallery, make a backup copy of your image — 
or at least create a duplicate layer — before you apply filters. Filters change 
the pixels of an image permanently, and when you exit the Filter Gallery, the 
filters that are applied can’t be removed.
Follow these steps to get up-and-running in the Filter Gallery:
	
1.	 In either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode, choose Filter➪Filter Gallery.
	
	 The Filter Gallery dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-5.

4.	 In the rightmost section, specify any settings associated with the filter.
	
	 The preview is updated accordingly.
	
5.	 When you’re happy with the filter, click OK in the top-right corner of 
the dialog box to apply the filter and exit. But if you want to apply 
another filter, leave the dialog box open and proceed to Steps 6–8.

6.	 If you want to apply another filter, click the New Effect Layer button 
at the bottom of the dialog box.
	
	 Clicking this button duplicates the existing filter.
	
7.	 Select your new filter, which then replaces the duplicate in the 
Applied Filters area of the dialog box.
	
	 Elements lists each of the filters you apply to the image in the bottom-
right of the dialog box.
	
8.	 When you’re done, click OK to apply the second filter and exit the dia­
log box.
	
	 You can apply as many filters as you want to your image. But often, less 
is more.
Here are some other helpful tips to keep in mind when you’re using 
the Filter Gallery:
	
✓	To delete an applied filter, select it in the list in the lower right of the 
dialog box and click the Delete Effect Layer button (the trash can icon) 
at the bottom of the dialog box.
	
✓	To edit an applied filter’s settings, select it in the list and make any nec­
essary changes. Click OK to reapply. Although you can edit a particular 
filter’s settings, that edit affects any subsequent filters you’ve added 
after applying that particular filter.
	
✓	You can rearrange the order of the applied filters. Simply select and 
drag the filter up or down within the list.
	
	Rearranging the order of the filters you’re using changes the results of 
applying the filters.
	
✓	To resize the Filter Gallery dialog box, drag the lower-right corner.
	
✓	To hide the Filter menu and provide the maximum real estate for the 
preview box, click the arrow to the left of the OK button.
	
✓	You can choose any of the filters found in the Filter Gallery from the 
Filter menu itself. Choosing a Filter menu filter launches the Filter 
Gallery automatically — but not all filters are available in the Filter 
Gallery. You have to access some of them individually from the Filter 
menu.
	
Filters change the pixels of an image permanently, and after you apply one, 
you can’t remove it. So, be sure that you really like what you’ve done and that 
you have a backup copy of that precious family photo or critical project image.

Having Fun with Filters
Having Fun with Filters
Now that you’re familiar with what filters are, how they’re applied, and how 
they can be modified and toned down, it’s time to experiment and have 
some fun. This is something you can do on your own when you have an hour 
or so and some willing images laying around. Create a composite with multi­
ple layers and apply some filters. Add some different Opacity settings and 
Blend modes and you’ve got yourself a party.
To get your party started, we give you a few tips on a few of our favorite filters.
Correcting camera distortion
If you’ve ever tried to capture a skyscraper or other imposing piece of archi­
tecture in the lens of your camera, you know that it often involves tilting your 
camera and putting your neck in some uncomfortable position. And then, after 
all that, what you end up with is a distorted view of what was an impressive 
building. The Correct Camera Distortion filter fixes the distorted perspective 
created by both vertical and horizontal tilting of the camera. As a bonus, this 
filter also corrects other kinds of distortions caused by lens flaws.
Here’s how to fix those lens issues:
	
1.	 Choose Filter➪Correct Camera Distortion in either Edit Full or Edit 
Quick mode.
	
2.	 In the Correct Camera Distortion dialog box, be sure to select the 
Preview option, as shown in Figure 1-6.

3.	 Specify your correction options:
	
•	 Remove Distortion: Corrects lens barrel, which causes your images to 
appear spherized or bloated. This distortion can occur when you’re 
using wide-angle lenses. It also corrects pincushion distortion, which 
creates images that appear to be pinched in at the center, a flaw 
that’s found when using telephoto or zoom lenses. Slide the slider 
while keeping an eye on the preview. Use the grid as your guide for 
proper alignment.
	
•	 Vignette: Adjusts the amount of lightening or darkening around the 
edges of your photo that you can sometimes get from incorrect lens 
shading. Change the width of the adjustment by specifying a 
Midpoint value. A lower Midpoint value affects more of the image. 
Then, move the Amount slider while viewing the preview.
	
•	 Vertical Perspective: Corrects the distorted perspective created by 
tilting the camera up or down. Again, use the grid to assist in your 
correction. We used the Vertical Perspective to correct the building 
shown in Figure 1-6.
	
•	 Horizontal Perspective: Corrects halos and blurs caused by moving 
the camera (or if your subject can’t sit still). For better results, set 
the angle of movement under the Angle option.
	
•	 Angle: Enables you to rotate the image to compensate for tilting the 
camera. You may also need to tweak the angle slightly after correct­
ing the vertical or horizontal perspective.
	
•	 Edge Extension: When you correct the perspective on your image, 
you may be left with blank areas on your canvas. You can scale your 
image up or down to crop into the image and eliminate these “holes.” 
Note that scaling up results in interpolating your image up to its orig­
inal pixel dimensions. Therefore, if you do this, be sure to start with 
an image that has a high-enough pixel dimension or resolution to 
avoid severe degradation.
	
•	 Show Grid: Shows and hides the grid, as needed. Choose the color of 
your grid lines.
	
•	 Zoom: Zooms in and out for your desired view.
	
4.	 Click OK to apply the correction and close the dialog box.
The Facet filter
The Facet filter breaks up an image by using a posterizing effect. It gathers 
up blocks of pixels that are similar in brightness and converts them to a 
single value, using geometric shapes. (When you posterize an image, you 
reduce it to a very small number of tones.)

422
Having Fun with Filters
The geometric shapes make the image 
look more randomly produced, while 
eliminating much of the banding effect 
you get with conventional posterizing 
filters.
The effects of the Facet filter are subtle 
and best viewed at close range. The 
image in Figure 1-7 originally contained 
some dust, scratches, and a few other 
defects. Instead of retouching them 
one by one, we used Facet.
Facet is a single-step filter, so you 
don’t need to adjust any controls. Just 
choose Filter➪Pixelate➪Facet and 
evaluate your results. You can apply 
the filter multiple times. However, even 
one application smoothes out the pic­
ture and eliminates the worst of the 
artifacts.
If you apply the Facet filter multiple 
times, your image takes on a kind of 
pointillist, stroked look that becomes 
more and more obvious. Using the fil­
ter over and over on the same image 
can yield quite interesting special 
effects.
Getting artsy
Several filters produce great artistic effects. You can find a large collection 
of them in the Artistic, Sketch, and Stylize submenus.
Many users employ these filters to create images that look as if they were 
painted. What those users might not tell you, unless pressed, is that filters 
can make less than best-quality photos look better. These filters can disguise 
a multitude of photographic sins, turning shoebox rejects into pretty decent 
digital transformations.
Try out one of the following artistic filters:
	
✓	Poster Edges: Gives the picture an artsy, poster-like look, but also 
enhances the edges to make the outline of the object appear sharper, as 
shown in Figure 1-8.
Figure 1-7: The Facet filter can simply 
eliminate annoying artifacts or convert 
your image into a “painted” piece.

✓	Rough Pastels: Gives the look of a fine-art piece created with oil pastels.
	
✓	Dry Brush: This filter can add an even more stylistic effect, reducing 
details down to a series of broad strokes.
	
✓	Colored Pencil: This filter crosshatches the edges of your image to cre­
ate a pencil-like effect.
	
✓	Cutout: This effect assembles an image from what looks like cut-out 
paper shapes, which resemble a kid’s art project.
	
✓	Film Grain: This photographic effect diffuses an image with thousands 
of tiny dots that simulate clumps of film grain. (Think of old home 
movies.)
	
✓	Fresco: This effect looks (supposedly) like pigments applied to fresh, 
wet plaster. Okay, we guess . . . if you squint.
	
✓	Paint Daubs: This effect uses smears of color from your choice of a half-
dozen different brush types. Very Jackson Pollock.
	
✓	Plastic Wrap: This filter can produce a wet look, particularly when you 
apply it to a selection and then fade the filter so it doesn’t overpower 
the detail in your image.
	
✓	Watercolor: This nice pastel effect diffuses an image while adding an 
interesting, watery texture.

Stroking your image
The filters under the Brush Strokes submenu try to mimic the appearance of 
art created with pen, brush, airbrush, ink, and paint. Here are a few of our 
favorites:
	
✓	Ink Outlines: Adobe describes this filter as producing the look of a cor­
roded ink drawing, as shown in Figure 1-9.
	
✓	Spatter: This filter generates the look you might get from a sputtering 
airbrush.
	
✓	Accented Edges: Use this filter to make a subject jump out from its back­
ground by emphasizing the edges of all the objects in the picture.

Distorting for fun
With a couple exceptions, the Elements Distortion filters twist, turn, and 
bend your images in surprising ways, turning ordinary objects into wavy 
images, pinched shapes, and bloated spheres.
The first exception? The Diffuse Glow filter distorts images only to the extent 
that it imbues them with a soft, romantic, fuzzy look that can make the 
sharpest image look positively ethereal, as shown in Figure 1-10.
	
Purestock
Figure 1-10: Give your photo a heavenly aura with the Diffuse Glow filter.
The Glass filter can add a glass-block texture or a frosted-glasslike fuzziness 
to your image. Other filters under this submenu produce wavy images, add 
pond ripples, pinch images, or transform them into spheres.
Getting noisy
Noise in images consists of any graininess or texture that occurs, either 
because of the inherent quality of the image or through the editing process. 
Noise filters, such as Add Noise, produce random texture and grain in an 
image. If you’re new to image editing, you might wonder why you’d want to 
add noise to an image in the first place. Wouldn’t it be smarter to remove it? 
Well, sometimes. In practice, you can find a lot of applications that call for a 
little noise here and there:
	
✓	Adding texture: Objects that become too smooth, either because of blur­
ring or other image editing you may have done, often look better when 
you add some noise to give them a texture, as shown in Figure 1-11. This 
technique is particularly useful if one object in an image has been edited, 
smoothed, or blurred more than the other objects in the image.

426
Having Fun with Filters
Figure 1-11: Adding some noise can give an image some needed 
texture.
	
✓	Blending foreign objects into a scene: When you drop a new object into 
the middle of an existing scene, the amount of grain or noise in the new 
object is often quite different from the objects it’s joining.
	
	For example, say you’ve decided to take a photo of your house and want 
to insert a certain luxury car in your driveway. Unfortunately, the photo 
of your in-law’s car is a lot sharper than the picture of your house. 
Adding a little noise can help the two objects blend more realistically. 
You may even forget that the car isn’t yours.
	
✓	Improving image quality: Images that contain smooth gradients often 
don’t print well because some printers can’t reproduce the subtle blend 
of colors from one hue to another. The result is objectionable banding in 
your printed image: You can see distinct stripes where the colors prog­
ress from one to another. Adding a little noise can break up the gradient 
enough that your printer can reproduce the blend of colors, and the 
noise/grain itself is virtually invisible on the printed sheet.
	
The other filters in the Noise submenu don’t add noise at all; instead, they 
make noise and artifacts (flaws, such as the dust and scratches on old film) 
less noticeable.

Breaking your image into pieces
The Pixelate filters break up your images into bits and pieces, providing 
more of those painterly effects you can get with brush strokes and artistic 
filters. The Pixelate submenu includes the Crystallize filter, as shown in 
Figure 1-12, as well as filters that produce color halftone effects, fragmented 
images, and a pointillism effect.
	
Purestock
Figure 1-12: The Crystallize filter breaks your image into polygonal 
shapes.
Rendering
In computer lingo, rendering means creating something from a set of instruc­
tions, in a way. That’s why rendering filters all produce special effects by 
creating a look, object, or lighting effect that’s melded with your original 
image. Here are a few favorite render filters.

✓	Clouds: Enables you to create a sky full of clouds using random values 
taken from a range between the foreground and background colors, as 
shown in Figure 1-13. To create a cloud effect with more contrast, hold 
down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) quickly when choosing the 
command. If you don’t like the first set of clouds you get, apply the filter 
again and again until you do. If you want a more “realistic” sky, try using 
a dark sky blue for your foreground color and a very light blue or white 
color for your background color.

multiple of that size) image and apply the Clouds filter. It tiles seam­
lessly on your Web page.
	
✓	Difference Clouds: Use this filter to create puffy objects in the sky (or 
foggy clouds at lower levels). The Difference Clouds filter uses image 
information to figure the difference in pixel values between the new

clouds and the image they’re joining. The result is a unique cloud effect. 
Try applying the filter repeatedly to create a marbleized effect.
	
✓	Lens Flare: This filter creates the reflection effect that plagues photogra­
phers when they point their cameras toward a strong light source, such 
as the sun. The filter mimics several different kinds of photographic 
lenses, giving you useful flares that can spice up concert photos and add 
a sunset where none existed. Specify a location for the center of the flare 
by clicking the image thumbnail or by dragging the crosshair.
	
✓	Lighting Effects: As a sort of photo-studio lighting setup, this filter uses 
pixels to do its work. You can set up 16 different lights and manipulate 
how they illuminate your photo.
Getting organic with the Sketch filters
If you’ve ever envied people who can crank out a beautiful pen sketch in a 
matter of minutes, this is the filter menu for you. The Sketch submenu 
includes plenty of traditional media artistic effects, such as Graphic Pen (as 
shown in Figure 1-14), Conté Crayon, Note Paper, chalk, charcoal, and so on. 
Here’s a brief rundown of a few effects that aren’t quite so traditional:
	
✓	Photocopy: Gives that infamous, anachronistic look (dating back to the 
days when photocopiers didn’t do a very good job of reproducing half­
tone images). Creates areas of black and white with little gray value 
when the default foreground and background colors of black and white 
are selected.
	
✓	Plaster: Creates a look that resembles molten plastic more than it looks 
like plaster. The filter uses the foreground and background values to 
color the image.
	
✓	Stamp: Mimics a rubber or wooden-block stamp.
	
✓	Reticulation: Adds texture by reproducing a veritable photographic 
disaster — the wrinkling of film emulsion that occurs when you move 
film from one developing chemical to another that has an extremely dif­
ferent temperature (think hot developer followed by a bath in cold 
water). The highlights look grainy; the shadow areas look thick and 
goopy.
	
✓	Torn Edges: Creates the look of ragged paper and colorizes the image 
using the foreground and background colors.
	
✓	Water Paper: Creates the look of paint-like daubs on fibrous, wet paper.

Adding texture
Elements lets you add a lot of interesting textures to your image, such as the 
cracked canvas effect generated by the Craquelure filter (see Figure 1-15) or 
the pixel effect produced by the Patchwork filter.
You can find other filters on this menu to help you create mosaic effects, 
add yet another kind of film grain, and create stained-glass effects in your 
images. But the most versatile filter in this set is surely the Texturizer, which 

431

enables you to apply various kinds of textures to your images or selections, 
including Canvas, Sandstone, Burlap, or Brick.
	
PhotoDisc
Figure 1-15: The Craquelure filter gives an Old World-painting feel to 
your image.
You can select the relative size of the texture compared to the rest of your 
image by using the Scaling slider. You can even select the direction of the 
light source that produces the 3-D look, selecting from top, bottom, either 
side, or any of the four corners of the image.
Putting It Together
Creating an Angelic Glow
Sometimes, a little blur can add a soft, romantic mood or an angelic glow that can 
improve glamour photos, pictures of kids, or even something as mundane as a flower. 
The secret is to apply only enough blurring to provide the soft effect you want without 
completely obliterating your original subject. This assumes, of course, that your subject 
doesn’t deserve obliteration, that the kids are your own (or those of a close friend or rela­
tive), and that they are, in fact, of that rare angelic variety.
You don’t want to use this effect on other subjects, such as men, who generally like a 
rugged, masculine appearance. Many senior citizens regard the age lines on their faces 
as badges of distinction earned over a long, rewarding life. Don’t try softening them up 
with glowing effects, either.

Chapter 2: Distorting with 
the Liquify Command
In This Chapter
✓	Checking out the Liquify window
✓	Understanding the options
✓	Liquifying an image
L
iquify is the only Elements filter that garners a chapter of its own. 
That’s because Liquify is not your run-of-the-mill filter. Truth be told, it 
is the ultimate distortin’ fool, with a bevy of tools, modes, and options that 
make it a good deal more complex than most of its kin on the Filter menu. 
The Liquify filter lets you push and pull on parts of your image, twist, turn, 
and pinch other parts, and bloat and reflect yet others. You can basically 
manipulate an image as though it were pliable saltwater taffy. And although 
this would be worthwhile entertainment on its own, you can actually use the 
Liquify filter to perform some productive tasks. Pick up any fashion maga­
zine and we guarantee you that many of images of models and celebrities 
you see there have made their way through the Liquify filter for nips, 
tucks, and overall body sculpting. Yes, even those blessed with 
natural beauty are given a dose of digital beautification for 
good measure.
Exploring the Liquify Window
At first glance, the Liquify window is a little daunt­
ing. It’s a little daunting on second, third, and 
fourth glances, too. But when you quit glancing and 
dive into this versatile filter, you find that the tools 
and options make a lot of sense.
Open the Liquify window by choosing Filter➪Distort➪
Liquify. The Liquify Tools panel appears on the left, as 
shown in Figure 2-1. The other options available with Liquify 
appear on the right side of the window. The Tools panel 
includes a dozen tools that you can use to paint and distort your 
image.

434
Exploring the Liquify Window
Figure 2-1: The Liquify window is quite user-friendly after you get familiar 
with its tools and settings.
	
As with the main Elements Tools panel, you can activate each tool by press­
ing a keyboard shortcut letter associated with its name.
The distortion painting tools
The first group of tools is used to paint distortions on your image. The fol­
lowing list describes each tool, with its keyboard shortcut in parentheses. 
To see what the tool icon looks like, refer to Figure 2-1. To see what each 
tool does to pixels, check out Figure 2-2.
	
	
✓	Warp (W): This tool is faintly reminiscent of the Smudge tool, but it 
doesn’t obliterate details in the pixels quite as much as it pushes them 
forward while you drag, creating a stretched effect. Use the Warp tool to 
push pixels where you want them to go, using short strokes or long 
pushes. This is the main tool to use when you want to body-sculpt the 
person in an image.
	
	
✓	Turbulence (T): This tool adds a random jumbling effect to pixels when 
you click and hold down the mouse button. It acts similarly to the Warp 
tool when you click and drag. Adjust how smooth the effect is by drag­
ging the Turbulent Jitter slider in the Tool Options area. The higher the 
value, the smoother the effect. You can use the Turbulence tool to cre­
ate maelstroms of air, fire, and water with clouds, flames, and waves.

✓	Twirl Clockwise (R) and Twirl Counterclockwise (L): Place the cursor 
in one spot, press the mouse button, and watch the pixels under your 
brush rotate like a satellite photo of a tropical storm. Or drag the cursor 
to create a moving twirl effect. Pixels move faster in the center than 
along the edges of the brush.

Try this technique with the other tools we describe in this list (with 
some tools, the effect is more obvious than with others). Simply hold 
down the mouse button. The longer you hold it down, the more promi­
nent the effect becomes.
	
	
✓	Pucker (P): This tool is the equivalent of the Pinch filter, squishing pix­
els toward the center of the area covered by the brush while you hold 
down the mouse button or drag. To reverse the pucker direction, which 
essentially applies a bloat, hold down the Alt key (Option key on the 
Mac) while you hold down the mouse button or drag.
	
	
✓	Bloat (B): Think of this tool as a kind of Spherize filter, pushing pixels 
toward the edge of the brush area while you hold down the mouse but­
ton or drag the mouse. To reverse the bloat direction — doing so 
applies a pucker — hold down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) while 
you hold down the mouse button or drag.
	
	
✓	Shift Pixels (S): This odd tool moves pixels to the left when you drag the 
tool straight up. Drag down to move pixels to the right. Drag clockwise to 
increase the size of the object being distorted. Drag counterclockwise to 
decrease the size. To reverse any of the directions, hold down the Alt key 
(Option key on the Mac) while you hold down the mouse button or drag.
	
	
✓	Reflection (M): This tool drags a reversed image of your pixels at a 
90-degree angle to the motion of the brush. Hold down the Alt key 
(Option key on the Mac) to force the reflection in the direction opposite 
the motion of the brush (for example, to the left of a brush moving right, 
or above a brush moving down). This tool is a good choice for making 
reflections on water.
The other tools
The three remaining tools on the panel help with undoing distortions you 
may no longer want and also with navigation. These tools (shown here with 
their keyboard shortcuts) are
	
	
✓	Reconstruct (R): This is a variation on the old standby Undo. It lets you 
reverse or alter — completely or partially — the distortions you’ve 
made. You can retrace your steps if you went overboard in your distor­
tion activities.
	
	
✓	Hand (H): The Hand tool works exactly like the standard Elements Hand 
tool. Click and drag the image to move it around within the Preview win­
dow. You can find more about the Hand tool in Book I, Chapter 2.
	
	
✓	Zoom (Z): This tool works exactly like the Elements Zoom tool, which 
zooms you in and out. Just click the image to zoom in. Hold down the Alt 
key (Option key on the Mac) and click to zoom out. You can also zoom 
by selecting a magnification percentage (from 6 to 1600 percent) from 
the pop-up menu in the lower-left corner of the dialog box. Or, if you like 
buttons, click your way to magnification by using the +/– zoom control 
buttons. See Book I, Chapter 2, for more on using the Zoom tool.

The Options Area
On the right side of the Liquify window (refer to Figure 2-1), you can find 
some menus and buttons that let you specify options for the tools. We point 
them out to you here and cover how to use them in the rest of this chapter:
	
✓	Brush Size: Specifies the width of the brush.
	
✓	Brush Pressure: Specifies the speed at which you distort while you drag. 
The lower the value, the slower the distortion is applied.
	
✓	Turbulent Jitter: Determines how tightly the brush jumbles pixels. 
When you use the Turbulence tool, this option gives the stroke a more 
natural, organic look.
	
✓	Stylus Pressure: If you’re lucky enough to have a graphics tablet and sty­
lus, click this option to select the pressure of the stylus, which then con­
trols the width of your brush stroke.
Distorting an Image with Liquify
Liquify is as easy to apply as finger paint after you play with it a little. Here’s 
a step-by-step scenario of the things you might do to apply some distortion 
to your own image:
	
1.	 Select and open an image you want to transmogrify in the Editor, in 
either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode.
	
2.	 In the Layers panel, select a layer. If you don’t want to distort the 
whole layer, you can select part of it.
	
	 For more on selections, see Book IV. For info on layers, see Book VI.
	
3.	 Choose Filter➪Distort➪Liquify.
	
	 The Liquify dialog box appears with the image in the preview area, as 
shown in Figure 2-3.
	
4.	 Choose a distortion weapon of choice.
	
	 For a detailed description of each tool, see the preceding section, 
“The distortion painting tools.” Figure 2-4 shows you what a little 
Pucker can do. (To visually see what each tool does, take another 
gander at Figure 2-2.)
	
5.	 Specify options in the Tool Options area.
	
	 Remember to adjust the brush size and pressure to get the exact cover­
age you want. For a description of each option, see the preceding sec­
tion, “The Options Area.”

6.	 If you take the distortions a little too far, select the Reconstruct tool to 
partially or fully reverse or modify your distortions.
	
	 Note that the reconstruction occurs faster at the center of the brush’s 
diameter. To partially reconstruct your image, set a low brush pressure 
and watch closely while the mouse drags across the distorted areas.
	
7.	 Apply the distortion to your image by clicking OK and exiting the 
Liquify dialog box.
	
If you mucked up things and want to start again, click the Revert button to 
get the original, unaltered image back. This action also resets the tools to 
their previous settings. Figure 2-5 shows the Before (and the Extreme After)

A
fter you have all the basic elements lined up in your layered compos­
ite image, you may want to give it a little pizzazz. Elements provides a 
lot of different effects that you can apply to enhance your images. Maybe a 
headline would pop out a little more if you beveled the edge, or maybe that 
silhouetted image would take on a little more dimension if you placed a 
drop shadow behind it. This chapter is where you find out how to do all 
these things.
Seeing What the Effects Panel Can Do
Elements has organized all its various effects in one neat 
panel. In the Editor in Edit Full mode, choose Window➪
Effects. On the right side of the application window, 
you see the Effects panel, as shown in Figure 3-1. 
Buttons for the various categories of effects — 
Filters, Layer Styles, and All — are at the top of the 
panel. Subcategories (or libraries) of Filters, Layer 
Styles, and Filters are just to the right, accessible 
via a drop-down list. Individual effects, styles, and 
filters are located in the bottom portion of the panel 
and are displayed by thumbnail and/or name.
Click the down-pointing arrow in the upper-right corner 
(just below the close button) of the Effects panel to 
change the view of your effects, filters, and styles as thumb­
nails or as names. You’ll also find a fast track to Styles and Effects 
help, if you need it.
The upcoming sections explain how to apply photo effects and styles. We go 
into a hefty discussion about filters in Book VII, Chapter 1.

Enhancing with 
Photo Effects
Elements provides a variety of photo 
effects that you can apply to your pho­
tos. Note that some effects automati­
cally create a duplicate of the selected 
layer, whereas other effects work only 
on flattened images. You can’t preview 
how the effect will look on your image 
or type, as you can when you apply 
filters. Also, you have no options to 
specify.
Here are the steps to follow when 
applying a photo effect:
	
1.	 In the Editor in Edit Full mode, 
select your desired image layer in 
the Layers panel.
	
	 Or, if you’re applying the effect to 
only a single a selection, make the 
selection before applying the effect.
	
2.	 Choose Window➪Effects.
	
3.	 In the Effects panel, select the 
Photo Effects button (blue screen 
with white dots around it) at 
the top.
	
	 Refer to Figure 3-1.
	
4.	 Select your desired subcategory, 
or library, of Photo Effects from the drop-down list in the upper-right 
area of the panel:
	
•	 Frame: Includes photo effects that enhance the edges of the layer or 
selection.
	
•	 Faded Photo, Monotone Color, Old Photo, and Vintage Photo: This 
group of photo effects makes your image fade from color to gray­
scale, appear as a single color, or look like an old pencil sketch or a 
photo on old paper.
	
•	 Misc Effects: This group includes a wide variety of effects to make 
your image appear as though it’s snowing, made of lizard skin or 
neon tubes, or painted with oil pastels.
	
•	 Show All: Shows all the photo effects described in this list.

5.	 On the Effects panel, double-click 
an effect or drag the effect onto 
the image.
	
	 In our example, in Figure 3-2, we 
applied the Oil Pastel photo effect 
in the Misc Effects library.
	
You can also apply a photo effect to 
type. Select a type layer in the Layers 
panel and follow Steps 2–5 in the pre­
ceding list. Note that a dialog box alerts 
you that the type layer must be simpli­
fied before the effect can be applied. 
Remember that simplifying the layer 
means the text can no longer be edited, 
so be sure your type is exactly as you 
want it. For more on working with type 
layers, see Book V, Chapter 3.
	
Unlike layer styles, note that photo 
effects can’t be edited. Photo effects 
automatically create another layer, so 
if you don’t care for the effect, simply 
delete that layer by dragging it to the 
trash can at the top of the Layers panel.
Working with layer styles
Layer styles range from simple shadows and bevels to more-complex 
designs, such as buttons and patterns. The wonderful thing about layer 
styles is that they’re completely nondestructive. Unlike filters, layer styles 
don’t change your pixel data. You can edit them or even delete them if 
you’re unhappy with the results, so feel free to use them with abandon.
Here are a few fun facts about layer styles:
	
✓	Layer styles can be applied only to layers. Therefore, if all you have in 
your image is a background, be sure to convert it to a layer first. See 
Book VI for details on working with layers.
	
✓	Layer styles are dynamically linked to the contents of a layer. If you 
move or edit the contents of the layers, the results are updated.
	
✓	When you apply a layer style to a layer, an fx icon appears next to the 
layer’s name on the Layers panel. Double-click the fx icon to bring up 
the Style Settings dialog box and make any adjustments that are neces­
sary to get the look you want.
Figure 3-2: Enhance your images by adding 
photo effects to your image and type layers.

Seeing What the Effects Panel Can Do

✓	Layer styles are stored in different libraries. You can add shadows, 
glows, beveled and embossed edges, and more-complex appearances, 
such as neon, plastic, chrome, and other manmade textures. See 
Figure 3-3 for a layer style sampler.
	
✓	Delete a layer style or styles. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Clear Layer 
Style or drag the fx icon on the Layers panel to the trash can in the panel.
	
✓	Copy and paste layer styles onto other layers. Select the layer contain­
ing the layer style and choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Copy Layer Style. 
Select the layer or layers on which you want to apply the effect and 
choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Paste Layer Style. You can also just drag and 
drop an effect from one layer to another while holding down the Alt key 
(the Option key on the Mac). Note that if you drag and drop an effect 
without holding down the Alt or Option key, you move the layer style 
from one layer to another.

✓	Hide or show layer styles. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Hide All Effects 
or Show All Effects.
	
✓	Scale a layer style. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Scale Effects. Select 
Preview and enter a value between 1 and 1,000 percent. This allows you 
to scale the style without scaling the element.
Here are the steps to apply a style and a description of each of the style 
libraries.
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, select an image or type layer on the 
Layers panel.
	
2.	 Choose Window➪Effects.
	
3.	 Select the Layer Styles button (an icon of two overlapping screens) at 
the top of the Effects panel.
	
	 Refer to Figure 3-1.
	
4.	 Select a library of styles from the drop-down list in the upper-right 
area of the panel:
	
•	 Bevels: Adds a three-dimensional edge on the outside or inside edges 
of the contents of a layer, giving the element some dimension. 
Emboss styles make elements appear as though they’re raised off of 
or punched into the page. You can change the appearance of these 
styles, depending on the type of bevel chosen. Adjust attributes, 
such as the lighting angle, distance (how close the shadow is to the 
layer contents), size, bevel direction, and opacity.
	
•	 Drop and Inner Shadows: Add a soft drop or inner shadow to a layer. 
Choose from an ordinary shadow or one that includes noise, neon, or 
outlines. You can adjust the lighting angle, distance, size, and opac­
ity, as desired.
	
•	 Outer and Inner Glows: Add a soft halo that appears on the outside or 
inside edges of your layer contents. Adjust the appearance of the 
glow by changing the lighting angle, size, and opacity of the glow.
	
•	 Visibility: Click Show, Hide, or Ghosted to display, hide, or partially 
show the layer contents. The layer style remains fully displayed.
	
•	 Complex and others: The remaining layer styles are a group of differ­
ent effects ranging from simple glass buttons to the more exotic 
effects, such as Groovy and Rose Impressions. You can customize all 
these layer styles somewhat by adjusting the various settings, which 
are similar to those for other styles in this list.
	
5.	 On the Effects panel, double-click a layer style or drag the layer style 
onto the image.
	
	 The style, with its default settings, is applied to the layer. Note that layer 
styles are cumulative. You can apply multiple styles — specifically, 
one style from each library — to a single layer.

446
	
	 Note that you can also apply layer styles to type layers, and the type 
layer doesn’t need to be simplified. This is an advantage over Photo 
Effects because it enables you to retain the type’s editability, as shown 
in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4: Layer styles are advantageous because they don’t alter your 
pixels.
Editing layer styles
Layer styles are very agreeable. Not 
only are they easy to apply, they are 
equally easy to edit. Here’s how:
	
1.	 In the Layers panel, double-click 
the fx icon on the layer.
	
	 The Style Settings dialog box 
opens, as shown in Figure 3-5.
	
2.	 Be sure to check Preview so you 
can view how your edits are 
affecting the layer style.
	
3.	 Expand the options for any layer 
style category by clicking the 
arrow just to the left of the layer 
style name.
	
	 Note that you can toggle the layer 
style on and off by checking and 
unchecking the style.
	
4.	 Depending on what category of 
layer styles you use, you have 
various options you can specify.
	
	 Here’s a rundown:
	
•	 Lighting Angle: Specify the angle 
of your light source. If you’ve 
decided to put together a 
Figure 3-5: Layer styles such as shadows are 
live, enabling you to edit them at any time.

realistic composite of a number of different images, make sure that 
all the shadows and highlights of all the different elements are con­
sistent. You don’t want one layer to look like it’s 6 a.m. and another 
to look like it’s 2 p.m.
	
•	 Size: Specify the size of your shadow, glow, bevel, or stroke from 0 to 
250 pixels.
	
•	 Distance: Adjust how far the shadow or glow is offset (0 to 30000 pix­
els) from your element.
	
•	 Opacity: Adjust the Opacity setting to change how transparent the 
shadow, glow, or stroke appears — from 0% to 100%.
	
•	 Inner/Outer: Specify whether your glow is an inner or outer glow.
	
•	 Color: Click the color swatch and choose a glow color from the Color 
Picker. Click OK to close the Color Picker dialog box.
	
•	 Direction Up/Direction Down: Specify whether your bevel (the raised 
or sunken-in edge) direction is up or down. Direction Up positions 
the highlight along the edge closest to the light source and the 
shadow on the opposite edge. Direction Down does the opposite, 
positioning the shadow near the light source.
	
5.	 After you refine your layer style settings, click OK.
	
	 The layer style is edited and ready to go, as shown in Figure 3-6. Note that 
there are also options for Reset, to start over; or Cancel, to bail out entirely.

Retouching and

A
lmost every photo you take needs a little 
polish before you share or print it. In this 
book, we talk about the automated features in 
Elements that help you quickly adjust brightness 
and color, and we cover many advanced image-
correction features.
If you have some photos that were taken with poor 
lighting, have low contrast, or are a little bit fuzzy, 
this book can help you resurrect some images you 
thought were destined for the waste bin.

O
ne of the strongest assets of Elements is the capability to fix images 
quickly, painlessly, and effectively. When you work with digital imag­
ing, you find that cropping away unwanted clutter, cloning an image with a 
shadow, adjusting the color or contrast of a photo, or eliminating flaws from 
that otherwise perfect portrait are all fixes that you can do successfully 
whatever your skill level. With these simple image-makeover tools, Elements 
makes these tasks as easy to perform as clicking a button or making a few 
swipes with a brush.
Cropping an Image
Even a novice photographer knows that cropping an 
image can make a composition stronger. Cropping 
cuts away background clutter or empty space in 
order to focus in on a certain subject.
This simple process can transform a mediocre 
image into an interesting and even exciting one. 
Take a look at our example in Figure 1-1. It doesn’t 
take a pro photographer to figure out which image is 
better composed.

Cropping an Image
454
Figure 1-1: Cropping is one of the easiest ways to improve the composition 
of your image.
Cutting away with the Crop tool
The most popular way to crop an image is by using the Crop tool. This simple 
tool is as easy and effective to use as a ruler and an X-Acto knife — without 
the possibility of slicing any fingers. Here’s how to use this popular tool:
	
	 1.	 In the Editor, in either Edit Quick or Edit Full mode, select the Crop 
tool. Or you can press the C key.

2.	 Specify your aspect ratio options on the Options bar.
	
	 Here are your choices:
	
•	 No Restriction: Allows you to freely crop the image at any size.
	
•	 Use Photo Ratio: Retains the original aspect ratio of the image when 
you crop.
	
•	 Preset Sizes: Offers a variety of common photographic sizes. When 
you crop, your image assumes those specific dimensions.
	
	
	 When you crop an image, Elements retains the original resolution of 
the file. Therefore, to keep the image at the same resolution while 
also eliminating portions of the image, Elements must resample the 
file. Consequently, your image must have sufficient resolution so that 
the effects of the resampling aren’t too noticeable. This is especially 
true if you’re choosing a larger preset size. Be sure to see Book III, 
Chapter 1 for more details on resolution.
	
•	 Width and Height: Enables you to specify a width and height to crop 
your image.
	
3.	 With the Crop tool, click and drag around the part of the image you 
want to keep and then release your mouse button.
	
	 While you drag, a marquee (a dotted outline) bounding box appears, 
displaying the cropping boundaries. Don’t worry if your cropping mar­
quee isn’t exactly correct. You can adjust it in Step 4.
	
	 The area outside the cropping marquee appears darker than the inside 
in order to frame your image better. Adobe calls this a shield. If you want 
to change the color and opacity of the shield, or if you don’t want it at 
all, change your Crop preferences. (Choose Edit➪Preferences➪Display 
& Cursors; on the Mac, choose Photoshop Elements➪Preferences➪
Display & Cursors.)
	
	 Figure 1-2 shows a great example of way too much background clutter. 
We dragged around the only thing we wanted to retain.
	
4.	 Adjust the cropping marquee by dragging the handles of the crop mar­
quee bounding box.
	
	 The small squares on the sides and corners of the cropping marquee are 
called handles. When you hover your mouse pointer over any handle or 
over the marquee itself, your cursor changes to a double-headed arrow, 
indicating that you can drag.
	
	 To move the entire marquee, position your mouse pointer inside the 
marquee until you see a black arrowhead cursor and then drag. Adjust 
the marquee until you’re satisfied.
	
	 You can also drag the origin point (the circle icon in the center) to 
change the axis of rotation.

Figure 1-2: The area around your cropping marquee appears darker so that you can better 
frame your image.
	
	 If you move your mouse outside the marquee, the cursor changes to a 
curved, double-headed arrow. Dragging with this cursor rotates the mar­
quee. This feature can be extremely useful to rotate and crop a crooked 
image. By using the Crop tool, you can perform both commands in one 
step, quickly and accurately. Just be aware that rotation, unless it’s in 
90-degree increments, resamples your image. If this is done repeatedly, it 
can damage your image. Getting the rotation right the first time is best.
	
5.	 Double-click inside the cropping marquee.
	
	 You can also just press Enter (Return on the Mac) or click the green 
Commit button next to the marquee. Elements then discards the area 
outside the marquee, as shown in Figure 1-3. To cancel your crop, click 
the red Cancel button or press the Esc key.
Cropping with a selection border
If you get bored using the Crop tool, you can also crop a selected area by 
choosing Image➪Crop in either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode. Simply make a

selection with any of the tools and then choose this command. Although it 
makes the most sense to use the Rectangular Marquee tool for your selection, 
you don’t have to.
Figure 1-3: Eliminating background clutter allows you to home in on your subject.
You can choose Image➪Crop with any selection — round, polygonal, free-
form, even feathered. Elements can’t crop to those odd shapes, but it gets as 
close to the outline as it can, as shown in Figure 1-4.
Figure 1-4: Elements can crop to any selection border shape.

Straightening Images
458
Straightening Images
Strive to capture a straight horizon in your photo. You don’t want people to 
feel like the water is going to pour right out of your frame in that shot of the 
beach or sailboat. Or, maybe when you scanned a photo, it wasn’t quite cen­
tered in the middle of the scanning bed. No worries. Elements gives you sev­
eral ways to straighten an image.
Using the Straighten tool
This tool enables you to specify a new straight edge, and it then rotates the 
image accordingly. Here’s how to use the Straighten tool:
	
	 1.	 With the Editor in Edit Full mode, select the Straighten tool from the 
Tools panel (or press the P key).
	
2.	 Specify your desired setting from the Canvas Options on the Options bar.
	
	 Here are your choices:
	
•	 Grow or Shrink Canvas to Fit: Rotates the image and increases or 
decreases the size of the canvas to fit the image area.
	
•	 Crop to Remove Background: Trims off background canvas outside 
the image area. This is helpful if you want to remove white areas that 
appear around an image when you scan it.
	
•	 Crop to Original Size: Rotates your image without trimming any back­
ground canvas.
	
3.	 (Optional) Select Rotate All Layers.
	
	 If you have an image with layers and you want them all them rotated, 
select this option.
	
4.	 Using the Straighten tool, draw a line in your image to represent the 
new straight edge, as shown in Figure 1-5.
	
	 Your image is then straightened and, if you chose either of the crop 
options in Step 2, also cropped.
Using the Straighten menu commands
In addition to using the Straighten tool, you can straighten your images by 
using two commands on the Image menu, in either Edit Full or Edit Quick 
mode:

vas around the image.
	
✓	To automatically straighten and crop the image simultaneously: 
Choose Image➪Rotate➪Straighten and Crop Image.
	
Figure 1-5: Straighten your image.
Using the Divide Scanned Photos Command
The Divide Scanned Photos command is fabulous if you want to save time by 
scanning multiple images initially into one document (and the command 
works on single images as well). This command is a real manual-labor time­
saver, and we endorse it. Position all the photos you can on your scanning 
bed and get one initial scan. Just make sure that a clear separation exists 
between images. Then choose Image➪Divide Scanned Photos in either Edit 
Full or Edit Quick mode. Elements divides the images and places each one in 
a separate file, as shown in Figure 1-6. Note that if you have images with a lot 
of white in them, such as snow, you should cover the scanner with a piece of 
dark paper to better delineate the boundaries of each image. Conversely, for 
scanners with a black background and scanning photos with a lot of black, 
cover the scanner with a piece of light paper.

Figure 1-6: The Divide Scanned Photos command extracts and straightens your images into 
separate files.
Applying One-Step Auto Fixes
Elements has five automatic lighting-, contrast-, and color-correction tools 
that can quickly improve the look of your images with a single menu com­
mand. These commands are available in either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode, 
and they’re all on the Enhance menu.
What’s great about these auto fixes is that they’re very easy to use. You 
don’t need to know a heck of a lot about color or contrast to use them. The 
not-so-good news is that sometimes the result of these auto fixes isn’t as 
good as you could get via a manual color-correction method. And sometimes 
these fixes may even make your image look worse than before by giving you 
strange shifts in color. But because these correctors are quick and easy — 
and easily undone — they’re worth a try. Usually you don’t want to apply 
more than one of the auto fixes. If one doesn’t work on your image, just 
remember you can undo the fix and try another. If you still don’t like the

result, move on to one of the manual methods that we describe in Book VIII, 
Chapter 2.
Auto Smart Fix
This all-in-one command attempts to adjust it all. It’s designed to improve 
lighting, improve the details in shadow and highlight areas, and correct the 
color balance, as shown in Figure 1-7. The overexposed image on the left was 
improved with the Auto Smart Fix command.
Figure 1-7: Apply the Auto Smart Fix command to quickly improve an image overall.
	
For Windows users, the Auto Smart Fix command, as well as the Auto Color, 
Auto Levels, Auto Contrast, Auto Sharpen, and Auto Red Eye Fix, are avail­
able in the Organizer (under the Fix pane), where you can apply the com­
mands to several selected images simultaneously.
If the Auto Smart Fix didn’t quite cut it, you can ramp it up and try Adjust 
Smart Fix. This command is similar to Auto Smart Fix, but gives you a slider 
that allows you to control the amount of correction applied to the image.
Auto Levels
The Auto Levels command adjusts the overall contrast of an image. This 
command works best on images that have pretty good contrast (detail in the 
shadow, highlight, and midtone areas) to begin with and just need a little 
adjustment, but it can also work wonders for seemingly unsalvageable 
images, as shown in Figure 1-8. Auto Levels works by mapping, or convert­
ing, the lightest and darkest pixels in your image to black and white, which 
makes highlights appear lighter and shadows appear darker.

462
Applying One-Step Auto Fixes
462
Figure 1-8: Auto Levels adjusts the overall contrast of an image.
	
Although Auto Levels can improve your contrast, it may also produce an 
unwanted colorcast (a slight trace of color). If this happens, undo the com­
mand and try the Auto Contrast command instead. If that still doesn’t 
improve the contrast, try the Levels command that we describe in Book VIII, 
Chapter 2.
Auto Contrast
The Auto Contrast command is designed to adjust the overall contrast in an 
image without adjusting its color. This command may not do as good a job of 
improving contrast as the Auto Levels command, but it does a better job of 
retaining the color balance of an image. Auto Contrast usually doesn’t cause 
the strange colorcasts that can occur when you’re using Auto Levels. This 
command works really well on images with a haze, as shown in Figure 1-9.
Figure 1-9: The Auto Contrast command clears up hazy images.

Auto Color Correction
The Auto Color Correction command adjusts both the color and contrast of 
an image, based on the shadows, midtones, and highlights it finds in the 
image and a default set of values. These values adjust the number of black 
and white pixels that Elements removes from the darkest and lightest areas 
of the image. You usually use this command to remove a colorcast or to bal­
ance the color in your image, as shown in Figure 1-10. Sometimes this com­
mand can be useful in correcting oversaturated or undersaturated colors.
Figure 1-10: Use Auto Color Correction to remove a colorcast.
Auto Sharpen
Sometimes photos taken with a digital camera or scanned on a flatbed scan­
ner can appear soft, meaning slightly out of focus. Sharpening gives the illu­
sion of increased focus by increasing the contrast between pixels. Auto 
Sharpen attempts to improve the focus, as shown in Figure 1-11, without 
going too far. What happens when you oversharpen? Your images go from 
soft to grainy and noisy. Always make sharpening the last fix after you make 
all other fixes and enhancements. You don’t want to sharpen nasty flaws and 
make them even more noticeable than they already are. For more accurate 
sharpening methods, see the Unsharp Mask and Adjust Sharpness features 
discussed in Book VIII, Chapter 2.

Figure 1-11: Use Auto Sharpen to improve focus.
Auto Red Eye Fix
The Auto Red Eye Fix command automatically detects and eliminates red 
eye in an image. Red eye occurs when a person or animal (where a red eye 
can also be a yellow, green, or even blue eye) looks directly into the flash. 
Many cameras have a red-eye prevention mode, which is a pre-flash that 
causes the subjects’ irises to contract, making their pupils smaller when the 
real flash goes off. Other cameras mount the flash high or to side of the lens, 
which also minimizes the chance of red eye. However, these preventive 
measures are of little solace when you have a great picture that features 
bright red pupils as its dominant feature.
Using the Red Eye Removal tool
If for some reason the Auto Red Eye Fix doesn’t correct the problem, you 
can always try the Red Eye Removal tool on the Tools panel. Here’s how to 
remove red eye manually:
	
	 1.	 Select the Red Eye Removal tool from the Tools panel in the Editor in 
Edit Full mode.
	
	 Note that this tool is also available in Edit Quick mode.
	
2.	 Using the default settings, click the red portion of the eye in your

Figure 1-12: The Auto Red Eye Fix and the Red Eye Removal tool detect
and destroy dreaded red eye.
	
3.	 If you’re unhappy with the fix, adjust one or both of these options:
	
•	 Pupil Size: Use the slider to increase or decrease the size of the pupil.
	
•	 Darken Pupil: Use the slider to darken or lighten the color of the pupil.
	
	 If all goes well, your image is now cured of the dreaded red eye. (Refer to 
the image on the right in Figure 1-12.)
	
Note that you also use the Brush tool with a Color blend mode and paint 
away the red. Or you can use the Color Replacement tool with a black fore­
ground to color away the crimson. If you’re trying to fix green eye in animals, 
your best bet is to use the Color Replacement tool.
Editing with Edit Quick Mode
It turns out that if you master the auto fixes we cover in the previous sec­
tions while working in Edit Quick mode, you probably already have all the 
tools you need to repair and enhance your images. This means you rarely 
have to visit Edit Full mode. Given the power and flexibility of Edit Quick 
mode, then, we’re going to devote an entire section to it.
As you’ve probably already figured out by now, Edit Quick mode is a pared-
down version of Edit Full mode that provides basic image-correcting tools 
and throws in a few unique features — such as a before-and-after preview of 
your image — for good measure. To get a general idea how Edit Quick mode 
works, take a look at the following step-by-step workflow, which shows you 
how you’d put Edit Quick mode to use to fix your photos:
	
1.	 Do one of the following:
	
•	 In the Organizer (for Windows users), select one or more photos. 
Click Fix in the upper-right of the Application window and then click 
the Edit Quick button in the panel below.

466
Editing with Edit Quick Mode

•	 Windows or Mac users, in Edit Full mode, select your desired 
image(s) from the Photo Bin. Click the Quick button in the upper-
right area of the Application window.
	
•	 Windows or Mac users, in Edit Full mode, open your desired images 
by choosing File➪Open. Click the Quick button in the upper-right 
area of the Application window.
	
2.	 Specify your preview preference from the View pop-up menu at the 
bottom of the Application window.
	
	 You can choose to view just your original image (Before Only), your 
fixed image (After Only), or both images side by side (Before & After) in 
either portrait (Vertical) or landscape (Horizontal) orientation, as 
shown in Figure 1-13.
Figure 1-13: Edit Quick mode enables you to view before-and-after previews of your image.
	
3.	 Use the Zoom and Hand tools to magnify and navigate around your 
image.
	
	 You can also specify the Zoom percentage by using the Zoom slider at 
the bottom of the Application window.
	
4.	 Crop your image by using the Crop tool on the Tools panel.
	
	 You can also use any of the methods we describe in the “Cropping an 
Image” section, earlier in this chapter.
	
5.	 To rotate the image in 90-degree increments, click the Rotate Left or 
Rotate Right button at the bottom of the Application window.

6.	 Use the Auto Red Eye Fix to remove the red from your subjects’ eyes.
	
	 Automatically fix red eye by clicking the Auto button under Red Eye Fix 
in the General Fixes pane on the Edit tab in the Panel Bin on the right 
side of the Application window. If that doesn’t work, try the Red Eye 
Removal tool located in the Tools panel.
	
7.	 Apply any necessary auto fixes, such as Auto Smart Fix, Auto Levels, 
Auto Contrast, and Auto Color Correction.
	
	 All these commands are under the Enhance menu or in the General 
Fixes, Lighting, and Color panes on the Edit tab in the Panel Bin on the 
right side of the Application window.
	
	 Each of these fixes is described in the section “Applying One-Step Auto 
Fixes,” earlier in this chapter. Remember that usually one of the fixes is 
enough. Don’t stack them on top of each other. If one doesn’t work, click 
the Reset button in the top-right of the image preview and try another. 
If you’re not happy, go to Step 8. If you are happy, skip to Step 9.
	
8.	 If the auto fixes don’t quite cut it, gain more control by using the 
sliders available for Smart Fix, Levels, Contrast, and Color, located in 
the various panes on the Edit tab in the Panel Bin on the right of the 
Application window.
	
	 Here’s a brief description of each available adjustment:
	
•	 Lighten Shadows: When you drag the slider to the right, the darker 
areas of your image lighten without adjusting the highlights.
	
•	 Darken Highlights: When you drag the slider to the right, the lighter 
areas of your image darken without adjusting the shadows.
	
•	 Midtone Contrast: Adjusts the contrast of the middle (gray) values 
and leaves the highlights and shadows as they are.
	
•	 Saturation: Adjusts the intensity of the colors.
	
•	 Hue: Changes all colors in an image. Make a selection first to change 
the color of just one or more elements. Otherwise use restraint with 
this adjustment.
	
•	 Temperature: Adjusts the colors to make them warmer (red) or 
cooler (blue). This adjustment can be used to correct skin tones or 
to correct overly cool images (such as snowy winter photos) or 
overly warm images (such as photos shot at sunset or sunrise).
	
•	 Tint: Adjusts the tint after you adjust temperature to make the color 
more green or magenta.
	
	 If you still don’t get the results you need, move on to one of the more 
manual adjustments that we describe in Book VIII, Chapter 2.
	
	 You can always apply fixes to just selected portions of your image. Edit 
Quick mode offers the Quick Selection tool for your selection tasks. For 
details on using this tool, see Book IV, Chapter 1.

9.	 Add final fixes by using the remaining tools in the Tools panel.
	
	 Note that all tools that were previously located in the Touch Up pane 
have been relocated to the Tools panel. The Touch Up pane is history.
	
	 Here’s a quick description of each tool:
	
•	 Red Eye Removal tool: If the Auto Red Eye Fix didn’t work, try using 
this tool, described in the section “Auto Red Eye Fix,” earlier in this 
chapter.
	
•	 Whiten Teeth: This new digital fix whitens teeth at a fraction of the 
cost of the real analog procedure. Choose an appropriate brush size 
from the Brushes drop-down panel before whitening (for more on 
brush options, see Book V, Chapter 1). Using a brush diameter that’s 
larger than the area of the teeth also whitens/brightens whatever 
else it touches — lips, chin, and so on. Click the teeth. Note that this 
tool makes a selection and whitens simultaneously. After your initial 
click, your selection option converts from New Selection to Add to 
Selection in the Options bar. If you pick up too much in your dental 
selection, click the Subtract from Selection option and click the area 
you want to eliminate. When you’re happy with the results of your 
whitening session, choose Select➪Deselect or press Ctrl+D (Ô+D on 
the Mac).
	
•	 Make Dull Skies Blue: Click or drag over areas of your sky that need 
brightening. Choosing a brush size and selection option is similar to 
using the Whiten Teeth fix, described in the preceding bullet. When 
you click your sky, it’s selected and brightened at the same time. 
When you’re done, choose Select➪Deselect or press Ctrl+D (Ô+D on 
the Mac).
	
•	 Black and White–High Contrast: This tool converts your image into a 
high-contrast grayscale image. The method and options are similar 
to those for the Whiten Teeth and Make Dull Skies Blue options, 
described in the preceding bullets.
	
	
You can find these same fixes (and many more) in Edit Full mode, under 
the Smart Brush and Detail Smart Brush tools. Check out Book VIII, 
Chapter 2 for the lowdown on these tools.
	
10.	 Sharpen your image either automatically (by clicking the Auto button) 
or manually (by dragging the slider on the Sharpen panel).
	
	 This fix should always be the last adjustment you make on your image. 
Sharpening increases contrast, so you want to fix the flaws first so you 
don’t exacerbate them by making them more noticeable.

Cloning with the Clone Stamp Tool
Say that you want to duplicate an element in your image. That’s easy 
enough, right? Make a selection and copy and paste it into the new location. 
That works fine most of the time. But what if the element has a shadow 
behind it, next to it, above it, or below it? You face the dilemma of having a 
hard edge on the copied element because the shadow (called a cast shadow) 
is cut off by the selection outline. You could feather the selection, but then 
you have to make sure that the copied element blends realistically with the 
background. What a pain. The better method is to clone the element by 
using the Clone Stamp tool. It’s quick, easy, and no one will know that only 
one element was there originally.
Believe it or not, you can also reach for this tool when retouching imperfec­
tions such as scratches, scars, bruises, date/time stamp imprints from 
cameras, and other minor flaws. In fact, that used to be one of its major 
functions. In some retouching instances, it does a decent job, although the 
arrival of the Healing Brush and Spot Healing tools has relegated the Clone 
Stamp tool more to the pure cloning functions and less to the hard-core 
retouching jobs.
The Clone Stamp tool works by taking sampled pixels from one area and 
cloning (or copying) them onto another area. Follow these steps to clone an 
element without any genetic engineering:
	
	 1.	 Open an image and choose the Clone Stamp tool from the Tools panel 
in Edit Full mode.
	
2.	 On the Options bar, choose a brush from the Brush Preset drop-down 
list, and then use the brush as is or adjust its size with the Size slider.
	
3.	 Select the blend mode of your choice in the Options bar.
	
	 Selecting a mode such as Difference, Multiply, or Color can produce 
some interesting special effects. For info on blend modes, see Book VI, 
Chapter 3.
	
4.	 To make the clone more or less opaque, use the Opacity slider or text 
box on the Options bar.
	
	 To make your cloned image appear ghosted, use an opacity setting of 
less than 100 percent.
	
5.	 Specify how fast the Clone Stamp tool applies the clone by adjusting 
the Flow Rate percentage.
	
	 Again, we left our option at 100%.

Cloning with the Clone Stamp Tool

6.	 Select or deselect the Aligned option, depending on your preference.
	
	 With Aligned selected, the clone source moves when you move your 
cursor to a different location. If you want to clone multiple times from 
the same location, deselect the Aligned option.
	
7.	 Select or deselect the All Layers option.
	
	 This option enables you to sample pixels from all visible layers for the 
clone. If this option is deselected, the Clone Stamp tool clones from only 
the active layer. Check out Book VI for details about working with layers.
	
8.	 Alt-click (Option-click on the Mac) the area of your image that you 
want to clone to define the source of the clone.
	
9.	 Click or drag along the area where you want the clone to appear, as 
shown in Figure 1-14.
	
	 While you drag, Elements displays a crosshair cursor along with your 
Clone Stamp cursor. The crosshair represents the source you’re cloning 
from, and the Clone Stamp cursor shows where the clone is being 
applied. While you move the mouse, the crosshair moves as well. This 
provides a continuous reference to the area of your image that you’re 
cloning. Keep an eye on the crosshair, or you may clone something you 
don’t want.
	
	 When you successfully complete the cloning process, you have two 
identical objects. Figure 1-15 shows our identical apples.
Figure 1-14: When using the Clone Stamp tool, drag along the area where 
you want your clone to appear.

Figure 1-15: Our twin apples are the products of cloning.
	
	 If you’re cloning an element, try to clone it without lifting your mouse. 
Also, when you’re retouching a flaw, try not to overdo it. Clicking once 
or twice on each flaw is usually plenty. If you’re heavy-handed with the 
Clone Stamp, you get a blotchy effect that’s a telltale sign something has 
been retouched.
	
10.	 Save the image and close it.
Here are a few additional tidbits regarding the Clone Stamp tool:
	
✓	Use the Clone Stamp tool to fix simple flaws. To clean up a flaw that’s 
pretty straight, such as a stray hair or scratch, Alt-click (Option-click on 
the Mac) with the tool to define the source. Then click at one end of the 
straight flaw and Shift-click at the other end. The cloned source pixels 
cover up the flaw.
	
✓	Pay attention to the origin point for sampling. Depending on what 
you’re cloning (for example, when covering up a flaw), if you keep sam­
pling from the same point without ever varying it, the area you’re clon­
ing starts to look like ugly shag carpeting. Or, at best, it starts to appear 
blotchy and over-retouched.
	
✓	Zoom out once in a while to check how your image looks overall. 
Doing so helps you avoid those funky telltale clone-stamp repetitive 
patterns and blotches.

Cosmetic Surgery with the Healing Brush Tool
The Healing Brush tool is similar to the Clone Stamp tool. Both tools let you 
clone pixels from one area and apply them to another area. But that’s where 
the similarities end, and the Healing Brush leaves the Clone Stamp tool 
in the dust.
The problem with the Clone Stamp tool is that it doesn’t take the tonality of the 
flawed area — the shadows, midtones, and highlights — into consideration. So, 
if the pixels you’re sampling from aren’t shaded and lit exactly like the ones 
you’re covering, you have a mismatch in color, which makes seamless and 
indecipherable repairs hard to achieve.
That’s where the Healing Brush tool comes in. This very intelligent tool clones 
by using the texture from the sampled area (the source) and then using the 
colors around the brush stroke when you paint over the flawed area (the 
destination). The highlights, midtones, and shadows remain intact, and the 
result of the repair is more realistic and natural — not blotchy, miscolored, 
and screaming “retouched.” Follow these steps to heal your favorite, but 
imperfect, photo:
	
	 1.	 Open an image in need of a makeover and select the Healing Brush 
tool from the Tools panel in the 
Editor in Edit Full mode.
	
	 Our guy, as shown in Figure 1-16, 
looks like he could stand to get 
some “work done,” as they say in 
Hollywood. Note that you can also 
heal between two images. Just 
make sure that they have the same 
color mode — for example, both 
RGB (red, green, blue).
	
2.	 On the Options bar, click the 
Brush Preset Picker.
	
	 In the drop-down panel, select 
your desired diameter and hard­
ness, as well as spacing, angle, and 
roundness if you want, for your 
brush tip. You’ll most likely specify 
your brush settings several times 
while retouching your image. Using 
the appropriate brush size for the 
flaw you’re repairing is important.

3.	 Specify a diameter and hardness for your brush tip from the Brush 
Picker drop-down panel on the Options bar.
	
	 You can also adjust the spacing, angle, and roundness. For details on 
these options, see Book V, Chapter 1. Be sure to adjust the size of your 
brush, as needed. Using the appropriate brush size for the flaw you’re 
retouching is crucial for creating realism.
	
4.	 Choose your desired Blend mode.
	
	 You can change your Blend mode, if necessary. The Replace mode pre­
serves textures, such as noise or film grain, around the edges of your 
strokes when you’re using a soft brush. For most simple retouching jobs, 
such as this one, you can leave it at Normal.
	
5.	 Choose one of these Source options:
	
	 You have a choice between Sampled and Pattern:
	
•	 Sampled: Uses the pixels from the image. You’ll probably use this 
option 99.9 percent of the time.
	
•	 Pattern: Uses pixels from a pattern you select from the Pattern Picker 
drop-down panel.
	
	 For our example, we’re sticking with Sampled because we don’t think 
our guy would look that good with a Tie-Dye pattern across his face.
	
6.	 Select or deselect the Aligned option on the Options bar.
	
	 For most retouching tasks, you probably should leave Aligned selected. 
Here are the details on each option:
	
•	 With Aligned selected: When you click or drag with the Healing Brush, 
Elements displays a crosshair along with the Healing Brush cursor. 
The crosshair represents the sampling point, also known as the 
source. When you move the Healing Brush tool, the crosshair also 
moves, providing a constant reference to the area you’re sampling. 
(We left the Aligned option selected in our example.)
	
•	 With Aligned deselected: Elements applies the source pixels from 
your initial sampling point, no matter how many times you stop and 
start dragging.
	
7.	 Select the All Layers option to heal an image by using all visible layers.
	
	 If this option is deselected, you heal from only the active layer.
	
	 To ensure maximum editing flexibility later, select the Sample All Layers 
option and add a new, blank layer above the image you want to heal. 
When you heal the image, the pixels appear on the new layer and not on 
the image itself. You can then adjust opacity, Blend modes, and make 
other tweaks to the “healed” pixels.

8.	 Establish the sampling point by 
Alt-clicking (Option-clicking on 
the Mac).
	
	 Make sure to click the area of your 
image you want to clone from.
	
	 In our example, we clicked the 
smooth area on the chin and 
portions of the forehead.
	
9.	 Release the Alt (Option on the 
Mac) key and click or drag over a 
flawed area of your image.
	
	 Pay attention to where the cross­
hair is located because that’s the 
area you’re healing from. We 
brushed over the wrinkles under 
and around the eyes and on the 
forehead. This guy never looked so 
good, as shown in Figure 1-17, and 
he experienced absolutely no 
recovery time.
Zeroing In with the Spot Healing Brush
Whereas the Healing Brush is designed to fix larger flawed areas, the Spot 
Healing Brush is designed for smaller blemishes and little imperfections. The 
biggest difference between the Healing Brush and the Spot Healing Brush is 
that the Spot Healing Brush doesn’t require you to specify a sampling 
source. It automatically takes a sample from around the area to be 
retouched. The good news is it’s quick and easy. The downside is that it 
doesn’t give you as much control over the sampling source. Consequently, 
reserve this tool for small and simple flaws.
Follow these steps to quickly fix little, nitpicky imperfections with the Spot 
Healing Brush tool:
	
	 1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open your image and grab the Spot 
Healing Brush tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 The moles around this guy’s mouth, as shown in Figure 1-18 on the left, 
are no match for the power of the Spot Healing Brush.
	
2.	 On the Options bar, click the Brush Preset Picker and select your 
desired diameter, hardness, and other options for your brush tip from 
the drop-down panel.
	
	 Try to select a brush that’s a little larger than the flawed area you want 
to fix.

•	 Proximity Match: Samples the pixels around the edge of the selection 
to use to fix the flawed area
	
•	 Create Texture: Uses all the pixels in the selection to create a texture 
to fix the flaw
	
	 Try Proximity Match first and, if it doesn’t work, undo and try Create 
Texture.
	
5.	 Choose Sample All Layers to heal an image by using all visible layers.
	
	 If you leave this option unselected, you heal from only the active layer.
	
6.	 Click, or click and drag, the area you want to fix.
	
	 In Figure 1-18, we used the Spot Healing Brush for the moles and spots 
on the face.
Colorizing with the Color Replacement Tool
The Color Replacement tool allows you to replace the original color of an 
image with the foreground color. You can use this tool in a variety of ways. 

476
Colorizing with the Color Replacement Tool
476
Create the look of a hand-painted photo by colorizing a grayscale image. 
Or maybe you just want to change the color of an object or two, such as a 
couple of flowers in a bouquet. And even though Elements has a bona fide 
Red Eye tool, you can also use the Color Replacement tool to eliminate red 
(or yellow or green) eye in people and animals.
	
The great thing about the Color Replacement tool is that, like the other heal­
ing tools, it completely preserves the tonality of the image. The color that 
you apply doesn’t obliterate the midtones, shadows, and highlights as it 
would if you were applying color with the regular Brush tool. The Color 
Replacement tool works by first sampling the original colors in the image 
and then replacing those colors with the foreground color. By specifying 
different sampling methods, limits, and tolerance settings, you can control 
the range of colors that Elements replaces.
Follow these steps to replace existing color with your foreground color:
	
	 1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open your image and select the Color 
Replacement tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 This tool shares a flyout menu with the Brush and Pencil tools.
	
	 You can press the B key to select it (or Shift+B to cycle through the tools).
	
2.	 On the Options bar, specify your desired brush-tip diameter and hard­
ness from the Brush Preset Picker drop-down panel.
	
3.	 In the Options bar, select your desired Blend mode:
	
•	 Color: This default mode works well for most colorizing jobs. Use this 
mode if you’re trying to get rid of red eye.
	
•	 Hue: This mode is similar to color, but less intense, providing a sub­
tler effect.
	
•	 Saturation: This mode is the one to use to convert the color in your 
image to grayscale. Set your foreground color to Black on the Tools 
panel.
	
•	 Luminosity: This mode is the opposite of the Color mode. Although 
this Blend mode can create a beautiful effect between two image 
layers, it doesn’t tend to provide that great an effect in other 
circumstances.
	
4.	 Select your sampling method (represented by the icons) from the 
icons in the Options bar:
	
•	 Continuous: Samples and replaces color continuously while you drag 
your mouse.
	
•	 Once: Replaces colors in only the areas that contain the color you 
first sampled when you initially clicked.
	
•	 Background Swatch: Replaces colors in only the areas containing 
your current background color.

5.	 Select your sampling limits mode.
	
•	 Contiguous: The default setting replaces the color of pixels containing 
the sampled color that are adjacent to each other directly under the 
brush.
	
•	 Discontiguous: Replaces the color of the pixels containing the 
sampled color wherever it occurs under your brush.
	
6.	 Specify your tolerance percentage.
	
	 Tolerance refers to a range of color. A high tolerance lets you replace a 
broad range of color. A low tolerance limits the replacement of color to 
only the areas that are very similar to the sampled color.
	
7.	 Choose whether you want anti-aliasing.
	
	 Remember, anti-aliasing slightly softens and smooths the edge of the 
sampled areas.
	
8.	 After you establish your settings, click or drag in your image.
	
	 Notice how the foreground color, which in our example is pink (who 
doesn’t yearn for pink cowboy boots?), replaces the original colors of 
the sampled areas (see Figure 1-19). Of course, the exact effect you get 
depends on your settings.

Lightening and Darkening with Dodge and Burn Tools
478
	
If you want to be more accurate, make a selection before you replace your 
color so you can avoid coloring elements you don’t want to color.
Lightening and Darkening with 
Dodge and Burn Tools
Dodging and burning originated in the darkroom, where photographers 
would salvage negatives containing areas that were too dark or too light by 
adding or subtracting exposure as an enlarger made the prints.
An enlarger makes a print by projecting an image of a negative onto a piece 
of photosensitive paper. During the exposure, the darkroom technician can 
reduce the amount of light falling onto the paper by placing some object 
(often a disk shape of cardboard or metal impaled on a piece of wire) in the 
light path to dodge part of the image. The worker can burn other parts of an 
image by exposing only a small portion through an opening, such as the fin­
gers in a cupped pair of hands or a piece of cardboard with a hole. The 
Dodge and Burn tools in Elements adopt their icons from those analog tools 
used in the darkroom.
However, the digital counterparts are a great deal more flexible and precise. 
For example, the worker in a darkroom varies the size of the dodging or 
burning tool by moving it up or down in the light path. Unfortunately, the 
closer the real-world tool gets to the paper, the sharper it appears, forcing 
the darkroom worker to move the tool more rapidly and frequently to blur 
the edges of the effects. With the Elements Dodge and Burn tools, you can 
specify the size of the tool and its softness by selecting one of the many 
brush tips available.
You can also limit the correction to a specific tonal range in your image — 
shadows, midtones, or highlights. You can adjust the degree of lightening 
and darkening applied by specifying an exposure percentage, too.
	
The Dodge (used to lighten) and Burn (used to darken) tools can be very 
effective, but you can’t add detail that isn’t there. Keep the following in mind:
	
✓	When you lighten very dark shadows that contain little detail, you end 
up with grayish shadows.
	
✓	Darkening very light areas that are completely washed out doesn’t make 
your image look very good, either. You’ll end up with white patches.

In either case, you want to use the Dodge and Burn tools in moderation and 
work only with small areas. To dodge or burn a portion of an image, just 
follow these steps:
	 1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open an image with under- or over-
exposed areas and select the Dodge or Burn tool from the Tools panel.
	
	
	 Press the O key to choose the tool or press Shift+O to cycle through 
the available tools until the one you want is active.
	
2.	 In the Options bar, select a brush from the Brush Preset Picker drop-
down panel and also adjust the brush size, if necessary.
	
	 Larger, softer brushes spread the dodging-and-burning effect over a 
larger area, making blending with the surrounding area easier, creating a 
more realistic, unretouched appearance.
	
3.	 In the Options bar, under the Range drop-down list, select Shadows, 
Midtones, or Highlights.
	
	 Select Shadows to lighten or darken detail in the darker areas of your 
image. Choose Midtones to adjust the tones of average darkness. And 
select Highlights to make the brightest areas even lighter or darker.
	
	 In Figure 1-20, the original image had mostly dark areas, so we dodged 
the shadows. Note the increased detail in the eyes, teeth, and hair. We 
also gave a couple swipes to the highlight areas with the Burn tool.

4.	 In the Options bar, select the amount of correction you want to apply 
with each stroke by using the Exposure slider or text box.
	
	 Exposure is similar to the Opacity setting that you use with the regular 
Brush tool. Start with a lower percentage to better control the amount of 
darkening or lightening. High exposure values can overcorrect and pro­
duce unnatural-looking, obviously dodged or burned areas in your 
images. (We used a setting of 10 percent.)
	
5.	 Drag or “paint” over the areas you want to lighten or darken, gradually 
building up the desired effect.
	
	 Note that you can make a selection prior to your dragging to make cer­
tain that the adjustment is applied only to that specific area.
	
6.	 If you go too far, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) to reverse your most 
recent stroke.
	
7.	 When you finish, choose File➪Save to store the image.
Turning Color Up or Down with the Sponge Tool
The Sponge tool soaks up or squeezes out color. It can reduce the richness 
or intensity (or saturation) of a color in applied areas. It can also perform 
the reverse, giving a specific area richer, more vibrant colors.
Surprisingly, the Sponge tool also works in grayscale mode by darkening or 
lightening the pixels. Unlike the Hue/Saturation command (under 
Enhance➪Adjust Color), which works only on layers or selections, you can 
use the Sponge tool on any area that you can paint with a brush.
You can use the Sponge tool on an image in subtle ways to reduce the satu­
ration in selected areas for an interesting effect. For example, you may have 
an object that’s the center of attention in your picture simply because the 
colors are very bright. The Sponge tool lets you reduce the color saturation 
of that area (and only that area) to allow the other sections of your image to 
become the focal point. You can also use the Sponge tool to make an artistic 
statement: You could reduce or increase the saturation of a single person 
in a group shot to give that person more attention (perhaps as being more 
colorful than the rest).
To use the Sponge tool, just follow these steps:
	
	 1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open an image and select the Sponge 
tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 Press the O key to choose the Sponge if it’s active, or press Shift+O to 
cycle through the tools until the Sponge tool is active.

Smoothing with the Smudge Tool
The Smudge tool performs a kind of warping effect by pushing your pixels 
around as if they consisted of wet paint, using the color that’s under the 
cursor when you start to stroke. However, don’t view the Smudge tool as a 
simple distortion tool that produces only comical effects. We use it on tiny

areas of an image to soften the edges of objects in a way that often looks 
more natural than when we use the Blur tool. The Smudge tool can also be 
used to create a soft, almost-painted look, as shown in Figure 1-22. Just don’t 
get too carried away, or you may obliterate detail that you want to preserve.
Figure 1-22: The Smudge tool can give your objects a soft, painted look.
	
Smudged areas may be obvious because of their smooth appearance. Adding 
a little texture by using the Noise filter after you smudge is often a good idea 
if you want to blend a smudged section in with its surroundings. You can 
find tips on applying the Noise filter in Book VII, Chapter 1.
To apply the Smudge tool, just follow these steps:
	
	 1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open the image and select the Smudge 
tool from the Tools panel.
	
	 Press Shift+R to cycle through the Smudge, Blur, and Sharpen tools.
	
2.	 In the Options bar, select a brush from the Brushes Presets drop-down 
panel.
	
	 Use a small brush for smudging tiny areas, such as edges. Larger 
brushes produce drastic effects, so use them with care.
	
3.	 In the Options bar, select a blending mode from the Mode pop-up 
menu.
	
4.	 In the Options bar, select the strength of the smudging effect with the 
Strength slider or text box.
	
	 Low values produce a lighter effect; high values really push your pixels 
around.

5.	 If your image has multiple layers, select the Sample All Layers option 
to make Elements use pixels from all visible layers when it produces 
the effect.
	
	 The smudge still appears only on the active layer, but the look is a bit 
different depending on the contents of the underlying layers.
	
6.	 Use the Finger Painting option to begin the smudge by using the fore­
ground color.
	
	 You can get some interesting effects with this option. Rather than use 
the color under your cursor, this option smears your foreground color 
at the start of each stroke.
	
	 You can switch the Smudge tool into Finger Painting mode temporarily 
by holding down the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac) while you drag. 
Release Alt (Option) to go back to Normal mode.
	
7.	 Paint over the areas you want to smudge.
	
	 Pay attention to your strokes because this tool can radically change 
your image. If you don’t like the results, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) 
to undo the changes and then lower the Strength percentage (discussed 
in Step 4) even more.
	
	 This tool can be a little destructive. If you’re looking to preserve reality, 
use it with restraint. If you want to get wild, go crazy.
	
8.	 When you finish, choose File➪Save to store your image.
Softening with the Blur Tool
The Blur tool can be used for both repair and more creative tasks. Adding a 
little blur here and there can save an image with a few defects. Blurring can 
also be used for artistic effect — say, to add a little motion to a soccer ball 
frozen in time by a too-fast shutter speed. You can also blur portions of your 
image to emphasize and focus on a particular element, as shown in Figure 
1-23, where we blurred the water and the girl’s body a bit to draw attention 
to her face. The Blur tool makes it easy to paint your blur effects exactly 
where you want them. This tool works by decreasing the contrast among 
adjacent pixels in the painted area.
The mechanics of using the Blur tool and several of its options are similar to 
those of the Smudge tool. Just follow these steps:
	
	 1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open an image and select the Blur 
tool from the Tools panel.

2.	 In the Options bar, select a brush from the Brushes Presets drop-down 
panel.
	
	 Use a small brush for applying small areas of blur.
	
	 Use larger brushes with caution. For example, if your goal is to blur the 
entire background to make a foreground object appear sharper in com­
parison, it’s better to make a selection and apply the Blur filter, as 
described in Book VII, Chapter 1.
	
3.	 In the Options bar, select a blending mode from the Mode pop-up 
menu.
	
4.	 In the Options bar, select the strength of the blurring effect with the 
Strength slider or text box.
	
5.	 If your image has multiple layers, select the Sample All Layers option 
to make Elements use pixels from all visible layers when it produces 
the effect.
	
	 Selecting this option can produce a smoother blur when you merge the 
layers later. See Book VI for more info on layers.
	
6.	 Paint over the areas you want to blur.
	
7.	 When you finish, choose File➪Save to store your image.
Focusing with the Sharpen Tool
In theory, the Sharpen tool is nothing more than the Blur tool in reverse — 
instead of decreasing contrast among pixels, the Sharpen tool increases the 

485

Makeovers
Focusing with the Sharpen Tool
485
contrast. In practice, however, use this tool with a bit more care than the 
Blur tool. Whereas blurred areas tend to fade from a viewer’s notice (at least, 
in terms of how his or her eyes perceive them), sharpened areas of an image 
jump out at people. Even a small area that’s been oversharpened can quickly 
lead to overly grainy and noisy images.
You can often successfully sharpen 
small areas with the Sharpen tool. 
Sometimes, the eyes in a portrait can 
benefit from a little sharpening, as 
shown in Figure 1-24. Or you might 
want to sharpen an area to make it 
stand out more distinctly against a 
slightly blurred background.
Follow these simple steps to use the 
Sharpen tool:
	
	 1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, 
open an image and select the 
Sharpen tool from the Tools panel.
	
2.	 In the Options bar, select a brush 
from the Brushes Presets 
drop-down panel.
	
	 Use a small brush for applying 
small areas of sharpening.
	
3.	 In the Options bar, select a blending
mode from the Mode pop-up menu.
	
4.	 In the Options bar, select the strength of the sharpening effect with 
the Strength slider or text box.
	
	 Using a fairly low value (say, 25 percent or less) is a good idea because 
you can build up sharpness slowly, being careful not to overdo it.
	
	 You know you’ve gone too far with the sharpness when the pixels start 
to look noisy and grainy.
	
5.	 If your image has multiple layers, select the Sample All Layers option 
to make Elements use pixels from all visible layers when it produces 
the effect.
	
6.	 Paint over the areas you want to sharpen.
	
7.	 When you finish, choose File➪Save to store your image.
	
Sharpening increases contrast, so be careful when using the Sharpen tool if 
you plan to also adjust the Levels or Curves controls. Any change that 
increases contrast in the whole image also boosts the contrast of an area 
you’ve sharpened.
Figure 1-24: Use the Sharpen tool sparingly 
and in small areas, such as in the eyes of 
this portrait.

The Unsharp Mask and Smart Sharpen filters offer more options and better 
overall control, so unless you really need to use the sharpening effect, you’re 
usually better off using a filter. (Book VII, Chapter 1, has more on filters in 
general.)
Putting It Together
Fixing a Photo
Unless you’re a highly skilled photographer, you probably have a few photos that require 
a number of digital fixes. Certainly, we both do. Although it may seem like fixing them 
is too much trouble or will take too long, you’ll find how easy it is after you practice the 
techniques a few times. After a while, you may even get into the habit of running through 
your personal quick-editing workflow before you organize and archive your images in the 
Organizer (or Adobe Bridge on the Mac). If you have more time to burn, you can also add 
a few artistic touches to further enhance those shots. That way when you get the urge to 
share those photos, they’re just an e-mail or print away.
Note that most of the details for executing these steps are described in this chapter. 
When they aren’t, we give you the book and chapter where you can find further explana­
tions. If these steps are too tedious for you, you can always follow the Edit Quick mode 
route we described earlier in the section, “Editing with Edit Quick Mode.”
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, open any image in need of repair.
	
	 The image of our woman is in bad shape — horrible contrast, color, soft focus, 
scratches, and in need of some healing, as shown in the figure.

	 For details on working with layers, see Book VI.
	
5.	 Adjust the contrast of your image, if needed. Try Enhance➪Auto Contrast. If that 
doesn’t work well, undo it with Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) and choose Enhance➪
Adjust Lighting➪Shadows and Highlights or Levels.
	
	 Make sure you have good tones in the shadows (dark areas), midtones (middle-toned 
areas), and highlights (light areas). Also ensure that you can see details in all the 
tonal ranges, as shown in the figure. For details on using the Shadows and 
Highlights and Levels commands, see Book VIII, Chapter 2. For our woman, we 
broke out the big guns — Levels.

6.	 Adjust the color of your image, if needed. If you didn’t use an auto fix in Step 6, 
you could try the Auto Color command under the Enhance submenu. Or choose 
Enhance➪Adjust Color and select one of the color-adjustment commands 
described in Book VIII, Chapter 2.
	
	 If you need to adjust the skin tones of your people, you can try the Adjust Skin Tones 
command. We recommend using the Adjust Color Curves command for overall color 
adjustment, as we did for our woman in the figure. Usually working with this curve 
will do the trick, no matter what your color issues are.
	
	 Note that you can fix just selected portions of your image. Make a selection first and 
then apply the adjustment. For details on making selections, see Book IV, Chapter 1.

	 This fix should always be the last adjustment you make on your image. You want to 
make sure that all your contrast, color, and flaws are fixed before sharpening. The 
reason is that the sharpening process increases contrast, so you don’t want to 
exacerbate any problems that may exist. Our “fixed” woman is shown in the final

f you’ve tried the quick automatic fixes on your photos but they didn’t 
correct them to your satisfaction, this chapter should be of some help. 
Fortunately, Elements offers multiple ways and multiple levels of correcting 
and enhancing your images. If an auto fix doesn’t work, elevate to a manual 
fix. Chances are that if you can’t find the tools to correct and repair your 
images in Elements, those images are probably beyond salvaging.
Using this chapter and the information provided in Chapter 1 of this mini­
book as your jumping-off points, try to employ some kind of logical work­
flow when you tackle the correction and repair of your images. Personally, 
we’re partial to the following series of steps:
	
1.	 Crop, straighten, and resize your images, if necessary.
	
2.	 After you have the images in their proper physical 
state, correct the lighting and establish good 
tonal range for your shadows, highlights, and 
midtones in order to display the greatest detail 
possible.
	
	 Often, just correcting the lighting solves minor 
color problems. If not, move on to adjusting 
the color balance.
	
3.	 Eliminate any colorcasts and adjust the 
saturation, if necessary.
	
4.	 Grab the retouching tools, such as the healing 
tools and filters, to retouch any flaws.
	
5.	 Sharpen your image if you feel that it could use a boost in 
clarity and sharpness.
	
6.	 Apply any enhancements or special effects, if desired.
	
	 By following these steps, in this order, you should be able to get all your 
images in shape to print, post, and share with family and friends.

Understanding the Histogram Panel
492
Understanding the Histogram Panel
One of the first things you want to do 
before you make any color or tonal 
adjustments to your image is to take a 
good look at the quality and distribu­
tion of the tones throughout your 
image. We don’t mean just eyeballing 
the composite image on your screen. 
We’re talking about getting inside your 
image and looking at its guts with the 
Histogram panel — and keeping it 
onscreen so you can see its constant 
feedback on your image adjustments.
A histogram displays the tonal range of 
an image, as shown in Figure 2-1. It 
shows how the pixels are distributed 
by graphing the number of pixels at 
each of the 256 brightness levels in an 
image. On this graph, pixels with the 
same brightness level are stacked in bars along a vertical axis. The higher 
the line from this axis, the greater the number of pixels at that brightness 
level. You can view the distribution for the entire image, a selected layer, or 
an adjustment composite (described in the following section).
	
From this graph, you can determine whether the image contains enough 
detail in the shadow, midtone, and highlight areas. This information helps 
you determine what image adjustments you may need to make. The following 
steps walk you through the basics of using the panel and understanding the 
information you find there:
	
1.	 Choose Window➪Histogram to bring up the panel.
	
2.	 Choose your desired source of the histogram’s display from the 
Source drop-down list:
	
•	 Entire Image: Displays a histogram of the entire image.
	
•	 Selected Layer: Displays a histogram of just the selected layers in the 
Layers panel.
	
•	 Adjustment Composite: Displays a histogram of a selected adjustment 
layer and all the layers below it.
	
3.	 Choose to view isolated portions of your image by choosing an option 
from the Channel drop-down list:
	
•	 RGB: Displays a composite image of all color channels — red, green, 
and blue.
Figure 2-1: The Histogram panel displays 
how pixels are distributed at each of the 256 
brightness levels.

•	 Red, Green and Blue: Displays the histogram of each individual color 
channel. 
	
•	 Luminosity: Displays the luminance, or intensity, of the RGB 
composite image.
	
•	 Colors: Displays the composite RGB histogram by color. Red, green, 
and blue represent the pixels in each of those channels. Gray repre­
sents the area where all three channels overlap.
	
4.	 Examine the tonal range in the histogram.
	
	 An image with good tonal range displays pixels in all areas. An image 
with poor tonal range has gaps in the histogram, as shown in Figure 2-2.
	
	 The rest of this chapter explains ways you can correct contrast and 
color problems that you find.

5.	 (Optional) If you’re into numbers, check the statistics to evaluate your 
image, as well:
	
	 Drag your cursor within the histogram to see the statistics about a range 
of values. Or position the cursor within a specific area of the histogram 
you’re interested in.
	
	 Some of these statistics, such as Standard Deviation, may be for those 
who live in the mathematical land of Statistics. But you may be able to 
get some useful information from the other statistics that can help you 
in your image-adjusting tasks. Here’s a brief explanation of each 
statistic:
	
•	 Mean: Average intensity value
	
•	 Standard Deviation: How much the intensity values vary
	
•	 Median: Middle value of the intensity value range
	
•	 Pixels: Total number of pixels used to represent the histogram
	
•	 Level: Intensity level
	
•	 Count: The total number of pixels corresponding to that intensity 
level
	
•	 Percentile: The number of cumulative pixels (in percentages) at or 
below that level, from 0% (left) to 100% (right)
	
•	 Cache Level: The current level of image cache used to calculate the 
histogram. For more info on cache, see Book I, Chapter 4.
Adjusting Lighting
Elements has several simple, manual tools you can use to fix lighting if the 
Auto tools (that we describe in Book VIII, Chapter 1) don’t cut the mustard. 
The manual tools offer more control for adjusting overall contrast, as well as 
bringing out details in shadow, midtones, and highlight areas of your images. 
Note that all lighting adjustments can be found in both Edit Full and Edit 
Quick modes.
Fixing lighting with Shadows/Highlights
The Shadows/Highlights command offers a quick-and-easy method of cor­
recting over- and underexposed areas. This feature works especially well 
with images shot in bright, overhead light or in light coming from the back 
(backlit). These images usually suffer from having the subject partially or 
completely surrounded in shadows, such as the original image (left) in 
Figure 2-3.

Figure 2-3: Correct the lighting in your images with the Shadows/
Highlights command.
To use the Shadows/Highlights command, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Edit Full or Edit Quick mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪
Shadows/Highlights and make sure the Preview check box is selected.
	
	 When the Shadows/Highlights dialog box appears, the default correction 
is applied automatically in your preview.
	
2.	 If the default adjustment doesn’t fix the problem, move the sliders 
(or enter a value) to adjust the amount of correction for your shadows 
(dark areas), highlights (light areas), and midtones (middle-toned areas).
	
	 Try to reveal more detail in the dark and light areas of your image. If, 
after you do so, your image still looks as if it needs more correction, add 
or delete contrast in your midtone areas.
	
3.	 Click OK to apply the adjustment and close the dialog box.
	
	 If you want to start over, press the Alt (Option on the Mac) key and click 
the Reset button (previously the Cancel button).
Using Brightness/Contrast
Despite its very descriptive name, the Brightness/Contrast command doesn’t 
do a great job of either brightening (making an image darker or lighter) or 
adjusting contrast. Initially, users tend to be drawn to this command because 

Adjusting Lighting
496
of its logical name and ease of use. But after users realize its limitations, they 
move on to better tools with more controls, such as Shadows/Highlights and 
Levels.
The problem with the Brightness/Contrast command is that it applies the 
adjustment equally to all areas of the image. For example, you may have a 
photo that has some highlights that need darkening, but all the midtones 
and shadows are okay. The Brightness slider isn’t adept enough to recognize 
that, so when you start to darken the highlights in your image, the midtones 
and shadows also become darker. To compensate for the unwanted darken­
ing, you try to adjust the Contrast, which doesn’t fix the problem.
The moral is, if you want to use the Brightness/Contrast command, select 
only the areas that need the correction, as shown in Figure 2-4. (For more on 
selections, see Book IV, Chapters 1 and 2.) After you make your selection, 
choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Brightness/Contrast.
You can also find the Brightness/Contrast command in Guided mode.
Figure 2-4: The Brightness/Contrast command is best reserved
for correcting selected areas (left) rather than the entire 
image (right).
Nailing proper contrast with Levels
If you want the real deal when it comes to correcting the brightness and con­
trast (and even the color) in your image, look no further than the Levels 
command. Granted, the dialog box is a tad more complex than those for the 
other lighting and color-adjustment commands, but when you understand 
how it works, the payoff is well worth it.
You can get a taste of what Levels can do by using Auto Levels, explained in 
Book VIII, Chapter 1. However, the Levels command offers much more control. 
And, unlike the rudimentary Brightness/Contrast command, Levels enables 
you to darken or lighten 256 different tones. Keep in mind that Levels can be 
used on your entire image, a single layer, or a selected area. You can also 

Book VIII 
Chapter 2
Correcting Lighting, 
Color, and Clarity
Adjusting Lighting
497
apply the Levels command by using an adjustment layer, a recommended 
method, as we describe in Book VI, Chapter 1.
If you’re serious about image editing, the Levels command is one tool you 
want to master. Here’s how it works:
	
1.	 In Edit Full or Edit Quick mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪
Levels.
	
	 We recommend using Edit Full mode for this command because you 
have access to the Info panel needed in Step 2.
	
	 The Levels dialog box appears, displaying its own histogram. This graph 
displays how the pixels of the image are distributed at each of the 256 
available brightness levels. Shadows are shown on the left side of the 
histogram, midtones are in the middle, and highlights are on the right. 
For details on histograms, see the first section of this chapter.
	
	 Although you generally make changes to the entire document by using 
the RGB channel, you can apply changes to any one of an image’s com­
ponent color channels by selecting the specific channel in the Channel 
pop-up menu. You can also make adjustments to just selected areas, 
which can be helpful when one area of your image needs adjusting and 
others don’t.
	
2.	 In Edit Full mode, choose Window➪Info to open the Info panel.
	
3.	 Set the black and white points manually by using the eyedroppers in 
the dialog box; first select the White Eyedropper tool and then 
move the cursor over the image.
	
4.	 Look at the Info panel, try to find the lightest white in the image, and 
then select that point by clicking it.
	
	 The lightest white has the highest RGB values.
	
5.	 Repeat Steps 3 and 4, using the Black Eyedropper tool and trying to 
find the darkest black in the image.
	
	 The darkest black has the lowest RGB values.
	
	 When you set the pure black and pure white points, the remaining pixels 
are redistributed between those two points.
	
	 You can also reset the white and black points by moving the position of 
the white and black triangles on the input sliders (just below the histo­
gram). Or, you can enter values in the Input Levels boxes. The three 
boxes represent the black, gray, and white triangles, respectively. Use 
the numbers 0 to 255 in the white and black boxes.

neutral gray portion of your image, one in which the Info panel shows 
equal values of red, green, and blue.
	
	 Note that if your image is grayscale, you can’t use the Gray 
Eyedropper tool.
	
	 If you’re not sure where there’s a neutral gray, you can also remove a 
colorcast by choosing a color channel from the Channel pop-up menu 
and doing one of the following:
	
•	 Choose the Red channel and drag the midtone slider to the right to 
add cyan or to the left to add red.
	
•	 Choose the Green channel and drag the midtone slider to the right to 
add magenta or to the left to add green.
	
•	 Choose the Blue channel and drag the midtone slider to the right to 
add yellow or to the left to add blue.
	
7.	 If your image has too much contrast, adjust the output sliders at the 
bottom of the Levels dialog box.
	
	 Moving the black triangle to the right reduces the contrast in the shad­
ows and lightens the image. Moving the white triangle to the left reduces 
the contrast in the highlights and darkens the image.
	
8.	 Adjust the midtones (or gamma values) with the gray triangle input 
slider.
	
	 The default value for gamma is 1.0. Drag the triangle to the left to lighten 
midtones and drag to the right to darken them. You can also enter a value.
	
9.	 Click OK to apply your settings and close the dialog box.
	
	 The contrast in your images should be improved, as shown in Figure 2-5.
	
When you click the Auto button, Elements applies the same adjustments as 
the Auto Levels command, as we explain in Book VIII, Chapter 1. Note the 
changes and subsequent pixel redistribution shown in the histogram after 
you click this button.

Adjusting Color
Getting the color you want sometimes seems about as attainable as finding a 
pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. Sometimes, an unexpected colorcast (a 
shift in color) can be avoided when photographing, for example, by using (or 
not using, in some cases) a flash or lens filter. After the fact, you can usually 
do a decent job of correcting the color with one of the many Elements adjust­
ments. Occasionally, you may want to change the color of your image to cre­
ate a certain special effect. Conversely, you also may want to strip out most of 
the color from your image to create a vintage feel. Remember that all these 
color adjustments can be applied to your entire image, a single layer, or just a 
selection. Whatever your color needs, they’ll no doubt be met in Elements.
All color adjustments can be found in either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode 
except for Defringe Layers, which is available only in Edit Full mode.
	
If you shoot your photos in the Camera Raw file format, you can open and fix 
your files in the Camera Raw dialog box. Remember that Camera Raw files 
haven’t been processed by your camera. You’re in total control of the color 
and the exposure. For more on Camera Raw, see Book III, Chapter 3.
Removing colorcasts automatically
If you ever took a photo in an office or classroom and got a nasty green tint 
in your image, it was most likely caused by the overhead fluorescent lighting. 
To eliminate this green tint, or colorcast, you can apply the Remove Color Cast 
command. This feature is designed to adjust the image’s overall color and 
remove the cast.
Follow these short steps to correct your image:
	
1.	 Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Remove Color Cast in either Edit Full 
or Edit Quick mode.
	
	 The Remove Color Cast dialog box appears. Move the dialog box to 
better view your image. Note that this command is also available in 
Guided mode.
	
2.	 Click an area in your photo that should be white, black, or neutral 
gray, as shown in Figure 2-6.
	
	 The colors in the image are adjusted according to the color you choose. 
Which color should you choose? The answer depends on the subject mat­
ter of your image. Feel free to experiment. Your adjustment is merely a 
preview at this point and isn’t applied until you click OK. If you goof up, 
click the Reset button, and your image reverts to its unadjusted state.
	
3.	 If you’re satisfied with the adjustment, click OK to accept it and close 
the dialog box.

If the Remove Color Cast command doesn’t fix the problem, try using the 
Color Variations command or applying a photo filter (as we describe in the 
section “Adjusting color temperature with photo filters,” later in this chapter). 
For example, if your photo has too much green, try applying a magenta filter.
Adjusting with Hue/Saturation
The Hue/Saturation command enables you to adjust the colors in your image 
based on their hue, saturation, and lightness. Hue is the color in your image. 
Saturation is the intensity, or richness, of that color. And lightness controls 
the brightness value.
Follow these steps to adjust color by using the Hue/Saturation command:
	
1.	 In either Edit Full or Edit Quick mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Adjust Hue/Saturation.
	
	 The Hue/Saturation dialog box appears. Be sure to select the Preview 
check box so that you can view your adjustments. Note that this 
command is also available in Guided mode.
	
2.	 Select all the colors (Master) from the dialog box’s Edit drop-down list 
or choose one color to adjust.
	
3.	 Drag the slider for one or more of the following attributes to adjust 
the colors as described:
	
•	 Hue: Shifts all the colors clockwise (drag right) or counterclockwise 
(drag left) around the color wheel.
	
•	 Saturation: Increases (drag right) or decreases (drag left) the rich­
ness of the colors. Note that dragging all the way to the left gives you 
the appearance of a grayscale image.

Book VIII 
Chapter 2
Correcting Lighting, 
Color, and Clarity
Adjusting Color
501
	
•	 Lightness: Increases the brightness values by adding white (drag 
right) or decreases the brightness values by adding black (drag left).
	
	 The top color ramp at the bottom of the dialog box represents the colors 
in their order on the color wheel before you make any changes. The 
lower color bar displays the colors after you make your adjustments.
	
	 When you select an individual color to adjust, sliders appear between 
the color bars so that you can define the range of color to be adjusted. 
You can select, add, or subtract colors from the range by choosing one 
of the Eyedropper tools and clicking in the image.
	
	 The Hue/Saturation dialog box also lets you colorize images, a useful 
option for creating sepia-colored images.
	
4.	 (Optional) Check the Colorize option to change the colors in your 
image to a new, single color. Drag the Hue slider to change the color 
to the desired hue.
	
	 The pure white and black pixels remain unchanged, and the intermedi­
ate gray pixels are colorized.
	
Use the Hue/Saturation command with the Colorize option to create tinted 
photos, such as the one shown in Figure 2-7. You can also make selections in 
a grayscale image and apply a different tint to each selection. This can be 
especially fun with portraits. Tinted images can create a vintage or moody 
feel and can greatly improve mediocre photos.

Eliminating color with Remove Color
Despite all the talk in this chapter about color, we realize that there may be 
times when you don’t want any color. With the Remove Color command, you 
can eliminate all the color from an image, layer, or selection. In Figure 2-8, we 
selected the background and applied the Remove Color command. To use this 
one-step command, simply choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Remove Color.
Purestock
Figure 2-8: Eliminate color with the Remove Color command.
	
Sometimes, stripping away color with this command can leave your image flat, 
or low in contrast. If this is the case, adjust the contrast by using one of many 
lighting fixes in Elements, such as Auto Levels, Auto Contrast, or Levels.
The Convert to Black and White command (under the Enhance menu) 
enables you to convert a selection, a layer, or an entire image to grayscale. 
But, rather than just arbitrarily stripping color (as the Remove Color com­
mand does), the Convert to Black and White command enables you to select 
a conversion method by first choosing an image style. To further refine the 
results, you can add or subtract colors (red, green, or blue) or contrast by 
moving the Intensity sliders until your grayscale image looks the way you 
want. Note that you aren’t really adding color; you’re simply altering the 
amount of data in the color channels.
Switching colors with Replace Color
The Replace Color command enables you to replace designated colors in an 
image with other colors. You first select the colors you want to replace by 

Book VIII

creating a mask, which is a selection made by designating white (selected), 
black (unselected), and gray (partially selected) areas. (See Book VI, Chapter 4 
for more details on working with masks.) You can then adjust the hue and/or 
saturation of those selected colors.
Follow these steps to replace colors with others:
	
1.	 In Edit Quick or Edit Full mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Replace Color.
	
	 The Replace Color dialog box appears. Make sure to select the Preview 
check box.
	
2.	 Choose either Selection or Image:
	
•	 Selection: Shows the mask in the Preview area. The deselected areas are 
black, partially selected areas are gray, and selected areas are white.
	
•	 Image: Shows the actual image in the Preview area.
	
3.	 Click the colors you want to select in either the image or the 
Preview area.
	
4.	 Shift-click or use the plus sign (+) Eyedropper tool to add more colors.
	
5.	 Press the Alt (Option on the Mac) key or use the minus sign (–) 
Eyedropper tool to delete colors.
	
6.	 To add colors similar to the ones you select, use the Fuzziness slider 
to fine-tune your selection, adding or deleting from the selection 
based on the Fuzziness value.
	
	 To further fine-tune your selection, try using the new Localized Color 
Clusters option. This option lets you select multiple color clusters and 
can assist in getting a cleaner, more precise selection, especially when 
you’re trying to select more than one color.
	
7.	 Move the Hue and/or Saturation sliders to change the color or color 
richness, respectively. Move the Lightness slider to lighten or darken 
the image.
	
	 Go easy with the Lightness slider. You can reduce the tonal range too 
much and end up with a mess.
	
8.	 View the result in the Image window.
	
9.	 Click OK to apply the settings and close the dialog box.

Correcting with Color Curves
The most sophisticated of the color correctors is the Color Curves command. 
This adjustment attempts to improve the tonal range in color images by mak­
ing adjustments to highlights, shadows, and midtones in each color channel. 
Try using this command on images in which the foreground elements appear 
overly dark due to backlighting. Conversely, the adjustment is also designed 
to correct images that appear overexposed and washed out.
Here’s how to use this adjustment on a selection, a layer, or an entire image:
	
1.	 In Edit Quick or Edit Full mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Adjust Color Curves.
	
	 The Adjust Color Curves dialog box appears. Make sure to select the 
Preview check box. Move the dialog box to the side so that you can view 
the Image window while making adjustments.
	
	 Various curve adjustments appear in the Select a Style area of the 
dialog box.
	
2.	 Select a style to make your desired adjustments while viewing your 
image in the After window.
	
3.	 If you need more precision, use the Adjust Highlights, Midtone 
Brightness, Midtone Contrast, and Adjust Shadows sliders, as shown 
in Figure 2-10.

	 The graph on the right represents the distribution of tones in your image. 
When you first access the Adjust Color Curves dialog box, the tonal range 
of your image is represented by a straight line. While you drag the sliders, 
the straight line is altered, and the tonal range is adjusted accordingly.

Adjusting skin tones
Sometimes, the family and friends in your photos appear nauseated (green), 
sunburned (red), frigid (blue), or have taken on some other non-flesh-colored 
tone. To fix that problem, Elements provides a command that’s designed to 
adjust the overall color in the image and get skin tones back to more natural 
and attractive shades.
Here’s how to fix those skin tones:
	
1.	 Open your image in Edit Quick or Edit Full mode, select the Preview 
check box, and do one or both of the following:
	
•	 Select the layer that needs to be adjusted. If you don’t have any layers, 
your entire image is adjusted.
	
•	 Select the desired areas of skin that need to be adjusted. Only the 
selected areas are adjusted. This is recommended if you’re satisfied 
with the color of your other elements and just want to fix the skin 
tones. For more on selection techniques, see Book IV, Chapter 1.
	
2.	 Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Color for Skin Tone.
	
	 The Adjust Color for Skin Tone dialog box appears. This command can 
also be found in Guided mode.
	
3.	 In the Image window, click the portion of skin that needs to be 
corrected.
	
	 The command adjusts the color of the skin tone, as well as the color in 
the overall image, layer, or selection, depending on what you selected in 
Step 1.
	
4.	 If you’re unhappy with the results, click another area or adjust the 
Skin and Ambient Light sliders:
	
•	 Tan: Increases or decreases the amount of brown in the skin.
	
•	 Blush: Increases or decreases the amount of red in the skin.
	
•	 Temperature: Adjusts the overall color of the skin, making it warmer 
(right toward red) or cooler (left toward blue).
	
5.	 When you’re satisfied with the correction, click OK to apply the 
adjustment and close the dialog box.
	
	 Your improved skin appears, as shown in Figure 2-12.
	
	 To start from square one, click the Reset button. And, of course, to bail 
out completely, click Cancel.

Defringing layers
A surefire sign of a sloppily composited image is a selection with a fringe. 
Don’t get us wrong, if the fringe is the kind that is hanging off of your ’70s-era 
buckskin leather jacket, that’s fine. You just don’t want the fringe that con­
sists of those background pixels surrounding the edges of your selections, 
as shown in Figure 2-13. Sometimes, when you make a selection, some of the 
background pixels are picked up in the process. These pixels are referred to 
as a fringe or halo. Luckily, the Defringe command replaces the color of the 
fringe pixels with the colors of neighboring pixels that don’t contain the 
background color. In our example, we plucked the globe out of a white back­
ground and placed it on a black background. Some of the background pixels 
were included in our selection and appear as white fringe. When we apply 
the Defringe command, those white fringe pixels are changed to colors of 
nearby pixels, as shown in Figure 2-13.
Follow these steps to defringe your selection:
	
1.	 In Edit Full mode only, copy and paste a selection onto a new or 
existing layer, or drag and drop a selection onto a new document.
	
2.	 Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Defringe Layer.
	
	 The Defringe dialog box appears.

3.	 Enter a value for the number of pixels that needs to be converted.
	
	 Try entering 1 or 2 first to see whether that fixes the fringe problem. If 
not, you may need to enter a slightly higher value.
	
4.	 Click OK to accept the value and close the dialog box.

Correcting with Color Variations
Although we give you several ways in this chapter to eliminate colorcasts in 
an image, here’s one more. The Variations command has been around for 
years and is largely unchanged. That’s probably because it’s one of those 
rare features that’s easy to use, easy to understand, and is actually effective. 
The command enables you to make corrections by visually comparing 
thumbnails of color variations of your image. You might use this command 
when you’re not quite sure what’s wrong with the color or what kind of col­
orcast your image has.
Here’s how to use the Color Variations command:
	
1.	 Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Color Variations in Edit Quick or Edit 
Full mode.
	
	 The Color Variations dialog box appears, displaying a preview of your 
original image (before) and the corrected image (after), as shown in 
Figure 2-14.

Figure 2-14: Color Variations enables you to color-correct your images 
by comparing thumbnails.
	
2.	 Select your desired tonal range or color richness (if you’re unsure 
which range to select, start with the Midtones):
	
•	 Shadows, Midtones, or Highlights: Adjusts the dark, middle, or light 
areas in the image, respectively.
	
•	 Saturation: Adjusts the color intensity or richness, making colors 
more intense (saturated) or less intense (desaturated). If your image 
is faded from time, be sure to increase the saturation after you 
correct any colorcast issues.
	
	 Usually, just correcting the midtones is enough to improve your image’s 
color. But if that doesn’t do the trick, try adjusting the shadows and 
highlights as well.
	
3.	 Specify how much adjustment you want with the Adjust Color 
Intensity slider.
	
	 Drag left to decrease the amount of adjustment and drag right to 
increase the amount.
	
4.	 If you selected Midtones, Shadows, or Highlights in Step 2, adjust the 
color by clicking the various Increase or Decrease Color buttons.
	
	 Click more than once if your initial application wasn’t sufficient to 
correct the problem.

7.	 If you make a mistake, click the Undo button.
	
	 The Color Variations dialog box supports multiple levels of undo. If you 
totally mess up things, click the Reset Image button to start again. Keep 
in mind that you can’t undo the Reset Image command after you click it.

8.	 To apply your color adjustments and close the dialog box, click OK.
	
Try using the Color Variations command to correct those old, faded, green-
tinted photos from back in the day. This feature enables you to easily cor­
rect the color and saturation of those memory-filled shots. Remember to 
either decrease the offending color or add the color that’s the opposite of 
the colorcast in the image. If it’s too green, add magenta and vice versa.
Adjusting color temperature with photo filters
Light has its own color temperature. A photo shot in a higher color tempera­
ture of light makes an image blue. An image shot in a lower color temperature 
makes a photo yellow. Photographers sometimes use colored glass filters in 
front of their camera lenses to adjust the color temperature of the light. 
They do this to warm up or cool down their photos, or just to add a hint of 
color for subtle special effects. You can, however, mimic this effect in 
Elements with the digital versions of these filters.
To apply the Photo Filter adjustment, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Edit Full mode, choose Filter➪Adjustments➪Photo Filter.
	
	 The Photo Filter dialog box appears.
	
	
Note that you can also apply the photo filter to an individual layer by 
creating a photo-filter adjustment layer. For details on adjustment layers, 
see Book VI, Chapter 1.
	
2.	 In the dialog box, select Filter to choose a preset filter from the drop-
down list, or select Color to select your own filter color from the Color 
Picker.
	
	 Here’s a brief description of each of the preset filters:
	
•	 Warming Filter (85), (81), and (LBA): Adjust the white balance in an 
image to make the colors warmer or more yellow. Filter (81) is like 
(85) and (LBA), but it’s best used for minor adjustments. 

Book VIII 
Chapter 2

•	 Cooling Filter (80), (82), and (LBB): Also adjust the white balance 
that’s shown, but instead of making the colors warmer, they make 
the colors cooler or bluer. Filter (82) is like (80) and (LBB), but it’s 
designed for slight adjustments.
	
•	 Red, Orange, Yellow, and so on: The various color filters adjust the 
hue, or color, of a photo. Choose a color filter to try to eliminate a 
colorcast or to apply a special effect.
	
3.	 Adjust the Density option to specify the amount of color applied to 
your image.
	
4.	 Check Preserve Luminosity to prevent the photo filter from darkening 
your image.
	
5.	 Click OK to apply your filter and close the dialog box.
	
	 Figure 2-15 shows the image before and after the application of a photo 
filter.
	
A good way to minimize the need for color adjustments is to be sure to set 
your camera’s white balance for your existing lighting conditions before 
shooting your photo.

Mapping your colors
Elements provides some commands referred to as color mappers, which 
change the colors in your image by mapping them to other values. The color 
mappers are found in the Filter➪Adjustments submenu. Figure 2-16 shows 
results of using these commands, which are also briefly described in the 
following sections.
Equalize
This mapper first locates the lightest and darkest pixels in the image and 
assigns them values of white and black. It then redistributes all the remaining 
pixels among the grayscale values. The exact effect depends on your 
individual image.

Gradient Map
This command maps the tonal range of an image to the colors of your 
chosen gradient. For example, colors (such as orange, green, and purple) 
are mapped to the shadows, highlight, and midtone areas.
Invert
This command reverses all the colors in your image, creating a kind of nega­
tive. Black reverses to white, and colors convert to their complementary 
hues (blue goes to yellow, red goes to cyan, and so on).
Posterize
This command reduces the number of colors in your image. Choose a value 
between 2 and 255 colors. Lower values create an illustrative, poster-like 
look, and higher values produce a more photo-realistic image.

Correcting Lighting,

Threshold
Threshold makes your image black and white, with all pixels that are 
brighter than a value you specify represented as white, and all pixels that 
are darker than that value as black. You can change the threshold level to 
achieve different high-contrast effects.
	
The Threshold command can come in handy when you need to clean up 
scans of line art, such as hand-drawn sketches, people’s signatures, pages 
from a book, or even sheet music. Often, when you scan things on paper, the 
slight color from the paper appears as a dull gray background in the scan. 
By applying the Threshold command, you can adjust the tones in your image 
to black and white and drop out the gray. Simply move the slider to get your 
desired balance of white and black areas.
Adjusting Clarity
After you’ve corrected the contrast and color and fixed your major flaws, 
like scratches, wrinkles and blemishes (as we describe in Chapter 1 of this 
minibook), you’re ready to finally work on the overall clarity of that image. If 
your image suffers from an overall problem like dust, scratches, or artifacts 
(blocky pixels or halos), you may need to employ the help of a filter. Then 
finally, after you totally clean up your image, your last task is to give it a 
good sharpening. Why wait until the very end to do so? Sometimes improv­
ing the contrast and color and getting rid of flaws can reduce the clarity and 
sharpness of an image. So you want to be sure that your image is as soft as 
it’s going to get before you dive into sharpening. On the other hand, keep in 
mind that sharpening increases contrast, so (depending on how much of 
your image you’re sharpening) you may need to go back and fine-tune it by 
using the lighting adjustments described in the section “Adjusting Lighting,” 
earlier in this chapter.
Lastly, we know we’ve been harping on the value of sharpening but, believe 
it or not, you may also need to occasionally blur your image. Blurring can 
eliminate unpleasant patterns that occur during scanning, soften distracting 
backgrounds to give a better focal point, or even create the illusion of motion.
Removing noise, artifacts, dust, and scratches
We know it sounds ironic, but the tools you use to eliminate unwanted gar­
bage from your images are found on the Filter➪Noise submenu in Edit Full 
mode. With the exception of the Add Noise filter, the others actually help to 
hide noise, dust, scratches, and artifacts. Here’s the list of cleaners:
	
✓	Despeckle: Decreases the contrast, without affecting the edges, to 
make the dust in your image less pronounced. You may notice a slight 
blurring of your image (that’s what’s hiding the garbage), but the edges 
should still be sharp.

Adjusting Clarity
514
	
✓	Dust & Scratches: Hides, well, dust and scratches by blurring those 
areas of your image that contain the gunk (it looks for harsh transitions 
in tone). Specify your desired Radius value, which is the size of the area 
to be blurred. Also, specify the Threshold value, which determines how 
much contrast between pixels must be present before they’re blurred.
	
	Use restraint with this filter. It can wipe out detail and make your image 
look like mush.
	
✓	Median: Reduces contrast around dust spots. The process the filter 
goes through is rather technical, but basically light spots darken, dark 
spots lighten, and the rest of the image isn’t changed. Specify your 
desired radius, which is the size of the area to be adjusted.
	
✓	Reduce Noise: Designed to remove luminance noise and artifacts from 
your images. We used this filter to correct the original image (on the 
left) in Figure 2-17, which had the nasty blockiness caused by JPEG com­
pression. Luminance noise is grayscale noise that makes images look 
overly grainy. Specify these options to reduce the noise in your image:
	
•	 Strength: Specify the amount of noise reduction.
	
•	 Preserve Details: A higher percentage preserves edges and details but 
reduces the amount of noise that’s removed.
	
•	 Reduce Color Noise: Remove random colored pixels.
	
•	 Remove JPEG Artifact: Remove the blocks and halos that can occur 
from low-quality JPEG compression.
Figure 2-17: Use the Reduce Noise filter to remove noise and artifacts.
Blurring when you need to
It may sound strange that anyone would intentionally want to blur an image. 
But, if your photo is overly grainy or suffers from an ugly moiré pattern 

Book VIII 
Chapter 2
Correcting Lighting, 
Color, and Clarity
Adjusting Clarity
515
(described in the following list), you may need to blur the image to correct 
the problem. Also, often, you may even want to blur the background of an 
image to deemphasize distractions, or to make the foreground elements 
appear sharper and provide a better focal point.
All the blurring tools are accessed by choosing Filter➪Blur in Edit Full or Edit 
Quick mode. The exception is the Blur tool, which we explain in Chapter 1 of 
this minibook:
	
✓	Average: This one-step filter calculates the average value of the image 
or selection and fills the area with that average value. You can use it for 
smoothing overly noisy areas in your image.
	
✓	Blur: Another one-step filter, this one applies a fixed amount of blurring 
to the whole image.
	
✓	Blur More: This one-step blur filter gives the same effect as Blur, but 
more intensely.
	
✓	Motion Blur: This filter mimics the blur given off by moving objects. 
Specify the angle of motion and the distance of the blur. Make sure to 
select the Preview check box to see the effect while you enter the values.
	
✓	Radial Blur: This filter produces a circular blur effect. Specify the 
amount of blur you want. Choose the Spin method to blur along concen­
tric circular lines, as shown in the thumbnail. Or choose Zoom to blur 
along radial lines and mimic the effect of zooming in to your image. 
Specify the desired Quality level. Because the Radial Blur filter is notori­
ously slow, Elements gives you the option of Draft (fast but grainy), 
Good, or Best (slow but smooth). The difference between Good and Best 
is evident only on large, high-resolution images. Finally, indicate where 
you want the center of your blur by moving the blur diagram thumbnail.
	
✓	Smart Blur: This filter provides several options to enable you to specify 
how the blur is applied. Specify a value for the radius and threshold, 
both defined in the following section. Start with a lower value for both 
and adjust from there. Choose a quality setting from the pop-up menu. 
Choose a mode setting. Normal blurs the entire image or selection. Edge 
Only blurs only the edges of your elements and uses black and white in 
the blurred pixels. Overlay Edge also blurs just the edges, but it applies 
only white to the blurred pixels.
	
✓	Surface Blur: This filter blurs the surface, or interior, of the image, 
rather than the edges. If you want to preserve your edge details but blur 
everything else, this is the filter for you.
	
✓	Gaussian Blur: The last Blur filter we discuss is probably the one you’ll 
use most often. It offers a Radius setting to let you adjust the amount of 
blurring you desire.

Adjusting Clarity

	Use the Gaussian Blur filter to cam­
ouflage moiré patterns on scanned 
images. A moiré pattern is caused 
when you scan halftone images. A 
halftone is created when a continu­
ous-tone image, such as a photo, is 
digitized and converted into a 
screen pattern of repeating lines 
(usually between 85 and 150 lines 
per inch) and then printed. When 
you then scan that halftone, a sec­
ond pattern results and is overlaid 
on the original pattern. These two 
different patterns clash and create 
an ugly moiré pattern. The 
Gaussian Blur filter doesn’t elimi­
nate the moiré — it just merges the 
dots and reduces the appearance of 
the pattern, as shown in Figure 2-18.
Sharpening for 
better focus
Of course, if your images don’t need 
any contrast-, color-, and flaw-fixing, 
feel free to move right into sharpening. Sometimes, images captured by a 
scanner or a digital camera are a little soft, and it’s not due to any tonal 
adjustments. Occasionally, you may even want to sharpen a selected area 
in your image just so that it becomes a better focal point.
Keep in mind that you can’t really improve the focus of an image after it’s 
captured. But you can do a decent job of faking it. All sharpening tools work 
by increasing the contrast between adjacent pixels. This increased contrast 
causes the edges to appear more distinct, thereby giving the illusion that the 
focus is improved, as shown in Figure 2-19. Remember that you can also use 
the Sharpen tool for very small areas, as described in Chapter 1 of this mini­
book. Here’s the lowdown on sharpening commands:
	
✓	Unsharp Mask: Unsharp Mask, in the Enhance menu in Edit Full or Edit 
Quick mode, gives you several options that enable you to control the 
amount of sharpening and the width of the areas to be sharpened. Use 
them to nail your desired sharpening:
	
•	 Amount: Specify an amount (from 1 to 500%) of edge sharpening. The 
higher the value, the more contrast between pixels around the edges. 
Figure 2-18: Blur your image to emphasize a 
focal point.

Book VIII 
Chapter 2
Correcting Lighting, 
Color, and Clarity
Adjusting Clarity
517
Start with a value of 100 percent (or less), which usually gives good 
contrast without appearing overly grainy.
	
•	 Radius: Specify the width (from .1 to 250 pixels) of the edges that the 
filter will sharpen. The higher the value, the wider the edge. The 
value you use is largely based on the resolution of your image. Low-
resolution images require a smaller radius value. High-resolution 
images require a higher value.
	
	 Be warned that specifying a value that’s too high overemphasizes the 
edges of your image and makes them appear thick and goopy.
	
	
	 A good rule of thumb in selecting a starting radius value is to divide 
your image’s resolution by 150. For example, if you have a 300-ppi 
(pixels per inch) image, set the radius at 2 and then use your eye to 
adjust from there.
	
•	 Threshold: Specify the difference in brightness (from 0 to 255) that 
must be present between adjacent pixels before the edge is sharp­
ened. A lower value sharpens edges with very little contrast differ­
ence. Higher values sharpen only when adjacent pixels are very 
different in contrast. We recommend leaving Threshold set at 0 unless 
your image is very grainy. Increasing the value too much can cause 
unnatural transitions between sharpened and unsharpened areas.
Figure 2-19: Sharpening mimics an increase in focus by increasing 
contrast between adjacent pixels.

Working Intelligently with the Smart Brush Tools
518
	
	Occasionally, the values you 
enter for Amount and Radius 
may sharpen the image effec­
tively but they can create 
excess grain, or noise, in your 
image. You can sometimes 
reduce this noise by increasing 
the Threshold value.
	
✓	Adjust Sharpness: Another 
sharpening option is the Adjust 
Sharpness command, as shown 
in Figure 2-20. This feature 
enables you to control the 
amount of sharpening applied to shadow and highlight areas. It also 
allows you to select from various sharpening algorithms.
	
	Specify the following options:
	
•	 Amount and Radius: See the two descriptions in the preceding 
Unsharp Mask bullet.
	
•	 Remove: Choose your sharpening algorithm. Gaussian Blur is the 
algorithm used for the Unsharp Mask command. Lens Blur detects 
detail in the image and attempts to respect the details while reducing 
the nasty halos that can occur with sharpening. Motion Blur tries to 
sharpen the blurring that occurs when your camera, or your subject, 
moves.
	
•	 Angle: Specify the direction of motion for the Motion Blur algorithm, 
described in the preceding Remove bullet.
	
•	 More Refined: Runs the algorithm more slowly than the default speed 
for better accuracy.
Working Intelligently with the Smart Brush Tools
The Smart Brush tools — Smart Brush and Detail Smart Brush — are two fun 
tools that enable you to selectively apply an image adjustment or special 
effects that then appear on all or part of your image. What’s great is that 
these adjustments and effects are applied via an adjustment layer, meaning 
that they “hover” over your layers and don’t permanently alter the pixels in 
your image. The adjustments can also be flexibly edited and deleted, if you 
so desire.
Using the Smart Brush
The Smart Brush tool allows you to paint a variety of image adjustments on 
all or just a portion of your image. The action of the tool is similar to that of 
Figure 2-20: The Adjust Sharpness command.

the Selection Brush — as you brush, you make a selection and adjust simul­
taneously. Follow these steps to use the Smart Brush tool:
	
	 1.	 Select the Smart Brush tool from the Tools panel in Edit Full mode.
	
	 The tool icon looks like a house paintbrush with an adjacent gear.
	
2.	 Choose your desired brush attributes, such as diameter and hardness, 
from the Brush Picker drop-down panel.
	
	 For more on working with brushes, see Book V, Chapter 1.
	
3.	 Select your desired adjustment category and then a particular preset 
adjustment from the Smart Paint panel, as shown in Figure 2-21.
	
	 Note that you can “tear off” this panel by grabbing the grip area in the 
upper-left corner of the panel and dragging it anywhere in your 
Application window (Windows) or on your screen (Mac). In the Smart 
Paint menu, choose adjustments ranging from photographic effects, 
such as a vintage Yellowed Photo, to nature effects, such as Sunset 
(which gives a warm, orange glow to your image).

4.	 Paint an adjustment on a layer in your image.
	
	 Note that while you paint, the Smart Brush tool attempts to detect edges 
in your image and snaps to those edges. In addition, while you brush, a 
selection border appears.
	
	 A new adjustment layer is automatically created with your first paint 
stroke. The accompanying layer mask also appears on that adjustment 
layer. For more on adjustment layers, see Book VI, Chapter 1.
	
5.	 Using the Add and Subtract Smart Brush modes, fine-tune your 
adjusted area by adding and subtracting from it.
	
	 When you add and subtract from your adjusted area, you’re essentially 
modifying your layer mask. Adding to the adjusted area adds white to 
the layer mask, and subtracting from an adjusted area adds black to the 
layer mask. For more on layer masks, see Book VI, Chapter 4.
	
6.	 Select a different preset adjustment for your selected area, if you want.
	
	 In fact, try them all out before you make your final choice.
	
7.	 If you feel you need to refine your selected area, choose the Refine 
Edges option on the Options bar.
	
	 For more on Refine Edges, see Book IV, Chapter 2.
	
	 If you’d rather apply the adjustment to your unselected area, select the 
Inverse option on the Options bar.
	
	 If you want to modify your adjustment, double-click the Adjustment 
Layer pin on your image. The pin is annotated by a small, square black 
and red gear icon. After you double-click the pin, the dialog box corre­
sponding to your particular adjustment appears. For example, if you 
double-click the Shoebox photo adjustment (under Photographic), you 
access the Hue/Saturation dialog box.
	
8.	 Make your necessary adjustments in the dialog box and click OK.
	
	 You can also right-click (Control-click on the Mac) and select Change 
Adjustment Settings from the contextual menu that appears. Or, you can 
select Delete Adjustment and Hide Selection from the same menu.
	
9.	 After you finish, simply deselect your selection by choosing Select➪
Deselect.
	
You can add multiple Smart Brush adjustments. After you apply one effect, 
reset the Smart Brush tool and apply additional adjustments.
Getting accurate with the Detail Smart Brush
The Detail Smart Brush tool also enables you to paint various image adjust­
ments on all or part of your image. The action of the tool is similar to the 
regular Brush tool, enabling finer control than that of the Smart Brush. 
Follow these steps to use the Detail Smart Brush tool:

Book VIII

521
	
	 1.	 Select the Detail Smart Brush tool from the Tools panel in Edit Full 
mode.
	
	 This tool shares the flyout menu with the Smart Brush tool. The tool 
icon looks like an art paintbrush with an adjacent gear. You can also 
press the F key, or Shift+F, if the Smart Brush tool is visible.
	
2.	 Choose a brush tip preset and brush size as well as attributes from the 
Brushes drop-down panel.
	
	 Feel free to change your brush tip and size as needed to achieve the 
desired effect. For more on working with brushes, see Book V, Chapter 
1. For better accessibility, you can “tear off” this panel (and the Smart 
Paint panel in Step 3) by grabbing the grip area in the upper-left corner 
of the panel and dragging it anywhere in your Application window.
	
3.	 Select your desired adjustment category and then your particular pre­
set adjustment from the Smart Paint panel.
	
	 Several of the Special Effects adjustments are shown in Figure 2-22.

S
ometimes, working with just a single shot isn’t quite enough. Imagine 
this scenario: As much as you try, you just can’t quite squeeze that 
vacation scenic vista into one photo; in fact, it takes a total of three shots. 
Or one of your relations is always blinking or looking the wrong way in your 
family reunion snapshots, so no single shot ends up being the perfect group 
photo. Or maybe bystanders or cars keep crossing the path of your camera 
when you’re trying to capture that historic landmark. Not to worry, that’s 
what the Elements Photomerge commands are for. One command seam­
lessly stitches multiple shots of your panorama into a single image, 
while another eliminates distracting elements from your shots, 
and a third command enables you to combine multiple 
group shots to get the best composite. Finally, one com­
mand even lets you take two faces and combine them 
into a kind of hybrid human. (How cool is that?)
Stitching a Scene with 
Photomerge Panorama
The Photomerge Panorama command enables you to 
combine multiple images into a single panoramic 
image. You can take several overlapping photos, from 
skylines to mountain ranges, and stitch them together into 
one shot.
	
If you know your ultimate goal is to create a Photomerge composition, you 
can make things easier for yourself by making sure that when you shoot 
your photos, you overlap your individual images by 15 to 40 percent, but no 
more than 50 percent. Adobe also recommends that you avoid using 

524
Stitching a Scene with Photomerge Panorama
524
distortion lenses (such as a fish-eye) and that you also avoid using your 
camera’s zoom setting. Additionally, try to keep the same exposure settings 
for even lighting. Finally, try to stay in the same position and keep your cam­
era at the same level for each shot. Using a tripod and rotating the head can 
help you achieve this consistency. Note, however, that rotating the head 
may introduce a perspective distortion. This can be corrected during the 
“stitching” described in the steps below.
Follow these steps to assemble your own Photomerge Panorama 
composition:
	
1.	 In the Editor, in Edit Full mode, choose File➪New➪Photomerge 
Panorama.
	
2.	 In the first Photomerge dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-1, select your 
source files.
	
	 You can select from Files (which uses individual files you select) or from 
Folder (which uses all images in a folder) from the Use drop-down list. 
Click the Add Open Files button to use all currently open files. Or click 
the Browse button to navigate to certain files or folders.
Figure 3-1: Select the source files for your composition.
	
3.	 Under Layout, select a projection mode, as shown in Figure 3-1.
	
	 The thumbnail illustration visually demonstrates each mode, but we 
give you a little more description of each here:
	
•	 Auto: Using the Auto mode, Elements analyzes your images on 
its own.

•	 Perspective: Select this mode if your images have been shot with per­
spective or at acute angles. This is also a good mode to use if you’ve 
shot images using the tripod method described earlier in this section.
	
•	 Cylindrical: Select this option if you shot images with a wide-angle 
lens. This mode is also good for those 360-degree, full panoramic 
shots.
	
•	 Reposition Only: When you select this mode, Elements doesn’t take 
into account any distortion, but merely scans the images and posi­
tions them in what it considers the best position.
	
	 If you choose any of the preceding modes, Elements opens and auto­
matically assembles the source files to create the composite panorama 
in the work area of the dialog box. If it looks good, skip to Step 7.
	
	 Elements alerts you if it can’t automatically composite your source 
files. You then have to assemble the images manually by using the 
Interactive Layout mode.
	
•	 Interactive Layout: This option opens the work area pane. Elements 
tries to align and stitch the images the best it can, but you may have 
to manually complete or adjust the panorama, as shown in Figure 3-2. 
If you choose the Interactive Layout option, proceed to Step 4.
	
	 Note that, with any of the modes, Elements leaves your merged image in 
layers. Also notice that a layer mask has been added to each layer to better 
blend the panoramic image. For more on layer masks, see Book VI.
	
4.	 If Elements hasn’t already done so, drag the image thumbnails from 
the lightbox area (the small white area at the top) onto the work area 
with the Select Image tool (the arrow).
	
	 Alternatively, double-click the lightbox thumbnail to add it to the 
composition.
	
5.	 Arrange and position your images using one or more of the following 
tools:
	
•	 Select Image tool: Positions the images
	
•	 Rotate Image tool: Makes rotations
	
•	 Zoom and Move View tools: Help view and navigate around your pan­
orama, respectively
	
•	 Navigator View box: Zooms into and out of your composition when 
you drag the slider
	
•	 Snap to Image option: Enables overlapping images to automatically 
snap into place

6.	 To adjust the Vanishing Point, first select the Perspective option in the 
Settings area and click the image with the Set Vanishing Point tool.
	
	 A vanishing point is the point on the horizon where perspective planes 
recede and eventually converge. By default, Elements selects the center 
image as the vanishing point. If necessary, you can move the 
other images.
	
	 Note that when you select the Perspective setting, Elements links 
non–Vanishing Point images to the Vanishing Point image. To break 
the link, click the Normal Setting button or separate the images in the 
work area.
	
7.	 Click OK to create the panorama.

Getting the Best Shot with Photomerge Group Shot
Getting a group of people to smile, not blink or fidget, and look in the same 
direction is about as easy as herding cats. With Elements, you no longer 
have to worry about snapping the perfect group shot anymore. Just take a 
bunch of shots and later create the ultimate perfect shot by compositing 
those shots using Photomerge Group Shot.
Here are the steps to create a Photomerge Group Shot image:
	
1.	 In any of the Edit modes, select two or more photos from your Project 
Bin at the bottom of your Application window.
	
2.	 Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Group Shot.
	
	 The Photomerge Group Shot dialog box appears.
	
3.	 Take your best overall group shot and drag it from the Project Bin 
onto the Final pane.
	
4.	 Select another photo in the Project Bin to use as your Source image 
and then drag it to the Source pane.

5.	 With the Pencil tool, draw a line around the portions of the Source 
photo you want to merge into your Final photo, as shown in Figure 3-4.
	
	 In the Options area on the right side of the dialog box, you can choose 
to show the yellow pencil strokes (Show Strokes) or show regions (Show 
Regions), which are then highlighted with a blue overlay. Use the Eraser 
tool to remove any portions you don’t want merged onto the final image.
	
6.	 Repeat Steps 4 and 5 with any remaining photos.
	
	 If your photos aren’t aligned, you can use the Alignment tool under 
Advanced Options.
	
7.	 Using the Alignment tool, click the Source image and position the 
three target markers on three key locations.
	
	 Do the same on the final image and choose similar locations.
	
	 You can click the Pixel Blending option to better blend pixels.
	
8.	 Click the Align Photos button.
	
	 Again, as with Photomerge Panorama, the more similar in framing, size, 
lighting, and so on, that your source and final images are, the better the 
merged result.

Eliminating with Photomerge Scene Cleaner
Photomerge Scene Cleaner sounds like a covert job with the CIA where you 
spend your days mopping up evidence at crime scenes, but it isn’t quite that 
intriguing. This Photomerge command toolset enables you to create the opti­
mum image by allowing you to eliminate annoying distractions, such as cars, 
passersby, and so on.
To get the best Source images for a “clean scene,” be sure to take multiple 
shots of your scene from the same angle and distance. It also works best 
when the elements you want to eliminate are moving.
Follow these steps to create a Photomerge Scene Cleaner composite:
	
1.	 Select two or more photos from your Project Bin.
	
2.	 Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Scene Cleaner in any of the Edit modes.
	
	 The Photomerge Scene Cleaner dialog box appears.
	
	 Elements attempts to auto-align your images the best it can.
	
3.	 Take your best overall shot of the scene and drag it from the Project 
Bin onto the Final pane.

photo that you want to be replaced by content from the Source photo, 
as shown in Figure 3-8.
	
6.	 Repeat Steps 4 and 5 with the remaining shots of the scene.
	
	 If your photos aren’t aligned, you can use the Alignment tool under the

7.	 Using the Alignment tool, click the Source image and position the 
three target markers on three key locations.
	
	 Do the same on the Final image, choosing similar locations.

	 Again, as with the other Photomerge commands, the more similar the 
starting source images (similar framing, similar angle, similar lighting), 
the better the merged result will be.

The cleaned-up image opens as a new file in Elements. You have to admit, for 
a command that’s so easy to use, the results are pretty impressive, as shown 
in Figure 3-9.
	
Be sure to check the perimeter edges of your composite image carefully. You 
may have some strange artifacts or blurring caused by the aligning of the 
multiple images. Execute a quick crop with the Cropping tool and you’re 
good to go.
Figure 3-9: A clean scene, free of any annoying distractions.
Photomerge Exposure
	
Occasionally, you need to capture a shot that presents an exposure 
challenge — your foreground and background require different exposure 
settings. This often occurs in shots that are backlit. For example, you have
a person in front of an indoor window in the day or someone in front of a lit 
nighttime cityscape or sunset. With Photomerge Exposure, you can take 
photos with two different exposure settings and let the command blend them 
together for the perfect shot.

534
Photomerge Exposure
534
You can capture your shots using exposure bracketing (shooting at consecutive 
exposure camera settings) or with a flash and then without. Elements can 
detect all these camera settings. We recommend that you use a tripod to 
keep your shots as aligned as possible. This will help the blending algorithm 
do a better job.
Here’s how to use this new command:
	
1.	 Select two or more photos from your Project Bin.
	
2.	 Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Exposure in any of the Edit modes.
	
	 You can also perform this task in the Organizer, or in Adobe Bridge on 
the Mac. Just select any two images and choose the same command.
	
3.	 If you’ve used a tripod or have just done a good job keeping your 
shots aligned, leave the mode on Automatic.
	
	 Select the Simple Blending option, and Elements automatically blends 
the two images. Select the Smart Blending option to access sliders to 
adjust the Highlights, Shadows, and Saturation settings for finer tuning 
of the resulting images. If you mess up things, click the Reset button.
	
4.	 If you feel the need for even more control, click the Manual mode tab.
	
5.	 In Manual mode, choose your first shot from the Project Bin and drag 
it to the Final window.
	
	 If your other image isn’t already the Source image, drag it from the 
Project Bin to the Source window.
	
6.	 With the Pencil tool, draw over the well-exposed areas you wish to 
retain in the Source image.
	
	 As you draw, your Final image shows the incorporation of those drawn 
areas, as shown in Figure 3-10.
	
7.	 If you mistakenly draw over something you didn’t want to, grab the 
Eraser tool and erase the Pencil tool marks.
	
	 Choose to have your preview show strokes and/or regions.
	
8.	 Further control the blending by dragging the Transparency slider.
	
	 Dragging to the right will blend less of the Source areas into the Final 
image. Check the Edge blending option to get an even better blend of the 
two images.
	
9.	 If your photos aren’t aligning correctly, grab the Alignment tool under 
Advanced Options:
	
a.	 With the Alignment tool, click your Source image and position the three 
target markers on three key locations.
	
b.	 Do the same on the Final image, choosing similar locations.

W
ouldn’t it be nice if you could have a mentor sitting behind you who 
could walk you through the necessary steps each time you encoun­
tered a new feature in a program?
Photoshop Elements doesn’t provide you with a robot mentor 
to instruct you on the best way to perform an edit, but it 
does offer you the next best thing in the form of the 
Guided Edit panel.
The Guided Edit panel provides you easy control 
over some important editing tasks that you perform 
routinely when working on images. In this chapter, 
we show you how to use the Guided Edit panel and 
all it has to offer you.
Understanding Guided Mode
You see all the guided actions and activities in the Guided 
Edit panel in Edit Guided mode. Choose Edit Guided from 
the Edit Tab drop-down list in the top right of the Application 
window. The Guided Edit panel opens to display the items shown 
in Figure 4-1.

Understanding Guided Mode
538
As you can see in Figure 4-1, the 
Guided Edit panel has seven catego­
ries. Below each category title, you find 
some items that relate to the respec­
tive category. The categories include
	
✓	Basic Photo Edits: Here you find 
the kinds of edits frequently used 
on photos. Cropping images, 
straightening photos, and sharpen­
ing photos are part of this group.
	
✓	Lighting and Exposure: Almost all 
photos you either take with cam­
eras or scan from printed pictures 
require some lighting adjustments. 
You find lighten, darken, as well as 
brightness and contrast controls 
here. In addition, it offers help to 
use Levels for more brightness and 
contrast adjustments.
	
✓	Color Correction: Another fre­
quently used edit involves adjust­
ing color. You can enhance colors, 
remove color casts, and correct 
skin tones using these items.
	
✓	Guided Activities: This item helps 
you make adjustments for enhanc­
ing images with instructions for 
removing scratches, blemishes, 
tear marks, and correcting distor­
tions. Guide for Editing a Photo 
walks you through several edits for 
cropping, brightness adjustments, 
enhancing, and touchups.
	
✓	Photomerge: Photomerge is used 
for merging photos. The subcate­
gories include help with merging 
group shots or pictures with faces. It shows you how to remove 
obstructing objects from a group of merged photos using the Scene 
Cleaner.

✓	Automated Actions: A host of different sequences are assembled 
together as actions. You can, for example, choose one or a group of 
photos and apply a sepia tone with just one mouse click. The action 
then applies several editing steps automatically to create a good result.
	
✓	Photographic Effects: Using this guide, you can easily apply a variety of 
different filters that produce many different effects, such as line draw­
ings, transformation of your image into an old-fashioned photo, or satu­
rated film effects.
Basic Photo Edits
The commands in this category help you perform the kinds of basic edits 
frequently used in most of your Elements editing sessions. When you choose 
Crop Photo, for example, the Guided Edit panel opens with the Crop tool 
selected and a crop frame drawn on the photo. Instructions that make it 
easy for you to crop an image appear in the Guided Edit panel.
Similar steps are also provided for straightening a photo. You might use this 
feature frequently when scanning photos. The new Recompose command 
allows you to intelligently resize an image without losing any vital content.
The last item listed under Basic Photo Edits is Sharpen Photo. This is 
another edit you make frequently when working on your photos in Elements. 
To get a feel for using the Sharpen Photo item in Edit Guided mode, do the 
following:
	
1.	 Open a photo in Edit Guided mode.
	
2.	 In the Guided Edit panel, in the Basic Photo Edits category, click 
Sharpen Photo.
	
	 The panel changes to display the options you have for sharpening a 
photo.
	
3.	 Change the view in the Image window.
	
	 By default, you see your photo appear in the Image window in a maxi­
mized view. You can view your photo with a before/after effect where 
the original photo appears unedited on the left side of the window and 
the edits you apply appear on the right side of the window. To create a 
before/after effect, click the up-pointing arrow where you see After Only 
at the bottom of the panel. When you click the up-pointing arrow, the 
icon changes to two icons adjacent to each other and the name changes 
to Before & After – Horizontal, as shown in Figure 4-2.

Lighting and Exposure
540
Figure 4-2: Click After Only, and you can see a before/after display of the original and the 
edited version beside each other.
	
	 If you want to view the before/after images vertically, click the Before & 
After – Horizontal icon, and the view changes to the Before & After – 
Vertical icon, with the Before image appearing vertically on top of the 
After image.
	
4.	 Adjust the sharpening slider.
	
	 You have the option of clicking the Auto button, and Elements makes a 
best-guess adjustment to sharpen the image. To manually sharpen the 
image, move the slider left and right.
	
5.	 Click Done to apply the edits.
The advantage you have in using the Guided Edit panel is that some helpful 
information is offered to guide you through the edits. Note that in the panel 
shown in Figure 4-2, you see a tip informing you that it’s best to view your 
photo in a 100% view when you apply sharpening to a photo.
Lighting and Exposure
One of the most important and most-frequent edits you make on photos is 
adjusting lighting and exposure. When you click Lighting and Exposure and 
view the options, the first two items you see deal with handling Lighten/

Lighting and Exposure
541
Book VIII
Chapter 4

Darken and Brightness/Contrast issues. 
Clicking one of these items changes the 
panel view to one where you can move 
sliders similar to those you have for 
sharpening adjustments. The tweaks 
you can do here are pretty straightfor­
ward and, with the help offered in the 
panel, it’s intuitive and easy to make 
these kinds of adjustments.
Things get a bit more complicated when 
you start using the Levels adjustment. 
We go into quite a bit of detail about 
Levels in Book VIII, Chapter 2. Be sure 
to read that chapter when you want to 
figure out more about using this impor­
tant dialog box.
	
When you use Levels, it’s commonly 
used on adjustment layers. You find 
more information on creating and 
using adjustment layers in Book VI, 
Chapter 1.
Creating an adjustment layer and 
applying settings from the Levels dia­
log box can be a little confusing when 
you first start correcting lighting and 
exposure. The Guided Edit panel, fortu­
nately, breaks down the complicated 
steps into easy-to-follow instructions 
to assist you in making the edits.
When you click Adjust Levels in the 
Guided Edit panel, the panel view 
changes to what you see in Figure 4-3. 
Here you find helpful information 
explaining how the Levels dialog box is 
used and what the histograms mean. 
When you start with this edit, it’s a 
good idea to read all the help informa­
tion before making the adjustments.
Figure 4-3: The Adjust Levels panel.

After reading the information contained in the panel, click the Create Levels 
Adjustment Layer button and then the New Layer dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 4-4.
 
Figure 4-4: The New Layer dialog box.
Type a name for the new adjustment layer and then click OK; the Levels dia­
log box opens, as shown in Figure 4-5.

Color Correction
543
Book VIII
Chapter 4
Getting Help in 
Guided Mode
From the information you obtained in the Guided Edit panel, move the 
sliders in the Levels dialog box to make your corrections.
Color Correction
The three items you find in the Color 
Correction panel help you improve the 
color in your photos. When you click 
the Enhance Colors item, the panel 
changes to provide you with sliders to 
adjust hue, saturation, and brightness. 
Click the Remove a Color Cast link and 
you find an Eyedropper tool where you 
can sample a medium gray tone, and 
Elements corrects color in the image. 
For more information on removing col­
orcasts, see Book VIII, Chapter 2.
One of the most important color 
adjustments you can make is adjusting 
skin tones. The Adjust Skin Tones 
panel, as shown in Figure 4-6, provides 
you with an Eyedropper tool. Click an 
area in the image representing a neu­
tral skin tone, and the color is adjusted 
to match that neutral tone for the 
entire image.
	
When adjusting skin tones, it’s a good 
idea to select only the areas you want 
to correct for color adjustments. Look 
over Book IV, Chapter 1 to determine 
how to make selections.
You can tweak the color for skin tones 
by moving the sliders in the panel.
Figure 4-6: Click the Eyedropper tool and 
then click a skin tone in the photo.

Guided Activities
544
Guided Activities
Guided Activities in the Guided Edit 
panel provides you with several differ­
ent options. When you click Touch Up 
Scratches, Blemishes, or Tear Marks, 
the Touch Up Photo panel opens, as 
shown in Figure 4-7.
Move the sliders respective to the 
edits you want to make. As with other 
panels, you find some help information 
to guide you through the steps. We 
cover much more on touching up 
images in Book VIII, Chapters 1 and 2.
If you move down the Guided Activities 
list and click Guide for Editing a Photo, 
the Guided Edit panel changes to first 
display the Crop panel. Make a choice 
for cropping an image and click the 
Next button. Move on to Recompose, 
which enables you to resize an image 
without losing vital content. Click Next 
to move on to Lighten or Darken a 
Photo. Click Next and move on to the 
Touch Up Photo panel, and so on. This 
panel is one that takes you through the 
entire editing process, and what you 
find in each step is a duplicate of many 
of the other panels discussed in this 
chapter.
The Fix Keystone Distortion panel helps 
you correct problems with architectural 
photography with parallax distortion. 
To understand the distortion problem, 
Figure 4-7: The Touch Up Photo panel.

Automated Actions

look over Figure 4-8. The image pre­
views show you a sample photo (at the 
top of the panel) and the result of apply­
ing the correction (in the bottom photo 
in the panel).
Photomerge
We devote a complete chapter to 
Photomerge in Book VIII, Chapter 3 so 
we won’t go into the steps to produce 
a photo merged from other photos in 
this chapter. The Photomerge panel 
helps you walk through all the steps 
we explain there.
You select several photos you want to 
merge and then use the Photomerge 
panel to align and merge the photos. 
The content of your images can be 
scenes or faces. The Scene Cleaner is 
used to remove items that distract 
from the merged scene. The new 
Exposure command enables you to get 
the perfect shot by blending multiple 
shots taken with different exposure 
settings.
Automated Actions
The Action Player is like having a tape 
recorder play a recorded series of 
steps to produce a result. You might 
have one effect that requires creating a 
layer, adjusting brightness on the new 
layer, changing layer opacity, adjusting 
hue/saturation and brightness, adding 
some noise, applying a filter, and 
Figure 4-8: Correcting keystone distortion.

Automated Actions

flattening the layers. Rather than perform each step manually, you can use 
the Action Player that applies multiple edits with one mouse click.
To see how the Action Player is used, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open a photo in Edit Guided mode.
	
2.	 In the Guided Edit panel, in the Automated Actions category, click 
Action Player to open the Action Player panel.
	
3.	 Choose an action from the first drop-down list.
	
	 In our example, we chose Special Effects.
	
4.	 Select the action to run from the second drop-down list.
	
5.	 Click Play Action.
	
	 Elements performs all the steps necessary to create the result. In our 
example, when we choose to run Sepia Toning, the action creates the 
image shown in Figure 4-9.
	
6.	 Click Done.

Photographic Effects
Photographic effects are like applying filters that we cover extensively in 
Book VII, Chapters 1 and 2. Whereas the Filters panel provides you with many 
different options to apply a filter, the Guided Edit panel offers you filter effects 
and then takes you through steps for adjusting brightness values, changing 
hue/saturation, and making other adjustments to perfect the result.
You can choose from three different options for applying Photographic 
Effects. Line Drawing converts your photos to a pen-and-ink drawing. Old 
Fashioned Photo gives your images a vintage appearance, and Saturated 
Slide Film Effect provides you a way to simulate colors of the saturated film 
used in film cameras (as opposed to digital cameras).
To experiment a little, take a look at the Old Fashioned Photo option and fol­
low these steps to produce an image with a vintage appearance:
	
1.	 Open an image in Edit Guided mode.
	
2.	 In the Guided Edit panel, in the Photographic Effects category, click 
Old Fashioned Photo to open the Create an Old Fashioned Photo 
panel, as shown in Figure 4-10.

	 This panel offers you several but­
tons to click to convert the photo. 
Scroll the panel and read the help 
information; then click the buttons 
to make the choices you want.
	
3.	 Select the option for conversion 
to black and white.
	
	 Scroll the panel and look over the 
options you have for converting 
the photo to black and white. Click 
one of the three buttons — 
Newspaper, Urban/Snapshots, or 
Vivid Landscapes, as shown in 
Figure 4-11.
	
4.	 Add tonality and texture.
 	
	 Scroll the panel until you see the 
Adjust Tonality and Add Texture 
buttons, as shown in Figure 4-12. 
Click both buttons.
	
5.	 Adjust hue/saturation.
	
	 Scroll the list and click the Adjust 
Hue/Saturation button. The Hue/
Saturation dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 4-13. To change 
the color, move the Hue slider. 
Move the Saturation and Lightness 
sliders to apply more or less satu­
ration and change the brightness 
values.
	
	 Even though you converted your 
photo to black and white in step 3, 
the color mode remained in an 
RGB mode. Notice that the 
Colorize check box is checked in 
Figure 4-13. Be sure to keep this 
check box checked to add a color 
tint to the photo.
	
6.	 Click Done.
	
	 The result of applying all the edits 
is shown in Figure 4-14.

Creating and 
Sharing with 
Elements

P
hotos are meant to be shared with others or 
printed using both desktop and professional 
printing devices. In this book, we take you 
through the journey of sharing photos online and 
using an Adobe partner sharing service that can 
help you create professional-looking 
presentations.
We cover all you need to know about printing 
your pictures, managing the color, and using color 
profiles. We also give you the lowdown on Web-
hosting images.

A
dobe Photoshop Elements offers you a number of creations that can 
be shared onscreen or in print. From both the Create and Share panels 
in the Panel Bin in the Organizer and from within both editing modes, you 
have a number of menu choices for producing creations designed for 
sharing.
In Book IX, Chapter 3, we look at creating files for screen and Web 
viewing. In this chapter, we talk about creations designed for 
print and sharing.
Getting a Handle on Creations
In Book IX, Chapter 4, we talk about online albums, 
attaching files to e-mail, using photo mail, and using 
online sharing services. All these creations offer dif­
ferent output options, such as e-mailing, burning 
files to a disc, and creating HTML documents — as 
well as printing and PDF creation — and you create 
them all using the Share panel.
You work with the remaining creations — photo books, 
photo collages, photo calendars, greeting cards, print labels, 
and photo stamps — by choosing options from the Create panel, 
as shown in Figure 1-1. All these creations are designed for output to your 
printer or for sending files to an online printing service or to friends and 
family.

554
Getting a Handle on Creations
	
When you make a creation that will 
ultimately be sent to an online service 
or shared with other users, keep in 
mind that you first must select the pho­
tos you want in your creation. For 
example, creating a photo book by 
clicking the Photo Book button in the 
Create panel first requires you to let 
Elements know what photos are to be 
used in your photo book. If you happen 
to click a button and nothing happens, 
more than likely you haven’t selected 
any photos.
Many creation options follow a similar 
set of steps to produce a file that will 
be shared with other users or sent to 
an online printing service. In the 
Project Bin, you find all you need to 
make a new project. It gives you 
choices for layouts and producing a 
creation. Some of the choices from 
both the Create and Share panels are
	
✓	Layout options: Select some pho­
tos in the Organizer and click an 
item, such as Photo Book, to make 
the Create panel change to the 
Project view. This view displays 
some information about making a 
new creation.
	
✓	Auto-Fill with Project Bin Photos: 
This check box is selected by 
default, and the files you see in the 
Project Bin are added to your 
project.
	
✓	Include Captions: Select this 
check box if you want the photo 
captions to appear on each page below their respective photos.
	
✓	Number of Pages: Elements automatically creates the number of pages 
to accommodate the number of photos you selected in the Organizer. 
Note that some creations require a minimum number of photos to pro­
duce a project. Photo Book, for example, requires a minimum of 18 pages.
After assembling your creation, click the Create button. Elements then incor­
porates the selected photos into the layout and theme you specified in the 
panel. Be patient and wait for Elements to complete the task.

Creating a Photo Book
After a creation has been made, the document appears like any other image 
you open in Elements. You can crop, modify, print, and more. Using an 
Elements file, choose File➪Save to open the Save As dialog box. Type a name 
and click Save.
Creating a Photo Book
Elements provides some fancy ways to create pages for a photo album. The 
Photo Book Creation panel offers many different options for choosing page 
templates, adding artwork and type, printing your album pages, or sending 
the files to an online service for professional printing.
Follow these steps to create a photo book:
	
1.	 Select files in the Organizer and click the Create tab (Windows) or 
open several photos in Edit Full mode (Windows/Mac) and click 
Create.
	
	 The procedure for all creations is the same. You first select files in the 
Organizer (Windows) or an editing mode (Windows or Mac) and then 
click the Create tab in the Panel Bin. Ideally, it’s best to create an album, 
as we explain in Book II, Chapter 2, and click the album to display the 
album photos in the Organizer window. But remember, after you display 
an album in the Organizer, you still need to select all the photos.
	
	 To select all photos shown in an Organizer window, press Ctrl+A.
	
2.	 Click Photo Book in the Create panel.
	
	 Regardless of whether you’re working in the Organizer or an editing 
mode, the Photo Book option is available in the same Create panel. 
When you click Photo Book, the order system for Shutterfly opens. 
Shutterfly is an online order supplier where you can order prints of pho­
tos and have them shipped back to you and any other individuals you 
may wish to share your photos with.
	
	 Regardless of whether you’re working in the Organizer or an editing 
mode, the Photo Book option is available in the same Create panel. The 
Create panel changes to the first of several panes that walk you through 
the steps to create a photo book. If you start in the Organizer, clicking 
Photo Book in the Create panel opens your selected photos in Edit Full 
mode.
	
3.	 Choose a photo book option from the Order Shutterfly Wizard.
	
	 The Shutterfly Wizard displays server options for ordering a photo book, 
as shown in Figure 1-2. Click one of the Create Now buttons for the type of 
book you want to order.
	
	 The next screen offers you several options for a cover style.

Prints in the Create panel, the Kodak Order Prints logon window opens, simi­
lar to the screen shown in Figure 1-12.
Figure 1-12: The Kodak Order Calendar order page.
After you log on to Kodak Order Calendar (click the Sign In button if you 
have an account or fill in the text boxes to create a new account), the files 
you selected earlier are uploaded and you see an order page similar to the 
one in Figure 1-12. Choose from the different print-size options and specify 
the quantity for each print. As you navigate through the order process, you 
can identify other recipients for your order and have copies of the calendars 
mailed back to you and sent to others.
Getting in Touch with Greeting Cards
You can create greeting cards in a snap in Photoshop Elements by using the 
Greeting Card panel. Here’s how to do it:

ing though the post office.
Here’s the simple, easy way to use Elements to place an order for your very 
own personal postage stamps:
	
1.	 Select an image in the Organizer.
	
	 Your file needs to be less than 5MB. (See Book III, Chapter 1 for more on 
resizing images.)
	
2.	 Click Create in the Panel Bin and then choose PhotoStamps from the 
More Options drop-down list.
	
	 The PhotoStamps dialog box opens.
	
3.	 Click the Upload My Photos button in the dialog box (see Figure 1-15).
	
	 Your photo is uploaded to the PhotoStamps.com Web site.

Getting Organized with CD/DVD Labels
Another creation option in Elements is a simple, easy way to create CD and 
DVD labels. From the Create panel, choose a menu item for CD Jacket, DVD 
Jacket, or CD/DVD Label from the More Options drop-down list. From tem­
plates provided in the panel, Elements offers you an easy method for print­
ing your own, personalized labels and jackets for CDs and DVDs.
	
This feature for printing CD/DVD labels is a bit weak in Elements. You may 
need to fiddle around quite a bit to get the images to fit a label. Using some 
templates provided by label developers is often a much better method for 
printing labels.
Creating a VCD with Menu (Windows)
Select a slide show project and open the Create panel. From the More 
Options drop-down list, choose VCD with Menu. The Create a VCD with 
Menu dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 1-16. Select a project, make a 
choice for NTSC or PAL format, and click Burn. The file created is a Video CD

✓	Exploring other print options
P
erhaps the greatest challenge for individuals using programs like 
Photoshop Elements (and even for the professionals who use its grand­
daddy, Adobe Photoshop) is turning what you see on your monitor into a 
reasonable facsimile on a printed page. You can find all sorts of books on 
color printing — how to get color right, how to calibrate your equipment, 
and how to create and use color profiles — all for the purpose of getting a 
good match between your computer monitor and your printer. It’s down­
right discouraging to spend a lot of time tweaking an image so 
that all the brilliant blue colors jump out on your com­
puter monitor, only to find that all those blues turn to 
murky purples when the photo is printed.
If you’ve already read Book III, Chapters 1 and 2, 
you’re ahead of the game because you know a 
little bit about color management, color pro­
files, and printer resolutions. After you check 
out those chapters, your next step is to get to 
know your printer or your print service center 
and understand how to correctly print your 
pictures.
In this chapter, we talk about options — many 
options — for setting print attributes for printing to 
your own color printer. We also toss in some tips on 
how to get better results when you’re using print service cen­
ters. If you need to, reread this chapter a few times just to be certain 
that you understand the process for printing good-quality images. A little 
time spent here will, we hope, save you some headaches down the road.

Getting Images Ready for Printing
Getting Images Ready for Printing
The first step toward getting your photos to your desktop printer or to a 
printing service is to prepare each image for optimum output. You have 
several considerations when you’re preparing files, including the ones in 
this list:
	
✓	Set resolution and size. Before you print a file, use the Image Size dialog 
box (Image➪Resize➪Image Size) to set your image size and the optimum 
resolution for your printer. Files that have too much resolution can print 
images that are inferior to files optimized for a printer. See your print­
er’s documentation for recommendations for resolution. As a general 
rule, 300 ppi (pixels per inch) works best for most printers printing on 
high-quality paper. If you print on plain paper, you often find that lower 
resolutions work just as well or even better.
	
✓	Make all brightness and color corrections before printing. It stands to 
reason that you want to make sure that your pictures appear their best 
before sending them off to your printer. If you have your monitor prop­
erly calibrated, as we discuss in Book III, Chapter 4, you should see a fair 
representation of what your pictures will look like after they are printed.
	
✓	Decide how color will be managed before you print. You can color-
manage output to your printer in three ways, as we discuss in the next 
section. Know your printer’s profiles and how to use them before you 
start to print your files.
	
✓	Get your printer ready. Finally, when printing to desktop color printers, 
always be certain your ink cartridges have ink and the nozzles are clean. 
Make sure you use the proper settings for paper and ink when you send 
a file to your printer. Be sure to review the manual that came with your 
printer to become aware of how to perform all the steps required to 
make a quality print.
Setting Print Options
As you might expect, you print files from Elements by choosing File➪Print. 
Depending on what workspace you have open, you can set print options in 
the Print dialog box from the Organizer or from within Edit Full mode. The 
different modes provide you with some different options, so we want to look 
at printing from both the Organizer and Edit Full mode.
You have a number of different settings to adjust when printing color pho­
tos, as we explain a little later in the section “Printing with Color Profiles.” 
For now, take a look at the different options you have in the print dialog 
boxes you open from the Organizer and from Edit Full mode.

options from within Adobe Bridge, but they’re limited to printing contact 
sheets and picture packages. For printing individual photos on the 
Macintosh, you need to open the photos in Elements.
You can select one or more images in the Organizer and then choose 
File➪Print. The images selected when you choose the Print command 
appear in a scrollable list, as shown in Figure 2-1.

Using Page Setup
When you click the Page Setup button in the Prints dialog box, the Page 
Setup dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-3. In this dialog box, you can 
make a few selections for print attributes that may be unique to your printer. 
However, for most desktop printers, the options you find in the Page Setup

When printing photos from the Organizer, click the More Options button 
in the Prints dialog box. The More Options dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 2-4.
If you’ve used Photoshop Elements prior to version 8, you’ll notice that the 
More Options dialog box has changed. As shown in Figure 2-4, you have 
three categories listed in the left pane. The first item — Printing Choices — 
is similar to what was available in earlier versions of Elements. The next two 
items — Custom Print Size and Color Management — have been moved from 
the Prints dialog box to the More Options dialog box.

Printing from Edit Full mode
If you want to print a photo while in Edit Full mode, choose File➪Print and 
the Print dialog box opens. The Print dialog box in Edit Full mode in 
Elements 8 is identical to the Print dialog box you use when printing from 
the Organizer. On the Macintosh, you find the same settings (see Figure 2-5) 
as Windows with the exception of the Select Type of Print drop-down list 
and Print Settings. You make the menu choices for contact sheets and pic­
ture packages from within Adobe Bridge.

Printing Multiple Images
Printing Multiple Images
You have choices in the Organizer or Edit Full mode for choosing a com­
mand for printing multiple images as either a contact sheet or picture pack­
age. On Windows, when you choose to print a contact sheet or picture 
package from within Edit Full mode, Elements switches you to the Organizer 
view. You continue as an action from the Organizer and leave Edit Full mode. 
On the Macintosh, you make the same choices from within Adobe Bridge 
that changes your view to Edit Full mode.
Printing contact sheets
Contact sheets in traditional photography were used to get a print from a 
roll of film. Rather than viewing negatives, a photographer could see a 
thumbnail print of each frame on a roll in a few contact sheets. These 
revealed how the frames would appear when printed.
You can get the same results in Elements by printing contact sheets from a 
collection of photos. When you can look over the thumbnails and choose 
which photos to print at larger sizes, you’re saving money on your printer 
consumables.
To print a contact sheet, do the following:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer (Windows) or Adobe Bridge (Macintosh).
	
2.	 In the Organizer/Bridge, select the photos you want to print on a 
contact sheet.
	
	 Press Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Macintosh) to choose multiple photos in 
a noncontiguous selection. You can also sort photos by keyword tags, 
albums, dates, and so on. You then select all the sorted photos by press­
ing Ctrl+A. For more information on sorting files, see Book II, Chapter 2.
	
3.	 In Windows, choose File➪Print or press Ctrl+P. On the Macintosh, 
choose Tools➪Photoshop Elements➪Contact Sheet II in Adobe Bridge.
	
	 In Windows, the Print Photos dialog box opens. In the dialog box, select 
the printer you want to use for your output from the Select Printer drop-
down list.
	
	 On the Macintosh, you switch to Elements in Edit Full mode and see the 
Contact Sheet dialog box, where you make your choices and then click 
OK. After that, the contact sheet is assembled. Choose File➪Print or 
press Ô+P to print the contact sheet.
	
4.	 Choose Contact Sheet from the Select Type of Print drop-down list.
	
	 The Prints dialog box refreshes to show your contact sheet options, as 
shown in Figure 2-6 (Windows).

Printing Multiple Images
Printing picture packages
Another option you have for printing multiple photos is picture packages. 
This feature prints multiple copies of the same photo or multiple copies of 
many photos.
A picture package is typically a single sheet of paper with the same photo 
printed at different sizes — something like your graduation photos or prom 
photos. You can choose to print a single picture package from one photo 
selected in the Organizer, or you can select multiple photos and print them 
all as multiple picture packages.
To create a picture package, do the following:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer (Windows) or Adobe Bridge (Macintosh).
	
2.	 Select a single photo or multiple photos in the Organizer that you 
want to print as a picture package(s).
	
3.	 In Windows, choose File➪Print or press Ctrl+P. On the Macintosh in 
Adobe Bridge, choose Tools➪Photoshop Elements➪Picture Package.
	
	 In Windows, the Prints dialog box opens. From the Select Printer drop-
down list, choose the printer you want to use for your output.
	
	 On the Macintosh, you see the Elements Picture Package dialog box, 
where you make the choices corresponding to the following steps, after 
which the picture package is assembled for you. After Elements finishes 
the assembly, choose File➪Print or press Ô+P.
	
4.	 Choose Picture Package from the Select Type of Print drop-down list.
	
	 The Print Photos dialog box refreshes to show your picture package 
options.
	
5.	 Choose a layout.
	
	 Choose a layout from the Select a Layout drop-down list. As you make 
layout selections, you see a dynamic preview of the picture package, as 
shown in Figure 2-7. Select different layouts to examine the results and 
choose the layout you want for your picture package.
	
6.	 Select a frame.
	
	 The photos can be printed with a frame. Choose an option from the 
Select a Frame drop-down list or leave the default None selected to print 
no frame on the photos.
	
7.	 Click More Options.
	
	 Choose a color profile from the same dialog box that appears when you 
print a contact sheet.
	
8.	 Click OK.
	
9.	 In the Print Photos dialog box, click Print.

Printing with Color Profiles
All the options we’ve talked about so far in this chapter give you a picture on 
paper, but even if you follow all the steps up to this point to a T, you may 
still not get the color right. You need to do more than adjust the settings in 
the Print Photos and Print dialog boxes to print the most accurate color you 
can on your printer. To do so requires using printer profiles that are created 
for every printer, paper, and ink set you use.
	
Printer profiles are created by printer developers for use with their inks and 
papers. If you decide to modify your printer and use large ink bottles or use 
lower-cost inks from third-party suppliers, the profiles shipped by your 
printer developer aren’t optimized for the change in ink pigments. Likewise, 
third-party papers aren’t optimized for the printer profiles shipped by your 
printer developer. In order to get accurate color when you use inks and 
papers different from those recommended by your printer developer, you 
may need to develop custom profiles for each ink set and each paper. You 
can find several sources of services that create custom profiles for you by 
searching the Internet.
Working with color printer profiles
In Book III, Chapter 4, we talk about creating color profiles for your monitor 
and selecting a color workspace. The final step in a color-managed workflow 
is to convert color from the profile of your color workspace to the color 

580
Printing to Inkjet Printers
profile of your printer. Basically, this conversion means that the colors you 
see on your monitor in your current workspace are accurately converted to 
the color that can be reproduced by your printer.
Understanding how Elements uses color profiles
When using the Print dialog box (or the More Options section of the Print 
dialog box), you can manage color in Photoshop Elements in one of three 
ways when it comes time to print your files:
	
✓	Printer Manages Colors: This method permits your printer to decide 
which profile is used when your photo is printed to your desktop color 
printer. Your printer makes this decision according to the paper you 
select as the source paper used to print your photos. If you choose 
Epson Premium Glossy Photo Paper, for example, your printer chooses 
the profile that goes along with that particular paper. If you choose 
another paper, your printer chooses a different color profile. This 
method is all automatic, and color profile selection is made when you 
print your file.
	
✓	Photoshop Elements Manages Color: When you make this choice, color 
management is taken away from your printer and is controlled by 
Elements. You must choose a color profile after making this choice in 
the Print dialog box. Desktop printers that fall in the medium-to-more-
expensive range often have many color profiles they can install.
	
✓	No Color Management: You use this choice if you have a color profile 
embedded in one of your pictures. You’ll probably rarely use this 
option. Unless you know how to embed profiles or receive files with 
embedded profiles from other users, don’t make this choice in the Print 
dialog box.
Each of these three options requires you to make some kind of choice about 
how color is managed. You make choices (as we discuss later in this chap­
ter, when we walk you through the steps for printing) about whether to 
color-manage your output. These selections are all unique to the Print dialog 
box for your individual printer.
Printing to Inkjet Printers
Printers are installed on your computer with printer drivers that are 
designed to offer you settings and controls for options unique to your 
printer. We can’t hope to cover all printers and the variations you find with 
each device.

581
Book IX 
Chapter 2
Getting It Printed
Printing to Inkjet Printers
What we can do is give you some general idea for printing by showing how 
it’s done with Epson printers — one of the more-popular desktop printer 
makes out there. This gives you a basis for understanding some of the set­
tings you need to adjust when printing color to desktop printers and submit­
ting photos to some service providers.
	
If you own a different brand of printer or use a service that uses other print­
ers, what’s important to remember in reviewing this section is the process 
involved in printing your files. Regardless of what type of printer you own, 
be aware of when a color profile is used and how color is either managed or 
not managed. You may have different check box selections and menu com­
mands, but the process is the same for any printer printing your photos.
Over the past few years, at least half of the many service-provider trouble­
shooting tech calls coming from clients involved problems with accurate 
color output from Epson and some other ink jet printers. We’re not talking 
about subtle changes between monitor and printer, but huge, monstrous 
color changes on output prints. As it turns out, almost all the strange output 
results originated from just one minor error that occurred when the file was 
set up to print — it involved when and how to manage color in the Print dia­
log box.
	
Color profiles are also dependent upon the ink being used. Refilling car­
tridges with generic ink can (in some cases) result in colors being shifted. 
Similarly, if the nozzles aren’t clean and delivering ink consistently, you can 
get some very strange results.
We’ve come up with settings that will work well for you to get accurate 
results without stress or frustration. Just remember to use the settings 
exactly as described, and you can achieve superior results with either desk­
top or professional printers.
When you install your printer driver, the installation utility also installs a 
number of color profiles. You can choose the profiles in the Photoshop 
Elements Print dialog box and control all the printing by using the profile 
provided by your printer manufacturer.
	
You can also print from the Organizer by selecting one or more image 
thumbnails in the Organizer window and then choosing File➪Print. We use 
printing from Edit Full mode for the examples shown here because you may 
often want to perform some final corrections before printing.
You have a choice for how these profiles are used. You can
	
✓	Choose to let your printer manage color: The profiling selection is auto­
matic, and you don’t have to worry about making other choices in the 
Print dialog boxes.

582
Printing to Inkjet Printers
	
✓	Choose to let Photoshop Elements manage color: In this case, you need 
to make some choices about the color profile to be used and make 
choices for the color-management process.
	
We’re talking about two very different issues here. One issue is color man­
agement, which ultimately comes down to whether Elements manages your 
color, your printer manages color, or whether you use no color management 
at all. The other issue is choosing a color profile. Therefore, you have a 
series of combined options to choose from. You can choose a profile and 
either turn color management on or off, or you can elect not to make a pro­
file choice and decide whether color management is on or off. The choices 
you make are critical to getting color right on your output.
All the methods are described in the following sections.
Automatic profile selection for Epson printers
The automatic profile selection method exists, and depending on what 
model of printer you have, you may be required to make this choice.
Your options all depend on whether the printer you buy installs color pro­
files on your computer. If you buy some low-end color printers that cost less 
than $100, the installer software typically doesn’t install color profiles. When 
no profiles are installed, the printer manages the color through built-in pro­
files contained in the printer’s memory.
High-end models (above the $100 price range) often install individual color 
profiles. You might see the profiles for various papers in the Printer Profile 
pop-up menu in the Elements More Options dialog box. If you have one of 
these high-end printers, you might want to choose the profile that matches 
the paper you’re using and let Elements manage the color.
As we discuss in Book III, Chapter 4, you have two choices for your color 
workspace. Those choices are sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998). The workspace is 
used to see color on your monitor. We also talk (in Book III, Chapter 4) about 
calibrating your monitor so the colors you see appear as close to real-world 
color as you can get.
When you print a picture, the color from your workspace (either sRGB or 
Adobe RGB [1998]) is converted to your printer color. So, you want to fit all 
the color you see in an sRGB workspace, for example, into the printer’s pro­
file so that the print looks as close as possible to what you see on your moni­
tor. Elements takes care of this color conversion. The only thing you need to 
worry about is making the right choice for how that conversion takes place.

	 The file doesn’t print yet. First, the Windows system Print dialog box 
opens. Click Preferences, and the Printing Preferences dialog box opens, 
as shown in Figure 2-9.
Figure 2-9: Click Preferences in the first dialog box that opens, 
and the selected printer preferences opens.
	
	 On the Macintosh, the OS X System Print dialog box opens. You need to 
make two choices here:
	
•	 Open the pop-up menu below the Pages item and choose Print 
Settings, as shown in Figure 2-10. From the Media Type pop-up menu, 
choose the paper for your output.
	
•	 The second choice Macintosh users need to make is the selection for

	 Here are the most important choices:
	
•	 Select a paper type. You selected paper already? The second drop-
down list in the Paper & Quality Options section of the dialog box 
determines the application of inks. Choose the same paper here as 
you did in Step 8.
	
•	 Turn on color management. Because you’re letting the printer driver 
determine the color, you need to be certain that the Color Controls 
radio button is active. This setting tells the printer driver to automat­
ically select a printer profile for the paper type you selected.
	
•	 Set the color mode. Don’t use Epson Vivid. This choice produces infe­
rior results on photos. Choose Best Photo, the Epson Standard, or 
Adobe RGB, depending on your printer.
	
	
If you frequently print files using the same settings, you can save your 
settings by clicking the Save Setting button.

10.	 To print the photo, click OK, and then OK again in the Print dialog 
box.
	
	 Your file is sent to your printer. The color is converted automatically 
from your source workspace of sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998) to the profile 
the printer driver automatically selects for you.
Selecting a printer profile
Another method for managing color when you’re printing files is to select a 
printer profile from the available list of color profiles installed with your 
printer. Whereas in the preceding section, you used your printer to manage 
color, this time you let Photoshop Elements manage the color.
The steps in this section are the same as the ones described in the preced­
ing section for printing files for automatic profile selection when you’re set­
ting up the page and selecting a printer. When you choose File➪Print, you 
open the Elements Print dialog box. To let Elements handle the color conver­
sion, follow these steps in the Print dialog box:
	
1.	 From the Printer Profile drop-down list in the Color Management sec­
tion of the Print dialog box, select the color profile designed for use 
with the paper you’ve chosen.
	
	 In this example, we use a heavy­
weight-matte-paper color profile, 
as shown in Figure 2-13. (Note that 
custom color profiles you acquire 
from a profiling service come with 
recommended color-rendering 
intents. For this paper, Relative 
Colorimetric is recommended and 
is chosen on the Rendering Intent 
drop-down list, as shown in Fig-
ure 2-13.)
	
2.	 Click Print.
	
	 The second Print dialog box opens.
	
3.	 Click the Properties button.
	
	 You arrive at the same dialog box shown in Figure 2-9. On the 
Macintosh, you arrive at the same dialog box shown in Figure 2-10.
	
4.	 In Windows, click the Best Photo radio button and from the Type 
drop-down list, select the recommended paper choice. On the 
Macintosh, make your paper choice, as shown in Figure 2-10.
Figure 2-13: Choose a printer profile that 
matches the paper you use.

588
Printing to Inkjet Printers
	
	 Custom color profiles are also shipped with guidelines for selecting 
proper paper.
	
5.	 In Windows, click Advanced and then click Continue to arrive at the 
dialog box shown in Figure 2-14. On the Macintosh, choose Color 
Management from the pop-up menu to arrive at the same dialog box 
shown in Figure 2-11.
	
	 The paper choice selection is automatically carried over from the previ­
ous Properties dialog box (see Step 2 in the preceding section). The one 
setting you change is in the Color Management section.
	
6.	 In Windows, click the ICM (Image Color Management) radio button 
and select the Off (No Color Adjustment) check box, as shown in 
Figure 2-14. On the Macintosh, click the Off (No Color Adjustment) 
radio button.
Figure 2-14: Click ICM and check Off (No Color Adjustment).
	
	 Because you selected the color profile in Step 1 and you’re letting 
Elements manage the color, be sure the Color Management feature is 
turned off. If you don’t turn off Color Management, you end up double-
profiling your print.

589

Using Online Printing Services (Windows)
	
The choice to manage color or not to manage it is simplified in Photoshop 
Elements. In the Color Management area of the dialog box, a message is 
reported each time you make a selection from the Color Handling drop-down 
list. Right below Source Space, you see a message asking if you remembered 
to turn Color Management on or off. Each time you make a selection for the 
Color Handling, pause a moment and read the message. This is your 
reminder that you need to follow the recommendation to properly handle 
color.
Using Online Printing Services (Windows)
Photoshop Elements supports the Adobe Photoshop Services program, 
which is a joint effort between Adobe Systems and Kodak EasyShare (for­
merly Ofoto), a division of Kodak. The Services program offers online order­
ing of prints and sharing of photos and projects, and it has a huge array of 
different print products for consumers and professionals.
As of this writing, you get ten free prints, so it’s worth taking a little time to 
check out the service — especially if you want to order prints and have them 
mailed directly to your home or office. No lines, no hassles, no dealing with 
high gasoline costs — this service offers great prints and an abundance of 
convenience.
To use the service, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select files in the Organizer much as you’d select files for printing.
	
2.	 In either editing mode or the Organizer, choose File➪Order Prints.
	
	 Alternatively, you can click the Share tab in the Panel Bin and then click 
the Order Prints button.
	
	 The Kodak EasyShare Wizard opens, as shown in Figure 2-15. The first 
screen shown in the wizard is a form for you to create an account.
	
	 If you try to place an order from your office where the IT department 
prevents you from connecting to some external sources, you may need 
to have your firewall settings adjusted. Talk to someone in your IT 
department to help you make a connection.
	
3.	 If you haven’t set up an account already, fill in the information and 
step through the wizard by clicking the Next button on each page. If 
you have set up an account, supply your logon information.
	
	 The selected files in the Organizer are automatically loaded in Step 1 of 
the wizard’s order page.

590
Exploring Other Print Options
Figure 2-15: Choose File➪Order Prints to open the Kodak EasyShare Wizard.
	
4.	 Modify your order by deleting files from the order and specifying dif­
ferent print sizes and quantities.
	
	 One nice feature in the service is the option to send duplicate prints to 
another party. You can keep an address book on the provider’s Web site 
and specify whom you want to receive an order. This feature is helpful if 
you’re away spending your children’s inheritance on a Caribbean cruise 
and want to send photos of the great time you’re having to all your kids. 
Just pop open your laptop on the pool deck, load the digital camera 
images, and connect via a wireless connection. Before you return to 
Buffalo in midwinter with a suntan, your kids will frown as they fan 
through the prints they received a week earlier.
	
5.	 Continue stepping through the wizard to upload your files and con­
firm your order, and then click the Finish button on the last pane.
	
	 Your order is complete.
Exploring Other Print Options
Photoshop Elements provides you with other options for printing things, 
such as video images and contact sheets; adding borders and trim lines; and 
inverting images for heat transfers, such as the ones you may use for iron-on 
T-shirt designs. You can find these options in the Print dialog box. Most of 
these print options are intuitive and easy to use. Just poke around, experi­
ment, and have fun. When it comes time to print, follow the recommenda­
tions we offer here for getting your color right.

✓	Optimizing type for screen viewing
✓	Optimizing images for Web hosting
W
hen we talk about optimizing images for Web viewing, we’re also 
talking about viewing files on computer monitors, TVs, iPods, and 
other screen devices. After all, viewing Web pages at this time in technology 
history requires viewing Web pages on a screen of some kind. This chapter 
presents concepts related to preparing and viewing files on the Web, as well 
as sharing files for viewing onscreen devices.
There are a few variances between Web-viewing photos and screen-viewing 
photos. It is important to use a color palette that can display the same col­
ors on Web-page images whatever the viewer’s computer operating system.
In this chapter, we talk about preparing images for Web hosting and 
screen viewing, working with color palettes optimized for Web-
hosted images, preparing type for Web and screen viewing, 
and creating Web galleries to upload your files to a Web 
service.
Understanding Basic 
Web Optimization
If you’ve read through chapters in any of the previ­
ous minibooks, you’re aware of some of the differ­
ences between files you prepare for print and those 
that are used for Web pages.
To optimize images for Web viewing, you want to reduce 
the file size for every image uploaded to a URL. If you download 
files from your camera or card reader (as we explain in Book II, 
Chapter 1) or prepare files for print (as we explain in Book IX, Chapter 2), 
you must often reduce the file sizes for Web-hosted images in order to 
ensure faster downloads.

592
Understanding Basic Web Optimization
Anyone viewing a Web page is likely to get impatient if file sizes are large and 
the download times are extraordinary. Getting files to the smallest file size 
without compromising image quality is the goal of every Web designer.
Choosing a resolution
Your first effort at optimizing files for Web hosting involves obtaining the 
best resolutions for Web-hosted files.
On the Macintosh, Web-hosted files are optimum at 72 ppi (pixels per inch); 
on Windows, resolutions of 72 and 96 ppi are optimum for Web hosting.
Before moving on to other optimizing tasks, it’s best to downsample images 
to either 72 or 96 ppi. As a standard, you can set the resolution to 72 ppi, 
confident that all Web browsers will display the images at the same size.
To downsample an image, do the following:
	
1.	 Open an image in Edit Full mode.
	
2.	 Choose Image➪Resize➪Image 
Size, or press Alt+Ctrl+I 
(Windows) or Option+Ô+I (Mac).
	
	 The Image Size dialog box opens, 
as shown in Figure 3-1.
	
3.	 Set the dimensions.
	
	 Type the new dimensions in either 
the Width or Height text box for 
the document size. By default, the 
proportions are constrained so 
when you type a value in either 
text box, the other size is supplied 
automatically by Elements.
	
4.	 Check the Resample Image check 
box and choose a resampling 
method from the drop-down list.
	
	 By default, the resampling method used is Bicubic, which provides the 
best results for continuous-tone images such as photos. You have other 
options in the drop-down list that work better with illustrated art, line 
art, and other types of images. For more information on the downsam­
pling methods, see Book III, Chapter 1.
Figure 3-1: The Image Size dialog box.

Web
Understanding Basic Web Optimization
	
5.	 Enter the desired resolution in the Resolution field.
	
6.	 Click OK.
	
	 The file is downsampled according to the settings made in the Image 
Size dialog box.
Upsampling images
As a general rule, avoid upsampling images — sizing up an image with the 
Resample Image check box enabled in the Image Size dialog box. We cover 
some of the pitfalls for upsampling images in Book III, Chapter 1. We also 
point you to a third-party plug-in that can be useful if you absolutely have to 
upsize images.
Rasterizing files
Rasterizing files is the process of converting vector artwork to raster art­
work. Artwork created in programs like Adobe Illustrator and CorelDraw are 
typically vector art files. Vector objects in Elements can be type as well as 
some shapes that are created on vector layers.
When you flatten layers in Elements you rasterize the vector layers. When 
you open vector art, such as Adobe Illustrator files, CorelDraw files, or PDF 
files, you rasterize the artwork. To read more about raster versus vector art, 
see Book III, Chapter 1. To read more about type on layers, see Book V, 
Chapter 3.
Rasterizing vector artwork on layers in Elements converts the artwork to 
pixels at the resolution of the open file where the vector artwork is added. 
When you open a file containing vector art, you can choose to rasterize the 
artwork at a user-defined resolution.
Choosing File➪Open
When you open artwork containing vector art, you see a dialog box where 
you control the options for rasterizing the file. In Figure 3-2, we opened a 
PDF document. The Import PDF dialog provides some controls for determin­
ing the size and resolution.
Unlike raster art, upsizing a vector art file doesn’t degrade the image. 
Because the artwork is not yet pixels, you can rasterize a vector file to any 
size you like. When preparing these images, you want both the physical 
dimensions and the resolution to be the best for your Web pages.

594
Understanding Basic Web Optimization
Figure 3-2: The Import PDF dialog box.
Selecting a color mode
In Book III, Chapter 2, we cover all the color modes supported by Elements. 
When you create images for Web pages, all the color modes available in 
Elements are acceptable for Web graphics. Your choices for color modes 
include
	
✓	Bitmap: The bitmap color mode is generally used for line art. Images, 
such as black-and-white logos, might be scanned as line art and, there­
fore, be rendered as bitmap images. After you have a bitmap image in 
Elements, you can save the files as GIF or PNG, but you don’t have an 
option for using the Save for Web command. It’s generally best to con­
vert bitmap images to grayscale first and then save the files for the Web.
	
✓	Grayscale: Grayscale images can be saved for Web hosting.
	
✓	Indexed Color: Indexed color images provide some options for reducing 
the number of colors in a file to get smaller file sizes. Continuous-tone 
images, such as photographs, generally won’t look as good onscreen 
unless they’re saved as RGB color images. However, artwork, such as 
color logos, can be reduced in file size by limiting the number of colors 
to fewer than 256 without degrading image quality.
	
✓	RGB color: RGB is best used with continuous-tone images.

595
Book IX 
Chapter 3
Getting It on the 
Web
Understanding Basic Web Optimization
Understanding file formats
Elements has a number of different file formats for saving files. However, 
only a few of the long list of supported file formats work with Web graphics. 
We cover all the formats in Book III, Chapter 2. For a little review, here are 
the formats you can use when preparing files for Web hosting.
GIF
GIF is one of the popular file formats 
you find on many Web sites. GIF files 
are saved as indexed color where the 
total number of colors in an image can 
be reduced to fewer than 256 in order 
to get smaller file sizes. You can also 
use the GIF format when saving images 
that display animated effects.
When you choose File➪Save As in Edit 
Full mode and choose CompuServe GIF 
(*.GIF), the Indexed Color palette box 
opens, as shown in Figure 3-3. In this 
dialog box, you make choices for
	
✓	Palette: Open the Palette drop-
down list and you can choose from 
a number of different color-palette 
options. Among your choices is the Web palette. Making this choice 
reduces the total colors from the default 256 to 217. The 217 colors are 
known as Web Safe colors, meaning that these colors look the same on 
both the Macintosh and Windows operating systems.
	
✓	Colors: You can reduce colors lower than the default 256 by typing a 
number in the Colors text box. The more colors you eliminate, the lower 
the file size. However, if you reduce colors in continuous-tone images, 
you notice severe contrast between tones. This contrast is likely to pro­
duce degraded images. Furthermore, reducing colors in artwork too far 
may produce other unwanted results. You need to experiment a little 
when reducing colors by checking the Preview check box and viewing 
the image before actually saving. What you see on your screen is what 
you get. If the preview looks good, go ahead and click OK.
	
✓	Forced: This option is available with bitmap images. You can save as 
Black and White, and when the Transparency check box is enabled, the 
whites appear as transparent.
	
✓	Matte: When you have transparency in an image, you can use a matte 
color for the transparent areas. Your choices include a list of preset col­
ors as well as a Custom option for you to set the color to a custom color 
within the palette you choose.
Figure 3-3: The Indexed Color palette box 
opens when you save files as CompuServe 
GIF.

596
Understanding Basic Web Optimization
	
✓	Dither: When indexed files are saved and the colors contain up to a max­
imum of 256 colors, you need a way to simulate color transitions. This is 
handled through a dithering process whereby the color transitions sim­
ulate a view that appears to have more than 256 colors. Your dither 
choices include Diffusion, Pattern, and Noise. For continuous tone 
images, the Diffusion dither produces the least-obvious color 
transitions.
	
✓	Preserve Exact Colors: Check this box to preserve colors that have 
exact matches to the color palette you choose.
JPEG
JPEG is also one of the most popular 
file formats you find on Web pages. 
JPEG images can be saved as progres­
sive JPEGs to permit the image file to 
be downloaded progressively (in stages, 
in other words), This format supports 
some great file compression. When you 
save as JPEG, the JPEG Options dialog 
box opens, as shown in Figure 3-4. 
Your options in this dialog box include
	
✓	Matte: This option is the same as 
when saving as GIF.
	
✓	Quality: Type a value between 1 
and 12 for the amount of compres­
sion you want to apply to the 
saved file. JPEG is a lossy file format, meaning that data are thrown away 
during compression. The lower the number, the more data are thrown 
away. If you reduce the value too low, you see obvious image degrada­
tion. Keep the Preview check box checked, and you can dynamically see 
the results your tweaking has on the image before clicking OK.
	
	The drop-down list adjacent to the Quality value offers you five settings. 
When making a menu choice, the Quality value changes respective to 
the menu choice. Additionally, you can move the slider to change the 
value in the Quality text box.
	
	
When previewing different compression options, be sure to zoom in on 
your photos. If the photo is fit in the Image window, you may not see the 
results of the compression selections you make when the Preview check 
box is checked. If you start with the image fit within the Image window, 
you can keep the JPEG Options dialog box open and press Ctrl++ (Ô++ 
on a Mac) to zoom in. You can place the cursor in the Image window, 
and you see the Hand tool. Click and drag the photo around to view 
areas respective to the Quality setting you choose in the JPEG Options 
dialog box.

Using a Web-Safe Palette and Hexadecimal Colors
	
✓	Format Options: You have three choices. The first two use line-by-line 
passing and an optimized encoding system to display images. The 
Progressive option displays images using several passes. You specify 
the number of passes in the Scans drop-down list, where you can choose 
from 3 and 5.
PNG
PNG supports two different formats — PNG-8 and 
PNG-24. You can save files as PNG-8 using the Save 
As dialog box. However, using the Save As com­
mand doesn’t provide you all the options that can 
be set for PNG files. (In fact, all you get from the 
Save As dialog box are the rather paltry options 
shown in Figure 3-5.) If you want to use the PNG-24 
format or take advantage of more option choices 
for PNG-8, you must use the Save for Web dialog 
box. See “Optimizing Images with Save for Web” 
later in this chapter.
Using a Web-Safe Palette and Hexadecimal Colors
When working with indexed color files, you have a maximum of 256 colors 
available in the Indexed Color palette. Compare that value with the 16.7 mil­
lion colors that you have available with RGB color.
When you convert an RGB image to indexed color, the colors outside the 
Indexed Color spectrum are dithered to simulate colors that more closely 
resemble an image in RGB mode.
Out of the 256 colors that you find in the Indexed Color palette, 39 colors do 
not look the same in different operating systems. The color display is deter­
mined by the operating system (OS) for the Macintosh and Windows com­
puters, and it turns out that these operating systems produce 39 different 
color values that can’t be viewed identically across platforms. Therefore, 
you have 217 out of 256 colors that are viewed identically by both operating 
systems.
Specifying a foreground Web Safe color
The 217 colors are referred to as being within a Web Safe color palette, and 
Elements makes it easy for you to work with the palette when converting 
color images, creating type, and creating graphic elements, such as buttons 
and icons.

dialog box when using Save 
As and choosing the PNG 
format.

Using a Web-Safe Palette and Hexadecimal Colors
To specify a color within the Web Safe color palette, do the following:
	
1.	 Open Edit Full mode.
	
2.	 Click the Foreground color swatch in the Tools panel.
	
	 The Color Picker (Foreground Color) dialog box opens.
	
3.	 Click Only Web Colors.
	
	 Only the colors within a Web Safe color palette are displayed in the dia­
log box.
	
4.	 Click in the large color swatch to make a color selection.
	
	 You can scroll the hues by moving the slider to the right of the large 
color swatch. When you enter the hue range of a color you want, click in 
the swatch, as shown in Figure 3-6.
Figure 3-6: Check Only Web Colors to display the Web Safe color palette.
	
	
The color choice you make in the Foreground Color dialog box reports 
the hexadecimal value of the color. In Figure 3-6, the value is ff0033. You 
can use this value in HTML code when creating Web pages to specify 
background color and color for other Web page elements.
	
5.	 Click OK.
	
	 The Web Safe color you selected is loaded in the Foreground color 
swatch in the Tools panel. When you fill selections and use the painting 
and marking tools, the color you apply is a Web Safe color. For more 
information on filling selections and painting, see Book IV, Chapter 1.

Using a Web Safe palette
If you create various elements and 
objects that you want to include in a 
Web page design, you want to open a 
palette and work with Web Safe colors. 
To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open Edit Full mode.
	
2.	 Open the Color Swatches palette.
	
	 Choose Window➪Color Swatches.
	
3.	 Load a Web Safe palette.
	
	 Open the drop-down list in the 
Color Swatches palette and choose 
from Web Hues, Web Safe Colors, 
or Web Spectrum, as shown in 
Figure 3-7. The colors you work 
with from any of these color swatch libraries are within the Web Safe 
color spectrum.
Making Type Look Good Onscreen
Adding type to images or creating type on a blank, new file (for example, one 
that creates a banner on a Web page) is something that you do frequently in 
Elements if you’re a Web page designer.
You need to take few precautions when creating type for the Web. These 
include
	
✓	Setting the file size and resolution before creating the type.
	
	Don’t rely on resampling images when you have type as either a stand­
alone element or an addition to photos and layouts.
	
✓	Using Web Safe colors.
	
	Set the foreground color from the Web Safe color palette, or choose a 
color from the Color Swatches library of Web Safe colors.
	
✓	Being certain to use anti-aliased type.
	
	When you create type, be certain the Anti-alias icon is enabled in the 
Options bar, as shown in Figure 3-8.
Figure 3-7: Choose a Web Safe color 
palette from the drop-down list.

600
Making Type Look Good Onscreen
Figure 3-8: When creating type, click the Anti-alias icon in the Options bar.
When you anti-alias type, Elements creates some pixels of different color val­
ues at the edges of your type to simulate a smoother type appearance. If you 
don’t anti-alias the type, the edges appear jagged. In Figure 3-9, you see type 
created on the left without anti-aliasing. On the right, you see the same type 
created with anti-aliasing.
Figure 3-9: Type created without anti-aliasing (left) and with anti-aliasing (right).
We cover a lot more related to working with type in Book V, Chapter 3. Look 
over that chapter to understand much more about specifying type.

Optimizing Images with Save for Web
Optimizing Images with Save for Web
The save options you have available in the Save As dialog box enable you to 
save files in formats that are compatible with Web-hosted images. However, 
the options you have in the Save As dialog box are much more limited than 
the ones available to you in the Save for Web dialog box.
In the Save for Web dialog box, you can optimize images and create previews 
to simulate download times. Even if you don’t tweak the sampling and/or 
resolution of your files, you can rely on the Save for Web dialog box to offer 
you many other optimization features.
Choose File➪Save for Web to open the Save for Web dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 3-10. In this dialog box, you can choose any of the compatible file for­
mats that support Web-hosting images. Additionally, you can adjust settings 
and optimize your files to create the smallest file sizes.
Figure 3-10: The Save for Web dialog box.
The option choices you have in the Save for Web dialog box are covered in 
Book III, Chapter 2. Look over that chapter to explore all the possible 
options.

Book IX: Creating and Sharing with Elements

Chapter 4: Sharing Projects 
with Others
In This Chapter
✓	Using the Share panel
✓	Creating online albums
✓	Attaching files to e-mail
✓	Using Photo Mail
✓	Using online sharing services
You shoot photos primarily for two reasons (if you’re not selling them 
for income). One reason is for personal satisfaction so you can revel in 
your own work. The other reason involves sharing your creations with 
others.
Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of photography is experiencing the 
appreciation of family and friends who laugh, cry, ooh, and aah when look­
ing at your images.
Photoshop Elements provides you with a number of different 
sharing options to get those laughs, cries, oohs, and aahs 
from others. When it comes down to it, the sharing of 
photos just might be one of the best reasons you have 
for using Photoshop Elements.
In this chapter, we look at the number of different 
opportunities Elements provides to enable you to 
share photos in your living room or across the 
world.
Getting a Grip on the Share Panel
When you open Edit Full mode (Windows) and click the 
Share button, the options for sharing photos appear listed in 
the Share panel, as shown in Figure 4-1. On the Macintosh, the 

604
Creating an Online Album (Windows)
common items you find in Edit Full 
mode include E-Mail Attachments, 
CD/DVD, and PDF Slide Show. The 
Macintosh also includes Web Photo 
Gallery.
On Windows, the Share panel in the 
Organizer has the same options found 
in Edit Full mode with the addition of 
Burn Video DVD/BluRay, Burn Data 
CD/DVD, Online Video Sharing, and 
Mobile Phones and Players. These 
four choices require installation of 
Adobe Premiere Elements.
To share photos, you either select 
the images you want to share in the 
Organizer (Windows) or load up pho­
tos in the Project Bin in Edit Full mode 
(Windows or Macintosh). Then click 
one of the buttons in the panel or open 
the More Options menu and choose 
one of the menu items.
Creating an Online Album 
(Windows)
The first of the sharing options we cover in this chapter involves creating an 
online album for Windows users. Elements offers a few options for sharing 
photo albums online. The name of this option is a bit misleading because 
you don’t necessarily have to host your album online in order to share it. In 
fact, you have several separate options for sharing photo albums, including
	
✓	Photoshop Showcase: An album is prepared for uploading to Photoshop 
Services where people you invite can see your albums online.
	
✓	Export to CD/DVD: This option gives you the opportunity to save your 
creation to a CD or DVD.
	
✓	Export to FTP: You can host an album on Photoshop.com as a Web 
page. All the HTML code is included in your upload, so you don’t need to 
worry about how images are viewed or how to create URL links. Note 
that this sharing option no longer lets you host pages on a Web server 
space from your local Internet service provider (ISP). To upload files to 
your own Web site, you need to use an ftp client and upload files much 
like you upload your own Web pages.

mode on Windows.

Creating an Online Album (Windows)
	
✓	Export to Hard Disk: This option permits you to create a photo album 
and save it to your hard disk. You can later upload the album to an 
online service.
Elements makes it easy for you to create an online album. To verify our 
claim, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer and select the photos you want to use in a new 
album.
	
2.	 Click Share in the Panel Bin and choose Online Album from the panel 
options (refer to Figure 4-1).
	
3.	 Select the item to Share To and 
then choose one of the options 
listed earlier in this section.
	
4.	 Create a new album to share 
online.
	
	 Click the Create New Album radio 
button in the Share panel and leave 
the default Photoshop Showcase 
radio button active. Click Next to 
proceed to the next panel.
	
	 The next pane shows two tabs — 
one for the content and the other 
for sharing options. The default tab 
in view is the Content panel, as 
shown in Figure 4-2.
	
5.	 At the top of the panel, choose a 
category from the Album 
Category drop-down list and type 
a name for your album.
	
	 You can’t proceed to share your 
album until you type a name for 
the album.
	
6.	 (Optional) Add or remove photos 
from the album.
	
	 If you find that you don’t want 
some of the photos shown in the 
Content panel, click the unwanted 
photos and then click the minus 
(–) icon. If you want to add addi­
tional photos, drag them from the 
Organizer to the Content panel or 
click a photo in the Organizer and 
then click the Add (+) icon.
Figure 4-2: Order your photos in the 
Content panel.

606
Creating an E-Mail Attachment
	
7.	 Change the order of the photos in the album.
	
	 The order shown in the panel is the same order the photos will appear 
in your album. If you want to rearrange the photos, click and drag them 
around the Content panel. The panel behaves much like a slide sorter.
	
8.	 Click the Sharing tab in the Share panel.
	
	 Elements builds a preview of your album.
	
9.	 Choose a template.
	
	 At the top of the preview shown in Figure 4-3, you find several options 
for choosing a template. Click one of the preview thumbnails to change 
the template for the album. You have a number of category choices from 
the Select a Template drop-down list. Go ahead and click different tem­
plate options and Elements updates the preview.
Figure 4-3: Click the Sharing tab and choose a template for your album.
	
10.	 After choosing the template you want, click Done.
	
	 Your album is uploaded to Photoshop Showcase.
Creating an E-Mail Attachment
Elements makes it easy for you to attach photos to an e-mail message. You 
can stay in the Organizer (Windows) or Adobe Bridge (Macintosh). You 
don’t have to open your e-mail client and search your hard drive to locate 
the photos you want to attach to an e-mail message.

607
Book IX 
Chapter 4

Creating an E-Mail Attachment
To attach photos to a message, do the following:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer (Windows) or 
Adobe Bridge (Macintosh).
	
2.	 Select photos you want to e-mail.
	
3.	 In Windows, open the Share 
panel in the Panel Bin and click 
E-Mail Attachments. On the 
Macintosh, choose File➪Attach 
to Email at which point Bridge 
switches you to Edit Full mode 
and the editor launches your 
e-mail client.
	
	 The photos you select in the 
Organizer appear in the E-Mail 
Attachments panel, as shown in 
Figure 4-4.
	
4.	 Choose a photo size from the 
Maximum Photo Size drop-down 
list and adjust the quality slider.
	
	 Notice the readout below the slider 
informs you of the size of the 
image and the amount of time nec­
essary to send the file at 56Kbps.
	
5.	 Click Next. 
	
	 Scroll to the bottom of the panel to 
locate the Next button.
	
	 The next pane in the E-Mail 
Attachments panel opens where you can type a message.
	
6.	 Add a message to the Message text box.
	
7.	 Add contacts.
	
	 If you don’t find a list of recipients, you don’t have any in your Elements 
address book. To add recipients:
	
a.	 Click the Edit Recipients in Address Book icon in the top-right corner of 
the Select Recipients area of the E-Mail Attachments panel.
	
	 You add new contacts to the Contact Book dialog box that opens.
	
b.	 Add contacts and click OK.
	
c.	 When you return to the E-Mail Attachments panel, check the boxes adja­
cent to the names of the contacts you want to receive your e-mail.
Figure 4-4: Choose a size for the file 
attachment.

608
Sending Photo Mail (Windows)
	
8.	 Click Next.
	
	 Your default e-mail client opens with the files you selected appearing as 
attachments and a default message.
	
9.	 (Optional) Feel free to edit the message if you like.
	
10.	 Click Send.
	
	 Your e-mail, with photo attachments, is sent on its way.
Sending Photo Mail (Windows)
Although similar to sending e-mail attachments, using Photo Mail lets you 
package your photo attachments in a neat layout you create in Elements. 
You select photos in the Organizer, assemble them in a design, and then 
send them off via e-mail.
To use Photo Mail, do the following:
	
1.	 Open the Organizer.
	
2.	 Select photos you want to use with Photo Mail.
	
3.	 Open the Share panel in the Panel Bin and click Photo Mail (refer to 
Figure 4-1).
	
	 Photos you select in the Organizer appear in the Photo Mail panel, 
which is similar to the same panel used with E-Mail Attachments (refer 
to Figure 4-4).
	
4.	 Click Next.
	
	 The next pane opens in the Photo Mail panel, again similar to the E-Mail 
Attachments panel.
	
5.	 Type a message and add recipients.
	
	 The options for adding recipients and the message in Photo Mail are the 
same as you have when sending e-mail attachments (see the preceding 
section for details).
	
6.	 Click Next.
	
	 The Stationery & Layouts Wizard opens, as shown in Figure 4-5.
	
7.	 Choose a layout design.
	
	 In the left pane, you find a list of categories representing different lay­
outs. Click a category to expand it, and click one of the items nested 
below the category name.
	
8.	 Click Next Step to open the Layout panel.

Figure 4-5: The Stationery and Layouts Wizard.
	
9.	 Adjust the layout to your liking.
	
	 The Layout panel provides options for sizing 
images, choosing from a list of layout designs, 
assigning text attributes, and adjusting bor­
ders and border colors, as shown in Figure 
4-6. Make choices for the design effect you 
want to use for your Photo Mail.
	
10.	 Click Next.
	
	 Elements creates the design and adds it as a 
file attachment in a new e-mail message in 
your default e-mail client.
	
11.	 Click Send to e-mail the layout to the recipi­
ents you identified in Step 5.
Sharing Photos Online
Several methods of sharing your creations are 
available in Elements via third-party services. 
Additional options are available in the Share panel 
when you click the More Options button (refer to 
Figure 4-1). Here you find several supported ser­
vices for displaying and sharing photos.
