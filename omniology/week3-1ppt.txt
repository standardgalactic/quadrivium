Nervous System Organization 

Somatic motor programs serve essential needs 
(i.e., locomotion, posture, breathing) and range 
from involuntary actions (withdrawal reflexes) to 
complex voluntary activities.

A MOTOR UNIT consists of a motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers it controls.  
Motor Unit 
one neuron can control from 3-1000 fibers, all will be in the 
 
same muscle, usually spread out 
 
a muscle fiber is usually innervated by a single neuron

Somatic nervous system controls locomotion, fine movements, 
body posture, and equilibrium by acting on motor neurons in 
the spinal cord that innervate skeletal muscles.  
 
A motor neuron and the muscle fibers that it innervates 
constitute a motor unit.  
 
Motor neurons have cell bodies located in grey matter of the 
ventral horn of the spinal cord. The spinal cord contains 
interneurons which play a role in coordinating the responses 
of antagonistic and synergistic muscles to carry out intended 
movements as well as reflexive movements initiated by 
sensory receptors.
