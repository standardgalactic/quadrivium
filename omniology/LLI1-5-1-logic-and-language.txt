Noam Chomsky (1928– )
chomsky’s hypothesis (1957):
Natural languages can
be described as formal systems.

Richard Montague (1930–1970)
“There is in my opinion no important
theoretical diﬀerence between natural
language and the artiﬁcial language of
logicians; indeed I consider it possible to
comprehend the syntax and semantics of
both kinds of languages within a single
natural and mathematically precise
theory.”
— Richard Montague, “Universal Grammar” 1970

Barbara Partee (1940– )
▶Brought linguistics and
formal logic together.
▶Developed and
promoted Montague
semantics.
▶Helped establish
connetions between
formal syntax and formal
semantics.

Linguists are like vacuum cleaners. . .
“Linguists are like vacuum cleaners!
Philosophers are rather like black holes.
Philosophers react to every theory by
constructing arguments against it.
Linguists react to every theory by taking it
in and using it to explain some of their
millions of examples.”
The philosopher David Kaplan in conversation
with linguist Barbara Partee, quoted in Partee,
“Reﬂections of a formal semanticist as of Feb 2005”

I saw elephants in my underwear.
I gave her cat food.

I saw elephants (while I was) in my underwear.

I saw elephants (which were) in my underwear.

I gave (her cat) food or I gave her (cat food)?

Start with your own judgements about meaning
“Formalization is an excellent thing in
moderation. When there’s too little, claims
are fuzzy and argumentation is sloppy. But
there can be too much formalization, or
premature formalization. So one shouldn’t
hesitate to share ideas in an informal state;
looking at things from many points of view
may help a good formalization emerge.”
