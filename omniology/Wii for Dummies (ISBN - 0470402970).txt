About the Author
Kyle Orland has been playing video games pretty much nonstop since just 
before he got a Nintendo Entertainment System for his seventh birthday. At 
age 14, he started writing about those games professionally when he set up a 
fansite for Super Mario Bros. on the free Web space provided by his parents’ 
America Online account. Twelve years later, Super Mario Bros. HQ is still up 
and running at a more professional-looking home: www.smbhq.com.
From that humble beginning, Kyle has gone on to become a successful 
freelance journalist specializing in video games. He writes regular news posts 
and features for popular gaming weblog Joystiq.com, pens the weekly 
PressSpotting column for CNET’s Gamespot.com, co-hosts the Press Start 
gaming podcast on National Public Radio’s web site, and jots down daily, 
one-hour game reviews for Crispy Gamer’s Games for Lunch feature. Kyle’s 
work has also appeared in Electronic Gaming Monthly, Paste Magazine, 
Gamasutra, GameDaily, and The Escapist, among other outlets. He has been 
quoted as a gaming expert in The New York Times, The Washington Post, 
G4TV, and TheStreet.com, among other outlets.
This is Kyle’s second book. He co-wrote The Video Game Style Guide and 
Reference Manual with David Thomas and Scott Steinberg in 2007 (published 
by Lulu.com). His favorite game of all time is Super Mario 64.


Dedication
To my wife, Michelle, who never lets me think I can’t do anything I put my 
mind to.
To my parents, who bought me my first Nintendo Entertainment System and 
held their tongues when I threw away a nice, secure, decently paying desk 
job to follow my dream of becoming an underpaid game journalist.
To all the friends, family, and colleagues who wouldn’t let me go crazy while 
writing nearly 300 pages of reference material about a single game system.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks to Gateway for making a solid laptop that stood up to hours and 
hours of typing and editing for the making of this book. Thanks to Pinnacle 
for making the Dazzle, a device that made taking the screenshots for the 
in-book figures a painless process. Thanks to Sony for making a nice little 
camera that I used to take many pictures of their competitor’s system. 
Thanks to Nadeo for making TrackMania, a game that helped keep me sane 
during many a writing break.
Thanks to Nintendo for providing the hardware and much of the software 
used in the making of this book (not to mention the decades of gaming enjoy-
ment they’ve provided me through their products). Thanks to my editors at 
Wiley, including Amy Fandrei, Steven Hayes, Jean Nelson, and Barry Childs-
Helton, for making me look good. Thanks to Alexander Sliwinski for making 
sure you can actually do everything I say you can do in the book. Thanks to 
the team at Joystiq that helped me get this gig and understood when I went 
on a functional leave of absence for two months to actually write it.
Thanks to my sister, Paige, for not letting me distract myself from writing 
by talking to her on Instant Messenger. Thanks to my friend Mike for loaning 
me a Wii Remote Jacket to use in some figures. Last but not least, thanks 
to Michelle for forcing me to get out of the house occasionally during the 
whirlwind writing process.

Introduction
I
f you’re actually reading this Introduction, you’re probably a customer in 
a bookstore, trying to decide whether or not you should buy this book. 
To help you out, I’ve made up a simple quiz:
 
1. Do you own a Wii?
 
2. Do you intend to own a Wii soon?
If you answered yes to either question, then congratulations, you are one 
of the millions of people worldwide who should buy this book! If you 
answered “No,” please feel free to go out and buy a Wii and then retake the 
quiz (refer to Chapter 1 for some tips on how to find one). Thank you.
About This Book
Think of this book as the unabridged edition of those tiny user manuals 
that come with the Wii itself. While those manuals are all right for getting 
started, this book gives you much more detail on the inevitable issues that 
come up when using the Wii. From setting the Wii system up with your 
entertainment center to using the Wii’s many unique controllers; from 
connecting the system to the Internet to playing games, this book has the 
detailed instructions and troubleshooting you need to get it done.
This book isn’t meant to be read from front to back. Treat it more like a 
reference that you can consult whenever you find something confusing or 
difficult when using the Wii. The book is divided into chapters and sections 
by topic, so you can easily find what you’re looking for by perusing the table 
of contents. Failing that, please consult the index for the specific issue you 
need to know more about.
Conventions Used in This Book
I know that doing something the same way over and over again can be 
boring, but sometimes consistency can be a good thing. For one thing, it 
makes stuff easier to understand. In this book, those consistent elements are 
conventions. In fact, I use italics to identify and define the new terms.

Wii For Dummies 
Like all game systems, the Wii comes with a controller. The Wii Remote is 
the white, wireless, handheld controller that comes with the system and 
is the main means for interacting with the Wii. The book makes frequent 
mention of pressing buttons on this Remote. These buttons are clearly 
labeled on the Wii Remote itself, or you can consult Chapter 3 for more on 
the Remote’s button layout.
The Remote can also be used to control an on-screen pointer using infrared 
technology. Moving this pointer over an on-screen option and pressing the 
A button is referred to in the book as clicking. You may also have to hold 
down a button on the Remote and drag the pointer to another location on the 
screen at times. See Chapter 3 for more on using the Wii Remote as a pointer.
In general the Wii can run two types of programs, disc-based games, 
which are discussed in Part III, and Channels, which are discussed in Part 
II. Channels are simply applications that are stored on the Wii’s internal 
memory and don’t require a separate disc to run. See Chapter 5 for more on 
using the Wii Menu to access Channels and start disc-based games.
When I provide URLs (Web addresses) within a paragraph, they are in a 
monospace font and look like this: www.dummies.com.
What You Don’t Have to Read
While the bulk of this book is reference material that relates directly to 
getting the most out of your Wii, some sections simply provide supplemental 
information that some readers might find interesting. This extra information 
is placed in sidebars that are broken out in separate shaded boxes.
Any section labeled with the Technical Stuff icon (see the “Icons Used in 
This Book” section, farther along) is meant for advanced users, and won’t be 
necessary for the majority of Wii owners.
Foolish Assumptions
I’ve written this book with inexperienced Wii owners in mind — the new 
gamers who’ve never owned a video-game system before, or the lapsed 
gamers who last played games on their Atari 2600 or home Pong units. 
Those with more gaming experience will find shortcuts, tips, and tricks they 
may not have discovered on their own.

 Introduction
I’m assuming you have a basic familiarity with your television and your 
specific home-entertainment setup. If you don’t, you may want to consult 
the documentation for your home-entertainment equipment before you 
connect the Wii to your entertainment center (described in Chapter 2).
If you’re planning to hook your Wii up to the Internet, I assume you currently 
have a broadband Internet connection hooked up in your home and under-
stand the basic functionality of your high-speed modem and/or router. A 
complete tutorial on setting up a home Internet network is beyond the scope 
of this book — for help there, check out Home Networking For Dummies, 4th 
Edition, by Kathy Ivens (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
How This Book Is Organized
I divided this book into parts, organized by topic. Each part deals with one 
important aspect of the Wii experience. If you’re looking for information on a 
specific topic, check the headings in the table of contents, or skim the index.
By design, this book enables you to get as much (or as little) information as 
you need at any particular moment. For example, if you just need guidance 
setting up the system, refer to Chapter 3; if you’re just looking to use the 
Photo Channel, look up Chapter 8. By design, Wii For Dummies is a reference 
that you’ll reach for again and again whenever some new question about the 
Wii comes up.
Part I: The Basics
After some brief background about the history of Nintendo and the new Wii 
system, Part I tells you what to do with your new Wii after you get it from the 
store into your house. This includes information on hooking up the system 
to your TV or home entertainment setup, taking control of the system with 
the included and optional controllers, and connecting the system to your 
high-speed Internet connection.
Part II: The Channels
Video game systems aren’t just about games anymore, and the Wii is no 
exception. The Wii Menu lets you access other functions through built-in 
applications called Channels. These Channels open the Wii up to functions

Wii For Dummies 
that used to be limited to a computer, such as a full-featured Web browser 
and digital photo viewer. You can also use Channels to create and share 
cartoon-like digital avatars called Miis and download new games and 
Channels directly from the Wii Shop Channel. You also discover the News, 
Weather, and other miscellaneous Channels.
Part III: The Games
Despite the added functionality of the Channels, the Wii is still a game 
system, and so it’s meant to play video games. Part III details some basic 
information on how to pick games that are right for you and your family 
before diving in to a detailed description of two of the most popular games 
for the system: Wii Sports, which comes packaged with every Wii system, and 
Wii Fit, the revolutionary personal trainer in a box that uses your entire body 
as a controller. You can also find some recommendations of games to buy 
from your local gaming or electronics store.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
I’ve remained true to For Dummies style by including a Part of Tens. The 
chapters in this part can help you find ten games to download from the Wii 
Shop Channel, as well as ten optional Wii accessories that can help spice up 
your Wii experience.
Icons Used in This Book
To make your experience with the book easier, I use various icons in the 
margins of the book to indicate particular points of interest.
 
Whenever I give you a hint or a tip that makes an aspect of the Wii easier to 
use, I mark it with this little Tip thingamabob — it’s my way of sharing what 
I’ve figured out the hard way — so you don’t have to.
 
This icon is a friendly reminder or a marker for something that you want to 
make sure that you keep in mind. Usually this stuff is discussed elsewhere in 
the book, but who knows if you’ve read that part yet?
 
Ouch! This icon warns you about potential pitfalls or problems that you could 
run into, and gives advice on avoiding or fixing the issue. Be sure to read the 
whole paragraph before you even think of doing anything discussed next to 
this little guy.

 Introduction
 
The Wii is specifically designed not to require a lot of arcane, technical 
knowledge from its users, so this icon isn’t used too often in this book. When 
it is used, it means this portion discusses some advanced stuff that most 
users won’t need to worry themselves with. For the most part, if you don’t 
understand anything next to one of these icons, just ignore it.

f you’re like a lot of new Wii owners, you probably don’t know much about 
your new purchase or the story behind it. Sure, you may have heard a 
snippet on the local news about how the system was almost impossible to 
find after its initial release in late 2006. You even may have read a newspaper 
story about how the system is catching on with all sorts of unlikely groups of 
new gamers.
These factoids are just a part of the story behind the Wii. This chapter covers 
the hundred-plus year history of Nintendo leading up to the launch of the Wii 
and beyond.
Nintendo’s early years
Nintendo wasn’t always the electronic-enter-
tainment powerhouse it is today. The company 
was originally founded in 1889 as a producer of 
traditional handmade Japanese playing cards 
called hanafuda. The name “Nintendo” roughly 
translates to “Leave luck to heaven.” Company 
founder Fusajiro Yamauchi had plenty of luck 
when the Yakuza (the Japanese mafia) took a 
liking to Nintendo’s cards for their illegal gam-
bling halls. This interest helped the company 
expand to American-style playing cards by 1907, 
and build a wide-ranging distribution network of 
Japanese retailers by 1927. In 1947, Nintendo 
opened a three-story factory next door to the 
simple, one-room office that had once served 
as its headquarters.
By the 1950s, control of Nintendo had trans-
ferred to Hiroshi Yamauchi, Fusajiro’s grandson. 
He expanded the company’s card business by 
introducing plastic-coated cards in 1953 and, in 
1959, signed on with Walt Disney Co. to sell cards 
printed with popular Disney characters. The new 
Disney-branded cards took the Japanese play-
ing-card market out of the illegal gambling dens 
and expanded it to the family home. Nintendo 
sold a record 600,000 packs of cards of the year 
the Disney printings were introduced.

This chapter also gives you some advice on hunting down your very own Wii 
(or helping a friend hunt down a Wii, if you already own one).
I learned much of the history in the sidebars in this chapter from David 
Sheff’s excellent book Game Over: How Nintendo Zapped an American 
Industry, Captured Your Dollars and Enslaved Your Children (published 
by Random House). Check it out for a much more thorough account of 
Nintendo’s early history.
Wii Development and Unveiling
Even while releasing the GameCube system in 2001, Nintendo was already 
beginning the planning for its follow-up system, then codenamed Revolution. 
From the outset, Nintendo wanted the Revolution to take the video game 
market in a new direction. Instead of trying to make a system with the most 
powerful technology or the most realistic graphics, Nintendo was going to 
attempt to change the fundamental way people played games. “The consen-
sus was that power isn’t everything for a console,” said legendary Nintendo 
game designer Shigeru Miyamoto, the man behind Donkey Kong and Super 
Mario Bros., in a 2007 interview with BusinessWeek. “Too many powerful con-
soles can’t coexist. It’s like having only ferocious dinosaurs. They might fight 
and hasten their own extinction.”
Nintendo president Satoru Iwata confirmed this new direction for the com-
pany when he announced the existence of the Revolution project to the 
world at a 2004 press conference. “Today’s consoles already offer fairly real-
istic expressions, so simply beefing up the graphics will not let most of us see 
a difference,” he said. “The definition for a new machine must be different. 
I want you to know that Nintendo is working on our next system and that 
system will create a gaming revolution. Internal development is underway.”
Despite this continued success, Yamauchi 
wasn’t satisfied managing a playing-card com-
pany. In the 1960s, Nintendo experimented with 
marketing and selling a variety of different prod-
ucts, eventually expanding into the toy business. 
Plastic toys like the Ultra Hand (an extendable 
grabber), the Ultra Machine (an indoor ping-
pong-ball-pitching machine), and the Ultra 
Scope (a toy periscope) were marketed heav-
ily on TV, and sold through Nintendo’s already 
established network of retailers.
Nintendo jumped to electronic toys in the early 
‘70s with the Nintendo Beam Gun, a light-
emitting rifle that activated small, light-sensitive 
cells which caused a set of plastic barrels to 
explode. Nintendo used this same essential tech-
nology to convert a series of abandoned bowling 
alleys into virtual skeet-shooting ranges. When 
these light-gun ranges fell out of style, Nintendo 
headed back to the home market, selling a 
licensed version of a Magnavox-made, Pong-
style game in Japan in 1977. Nintendo had finally 
entered the video-game business.

 Chapter 1: How the Wii Came to Be
The rise and fall of a video-game giant
In 1981, Nintendo caught the crest of the huge 
arcade-gaming wave with Donkey Kong. The 
game was notable for its basic story (told 
through animated cut scenes), run-and-jump 
gameplay, and one of the first identifiable human 
characters in a game (who would eventually be 
known as Mario the plumber). The game sold 
hundreds of thousands of units to arcades in 
Japan and the United States. Nintendo had 
further success with a few follow-up arcade 
games, and with a popular line of miniature, 
handheld games known as Game and Watch.
This early success in the arcade game market 
was all a drop in the bucket, though, compared 
to the overwhelming reaction to Nintendo’s 
Family Computer, or Famicom. First released in 
Japan in 1983, the home system became a hit — 
thanks, in part, to Super Mario Bros., one of the 
first action games to feature a smooth-scrolling 
background. Nintendo brought the Famicom 
to the United States in 1985 as the Nintendo 
Entertainment System (NES). The American 
market was initially wary of the Japanese-made 
system, but the system slowly built up momen-
tum and eventually took over 90 percent of the 
American video-game market, By the early 
‘90s, there was a NES in nearly one in three 
American households. The name “Nintendo” 
was synonymous with “video games.”
Nintendo followed up the phenomenal success 
of the NES with the even more phenomenal suc-
cess of the Game Boy in 1989. One of the first 
portable systems to support interchangeable 
games stored on plastic cartridges, the Game 
Boy fended off competition from more powerful 
portables thanks to a lower price, longer battery 
life, and exclusive rights to the addictive puzzle 
game Tetris. The Game Boy line sold over a 
hundred million units worldwide over the next 
two decades.
Nintendo’s success on the home-gaming front 
was not as consistent. After achieving market 
dominance with the NES, Nintendo was slow 
to react when Sega’s more powerful Genesis 
system started to find some success in the 
early ‘90s. By the time the new Super Nintendo 
Entertainment System was released, Sega had 
enough of a foothold to gain control of nearly 
half the home gaming market.
In the mid-90s, Nintendo’s market posi-
tion eroded further in the face of the Sony 
PlayStation, whose compact-disc-based games 
made similar games on the new Nintendo 
64 system look like relics from long ago. By 
the dawn of the new millennium, Nintendo’s 
GameCube and Microsoft’s new Xbox system 
were fighting over the market scraps left behind 
by Sony’s PlayStation 2, which was becoming 
nearly as dominant in the marketplace then as 
the NES had been almost 20 years prior. Two 
decades after the NES launched in America, 
“PlayStation” was now synonymous with 
“video games” to an entire generation of play-
ers. Nintendo needed something big to turn its 
market position around. That “something big” 
turned out to be the Wii.
Among avid gamers, rumors started flying about what, exactly, Nintendo 
had planned for its mysterious Revolution. Some speculated that the system 
would include a controller with a built-in touch screen, similar to the com-
pany’s recently released Nintendo DS handheld. Others thought the control-
ler might include a built-in microphone for voice-controlled gaming, or a 
modular design with specialized, snap-off sections. There were a few gamers 
who even envisioned fanciful concepts for three-dimensional virtual reality 

12
Part I: The Basics 
helmets or projection systems that transformed the entire living room into a 
magical play space.
It wasn’t until the Tokyo Game Show in September 2005 that Nintendo finally 
halted the speculation by revealing a prototype of its unique new remote con-
troller. Selected members of the gaming press got to try out the controller on 
a series of specially designed demos that showed off the Remote’s ability to 
sense the movement of the player’s hand. Initial reactions among the press 
were cautiously optimistic. A writer at 1UP.com said the Remote initially 
made his arms and hands tired, “but once I sat down and relaxed, resting my 
hands on my legs as I would with a normal controller, everything clicked.” A 
writer from gaming website IGN said it was “easy to imagine why Nintendo is 
so heavily invested in the idea. There is such great potential to do so many 
unique things.”
This initial enthusiasm turned to confusion, though, when Nintendo revealed 
the final name for its new system in early May 2006. From then on, what 
had been known as Project Revolution would officially be known as the Wii. 
Nintendo explained the new name in a press release, saying in part that, “Wii 
sounds like ‘we,’ which emphasizes that the console is for everyone. Wii can 
easily be remembered by people around the world, no matter what language 
they speak. No confusion. No need to abbreviate. Just Wii.”
The press wasn’t so understanding. Journalists, developers and gamers 
around the world made fun of the system’s name with less-than-wholesome 
homonyms. Some in the industry thought it was a joke, intended to get some 
free press from the marketing world. A few gamers even tried to boycott 
the name, continuing to call the system Revolution long after that name was 
officially dead. Over time, though, the initial shock seems to have worn off, 
and today most gamers can talk about their Nintendo Wii with a completely 
straight face.
By the end of May 2006, Nintendo was ready to let a wider audience of indus-
try insiders try out the Wii for the first time at the Electronic Entertainment 
Expo, an annual game industry trade show. Crowds flocked to Nintendo’s 
booth throughout the three-day event, snaking around the Los Angeles 
Convention Center and waiting up to four hours to get into the small dem-
onstration area. The long wait was worth it, to be among the first gamers 
anywhere to try demos of games like Wii Sports, Super Mario Galaxy, and The 
Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.
On September 14, 2006, Nintendo finally revealed that the Wii would launch 
in the United States just two months later, on November 19, at a price of $250. 
This put the system’s launch just two days after that of Sony’s PlayStation 3, 
the $500-to-$600 follow-up to the then-dominant PlayStation 2. Both new sys-
tems also had to contend with Microsoft’s Xbox 360, which had launched to 

13
 Chapter 1: How the Wii Came to Be
great fanfare nearly a year before. The Wii was heavily outclassed in terms of 
processing power and the support of many prominent game developers.
When November 19 finally came around, eager Nintendo fans lined up out-
side their favorite gaming stores to be the first to own the long-awaited 
system. The entire stock was sold out within hours, and new shipments were 
hard to come by for the remainder of 2006 — meaning gamers who didn’t 
plan ahead missed out on the holiday season. Early reviewers were gener-
ally impressed with the Wii’s unique controller and its prospects of getting 
game players off the couch, but some were underwhelmed by the system’s 
decidedly last-generation graphics and (initially) thin library of games. Some 
predicted the system would be a flash in the pan — a gimmicky impulse buy 
that would get a lot of attention initially before being relegated to the back of 
America’s collective closet.
As the months went by, though, this proved not to be the case. While the 
Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 eventually recovered from the holiday rush and 
became widely available at retailers nationwide, stocks of the Nintendo Wii 
remained sparse well into 2007. A combination of a lower price and a grow-
ing public fascination with the system’s unique controller led to shortages 
across the country. Some suspected Nintendo of purposely creating a false 
shortage, but consumers were simply buying up everything Nintendo’s 
revamped production line could produce — the system routinely outsold the 
competition month after month. The problem only got worse as the 2007 holi-
day season came around and the Wii was still hard to come by. To this day, 
potential Wii owners have to be a little bit lucky to find a Wii on the shelves 
(see the next section).
Game publishers that had been wary of Nintendo in years past flocked to the 
successful Wii, increasing the system’s game library to over 200 games as of 
this writing. Nintendo continued development as well, releasing new games 
and Channels, as well as innovative new controllers such as the Balance 
Board that comes with Wii Fit. In early 2008, Nintendo surpassed the ten-
million-unit threshold in worldwide sales. In the summer of 2008, Nintendo 
overcame Microsoft’s year-long head start to become the best-selling system 
in North America. Upcoming peripherals like Wii MotionPlus and games like 
Wii Music seem set to continue Nintendo’s now successful video game revolu-
tion.
Finding a Wii
If you’re reading this book, you probably already have a Wii. Even so, you 
may have a friend, or a neighbor, or a jealous cousin who just can’t seem to 
find the system in his or her local store. Take pity on your fellow gamers by 

14
Part I: The Basics 
sharing these handy tips for finding the extremely hard-to-find Wii out in the 
retail wild:
 
 Visit your local stores constantly: Most game and electronics stores 
don’t know when exactly their next shipment of Wiis will come in; the 
inventory of new systems tends to disappear within hours (or even 
minutes) after they arrive. This means that finding a Wii in stock at your 
local store is largely a matter of luck. You can increase your chances by 
stopping by frequently to ask about the store’s inventory.
 
 You can also call local stores to ask about inventory, but be warned: By 
the time you get in the car and drive to the store, the systems might be 
out of stock yet again. . . .
 
 Keep an eye on Sundays: While there’s no precise schedule to when 
stores receive their shipments of Wiis, some stores stockpile systems 
and make them available on Sundays, to coincide with newspaper cir-
culars. It couldn’t hurt to make yet another trip out first thing Sunday 
morning.
 
 Use the Web: Sites like www.WiiTracker.com and www.NowInStock.
net/wii keep track of Wii availability at a variety of online stores. 
These sites aren’t 100-percent reliable, but they’re a good way to find 
out which Web sites might have a Wii to sell you at any given moment.
 
 Buy a bundle: With the Wii shortage still in full swing, many online and 
brick-and-mortar retailers only sell Wiis in bundles, together with vari-
ous games and accessories. These bundles may have some items you 
don’t necessarily want, and they cost more than a system by itself. That 
said, bundles tend to remain in stock much longer than unadorned sys-
tems, so you’ll probably have better luck finding one.
 
 Use eBay: New Wii systems are generally plentiful on this popular auc-
tion site. The only catch: You usually have to pay a slight premium over 
the suggested retail price of $250 to compete with your fellow potential 
buyers. See eBay For Dummies, 5th Edition, by Marsha Collier (Wiley 
Publishing, Inc.) for more on finding good deals in online auctions.
 
 Recruit family: When my sister wanted a Wii, she recruited me to climb 
out of bed early on a frigid Sunday morning in January to scope out 
my local stores. She ended up finding a system before I actually had to 
leave the house, but her theory was sound — increase your chances by 
increasing the number of searchers.

at your local toy store, but it all paid off now that you have that bright white 
box in your hands. Congratulations, you’re the proud owner of a brand new 
Nintendo Wii.
Now what?
In this chapter, you find out how to assemble the myriad pieces that come 
in the Wii box into a fully functioning gaming and entertainment system. You 
discover how to plug everything in, how to adjust the system settings to your 
personal tastes, and how to keep young children from getting at the stuff they 
aren’t supposed to. The setup and calibration aren’t just going to happen by 
themselves, so jump right in. . . .
Opening the Box
Inside that sleek white box, the Wii and its components are encased in card-
board, Styrofoam, plastic bags, and tape. Remove all this detritus and lay 
everything out as shown in Figure 2-1. Use the following list to make sure you 
have every piece:
 
 Wii console: The white rectangle with a slot for inserting discs. Be care-
ful when handling the console because it contains sensitive electronics 
(see the “Caring for your Wii” sidebar).

16
Part I: The Basics 
 
 Wii console stand: This comes in two parts: a rectangular gray stand 
and a clear, flat plastic Wii stand plate. Make sure you have both handy.
 
 Wii Remote: The hand-held white rectangle with buttons on it. This is 
your primary controller. Make sure you also unpack the two included 
AA batteries and the clear plastic Wii Remote sleeve. See Chapter 3 for 
more on how to use the Wii Remote.
 
 Nunchuk: The rounded white hand unit with a thumbstick sticking up 
from the top and a wire hanging down from the bottom. Named after the 
nunchaku, the martial arts weapon it resembles when plugged into the 
Wii Remote. See Chapter 3 for more on how to use the Nunchuk with the 
Wii Remote.
 
 Sensor Bar: The thin black bar with a long, thin wire running from 
the back. Make sure you also unpacked the clear plastic pedestal and 
included sticky tape to affix the bar to your TV.
 
 Wii AC adapter: The thick, rectangular gray block with power cords 
coming out both sides.
 
 Wii Audio/Video cable: A standard composite A/V cable with red, 
yellow, and white inputs for your TV. Your home entertainment setup 
may require or support other cables to hook up to the Wii. See the later 
section, “Getting the Rest of What You Need.”
 
 Wii Sports game disc: The disc is in a labeled paper sleeve. (See 
Chapter 12 for more playing on Wii Sports.)
 
 Manuals: The box includes two Wii Operations Manuals: System Setup 
and Channels and Settings; plus a Quick Setup foldout card and a Wii 
extended warranty pamphlet.
Caring for your Wii
Although the white plastic exterior might make it 
look like a toy, the Wii is actually a complicated 
piece of electronics. As such, it’s susceptible to 
damage if you don’t treat it gently. Here’s some 
general advice for making sure your Wii contin-
ues to work properly for a long, long time:
  Don’t expose the system to extreme 
temperatures.
  Don’t drop the system or jostle it violently.
  Don’t spill water or other liquids on the 
system.
  Don’t obstruct the air intakes on the back 
and bottom of the system.
  Don’t stand the system up vertically without 
the included Wii System Stand.
  Don’t pull or bend the attached cables at 
sharp angles.
  Keep the system out of humid environments.

While the preceding list covers everything included in the basic Wii packag-
ing, some retailers sell the Wii as part of a bundle with extra games, remotes, 
and possibly other accessories. Check the packaging and manuals to make 
sure you have all the items that should be included.
Getting the Rest of What You Need
Although the Wii box technically has everything you need to start enjoying 
your new system immediately, there are a few other items that you might 
want to look in to in order to get the most out of your Wii experience. These 
include:

18
Part I: The Basics 
 
 Broadband modem and/or wireless router: These are required to con-
nect the Wii to the Internet and enjoy the system’s online functions. 
You also need to subscribe to a high-speed Internet service through an 
Internet service provider (See Chapter 4 for more on getting the Wii onto 
the Internet).
 
 SmartDigital (SD) card: These portable, miniature memory cards can 
be used to back up saved game data, transfer data between Wiis, and 
transfer photos and music onto your system. (See Chapter 8 for more on 
using SD cards for photos and music and Chapter 16 for more on how to 
choose an SD card.)
 
 GameCube memory card: These are necessary to save data for 
GameCube games played on the Wii. (See Chapter 16 for more on 
GameCube memory cards.)
 
 Component cables: These cables provide a higher-quality image on 
enhanced-definition and high-definition TVs. You can purchase official 
Wii-compatible component cables for $29.95 from Nintendo by visiting 
http://store.nintendo.com/componentvideocable or by calling 
1-800-255-3700. Third-party cables are also available from many elec-
tronics and gaming retailers for about $10 to $20. (See the later section, 
“Setting Up Your System,” for information on calibrating the system to 
work with component cables.)
 
 Additional controllers: To play most multiplayer games (including many 
of those included on the included Wii Sports disc), you need to buy extra 
controllers. Wii Remotes generally retail for $40 and Nunchuks run you 
$20 each at major retailers. Additionally, you may need a GameCube 
controller or Wii Classic Controller to play certain games. See Chapters 
3 and 6 for more advice on which controllers you need for which games.
 
 Additional games: Although the packaged Wii Sports disc is great, the 
Wii can play a library of hundreds of games — including classic discs 
designed for the Nintendo GameCube. (See Part III for recommendations 
on which games are right for you and your family.)
 
 Accessories: Since the Wii was released, many companies have released 
optional accessories to increase the functionality and style of your 
system. (See Chapter 16 for more on which accessories to look for and 
which to avoid.)
Hooking Up Your System
All right, you’ve got everything out of the box and you know how to tell a 
Sensor Bar from a Wii Remote. Now you need to hook it all up. The following 
steps show you how to hook up the Wii so you’ll be playing with your system 
before you know it:

19
 Chapter 2: Getting to Know the Wii
 
1. Choose a location for the Wii.
 
 Pick a space in your entertainment center or TV area where the Wii can 
rest level and comfortably. Note that the Wii can sit either horizontally 
or vertically, depending on the layout of your entertainment center. 
Make sure the location you choose has plenty of ventilation and that the 
air vents on the back of the system won’t be blocked. Also make sure 
you have easy access to the back of the system because you need to 
plug in a variety of components back there in the next steps.
 
a. If you’re setting the system up vertically, you need to place it in 
the Wii System Stand to make sure it’s stable and properly venti-
lated. First, slide the clear plastic Wii Stand Plate into the slots on 
the bottom of the stand. (This process is shown in greater detail in 
Figure 2-2.) Then lower the console into the top of the stand so the 
front is pointing toward the elevated side.
 
b. If you’re setting the system up horizontally, you do not need to use 
the Wii System Stand — simply put the system in place so the disc 
slot is located above the buttons on the face of the system. Set the 
two pieces of the System Stand aside and proceed to Step 2.

2. Connect the A/V cable to the system and TV.
 
 Connect the rectangular gray end of the Wii A/V cable to the back of the 
Wii in the slot labeled AV Multi Out (see Figure 2-3). Connect the red, 
yellow, and white prongs on the other end of the cable to the appropri-
ate inputs on your TV. Note that some home entertainment setups may 
require you to plug the Wii into a VCR or cable box instead of directly 
into your TV — consult the documentation for these devices for more 
information.
 
 Some older TVs don’t have the standard yellow, red, and white A/V 
input ports needed for the Wii A/V cables. Don’t fret — you might be 
able to connect the system to your TV using a generic radio-frequency 
(RF) modulator. This device converts the Wii A/V cables into an RF input 
that can be plugged into a TV’s coaxial cable input. These generally sell 
for $5 to $20 and can be found at any specialty electronics retailer.
 
3. Connect the Sensor Bar.
 
 The Sensor Bar is used by the Wii Remote to detect its position relative 
to your TV. As such, it’s very important that the Sensor Bar sits near the 
TV with an unobstructed view of the area where people will be control-
ling the Wii.
 
 First, decide whether you want the Sensor Bar to sit on the top of your 
TV or on the bottom. Either way, align it so the center of the Sensor 
Bar is lined up with the center of the TV. Make sure the Sensor Bar sits 
parallel to the screen and roughly level with the ground, with the shiny, 
black side pointing directly out from the TV. See Figure 2-4 for an exam-
ple of correct placement.
 
 Use the included plastic stand and double-sided tape to secure the 
Sensor Bar in place, if necessary. When the bar is placed, thread the 
cable behind the TV and plug it into the orange Sensor Bar slot on the 
back of the system (refer to Figure 2-3).

 With some entertainment-center setups (such as those using a rear pro-
jector) it’s possible that the Sensor Bar cable won’t be long enough to 
reach to the system. Don’t panic; independent accessory makers have 
made wireless sensor bars that can be placed independently of the Wii 
system itself. No special setup is required for these sensor bars — just 
place them as described in the preceding paragraphs and continue 
setup as normal. Wireless sensor bars are available for $20 at many 
major retailers.
 
4. Plug in the AC adapter.
 
 The end with the electrical plug goes into a standard 120 V AC wall outlet. 
The rectangular end goes into the slot labeled 12V=IN on the back of the 
system (refer to Figure 2-3). After you plug in the AC adapter, a small red 
light should appear on the power button on the front of the Wii.
 
5. Put the batteries in the Wii Remote.
 
 Remove the battery cover from the back of the Wii Remote and place the 
two AA batteries in the indentation. Make sure the positive and negative 
sides of the batteries line up with the instructions printed on the inside 
of the Remote. Replace the battery cover.

22
Part I: The Basics 
 
 The Wii Remote goes through regular alkaline batteries like a child tear-
ing through wrapping paper on Christmas morning. Consider investing 
in some rechargeable batteries to keep your Remote going through 
extended play sessions. See Chapter 16 for more on rechargeable bat-
tery packs and chargers designed specifically for the Wii Remote.
 
 If you’re using a Wii Remote other than the one that came packaged with 
your system, it may need to be synchronized with the Wii before use. 
See Chapter 3 for more information on synchronizing Remotes to your 
system.
 
6. Turn on your TV and then your Wii.
 
 Turn on the TV and choose the appropriate input setting for the slot you 
plugged the Wii in to (consult your TV or VCR manual for more informa-
tion on selecting the correct input). Push the Power button on the front 
of the Wii. If everything is set up correctly, the light on the power button 
should turn green and a generic safety message should appear on your 
TV. If you don’t see the message, double check all wire connections and 
make sure the TV input is set correctly.
 
 Push the A button on the Wii Remote and you see the Wii Channel menu, 
shown in Figure 2-5. Congratulations! Your Wii is on and working!

cessful Wii 
installation.
 
Now that your system is on, you need to know how to turn it off. You also 
need to know how to use the other various buttons on the system itself. 
These are shown in Figure 2-6 and detailed in the following list:

23
 Chapter 2: Getting to Know the Wii
 
 Power button: Turns the system on and off. Press the button briefly 
to send the system to standby mode, where the WiiConnect24 Internet 
service will continue to work (see Chapter 4 for more on WiiConnect24). 
Hold down the button for three seconds to turn the system off 
completely.
 
 Power LED: This light shows the current status of the Wii. It has three 
settings.
 
• Green: The system is on.
 
• Orange: The system is in Standby mode and able to receive data 
from WiiConnect24. See Chapter 4 for more on WiiConnect24.
 
• Red: The system is completely off and not receiving data from 
WiiConnect24. To force the system to this state when WiiConnect24 
is on, hold down the power button for three seconds.
 
 Reset: Press this button to restart the system.
 
 SYNCHRO button: Used to synchronize the Wii with new Wii Remotes 
so they can be recognized by the system. Note that this button is hidden 
behind a small white cover. See Chapter 3 for more on synchronizing 
Remotes.
 
 SmartDigital card slot: Used for memory-expanding SD cards. Note this 
slot is hidden by a protective white cover. See Chapter 8 for more on 
inserting and using SD cards with the Wii and Chapter 16 for how to pick 
out an SD card.
 
 Eject: Press this button to remove the disc currently in the disc slot.
 
 Game disc slot: This is where both Wii and GameCube game discs are 
inserted. Make sure the shiny side of the disc is facing down (if the 
system is in its horizontal position) or to the left (if the system is stand-
ing vertically).

Part I: The Basics 
Setting Up Your System
When your Wii is hooked up and blasting audio and video out of your TV, 
the next thing to do is calibrate it to your exact specifications using the Wii 
Settings menu. In this section, I walk you through the menu’s many options 
and help you decide which settings to use.
 
Before moving on, you need to have a basic familiarity with using the Wii 
Remote to move the on-screen pointer and clicking on-screen options with 
the A button. (Chapter 3 provides more details on using the Wii Remote.)
To calibrate your Wii, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Wii Settings menu by clicking the Wii icon in the lower-left 
corner of the Wii Channel menu (see Figure 2-5).
 
2. Click Wii Settings to bring up the menu shown in Figure 2-7.
 
3. Click the arrows on the left and right sides of the screen to scroll 
through the various pages of menu items.
 
 Pressing the + and – buttons on the Wii Remote has the same effect.
 
4. Click the on-screen menu options to bring up the submenus described 
in the list shown in the next step.
 
5. When you’re done adjusting a specific setting, click OK or Confirm 
to save your settings, or click Back to return to the Wii Settings menu 
without saving your changes.
 
Figure 2-7: 
The first 
page of the 
Wii Settings 
menu.
 

25
 Chapter 2: Getting to Know the Wii
The Wii Settings menu contains the following options:
 
 Console Nickname: This is pretty straightforward — a nickname your Wii 
will use to identify itself when it connects to other Wiis via the Internet. 
Click the white text-entry area, and then use the on-screen keyboard to 
enter your desired nickname (see Chapter 4 for more on the on-screen 
keyboard). Your console nickname can have up to ten characters.
 
 Calendar: Set the Wii’s internal date and time via this menu option. Click 
either Date or Time on the submenu, and then click the arrows to adjust 
the appropriate numbers up and down. Note that the Wii uses a 24-hour 
clock, so 6:00 p.m. reads as 18:00.
 
 The Wii doesn’t support any dates past Dec. 31, 2035. (If you’re reading 
this book in 2036 for some reason, may I suggest upgrading your video 
game system already? I’m sure gaming has advanced quite a bit since 
the Wii came out.)
 
 Screen: The four submenu options on this screen let you adjust how the 
Wii’s video signal displays on your TV:
 
• Screen Position: On some TVs, the image output by the Wii may 
appear slightly off center. The Screen Position option lets you fix 
this problem by clicking the blue arrows until the red box is cen-
tered on your screen.
 
• Widescreen Settings: If you’re playing the Wii on a widescreen 
TV (one with a 16:9 aspect ratio), you can use this menu option to 
adjust the Wii’s output to stretch across the entire screen. If you 
choose the widescreen option, the Wii reminds you to make sure 
your TV is set to widescreen mode. Heed the Wii’s advice. The Wii 
is wise and all-knowing.
 
• TV Resolution: If you’re using the optional Wii component cables 
(see the earlier section, “Getting the Rest of What You Need”), 
you can use this option to set the Wii’s output to 480p enhanced 
definition. If you are using the included composite A/V cables, this 
option is inaccessible.
 
• Screen Burn-in Reduction: This function helps prevent damaging 
burn-in on some TV models. When this option is turned on, the 
on-screen image fades out when a Wii game is paused for five or 
more minutes; push any button on the Wii Remote to return to full 
brightness and resume play. Note that this feature does not work 
when playing GameCube games on the Wii.
 
 Sound: Toggle between Monaural, Stereo, or Surround sound, depend-
ing on your entertainment setup.

26
Part I: The Basics 
 
 Parental Controls: This submenu is a little bit complicated, but impor-
tant to set up if you want to prevent children from accessing restricted 
content on the Wii.
 
 The first time you enter the Parental Controls submenu, you’re asked 
to enter a four-digit PIN code by clicking the white box and using the 
on-screen numeric pad. You need this code later if you want to access 
restricted content or edit the parental control settings, so it’s important 
you don’t forget it. (You may want to use the same PIN you use at your 
local bank ATM.)
 
 After you enter the code a second time for confirmation, you’re asked to 
choose a secret question that you’ll be asked if you forget your PIN. Be 
sure to pick a question that your child or children (or any kids who may 
visit) won’t know the answer to — and, more importantly, one that you’ll 
remember the answer to if and when you need it. Click on the white box 
and use the on-screen keyboard to type in your answer (See Chapter 4 
for more on using the on-screen keyboard).
 
 If you forget your PIN, your answer has to match the one you enter here 
exactly. Spelling and capitalization count, so be careful.
 
 After this initial setup, you can access two further submenus, Game 
Settings and PIN and Other Settings. Also note that the Clear Settings 
button, at the bottom of the menu, can be used to reset and turn off the 
system’s parental controls.
 
• Game Settings and PIN: This option lets you edit your PIN and 
secret question after the initial setup. You can also choose which 
games are playable by players who don’t know your PIN (such 
as your children) by clicking the Highest Game Rating Allowed 
button, as shown in Figure 2-8.
 
 Games are grouped according to ratings assigned by the 
Entertainment Software Ratings Board, each of which is described 
on the screen as you scroll using the on-screen arrows. Choose the 
highest rating that you’re comfortable with your children playing 
and click OK. For even more about what each rating means, see 
Chapter 11.
 
 Wii Parental Control settings will not work with GameCube games 
played on the Wii.
 
• Other Settings: When you choose this option, the Wii asks you a 
series of questions about what sorts of online content should be 
available to your children. See Chapter 4 and the channel descrip-
tions in Part II for more about the Wii’s online functions and which 
ones might not be suitable for children.

 Sensor Bar: This submenu allows you to adjust two different settings 
relating to the Wii Sensor Bar:
 
• Sensor Bar Position: Use this option to tell the Wii where the 
Sensor Bar is situated in relation to your TV. This helps the Wii 
determine where your Remote is pointing in relation to the televi-
sion and makes pointing the Remote at the TV screen itself feel 
more natural. The Wii Remote still works if the wrong option is 
chosen, but the pointer may seem misaligned when the Wii Remote 
is pointed at the screen.
 
• Sensitivity: Use this option to control how the Wii Remote finds the 
Sensor Bar. After reading the on-screen messages, click OK twice to 
bring up a gray box with a sensitivity slider at the bottom, as shown 
in Figure 2-9. Point the Wii Remote at the Sensor Bar and two blink-
ing white dots should appear in the gray box. These dots should 
move as you move the Wii Remote relative to the Sensor Bar.
 
 If you see more than two dots, push the – button on the Wii 
Remote to lower the sensitivity until only two dots remain. You 
might also want to remove any other sources of bright light and 
any reflective surfaces near the Sensor Bar; these could interfere 
with the Remote’s operation.
 
 If you see no white dots, push the + button on the Wii Remote to 
increase the sensitivity until they do appear. If the sensitivity level 
is set to 5 and you still don’t see the dots, make sure the Remote is 
located the recommended three to eight feet from the Sensor Bar 
and that there’s nothing between the Sensor Bar and Wii Remote. 

28
Part I: The Basics 
Also make sure that the Remote is on and that the Sensor Bar is 
plugged in correctly.
 
 When the sensitivity is set correctly and the two white dots are 
blinking steadily and holding their position, press A to exit the cali-
bration screen.
 
 Bright lights or highly reflective materials near the Sensor Bar can 
affect the functioning of the Wii Remote.
 
 Internet: The options in this submenu are for setting up the Wii to talk 
to the Internet. (For much greater detail about configuring the Wii to 
work with the Internet, see Chapter 4.)
 
 WiiConnect24: This submenu controls the Wii’s ability to access the 
Internet automatically to download certain messages and updates. (See 
Chapter 4 for more about these options.)
 
 Language: Use this option to change the default language used by the 
Wii menus and games. Be careful playing around with this menu — if 
you set the menus to a language you don’t understand, it might be hard 
to get your Wii back to normal.
 
 Country: Select the country the system is being used in from the 42 
options listed. This setting determines what content you get on certain 
channels, including the Wii Shop Channel and the Everybody Votes 
Channel. Click the blue arrows on-screen to scroll through the list. Note 
that if you are using a Wii in a different region than it was bought from 
(among North America, Europe, and Asia), your country might not be 
available.
 
 Wii System Update: If you’ve connected your Wii to the Internet (see 
Chapter 4), you can use this option to update the Wii’s internal software 
with new features and bug fixes. Click Yes and then click I Accept to 
start the download process. If there’s a new update available, the Wii 
downloads and installs it automatically (this may take a few minutes). If 
your software is up to date already, the system tells you so. Either way, 
you’re returned to the Wii Channel menu when the process is done.
 
 It’s a good idea to attempt to download a system update as soon as pos-
sible after you first take your system out of the box, just to make sure 
that your Wii system software is up to date. Other than that, the system 
sends you a Message Board message or gives you an on-screen warning 
when a new system update is available or necessary; don’t worry about 
remembering to check for updates on your own. (See Chapter 5 for more 
about the Wii Message Board.)

29
 Chapter 2: Getting to Know the Wii
 
 Format Wii System Memory: Be very careful when selecting this option — 
because it will delete all downloaded channels and all saved data currently 
stored on the system. In general, the only reason you should even consider 
using this option is to erase your personal data if and when you’re plan-
ning on selling the system or returning it to the store. A Nintendo techni-
cal support representative might also tell you to use this option if your 
Wii is not working correctly. Otherwise, just stay away from it!

 Checking out specialized Wii controllers
F
or at least the past decade, most video-game controllers have seemed 
designed specifically to scare off newcomers. With their confusing 
arrangements of buttons, joysticks, and directional pads, it can be hard for 
a beginner to figure out how to hold many game controllers, much less use 
them effectively. Luckily, Nintendo eschewed this confusing convention with 
the Wii Remote — a simple, motion-based controller that resembles a TV 
remote more than a video-game controller.
Still, unlocking the full power of the Wii Remote takes some know-how (and a 
little practice). In this chapter you discover the ins and outs of the Wii Remote 
and how to use it effectively to control your Wii experience. You find out about 
the optional Nunchuk attachment that’s used to control some games. You also 
figure out how to choose which additional controllers you actually need from 
amongst the dizzying array of other Wii-compatible controllers.
Bonding with Your Wii Remote
The Wii Remote is different from standard console game controllers and 
joysticks — it’s easier and more intuitive to use, and it’s lots of fun, too!
The following sections get you familiar with your Wii Remote, from the place-
ment of the buttons to using it with the Wii Menu to describing the different 
motions you can make to control games.

32
Part I: The Basics 
Finding the buttons
Throughout this book, I refer to the buttons and indicators on the Wii 
Remote. These buttons are labeled on the controller itself (as shown in 
Figure 3-1) and described further in the following sections. While the specific 
function of each button depends on the menu and/or game being controlled, 
some buttons are often used consistently for the same function from game to 
game and Channel to Channel.
Front buttons
The following is a list of the buttons and other items on the front of the Wii 
Remote (see Figure 3-1):
 
Figure 3-1: 
The Wii 
Remote and 
its buttons.
 

33
 Chapter 3: Know Your Controllers
 
 Power: Hold this button down for two seconds to turn the system on 
or off.
 
 Do not use this button if you want to turn off the Remote independently of 
the Wii system itself. (See “The Wii Remote Settings Menu” section later 
in this chapter for more on turning off the Remote by itself.)
 
 Directional pad: Used to scroll quickly through many menus and for 
directional input in many games. The directional pad is sometimes 
called the d-pad for short.
 
 A button: The A button is an all-purpose button used to make selections 
on many menus and perform the most frequent actions in many games.
 
 When this book refers to “clicking” an on-screen option, it means point-
ing at the option and pushing the A button.
 
 Home button: Pressing this button at any time pauses whatever you’re 
doing and brings up the Home Menu, as shown in Figure 3-2. From this 
menu you can click the on-screen buttons to return to the Wii Channel 
menu (see Chapter 5) to restart the current game or enter the Wii 
Remote Settings menu. When you’re playing downloaded WiiWare of 
Virtual Console games, you can use the Home menu to access the on-
screen Operations Guide. (See Chapter 6 for more on this.)
 
 – and + (minus and plus) buttons: In general, these buttons adjust slid-
ers and scroll through pages on many menus. Many games also use the + 
button as a Pause button.
 
 Speaker: The Wii Remote is the first video-game controller that can actu-
ally talk to you through this built-in speaker. The speaker volume can be 
adjusted or muted using the Wii Remote Settings menu (as described in 
the later section, “The Wii Remote Settings Menu”).
 
 1 and 2 buttons: Used primarily in games to control various in-game 
functions, especially in games that use the Remote’s horizontal configu-
ration. (See the later section, “Getting the right grip.”)
 
 Player LEDs: Used to indicate which controller is assigned to which in-
game player number, starting with Player 1 on the left and going through 
Player 4 on the right.
 
 When you turn on a Wii Remote, you might notice that some of the 
player LEDs blink as the controller connects to the system (see the later 
section, “Connecting Additional Remotes to the Wii”). The number of 
blinking lights corresponds roughly to the amount of charge left in that 
Remote’s batteries. All four lights blinking means a nearly full battery, 
three lights blinking means 75% charge, two lights blinking means 50% 
charge, and so on. (This information is also available on the Home menu, 
but it’s handy to know from the moment you turn on the controller.)

34

Rear buttons
The following buttons and other items can be found on the bottom or back 
of the Wii Remote (refer to Figure 3-1):
 
 B button: Push this button with your index finger to back out from 
many menus or perform secondary functions in games.
 
 In many Channels and games, you can push the A and B buttons 
together to virtually pick up an object with the on-screen pointer.
 
 Battery cover: As you probably guessed, this covers the battery 
housing. Remove it to insert the batteries and reach the SYNCRO 
button.
 
 SYNCRO button: Used to connect a new Wii Remote to the system for 
the first time. (See the later section, “Connecting Additional Remotes to 
the Wii,” for more about synchronizing a new remote.)
 
 Wrist strap: Wrap this around your wrist to keep the Remote from flying 
out of your hand and into your brand new 70-inch plasma screen TV 
during heated play. (See the later section, “Safety first.”)
 
 External extension connector: Use this to hook up optional controller 
accessories such as the Nunchuk and Wii Classic Controller (more about 
these controllers later in this chapter).

35
 Chapter 3: Know Your Controllers
Safety first
If you pay attention to the news, you may have heard some stories about the 
rash of property damage caused by Wii Remotes flying out of players’ over-
enthusiastic hands soon after the system launched. How can you avoid being 
featured in such an awful episode? Well, you could coat your entire house in 
a protective layer of bubble wrap. Or you could take advantage of the exten-
sive safety features Nintendo has devised for the Wii Remote, as detailed in 
the following subsections.
The wrist strap
Attached to the bottom of every Wii Remote, the Wrist strap is the main 
method for preventing massive damage from flying controllers. It ensures 
that if the Remote slips out from your sweaty hands, it won’t get very far 
before dangling harmlessly from your arm.
To put the wrist strap on, slide the adjustment strap up toward the remote, 
stick your hand through the loop, then tighten the adjustment strap around 
your wrist, as shown in Figure 3-3. The fit should be snug, but it doesn’t have 
to be too tight — there’s no need to cut off your circulation!
 
Figure 3-3: 
The Wii 
wrist strap.
 

36
Part I: The Basics 
Soon after the Wii was released, many users reported their wrist straps broke 
as the Remote flew from their hands, eliminating the entire point of the safety 
strap. Nintendo responded to these claims by recalling the original straps 
and replacing them with thicker, sturdier straps in December 2006, less than 
one month after the system’s North American launch. All Remotes made after 
December 2006 (including those currently sold in stores and included with 
new Wiis) have these new, stronger straps. If you have an old Remote with 
a weaker strap, you can request a replacement from Nintendo by using the 
online form at www.nintendo.com/consumer/strapreplace.jsp.
The Wii Remote Jacket
For a few months, Nintendo relied on the new, beefed-up wrist straps to save 
plasma screens and drywall from flying Remotes. Then, in October 2007, 
Nintendo beefed up the protection even further with a springy, clear plastic 
jacket. The appropriately named Wii Remote Jacket ensconces the Remote 
in a cushioned, protective field while still leaving all the buttons exposed, as 
shown in Figure 3-4. It also makes the Remote easier to grip through a series 
of textured grooves. It may look a little silly and feel like overkill, but trust 
me, you’ll be glad it’s there when a Remote inevitably flies out of your hand 
and bonks you or your friend on the head.

37
 Chapter 3: Know Your Controllers
A Remote Jacket is packaged with the Wii itself, and with all Wii Remotes 
currently sold in stores. If you need extra jackets for Remotes bought before 
October 2007, you can request them from Nintendo by using the online form 
at www.nintendo.com/consumer/jacket/jacketrequest.jsp.
Getting the right grip
In video-game controllers, as in golf, the correct grip is everything. There 
are two primary ways to hold the Wii Remote by itself. The first (shown in 
Figure 3-5) is the vertical position. This one-handed position is the basic grip 
used to navigate most Wii menus and channels, as well as to control many 
Wii games.
Notice how your thumb rests naturally on the large A button — you can also 
move your thumb to reach the other buttons on the face of the controller. 
Also notice how your index finger tucks into the indentation for the B button 
on the underside of the Remote. This position works just as well in either 
hand, making it perfect for both left- and right-handed gamers. Unless oth-
erwise noted in the text, this is the position used to navigate all menus dis-
cussed in this book.
The second configuration, shown in Figure 3-6, is called the horizontal posi-
tion. This two-handed configuration is similar to the way you would hold a 
GameCube or Xbox video-game controller, with the left thumb resting on the 
directional pad and the right thumb hovering above the 1 and 2 buttons. This 
configuration is primarily used to control certain classic games that require a 
more traditional control scheme. Note that you can use your left index finger 
to press the B button on the underside of the Remote, and that you can use 
your left thumb to reach over to press the central face buttons.
 
In either configuration, don’t forget to use the wrist strap and Wii Remote 
Jacket to protect the controller and the room from each other.
Basic Wii Remote actions
With most game controllers, pushing buttons is the only way the controller 
can talk to the system. With the Wii Remote, though, that’s only the begin-
ning. The Wii Remote is motion-sensitive; you can use it as a virtual pointer 
and as a moving analogue for real-world actions. These unique Remote fea-
tures are described in the following subsections.

38
Part I: The Basics

The Wii 
Remote,

vertical 
position.
 
Using the Remote as a pointer
Remember that Sensor Bar you set up near the TV (described in Chapter 2)? 
That little black bar lets you use the Wii Remote like a laser pointer to directly 
interact with menus and games. It couldn’t be simpler — just point the tip 
of the Remote at the Sensor Bar and a hand-shaped pointer appears on the 
screen. Move the remote slightly side to side or up and down and the on-
screen pointer moves along with it. You don’t need grand sweeping gestures to 
move the pointer around — small flicks of the wrist are enough to move from 
one corner of the screen to another.

39
 Chapter 3: Know Your Controllers
 
Figure 3-6: 
The Wii 
Remote, 
held in the 
horizontal 
position.
 
If the pointer isn’t showing up or is jumping around, here are a few things to 
keep in mind:
 
 Make sure the Remote is turned on and synced with the system, as 
described in the later section, “Connecting Additional Remotes to the Wii.”
 
 Make sure the Sensor Bar is positioned and plugged in correctly, as dis-
cussed in Chapter 2.
 
 Make sure the Sensor Bar sensitivity is set correctly. (See Chapter 2 for 
more on this.)
 
 Make sure there are no other strong light sources or reflective materials 
around the Sensor Bar or screen area.
 
 Make sure there’s nothing blocking the path from the Wii Remote to the 
Sensor Bar.
 
 Make sure you’re approximately 3 to 8 feet from the Sensor Bar, as 
shown in Figure 3-7.
 
 Make sure you’re actually pointing the remote at the Sensor Bar. Try jig-
gling the Remote around quickly to see if the pointer shows up.
While pointing at the screen, you can also use the Wii Remote buttons to 
interact with on-screen objects. Specific button functions depend on the con-
text, but there are a few general rules. You can usually push the A button to 
select on-screen items, for instance, while pushing and holding the A and B 
buttons together can pick up objects in games or Channels. Note that the Wii 
can also sense how close the Remote is to the screen; some games and chan-
nels use that function to let you push and pull on-screen objects (more about 
that shortly).

Feeling the motion
In addition to the pointer functionality, the Wii can also be used as a sort of 
magic wand that detects how it’s moved about in 3-D space. These motions 
can be quick and sharp or large and sweeping, depending on the game. Each 
game is different, so experiment with different motions until you get a feel for 
them.
While different games each have different motion controls, a few basic 
motions get used frequently. Note that the Wii detects these motions regard-
less of whether the Remote is pointed at the screen.
 
 Waving: Sweep the controller back and forth in a large arc. The Wii can 
detect a variety of different types of waves — up and down, side to side, 
a golf swing, and so on.
 
 Shaking: Shake the Wii Remote quickly in place. This is used to activate 
special moves or effects in many games.
 
 Tilting: Gently lean the controller up and down. This is often used in 
games to tilt an on-screen object or a piece of scenery.
 
 Twisting: Turn the Wii remote in your hand like a key. This is used to 
rotate objects in many games and channels.
 
Don’t start swinging the Wii Remote around without first putting on the wrist 
strap and Wii Remote Jacket. Make sure that you’re standing in a clear space 
when you’re playing, too — it’s really easy to bump into or knock over objects 
when you’re swinging the Remote. You don’t want to break an antique vase or 
knock a glass of grape juice onto the carpet.

 Chapter 3: Know Your Controllers
Connecting Additional 
Remotes to the Wii
With most video-game systems, connecting the controller to the system is as 
simple as plugging it in. Because the Wii Remote is wireless, however, getting 
the system to recognize additional controllers takes a few more (fortunately 
simple) steps.
Using the Remote that comes packaged with your Wii couldn’t be simpler — 
just turn on the system and press the A button on the Remote. Connecting 
further Remotes to your system for the first time involves a process known 
as syncing, which the upcoming steps walk you through.
 
Note that this process only has to be performed once for every new Remote 
used on a particular system. After a Remote is synced to a system, simply 
pressing the A button turns on the Remote and connect it to the system. 
A Remote stays synced to a specific system until it is synced to another 
system.
To synchronize a new Wii Remote to your Wii, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn on the Wii.
 
 Use the power button on the system itself, not the one on the Wii 
Remote.
 
2. Push the SYNCRO button on the Wii Remote.
 
 This button can be found beneath the battery cover, as shown in Figure 3-8. 
Make sure there are batteries in the Remote. The Player LED lights on the 
front of the Remote start blinking.
 
3. Push the SYNCRO button on the Wii itself.
 
 This button is found under the protective flap on the front of the system, 
as shown in Figure 3-8.
 
4. Watch for the lights on the Wii Remote to stop blinking.
 
 After a few seconds, the Player LEDs on the Remote stops blinking and 
a single light stays on consistently. The Remote is now synced with 
the system. The solid light on the Remote indicates which player 
number is assigned to the Remote, from Player 1 on the left to Player 4 
on the right.

The Wii Remote Settings Menu
Looking to turn off those annoying rumbling and speaker functions on your 
Remote? Trying to turn off a controller without turning off the system? Look 
no further than the Wii Remote Settings menu. This menu is accessible at any 
time by simply pressing the Home button on an active Wii Remote, and then 
clicking the Wii Remote Settings panel on the bottom of the screen (as shown 
in Figure 3-2). To leave the menu, click the Close Wii Remote Setting panel at 
the bottom of the screen, or simply push the Home button on the connected 
Remote.

43
 Chapter 3: Know Your Controllers
From the Remote Settings menu, you can alter the following settings:
 
 Volume: Click the on-screen + and – buttons to adjust the volume of 
the noise coming from the Wii Remote speakers. You can also use 
the + and – buttons on the Remote itself to make this adjustment. As 
you adjust the volume, the Remote emits a short tone at the currently 
selected volume level, to give you an idea of what to expect.
 
 All Wii Remotes connected to the system must share the same volume 
setting.
 
 Rumble: This option controls whether the Wii Remote vibrates to indi-
cate certain on-screen or in-game actions. The Remote rumbles slightly 
when the player clicks the On button on-screen.
 
 All Wii Remotes connected to the system must share the same rumble 
setting.
 
 Connection: Use this option to disconnect Remotes from the system 
without turning the system off.
 
1. Click the Reconnect button to temporarily disconnect all cur-
rently connected Remotes from the system.
 
 This turns off the Remotes.
 
2. Press the 1 and 2 buttons simultaneously on each Remote you 
want to reactivate.
 
 The Player LED lights blink for a few seconds, and then stabilize on 
a specific player light based on the order in which the Remote was 
reconnected.
 
 This method for connecting Remotes even works with controllers not 
formally synced to the system. This temporary syncing goes away when 
the system is turned off, though — making it most suitable for Remotes 
brought over temporarily from a friend’s house.
Whipping Out the Nunchuk
The preceding sections should make it clear how revolutionary the Wii 
Remote is, and how much it changes the way video-game systems are con-
trolled. For some games, however, a traditional thumb joystick is just more 
appropriate. For these games, you need to break out the Wii Nunchuk.
Plugging it in
Unlike the Wii Remote, the Nunchuk (yes, it really is spelled that way) is not 
wireless. Fortunately, you don’t have to tether the optional controller to the 

44
Part I: The Basics 
system itself — you just have to plug it in to the bottom of the wireless Wii 
Remote, as shown in Figure 3-9. If the Wii Remote is on and connected to the 
system, the Nunchuk is detected automatically as soon as it’s plugged in.
Note that there is a clear plastic tab on the back of the Nunchuk connector, 
used to thread the thin portion of the Wii Remote wrist strap. I personally 
find this thread hard to use and of limited use for holding the Nunchuk onto 
the Remote, but some people might find the Nunchuk feels more secure with 
it threaded in. Use your own discretion.
 
For those who just can’t abide that dangling Nunchuk wire, Nyko makes a 
wireless Nunchuk that’s available at most gaming retailers for $35.
 
The Nunchuk and Wii Remote are both designed to be used in either hand. 
This means you can hold the Remote in your right hand and the Nunchuk in 
your left, or vice versa. Both configurations work equally well — use which-
ever one feels more natural.
Nunchuk functions
The Nunchuk is a bit simpler than the Wii Remote, having only three major 
control functions, as shown in Figure 3-10.
 
 The analog stick: Like the directional pad on the Remote, this thumb-
stick is used mainly for directional input. Unlike the d-pad, the analog 
stick is sensitive enough to detect a wide variety of directions and inten-
sities. Tilting the stick slightly might cause an in-game character to walk, 
for instance, while pushing it all the way causes the character to sprint. 
The analog stick is controlled with the tip of the thumb, as shown in 
Figure 3-10.
 
 The C and Z buttons: The functions of the C button (the small, round 
one on the top) and the Z button (the large square one on the bottom) 
vary from game to game — consult the instruction manual to figure out 
what they’re used for in each game. These buttons should be pressed 
with the index or middle finger, as shown in Figure 3-10.
As the infomercial salesman might say, “But wait — there’s more!” The 
Nunchuk also has a motion sensor, much like the one in the Wii Remote, that 
can detect basic movement in all three dimensions. Games often ask you 
to flick, tilt, or twist the Nunchuk to activate additional in-game moves. The 
Nunchuk can’t be used as a pointer, though — which is why most Wii menus 
and Channels use the Remote by itself.

Part I: The Basics 
Going Retro with the Wii Classic 
and GameCube Controllers
Even with the Nunchuk attached, the Wii Remote is still a pretty poor approx-
imation of the traditional controllers found on classic Nintendo systems. 
There’s something about the button orientation and general feel of those 
older controllers that makes it awkward playing certain games with the Wii 
Remote and Nunchuk. Don’t fret: The Wii offers even more control options 
for the traditional gamer.
The Wii Classic Controller
With the wide variety of downloadable classic games available on the Wii’s 
Virtual Console (see Chapter 6), Nintendo needed a Wii controller that 
could mimic the layout and functionality of the Nintendo 64, Super Nintendo 
Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, Nintendo Entertainment System, and more. 
Their best effort at this is the Wii Classic Controller, shown in Figure 3-11.
How many Nunchuks do you need?
While the Wii box comes packaged with a 
Nunchuk to go along with your first Remote, 
additional Remotes and Nunchuks are sold 
separately in stores. This can lead to some 
confusion when it comes time to go to the 
cash register. The question at hand: Is the $40 
Remote enough, or do you need to add on a $20 
Nunchuk for each Remote you have?
The answer depends largely on what kinds of 
games you’re playing. The packaging for all 
Wii games contains a logo on the back of the 
box indicating whether the gameplay supports 
the Nunchuk. Games that support the Nunchuk 
tend to be action-oriented and/or first-person 
games that require quick reflexes and precise 
controls. Some games, such as the boxing por-
tion of Wii Sports, also use the Nunchuk to 
detect motion by the players second hand (in 
fact, the Wii Sports boxing game requires the 
purchase of a second Remote and Nunchuk for 
two-player bouts).
Be careful, though — some games with the 
Nunchuk logo on the box don’t really require 
the Nunchuk to play the game. Games like 
Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Mario Kart Wii 
can be controlled with or without the Nunchuk, 
meaning the number of Nunchuks you need 
depends largely on the control preferences of 
each player.
So what’s the answer? In short, I recommend 
holding off on the additional Nunchuks until you 
find an absolute need for them. Very few multi-
player games require multiple Nunchuks, and 
the add-ons will still be available in stores if and 
when you run into a game that requires them.

47
 Chapter 3: Know Your Controllers
 
Figure 3-11: 
The Wii 
Classic 
Controller.
 
The Classic Controller plugs into the bottom of the Wii Remote with a con-
nection similar to the one used for the Nunchuk (refer to Figure 3-9). As long 
as the Remote is on and connected to the system, the Wii automatically rec-
ognizes the Classic Controller — no extra setup is necessary.
The Wii Classic Controller may look intimidating, but it’s nothing to be afraid 
of. It’s held with two hands, much like the Wii Remote in its horizontal posi-
tion, with one thumb resting on each side. The left thumb is used for the 
directional pad and the left thumbstick, while the right thumb operates 
the four face buttons and the right thumbstick. The controller also has four 
“shoulder” buttons on the thin top edge which you can press with your index 
fingers. The functions of all these various buttons differ by game; they’re 
explained in the on-screen instructions for all Virtual Console downloads (see 
Chapter 6). The +, –, and Home buttons share the same functions as the simi-
lar buttons on the Wii Remote itself.
 
In addition to the standard buttons on the Classic Controller, you might also 
notice a small switch on the top edge of the controller. This switch opens 
and closes a small clamp on the back of the controller. While Nintendo hasn’t 
announced any official use for this clamp, peripheral maker Nyko utilizes it 
for its Classic Controller Grip, shown in Figure 3-12. This accessory snaps to 
the back of the Classic Controller and provides a more comfortable, molded 
grip for your palms. It also provides a place where you can wrap the Classic 
Controller Cord and hold the Wii Remote it’s attached to. This grip is available 
for $5 to $10 at most game retailers, and really improves the Classic Controller 
experience.
Note that the Classic Controller isn’t required to play Virtual Console games — 
some can be played with the Wii Remote and/or GameCube Controller. Also 
note that the classic controller can be used to control some disc-based Wii 
games, such as Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Mario Kart Wii. See Chapter 6 for 
more on which controllers work with which games.

The GameCube controller
You might already know that the Nintendo Wii comes with the added bonus 
of being able to play the hundreds of games designed for Nintendo’s previous 
system, the GameCube (see Chapter 5). But did you know that the Wii also 
lets you plug in classic GameCube controllers (see Figure 3-13) to use with 
those and other games? Well, now you know.
Besides being required for any GameCube game played on the Wii, the 
GameCube controller can also be used to control some Virtual Console titles 
(but not all: See Chapter 6). Some disc-based Wii games are also specifically 
designed to use the GameCube controller. These games can be identified by 
the small GameCube controller logo on the game’s packaging.
Unlike the Wii Remote, most GameCube controllers have wires and actually 
have to be plugged into the system to be used (but not all: see the sidebar 
“Wireless GameCube controls: The WaveBird”). The Wii does, in fact, have 
built-in ports to connect these controllers, but they’re not exactly easy to 
find when you’re staring at the Wii’s sleek, white exterior.

49
 Chapter 3: Know Your Controllers
 
Figure 3-13: 
The 
GameCube 
controller.
 
As shown in Figure 3-14, the GameCube controller ports are hidden under a 
small flap on the top of the system (or on the left of the system, if it’s sitting 
horizontally). Open up the flap and you can plug in up to four GameCube 
controllers at once. Each port has small indented dots above it correspond-
ing to the player number for that port (Player 1 is toward the front of the 
system, the Player 2 port is behind it, and so on). Figure 3-14 also shows the 
secondary flap used to protect the slots for GameCube memory cards — see 
Chapter 5 for more on using these.
Wireless GameCube controls: The WaveBird
Wii owners who are just obsessed with wireless-
ness should know that Nintendo has also made 
a wireless version of the GameCube controller. 
The WaveBird has the same button-and-joystick 
layout as the traditional GameCube controller, 
only it doesn’t have any wires (it also doesn’t 
support the vibration function of the traditional 
controller). The battery-powered controller com-
municates with the system using a small receiver 
that plugs into the appropriate controller slot on 
the GameCube or Wii. While Nintendo no longer 
makes the WaveBird, the controller is still avail-
able from many online and brick-and-mortar 
retailers for about $30.

Flipping up these protective flaps does tend to ruin the simple aesthetic of the 
Wii. Luckily, you can easily remove the flaps to maintain the integrity of the 
Wii’s look when using GameCube accessories. Simply open the flap and push 
gently toward the system right above the hinges. You hear a small click, and 
you can then lift the flap right up off the system. If you want to replace the 
flap, simply slide it back into place in the same manner.
Using Other Controllers
As if the four control options discussed previously weren’t enough, even 
more controllers and controller add-ons can be used to change up the Wii 
gameplay experience. Some of these controllers only work with specific 
games while others simply change the way the standard Wii Remote and 
Nunchuk are held in your hands. The major controllers and controller add-
ons available as I write are listed in the following sections. Who knows how 
many more there will be as the Wii continues to mature?

51
 Chapter 3: Know Your Controllers
Wii Balance Board
The next step in motion-based controls, the Wii Balance Board (shown in 
Figure 3-15) gets the whole body involved in the game. The board itself acts 
sort of like a fancy bathroom scale, detecting how much weight is being 
placed on it — and, more importantly, how that weight is distributed across 
the surface of the board. By shifting your weight back and forth and left to 
right, you can control specially designed games such as the fitness simula-
tor Wii Fit (which comes packaged with the board), and others that use the 
board to simulate everything from skiing to skateboarding. See Chapter 13 for 
more on Wii Fit and setting up the Balance Board with the Wii.
Wii Wheel
Not exactly a controller in and of itself, the Wii Wheel is a plastic, steering-
wheel shaped shell for the Wii Remote, as shown in Figure 3-16. While the Wii 
Wheel doesn’t add any specific functionality to the Wii Remote, it does make 
the controller feel more balanced and natural — more like a tiltable steering 
wheel for many racing games. The Wii Wheel comes packaged with Mario Kart 
Wii and can also be purchased on its own for $15 from many game retailers.

Wii Zapper
Much like the Wii Wheel, the Wii Zapper doesn’t add any functionality to 
the standard Wii Remote and Nunchuk. (See Figure 3-17.) It does, however, 
create a fun new way to control many shooting-based games. The Wii Zapper 
is designed to be held with two hands and aimed at the screen from waist 
height. An on-screen reticle shows where you’re aiming in certain games, like 
Link’s Crossbow Training, which is packaged with the $20 accessory. Other 
accessory makers make similar products to make the Wii Remote resemble a 
gun — see Chapter 16 for more on these options.

Wii Guitar Controller
This wireless Gibson Les Paul-shaped controller is (unsurprisingly) used 
to control Activision’s guitar simulator Guitar Hero 3, which it comes pack-
aged with. (See Figure 3-18.) A similar controller also comes with Rock Band, 
a competing game from Electronic Arts that also uses included drum and 
microphone controllers (see Chapter 14 for more on Rock Band). Note that 
the Guitar Hero controller works with Rock Band, but the Rock Band guitar 
controller won’t work with Guitar Hero III.

Part I: The Basics 
With either controller, you hold down the fret buttons on one end and strum 
the strummer on the other in time with the music and the on-screen instruc-
tions. The Wii remote slides into a slot in the back of the shell to provide 
motion-sensing and rumble functionality to the guitar. It’s not quite as reward-
ing as playing a real guitar, but it’s a lot easier, and almost as much fun.
Nintendo DS
The Wii’s Wi-Fi capabilities mean it can connect wirelessly with Nintendo’s 
other Wi-Fi equipped system, the portable Nintendo DS, shown in Figure 3-19. 
The latter can even be used as a controller for specially designed games like 
Pokemon Battle Revolution. The Nintendo DS can also be used to download 
demos of portable games offered from the Nintendo Channel, as discussed in 
Chapter 10.

ack in the day, computers and video-game systems sat alone in an 
electronic void. They were connected to their users by keyboards and 
controllers, but they weren’t connected to their fellow computers in any way. 
It seems like ancient history today, when even a low-cost computer can easily 
connect to the Internet, enabling people to communicate easily, worldwide.
Video-game console makers in general (and Nintendo specifically) have 
been a little slower than their computer-making brethren in embracing the 
Internet, but they’ve dived online in a big way in the last few years. The 
Wii is a prime example of this trend, allowing users to not only play games 
online with competitors from around the world, but also to send messages 
and photos to their friends, surf the Web, and even download entire games 
(discussed more in Part III). This chapter shows you how to get the Wii con-
nected to the Internet so you can unlock all these great features.
What You Need to Connect 
the Wii to the Internet
A discussion of how to set up a home network is beyond the scope of this 
book — for details, check out Home Networking For Dummies, 4th Edition, by 
Kathy Ivens (Wiley). Instead, this section outlines the basic items you need to 
get your Wii online.

56
Part I: The Basics 
To start with, getting the Wii online means having a high-speed Internet con-
nection of some sort in your home. For most people, this means signing up 
for Internet service through your local cable or DSL provider. Dial-up Internet 
service through basic phone lines will not work with the Wii.
 
In addition to your high-speed Internet connection, you need one of the follow-
ing Internet appliances to connect the Wii to your Internet connection:
 
 A wireless access point: Also known as an 802.11 wireless router, this 
device converts your wired Internet signal to a wireless signal that can 
be recognized by the Wii’s internal Wi-Fi antenna. To simplify the setup 
with your Wii, look for an access point with AirStation One-Touch Secure 
System (AOSS) support (it should be highlighted on the packaging). You 
may also want to choose an access point that supports WEP or WPA 
security so your neighbors can’t steal your wireless signal.
 
 The Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector: This small USB fob (shown in 
Figure 4-1) plugs into a personal computer with a wired high-speed 
Internet connection and broadcasts a Wi-Fi Internet signal recognizable 
by the Wii.

 Chapter 4: Getting the System Online
 
 Nintendo discontinued manufacture of the Wi-Fi USB connector in 
November 2007, but the ones they did make are still available from 
many online and brick-and-mortar retailers for about $30. This option 
is cheaper and easier to set up than a full-fledged wireless access point, 
but offers less utility for other wireless networking applications (such as 
connecting a laptop to your home network).
 
 The Wi-Fi USB Connector only works with computers running Windows XP.
 
 The Wii LAN Adapter: This compact device (shown in Figure 4-2) con-
verts a wired Ethernet cable into a USB connection that can plug into one 
of the USB slots in the back of the Wii. Note that using this option means 
the Wii needs to be physically close to your high-speed modem or router. 
The adapter can be purchased directly from Nintendo online at http://
store.nintendo.com or at many major retailers for about $25.

Configuring the Wii’s Internet Options
After you have your home network set up, you need to tell the Wii how it’s 
going to talk to the Internet. You do this through the Wii’s Internet Settings 
menu (shown in Figure 4-3). To get there, open the Wii Settings menu (as 
described in Chapter 2) and choose the Internet submenu on the second 
page of options.

 Chapter 4: Getting the System Online
 
1. Choose an open connection.
 
 The Wii can save up to three sets of Internet configuration data. Any 
connection labeled “None” is currently free and ready to be config-
ured. It doesn’t matter which connection number you choose, although 
Connection 1 seems the natural first choice for most users.
 
2. Choose your connection type.
 
 If you are using the Wii LAN Adapter (as described in the “What You 
Need to Connect the Wii to the Internet” section, earlier in this chap-
ter) choose Wired Connection. Make sure the LAN adapter is plugged 
into your modem or router through an Ethernet cable and into the Wii 
through the rear USB ports (refer to Figure 4-2). Skip ahead to Step 4.
 
 If you’re using a wireless access point or the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB 
Connection, choose Wireless Connection and continue to Step 3.
 
3. Choose your wireless connection type.
 
 If you’re using a wireless Internet connection, choose the option that 
applies and go through the specific instructions that follow. (Note that 
the Manual Setup option is reserved for advanced users and shouldn’t 
be necessary for basic setup.)
 
a. If your wireless access point supports the AirStation One-Touch 
Secure System, the AOSS menu option is the easiest way to configure 
the Wii to use your access point. Click AOSS and the Wii tells you 
to “press the AOSS button on the access point until the AOSS lamp 
flashes.” Do this and the Wii quickly detects the access point and 
automatically configures itself to your Internet connection. Simple!
 
b. If you’re using a wireless access point that doesn’t support AOSS, 
choose Search for an Access Point. The Wii spends a few seconds 
searching for nearby networks, and then displays a list of all those 
in range, along with their relative strength and security status. If 
your wireless network doesn’t show up, make sure your router is 
set to broadcast its SSID (consult your router documentation for 
more on how to do this). If you’ve enabled security on your wire-
less network, choose the type of security and enter the password, 
using the on-screen keyboard (remember, passwords are case-
sensitive). Click OK to save the settings.
 
c. If you’re using the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector, the system asks 
you to make sure you’ve installed the software included with the 
Connector on your PC, and that the Connector is plugged into a 
USB slot on your computer. After you’ve confirmed both of these 
facts, click Next and move over to your PC. A Wi-Fi USB icon 
appears in the Windows task bar. Double-click this icon, and then 
select your Wii system from the menu (the system shows up with 
the nickname you gave it when you set up the Wii). Choose Grant 
Permission to Connect and go back to the Wii, which confirms that 
the “Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector setup is complete.”

60
Part I: The Basics 
 
4. Click OK to begin the connection test.
 
 The Wii tries to communicate with the Internet, using the settings you 
configured. If the test is successful, then congratulations — your Wii is 
officially part of the Internet!
 
 You’re asked if you want to perform a Wii system update. You should 
probably take the Wii up on this offer — it’s generally a good idea when 
connecting your Wii to the Internet for the first time — but it’s by no 
means required. You can always perform the update later by choos-
ing the option from the Wii Settings menu (see Chapter 2 for more 
on this). If you do decide to download an update, be patient — the 
process can take a few minutes. If the connection test fails, see the 
“Troubleshooting” section for possible fixes.
Thankfully, you only have to perform this setup process the first time you 
connect your Wii to the Internet. The Wii saves your settings, and in the 
future uses them to connect automatically to the Internet when necessary.
To edit your Internet connection settings later, go back to the Connection 
Settings menu and choose a configured connection. From here you can also 
re-test the connection or clear its setting from the system. If you’ve defined 
multiple Internet configurations, you can also choose which one you want the 
Wii to use by choosing Use This Connection from this menu.
Troubleshooting
If your connection test doesn’t work after the initial setup, a few simple 
things could be wrong. The following list describes the most common fixes 
for connection problems:
 
 Confirm that all the pieces of your Internet connection setup are plugged 
in and working correctly.
 
 If possible, move the wireless access point or Nintendo USB Wi-Fi 
Connector closer to the Wii itself. This improves the wireless signal 
strength.
 
 Make sure that the wireless router’s MAC filtering function is off, or that 
the Wii’s MAC address is included on the approved devices list. You 
can find the Wii’s MAC Address by choosing Console Information in the 
Internet Settings Menu (refer to Figure 4-3).

 Chapter 4: Getting the System Online
the same way. That’s why they created the WiiConnect24 service to make use 
of that Internet connection even when the system isn’t being used. The always-
on WiiConnect24 service downloads data for the Wii Message Board and cer-
tain Channels (like the Forecast and News Channels) even when the system is 
sitting idly in standby mode.
For the Wii to do this, though, you have to first set up the WiiConnect24 ser-
vice through the Wii Settings menu. Access the Settings menu by clicking the 
Wii icon in the lower-right corner of the Wii Channel menu, and then open the 
WiiConnect24 submenu on the second page of options. You can then toggle 
the following submenu options:
 
 WiiConnect24: This option lets you turn the WiiConnect24 service on 
or off. I highly recommend leaving this feature on; it allows for a lot of 
neat features. If you really don’t want the Wii sending and receiving data 
without your input, turn it off.
 
 Standby Connection: This setting determines whether the WiiConnect24 
feature operates when the system is sitting in standby mode. If this 
option is switched off, WiiConnect24 only connects to the Internet when 
the system is on and being used.
 
 I recommend activating the standby connection, as it allows the Wii to alert 
you when you receive Message Board messages (see the following bullet) 
and allows for automatic download of other data. Don’t worry about the Wii 
sucking up all your Internet bandwidth — the service isn’t very demanding 
and shouldn’t interfere with other uses of your Internet services.
 
 Slot Illumination: When WiiConnect24 detects that you’ve received 
a message on your Wii Message Board, a blue light illuminates from 
behind the system’s disc slot to alert you. You can use this menu to turn 
this feature off or turn down the brightness of the light by choosing the 
Dim option.
Connecting to Your Friends: 
The Wii Message Board
Okay, so your Wii is online. Now what? Well, much like an Internet-connected 
computer, your Wii can now be used to send messages and photos to 
other users through the Wii Message Board. Unfortunately, connecting to 
your friends through the Wii isn’t quite as simple as jotting down an e-mail 
address and typing a quick message. This section navigates you through the 
somewhat cumbersome process of registering Wii Friends and sending them 
messages and photos.
To start with, you access the Message Board itself by going to the Wii 
Channel menu and clicking on the envelope icon in the bottom-right corner. 

62
Part I: The Basics 
This brings up the Message Board screen, as shown in Figure 4-5. From this 
screen you can register Wii friends on your system and send and receive 
messages and photos, using these options:
 
 Message envelopes: These represent messages you’ve received from Wii 
Friends or from the Wii itself. Click an envelope icon to read the message 
and view any attached photos. (You can enlarge an image by clicking on 
it.) The dot above the message blinks if the message is less than six hours 
old. You can move a message around the screen by holding down the A 
and B buttons and dragging the message into its new position.
 
 Change Days buttons: The Message Board only displays messages one 
day at a time, based on the day they were received. Click the arrow but-
tons on the right and left sides of the screen to scroll to adjacent days. 
Pressing the + and – buttons on the Wii Remote has the same effect.
 
 Calendar: Opens up the calendar screen as shown in Figure 4-6. Days on 
which you received messages are noted with an envelope icon. Click on 
a day to display that day’s messages. Use the blue arrows on the sides of 
the screen to scroll through the months. Pressing the + and – buttons on 
the Wii Remote has the same effect.
 
 Create message: Click this button to bring up the submenu shown 
in Figure 4-7. The options on this menu aren’t labeled, but they’re 
described here in left to right order:
 
• Create Memo: Write a personal note to be posted on your Wii’s 
Message Board. This is useful for leaving messages for your family 
or reminders for yourself. See the later section, “Sending Message 
Board messages,” for more on this.

Part I: The Basics 
Registering Wii Friends
Just like you need your friends’ phone numbers before you can call them 
on the phone, you need your friends’ 16-digit Wii Numbers before you can 
send them a message using the Wii. Not only that, but your friends also have 
to have your Wii Number registered in their Wii before you can talk to each 
other. This registering is done through the Wii’s Address Book, and it goes a 
little something like this:
 
1. Open the Wii Address Book by navigating to the Wii Message Board 
menu, clicking the Create Message icon, and clicking the Address 
Book icon.
 
 This brings up the Address Book, as shown in Figure 4-8.
 
2. Click Register.
 
3. Choose the type of friend you want to register.
 
 Choose Wii if you want to send messages directly to a friend’s Wii. Choose 
Others if you want to send e-mail messages to a computer or cell phone 
user.
 
4. Enter the Wii number or e-mail address.
 
 Use the on-screen keypad or keyboard to enter your friend’s Wii Number 
(for friends using a Wii) or e-mail address (for friends using a computer 
or cell phone). If your friends don’t know their Wii Number, tell them 
they can find it on the front page of their Wii Address book (use the pre-
ceding instructions if you need to walk them through how to get there). 
Click OK to continue.

Book, which

sonal Wii 
Number.
 

65
 Chapter 4: Getting the System Online
 
5. Enter a nickname for your friend.
 
 This nickname is how your friend is identified in your address book. No 
one else sees this name — it’s just a personal reminder of who this Wii 
Number or e-mail address belongs to. Nicknames can have up to ten 
characters. Click OK to continue.
 
6. Attach a Mii (optional).
 
 If you want, you can attach a Mii to each person in your address book as 
a visual reminder of who the person is. You can add a Mii later by edit-
ing the Address Book entry, as described later in this section. For more 
on Miis, see Chapter 7.
 
7. Click OK to complete the registration.
 
8. Get your friend to confirm your registration.
 
 Even though your friends’ information is now in your address book, 
you won’t be able to send them a message until they confirm that they 
actually know you. For friends using a Wii, this means they have to 
enter your Wii Number into their address books. You can find your Wii 
Number on the front page of your Address Book, as shown in Figure 4-8.
 
 When you register Wii Friends using an e-mail address, they receive a 
message in their inbox asking them to confirm that they know you. This 
message comes from an e-mail address that includes your Wii Number 
and a nintendo.com domain name. Make sure your friend receives the 
e-mail and replies to it to confirm the registration.
 
 Even after this confirmation takes place, it still might take a little while 
for Nintendo’s servers to register the connection and allow communica-
tions between you and your friends through the Wii. Be patient. When 
your friends have been confirmed, their names in your address book 
changes from a light gray to a dark black and you can send messages to 
each other, as described in the following section.
You can edit entries in your Address Book after the fact by opening the 
Address Book and finding the name you’d like to edit. As usual, you can 
scroll through the pages of the address book by clicking the arrows on the 
sides of the screen or using the + and – buttons on the Wii Remote. Clicking 
a name brings up the menu shown in Figure 4-9, from which you can send a 
message, change a nickname, or remove a person from your Address Book 
entirely.
 
You can only have 100 Wii Friends registered at one time. If you have more 
than that, you have to delete some before adding more. On a more personal 
note, can I ask how you got so incredibly popular?

Sending Message Board messages
After you have your Wii Friends registered and confirmed, you can send them 
messages directly from your Wii Message Board. Even if you don’t have any 
Wii Friends, you can still leave personal memos on your local Message Board 
for family members or as personal reminders. Follow these steps to complete 
either of these tasks:
 
1. Go to the Wii Message Board.
 
2. Enter the Send Message submenu by clicking the Create Message 
envelope icon.
 
 See Figure 4-7.
 
3. Choose to send a memo or a message.
 
 Choose the icon on the left to create a personal memo that stays on 
your local Wii Message Board. Choose the icon in the middle to create 
a message that is sent to one of your registered Wii Friends via the 
Internet.
 
4. Choose your Wii Friend (for Internet messages only).
 
 If you’re sending a message to a Wii Friend, your Address Book pops up. 
Navigate the pages by clicking the on-screen arrows or the + or – but-
tons on your Remote, and then click the name for the Wii Friend you 
want to send the message to. Note that if a name shows up in gray, it 
means that your Wii Friend hasn’t confirmed your registration yet.
 
5. Enter your text.

67
 Chapter 4: Getting the System Online
 
 Click the text area and use the on-screen keyboard to enter your mes-
sage. For more on using the on-screen keyboard, see the following 
section.
 
6. Attach a Mii (optional).
 
 If you’d like to include an identifying Mii with your message, click the Mii 
icon in the upper left and choose from among the Miis in your Mii Plaza.
 
7. Click Post.
In addition to creating posts from whole cloth, you can also reply to mes-
sages you receive in a similar fashion. Simply click Reply when reading a 
Message Board message, and then follow the preceding instructions starting 
from Step 5.
You can also use the Message Board to send digital pictures to your Wii 
Friends. (See Chapter 8 for more on how to do this.)
The on-screen keyboard
Since the Wii doesn’t have a built-in keyboard, typing in memos and mes-
sages usually means using the on-screen keyboard shown in Figure 4-10. The 
on-screen keyboard is also used to enter text into many menus.

68
Part I: The Basics 
 
If you don’t like using the on-screen keyboard, the Wii also supports any 
number of standard USB keyboards that you can plug into the USB ports on 
the back of the system. It’s a little inconvenient having a keyboard in the living 
room, but if you’re writing a lot of messages, the faster typing speed might be 
worth it.
The on-screen keyboard itself is largely self-explanatory — simply point at 
and click a letter to enter it into the message — but there are a few buttons 
and displays on the keyboard that might be a little confusing. They’re labeled 
in Figure 4-10 and described further in the following list:
 
 Predicted word area: This area can help speed up your typing on Wii 
Message Board messages and memos by predicting the whole word 
based on the first few letters. For instance, if you type in “d-u-m-m” the 
words “dummy” and “dummies” appears in this area as suggestions for 
the word you may be typing. If either of these is the word you’re going 
for, you can click on the word itself to save a few virtual keystrokes.
 
 Carriage return: Advances the text down to the next line.
 
 More: Brings up a menu with additional punctuation marks and special 
characters not shown on the keyboard.
 
 Language: Change the language used by the predicted word area. 
Choose between English, French, and Spanish.
 
 Shift: The next letter you type is uppercase. You can also use this key 
to access further punctuation and symbols on certain keys; it works just 
like the Shift key on a regular computer keyboard.
 
 Caps: Letters you type appear in uppercase until you click the Caps 
button again.
 
 Keyboard style: Click the number pad icon to switch from the QWERTY 
keyboard to one that resembles a cell phone texting keypad, as shown 
in Figure 4-11. This works a bit differently from a regular keyboard, as 
any experienced cell phone text messenger knows. You have to click 
on a specific button multiple times to cycle to your desired letter. For 
instance, clicking the button labeled “def” twice would enter the letter E, 
as it does on a cell phone. Note that if you want to enter another letter 
from the same button (a D to follow the E, for instance), first you have 
to move the pointer off the button briefly to advance the cursor. Use the 
buttons on the left to switch among the capital-, lowercase-, and num-
ber-entry modes.
 
 The predictive text area also works a little differently for the cell phone-
style keyboard: Instead of entering the first few letters of the word you 
want to type, you only have to click the applicable buttons once. For 
instance, if you want to enter the word “dummy,” you’d click the “def” 
button, the “tuv” button, then the “mno” button twice. The word shows 
up in the predictive text area, along with other words you could have 
typed using those same buttons (such as “funny” or “dunno”).

In addition to the on-screen buttons, the buttons on the Wii Remote itself can 
be used for certain shortcuts. For instance, the – button can be used to delete 
a character, and the directional pad can be used to move the cursor to a dif-
ferent point in the message (though this only works if the predictive text fea-
ture is turned off). You can also move the cursor around simply by pointing to 
the desired position in the message and pushing the A button on the Remote.

t’s pretty obvious that Nintendo’s latest system was 
influenced by the universal simplicity of the common 
TV set. Not only does the Wii have a controller that 
resembles a TV remote control, but the system’s basic 
interface also is broken into units called Channels. Just 
like their TV counterparts, each Channel has a different 
focus. Flipping through the list lets you do everything 
from downloading new games to creating cute characters 
called Miis, viewing digital photos and Web pages, and 
much more. There’s even an on-screen guide, the Wii 
Menu, that lets you jump directly to what you want. All 
this, and you don’t even need to install an antenna or 
satellite dish on your roof. Isn’t technology grand?

ost people prefer a piece of electronics with more features to a similar 
device with fewer features. Just as important in such a comparison, 
though, is how easy those features are to access and use. As any tech-head 
knows, accessing the advanced functions on some electronic devices like cell 
phones can be a baffling experience.
Luckily, the Nintendo Wii doesn’t hide its features in a confusing maze of 
menus. Instead, all the myriad functions of the Wii can be accessed from the 
Wii Menu (sometimes called the Wii Channel menu). The Wii Menu is the first 
menu you see when you turn on the system, so knowing your way around it 
is pretty important to successfully using the system. In this chapter, I show 
you how to navigate the Wii Menu to access the various Wii Channels, 
including the game-playing Disc Channel. You also find out how to organize 
the icons on the Wii Menu to your liking, as well as how to back up and clean 
out your Wii’s internal system memory.
Navigating the Wii Channel Menu
The first time you turn on the Wii, the Wii Menu looks much the way it does 
in Figure 5-1. Each colored square represents a Channel, which is a distinct 
game or application you can start with just a few clicks of the Remote. The 
grayed-out squares are empty for now, but they can be filled in with other 
Channels and games in the future.

74
Part II: The Channels 
You can set the time and date at the bottom of the Wii Menu using the 
Settings menu, as described in Chapter 2. You can also access the Wii 
Message Board by clicking the envelope icon in the bottom-right corner. 
(Using the Message Board is described in more detail in Chapter 4.)
 
Figure 5-1: 
The Wii 
Channel 
menu, full of 
Channels.
 
 
If your Wii is hooked up to the Internet, some of the Channel icons may 
be periodically updated with new information. The Wii Shop Channel, for 
instance, automatically downloads a list of the latest games and Channels 
available for download, and scrolls this list on the icon visible right there on 
the Wii Menu. You can use this information to save yourself the trouble of 
starting the Channel to see if it has been updated. Note that WiiConnect24 
service must be turned on for this feature to do its thing. See Chapter 4 for 
more on configuring the Wii to work with the Internet and WiiConnect24.
If you twist the Remote in your hand while pointing at the Wii Menu, the on-
screen pointer rotates to match its angle. Rotating the pointer isn’t good for 
anything per se, but it is fun.
Changing the Channel
Navigating the Wii Menu is a simple, point-and-click affair. Simply point the 
Wii Remote at the Sensor Bar and hover the on-screen pointer over your 

75
 Chapter 5: Wii Channel Basics
desired Channel. (See Chapter 3 for more on using the Wii Remote as a 
pointer.) The Channel is highlighted in blue and its name appears below 
the pointer. Press the A button at this point and you bring up the Channel 
Preview screen for that Channel, as shown in Figure 5-2.
 
Figure 5-2: 
The Channel 
Preview 
screen.
 
 
The Remote gives a slight rumble as you move it over the various Channels on 
the Wii Menu. (You can turn this rumbling off by using the Wii Remote Settings 
screen in the Wii’s Home menu, as described in Chapter 3.)
From the Channel Preview screen, click the Start button to start that Channel, 
or click the Wii Menu button to go back. You can also use the arrows on the 
left and right sides of the screen to jump to other Channel preview screens 
without returning to the Wii Menu (the + and – buttons on the Wii Remote 
have the same effect). Which Channel Preview comes up next in the scroll-
ing depends on the arrangement of Channels on the Wii Menu itself (see the 
“Reorganizing the Wii Menu” section, later in this chapter).
If your Wii is hooked up the Internet, some Channel Preview screens can also 
provide updated information about a Channel, much like the Wii Menu icons 
discussed previously. The Forecast Channel, for instance, can be calibrated 
to show local weather conditions and temperature on the Preview Screen, 
without the need to load the Channel itself. (See Chapter 10 for more on the 
Forecast Channel.)

76
Part II: The Channels 
Playing games with the Disc Channel
As an example of how to start Channels with the Wii Menu, this section 
describes the process for playing disc-based games on the Wii using the Disc 
Channel. Older systems let you play a game just by putting it in the system; 
Wii owners have to use the Disc Channel manually to start the game.
First, you have to put the disc in the system, as shown in Figure 5-3.
After the disc is in the system, the Disc Channel icon changes to a small pre-
view of the game (or to a GameCube logo, in the case of GameCube games). If 
the system is having problems detecting the disc, make sure it’s inserted cor-
rectly — with the shiny, blank side of the disc pointing toward the buttons 
on the face of the system. (This means the shiny side should point to the left 
if the system is standing upright, and point downward if the system is lying 
horizontally.)
When the disc is inserted correctly and detected, click the Disc Channel icon 
to bring up the preview screen. Figure 5-4 shows the preview screen as it 
looks for Wii Sports. Click the Start button and your game starts.

 Chapter 5: Wii Channel Basics
 
Even after you’ve started a game or Channel, you’re never more than a few 
button presses from returning to the Wii Menu. Just press the Home button 
on the Wii Remote to bring up the Home Menu (as shown in Figure 5-5). Then 
click the Wii Menu button to get back to your Channel list.

Part II: The Channels 
Adding new Channels
The Wii Menu might look a little barren when you first pull the system out of 
the box, but you can fill in those blank spaces in one of two ways:
 
 The Wii Shop Channel: If your Wii is hooked up to the Internet, you can 
use the Wii Shop Channel to download new games and Channels. These 
downloadable games and Channels appear automatically in an open slot 
on your Wii Menu as soon as they’ve been downloaded. Some of these 
Channels are free to download, so if you have an Internet connection, 
there’s really no reason not to start to fill up your Wii Menu. See Chapter 
6 for more on downloading games and Channels from the Wii Shop 
Channel.
 
 Install Channels from a game disc: Some games let you install a game-
specific Channel to your Wii Menu straight from the game disc. These 
Channels let you perform some of that game’s functions even if you 
don’t have the game disc in the system. (See Chapter 10 for more on 
installing and using these game-specific Channels.)
Turning the page
After you install downloadable games and Channels on your Wii, you might 
start running out of room on the 12 slots on the front page of the Wii Menu. 
Don’t fret — the Wii Menu can actually hold up to 48 Channels on its four 
pages.
To access the other pages of the Wii Menu, simply click the arrow on the 
right side of the screen, as shown in Figure 5-6. To go back to the first page, 
use the similar arrow that appear on the left side of the screen. If you don’t 
feel like pointing, you can use the + and – buttons on the Wii Remote to scroll 
quickly through the menu’s pages.
Reorganizing the Wii Menu
As your Wii Menu starts filling up, you might find that some icons aren’t 
arranged as conveniently as you might like. Maybe some Channels you use 
all the time are hiding on the back pages, while rarely used Channels are 
clogging up the front page. Maybe you want all your Virtual Console games 
to be next to each other, rather than scattered all over the place. Maybe 

79
 Chapter 5: Wii Channel Basics
you want all the Channels that require the Internet on the third page, just 
because that’s where they have the best Feng Shui. All these situations can 
be easily fixed by rearranging the Channel icons on the Wii Menu itself as 
follows:
 
 To move a Wii Menu icon to a new slot, simply hover the pointer over 
the icon you wish to move and pick it up by pressing the A and B but-
tons together. Picture this as holding the icon between your thumb and 
forefinger with a pinching grip. The pointer changes to a clenched fist 
carrying the Channel icon, as shown in Figure 5-7.
 
 To place the Channel in its new location after picking it up, simply 
move the pointer over an empty space on the Wii Menu and let go of A 
or B (the new location should be highlighted in blue before the drop). 
The Channel icon disappears from its old location and reappears in 
the new one.
 
 Note that you can’t move a Channel to a slot that already has an icon 
on it. If you want to have two icons switch places, you have to use 
an empty slot as a temporary holding space for one of them. If there 
are absolutely no empty slots on any of the Wii Menu’s four pages, 
consult the “Cleaning Out the Cobwebs: Wii Memory Management” 
section for information on how to clear some space for your 
reorganizing.

 To move a Channel to an open slot on a different page, simply pick it 
up as normal then hover over the page-turning arrow (refer to Figure 
5-4). The Wii Menu scrolls to the next page, allowing you to place the 
icon where you want it.
 
One Channel can’t be moved using the methods discussed here: The Disc 
Channel. This game-playing Channel is so important that it’s impossible 
to move away from the upper-left corner of the Wii Menu’s front page. 
This is probably for the best — after all, do you really want to go search-
ing through the Wii Menu every time you want to play a disc-based 
game?
Cleaning Out the Cobwebs: 
Wii Memory Management
Those icons on your Wii Menu don’t just represent downloaded games and 
Channels — they also represent files stored in the 1,840 or so “blocks” of 
internal system memory on the Wii. This internal memory is where every-
thing that makes your Wii unique is stored — from the Channels on the Wii 
Menu to the saved game data that keeps track of your in-game progress to 
the messages stored on the Wii Message Board.

81
 Chapter 5: Wii Channel Basics
For the most part, you don’t have to concern yourself with the arrange-
ment and management of this internal memory — the Wii handles all your 
files automatically. In a few situations, though, you may want to back up, 
delete, or move files out of the Wii’s internal memory. The following sections 
describe how to handle these situations.
Backing up files
If you’ve ever lost a term paper at 11:30 p.m. the night before it was due 
because your computer crashed, you know how important it can be to back 
up files on your computer. But not many people think of how important it is 
to back up the files on their game systems. Aren’t the 40 hours you’ve put 
into The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess just as important as the 40 hours 
you put into that term paper?
Files stored on the Wii’s Internal Memory — including game saves, Channels, 
and games downloaded from the Wii Shop Channel — can be backed up to a 
SmartDigital (SD) card by following these steps:
 
1. Insert an SD card with some free space into the slot on the front of the 
system.
 
 More details on how to do this can be found in Chapter 8.
 
2. Go to the Wii Menu and click the Wii icon in the lower-left corner 
(refer to Figure 5-1).
 
3. Click Data Management.
 
4. To back up Channels or downloaded games, click Channels. To back 
up saved game progress, click Save Data, and then click Wii.
 
 At this point, you see a grid view showing all the files you’ve requested 
represented as icons, as shown in Figure 5-8. Hovering the pointer 
over an icon on this menu gives you the name of the file. Note that this 
screen also displays how many of the roughly 1,840 blocks of free space 
are left on the system’s internal memory. As this number gets lower and 
lower, the need to back up and delete unneeded data becomes more 
urgent.
 
5. Click the icon for the file you want to back up.
 
 This brings up a menu screen asking whether you want to copy or erase 
the file. Note that this screen also tells you how many of the Wii’s 1,840 
blocks of memory are being used by the file you’ve selected. This 

82
Part II: The Channels 
information can be handy when you’re choosing which files to erase 
when pruning your Wii’s memory banks. (See the following section, 
“Deleting data”).
 
Figure 5-8: 
A grid view 
of the Wii 
save data.
 
 
 Data for some games, such as Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros. Brawl, is 
protected and can’t be copied to an SD card. A message saying that this 
file can’t be copied pops up for these games. Unfortunately, there is no 
way to back up this data.
 
6. Click Copy, and then click Yes when asked for confirmation.
 
 The Wii begins to copy the selected file to the SD card. (The data-
copying process may take a few minutes, so be patient.)
 
 Do not remove the SD card or turn off the system during the copying 
process, because this might corrupt the data and make the entire SD 
card unusable.
 
You can only have one copy of a certain file saved on an SD card at any one 
time. If you already have a copy of that file on the SD card, the Wii won’t let 
you make the new copy. You have to remove the old file from the SD card 
before copying the new data over (see the later section, “Restoring files,” for

 Chapter 5: Wii Channel Basics
Deleting data
After a file has been backed up on an SD card, that file can be safely deleted 
from the Wii’s internal memory.
 
You can also delete files that haven’t been backed up, but be warned: There’s 
no way to recover these files later.
The process for deleting files from the Wii’s system memory is very similar to 
the process for backing up the files:
 
1. Repeat steps 1 through 5 in the “Backing up files” section.
 
2. Click Erase, and then click Yes when asked for confirmation.
 
 Before you do this, make sure you’ve either backed up the file or that 
you’re really, really sure you want to get rid of this file permanently. 
After you click Yes, the file is gone. There’s no getting it back. Channels 
and downloaded games deleted in this manner disappear from the Wii 
Menu, although they can be downloaded again through the Wii Shop 
Channel at any time. Games with saved data deleted in this way have to 
be restarted from the beginning.
Restoring files
Having a file backed up on an SD card is all well and good, but it doesn’t 
really do anyone any good just sitting all alone on that card. To actually use 
the file again, it has to first be restored onto the system’s internal memory. 
It’s a relatively simple process that’s performed like this:
 
1. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 of the “Backing up files” section earlier in 
this chapter.
 
2. Click the SD Card tab at the upper-right corner of the screen.
 
 This brings up a list of all the Wii files you’ve copied onto the SD card. 
Notice that the amount of free space on the SD card is shown in the 
Blocks Open area at lower right.
 
3. Click the icon for the file you want to copy to the Wii System.
 
4. Click Copy, and then click Yes when asked for confirmation.
 
 The file is copied from the SD card back to the Wii System Memory. Note 
that you can only have one copy of a particular file on your system at 
any time. If a copy of the backed up file is already on the system, the Wii 
tells you that “this data already exists in the Wii System Memory.” You 
have to delete the older version from the Wii system memory before you 
can copy the desired data from the SD card.

84
Part II: The Channels 
Note that if you want to free up some space on your SD card for some reason, 
you can delete files from the SD card in much the same fashion. Simply 
complete Steps 1 through 3 as above, and then click the Erase option instead 
of Copy.
 
Remember that clicking Erase removes the file from the SD card permanently, 
so be careful if you’re toying around with your only backup.
Moving files to another Wii
The SD card isn’t just handy for backing up personal files on your Wii; it’s 
also the only way to transfer files from one Wii to another. The process for 
moving files from one system to another is exactly the same as that outlined 
in the earlier sections, “Backing up files” and “Restoring files,” only in this 
case you’re restoring the files to a system other than the one you backed 
them up from. This is a great way to share saved game data with friends who 
might not be as amazingly awesome at a certain game as you are.
 
Wii Channels and games downloaded from the Wii Shop Channel can’t be 
transferred from system to system in this manner. These Channels and games 
are tied to the system they’re first downloaded to — meaning they won’t work 
on any other system. If you want to share a new Channel or downloaded game, 
you have to take your entire Wii system over to your friend’s house. No biggie. 
The system is pretty portable, after all.
Handling GameCube data
GameCube saved data can’t be copied to an SD card or to the Wii system 
memory, but it can be copied between GameCube memory cards, using the 
two GameCube card slots located on the top of the system (see Chapter 
2 for more on this feature). This backup process is similar to the method 
described earlier in this chapter:
 
1. Make sure there are GameCube memory cards in both card slots.
 
2. Go to the Data Management screen (as described in Steps 1–3 in the 
earlier section, “Backing up files”).
 
3. Choose Save Data, and then GameCube.
 
 This brings up the GameCube Save Data menu, as shown in Figure 5-9. 
Note the tab at the top of the screen that allows you to toggle the view 
between Slot A and Slot B.

85
 Chapter 5: Wii Channel Basics
 
4. Select the data you want to copy, and then choose Copy to copy it 
over to the other card. Or you can simply choose Erase to erase the 
data from the card completely.

The Wii Shop Channel
In This Chapter
 Downloading games and new Wii Channels using the Wii Shop Channel
 Converting your hard-earned money into Nintendo’s Wii Shop Points currency
 Playing classic games using the Wii’s Virtual Console
 Figuring out which controller works with which Virtual Console game
T
here are two ways to get software for your Wii. The first involves getting 
up, getting in your car, driving to the store, finding a game on the shelf, 
waiting in line, purchasing (or renting) the game, getting back in the car, 
driving home, opening the case, putting the game in the system, and playing.
The second involves sitting on your couch, using the Wii Remote and an 
on-screen menu to download the game, and playing.
Which method sounds better to you?
Not surprisingly, many Wii owners are thrilled with the Wii Shop Channel, 
which lets them download new and classic games directly to their Wii 
consoles from the comfort of the couch. While the games on the Shop 
Channel tend to be older and/or less technically advanced than their disc-
based brethren, they can be just as much fun and, just as importantly, a lot 
cheaper.
What’s more, the Wii Shop Channel also lets Wii owners download fun and 
functional Channels to increase the versatility of their systems. Many of these 
Channels are offered for free, meaning there’s really no reason not to take 
advantage of them. This chapter tells you how to download and use these 
games and channels.

88
Part II: The Channels 
Setting Things Up
Before you get going with the Wii Shop Channel, make sure that your Wii 
is connected to the Internet (see Chapter 4 for instructions if your Wii isn’t 
online yet).
Fire up the Wii Menu and click the Wii Shop Channel. If your Internet 
connection is set up correctly, you get a white screen with the Wii logo and 
a rotating blue circle to indicate that the Channel is loading. The loading 
process can take anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes, depending 
on your connection speed, so be patient. Eventually, you see the Wii Shop 
Channel’s main menu, as shown in Figure 6-1.
 
Figure 6-1: 
The Wii 
Shop 
Channel 
main menu.
 
Clicking one of the game names at the top of this menu brings up the informa-
tion page for that game. Clicking one of the headlines under Important Info 
brings up the details of the announcement. (You can scroll through these 
news stories using the up and down arrows on the Wii Remote’s directional 
pad.) The specific games and headlines shown on this page change from 
week to week, generally updating every Monday.
After browsing the new games and headlines to your heart’s content, click 
Start Shopping to dive right into the Wii’s full catalog of downloadable games 
and Channels, as described in the following section.

89
 Chapter 6: The Wii Shop Channel
 
When browsing the Wii Shop Channel, don’t be alarmed if the page doesn’t 
change immediately as soon as you click a button. After you click your 
selection, there may be a few seconds’ pause while the Wii downloads the 
requested data from the Nintendo servers. You can make sure the Wii is still 
working by looking for a rotating gray circle in the upper-left corner of the 
screen. If the gray circle stops spinning (or if it remains spinning for a full 
minute or more), restart the system, check your Internet connection setup, 
and try again.
Browsing the Virtual Aisles
After you click the Start Shopping button, you see the Shopping menu 
shown in Figure 6-2. Consider this the main hallway in a virtual mall filled 
with downloadable content for your Wii. This hallway has a lot of potential 
doors to go through, and what’s behind each one is explained in the 
following list:
 
Figure 6-2: 
The Wii

Channels 
Shopping 
menu.
 
 
 Virtual Console: Browse, purchase, and download games originally 
designed for classic video-game systems, now downloadable and 
playable on the Wii.
 
 WiiWare: Browse, purchase, and download original software created 
specifically for the Wii.
 
 Wii Channels: Browse, purchase, and download fun and functional non-
game applications for the Wii.

 Add Wii Points: Purchase Wii Points, the currency used to purchase 
games and Channels through the Wii Shop Channel.
 
 Account Activity: View a summary of your Wii Point and download 
activity, as shown in Figure 6-3. This menu provides a good way to 
monitor your account to keep track of the Wii Shop Channel purchases 
you and your family have been making. Scroll through the pages of the 
list using the blue arrows on the bottom right, or click on a Channel or 
game name to view details about that Channel or game purchase. Click 
Back to return to the Shopping menu.
 
Figure 6-3:

 Titles You’ve Downloaded: View a list of all the games and Channels 
you’ve downloaded so far. This is handy if you have to download a title 
that you purchased but had to delete for some reason, or just as a simple 
way to keep track of all the games and Channels you’ve purchased so far. 
Use the arrows to scroll and change pages, or click on a game or Channel 
name to go to the information page for that title. Click Back to return to 
the Shopping menu.
 
 Settings: Adjust the following settings specific to the Wii Shop Channel:
 
• My Nintendo Membership Settings: If you’ve signed up for a My 
Nintendo account on Nintendo.com, you can use this option to link 
your Wii Shop Channel account and your My Nintendo account 
together. Linking the accounts adds your Wii Shop Channel 
purchases automatically to the list of Wii games stored on your My 
Nintendo account. If you don’t have a My Nintendo account, you 
can sign up for one for free by visiting http://my.nintendo.
com/cpp/mynintendo/myNintendo.do.

91
 Chapter 6: The Wii Shop Channel
 
 To link the accounts, click the username and password fields 
on this submenu and use the on-screen keyboard to enter your 
personal data. Remember that your password is case-sensitive, 
so use those Shift and Caps Lock keys if necessary. Then click 
the Link button to confirm. You can unlink the accounts later 
by choosing the My Nintendo Membership Settings option again 
and then clicking Unlink. You can link and unlink your account as 
many times as you want.
 
• Gift Settings: If, for some reason, you don’t like receiving down-
loadable games and Channels as gifts from your Wii Friends, you 
can turn off your system’s ability to receive gifts by using this 
menu option. Doing so automatically refuses any and all such gifts 
your Wii Friends try to send you. (You can turn on the gift-receipt 
feature later by using the same menu option. Before you do, 
though, could you possibly tell your friends to send all those gifts 
to me instead?)
 
• Remove Wii Shop Channel: Be careful! This menu option removes 
your Wii Shop Channel account and deletes all the software you’ve 
already downloaded from your system. The only reason you might 
want to do this is if you’re selling your Wii and you don’t want your 
personal data to be accessible to the system’s new owner. Short of 
that, just stay far, far away from this option.
 
 Wii Menu: Return to the Wii Menu, shockingly enough!
 
 Wii Points: This area displays your current balance of Wii Points. Click 
this number to add Wii Points to your account.
 
 Shopping Guide: This option opens up an interactive guide that tells 
you how to use the Wii Shop Channel. (You won’t be needing it, though, 
because you have this book, right? Right?! Right.)
Turning Dollars into Wii Shop Points
In a real store, you can exchange crisp bills and shiny coins or plastic for 
goods and services. Because the Wii doesn’t have slots for bills, coins, or 
credit cards, you need another way to purchase games and Channels from 
the Wii Shop Channel. This means converting your hard-earned legal tender 
into the Wii Shop Channel’s exclusive currency, Wii Shop Points.
 
Do not put bills, coins, or credit cards into the Wii’s disc slot. This advice may 
seem obvious, but you’d be surprised what some people will try.

92
Part II: The Channels 
Wii Shop Channel game pricing
Before purchasing your Wii Shop Points (sometimes referred to as Wii Points), 
it would probably be good to know how many you need for the specific game 
or Channel you want. This information is displayed prominently next to each 
game and Channel name as you browse the selection on the Wii Shop Channel 
(see “Browsing, Purchasing, and Downloading” later in this chapter).
In general, original WiiWare games can vary in price anywhere from 500 to 
1,500 Wii Shop Points (that is, $5 to $15). The downloadable Channels 
available as of this writing are generally free, with one exception: The 
Internet Channel, which costs 500 points ($5). Interestingly enough, even 
the Internet Channel was free until June 30, 2007, when Nintendo took the 
Channel out of beta testing and upped the price. (Sorry, late adopters; you 
have to shell out a Lincoln for Web browsing on your TV.)
For classic games available on the Wii Virtual Console, pricing is largely 
dependent on the system the game was originally released for. This pricing 
system is detailed in Table 6-1. Some rare and/or foreign games might be 
priced slightly higher than the prevailing rates listed in Table 6-1, but the 
prices apply to the vast majority of the Virtual Console games available on 
the Wii Shop Channel. (Whether each game is worth the price is a matter of 
personal discretion, of course.) See Chapter 15 for a list of some games that 
are definitely worth the money, in my humble opinion.

Purchasing Wii Shop Points
When you know what game or Channel you want to buy and how much it 
costs, you need to actually convert your money into the Wii Shop Points 
necessary to get it. To do this, simply click the Wii Points button that appears 
at the bottom of nearly every screen of the Wii Shop Channel. (Refer to Figure 
6-2.) Doing this brings up the Add Wii Points menu, shown in Figure 6-4.

93
 Chapter 6: The Wii Shop Channel
 
Figure 6-4: 
The Add 
Wii Points 
menu.
 
Adding Wii Points by Wii Points Card
As you can see, there are two main ways to add Wii Points to your Wii Shop 
Channel account. The first is by redeeming a Wii Points Card, a prepaid plastic 
card sold at most electronics and gaming retailers (and shown in Figure 6-5).
 
Figure 6-5: 
The Wii 
Points Card.
 

94
Part II: The Channels 
Wii Points Cards currently come only in denominations of 2,000 points; these 
sell for roughly $20 in the U.S. (You can occasionally find slightly better deals 
as part of store promotions or bundles.) While purchasing a prepaid card 
from a brick-and-mortar store largely ruins the convenience of shopping from 
the comfort of your couch, these cards are the only way for people who don’t 
have major credit cards to get Wii Points into their account. Wii Points Cards 
also make good gifts for your Wii-owning friends, although savvy Wii owners 
can use the Shop Channel’s gift-giving function to subvert even this need to 
leave the couch. (See the later section, “Gift-giving.”)
After you get home with your Wii Points Card, here’s the drill:
 
1. Scratch off the silver foil on the back using a coin or a key to reveal 
the Wii Point Card Activation Number.
 
2. Click Redeem Wii Points Card on the Add Wii Points menu shown in 
Figure 6-4, and enter this number using the on-screen keypad.
 
 Make sure you enter all 16 digits correctly or the Wii won’t recognize the 
card.
 
3. Click OK, and your Wii account is credited with the requisite number 
of Wii Points.
 
 You can now discard the card, or keep it as a stylish reminder of your 
Wii Points purchase.
Adding Wii Points by credit card
By far the more convenient and flexible way to add Wii Points to your 
account is to use a major credit card. To do this, click the Buy Wii Points 
with a Credit Card button on the Add Wii Points menu (refer to Figure 6-4). 
Then follow these steps:
 
1. Choose the number of Wii Points you want.
 
 Wii Points are available in increments of 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, or 5,000 (if you 
really just want 4,000 Points, you can buy two 2,000-Point increments). 
Refer to the “Wii Shop Channel game pricing” section to figure out how 
many points you actually need. Don’t worry if it looks like you’re going to 
end up with leftover points — they’re saved in your account for your next 
purchase (see “The surplus Points problem” sidebar).
 
2. Choose your credit card type.
 
 Only Visa and MasterCard are currently accepted. Wii owners with 
other credit cards need to go out and purchase a Wii Points Card. Sorry, 
Diner’s Club members.
 
3. Enter your credit card number, expiration date, and security code.
 
 Use the on-screen keypads and arrows to enter your personal data. Your 
security code is a numeric code found on the back of your card, usually in 
the signature area. You only need to enter the last three digits of this code.

95
 Chapter 6: The Wii Shop Channel
 
 
Don’t worry too much about the security of your personal credit card 
data when you’re using the Wii Shop Channel. The Wii automatically 
encrypts all the sensitive data it sends to Nintendo, so unscrupulous 
characters listening in won’t be able to make sense of your information 
even if they somehow intercept it. While no security system is perfect, 
this is relatively safe as these things go. If you really want some extra 
protection, look into a wireless router with WEP or WPA security.
 
4. Enter your billing address information.
 
 Use the on-screen keyboard to enter the required information.
 
 Note that the last field is County, not Country (this little wrinkle messed 
up quite a few transactions for me).
The surplus Points problem
By now, you may have noticed that the pricing 
of some Virtual Console and WiiWare games 
doesn’t line up very nicely with the sales 
increments for Wii Points themselves. Buying 
1,000 Wii Shop Points and then purchasing a 
900-point Neo-Geo game (for instance) leaves 
your account with 100 leftover Points. With the 
cheapest downloadable games coming in at 
500 Wii Points, the questions quickly become: 
What am I supposed to do with these leftover 
points? And why can’t I buy just the Wii Points 
I need?
Unfortunately, there’s no wholly satisfying 
answer to either of these perfectly fine 
questions. The best defense I’ve heard for 
Nintendo’s 1,000-Point-at-a-time sales practice 
has to do with the credit card fees associated 
with purchasing Wii Points online. Selling 
points in smaller increments, the argument 
goes, would bury Nintendo in credit card fees 
that it can’t really afford. (Note that this defense 
did not come from Nintendo itself, but from a 
business-savvy friend of mine.)
While this explanation is plausible, conspiracy-
minded readers have probably come up with an 
equally plausible explanation for the practice: 
Nintendo is trying to bilk Wii owners out of 
their hard-earned dough. After all, if those left-
over points don’t get spent, they represent, in 
essence, extra, unearned money in Nintendo’s 
pockets. And if you do want to use these leftover 
Points, you have to buy at least 1,000 more Wii 
Points, which puts more money in Nintendo’s 
coffers. Even after the extra purchase, you often 
still have more leftover Points, which leaves 
more unearned money in Nintendo’s pockets. 
And the cycle continues.
This problem really isn’t as bad as some people 
might make it out to be. You can usually get your 
Wii Points balance down to that magic level of 
zero through some creative game-purchasing 
combinations. And frankly, if you can’t find 
enough games to justify spending $10 more on 
Wii Shop Channel content, then you aren’t look-
ing hard enough. (Check out Chapter 15 if you’re 
really having trouble.) Still, it is really annoying 
being forced to purchase Wii Shop Points that 
you may never actually use. You may just have 
to suck it up and eat the remainder, just as you 
do when buying incompatible packages of hot 
dogs and hot dog buns. Of course, the extra 
buns do tend to taste better than the extra Wii 
Shop Points.

96

5. Click Yes to confirm your purchase.
 
 After a short confirmation process, your credit card is billed and the Wii 
Points are added to your account. You can now continue shopping with 
your virtual wallet filled.
Browsing, Purchasing, and Downloading
After your virtual wallet has been virtually stuffed with virtual currency in the 
form of Wii Points, it’s time to spend those Points on Virtual Console games 
and Channels for your, er, non-virtual Wii.
Browsing
To browse the Shop Channel’s selections, go to the Shopping menu (refer to 
Figure 6-2) and choose either the Virtual Console, WiiWare, or Wii Channels 
option. The difference between the content available behind each of these 
options is described in the earlier section, “Browsing the Virtual Aisles.”
While choosing the Wii Channels option brings you directly to a scrollable 
menu of downloadable Channels (much like the one shown in Figure 6-7), 
choosing either WiiWare or Virtual Console brings up a submenu like the one 
shown in Figure 6-6, which shows the browsing submenu for WiiWare titles; 
the menu for Virtual Console titles is very similar.
 
Figure 6-6: 
WiiWare

97
 Chapter 6: The Wii Shop Channel
The WiiWare and Virtual Console browsing options menus both include the 
following options:
 
 Popular Titles: Choose this option to browse a list of the games down-
loaded most often by other Wii owners. This option is useful if you have 
no idea what you’re looking for — after all, millions of other Wii owners 
can’t be wrong (about games, anyway).
 
 Newest Additions: Choose this option to browse a list of all available 
games in reverse chronological order, based on the date they were 
added to the Wii Shop Channel. This option is particularly useful for 
seeing what’s been added since your last visit to the Channel.
 
 Search by Publisher/Genre: Choosing these options brings up yet 
another submenu where you can choose to restrict your browsing to a 
particular publisher or genre. (See Chapter 11 for advice on genres and 
how to choose games you might enjoy.)
 
 In the case of the Virtual Console menu, these options are hidden behind 
the Search by Category option. They are also joined by a third filtering 
option — Search by System — which lets you restrict your browsing to 
games originally released on a specific classic system.
 
 Search by Game Title: Enter a full or partial game title using the on-
screen keyboard, and then click OK to browse a list of games that have 
that phrase as part of their title. Remember that spelling does count 
here, so only enter part of the game title if you’re unsure of how to spell 
the whole thing.
After choosing your browsing options (as described in the preceding list), 
you’re presented with a list of games much like the one shown in Figure 6-7.

98
Part II: The Channels 
Click the arrows and slider on the right side to scroll through this list, or 
use the up and down arrows on the Wii Remote’s control pad. Browsing is 
limited to only ten games per page, so use the blue arrows in the lower-right 
corner to scroll through multiple pages of results (the current page and total 
number of pages can also be seen in the lower right). Click the Back button to 
go back to the previous menu. You can also click the question mark for help 
with navigating, or you can keep reading and I’ll prove to you that I can help 
you out just as well as any silly on-screen help files.
If you see a game that you’re potentially interested in, click its name on the 
browsing list to bring up an information page, as shown in Figure 6-8. As you 
can see, this page presents a wide variety of data about the game, including the 
original release date, publisher, genre, number of players, and ESRB rating. 
(See Chapter 11 for more on game ratings.) Click the More Details button to 
view some sample screenshots from the game and read a short synopsis of 
the gameplay.
 
Although the Wii doesn’t offer demos of WiiWare and Virtual Console games, 
you can view sample videos of generic gameplay by visiting www.nintendo.
com/wii/virtualconsole. You can also view videos of many WiiWare and 
Virtual Console games directly on your TV using the downloadable Nintendo 
Channel. (See Chapter 10 for more on this Channel.) Incidentally, you should 
definitely feel comfortable buying Super Mario 64, the game shown in Figure 
6-8, without consulting any videos, because it’s the greatest game of all time. 
And I’m totally objective about that. Honest.

 Chapter 6: The Wii Shop Channel
Purchasing and downloading
After you’ve read all the information about a game and/or Channel and are 
sure you want to actually purchase it, click the Download button at the 
bottom of the screen (as shown in Figure 6-8). Make sure you already have 
enough Wii Points attached to your account to make the purchase — if you 
don’t, the Wii greets you with a rather rude error message.
If you do have enough Wii Points, you’re taken to a list of the controllers 
that the game or Channel is compatible with. Pay close attention to this 
information before moving on, as it would be a shame to go to all the 
trouble of downloading a game or Channel just to find that you didn’t have 
the right controller to use it. For more information about which controllers 
work with which games, see the “Which controller do I need?” section later 
in this chapter, or refer to Chapter 3.
After you confirm that you have one of the compatible controllers, you’re 
presented with a download-confirmation page (shown in Figure 6-9), which 
outlines the effects the download will have on your Wii Points balance and on 
your Wii’s internal-memory situation. (See Chapter 5 for more on managing 
the Wii’s internal memory.)
 
Figure 6-9:

If this all looks acceptable, click Yes to begin the download. An old-school, 
two-dimensional Mario runs down the screen collecting coins and bashing 
blocks (as shown in Figure 6-10). This may just seem like a cute animation, 
but those blocks and coins actually represent the progress of the download.

For some downloads, you may notice the Mario on the download progress screen 
is taller and wears white overalls. When this happens, you can press the A button 
on the Wii Remote during the download to make Mario shoot fireballs. Neat!
After Mario finishes bashing the rightmost block, the Wii tells you that the 
download is complete, and updates you on the number of blocks left on the 
Wii’s internal memory. Click OK and read a quick parental-control warning, 
and then press A to return to the Wii Shop channel.
When you return to the Wii Menu, your newly downloaded game or Channel 
is ready to go, with no need for any manual installation.
 
You may have to scroll past the first page of the Wii Menu to find your new 
download.
Gift-giving
In addition to downloading games and Channels for your own personal use, the 
Wii Shop Channel also lets you purchase titles as gifts for your registered Wii 
Friends. The process for purchasing these gifts is very similar to the process 
for downloading your own titles — just click the Gift button on the game 
information page instead of the Purchase button (refer to Figure 6-8). After 
reading the controller information page, you’re asked to pick the recipient of 
your gift from a list of your registered Wii friends (see Chapter 4 for more on 
registering Wii Friends).

101
 Chapter 6: The Wii Shop Channel
After choosing your friend, you’re allowed to write a personal message and 
attach a Mii to your gift, as shown in Figure 6-11. The process for writing 
this note is similar to the process for writing a Wii Message Board message 
(described in Chapter 4).
 
Figure 6-11: 
The Wii

After you confirm your message and the gift purchase, the Wii Points are 
deducted from your account and your gift are sent across the Internet. Your 
friend receives the gift in the form of a Message on his or her Wii Message 
Board that includes a button. Your friend clicks this button to download 
the gift from the Wii Shop Channel for free. Be sure to alert any such lucky 
friends to your philanthropy; have them check their systems.
Playing Downloaded Games
Playing WiiWare and Virtual Console games downloaded from the Wii Shop 
Channel is a lot like playing Wii games that come on a disc, only there’s no 
disc! Simply click the appropriate icon on the Wii Menu and click Start to load 
the game right up. (See Chapter 5 for more in the Wii Menu.)
The following sections discuss the few other wrinkles with playing downloaded 
games that don’t apply to normal, disc-based games.

Part II: The Channels 
Which controller do I need?
Classic games downloaded for the Wii Virtual Console are identical to the 
original versions in nearly every respect. But there is one important way 
in which they differ: the controllers. Unfortunately, the Wii doesn’t let you 
plug in the original controllers used with the classic systems that the Virtual 
Console games were originally designed for.
Fortunately, many Virtual Console games are playable with the Wii Remote 
that’s included with each system. Some downloaded games, though, require 
you to use a Wii Classic Controller or GameCube controller. Which games 
work with which controllers can be a bit confusing for Virtual Console games. 
Consult Table 6-2 to determine what controller is needed for which game, 
based on the system the game was originally released for.

As you can see from Table 6-2, you can control every game in the Virtual 
Console Library with the Wii Classic Controller. If you don’t have one, though, 
a GameCube controller can act as a decent substitute, working with all games 
save some designed for the TurboGrafx-16, according to Nintendo’s Web site. 
(As this book was written, though, all 49 TurboGrafx-16 games offered on the 
Wii Shop Channel actually do work with the GameCube controller. Frankly, I 
can’t see any reason why future games would break this trend.)

103
 Chapter 6: The Wii Shop Channel
If you just have a Wii Remote, you won’t be able to play a large chunk of 
the Wii’s Virtual Console library. This is due to the distinct lack of buttons 
and joysticks on the Wii Remote, which makes controlling Super NES and 
Nintendo 64 games with the motion-sensitive controller impossible. Note that 
some Genesis and Neo-Geo games work with the Wii Remote, although this 
compatibility varies from game to game.
 
If you only have a Wii Remote, pay close attention to the controller-
compatibility confirmation screen when you’re downloading games 
originally designed for these systems; make sure you’re actually able to 
play your purchase.
Suspending play
With most games, if you haven’t saved your progress before you turn the 
system off, you’ve lost all your hard work (or hard play, as the case may be). 
With many Virtual Console games, though, this isn’t true. The Virtual Console 
has a game suspension feature that lets you automatically save your progress 
at any point in many games.
Suspending a game couldn’t be simpler. When you’re done with a play 
session, simply press the Home button on the Wii Remote and choose to 
return to the Wii Menu. The Wii automatically creates and saves a suspend 
state for the game that captures the in-game situation exactly as it was when 
you pressed the Home button. When you come back to the game, the game 
resumes from this exact point as if you had never stopped playing.
 
Note that this suspension feature doesn’t work for games that were originally 
designed for the Nintendo 64 or the Neo-Geo, owing to technical issues. Also 
note that you have to actively return to the Wii Menu to create a suspend 
state — simply turning the system off in the middle of a Virtual Console game 
erases your progress, forcing you to start over from the beginning the next 
time you play. Suspending play doesn’t work at all for downloaded WiiWare 
titles.
Also note that resuming play from a suspend state destroys that suspend 
state. This means that you have to create another suspend state before you 
end your next play session to continue your game again.
Aside from the suspend function, many Virtual Console games include a built-in 
save function to chronicle progress in the game. If the original version of a game 
originally supported saving game data, then the Virtual Console version does 
too. Saving a Virtual Console game using an in-game menu creates a save file in 
the Wii’s internal memory, just as it would for a disc-based game.

104
Part II: The Channels 
Operations Guide
All downloadable Virtual Console and WiiWare games also come with an 
in-game Operations Guide that tells you the rules and controls behind the 
game. To access the guide, press the Home button on the Wii Remote at any 
point during play, and then click the Operations Guide button on the Home 
menu.
Click the section names to open them up for reading on-screen. You can 
scroll through the various sections using the up and down buttons on the Wii 
Remote’s directional pad. The + button returns to the table of contents. Press 
the Home button again to return to the game.
The Operations Guide is especially useful for determining how the buttons on 
the various Wii controllers relate to the original buttons used in downloaded 
Virtual Console games. Each Operations Guide has a handy diagram for this, 
as well as a detailed explanation of what each button does. Read it, use it, live 
it — but most of all, play it.

Those Marvelous Miis
In This Chapter
 Making and viewing Miis with the Mii Channel
 Organizing and sharing Miis in the Mii Plaza
 Checking out Miis from other Wii users on the Check Mii Out Channel
F
or years, playing video games primarily meant taking control of 
someone else (someone virtual, anyway), and escaping your normal, 
boring life to become a super-powered alter-ego. As games have become 
more complex and game systems have become more powerful, more game 
makers are letting players create controllable, “realistic” digital versions of 
themselves, their friends, or anyone at all. The Wii is no different, allowing 
players to create customized Miis to represent themselves in games and 
Channels and the Wii Message Board.
No one is going to mistake these cartoon-like, large-eyed, round-headed Mii 
characters for digital photographs, but Miis still do a good job of capturing 
the essence of a wide variety of facial characteristics. This chapter discusses 
how to create and download Miis using the Mii Channel and share those Miis 
with the world, using the Check Mii Out Channel.
The Mii Channel and You
The Mii Channel is your main gateway for creating new Miis to use in games 
and Channels. It’s also the place where your created Miis hang out in the Mii 
Plaza when they’re not being used, and the home of the Mii Parade, where your 
friends’ Miis might wander over to you through your Internet connection.
Creating a Mii
The first time you start up the Mii Channel (see Chapter 5 for more on using 
Channels from the Wii Menu), you’re immediately asked to create a Mii. After 
that, you can create additional Miis by clicking the Create Mii button on the 
Wii Plaza menu (see the later section, “Mii Plaza”).

106
Part II: The Channels 
First you have to select the gender of your Mii by clicking the appropriate 
on-screen option (don’t worry, you can change it later). If this is your first 
Mii, you have to start with an extremely generic Mii model. If this is not your 
first Mii, you can choose to start from scratch or use the Choose a Look-Alike 
screen to pick a Mii that’s already close to the Mii you envision in your head. 
If you choose to use a look-alike, you’re first asked to choose a starting face 
from a variety of randomly generated faces. You can then tweak that face 
toward the one you envision, using the look-alike menu shown in Figure 7-1. 
Simply click the face closest to your desired Mii to see a new selection of Miis 
that tweak that Mii just slightly. Click Use This Face to start editing that face 
to your precise specifications, as described in the following section.
 
Figure 7-1: 
The Mii 
Channel’s 
look-alike 
menu.
 
Editing your Mii’s facial features
After you’ve set up your Mii’s basics, it’s time to shape your Wii’s face like 
a virtual plastic surgeon. This is done primarily through the facial editing 
menu, as shown in Figure 7-2. There are a lot of options available here, and 
even more are available by clicking the tabs on the top.
 
Click the Mii shown on the left side of the editor to make it spin around 
quickly. Click the Mii again while spinning to stop the spin and hold position. 
This is the only way to see the back of a Mii’s hairstyle, as well as a side view 
of certain facial features.

The following list describes the Mii editing options you can access by clicking 
the tabs at the top of the Mii editing menu; the tabs are described from left to 
right:
 
 Edit Mii Profile: Click this tab to configure the vital statistics for your 
Mii, as shown in Figure 7-3:

108
Part II: The Channels 
 
• Nickname: Click this area to bring up an on-screen keyboard which 
you can use to enter a nickname for your Mii. (See Chapter 5 for 
more on using the on-screen keyboard.) Note that nicknames can 
have a maximum of ten characters. This is the only personal infor-
mation that is absolutely required for every Mii — everything else 
on the Edit Mii Profile menu screen is optional.
 
• Favorite?: Check this option to designate this Mii as one of your 
favorites. These Miis tend to show up more often in the crowd 
scenes of Mii-compatible games. If you created the favored Mii, its 
pants change from blue to red in the Mii Plaza as well.
 
• Gender: Toggle your Mii’s gender between male and female. The 
only real difference between the two is that female Miis wear a 
slightly longer, tapered blouse rather than a plain shirt.
 
• Birthday: Designate a birthday for this Mii, first by choosing the 
month and then the day. You can choose today’s date or what-
ever you want. Choose the question mark to leave the birthday as 
unknown.
 
• Favorite Color: Despite the name, all this option really does is 
change the color of the Mii’s shirt. Click whichever colored square 
you’d like to choose that color.
 
• Mingle: Toggle whether or not this Mii can travel to your friends’ 
Wiis as part of the Mii Parade feature (see “The Mii Parade” sec-
tion, later in this chapter). By default, your Miis are not shared 
with others. Click this box to allow a copy of the Mii to travel to 
your Registered Wii Friends (see Chapter 4 for more on registering 
Wii Friends). Note that for this feature to work, both you and your 
friends must allow for sharing through the Mii Parade.
 
• Mii Creator: Like an artist signing a canvas, you can put your name 
(or a pseudonym) to your Mii creations. Click this button and then 
click Reenter to bring up an on-screen keyboard to enter a name 
with up to ten characters. You can also choose from a list of 
creator names that have already been entered without going 
through the keyboard.
 
 Body Type: Choose this tab on the top of the Mii editing menu to bring 
up the body type sliders shown in Figure 7-4. Click and drag the sliders 
with the Wii Remote pointer to adjust the height and weight of your Mii. 
As you move the sliders, the Mii shown on the left side of the screen 
changes in real time. Remember, you can get a full body view of your Mii 
by clicking the figure to the left with the Wii Remote pointer.
 
 Facial Features Menus: Click any of the remaining seven tabs at the top of 
the Mii editing screen to bring up a variety of facial feature options. Click 
any of these facial feature options to assign it to the Mii shown on the left. 
Don’t like how it looks? Just click another feature in the center area to 
change it again. Other options for editing the look of particular facial 
feature are shown in Figure 7-5 and discussed in the list that follows:

• Flip page: Use these buttons to scroll through multiple pages of 
facial feature options. The current page number and total number 
of pages are shown in the center. Note that some facial features 
only have one page of options to choose from.
 
• Colors: Click a color box to change the color of the currently 
selected facial feature. Refer to Figure 7-5.
 
 
• Position: Use these buttons to change the vertical position of the 
current facial feature. This effect can be quite extreme if you click 
multiple times. Try moving your Mii’s mouth above its eyes for a 
really freaky effect. (See the “Making mysterious Miis” sidebar.)
 
 
• Scale: Use these buttons to change the size of the current facial 
feature.
 
 
• Rotate: Use these buttons to rotate the current facial feature clock-
wise or counterclockwise. The Rotate buttons are only available in 
the Eyes and Eyebrows menus.
 
 
• Spacing: Click these buttons to tighten or broaden the space between 
the eyes or eyebrows on your Mii. (Like the Rotate buttons, the 
Spacing buttons are only available on the Eyes and Eyebrow menus.)
 
 
• Flip Part: On the hairstyle menu, use this button to reverse the 
direction of certain nonsymmetrical parts.
 
 Note that some of the facial feature submenus have further submenus 
of their own. On the Facial Shape menu, click the circle above the facial 
shape options to add subtle features like freckles, rosy cheeks, eye 
shadow, and more. In the Miscellaneous submenu, you can find further 
menus for beards, mustaches, and even a beauty mark. Don’t be afraid 
to click around and explore — remember, you can always undo 
whatever you’ve done.
 
 Quit: When you’re done creating your Mii, click Quit to return to the Mii 
Plaza. Don’t worry; you’re asked to save your Mii before quitting out of 
the menu (you can also quit without saving if you aren’t happy with how 
your Mii turned out).
 
 If you haven’t given a nickname to your Mii yet, you have to enter one using 
the on-screen keyboard before saving your Mii. Don’t worry if there’s still 
something you don’t like about the Mii — you can come back and edit it later.
Mii Plaza
The Mii Plaza is where the Miis you’ve created or downloaded from the 
Internet hang out when they’re not being used in games or Channels. It also 
serves at the main menu of sorts for the Mii Channel, letting you create, 
delete, manage, and share your Miis with others. This section provides a 
complete guide to doing all these things.

111
 Chapter 7: Those Marvelous Miis
 
You can store only 100 Miis in your Mii Plaza at any one time. If the plaza 
is full, you won’t be able to create new Miis or download Miis from the Mii 
Parade or the Check Mii Out Channel. Delete some of your least favorite Miis, 
or store them in the Mii Parade (see the later section, “The Mii Parade”).
Navigating the Mii Plaza
The Mii Plaza is like an aquarium for your Miis — a featureless void where they 
wander around, chat, fall asleep, and even occasionally wave at the camera. 
Your initial view of the Mii Plaza is only a small section of that aquarium, though. 
Use the following controls to view and interact with the rest of the Mii Plaza:
 
 Zoom: If there are a lot of Miis in your Plaza, it can be hard to see them 
all on the screen at once. To fix this problem, use the + and – buttons on 
the Wii Remote to zoom the camera in and out, respectively. There are 
four levels of zoom.
 
 Identify: Point and click a Mii with the A button to see the Mii’s name 
appear in a word balloon above his or her head. If the Mii was created 
by one of your registered Wii Friends, the creator’s name is also shown. 
You’ll also notice a gray circle in the identifying word balloon. Click this 
circle to designate the Mii as one of your favorites. Your favorite Miis 
tend to show up more often in Mii-compatible games. Click anywhere 
else on the screen to make the name bubble disappear.
 
 Scroll: Point the Wii Remote at the Mii Plaza screen and hold the B button 
to bring up a scrolling interface with four arrows on the edges of the screen. 
While still holding the B button, move the pointer in any direction to scroll 
your viewpoint in that direction. Let go of the B button to stop scrolling. 
You can also use the directional pad on the Wii Remote to scroll.
Making mysterious Miis
The wide variety of facial feature options in the 
Mii Channel’s Mii maker means you can mimic 
practically any human face. But why stop there? 
Using some creative positioning, coloring, 
and sizing you can create much more than just 
human faces. Here are some basic tips:
  The right combination of mustache, beard, 
and hairstyle can make an animalistic Mii.
  Try arching the eyebrows and positioning 
them inside the hair to make a faux crown!
  Why go with the regular facial order? Turn 
a Mii’s face upside down by moving the 
mouth above the eyes.
  Try hiding facial features in other facial fea-
tures for noseless, mouthless or even eye-
less creations.
  Use the Check Mii Out Channel for 
inspiration!

112
Part II: The Channels 
 
 Picking up: Hover the pointer over a Mii and press the A and B buttons 
simultaneously to pick the Mii up, as shown in Figure 7-6. You can move 
the Mii around by moving the Wii Remote pointer. Hold the Mii near the 
edge of the screen to scroll in the direction of that edge. Let go of either 
button on the Wii Remote to drop the Mii in its current location.
 
 While carrying a Mii, you can also drag it to the Edit Mii, Erase Mii, or 
Send to Mii Parade buttons. The functions are discussed in the next 
section.

Mii Plaza menu
While you’re in the Mii Plaza, point the Wii Remote at the screen to bring 
up the menu shown in Figure 7-7. The options on this menu let you create, 
edit, and share your Miis, as well as download new Miis from the Mii Parade. 
These menu options are described in further detail in the following list, 
starting from the upper-left corner:
 
 Wii Menu: Click this button to return to the Wii Menu. Remember, 
you can also return to the Wii Menu at any time by pressing the Home 
button on the Wii Remote.
 
 Edit Mii: Not happy with how one of your Miis looks? Drag it over to this 
circle to rejigger it in the Mii Editing menu, as described in the earlier 
section, “Editing your Mii’s facial features.”

113
 Chapter 7: Those Marvelous Miis
 
 Note that you can only edit Miis that were created on your personal Wii. 
Miis downloaded from the Mii Parade or the Check Mii Out Channel are 
locked and can’t be edited.
 
 New Mii: Click this button to create a new Mii. When you’re done, the 
freshly created Mii drops into your Mii Plaza.
 
 Erase Mii: Is your Mii Plaza getting too cluttered? Pick up and drag a Mii 
over to this circle to remove it from your system permanently.
 
Be careful! There’s no way to undo this Mii erasure, so think long and 
hard before you confirm the deletion.

Note that you can also clear space in the Mii Plaza by sending a Mii to 
the Mii Parade for long-term storage. (See the Mii Parade bullet.)
 
 When you erase a Mii from the Mii Plaza, you also erase its data from 
any Wii games that might use that Mii as a character. This can cause 
you to lose important progress data. Be careful erasing Miis you use in 
games.

114
Part II: The Channels 
 
 Help: Bring up on-screen directions for navigating the Mii Plaza. These 
are all covered in the “Navigating the Mii Plaza” section, though, so you 
can just pretend this button doesn’t exist. Just look away whenever your 
eyes happen to hover over it. Maybe put a little piece of paper on the 
screen to block it from your sight permanently.
 
 Mii Parade: Click this button to bring up the Mii Parade, which is dis-
cussed in further detail in the following section. You can also pick up 
a Mii from the Mii Plaza floor and drag it over to this icon to transfer it 
from the Mii Plaza to the Mii Parade. This frees up space in the Mii Plaza 
while still allowing you to recover the Mii from the Mii Parade at a later 
date, if you so desire. Note that Miis in the Mii Parade can’t be used in 
games and other Channels without first being brought back to the Mii 
Plaza.
 
 Transfer Mii: That Wii Remote in your hands isn’t just good for navigat-
ing games and menus. You can also use it to store up to ten Miis, which 
you can then use on a friend’s Wii. Follow these steps to transfer Miis on 
and off your Remote:
 
1. Click the Transfer Mii button.
 
 A list of the Remotes currently connected to the Wii is displayed.
 
2. Click the icon for the Remote which you want to use to transfer 
Miis.
 
 If the Remote you want to use is not connected to the Wii, first 
press the 1 and 2 buttons on that Remote simultaneously, then 
choose its icon on the screen.
 
3. Drag the desired Mii to one of the empty white circles.
 
 After you’ve chosen a Remote, the contents of that Remote are 
shown at the top of the Mii Plaza menu, as shown in Figure 7-8. 
Pick up and drag a Mii to one of the empty white circles to transfer 
a copy on to the Remote. Alternatively, you can drag a Mii from 
one of those circles on to the Mii Plaza floor. This takes the Mii off 
the Remote and adds it to the Mii Plaza. Note that if there’s a copy 
of the Mii already in the Plaza, it’s replaced with the version from 
the Remote.
 
 You can also Erase Miis from the Wii Remote or the Mii Plaza 
by dragging them to the Erase Mii button on the left side of the 
screen.
 
4. Click Save & Quit when you’re done transferring Miis.
 
 The Wii spends a few seconds transferring the Miis in the white 
circles on to your Wii Remote. You can now take this Remote over 
to a friend’s Wii and use your personal Miis over there.

115
 Chapter 7: Those Marvelous Miis
 
 Wii Friend: Use this button to send a Mii to one of your registered Wii 
Friends over the Internet (see Chapter 4 for more on connecting your 
Wii to your broadband Internet connection). First, click the envelope 
button to display the mail icon at the top of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 7-9. From here, pick up and drag the Mii you want to send to the 
white circle in the envelope.

 After dropping the Mii in the envelope, a menu pops up with a list of 
your registered Wii Friends (see Chapter 5 for more on registering Wii 
Friends). Click the friend you want to send the Mii to and confirm by 
clicking Yes. The Mii appears in your friend’s Mii Plaza the next time he 
or she starts up the Mii Channel. Click the Quit button when you’re done 
sending Miis.
 
 Arrange: Tired of seeing your Miis meandering around the Plaza like 
a bunch of lazy layabouts? Click the Arrange button (it looks like a 
whistle) to call the Miis to attention in nice, orderly rows and columns. 
Clicking the Arrange button also brings up a new row of options on the 
bottom row of the Mii Plaza menu:
 
 
• Number: Clicking this icon doesn’t do anything, but the number 
tells you exactly how many Miis are in your plaza. (Remember, you 
can only have 100 Miis in your Plaza at any one time.)
 
 
• Whistle: Click the whistle again to disband the Wiis and let them 
wander and mingle as they please.
 
 
• Alphabetical: Arrange your Miis in alphabetical order by their 
nicknames, starting in the bottom-left corner and proceeding to 
the right and upward.
 
 
• Favorites: The Miis you’ve designated as your favorites line up in 
the front, while the rest of the riff-raff are arranged in the back. To 
designate a Mii as a favorite, click the Mii and then click the gray 
circle that appears in the word balloon above the Mii’s head. You 
can also click the Favorite box on the Edit Mii Profile tab when 
you’re editing or creating the Mii.
 
 
• Color: Arrange your Miis in rows by the color of their shirts. The 
lines look almost like the bars of a rainbow, don’t they?
 
 
• Gender: Click the Gender button to separate the males and 
females. Boys to the left, girls to the right, everybody’s gonna party 
tonight!
The Mii Parade
If your Wii is connected to the Internet, Miis from your registered Wii Friends can 
wander over and gather in the Mii Parade area. The Miis in the Mii Parade can’t 
be used in games or other Channels until you transfer them to the Mii Plaza.
Setting up the Mii Parade
To get Miis in your parade, first make sure your Wii is connected to the 
Internet and that WiiConnect24 is turned on. You also have to register some 
Wii Friends to share Miis with (see Chapter 4) and both you and your friends 
have to turn on the travel settings for your Mii Parades (see the next section).

117
 Chapter 7: Those Marvelous Miis
After this is done, any Miis that have been set to mingle start to meander 
over through the Internet ether (see the “Editing your Mii’s facial features” 
section for more on mingling Miis). Be patient — it may take a few days after 
setting everything up for the first Miis to wander over to your parade.
Using the Mii Parade menu
Click the Mii Parade button to bring up the Mii Parade screen, as shown in 
Figure 7-10. Click a marching Mii to stop him or her marching and see his or 
her name, or click one of the options on the Mii Parade menu, also shown in 
Figure 7-10 and described in the following list:
 
 Send to Mii Plaza: Pick up a marching Mii and drag him to this circle to 
add him to your Mii Plaza (see the “Navigating the Mii Plaza” section for 
more on picking up and moving Miis). This Mii drops into your Mii Plaza, 
ready to be used in games, other Channels, and the Wii Message Board. 
Note that you can’t edit the features of Miis created by other people. 
Also note that you can only hold 100 Miis in your Plaza at any one time.
 
 Erase Mii: If your parade is getting too crowded, pick up and drag any of 
the marching Miis to this circle to remove them from the Parade perma-
nently. Note that the Mii Parade can hold up to 10,000 Miis at once, so 
the only real reason to remove Miis is if you don’t like the way they look.

 Travel Settings: Before any Miis can join your parade, you and your 
registered Wii Friends first have to turn on the Travel Settings through 
this menu. Click the Travel Setting icon, and then the Travel button to 
turn the feature on. Choose Don’t Travel to stop the automatic inflow 
and outflow of Miis through the Internet.
 
 See the “Setting up the Mii Parade” section for more requirements for 
filling up your Mii Parade. Remember, only Miis set to mingle travel to 
your friends’ systems. The more registered Wii Friends turn on this 
feature, the more Miis wander into your parade.
 
 Speed: Click the running-man icon to toggle the Miis’ marching speed 
between a slow walk and a fast trot.
Checking Out the Check Mii Out Channel
We human beings have things like fashion magazines, reality shows, and 
beauty pageants to tell us who to deify for physical attractiveness. Miis have 
the Check Mii Out Channel, an online clearinghouse for Wii owners to put 
their creations up to be evaluated by the harsh criticism of the public. The 
following sections tell you everything you need to know to become one of the 
nervous Mii artisans, one of the public evaluators, or both!
Checking Mii Out for the first time
To use the Check Mii Out Channel, you first have to get your Wii hooked up 
to a high-speed Internet connection (see Chapter 4 for more on this). When 
you’re online, head over to the Wii Shop Channel and download the Check 
Mii Out Channel from the Channels section. (See Chapter 6 for more on using 
the Wii Shop Channel.) The Check Mii Out Channel is absolutely free and 
takes up 91 blocks of space on your Wii’s internal memory (see Chapter 5 for 
more on memory management). After the Channel is downloaded, you start it 
just as you would any other Channel from the Wii Menu.
The first time you load up the Check Mii Out Channel, you’re presented with 
some on-screen information about how to use it. You can skip through these 
screens by pressing the A button. (You won’t need them . . . that’s what you 
have this book for!) You then are asked to choose a Mii to represent you as 
an “artisan.” This serves as your public face for people evaluating the Miis 
you upload to the Channel. Use the on-screen arrows to scroll through the 
list of Miis in your Mii Plaza then click your desired Mii to select it.
 
If you pick a Mii with an inappropriate nickname as your artisan, Nintendo 
might block your access to the Channel.

 Chapter 7: Those Marvelous Miis
After picking your artisan, the Channel asks if you want to sign up for the 
Check Mii Out Channel messaging service. This service sends you Wii Message 
Board messages whenever a new contest is available for evaluation on the Check 
Mii Out Channel (see Chapter 5 for more on the Wii Message Board). If you turn 
this service on now, you can always turn it off later from the Settings menu.
After this brief setup process, you see the Check Mii Out Channel’s main menu, 
as shown in Figure 7-11. The Posting Plaza and Contests options are detailed in 
the following sections. The other menu options are discussed in the 
following list:
 
 Wii Menu: Return to the Wii Menu. Remember, you can also return to the 
Wii Menu at any time by pressing the Home button on the Wii Remote.
 
 Mii Artisan Info: Click the face of your currently selected Mii artisan to 
access data about your Mii posting history. This information includes 
your average star ranking, your most popular posted Mii, and the quality 
of your contest judging (see the “Contests” section). Click the on-screen 
arrows to scroll through the information screens. You can also click the 
Change button in the upper-left corner to choose a new Mii artisan, just 
as you did the first time you used the Channel. Click the Back button to 
return to the Check Mii Out Channel’s main menu.
 
 Settings: Use the on-screen buttons to change your status on the Check 
Mii Out Channel’s messaging service. You can also change the language 
the messages are delivered in from English to French or Spanish, if 
you’re into that sort of thing.

Navigating the Check Mii Out Channel
You can use your Wii Remote to navigate around both the Posting Plaza and 
Contest evaluation screens. Use the following Wii Remote commands to get 
around:
 
 Viewing a Mii: Click a Mii to bring up a larger view of it, along with a 
menu with more options for viewing and evaluating the Mii and its ilk. 
See the “Viewing Mii details” section for more on viewing posted Miis.
 
 Scrolling: There are two ways to scroll through the Posting Plaza. The 
first (and simpler) is to use the up and down arrows on the Wii Remote’s 
directional pad. The second is to point the Wii Remote at the screen, 
hold down the B button, and move the Remote pointer up and down. Let 
go of the B button when you’re done scrolling.
 
 Zoom: Use the + and – buttons on the Wii Remote to change the number 
of Miis you can see at once, from a minimum of three to a maximum 
of 50.
 
 Grabbing and moving a Mii: If you don’t like where a particular Mii is 
standing, you can changes its location by pointing at the Mii and 
grabbing it by pressing and holding the A and B buttons on the Wii 
Remote simultaneously. While still holding the buttons, move the Mii to 
your new desired location with the Wii Remote pointer, and then let go 
of the buttons to set the Mii down in its new position.
Posting Plaza
The Check Mii Out Channel Posting Plaza, as shown in Figure 7-12, is like an 
Internet-enabled version of the Mii Plaza. In the Posting Plaza, Miis submitted 
from Wii owners worldwide hang out, waiting for people like you to gawk at 
them and evaluate them like a piece of meat! Best of all, you can add your 
own Miis to this feeding frenzy.
The Posting Plaza menu
Use the Wii Remote Commands described in the “Navigating the Check Mii 
Out Channel” section to browse the Miis. You can click the menu buttons 
surrounding the edge of the screen for more options. These buttons are 
shown in Figure 7-12 and described in the following list:

 This brings up a selection of ten Miis from your Mii Plaza.
 
2. Choose which Mii you want to post.
 
 Click the on-screen arrows or use the left and right buttons on the 
Wii Remote’s directional pad to scroll through the pages of Miis. 
When you find the Mii you want to post, click it, and then click Yes 
to confirm. Note that you can only post Miis that were created on 
your system, not Miis that you downloaded from friend or from the 
Mii Parade.
 
3. Enter initials for the Mii.
 
 The Check Mii Out Channel uses two-letter initials, rather than 
nicknames, to identify Miis. Use the on-screen keyboard to choose 
the initials you want to identify the Mii.
 
4. Choose a skill for the Mii.

124
Part II: The Channels 
 
 This skill is used to further identify the Mii to other users of the 
Check Mii Out Channel. Click the up and down arrows on the 
screen or press the up and down buttons on the Wii Remote’s 
directional pad to scroll through the list, and then click your 
choice. If the Mii is a caricature of a famous celebrity, choose a 
skill that reflects what the celeb is known for. Otherwise, just pick 
a skill that reflects his or her face, or just be random.
 
5. Confirm your posting.
 
 Look over your Mii and confirm that you actually want to post it 
and that the data you entered is correct. When you click Yes, the 
Mii is shared with the world, with no way to take it back.
 
 After posting your Mii, the Wii displays an entry number for your 
submission. This number is a unique identifier for your posting that 
can be used by others to find it easily using the Search function in 
the Call Out menu (discussed earlier). You can write this number 
down for safekeeping, or get it later by viewing your submissions 
through the Call Out menu.
 
 Parade: Click the button with the picture of a stick figure to have the 
current selection of Miis present themselves in a parade format. The 
Miis walk from the top of the screen in groups of three, posing in a large 
spotlight before moving on. Click any Mii during this parade to pause 
the marching and see that Mii’s details. Click the Parade button again to 
go back to the arranged, grid view of the Miis.
 
 Search Area: Click the American-flag icon to bring up a menu allowing you 
to toggle between a regional and a worldwide search. Click the Change 
button to toggle and then click Exit to go back.
Viewing Mii details
While browsing the Posting Plaza, you can click any Mii to view its face up 
close. You can also view more details about the Mii and access further menu 
options, as shown in Figure 7-15. These menu options are discussed in the 
following list:
 
 Profile: Click the book icon in the upper-right corner to bring up more 
information about the current Mii, including its popularity (out of five 
stars), its Mii artisan, the region it comes from, and its unique entry 
number, as shown in Figure 7-16. Click the book again to go back to the 
menu view as shown in Figure 7-15. Pushing the + or – buttons on the Wii 
Remote also toggles the view.
 
 Import Mii: Save a copy of the current Mii to your local Mii Plaza. Before 
making the copy, use the on-screen keyboard to enter a personal 
nickname for the Mii. (Mii nicknames can have up to ten characters.) 
Click OK to copy the Mii to your Mii Plaza.

 Note that the Mii Plaza can only hold 100 Miis. If you have too many 
you won’t be able to import Miis from the Check Mii Out Channel. Erase 
some Miis or move them to the Mii Parade to clear out some space.
 
 I Like It: Click this button to add the Mii to your personal favorites. This 
helps increase the Mii’s star ranking and makes it easy to find later using 
the Favorites option on the Call Out menu.
 
 Call Friends: One of the most interesting features on the Check Mii Out 
Channel, click this button to see a collection of Miis that are similar to 
the current Mii in some way. This could mean they have a similar face, 
the same initials, or the same artisan. It’s interesting to see how slight 
changes can have a large effect. When you’re done browsing the friends, 
click the Leave button in the corner to go back to the Posting Plaza 
menu.
 
When viewing Mii details, you can press the B button on the Wii Remote or 
click the Back button in the lower-left corner of the screen to return to the 
wider Posting Plaza view. You can also use the directional pad on the Wii 
Remote to scroll through the details of other Miis without first backing out 
into the Posting Plaza menu.
Contests
Posting random Miis for public approval is all well and good, but sometimes 
having a specific goal can help focus your thinking. The Check Mii Out 
Channel’s contests are designed to bring out your creativity by asking you to 
design a Mii to match a specific goal, as shown in Figure 7-17.

The list of currently running contests is displayed as soon as you click the 
Contests button on the Check Mii Out Channel main menu (refer to Figure 
7-11). Click a contest to expand the menu with the options to enter the 
contest or click the Make a Mii button. Clicking Make a Mii returns you to the 
Wii Menu to create a Mii using the Mii Channel.
When you have a Mii you’d like to enter in a contest, click Enter Contest and 
then click Next to read through the few pages of disclaimers. Then choose 
from the Miis available in your Mii plaza, using the on-screen arrows or the 
arrows on the Wii Remote’s directional pad to scroll through the pages. You 
can submit only one entry per contest, but you can change the entry by 
entering the contest again.
Judging contests
If you’d rather judge than be judged, you can judge a contest as follows:
 
1. Click the Judge button on the Contest menu (refer to Figure 7-17).
 
2. Click the contest you’d like to judge.
 
 This brings up the judging menu, as shown in Figure 7-18.

Viewing contest results
Click the Results button (refer to Figure 7-17) and then choose the 
completed contest you’d like to view the results for. The relative popularity 
of your selections for the contest is shown in a cute animation set against a 
mountaintop. After this, the Mii that garnered the most votes overall walks 
out and waves. Click the Congratulations button, or click the Skip button in 
the lower-right corner to get to the top 50.
Browse the top 50 the same way you’d browse Miis in the Posting Plaza. Use 
the Parade button to switch between an arrangement and a parade. Click a 
Mii to see the artisan and get the option to import the Mii to your local Mii 
Plaza.

T
here’s a lot to love about digital cameras: the capability to review your 
shots instantly; the option to touch up blemishes on the computer; 
freedom from expensive film and development costs. But when it comes 
time to view those digital pictures, things aren’t always so convenient. 
Squinting at a tiny camera or cell phone screen is hardly the ideal way to 
view those party shots, and gathering a large group around the office PC to 
see your vacation photos is just as cumbersome.
Luckily, your Wii makes it easy to view digital photos and videos on your TV. 
Just pop in a SmartDigital card full of pictures and fire up the Wii’s Photo 
Channel to browse through your shots with ease from the comfort of your 
couch. You can even create musical slide shows and play around with your 
photos directly on the screen. Sound complicated? Don’t worry. This chapter 
gives you everything you need to become a Photo Channel pro.
Viewing Photos and Videos
When you first select the Photo Channel from the Wii’s Home menu (see 
Chapter 5 for more on this), you’re greeted with a screen asking, “Which 
photos do you want to view?” as shown in Figure 8-1. I cover viewing Wii 
Message Board photos later in this chapter — for now, I focus on viewing 
photos by choosing Digital Camera/Cell Phone.

130
Part II: The Channels 
 
Figure 8-1:

Getting photos and videos onto an SD card
The first step to getting your photos onto your TV through the Wii is getting 
them onto an SD card. (You can see a picture of an SD card on the Photo 
Channel introduction screen, shown in Figure 8-1.) Many digital and cell 
phone cameras can store images directly to an SD card as you take them. If 
you have such a camera, congratulations — you have a lot less work to do.
If you’re one of those unfortunate souls who has digital photos stored on a 
different medium (such as a CD-ROM, a computer hard drive, a CompactFlash 
card, and such), you need to transfer your photos to an SD card before viewing 
them with the Wii. Some newer computers come with a built-in SD card slot for 
copying photos and files to an SD card. For older computers, an external SD 
card reader that hooks up to your computer’s USB port can provide the same 
functionality. If neither of these is an option, your local photo processor can 
probably help you transfer your photos over to an SD card.
 
The Wii’s SD card slot only accepts pictures on full-size SD cards — not the 
microSD or miniSD cards used by most cell phone cameras (and some smaller 
digital cameras). You can find adapters to make these smaller cards fit into 
the Wii’s standard-size SD slot at most electronics retailers — they should set 
you back only a couple of bucks.
After you have your photos on an SD card, simply slide the card into the slot on 
the front of the system. Figure 8-2 shows how to open the SD slot’s protective 
cover and correctly insert the SD card. The card slides in with a slight click. To 
remove the card later, simply push in slightly and the card pops right out.

131
 Chapter 8: The Photo Channel
 
Figure 8-2: 
Inserting 
a card into 
the Wii’s SD 
card slot.
 
After the SD card is in the system, turn it on and choose the Photo Channel 
from the Wii’s Channel menu (described in Chapter 5). Click the Digital 
Camera/Cell Phone button and the system automatically scans the SD card 
for photos and videos (it doesn’t matter what folder they’re in — the Wii 
finds them all). This process may take a few seconds. When it’s done, click 
the View button to see these photos and movies arranged chronologically as 
a grid of thumbnails on the screen, as shown in Figure 8-3.
 
The Wii Photo Channel starts to break down if it tries to display more than 
1,000 photos at a time. If your SD card has more than 1,000 photos on it, 
consider backing them up or deleting them. (Also consider being a little 
more discriminating with your future shot selections.)

Part II: The Channels 
Navigating the thumbnail menu
Getting around the thumbnail menu is as simple as clicking the on-screen 
buttons, as shown in Figure 8-3 and explained in the following list. Note that 
many on-screen buttons have analogues on the Wii Remote that perform the 
same function. Using the Wii Remote buttons makes navigation much quicker 
and simpler.
 
 Zoom –: Reduce the size of the thumbnails so you can show more on 
screen at once. Pressing the – button on the Wii remote has the same 
effect.
 
 Up Arrow: Scroll upward through the list of thumbnails. Pressing up on 
the Wii Remote’s directional pad has the same effect.
 
 Zoom +: Increase the size of the thumbnails so you end up showing 
fewer on-screen at the same time. Pressing the + button on the Wii 
remote has the same effect.
 
 Back: Return to the Photo Channel’s main menu.
 
 Down Arrow: Scroll downward through the list of thumbnails. Pressing 
down on the Wii Remote’s directional pad has the same effect.
 
 Slide Show: Start a slide show of all the photos and movies on the menu. 
See the “Watching photo slide shows” section for more on this.
 
You can also scroll through the thumbnail menu by holding down the B 
button on the Wii Remote and pointing toward the top and bottom of the 
screen. The on-screen pointer icon changes to a picture of a B button when 
you do this. This is especially useful for scrolling through massive sets of 
zoomed thumbnails quickly.
Viewing photos
Now that you can find your way around the thumbnail menu, simply click a 
thumbnail to blow it up to full screen size. The photo may appear slightly blurry 
for a few seconds, but it becomes sharper when the Wii finishes loading it.
 
The Photo Channel won’t work with photos with resolution greater than 
8192 x 8192 pixels, according to the manual. It would take a 67.1-megapixel 
camera to generate an image that big, so it’s not going to be an issue for 
most shutterbugs. I just thought I’d warn you in case you’re planning to 
view a hyper-detailed map of the Interstate highway system or something.
Pointing the Wii Remote at the screen displays the time and date the picture 
was taken. It also brings up a translucent menu with a variety of navigation 
options, as shown in Figure 8-4 and described in the following list:

133
 Chapter 8: The Photo Channel
 
Figure 8-4:

 Zoom –: Zoom out from the photo. Pressing the – button on the Wii 
Remote has the same effect.
 
 Previous: View the previous photo in the thumbnail list. Pressing left on 
the Wii Remote’s directional pad has the same effect.
 
 Rotation Arrows: Change the orientation of the picture by rotating it 90 
degrees clockwise. These arrows are useful for correcting photos taken 
with a rotated camera.
 
 Next: View the next photo in the thumbnail list. Pressing right on the Wii 
Remote’s directional pad has the same effect.
 
 Zoom +: Zoom in to the photo. Pressing the + button on the Wii Remote 
has the same effect.
 
 When zoomed in, you can use the arrow buttons on the bottom-right 
quadrant of the picture to pan around the photo. Alternatively, you can 
hold the B button and point the Wii Remote toward the edges of the 
screen to scroll around.
 
 Back: Takes you back to the thumbnail menu. Pressing the A button on 
the Wii Remote while pointing at the photo itself has the same effect.
 
 Post: Saves the picture to the Wii’s internal Message Board. See the 
“Posting and Sharing Photos: The Wii Message Board” section, later in 
this chapter, for more.
 
 Fun!: Applies a selection of fun effects to the photo. See the “Playing 
with Your Photos: The Fun! Menu” section, later in this chapter for more.
 
 Slide Show: Presents a slide show of all the pictures in the list. See the 
following section, “Watching photo slide shows,” for details.

Watching photo slide shows
Tired of manually clicking through each and every photo in your collection? 
Choose the Slide Show option from the thumbnail or picture menus and the 
Wii shows each of your photos in sequence, automatically. While you don’t 
have that much control over these slide shows, you can alter the experience 
a bit by pressing the A button at any time during the show and choosing the 
Change Settings option. Doing so brings up the menu shown in Figure 8-5, 
explained in the following list:
 
Figure 8-5:

A blur in your saddle
One of the odder features of the Wii’s Photo 
Channel is the capability to pixelate a small 
section of the photo while viewing it. To do this, 
simply point the Wii Remote at the photo and 
push up or down on the Wii Remote’s direc-
tional pad. This also works during slide shows. 
As an added bit of weirdness, pressing down 
during a video also distorts the soundtrack, 
making it higher pitched.
Why was this feature added? Perhaps Nintendo 
wanted parents to be able to edit lascivious 
photos on the fly? Maybe it was required to 
meet the FCC’s decency standards? No . . . more 
likely, the developers were simply bored while 
working on the Channel and added the hidden 
feature as a sort of Easter egg for intrepid users 
to find. Intrepid users like you!

 Order: Click Change to toggle between a chronological viewing order 
and a random one.
 
 Effects: Click Change to toggle among the following options:
 
• Dramatic: The default “slow pan” over the images — kind of like a 
Ken Burns documentary.
 
• Simple: No effects — just a simple, full screen view of each picture.
 
• Nostalgic: Pictures are shown in sepia tone, like an old-timey photo, 
complete with the dramatic slow pan.
 
 Music: Click Choose Song to pick from six built-in background songs: 
Calm, Fun, Bright, Nostalgic, Beautiful, or Scenic, or turn off the music 
entirely. If there are any MP3 files on the SD card, you can use them as 
the background music as well. You can also turn off the music entirely.
 
Want to control the pace of your photo slide show? Use the left and right buttons 
on the Wii Remote’s directional pad to advance the slide show backward and 
forward. You can also use the + and – buttons on the Wii Remote to control the 
volume of the background music that plays over the slide show. (Or, you know, 
you could use your TV remote to control the volume. But really, where’s the fun 
in that?)
Watching videos
Watching digital videos stored on an SD card works much like viewing pictures: 
Simply click the thumbnail and the video starts playing in full-screen mode. 
Videos can be identified on the thumbnail menu by the filmstrip icon on the 
lower-right corner of the thumbnail. You can zoom and rotate a video just like a 
still picture, but picture-editing effects and message-board posting work a little 
differently for videos. (I give you more details about posting and editing in the 
following section.)
 
The Wii Photo Channel only plays videos recorded in the Motion JPEG (PCM) 
format, which is supported by most digital cameras and camera phones. If you 
have videos in another format, you can convert them to the Wii format using 
software such as Red Kawa’s free Wii Video 9. Find it online at www.redkawa.
com/videoconverters/wiivideo9/.
 
There are no on-screen controls for fast-forwarding and rewinding a movie 
while it’s playing. However, you can jump back approximately three seconds 
by pressing the 1 button on your Wii Remote, or jump ahead three seconds by 
pushing the 2 button. You can hold either button for quicker scanning. There’s 
no way to pause a video, however, so don’t go thinking your Wii’s going to 
replace your DVD player.

Part II: The Channels 
Posting and Sharing Photos: 
The Wii Message Board
Storing photos on an SD card is all well and good, but sometimes you want a 
backup of your precious memories with a version that’s always available on 
the Wii itself. Posting photos to the Wii’s internal Message Board does just 
that. Posting to the Message Board also lets you send photos to your friends’ 
Wiis over the Internet.
Posting and viewing Message 
Board photos
Getting photos onto the Wii Message Board couldn’t be simpler. While viewing 
a photo, simply point the Wii Remote at the screen and click the Post button 
on the bottom line of the on-screen menu. Another menu appears, asking if you 
want to post a copy of the picture to the Wii Message Board. Choose Post to 
the Wii Message Board and the picture is posted. Wasn’t that easy? Choose OK 
to move on.
 
What happens if you try to post an image that’s already on the Wii Message 
Board? No, the Wii won’t explode in a logic error — it just posts a second copy 
of the photo to the Message Board, complete with any doodles and mood 
effects you may have applied and permanently saved. Thank goodness for the 
Wii’s anti-paradox circuitry!
While you can’t post entire videos from an SD card to the Wii Message 
Board, you can post individual frames from a video. To do this, simply watch 
the video as you normally would, and click the Post button as soon as you 
see the frame you want to capture. If you mess up and choose the wrong 
moment, don’t panic — simply choose Don’t Post and try again.
 
You can use the 1 and 2 buttons on the Wii Remote to quickly rewind and fast 
forward, respectively, while watching videos.
 
The Wii has a limited amount of space to store Message Board photos — 512 
megabytes, to be exact. These photos have to share space with things like 
games and applications downloaded from the Wii Shop Channel (see Chapter 
6 for more about the Wii Shop Channel). This only really becomes an issue if 
you plan on storing hundreds of photos on the system, but it is something to 
keep in the back of your mind as you post.

137
 Chapter 8: The Photo Channel
After a photo has been posted to the Wii Message Board, you can always 
view it by choosing the View Wii Message Board Photos from the initial 
Photo Channel menu. Note that photos on the Message Board are arranged 
chronologically by the date they were posted to the Wii, not by the date 
they were taken.
Sending Message Board 
photos over the Internet
In addition to permanent, SD-card-free viewing, posting a photo to the Wii 
Message Board lets you e-mail the images to your friends’ Wiis. Follow these 
steps to e-mail a photo to a friend’s Wii:
 
1. Make sure your Wii is connected to the Internet and that you and your 
friend have exchanged and registered each other’s Wii Friend Codes.
 
 See Chapter 4 for more information on how to make those preparations.
 
2. Post your image to the Wii Message Board as described in the 
previous section.
 
 If you’ve already posted the photo to the Message Board, you can skip 
this step — you don’t need to do it again.
 
3. Push the Home button on the Wii Remote and choose Wii Menu.
 
4. Click the Envelope icon in the bottom-right corner of the Wii Menu.
 
 Doing so brings up the Wii Message Board, as shown in Figure 8-6.
 
Figure 8-6: 
The Wii 
Message 
Board.

5. Find the picture on the Message Board.
 
 If you posted the picture to the Wii Message Board today, it should 
immediately appear as an envelope on the screen. If you posted the 
photo earlier, you need to find it by navigating to the appropriate day. 
(See Chapter 4 for more on navigating the Message Board.)
 
6. Click the Envelope icon with your image in it.
 
 A message pops up with a thumbnail of your picture and the words 
“From the Photo Channel” prominently displayed.
 
 At this point, you can delete the photo from the Message Board by 
clicking the Trash Can icon in the upper-left corner of the screen and 
then choosing OK. This is useful for keeping your Message Board 
organized and for freeing up space for newer photos if your Message 
Board is getting too crowded.
 
7. Click the picture thumbnail.
 
 This brings up a full-screen view of the photo.
 
8. Choose Send.
 
 A list of the friends you’ve registered on your Wii appears.
 
9. Choose the friend you want to send the picture to and click his or her 
name.
 
 You may need to scroll through the list using the arrows on the sides of 
the screen.
 
10. Complete your message and click Send.
 
 You can add text and attach a Mii to your photo before sending it off. Or 
choose Quit to abort the process.
Playing With Your Photos: 
The Fun! Menu
Because the Wii is, at its heart, a video-game system, it shouldn’t be too 
surprising that the Photo Channel lets you play with your photos in addition 
to just viewing them. The Photo Channel’s Fun! menu lets you play around 
with the mood of a photo or video, doodle on it with the Wii Remote, and 
even play a simple sliding puzzle game created from your photo.

139
 Chapter 8: The Photo Channel
To play with all these options, simply view any photo and choose Fun! to 
bring up the menu shown in Figure 8-7. I discuss each of the Fun! menu 
options individually in the following sections.
 
Figure 8-7: 
The Fun! 
menu.
 
That darn cat
If you’re hanging around on the Fun! menu long 
enough (about five seconds or so), you’ll notice 
a small black cat walking around the yellow 
title bar at the top of the screen. (You can see 
him at the top of Figure 8-7.) If you leave little 
Blackie (I like to call him Blackie) alone for a 
minute or so, the cutie pie sits down and start 
meowing through your speakers. When he’s sit-
ting, Blackie also follows your pointer around 
with his head as you wave it around the screen. 
Be careful not to move the pointer too close, 
though — Blackie scares quite easily.
What initially seems an adorable throwaway 
feature is actually much more. If your Remote 
hand is quick and steady enough, you can actu-
ally catch Blackie and click him as he’s running 
away from your pointer. Your reward is an on-
screen tip about getting the most out of the 
Photo Channel — navigation shortcuts, hidden 
features, and the like. (Hey . . . wait a minute . . . 
that’s what I’m doing in this chapter! Blackie’s 
trying to horn in on my business! Doesn’t he 
know I’m the hot-shot author around here?)

140
Part II: The Channels 
Mood
The Mood menu lets you apply four different visual effects to your photos 
and videos, as shown in Figure 8-8 and described in the following list:
 
Figure 8-8: 
The Mood 
menu.
 
 
 Brighten: Click this button to add some more light to your shots — 
perfect for photos taken at dark parties. Clicking the Brighten button 
multiple times cycles through eight different levels of brightness.
 
 Black and White: Distills the picture into a colorless grayscale image. 
This is what the entire world looked like before the invention of color 
photographs. It’s true!
 
 Zap!: Transform your photo in a crazy, alternate-universe version of 
itself. This is what the film negative of the image would look like on a 
traditional camera.
 
 Hard-Boiled: By far the oddest mood-changing option, this button creates 
a rough black outline of the objects in the picture — kind of like a coloring 
book. It may not look quite right when you first click the button, but 
clicking again cycles through different levels of, er, hard-boiling.
 
Each mood change comes with an accompanying change in the background 
music for the Photo Channel. When viewing videos, the actual soundtrack 
from the video is altered as well.

141
 Chapter 8: The Photo Channel
When you’re happy with the mood you’ve chosen, choose Back to go back 
to the Fun! menu. To view your mood-altered picture, choose Back again. If 
you want to save a copy of the altered picture, choose Post to copy it to the 
Wii Message Board. (See the previous section for more on this.) If you don’t 
like the edits, don’t panic! Just go back to the Mood menu and choose Undo 
Changes.
Posting to the Message Board is also the only way to layer the mood options 
on top of one another. Simply choose a mood, save the picture to the 
Message Board, and then open up the new copy and choose a new mood to 
put on top of it. You can repeat this process as many times as you want, but 
remember to delete the earlier versions of the photo when you’re finished; 
otherwise your Message Board could get pretty crowded.
 
It’s important to note here that any changes made to your photos cannot be 
saved to an SD card. On the one hand, this means your moods and doodles are 
trapped on the Wii, and impossible to get to a computer with a professional 
editing program. On the other hand, it means the original version of the photo 
on the SD card remains unchanged, so you don’t have to worry about ruining 
your raw shots. So go nuts!
Doodle
Some of the most fun you can have with the Photo Channel can be found by 
clicking the Doodle button on the Fun! menu. This mode offers a variety of 
tools to draw on top of your photo, as shown in Figure 8-9 and explained in 
the following list:
 
Figure 8-9: 
The Doodle 
menu.
 

142
Part II: The Channels 
 
 – button: Zooms out of the picture. Pressing the – button on the Wii 
Remote has the same effect.
 
 Color Dropper icon: Lets you extract a color from the photo. Click the 
dropper once to select it; then click anywhere on the photo to absorb 
the color at that point on the photo. You can now draw on top of the 
photo using that color. This is a great way to get more complex colors 
than the simple color selections offered by the pencil icons.
 
 Pencil icons: Lets you sketch all over the photo in a variety of colors. 
Click a pencil to choose a color, and then click and drag on the photo to 
draw over the photo in that color.
 
 Eraser: Lets you erase all or part of the doodles you’ve already made. 
Click to select the icon, and then click and drag over the doodles to 
erase. Note that the eraser only erases the doodles you’ve added to the 
picture — it can’t erase the original picture itself.
 
 + button: Zooms in to the picture. Pressing the + button on the Wii 
Remote has the same effect.
 
 Back: Goes back to the Fun! menu. Choose Back again to go back to the 
picture viewer. Don’t worry — your doodles are still there.
 
 Stamps: Make your mark on a photo with these fun-filled stamps. Click 
the stamp once to select it, and then click the image to stamp it down. 
Note that the sunglasses stamp cycles randomly through three different 
styles as you stamp it down repeatedly.
 
 Scissors: Lets you replicate part of an image elsewhere. Click the 
scissors to choose them, and then click anywhere on the image to 
choose a starting point for the area you want to replicate. Move the 
pointer to create an oval, or press the 1 button on the Wii Remote to 
select a rectangular area instead. Either way, click the A button once 
more to pick up a copy of that area. Now click anywhere on the photo to 
stamp down replicas of your selection. Pressing the 1 button on the Wii 
Remote after you’ve made your selection flips the stamp horizontally — 
great for creating a mirror image of yourself.
 
 Did you know you can copy a section from one photo and apply it to 
another? It’s true. Simply make your selection with the scissors as 
normal, and then click Back three times to get back to the thumbnail 
menu. Choose another photo, choose Fun!, and then choose Doodle, and 
the selection from the previous photo is available to stamp on to the 
new photo. Neat!
 
 Undo All: As you might expect, this button undoes all your doodles and 
reverts the photo to its original state. The erasure comes complete with 
a cute little rocketship animation flying over the photo. (Aww.)

143
 Chapter 8: The Photo Channel
 
You can change the size of the Pencil, Eraser, and Stamp tools by pushing the 
Wii Remote closer (to make them bigger) or by pulling the Wii Remote farther 
away (to make them smaller) from the Wii Sensor Bar. In addition, you can 
change the orientation of the Stamps and Scissor tool selections by twisting 
the Wii Remote in your hand like a key. Note that the relative size of these 
tools also changes as you zoom in and out of the picture using the + and – 
buttons on the Wii Remote. Experiment with the rotation and size until you’re 
happy with the effect.
 
Remember to save your doodles by posting the edited photos to the Wii 
Message Board, as described in the earlier section, “Posting and Sharing 
Photos: The Wii Message Board.” If you try to start a second doodle before 
saving the changes to the first, the edits you’ve made to the original photo will 
be lost. Also note that after you save the doodles to the Wii Message Board, 
you won’t be able to undo the doodles using the Eraser tool or the Undo All 
command.
Yes, you can doodle on movies, too — the doodles just float statically on top 
of the moving images below them. These doodles show up if you post a frame 
of the movie to the Wii Message Board, but they will not be saved on top of 
the original movie when you turn off the system. Also note that the Scissors 
tool captures a portion of the current frame when you finish your selection, 
so time your cuts wisely.
Puzzle
Even though the Wii is a video-game system, this is the only portion of the 
Photo Channel that actually plays like a traditional game. Choose your photo, 
choose Fun!, and then click Puzzle to get your image chopped up into a 
two-row-by-three-column grid, as shown in Figure 8-10.
To set things right, simply point at a section of the picture and move it by 
clicking and dragging it where you think it should go. Don’t worry about 
pieces overlapping each other — the old section moves to accommodate the 
one you’re placing.
The direction buttons at the bottom of the puzzle shift the entire puzzle in 
that direction, with one side looping around to the opposite end. The Cheat 
button lets you study the original picture; choose Back to the Puzzle! to 
return to solving.

144
Part II: The Channels 
 
Figure 8-10: 
A basic, 
six-piece 
puzzle.
 
When the puzzle is finished, the Wii plays a jaunty melody and gives you a 
round of applause for a job well done. It also tells you your solve time, which 
is saved to the View Records menu if it’s the fastest. After you complete a six-
piece puzzle, buttons appear, giving you the option to try harder puzzles with 
12, 24, or 48 pieces.
 
The puzzle sizes don’t actually top out at 48 pieces. If you hold down the 1 
button on the Wii Remote while on the difficulty selection menu, the 48-piece 
puzzle option transforms into a ridiculous 192-piece puzzle option! This one is 
definitely not for the faint of heart.
 
For a really neat experience, try playing a puzzle based on a video. The 
video continues to play and loop as you solve the puzzle, creating a moving, 
movable mosaic that’s really something to behold (and also much more 
difficult to solve than puzzles made from a static photo).
You can also create your own puzzle, in effect, by doodling on a picture, 
saving it to the Wii Message Board, and then starting a puzzle based on it.

Chapter 9
The Internet Channel
In This Chapter
 Surfing the World Wide Web on your TV using the Wii’s Internet Channel
 Using Favorites and Remote shortcuts to navigate the Channel more easily
 Visiting some useful and entertaining Web sites specifically designed for the Wii
T
he World Wide Web has truly been a communications revolution, 
allowing people the world over to find information and publish their 
thoughts quickly and conveniently. For too long, though, this revolution 
was limited to personal computers that were, quite frankly, way too power-
ful and expensive for mere Web browsing. As technology has continued to 
get cheaper, though, full-scale Web browsers have begun to drift away from 
the PC and toward devices such as cell phones, MP3 players, and yes, even 
game consoles.
Other boxes have tried to bring the Web to the living room TV — most 
notably Microsoft’s now-defunct WebTV — but none have done it nearly so 
well as the Wii’s Internet Channel. It’s hard to overstate how freeing it is to 
surf the Web while sprawled on the couch rather than hunched over the 
computer desk. It’s the difference between seeing the Web as part of your 
entertainment center and seeing it as part of your workstation.
This chapter outlines how to use the Wii’s Internet Channel to navigate the 
Web, using shortcuts to help speed up your surfing. It also introduces you to 
some sites specifically designed for couch-bound surfing.
Web Surfing from Your Couch
The first step to enjoying the Internet Channel is actually downloading the 
Internet Channel. To do this, you need to have your Wii hooked up to your 
TV (as described in Chapter 2) and to a high-speed Internet connection 
(Chapter 4). After this is done, you can purchase and download the Internet 
Channel from Wii Shop Channel (see Chapter 6 for more on using the Wii 
Shop Channel).

146
Part II: The Channels 
Note that you have to spend a one-time fee of 500 Wii Points ($5) before 
downloading the Internet Channel. This might seem a little ridiculous when 
computer-based browsers such as Firefox and Internet Explorer can be 
downloaded for free, but it’s really a small price to pay to unlock the world 
of the World Wide Web on your TV.
 
If you downloaded the Internet Channel before April 11, 2007, you are using 
the “beta” version of the Channel. The rest of this chapter discusses the “full” 
version of the Channel, which features many improvements over the beta 
release. You can upgrade to the full release by downloading a free update 
available on the Wii Shop Channel.
The Internet Channel Start Page
After you’ve downloaded the Internet Channel, start it up by clicking the icon 
on your Wii Menu and then clicking the Start button. A Wii: Opera Powered logo 
shows up on a white background for a few seconds, followed by the Internet 
Channel Start Page (as shown in Figure 9-1). This page may look intimidating, but 
it really has only a few key options, as described in the following list:
 
Figure 9-1: 
The Internet 
Channel 
Start Page.
 
 
 Search: Type in a search term using the on-screen keyboard to search 
the Web for pages on a specific topic (see Chapter 4 for more on using 
the on-screen keyboard). The results appear as a Web page that can be 
navigated like any other (see the later section, “Web page navigation”). 
You can change your preferred search engine using the Settings menu, 
as discussed in the Settings bullet.

147
 Chapter 9: The Internet Channel
 
 Favorites: Also known as bookmarks, the Favorites list is a collection 
of frequently visited sites that you can access quickly without having 
to type in their full Web address. As you can see in Figure 9-2, the Wii’s 
Internet Channel comes pre-configured with a few Favorites right off the 
bat. Just click any of the large icons and the applicable page loads in the 
browser. If and when the list of Favorites extends past one page, you can 
scroll through it just as you would a normal Web page.
 
 You can edit, amend, and share your Favorites list using the navigation 
buttons at the bottom of the Favorites screen, as follows:
 
Figure 9-2: 
The Internet 
Channel 
Favorites 
screen.
 
 
 
• Send Favorite: Send the address of a saved Favorite to any of your 
Wii Friends (for more on registering Wii Friends, see Chapter 4). 
After you click the envelope icon, click the icon for the site you 
want to send, and then choose a registered friend from the list that 
pops up. You can enter an optional message to accompany the site 
using the on-screen keyboard, and then click Send. Your link 
appears as a message on your friend’s Wii Message Board, along 
with the option to open the site directly in the Internet Channel.
 
 When you’re done sending, click the Star icon to go back to your 
Favorites list, or click the X icon to go back to the browser itself.
 
 
• Add Favorite: Click this button to add the last Web page you 
viewed to your Favorites list. Use the Edit Favorites option if you 
want to move or delete this new Favorite.

148
Part II: The Channels 
 
 
• Edit Favorites: Click this icon and then the Favorite you want to 
edit to bring up the menu seen in Figure 9-3. Choose Delete to 
permanently remove the Favorite from the list. Choose Rename 
to change the title of the Favorite using the on-screen keyboard. 
Choose Move to change the position of the Favorite icon to 
another location on your list (simply click your new preferred 
position for that favorite). Click Close to close the menu. When 
you’re done editing Favorites, click the Star icon to get back to 
the Favorites menu or the X icon to go back to the browser.
 
Figure 9-3: 
The Edit 
Favorites 
menu.
 
 
 
• Close: Click the X icon to exit the favorites menu and return to the 
Web browser itself.
 
 Web Address: Click the big “www” balloon to bring up an on-screen key-
board where you can enter a Web address (also known as a URL) for any 
site you’d like to view. Note that the Internet Channel usually doesn’t 
usually require you type in the http://www. prefix that goes before 
many Web addresses, so you can just type wiley.com to view the site 
for the publisher of this fine book. However, sites that start with https 
(note the s at the end) or a prefix other than www may require you to 
type the full address.
 
 Operations Guide: This menu item tells you all about how to use the 
Wii’s Internet Channel. (Of course, this chapter does the same thing, 
with a lot more wit and vivacity than some sterile on-screen guide.)
 
 Settings: Click this button to bring up a page of general Web browsing 
settings, as shown in Figure 9-4. Click and drag the scrollbar on the right 
side of the screen or use the up and down buttons on your Wii Remote to 
scroll through the list. The options in the Settings menu are as follows:

149
 Chapter 9: The Internet Channel
 
Figure 9-4: 
The Internet 
Channel 
Settings 
menu.
 
 
• Zoom Type: Web pages designed for a computer monitor can 
sometime look blurry when displayed on a TV screen. The Internet 
Channel offers a zoom feature to enlarge these blurry pages to 
make them more readable. This option lets you toggle between two 
options for how this feature will work. (See the later section, “Web 
page navigation,” for more on zooming in and out when viewing 
Web pages.)
 
 Choose Manual for a zoom function that moves in and out in small 
increments with each press of the Zoom button. Choose Automatic 
to have the Web browser guess automatically at an optimized 
zoom level when you press the Zoom button.
 
 The Automatic option might seem a good way to save some button 
presses, but it takes away the ability to have precise control over 
your zoom level. Use your discretion.
 
• Toolbar display: Use this option to toggle the appearance of the 
small toolbar at the bottom of the Web browser (refer to Figure 9-1 
to see the toolbar; it’s discussed in the later section, “The toolbar”). 
The Always Display Toolbar option is pretty self-explanatory — the 
toolbar is always there, waiting for you to click its shapely buttons. 
Choose the Auto-Hide Toolbar option to have the toolbar disappear 
when you move the pointer away to other parts of the page — move 
the pointer off the bottom of the screen to reveal the toolbar once 
more. Choosing Button Toggle lets you show and hide the toolbar 
by pressing the 1 button on the Wii Remote.

150
Part II: The Channels 
 
• Search Engine: This setting determines what search engine is 
used by the Internet Channel’s built-in search function. The only 
options as of this writing are Google and Yahoo!, but you can 
access other search engines directly by typing in their URL using 
the Web Address option. Or, better yet, you can save your 
preferred alternative search engine as a Favorite for easy access.
 
• Delete cookies: Cookies are little digital breadcrumbs left by some 
Web sites to help identify you automatically the next time you 
visit. These cookies aren’t dangerous per se, but they can be a 
security risk if you visit some unscrupulous Web sites that try to 
search your cookies for personal data. It’s a good idea to delete 
your cookies periodically, just in case.
 
• Adjust Display: On some TVs, the Internet Channel won’t extend 
all the way to the edge of the screen. Use the Adjust Display option 
to fix. Simply click the on-screen arrows to widen or narrow the 
display until the blue borders reach all the way to the edge of your 
screen.
 
• Proxy Settings: Advanced users can use this option to set up a 
proxy server for their Web browsing. Most users (including all 
those who don’t know what a proxy server is) shouldn’t worry 
about these settings.
 
 Wii Menu: This returns you to the Wii Menu, oddly enough. Remember 
you can always return to the Wii Menu by pressing the Home button on 
the Wii Remote.
 
 Controls: Click the controller on the Start Page to get a basic overview 
of the Internet Channel’s Web page navigation controls. These controls 
are discussed in much, much greater detail in the “Web page navigation” 
section, later in this chapter.
The toolbar
At the bottom of Figure 9-1, you can see a few buttons that are not discussed 
in the list in the previous section. That’s because these buttons are not 
strictly part of the Start Page — they’re part of the toolbar that lets you 
access many of the Internet Channel’s functions quickly as you surf the Web. 
(See the preceding section for more on hiding the toolbar to get a better view 
of the Web page.) The toolbar buttons are shown and discussed in more 
detail in the following list:

151
 Chapter 9: The Internet Channel
 
 
 Back and Forward: Use these buttons to return to the last page visited 
or advance to the next page in your visitation history, respectively. 
These buttons become grayed out if there is no previous or next page in 
your history list.
 
 
 Reload: Click this button to download the latest version of the Web 
page you’re currently viewing. This is useful for getting the latest data 
from a page that’s frequently updated, or to retry a page that may have 
encountered an error on the first attempt. Note that when a page is 
actively loading, this button changes to a Stop sign. Click that stop sign 
to stop the browser from loading the current page.
 
 
 Search: Type in a search term using the on-screen keyboard to search 
the Internet for pages on a specific topic. You can toggle your preferred 
search engine using the Settings menu, as discussed in the previous 
section.
 
 
 Favorites: Opens up the Favorites menu, as discussed in the previous 
section.
 
 
 Enter Address: Brings up an on-screen keyboard where you can enter a 
Web address (also known as a URL) for any site you’d like to view. See 
the Web Address entry in the “Internet Channel Start Page” section for 
more on entering URLs on the Internet Channel.
 
 
 Start Page: Returns you to the Start Page, as discussed in the previous 
section.
 
 
 Page Information: Click this button to view general information about 
the page you’re currently viewing, as shown in Figure 9-5. The icon 
changes to a lock if the currently viewed page is encrypted.

Part II: The Channels 
Web page navigation
Even if you already know how to surf the Web with a mouse and keyboard, 
navigating Web pages on the Internet Channel may take a bit of a learning 
process. The following list discusses the variety of Remote-based shortcuts 
used to navigate around a page once it’s been loaded:
 
 Following links: Just as you find on the computer, following a link on the 
Internet Channel is a matter of pointing and clicking. When you move 
the on-screen pointer over a Web page, certain words and pictures are 
highlighted in a light blue box when you hover over them. Simply push 
the A button when hovering over such a link to be redirected to the 
linked Web page.
 
 The Remote might rumble slightly and emit a clicking noise from the 
speaker when you hover over a link. You can turn these features off 
using the Wii Remote Settings menu. (See Chapter 3 for more on how to 
find and use this menu.)
 
 Scrolling: On Web pages that don’t fit on one screen, you can use the 
directional pad on the Wii Remote to scroll the entire contents of the 
page in the desired direction. Note that some pages scroll left to right as 
well as up and down.
 
 For a quicker scroll, you can use the free scrolling option, which scrolls 
based on the direction you move the on-screen pointer. To activate free 
scrolling, point the Remote anywhere on the Web page and press and 
hold the B button. The on-screen pointer changes to a giant B button, as 
shown in Figure 9-6. While still holding B, move the pointer in any direc-
tion to scroll the Web page in that direction. The farther you move the 
pointer, the faster the page scrolls. To stop the quick scrolling, simply 
let go of the B button.

Scrolling

153
 Chapter 9: The Internet Channel
 
 Zoom: Because TVs weren’t designed to display Web pages, some sites can 
look incredibly small and blurry when viewed on your home-entertainment 
setup. Luckily, you can enlarge the text, graphics, and anything else on 
the Web page using the + button on the Wii Remote. Use the – button to 
zoom out again if you get too close — a small 100% icon briefly appears in 
the upper-right corner of the screen when you’re back to the default zoom 
level. Note that some graphics and video may look pixelated or have jagged 
edges if you zoom in too close.
 
 See the earlier section, “The Internet Channel Start Page,” for more on 
the two different styles of zooming supported by the Internet Channel.
 
 Single Column Mode: Tired of constantly zooming and scrolling from 
side to side just to see all the content on your favorite Web page? The 
Internet Channel’s single-column viewing mode can help simplify the 
display of larger, more complex Web pages. Just press the 2 button on 
the Wii Remote to show the contents of the page condensed into a single 
vertical column with blown-up text, as shown in Figure 9-7. Scrolling and 
following links work normally in this mode, but the zoom function is 
disabled. Press 2 again to go back to the default viewing mode.
 
Figure 9-7: 
A Web page 
displayed in 
the Internet 
Channel’s

column 
mode.
 
 
 On the plus side, single-column viewing mode makes it much easier to 
quickly skim a complicated Web page. On the downside, the page’s 
content is pushed out of position, ruining the intended design and 
layout. Some pages won’t display correctly at all in single-column mode. 
Use your discretion.

154
Part II: The Channels 
 
 B button shortcuts: The B button isn’t just good for quickly scrolling 
through Web pages — you can also use it to quickly access some common 
Web browsing commands. Use the following button combinations on the 
Wii Remote to bring up the noted Web-browser functions without the 
need to point and click anything on the toolbar. (Note that the directions 
listed apply to directions of the Wii Remote’s directional pad.)
 
• B+– (minus): Go to the last visited page.
 
• B++ (plus): Advance to the next page.
 
• B+↑ (up on the directional pad): Reload the current page.
 
• B+↓ (down on the directional pad): Open the Favorites menu.
 
• B+← (left on the directional pad): Open the on-screen keyboard to 
enter a Web search term.
 
• B+→ (right on the directional pad): Open the on-screen keyboard 
to enter a Website address.
 
 Search by selection: The Internet Channel’s search function is great and 
all, but it can be annoying typing in long, complex search terms using 
the on-screen keyboard. Luckily, you can use the Wii Remote to quickly 
search using any text that appears on a Web page. Just point at the 
starting point of the text you want to use as your search term, and then 
press and hold the A button. While still holding the A button, move the 
pointer to the end of your desired text — your selection is highlighted in 
blue, as shown in Figure 9-8. From here, open up a Web search using the 
button on the on-screen toolbar (or the B+← [left] shortcut discussed 
earlier). Your selected text is placed in the search box automatically! 
Click OK to perform your search.

Limitations of surfing on 
the Internet Channel
Although the Wii’s Internet Channel is a full-featured Web browser, it does 
have some limitations when compared to popular computer Web browsers 
such as Internet Explorer and Firefox:
 
 Some sites designed specifically to work with the Firefox or Internet 
Explorer browsers may not display properly on the Wii Internet Channel.
 
 The Internet Channel can’t display Adobe PDF files.
 
 The Internet Channel can’t run applets written in the Java programming 
language.
 
 The Internet Channel can’t display content written for Flash Player 
Version 8 or above. This unfortunately includes many popular Flash-
based sites, such as YouTube. Fortunately, there are some sites that get 
around this problem (see the “Must-Wii Web Sites” section).
 
 The Internet Channel can’t play movies in Windows Media (WMV), 
QuickTime (AVI), or RealPlayer formats.
 
 The Internet Channel can’t play audio in MP3 format.
 
 You can’t upload or download files using the Internet Channel.
 
 You can’t search through the contents of a specific Web page for a 
specific word or phrase using the Internet Channel.
 
 You can’t copy and paste content from a Web page into an e-mail or Web 
address using the Internet Channel.
Must-Wii Web Sites
While you can visit practically any Web page on the Internet using the Wii’s 
Internet Channel, some Web pages have been specifically designed with 
television browsing in mind. These sites can turn your Wii into a free arcade, 
a radio, a video player, and more!

Games: WiiCade
URL: www.wiicade.com
Most anyone who’s been bored while a Web-enabled computer is nearby will 
tell you that the Internet is a great place to kill some time playing free Web 
games. Put that same Internet on a system designed to play games, and the 
possibilities for time wasting grow exponentially. Amateur game developers 
have taken to the Wii’s Internet Channel in a big way, creating games 
specifically designed to take advantage of the Wii Remote.
WiiCade, shown in Figure 9-9, is the oldest and most popular hub for such 
games on the Internet. You can enjoy hundreds of free games, in genres 
ranging from action to puzzle to old-school run-and-jump-platform games, all 
specifically designed to be playable using the Wii Remote. Not all these free 
games are winners, of course, but you can harness the power of independent 
user rankings to separate the good from the bad. It’s hard to be upset with 
even the clunkers, though, considering the cost. (Did I mention they were all 
free?)

Video: MiiTube

While YouTube is great for watching short videos of dogs on skateboards and 
such, hunching over your computer desk isn’t really the ideal way to watch 
these videos. Unfortunately, sites such as YouTube aren’t really designed 
with the Wii’s Internet Channel in mind, meaning watching those amusing 
videos on your living room couch isn’t as easy as it should be. Enter MiiTube, 
a site that converts the video content on YouTube into a form that works well 
with the Wii’s Internet Channel.
The MiiTube site , shown in figure 9-10, features large, TV-friendly buttons, 
tabs for browsing featured and popular videos, and a search function to find 
videos on specific subjects. With all these free Web videos available, you may 
never watch network TV again!

Music: Finetune
URL: www.finetune.com/wii
Ever since Napster started a revolution in downloadable music, billions of 
Internet users have downloaded countless MP3s to their personal collections, 
both legally and illegally. Unfortunately, you can’t use the Wii’s Internet 
Channel to permanently download such songs for later listening. Fortunately, 
there are a few sites that let you turn the Wii into an ad-free radio station for 
the latest hits.
Finetune, shown in Figure 9-11, is by far the best-designed of these sites, 
featuring big buttons and text that’s perfect for viewing on your TV. You can 
listen to preselected mixes of everything from rock and pop to rap and country, 
or create a personalized station centered on a specific artist or keyword. Best 
of all, unlike the car radio, this player lets you skip ahead past songs you 
don’t like. Next time you have a party, forget the CDs and fire up the Wii!

Search: Clusty
URL: www.clusty.com
While the Internet Channel’s built-in Web searching capabilities are great, the 
results returned by both Google and Yahoo! were designed for viewing on 
a computer screen, not a TV. This means search results on the Wii Internet 
Channel are often too small to read and onerous to scroll through.
Web search upstart Clusty.com, shown in Figure 9-12, has attempted to solve 
this problem with a Web searching interface designed specifically for the 
Wii. Results are displayed in large, friendly letters that are easy to view on a 
normal TV screen. The site also accompanies each search with a convenient 
sidebar of links to follow-up searches on potentially related terms.

Community: MapWii

The Wii makes it relatively easy to connect with your real-life friends that 
happen to own a Wii (see Chapter 4). But what if you don’t know anyone who 
owns the system? For all its connectivity, the Wii doesn’t exactly make it easy 
to find and connect with new people to chat and play with. MapWii, shown 
in Figure 9-13, helps fix this problem. It offers a public clearinghouse for Wii 
owners to share their Friend Codes using a simple map-based interface.
 
Figure 9-13:

After you register with the site, you can search for potential friends by 
geographic location or common game interests, and then easily share your 
Friend Codes for chatting and playing together. The site’s tens of thousands 
of users also maintain a vibrant discussion forum and chat room for all things 
Wii-related and not. The site does encounter some display problems on the 
Internet Channel, but it’s by far the best place to search out new Wii owners 
to engage with.

S
o many Channels are available for the Wii, I just can’t devote an 
entire chapter to each one. The Channels discussed in this chapter 
aren’t necessarily the most popular or useful Channels, but they’re no less 
important for being squeezed together here.
Reading the News Channel
Sure, you could get the latest headlines by using the Internet Channel to head 
to your favorite news Web site (see Chapter 9). But the Wii’s News Channel 
is designed to display those headlines in a format specifically tailored for the 
Wii and your TV screen. Scanning the headlines with the News Channel is 
so simple, you may find yourself turning on the Wii instead of unfolding the 
paper with your morning coffee.
Starting up the News Channel
To access the News Channel, first you have to connect your Wii to the 
Internet through a broadband connection. You should also make sure you 
have WiiConnect24 turned on so you can download headlines automatically 
when the system is off (see Chapter 4 for more on connecting the Wii to the 

162
Part II: The Channels 
Internet and WiiConnect24). The News Channel is available on the Channel 
menu when you first start your Wii, so there’s no need to download anything 
from the Wii Shop Channel.
When you first start the News Channel, it may take a few minutes to download 
and display the latest headlines. This process takes longer the less often you 
use the Channel, so be sure to check in on current events often. When the load-
ing is done, you see the News Channel topic menu, as shown in Figure 10-1.
 
Clicking on the cat while the headlines are downloading brings up a random 
tip on using the News Channel. It also changes the loading animation to a 
group of cats. This won’t speed up the sometimes painfully long download 
process, but it is very cute.
 
If you accessed the News Channel recently and have WiiConnect24 turned 
on, you can view recent headlines scrolling on the News Channel icon from 
the Wii Menu. These headlines also available on the Channel preview screen, 
before you even fully start the Channel. (See Chapter 5 for more about the Wii 
Menu and Channel preview screens.)
 
Figure 10-1:

Scanning the headlines
Click the on-screen arrows or press the up and down buttons on the Wii 
Remote’s directional pad to scroll through the topics list. You can also hold 
down the B button and move the Wii Remote pointer up and down to scroll 
through the list. Click a topic to bring up a set of recent headlines for that 
topic, as shown in Figure 10-2.

163
 Chapter 10: News, Weather, and More
 
Figure 10-2: 
The News 
Channel

menu.
 
You can scroll through this list in the same manner as you scrolled through 
the topics list. You can also enlarge or shrink the text by clicking the buttons 
in the upper corners of the menu, or by pressing the + and – buttons on the Wii 
Remote.
A blue dot next to a headline means the story hasn’t been read yet. If that 
blue dot is blinking, the story was posted within the last hour or two. A gray 
dot means you’ve already read that story.
Clicking a headline displays the full story, as shown in Figure 10-3. Scroll 
through the text of the article by clicking the on-screen arrows or pressing the 
up and down arrows on the Wii Remote’s directional pad. You can increase or 
decrease the size of the text by clicking the buttons on the top of the menu, 
or by pressing the + and – buttons on the Wii Remote, respectively. You can 
also hold down the B button and move the Wii Remote pointer up and down to 
scroll through the story. Click the Back button to return to the headline menu, 
or press the left or right button on the Wii Remote’s directional pad to jump 
directly to another story.
Global news
When viewing a news story, click the Globe button at the lower right of the 
menu to bring up a decidedly global view of the day’s news, as shown in 
Figure 10-4. This global view gives you a visual indication of where the news 
is happening and how much of it is happening where. Controls for this view 
are described in the following list:

 View Stories: The pieces of paper on the global view each represent 
a distinct news story with a dateline from the named location on the 
globe. Click a single piece of paper to bring up the applicable story in 
the news story view described earlier. Click a stack of papers (with a 
number next to the name of the region) to bring up a list of the recent 
stories from that area in the headline view.

165
 Chapter 10: News, Weather, and More
 
 Spin the Globe: Click and hold the A button with the Wii Remote pointer 
over an empty patch of land or water to grab the globe at that point. 
Move the Remote pointer while still holding the A button to spin the 
globe in that direction. If you let go of the A button quickly, the globe 
continues spinning in that direction, just like a real globe!
 
 Zoom: Click the buttons in the upper corners of the menu or press the 
+ and – buttons on the Wii Remote to zoom the camera in and out from 
the globe. Note that as you zoom out, stories may rearrange themselves 
by region rather than specific city. For instance, a story that shows up 
as coming from Boston when zoomed in may show up as part of the 
“Washington Area” when zoomed farther out. The closer you zoom the 
view, the more tightly targeted the sets of headlines are.
 
 Tilt: Click the curved arrow buttons on the bottom of the menu or press 
the up and down buttons on the Wii Remote’s directional pad to tilt the 
camera’s view of the globe higher or lower. A lower angle makes the 
stacks of papers look like soaring towers of news, while a higher view 
makes them look flatter. Click the Restore button at the lower right 
when tilted to get back to a straight overhead view.
 
When zooming and tilting around the global view, take a moment to glance at 
the starry background on the screen: This starry night view is based on real 
astronomical data culled from NASA. (I bet you didn’t know you were getting a 
basic planetarium with your News Channel, but the Wii is nothing if not full of 
surprises.)
News slides
Tired of the simple headline view? Bored with spinning the globe? Click the 
Slide button in the lower-right corner of the headline menu to view a dynamic 
slide-show view of the headlines, as shown in Figure 10-5.
Each headline is automatically replaced by a new one every few seconds, 
or you can press the left and right buttons on the Wii Remote’s directional 
pad to scroll at your own pace. You can also use + and – buttons on the Wii 
Remote to increase and decrease, respectively, the size of the headlines.
If a headline looks interesting, press A at any time to see the entire story in a 
full screen view. When you’re done reading a story, click the Continue button 
at the lower right to go back to the slide show. When you’re done watching 
the news slide on by, click the End button in the lower left to go back to the 
basic headline view.

Weathering the Forecast Channel
Bob Dylan famously said you don’t need a weatherman to know which way 
the wind blows. For those who want more detailed weather information and 
predictions, though, consulting some form of meteorologist is probably a 
good idea. Read on for more information on how to use the Wii’s Forecast 
Channel to get the current temperature, forecasts, and global weather condi-
tions on-demand on your TV.
Setting up the Forecast Channel
To use the Forecast Channel, you first have to make sure the Wii is hooked 
up to a broadband Internet connection. The Forecast Channel is built into the 
system right out of the box, so there’s no need to download anything from 
the Wii Shop Channel.
The first time you turn the Channel on, you’re asked to confirm the current 
time and date. If either is incorrect, you’re sent back to the Wii System menu 
to correct them (see Chapter 2). You’re then asked to choose your default 
location, first by choosing your state or territory and then choosing your 
city. Only major cities are listed, so if you live in a small town, pick a larger 
city that’s close by. After you’ve chosen your state and city, confirm your 
selections by clicking Yes.

167
 Chapter 10: News, Weather, and More
The Forecast Channel menu
After you’ve gone through the initial setup, you come to the Forecast Channel 
main menu, as shown in Figure 10-6. This is the screen that appears initially 
every subsequent time you start up the Channel.
 
Figure 10-6: 
The Wii 
Forecast 
main menu.
 
This initial weather data screen shows current conditions for your area, 
but there’s more data hidden just above and below. Click the up and down 
buttons on the edges of the screen or press the up and down buttons on 
the Wii Remote’s directional pad to bring up the additional information, 
described from top to bottom in the following list:
 
 UV Index: The amount of ultraviolet radiation in the air today, measured 
on a scale from 1 (low) to 11+ (extremely high). A UV Index of 6 to 8 or 
above is considered dangerous; you should take special precautions if 
you decide to go out in such conditions.
 
 Current: The most recent temperature, weather, and wind conditions 
for your area. Weather data is updated multiple times per day; check the 
message in the lower-right corner of the screen for the time of the last 
update. This is the default view, as shown in Figure 10-6.
 
 Forecast Channel data won’t update when you’re actively using the 
Channel. To get new data, first quit out of the Channel and then start it 
up again from the Wii Menu.

168
Part II: The Channels 
 
 Today: The predicted high temperature and weather conditions for later 
in the day (or later in the night, depending on the time of day).
 
 Tomorrow: The predicted weather conditions and high temperature for 
tomorrow.
 
 Five-day Forecast: Shows predicted weather conditions and temperatures 
for the next five days. The top number is the predicted high temperature 
and the bottom one is the predicted low.
 
Weather data displayed on the Forecast Channel does not include severe 
weather warnings and watches. Consult TV or radio for updates on 
severe weather in your area.
Settings
Click the Settings button in the upper-right corner of the Forecast menu to 
bring up the Change Settings menu. Click the appropriate Change buttons to 
toggle to the following options:
 
 Closest Location: Choose a new default location for the default Weather 
data view, as described in the “Setting up the Forecast Channel” section.
 
 Temperature display: Toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius display 
for temperature data.
 
 Wind Display: Toggle between miles per hour (mph) or kilometers per 
hour (km/h) for the wind speed display.
Global view
Click Globe in the lower-right corner of the Forecast menu to bring up a 
worldwide view of the weather, as shown in Figure 10-7. Details about the 
controls for this view are described in the following list:
 
 View detailed forecast: To view more detailed weather information for a 
city, simply click the city’s name on the globe. This brings up the current 
weather information for that city, as discussed in “The Forecast Channel 
menu” section. From here you can scroll up and down to get forecasts 
and more weather information, just as you would for your default loca-
tion. When you’re done taking in this info, simply click the A button in the 
middle of the screen to return to the Global view.
 
 Zoom: Click the zoom buttons in the top corners of the menu or press 
the + and – buttons on the Wii Remote to zoom in and out of the globe. 
Note that some smaller cities are only visible when zoomed in close to the 
globe — they are subsumed by larger cities when the view is zoomed out. 
Your default location is always visible, no matter the zoom level.

 More Information: By default, the global view shows a small icon 
representing the current weather conditions next to each city name. 
You can change this display by clicking the Next button at the top of 
the screen or by pressing the left and right buttons on the Wii Remote’s 
directional pad. This cycles the displayed data through the following 
list:
 
• Current weather conditions
 
• Current temperature
 
• Today’s predicted weather conditions
 
• Today’s predicted high temperature
 
• Tomorrow’s weather conditions
 
• Tomorrow’s predicted high temperature
 
 Spin the Globe: To see other parts of the globe, click and hold the A 
button while the Wii Remote pointer is hovering over an empty spot of 
land or water. While still holding A, move the Wii Remote pointer in any 
direction to move the globe in that direction. If you let go of A quickly 
while moving the pointer, the globe continues to spin in the indicated 
direction, just like a real globe.
 
 Tilt: Tired of looking at the world from above? Click the curved arrow 
button at the bottom of the menu or press the up and down buttons on 
the Wii Remote’s directional pad to look at the world from a different 
vantage point. When in a tilted view, click the Restore button to go back 
to the view from directly above.

Canvassing the Everybody 
Votes Channel
Have you ever seen that show Family Feud, where 100 Americans are 
surveyed, and the contestants have to guess the most popular answers? 
Ever wish you could give your opinion in a survey like that? Well, with the 
Everybody Votes Channel, you can! You can even take part in a game-show 
style game to predict what answer will be most popular. It’s not quite Family 
Feud — you don’t win any cash or prizes for participating — but this hidden 
gem of the Wii’s Channel selection is still a surprising amount of fun. Read on 
for more on how to vote in polls, predict the results, and view your personal 
voting and predicting statistics.
Starting up the Everybody 
Votes Channel
First things first: To use the Everybody Votes Channel, your Wii has to be 
hooked up to the Internet through a broadband connection. You also have 
to download the Everybody Votes Channel from the Channels area of the Wii 
Shop Channel (see Chapter 6). The Everybody Votes Channel doesn’t cost 
any money and doesn’t take up much space on your Wii’s internal memory, 
so there’s really no reason not to try it out. Remember, if you don’t like it, 
you can always delete it later.
The first time you start the Everybody Votes Channel, you need to confirm 
the general region you live in. This is the region you set up when going 
through the Wii System menu. If the region is correct, click OK. Otherwise, 
choose No to be taken back to the Wii System menu to choose a new region 
(described in Chapter 2). You’re also asked to confirm your selected 
language from an on-screen list.
After your region and language settings are confirmed, you need to choose at 
least one Mii to represent you in the online voting. The Miis available in your 
Mii Plaza are displayed on-screen, ten at a time. Click the on-screen arrows 
to scroll through the selection of Miis, and then click your preferred Mii to 
choose him or her. Click Yes and then OK to confirm.
If more than one person uses the Channel, you can register more Miis at this 
time — just click Yes when asked and then repeat the steps in the previous 
paragraph. You can register up to six total Miis as voters on the Everybody 

171
 Chapter 10: News, Weather, and More
Votes Channel at any one time. You can always add more voters later, so 
don’t worry if you’re not sure if the rest of your family will want to join in on 
the fun (they probably will, if my experience is any indication).
Voting
After the initial setup, you’re taken to the Everybody Votes Channel main 
menu, as shown in Figure 10-8. This is also the first screen that’s shown on 
subsequent uses of the Channel.
 
Figure 10-8: 
The 
Everybody 
Votes 
Channel 
main menu.
 
For now, just ignore the top row of options and focus on the tabs/circles just 
below it. Specifically, the first two on the left — Active Polls and Worldwide 
Polls — are the ones that let you express your opinion on the hot-button 
issues of the day (like how many times a day you brush your teeth, to take 
one recent example). These tabs are labeled as “New!” if there are new 
questions to respond to. Click either of these tabs to see a list of the three 
most recent active-poll questions available, and then click the poll question 
itself to bring up the Voting menu, as shown in Figure 10-9.
 
The Everybody Votes Channel only shows three Active Polls and one 
Worldwide Poll at a time. If you don’t vote before a poll closes, you won’t be 
able to go back and add your thoughts — it’s gone for good. New polls come 
up regularly every other day, so be sure to visit the Everybody Votes Channel 
frequently. As Al Capone used to say: Vote early, vote often!

172
Part II: The Channels 
 
Figure 10-9: 
The 
Everybody 
Votes

ing screen.
 
On the Voting menu, any of your registered Miis that haven’t yet voted are 
shown in the center of the teal voting circle. To place a vote for that Mii, 
first pick that Mii up by pointing the Wii Remote pointer at it and pressing 
and holding the A and B buttons on the Wii Remote simultaneously. While 
still holding A and B, drag the Mii over to the semicircle for your preferred 
choice. Let go of the buttons on the Remote to place the Mii in that voting 
area.
After you’ve placed any number of registered Miis in this manner, click the 
Vote! button at the bottom of the screen and then click Yes to officially 
confirm your vote (or votes). The voting Miis’ shirts change to the color 
of the option they picked, indicating that their vote is locked and can’t be 
changed. You can leave some Miis undecided for now, but remember: When a 
poll is done, it’s done for good.
Predictions
After you make your personal vote comes the fun part — predicting which 
option will get the most votes overall. Click the Yes button when the on-
screen prompt asks you if you want to “predict the response that will get 
the most votes.” You don’t have to do this if you’re in a hurry, of course, but 
you’re missing out on the best part of the Channel if you click No. I’m just 
saying . . . 

173
 Chapter 10: News, Weather, and More
The Miis that just voted run back to the center of the blue voting platform 
under the question “Which will be more popular?” Make your prediction by 
picking up your Mii with the A and B buttons and placing him or her in the 
appropriate semicircle (as described in the “Voting” section). After placing 
all voting Miis, click the Predict! button and then click Yes to register your 
predictions. Each Mii raises up a small, colored sign to indicate which option 
he or she predicted would be more popular. You’re then taken back to the 
Everybody Votes Channel main menu.
Results
If you’ve already cast a vote or two, you’re ready to move on to the rightmost 
two circles on the main menu: the Recent Results and Poll History tabs. The 
former allows access to the most recently concluded regional and international 
polls, while the latter contains archives of up to 12 more recently concluded 
polls (click the on-screen arrows to scroll through the list). These tabs are 
labeled with New! if there are any unviewed results to peruse.
Click the name of a poll question under either of these tabs to bring up the 
Results screen, as shown in Figure 10-10. First your Miis’ picks and predictions 
will be recapped via the same colored shirts and signs discussed in the previous 
sections. After this, a drumroll and spotlight accompany a bunch of tiny Miis 
running in to fill in a pie chart, which shows the percentage results for the poll. 
Click the Skip button at the lower right to get past this rigamarole quickly.

After the results are up on the screen, you can click the icons at the lower 
right to get more information about voting patterns. Click the icon that looks 
like a piece of paper to view results split by gender and to see how accurate 
respondents were in their predictions. Click the scroll icon to see how the 
poll results broke down by state: The darker a state’s color, the stronger that 
state’s results broke in favor of that colored option.
For worldwide polls, click the globe icon to view a bar graph ranking of how 
each country responded to the poll. Click the on-screen arrows or press the 
up and down buttons on the Wii Remote’s directional pad to scroll through 
this list of countries. Click Rearrange to order the countries by a different 
method, including their prediction accuracy.

they are:
 
 Register New Voter: Add more Miis to that central blue voting circle. 
The process for registering new Miis is exactly the same as the one 
discussed in the “Starting up the Everybody Votes Channel” section.
 
 Voter Data: What good is all this voting and predicting if you can’t keep 
track of who’s actually winning? The Voter Data option lets you track 
your progress in the Everybody Votes Channel.
 
 First, click a registered Mii to bring up a screen tallying his or her vote 
count and prediction win/loss record. Click the right arrow on-screen 
to bring up the How Tuned In Are You? screen, a highly unscientific 
measure of your character traits based on how your votes gibe with 
those of others. Click the right arrow again to view the equally 
unscientific Distance from Popular Opinion screen, which measures 
how often you agree with the majority. The more pedestrian your 
personal picks, the shorter the distance.
 
 Click Close to go back to the Mii selection menu, or simply click a Mii 
on the left side of the screen to bring up his or her data without backing 
out. When you’re done viewing voter data, click the Back button to get 
back to the main menu.
 
 Incidentally, the Voter Data screen is also where you go to unregister 
a voter who’s been signed up for the Channel. Click the Mii as normal, 
and then click the Erase button in the upper-left corner of the screen. 
Confirm your selection, but be careful — when you unregister a voter, 
all that Mii’s accumulated voting and prediction data is lost forever.

 Suggest a question: Got a burning desire to know whether Wii owners 
prefer peas to carrots? Maybe you want to know if more Wii owners use 
a car or ride a bike to work or school? Suggest one of these or your own 
(doubtless better) questions to Nintendo and maybe it will get asked on 
the Everybody Votes Channel.
 
 To suggest a question, click the question and answer area of this 
submenu to bring up an on-screen keyboard where you can enter your 
question and two responses.
 
 Your question can have only two responses, so don’t ask anything too 
open-ended. Keep it family-friendly and be sure to check your spelling 
before clicking the Send button to submit your question.
 
 Options: Brings up a submenu with the following options:
 
• Confirm Polling Region: Confirms your polling region. Click 
Change Your Polling Region to be taken to the Wii System menu, 
where you can change your Wii’s region.
 
• Erase All Data: Be careful! This option unregisters all currently 
registered voters and erases their voting and prediction history for 
good. Think long and hard before clicking the Yes button to 
confirm this drastic step. Think of the children!
 
• Change Question Language: Get questions in English, French, or 
Spanish.
 
 Wii Menu: Return to the Wii Menu to await further questioning. 
Remember, you can return to the Wii Menu at any time by pressing the 
Home button on the Wii Remote.
Getting Informed with 
the Nintendo Channel
There are plenty of ways to keep informed about new games for your Wii 
(see Chapter 11 for but a few) but there’s only one way to stream videos and 
information about the latest games directly from Nintendo to your Wii. The 
Nintendo Channel is basically a giant Nintendo marketing zone on your Wii, 
providing video trailers and advertisements along with basic information 
about Wii games right on your TV screen. There are some interesting features 
to the Channel, though, such as interviews with game developers and 
downloadable demos for your Nintendo DS. Read on for more information on 
navigating this treasure-trove of marketing information.

176
Part II: The Channels 
Starting up the Nintendo Channel
Before getting into the Nintendo Channel, you need to connect your Wii to 
the Internet via a broadband connection. Then you have to download the 
Channel itself from the Channels area of the Wii Shop Channel (see Chapter 
6). The Nintendo Channel is free, and worth a look even if you’re not 
particularly interested in watching Nintendo advertisements.
When you first start the Nintendo Channel from the Wii Menu, the Channel 
downloads and plays the latest Digest Video summarizing the latest products 
and videos on the Nintendo Channel service. You can watch this video using 
the control discussed in the following section, “Viewing videos,” or click the 
To The Video List button to jump right to the video list, as shown in Figure 
10-11. Scroll through the pages of the list by clicking the on-screen arrows or 
pressing the left and right buttons on the Wii Remote’s directional pad. Click 
a video name to view that video.

Video List.
 
Viewing videos
Click the name of a video from the Video List menu to play that video on 
your TV, as shown in Figure 10-12. These videos are streamed directly from 
Nintendo’s servers, so there may be a slight downloading delay before the 
video starts.

 Chapter 10: News, Weather, and More
 
Figure 10-12: 
Watching a 
video on the 
Nintendo 
Channel.
 
After the video starts playing, click the video image itself to expand the video 
further to a full-screen view, or click the Back button in the lower-left corner 
to reduce the video to thumbnail size and return to the Video List menu. 
Click the Pause button to stop playback temporarily; click the Play button 
that appears in its place to resume the playback.
 
While watching a Nintendo Channel video, hold down the B button to bring 
up a slider showing your current position in the video playback. While still 
holding B, move the Wii Remote pointer to move the slider and let go of B to 
jump to that position in the video.
 
If videos are taking too long to download and start playing, there may be a 
problem with your Wii’s Internet connection. Try restarting the Channel and/
or the system to see if the problem improves. If not, you might be better off 
just using your computer to view the similar information available on www.
nintendo.com.
Viewing game information
When you’re viewing a video, click the More Information button to bring up 
a page containing more information about the featured game, oddly enough. 
The top part of such an information page is shown Figure 10-13. Scroll down 
the page by clicking the on-screen arrows, by pressing the up and down 
buttons on the Wii Remote’s directional pad, or by clicking the menu buttons 
at the right side of the screen, as shown in the figure.

Each game information page can have some or all of the sections described 
in the following list:
 
 Basic information: Review the basics about the game in question, 
including the supported controllers, ESRB Rating, genre, number of 
players, and more. Click the Purchase button to go to the Internet 
Channel (for disc-based games) or the Wii Shop Channel (for down-
loadable games) where you can buy that game directly. After making 
your purchase (or just browsing), you have to leave the new Channel 
and restart the Nintendo Channel to get back to where you were.
 
 Videos: A list of all available Nintendo Channel videos about the current 
game. Click a video name to view the video, as described in the “Viewing 
videos” section. Click the Back button to return to the game information 
page.
 
 Recommended Games: For some games, the Nintendo Channel 
recommends other games you may like, basing their guess on the usage 
patterns and recommendations of other Nintendo Channel users. Click 
the name of a recommended game to go to the information page for that 
game.
 
 What people are saying . . .: This section graphs the recommendations 
of other Nintendo Channel users for this game (see the section, “Find 
titles for you”). This includes whether the game is better for hardcore 
or casual gamers and whether the game is more fun with friends or 
played alone. Hover over a graph with the Wii Remote pointer to see the 
answers and percentages for a specific question. Click the Filter Results 
button to narrow down the results to a specific age group or gender.

179
 Chapter 10: News, Weather, and More
 
 Time Spent Playing/Times Played: Shows how popular the game is 
among people who decide to share gameplay data with Nintendo (see 
the “Settings” section, later in this chapter). Hours measures total 
number of hours data-sharing players have put into the game. Times 
measures how many distinct times data-sharing players have turned on 
the game (limit one per system per day). The Per Person numbers for 
each statistic average out the results over all the people sharing data. 
Remember this is a self-selected sample, so this data might not be 
indicative of how popular the game is among Wii owners as a whole.
 
 Related Titles: A selection of games that are related to the currently 
viewed game by series, character, or genre. Click a game name to bring 
up the information page for that game.
 
 Web Page: A list of some Web pages associated with the game. Click 
any of the listed Web page names to open up that page in the Internet 
Channel.
Find titles for you
Instead of just browsing around the videos on the Video List menu, you can 
look for videos of specific games by clicking the Find Titles For You button. 
This brings up a submenu with the following options:
 
 View New Titles: Click this option to bring up a list of titles that have 
been released recently or that will be released in the near future. This 
list initially includes titles for all Nintendo systems, including the 
Nintendo DS. Click the All Platforms button in the upper-right corner; 
then click the Wii button that pops up to restrict the results to Wii 
games. You can also choose to view only WiiWare or Virtual Console 
games.
 
 Search by Category: Click this option to bring up another submenu letting 
you choose a variety of filters for your game listings, including publisher, 
genre, recommendation status (see the Make a Recommendation bullet), or 
more. Click a filtering option, and then choose the desired criteria from the 
list that pops up. When all your options are set, click Search to bring up a 
list of games matching your search criteria. Click a game name on this list 
to get more information about the game (see the earlier section, “Viewing 
game information”).
 
 Search by Name: Click this option to bring up the on-screen keyboard, 
where you can type in all or part of the name of the game you want more 
information on. (Remember: Spelling counts, so only type in the part of 
the title you’re sure you know how to spell.)

180
Part II: The Channels 
 
 Make a Recommendation: Click this option to bring up a list of Wii 
games and Channels you’ve played for at least an hour. Click a game 
or Channel name to go through a series of questions about your experi-
ence with the game, including your gender and age, how much you 
generally enjoyed the game, and whom you think the game is best 
suited for. Use the Wii Remote pointer to answer all the questions, 
and then click Register to add your opinion to the Nintendo Channel’s 
recommendations.
 
 DS Download Service: If you have a Nintendo DS, you can click this 
option to download trial versions of Nintendo DS software through 
your Wii. Note that you have to sign up for the Nintendo Channel’s data 
sharing service before you can use the DS Download service (see the 
“Settings” section later in this chapter).
 
 Here’s how the DS Download Service works:
 
1. Choose DS Download Service from the Find Titles for You menu.
 
2. Choose the game demo you want to download from the list.
 
 This brings up a screen that says Preparing. When this message 
changes to Transmitting (as shown in Figure 10-14), proceed to the 
next step. This process can take a few minutes, so be patient.
 
3. Turn on your Nintendo DS.
 
4. On the Nintendo DS, tap DS Download Play.

5. On the Nintendo DS, tap the name of the demo, and then tap Yes 
to confirm the download.
 
 A message on the DS says that the demo is downloading. After a 
few seconds, the game demo should appear on the DS screen.
 
6. Play the demo.
 
 After the demo has started, you can click the Back button on the 
Wii to go back to the demo list, or click Information to get more 
information about the game.
 
 When you’re done with the demo, just turn off the Nintendo DS. 
Note that the demo is not permanently saved to your Nintendo DS, 
so you have to download it again from the Wii if you want to try it 
another time.
Settings
Click the wrench icon in the upper-left corner of the Video List menu to 
access the following options through a submenu:
 
 Video Volume: Change the volume at which Nintendo Channel videos 
are played. Click the on-screen arrows to move the volume setting up 
and down. Of course, you can just use your television remote to change 
the volume as well.
 
 Commercial Message Settings: The Nintendo Channel can occasionally 
send information about new games or products to your Wii Message 
Board. If you want this kind of information sent to your system peri-
odically, click the Opt In to Commercial Messages From This Channel 
button. Otherwise click the Opt Out button.
 
 Data Sharing Settings: The Nintendo Channel has the ability to collect 
information on what games you play and how often you play them. This 
data is used to compile region-wide gameplay statistics for many games. 
Don’t worry — this data is anonymous and can’t be tied back to you in 
any way. Click I Agree (to share the data) or I Disagree (to stop sharing).
 
 You need to agree to data sharing in order to access DS Game Downloads.
 
 About Nintendo Channel: Read more about the Nintendo Channel.
 
 How Your Information Is Used: Read more about how Nintendo uses 
the data you agree to share in the Data Sharing Settings. To summarize 
all the legalese and technical stuff here, Nintendo basically collects 
data on what games you play and how long you play them, as well as 
how you’ve set your Wii’s System Settings. This data is all anonymous; 
it’s not identifiable with you personally, but Nintendo may use it in the 
aggregate — whether for internal market research purposes or publicly 
to make game recommendations.

182
Part II: The Channels 
Getting Specific with Game-Specific 
Channels
While the games portion and the Channels portion of the Wii tend to 
keep a respectable distance from each other, a couple of Channels are 
specifically designed to work with certain disc-based games. These 
game-specific Channels can be run even when the associated game disc 
isn’t in the system, providing some basic, gamelike functionality even if 
the game is buried at the bottom of your toy chest.
The following sections give you some basic information about these Channels, 
which can be installed onto your Wii Menu directly from the game disc. 
Consult the instruction manual for the games for more detailed information on 
using these Channels.
Mario Kart Channel
To install the Mario Kart Channel from the Mario Kart Wii disc, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Start up Mario Kart Wii using the Disc Channel.
 
2. Press A to advance to the License menu.
 
3. Click the Settings icon.
 
 This icon can be found in the upper-right corner of the screen.
 
4. Click Install Channel.
 
5. Click OK, and then click Install.
 
 The system quits to the Wii Menu and displays a somewhat cryptic 
“Save to Wii System Memory” message. Click OK once more to start the 
installation. The progress bar should fill up in a matter of seconds.
The Mario Kart Channel is now installed. You’re returned to the game for 
now, but the next time you go to the Wii Menu, the Mario Kart Channel will 
be ready to go.
 
This Channel takes up 79 blocks on your Wii’s internal memory (see Chapter 5 
for more on memory management).

183
 Chapter 10: News, Weather, and More
The Mario Kart Channel lets you monitor the online happenings in the Mario 
Kart Wii universe without having the game disc in the system. If your Wii is 
hooked up to the Internet, you can use the Channel to register new Mario Kart 
Wii friends, see if currently registered friends are online, or view how your time 
trial results measure up in the worldwide rankings. Of course, to actually race 
against your friends or their downloaded ghost data, you need to put the game 
disc in the system.
Wii Fit Channel
To install the Wii Fit Channel from the Wii Fit disc, follow these steps:
 
1. Start up Wii Fit using the Disc Channel.
 
2. Click the Settings icon.
 
 This icon can be found in the upper-right corner of the screen.
 
3. Click Install Channel.
 
4. Click OK, and then click Install.
 
 The system quits to the Wii Menu and display a somewhat cryptic 
“Save to Wii System Memory” message. Click OK once more to start the 
installation. The progress bar should fill up in a matter of seconds.
The Wii Fit Channel is now installed. You’re returned to the game for now, 
but the next time you go to the Wii Menu the Channel will be ready to go.
 
Note that the Wii Fit Channel takes up 109 blocks on your Wii’s internal 
memory (see Chapter 5 for more on memory management).
The Wii Fit Channel menu looks a lot like the Wii Fit Plaza (as discussed in 
Chapter 13), so it’s not too surprising that most every function of the Wii Fit 
Plaza is available on the Wii Fit Channel. This includes viewing a graph of 
your daily exercise progress, performing a basic Body Test, and receiving 
your daily BMI and Wii Fit Age rankings. You can even jump into your daily 
training exercises, if the Wii Fit disc is in the system. Even if the disc is far, far 
away, the Wii Fit Channel is a great way to do your daily weigh-in and Body 
Test without a lot of hassle.

fter reading about all those Channels in Part II, you’d 
be forgiven if you momentarily forgot that the Wii 
was primarily designed to play video games. Well, this 
part will help remind you. First you discover how to pick 
out games that are right for you and your family. Then 
you figure out the ins and outs of two of the most popular 
games on the system, Wii Sports and Wii Fit. This part 
finishes up with a quick description of 15 great games 
designed for all sorts of situations.

W
alking into a video-game store for the first time can be a scary and 
baffling prospect. Rows and rows of largely identical-looking games, 
packaging that stresses flashy graphics over gameplay, and retail employees 
trained to cater to hardcore gamers can make choosing a game at the store 
a risky move. A $50 video game that you’ll be playing for dozens of hours 
shouldn’t be an impulse buy. You have to do your research to make sure 
you’re not getting a lemon.
Of course, you could skip all that research and just head over to Chapter 14 
for a list of recommended games for a variety of situations. As time goes on, 
though, and that list gets out of date, you’ll eventually want to know how to 
pick out appropriate games for yourself. That’s where this chapter comes in. 
Read on to find out more about the major genres of video games, the industry-
standard content-rating system, good sites to consult for independent reviews, 
and tips for getting more games for less money.
Checking the Genre
Anyone who’s watched a movie knows there’s a huge difference between a 
summer blockbuster and an independent art-house flick. Similarly, games 
range from fast-action thrill-fests to more contemplative puzzle games. The 
first step to deciding whether or not to buy a game is determining whether its 
genre is a good fit for your tastes.

188
Part III: The Games 
In the following list, I provide some of the most common video-game genres, 
along with a brief description of the games that fall into each genre. When 
you come across a genre you like, look for games that fit that genre on the 
Nintendo Web site (www.nintendo.com) or in your perusal of reviews (see 
the following section). Or you can simply ask about that specific genre at 
your local game retailer.
 
 Action/Adventure: Probably the most overcrowded genre in all of 
gaming, action/adventure games are those that focus on fast-paced 
thrills (the “action”) and/or exploration (the “adventure”). Action games 
tend to require quick reflexes and have a lot of on-screen action, so new 
players may find these games difficult to play.
 
 That said, some action games are specifically designed to be easy for 
anyone to pick up and play (such as Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga). 
Remember to check the box for an ESRB Rating, because many action 
games have excessive violence and other content that might not be 
appropriate for young children. (See the section on family-friendly adven-
ture games in Chapter 14 for some recommended games in this genre.)
 
 Fighting: Games in this genre focus on individual or group combat 
between fighters, to the exclusion of pretty much all else. As of press 
time, the Wii library is notably lacking in fighting games, save for one 
major exception: Super Smash Bros. Brawl. This game features familiar 
characters from across Nintendo’s history battling in frenetic, accessible 
battles that support up to four players at once. Outside of that, fighting 
game fans might want to look for classic fighting games such as Street 
Fighter II or Eternal Champions on the Wii Shop Channel (see Chapter 6).
 
 Life Training: A relatively new genre, Life Training games combine 
entertainment with personal betterment. This includes games such 
as Wii Fit (see Chapter 13), which exercises your body or Big Brain 
Academy: Wii Degree (see Chapter 14), which exercises your mind. The 
selection of Wii games in this genre is somewhat limited as of this 
writing, but look for it to take off in the near future.
 
 Party: As the name implies, party games are designed to be played in a 
group setting. While most party games have a single-player mode, the 
focus of the design is on multi-player carousing. Many party games are 
simply collections of mini-games that can be played in bite-size chunks 
of a few minutes apiece — ideal for the short attention span of a group 
setting. The quality of party games can vary wildly, with many companies 
trying to cash in with shoddy, quickly developed products. Even a bad 
game can be fun with the right friends, though. (See Chapter 14 for some 
party games that deliver on their promise of group fun.)
 
 Puzzle: This wide-ranging genre name is applied to games that generally 
require contemplative thought to solve in-game puzzles. These can 
range from destruction-fests such as Boom Blox to reflex tests such as 
Mercury Meltdown Revolution to point-and-click adventure games such as 
Zack and Wiki: The Quest for Barbaros’ Treasure. Any game can fit in this 
genre, as long as it taxes your brain.

189
 Chapter 11: Picking Out Games
 
 Racing: Not surprisingly, this genre includes games that require driving 
around a course faster than the other players (human or computer). 
Racing games can range from relatively realistic simulations such as MX 
vs. ATV Untamed to totally off-the-wall games that involve fantastical 
characters and elaborate weaponry such as Mario Kart Wii. Many racing 
games on the Wii let you use the Wii Remote as a makeshift steering 
wheel, turning the entire controller in your hands as you would a real 
steering wheel.
 
 Role-playing: Technically this category includes any game that asks you 
to play a role. Role-playing games (or RPGs) tend to focus on elaborate, 
epic storylines told over many hours of gameplay. They typically involve 
turn-based battles with elaborate enemies and require you to manage a 
wide array of personal statistics and equipment to make your characters 
the best they can be. Generally, these games aren’t great for quick, pick-
up-and-play gaming sessions; they should be reserved for when you 
have a long period of time to devote to becoming engulfed in an entire 
world.
 
 Rhythm/Music: This genre includes games that turn on the player’s 
musical and/or rhythmic ability. These can range from games that use 
the Wii Remote to tap out a quick beat, such as Battle of the Bands, to 
games that come packaged with their own musical controllers to 
measure the player’s musical abilities, such as Rock Band.
 
 Sports: Games that simulate real world sports on your TV. As with racing 
games, these can range from accurate, lifelike depictions of popular 
sports (Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08, Top Spin 3) to games that stretch the 
definition of the sport with outlandish characters and superhuman 
abilities (Super Swing Golf, Sega Superstars Tennis). Usually one look at the 
box art is enough to tell one group from the other.
Beware the box
While the front of the box is what usually gets 
your attention in a store, flipping that box over 
can give you a better idea of what a game is 
actually like. As opposed to the front of the 
box, which usually includes highly stylized art 
designed to catch your eye, the back of the box 
usually includes descriptive text and represen-
tative screenshots of what a game will actually 
look like on your TV.
Of course, this text and these screenshots are 
created by the publisher to make the game 
look as good as possible, so it’s still a good 
idea to consult some reviews for independent 
confirmation before you go to the store (see 
the “Reading Reviews” section). That said, 
the back of the box can provide an extra bit of 
confirmation that a specific game is actually 
what you’re looking for.
While you’re perusing the back of the box, 
remember to check the icon in the upper-right 
corner that indicates which controllers the 
game supports (see Chapter 3). Also be sure 
to check the lower-left corner for the game’s 
ESRB rating (refer to Figure 11-1).

190
Part III: The Games 
 
 Strategy & Simulation: A wide-ranging genre covering everything from 
realistic war simulations to wacky courtroom dramas, from tense 
medical dramas to relaxing scuba-diving trips under the sea.
 
If you’re running low on new Wii games that fall into your preferred genre, 
remember that the Wii can also play games designed for the Nintendo 
GameCube. There also might be games in your preferred genre listed for 
download from the Wii Shop Channel (see Chapter 6).
Checking the Ratings
Games aren’t just kid stuff anymore. Since the arcade heyday of Pac-Man and 
Donkey Kong, video gaming has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry, 
with content catering to everyone from preschoolers to adults. Just as you 
wouldn’t let a young child go to an R-rated movie, you shouldn’t let him or 
her play an M-rated game.
Fortunately, a large majority of the games available for the Wii are appropriate 
for even relatively young children (see sidebar, “Are game ratings effective?”). 
That said, you still have to be vigilant to make sure your children aren’t play-
ing anything meant for those outside their age range. That means checking the 
packaging for a rating before you buy the game. It also means reviewing the 
ESRB warning displayed on-screen before downloading a game from the Wii 
Shop Channel (see Chapter 6). The following sections give you all the 
information you need to review these ratings effectively.
 
The Wii has built-in parental controls to make sure your children can’t play 
inappropriate games on your system. (See Chapter 2 for more on setting up 
parental controls.)
How games are rated
Console video games are rated in the United States by the Entertainment 
Software Rating Board, a group created by the Entertainment Software 
Association trade group. Ratings are assigned by a panel of at least three 
specially trained adults (mostly parents) whose identities are kept strictly 
secret. These panelists watch a video of “all pertinent content” in a game 
before its release to determine what ages that content is appropriate for. 
Raters may also sit in on a play session led by an experienced gamer and 
review the responses to a questionnaire on the contents of the game before 
making their ratings determination.

191
 Chapter 11: Picking Out Games
Other regions have their own game rating systems, including the British 
Board of Film Classification (England), the Pan-European Game Information 
system (Europe), and the Office of Film and Literature Classification 
(Australia).
Games ratings explained
The Entertainment Software Rating Board groups all games released for the 
Wii in the United States into one of the following six categories:
 
 EC — Early Childhood: Assigned to games suitable for children aged 
three or older, according to the ESRB. EC-rated games are the friendliest 
of the friendly, with absolutely no potentially controversial material. 
These are usually educational games, targeted at small children or 
toddlers. As of this writing, there are no EC-rated games available for 
the Wii.
 
 E — Everyone: Assigned to games with content suitable for ages six and 
older. E-rated titles are roughly equivalent to G-rated movies; they may 
contain minimal cartoon, fantasy, or mild violence and/or infrequent use 
of mild language, according to the ESRB. Generally this kind of content 
won’t be anything worse than you would see in a Looney Tunes cartoon. 
Still, it might be too much for extremely young children.
 
 E10+ — Everyone 10+: As the name suggests, the E10+ rating is 
assigned to games containing content that’s suitable for children 
ten years of age and older, according to the ESRB. E10+-rated games 
are roughly equivalent to PG-rated movies; they may contain mild 
language or cartoon/fantasy violence. The difference between E and 
E10+ is usually a question of degree — the more violence and/or 
rough language contained in a game, the more likely it will get the 
E10+ rating. Be sure to check the content descriptors for more on 
why exactly the rating was assigned.
 
 T — Teen: Assigned to games suitable for ages 13 and older. T-rated 
titles are roughly equivalent to PG-13-rated movies; they may contain 
violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, minimal blood, simulated 
gambling, and/or infrequent use of strong language, according to the 
ESRB. In general, violence in a T-rated game is slightly more realistic and 
gory than similar violence in an E or E10+-rated game.
 
 M — Mature: Assigned to games with content suitable for people 17 
and older. M-rated titles are roughly equivalent to R-rated movies; they 
may contain intense violence, blood and gore, sexual content, and/or 
strong language, according to the ESRB. This includes games with 
extremely realistic depictions and violence and gore that might be 
disturbing to children. Most retailers voluntarily refuse to sell M-rated 
games to unaccompanied minors, and some stores don’t carry 
M-rated games at all (see the sidebar, “Are game ratings effective?”).

192
Part III: The Games 
 
 AO — Adults Only: Assigned to games with content that is unsuitable 
for children under 18. AO-rated games are roughly equivalent to NC-17-
rated movies; they usually include strong sexual content or very extreme 
graphic violence. The rating is given out very rarely and only for the 
most extreme cases of sex and/or violence in games. Nintendo has 
pledged to block the release of any game that receives an AO rating on 
the Wii. As such, there are no AO games for the Wii as of this writing.
Content descriptors
ESRB ratings aren’t just limited to the ratings described in the previous 
section. Each rating also comes with a more detailed description of the 
specific types of potentially objectionable content in the title. These content 
descriptors are displayed prominently along with the letter rating on the back 
of the box, as shown in Figure 11-1, and can include everything from “mild 
comic mischief” to “strong sexual content.”
Don’t just disregard this important information. A T-rated game with “crude 
humor” or “strong language” can be very different from another T-rated game 
with “minimal blood” or “violence” descriptors. The content descriptors can 
help you distinguish a title that might be inappropriate for your child from 
one that should be just fine.
For a full explanation of all these descriptors, as well as a searchable 
database of all ESRB ratings, visit www.esrb.org.
Are game ratings effective?
It’s important to remember that even though 
the game industry has widely adopted the 
ESRB’s rating system, the ratings don’t have 
the force of law. No state or local government 
currently has any restrictions on what types of 
games can be bought or sold to minors, and 
attempts at such legislation have routinely been 
overturned on constitutional grounds.
That said, most major retailers voluntarily 
enforce ESRB ratings by refusing to sell 
M-rated games to children under 17 years of 
age. Other retailers go even further by agreeing 
not to carry M-rated games in their stores at 
all. Of course, enforcement isn’t perfect. A 
2008 “secret shopper” study conducted by the 
FTC found that children aged 13 to 16 could 
purchase M-rated games nearly 20 percent 
of the time. And even if your child can’t buy a 
game, he or she might be able to play it at a 
friend’s house.
As of this writing, there are there are no 
AO-rated games and only 13 M-rated titles 
mixed in among the Wii’s 200+ game library. In 
contrast, nearly half of the current Wii game 
library is rated E10+ or younger, meaning the 
large majority of games for the system will be 
appropriate for a large majority of the gaming 
audience. So there are really only a handful 
of Wii games a watchful parent has to keep an 
eye on.

ESRB CONTENT RATING
www.esrb.org
 
The ESRB doesn’t rate the online portions of video games, instead issuing a 
blanket warning that “online interactions are not rated by the ESRB.” This means 
that even if a game is rated E, your children could be subjected to adult language 
or inappropriate content by other players when playing online. Most Wii games 
have extremely limited chat functions, but children could still be exposed to the 
occasional crude username or other inappropriate content that can slip through 
during online play. (See Chapter 2 for more on turning on the Wii’s parental 
controls to limit your children’s access to this potentially harmful content.)
Other rating sources
While the ESRB rating is a great source of information for appropriate game 
content, some parents may want a second opinion before going into the store. 
The following Web sites can provide more information on a game’s content:
 
 What They Play (www.whattheyplay.com): A site that takes a parent’s-
eye look at the gaming industry as a whole. In addition to parent-centric 
game reviews and features targeted at gaming neophytes, What They Play 
uses reader polls to determine age ratings that might be more accurate and 
precise than those given by the ESRB. In general, the site is a great resource 
for parents looking to learn more about the favorite hobby for a large 
segment of today’s youth.
 
 Common Sense Media (www.commonsensemedia.org): An independent, 
not-for-profit group, Common Sense Media offers detailed game reviews with 
a focus on age-appropriateness. They also give their own ESRB-style ratings 
that slice the gaming landscape into content appropriate for each year of a 
child’s age, from 2 through 17. The site also reviews TV, movies, and music, 
making it a one-stop shop for parents concerned about youth media.
 
 Gaming with Children (www.gamingwithchildren.com): Run by well-
respected game journalist Andrew “GamerDad” Bub, this site covers myriad 
issues surrounding parenting and gaming, providing general information on 
the sometimes confusing game industry and answering reader questions in a 
useful column. While the site doesn’t contain a comprehensive reviews 
section, it’s still an invaluable resource for parents who might just be 
wading into the strange world of “interactive entertainment.”

194
Part III: The Games 
Reading Reviews
While the ESRB and other content rating organizations detailed previously in 
this chapter tells you if a game is age-appropriate, they don’t give you much 
information as to whether or not a game is actually any good. Although 
personal taste is highly subjective and everyone’s definition of a good game 
is different, there are some generally agreed-upon standards for what makes 
a quality title, including these:
 
 Controls: Probably the most important element of a game, the controls 
determine how easily your personal twiddling with the Remote and 
Nunchuk (or other controller) relate to the on-screen action. If the con-
trols aren’t intuitive and responsive, the game is going to be hard to 
salvage, no matter how good the other aspects are. Some controls may 
start out difficult but get easier with time. Others may seem all right at 
first, but fall short of offering fine enough control for complex maneu-
vers later in the game. Any review worth its salt will detail how the con-
trols hold up, so read carefully.
 
 Graphics: Does the game have a pleasing aesthetic and generally 
consistent art direction? Note that a game’s graphics don’t necessarily 
have to be lifelike or realistic to be “good” — some of the best graphics 
can be the least realistic. You can read about graphics in reviews, but 
you can also judge them for yourself using online screenshot and movie 
galleries that accompany those reviews.
 
 Length: Games are expensive, so they generally need to be able to 
sustain themselves for at least a few hours to justify a purchase. A story-
heavy game that reaches its conclusion after only five or six hours might 
feel like a rip-off, no matter how good it is. That said, just because a 
game is long doesn’t mean it’s worth the money. Even if a review notes 
that a game has “hundreds of hours of unique content,” it doesn’t matter 
if all that content sounds boring and derivative.
 
 On a related note, some games are good for picking up and playing in small 
bursts; others are better suited for hours-long play sessions. The former 
group of games might not be good for gamers who like to get lost in an 
experience, but the latter group might be hard to fit into a busy schedule.
 
 Multiplayer: Even the worst games tend to be redeemed somewhat 
if you can play them with a good group of friends. In fact, sometimes 
bad games are fun precisely because you can play them with friends! 
Use review sites to determine how many players a game supports, and 
whether they can all play at once or have to hand off the controller for 
alternating play. If your Wii is hooked up to the Internet, look for a 
discussion of any online options the game might have. (See Chapter 14 
for more on picking great games for a party.)

195
 Chapter 11: Picking Out Games
When you know what you’re looking for in a new game, you need to know 
where to find reliable reviews. The following list provides you with a few 
good sources for game reviews:
 
 GameRankings (www.gamerankings.com): Sometimes you’re just too 
busy to read 1,000 or so words that give a comprehensive explanation 
of a game. Sometimes you just want the quality of a game distilled into a 
single number. GameRankings is perfect for those times. The site com-
piles dozens of independent reviews for a game and compiles them into a 
single aggregated percentage that gives a good general idea of the game’s 
critical reception. Games that come in at over 90 percent are considered 
universally praised by critics. Games above 80 percent are pretty good 
for fans of the genre. Games that score between 70 and 80 percent are 
generally for diehard fans only. You should probably avoid anything with 
a game ranking under 70 percent. If you like GameRankings’ scoring style, 
you may also want to check out similar review aggregator MetaCritic.com.
 
 GameSpot (www.gamespot.com): One of the oldest video game sites on 
the Web, GameSpot is also one of the most comprehensive. Practically 
every Wii game released gets a review here, along with a ranking on a 
10-point scale. GameSpot reviews tend to be some of the harshest in the 
industry, meaning it’s pretty hard to get a perfect 10 out of 10. Though 
the reviews are generally written for a hardcore audience of experi-
enced gamers, even relative newcomers can get a feel for the gameplay 
through GameSpot’s detailed prose.
 
 GameCritics (www.gamecritics.com): While not as comprehensive as 
a site such as GameSpot, GameCritics is a great site for a different take on 
the biggest releases. GameCritics reviews generally take a more artistic, 
more holistic look at a game, examining not only its technical merits but 
also the societal impact of the content (if any). The site also offers handy 
consumer guides that detail potential objectionable content for parents 
and possible difficulties that might be encountered by handicapped 
gamers. I might be a little biased in its favor (since I got my start reviewing 
games there roughly six years ago), but trust me, GameCritics reviews are 
great for getting a unique perspective on a potential purchase.
Getting a Deal
With new video games consistently retailing for up to $60 (or sometimes 
more if the games come with peripheral controllers), gaming can quickly 
become a rather expensive hobby.
Here are some tips for maximizing the number of games you get to play while 
minimizing the amount of money you have to spend:

196
Part III: The Games 
 
 Buy it used: If you don’t care much about the physical appearance of the 
game disc or box, buying used is a great way to save a substantial sum. 
You can find used games at a number of retailers, though Gamestop is 
probably the leader in the used game, er, game — with over 5,000 stores 
worldwide, roughly 4,000 of which are in North America. Many online 
retailers, such as Amazon (www.amazon.com), also offer a wide selection 
of used games. Used games aren’t available the same day as brand-new 
games, of course, but you can usually pick up used versions of the biggest 
releases just a few days after the initial release. Used game prices go down 
quickly over time, so if a game is too much to shell out for today, just wait 
a few months and it might come into your price range.
 
 Trade it in: The flipside of buying used games is selling your own used 
games for money toward new purchases. While most stores no longer 
offer cash for your old games, Gamestop and many other retailers offer 
store credit for your gently used games. You get more for your trade-in if 
you still have the box and instruction manual, so keep them handy if you 
plan on cashing in later. You also get more for a game the closer it is to 
release — beat that brand new game in a week and you can sometimes 
trade it in for up to half the $50 purchase price. Stores occasionally offer 
trade-in specials for games exchanged toward the purchase of a specific 
new title, so watch your local store for promotions.
 
 Rent it: Why spend $50 on a game you’ll only play for a week when you 
can rent that same game for only a few bucks? Your local movie-rental 
store probably has a video game section where you can try before you 
buy (or, if the game’s a clunker, try instead of buy). For serial renters, 
Blockbuster Video offers a Games Pass program that lets you rent a set 
number of games at a time with no late fees, starting at $21.99 a month. 
Another way to rent games is through online rental programs that mail 
you a game along with a prepaid envelope to exchange it for a new one 
when you’re done. GameFly (www.gamefly.com) is probably the best 
of these services, starting at $8.95 a month.
 
 Download it: Don’t forget that Wii games aren’t limited to those you see 
in the stores. If your Wii is hooked up to the Internet, you can download 
a wide range of Virtual Console and WiiWare titles without even leaving 
the house. These games tend to be a lot cheaper than those found at 
retail stores, generally falling in the $5 to $15 range. (See Chapter 6 for 
more on downloading games from the Wii Shop Channel and Chapter 15 
for some recommended downloadable games.)

T
o a large extent, no two Wii owners will have exactly the same experience 
with their Wii systems. Given the hundreds of games currently available 
for the system, it’s possible for two Wii owners to have massive libraries that 
don’t overlap in the slightest. That said, there is one game that every Wii owner 
is guaranteed to have access to: Wii Sports, the game that comes packaged with 
every Wii system sold in the United States.
Because every Wii owner has this game, it’s a great reference point for 
getting used to using the Wii Remote as a game controller. This chapter 
discusses how to use the Wii Remote to control each of the five games 
on the Wii Sports disc, including the training games that can refine your 
technique. This chapter also discusses basic strategy for each sport and 
unlockable secrets that you might not know about.
Getting Started
Before you head into this chapter, I assume that you already connected your 
Wii to your TV (as discussed in Chapter 2), connected your Wii Remote(s) to 
the system (Chapter 3), and you know how to start Wii games using the Disc 
Channel (Chapter 5). I also assume you’ve used the Mii Channel (Chapter 7) 
to make some personal avatars. (This last bit isn’t strictly necessary, but I 
find Wii Sports is much more fun when the on-screen players actually look 
like you and your friends.)
If you’ve brushed up on your Wii basics, here’s the drill:
 
1. Put the game in the Wii and start it up from the Wii Menu.

198
Part I: The Games 
 
2. On the title screen, press the A and B buttons on the Remote 
simultaneously to advance to the main menu.
 
 This menu is shown in Figure 12-1. At this point, you have some options:
 
• You can select single- or multi-player versions of each sport by 
clicking the appropriate buttons on the left side.
 
• Clicking the barbell starts the Training mode, a set of fifteen 
mini-games designed to improve your technique in each sport.
 
• Clicking the graph starts the Wii Fitness mode, which ranks your 
performance in three randomly selected training games.
 
 Training and Fitness options are discussed further in the “Training 
Mode” section at the end of this chapter.
 
Figure 12-1: 
The Wii 
Sports main 
menu.
 
Choosing the number of players
After selecting your sport, you’re asked how many players are playing on 
a menu like the one shown in Figure 12-2. If there aren’t enough Remotes 
connected, some player selection options may be grayed out. In this case, 
click More to connect more Wii Remotes to the system (see Chapter 3 for 
details).
Note that baseball and boxing can only be played by a maximum of two players. 
Also note that you don’t need multiple Remotes to play the multiplayer versions 
of bowling and golf — players can simply hand off the controller in between 
rounds for these sports.

 Chapter 12: Wii Sports

selection

Choosing Miis
After choosing how many people are playing, you have to choose which Mii 
will represent each player, using the menu shown in Figure 12-3. Only Miis in 
your Mii Plaza are available here — Miis from the Mii Parade or the Check Mii 
Out Channel won’t be selectable (see Chapter 7 for more on Miis).
 
Figure 12-3: 
The Mii

200
Part I: The Games 
If you have a lot of Miis in your plaza, you can scroll through the list by clicking 
the arrows on the right and left sides of the screen. If you have no Miis, click 
Guest to choose from a small selection of pre-made avatars. If you or one of 
your friends has saved any Miis to a Remote, they can be selected by clicking 
the Wii Remote tab (see Chapter 7).
 
In multiplayer games, each player has to use his or her own Remote to select 
his or her Mii.
After each player chooses a Mii, each player is asked to confirm which hand 
he or she uses for each sport, as shown in Figure 12-4. This selection affects 
how the Remote interprets that player’s movements into in-game actions, 
and also which hand the player’s on-screen Mii uses when playing each 
sports. Click the L (for left-handed play) or the R (for right-handed play) in 
each row; click OK when you’re done.
 
Figure 12-4: 
The hand-
selection 
screen.
 
Skill levels
You may notice that some of the Miis in these figures have individual “skill 
level” numbers next to their names. These skill levels keep track of your 
progress when playing single-player sports — they go up when you do well 
and go down when you do badly. Your computer opponents get better as 
your skill level gets higher in the competitive sports (tennis, baseball, and 
boxing). In games without computer opponents, the skill level has no effect 
on the gameplay.

201
 Chapter 12: Wii Sports
Each sport has its own distinct skill level, so performance in one game won’t 
affect your skill level in another. If you reach a skill level of 1,000 in a sport, the 
word “Pro” appear next to your skill level to indicate your achievement. Pro 
status also unlocks some hidden features in certain sports, as discussed in the 
“Secrets and Easter eggs” sections. The game also sends a message to your Wii 
Message Board when you achieve Pro status in a sport (see Chapter 4).
 
Skill level statistics are linked to a specific Mii, so be sure to use the same Mii 
every time you play a single-player match if you want to keep track of your 
progress. If you delete this Mii from the Mii Channel, your progress will be 
lost, so be careful.
 
Pressing the + button on the Wii Remote at any time during play pauses the 
game and brings up a menu that allows you to quit, start over, or return to the 
main menu.
Tennis: The Racquet Racket
The exact origins of the game of tennis are up for debate, but the game (as we 
know it) has been around since at least the mid-nineteenth century. Wii Sports 
Tennis has been around since at least the 2006 Electronic Entertainment 
Expo, where it was first demonstrated to a crowd of industry insiders at the 
Kodak Theater in Hollywood, CA. Tennis is probably the most easily 
accessible of the Wii Sports games, and a great way for beginners to learn 
about using the Wii Remote.
Getting started with tennis
After selecting Tennis from the main menu, you’re presented with the player 
positioning screen as shown in Figure 12-5. You can use this screen to 
arrange which player will play on which team — the pair on one side of the 
net works together against the pair on the other side (singles matches are 
not available). The gray, question-mark player icons represent computer-
controlled players; these can be opponents or teammates. Click one of these 
gray icons to put your Mii into that position, and click again to toggle back 
to a computer-controlled player. In games with multiple players, note that 
all players have to click the positions they want with their Wii Remotes — 
another player can’t do it for them.
 
A single player can control more than one position at a time, as shown in Figure 12-5. 
Each swing of the Wii Remote swings the racquet for all the Miis controlled by that 
Remote. You can even set it up so one player controls all four players at once, which is 
a great way to practice your ball-watching and timing skills.

202
Part I: The Games 
 
Figure 12-5: 
The tennis

After you’re done setting up the positions, choose your desired number of 
games from the choices at the bottom. A Best of 3 match ends as soon as one 
team wins two games, while a Best of 5 match ends as soon as one team wins 
three games.
Gameplay basics for tennis
In a nutshell, tennis involves hitting a ball back and forth over a net and into 
the large white box drawn on the ground on the other side. A team loses a 
point if a player on that team hits the ball outside that box or into the net, 
or if a player fails to hit the ball before it bounces twice on that team’s side. 
Because this is doubles tennis, the boundaries are determined by the outer 
lines, as shown in Figure 12-6.
Scoring in tennis may seem a little odd for newcomers to the sport. Instead 
of counting up points normally (0-1-2-3-4), scoring in Wii Sports Tennis runs 
0-15-30-40-Game, the final one indicating a side has won that game. When 
both teams are tied at 40 each, the game enters a different mode of scoring 
called a deuce. The winner of a deuce point is said to have the advantage, and 
that pair wins the game if they win the next point. If the pair with advantage 
loses, the score goes back to deuce.
The players in Wii Sports Tennis are initially arranged as shown in Figure 
12-6. The player with Server over his or her head has to put the ball in play, 
as described in the “Controls for tennis” section. The player across the court 
from the server diagonally is the one to return the serve back across the net. 
After that, either player can hit the ball at any point.

203
 Chapter 12: Wii Sports
 
Figure 12-6: 
The initial 
setup of the 
tennis court 
and players, 
including

At the end of a game, the serve alternates to the other team. There are no 
“sets” or “matches” in Wii Sports Tennis: The first team that wins the set 
number of games wins immediately.
This gives the team serving first a distinct advantage, so you might want to put 
the weaker players on the left side of the net when you’re arranging players.
 
If there are two human players on different sides of the court, the screen is 
split into two halves with two different camera angles. In general, you should 
focus on the side with your Mii at the bottom of the screen, because this 
makes it easier to plan your shots. You might also want to position yourself 
around the TV so that you’re closer to your player’s side of the screen.
Controls for tennis
First off, each player should be holding the Wii Remote in the standard, 
vertical position.
 
Grip firmly but not too tight, and be sure you have your wrist strap and Wii 
Remote jacket attached before starting. Stand up with your knees slightly bent 
and make sure there’s lots of room to maneuver without hitting other players 
or any objects in the room. I can’t stress this last point enough — you need a 
lot of space to make sure you don’t cause physical damage to anyone or 
anything around you.

204
Part I: The Games 
Serving
To start a game of tennis, the ball is put into play by the server, as indicated 
by the yellow Server over that player’s head on-screen (refer to Figure 12-6). 
The server first throws the ball up by either swinging the Wii Remote upward 
or by pressing the A button. Either way, when the ball is in the air, it can be 
served by swinging the Remote forward quickly, just as if it were a real tennis 
racquet.
Don’t worry about the speed or angle of your serving motion — all that 
matters is the height of the ball when you hit it; the higher the better. If you 
serve the ball when it’s at the very top of the throwing arc, it zooms quickly 
to the other side of the net with a white trail of smoke behind it. Such serves 
are very hard to return effectively, so work on your timing.
Hitting the ball
You don’t have to worry about moving your Miis around the court in Wii 
Sports Tennis — the game automatically makes them run to intercept the 
bouncing ball. All you have to worry about is hitting the ball when it reaches 
your Mii. Doing this is as simple as swinging the Wii Remote like a real tennis 
racquet. Bend your elbow slightly and swing your arm around your body in a 
wide arc, as shown in Figure 12-7.
 
Figure 12-7: 
Basic form

(left) and

handed

205
 Chapter 12: Wii Sports
 
Correct form and swing speed are very important here. If you swing too fast, 
the game may detect your motion as multiple swings, which can throw off your 
game. If you swing too slowly, the game may not detect a swing at all. The key 
is a nice, smooth motion that pushes the virtual racquet through the ball.
 
Be sure to keep a tight grip on your Remote as you swing. Overenthusiastic 
swinging and sweaty palms can lead to broken Remotes, TVs, and/or priceless 
vases. Be sure all players are using the wrist strap and Wii Remote jacket, as 
discussed in Chapter 3.
Forehands and backhands
There are two basic types of swings in Wii Sports Tennis: the forehand (a 
shot that starts on the same side of your body as the Wii Remote) and the 
backhand (a shot that starts on the opposite side from the Wii Remote). 
Recognizing when to do each type of shot is the key to success. When the 
ball is coming toward your player, try to determine which side of your Mii it 
will end up on — as early as possible. When you’ve figured out if the shot will 
require a forehand or backhand, move the Wii Remote slowly back to that 
side, at about waist level, in preparation for your forehand or backhand shot. 
You’re then ready to swing immediately forward as the ball reaches your Mii. 
Anticipating shots is vitally important to success at Wii Sports Tennis.
Lobs and spins
The way you swing the Wii Remote in your hand affects the way the ball 
flies from your Mii’s racquet. Twisting the Remote toward the screen as you 
swing, for instance, can put speed-enhancing topspin on the ball. Swinging 
the Remote from low to high, on the other hand, lobs the ball high in the air, 
well over players at the front of the net. Experiment with different Remote 
motions to see how the ball reacts.
Strategy for tennis
The following list provides some helpful tips for improving your game in Wii 
Sports Tennis:
 
 Figuring out how to anticipate forehand and backhand shots is the first 
key to Wii Sports Tennis success. Pay attention to the direction and angle 
the ball is coming in at before it actually gets to your Mii, and cock the 
Remote back on the appropriate side as soon as possible. Getting into 
position before the ball gets to you makes timing and positioning your 
shots that much easier.

206
Part I: The Games 
 
 After you know when to use a forehand and when to use a backhand, you 
need to learn how to direct shots left and right deliberately. Timing is the 
key, here. Hit the ball early, when it’s slightly out in front of your Mii and it 
flies away from the racquet side (to the left for a right-handed forehand). 
Hit the ball late, when it’s slightly behind your Mii, and the shot is angled 
toward the racquet side (to the right for a right-handed forehand). This 
might seem tough to remember at first, but keep practicing and eventually 
positioning your shots will become second nature. When you can direct 
the ball reliably, try to place it away from your opponents on the opposite 
side of the court.
 
 After you’ve mastered positioning your shots, start experimenting with 
putting spin on the ball, as described in the “Controls for tennis” section. 
A low shot with some nice topspin can slide by a tough defense, and using 
lob shots strategically can get you out of a lot of tight jams.
 
 If you’re controlling a player that’s standing close to the net, remember 
that you don’t have to hit every ball that comes to you. The player behind 
you might be in a better position to return a devastating shot (even if that 
player is also controlled by you).
 
 As your skill level starts rising in the single-player game, mastering the 
high-speed serves is crucial to succeeding against the tougher computer 
opponents. Work on your timing until you can get that white smoke 
behind your ball reliably.
 
 If a ball looks like it might land out of bounds, wait for it to bounce 
before returning it. If it’s out, you win the point. If it’s in, you can always 
return it at that point.
Secrets and Easter eggs in tennis
You can find these secrets and Easter eggs in Wii Sports Tennis:
 
 Hold down the 2 button after you choose your Miis to play a match on a 
blue court with no spectators.
 
 If you’re on the team that won the last point, you can skip the replays 
by pressing the A button. This can help keep things moving quickly (and 
if you’re playing against me, it can help prevent me from throttling you 
with my bare hands).
 
 When you reach Pro status (with a skill level of over 1,000) you’ll notice 
more Miis crowding the stands on the side of the court.

Baseball: Getting into 
the Swing of Things
The national pastime, baseball is American as Mom, apple pie, and (judging by 
recent sales data) the Wii itself. Wii Sports Baseball is a decent approximation 
of pitching and hitting, but it’s unfortunately not a great replacement for the 
real game.
Gameplay basics for baseball
Wii Sports Baseball differs from real baseball in a number of important 
respects. For one thing, there are only three innings. For another thing, the 
fielders and base runners are controlled automatically by the game. There 
are no stolen bases, no double plays, and no tagging up in this extremely 
simplified version of the sport. Some things remain constant, though — for 
instance, three strikes still make an out and three outs make an inning.
For the pitcher, the goal is to strike out the batter by throwing the ball over 
the plate in a way that’s hard to hit. For the batter, the goal is to hit the ball, 
putting it in play in fair territory (inside the angled white lines) so that it 
lands safely in the outfield (the grassy area) without getting caught in mid-air. 
This is a base hit, which puts a runner on base. Further hits can advance the 
base runners to home plate, which counts as a run. The team with the most 
runs at the end of three innings wins the game (and while there are no ties in 
baseball, there are unfortunately ties in Wii Sports Baseball).
Controls for baseball
In Wii Sports Baseball, the players are divided into two separate yet equally 
important parts: the batters who try to score runs, and the pitchers who try 
to strike them out. Their stories are described in the following sections.
Batting
Swinging the bat is as simple as, well, swinging the Wii Remote like a bat. 
First, make sure you’re standing correctly, with your feet spread about 
shoulder-length apart, your knees slightly bent, and your body turned 
perpendicular to the screen. Hold the Wii Remote vertically, the way 
you would a baseball bat — and wrap both hands around it, as shown in 
Figure 12-8. Make sure the buttons on the Remote are facing toward you, 
not toward the screen. While waiting for the pitch, you can wiggle the 
Remote in your hands to make your on-screen batter wiggle the bat.

208
Part I: The Games 
 
Figure 12-8:

stance.
 
When you’re standing correctly, wait for the ball to cross the plate and swing 
the Remote smoothly in a sweeping motion around your body, parallel to the 
ground at about waist height. Don’t swing too lightly or the game won’t register 
your motion. Swinging hard can get some extra distance on the ball, but keep it 
within reason — there’s no reason the Remote should be in danger of slipping 
from your hands.
Pitching
Before making your actual pitch, you can adjust your aim using the Wii 
Remote. Press the left and right buttons on the directional pad to make the 
pitch go to the left or right side of the plate, respectively. If the controller is 
set to rumble, you should feel it shake when you make these selections. To 
cancel a directional pitch, press up or down on the directional pad to choose 
a pitch that will go down the center of the plate.
You can also choose from four different varieties of pitch by pressing buttons 
on the Wii Remote before the actual throw:
 
 Fastball: Don’t press any buttons when making your throwing motion to 
make a fast, straight throw to the plate.
 
 Curveball: Hold down the A button as you make your throwing motion 
to get a pitch that curves from right to left (for right-handed players).

209
 Chapter 12: Wii Sports
 
 Screwball: Hold the B button as you make your throwing motion for a 
pitch that curves in from left to right (for right-handed players).
 
 Splitter: Hold both A and B as you make your throwing motion to throw 
a pitch that slows down and drops suddenly as it gets to the plate. This 
pitch is great for fooling overeager batters.
 
Occasionally, your pitcher messes up when trying to throw one of the curving 
pitches discussed in the preceding list, throwing a simple fastball instead. A red 
exclamation point appears over the pitcher’s head when this happens. Fielders 
also occasionally make exclamation-point-inducing errors when trying to field 
the ball, turning what should be an out into a base hit. There’s no way to control 
these frustratingly random effects — your best bet is to just learn to live with 
them when they happen.
After you’ve chosen your aim and pitch type, throwing a pitch is as simple as 
making a throwing motion with your arm. Just swing the Remote over your 
head and down in front of your body.
 
Don’t let go of the Wii Remote. Yes, I know you’d let go of a real baseball, but 
I repeat: DO NOT let go of the Wii Remote — just flick it in your wrist while 
maintaining a tight grip around it.
The speed with which you whip the Remote around your body affects the speed 
of the in-game pitch, from a slow 60 mph floater to a 90+ mph fastball. Despite 
this, there’s no reason to get crazy with your Remote flicking. Whipping the 
Remote too hard is how wrist straps and objects in the room get broken. Keep 
things within reason and you should be fine.
Strategy for baseball
The following list provides some helpful tips for improving your game in Wii 
Sports Baseball:
 
 When batting, timing is the key. Hit the ball when it’s square over the 
plate and it flies straight. Hit it too early or late, and it flies off to the side 
and foul. The game tells you if you’re swinging too early or too late. Pay 
attention and concentrate on swinging at the right time.
 
 Don’t just swing at every pitch — wait for one that looks easy to hit. 
Don’t go chasing balls that aren’t going to go over the plate. Be careful, 
though — the strike zone is bigger than you might think. Watch out for 
crafty pitches such as the sinker (nearly impossible to hit well, but it’s 
almost always a ball if you don’t swing). Remember, four balls means a 
free base runner!

210
Part I: The Games 
 
 Swing power also has an important role in batting. You should swing 
hard enough to get the ball out of the infield, but not so hard that the 
ball is easy to catch by the outfielders. When you’ve got the timing and 
power down, it should be pretty easy to get relatively reliable base hits.
 
 If you’re tired of boring, reliable base hits, you can always try swinging for 
the fences to get some home runs. Be sure to swing as hard as possible 
and raise the Remote from low to high as you swing. Timing and pitch 
position are still important when going for homers, of course. Perfect your 
technique with the Hitting Home Runs training game (see the later section, 
“Baseball training games”).
 
 While pitching, mix up your pitches. Don’t always go for top speed fast-
balls — throw in some off-speed pitches and curves, too. Don’t be afraid 
to make the batter chase an outside pitch or a splitter on occasion.
Secrets and Easter eggs in baseball
You can find these secrets and Easter eggs in Wii Sports Baseball:
 
 If either team is winning by five runs or more at the end of an inning, a 
“mercy rule” kicks in and ends the game early.
 
 While pitching, you can change to a sidearm throwing style by pressing 
the 2 button on the Wii Remote. This doesn’t affect the way the pitches 
actually fly, just the way the Mii’s pitching motion looks on-screen. Press 
the 1 button to go back to an overhand pitching style.
Getting Bowled Over with Bowling
Everyone’s favorite alley-based sport has been simulated by countless 
video games over the years. Wii Sports Bowling is the first such simulation 
that actually makes the player perform real bowling motions instead of 
just pressing some buttons on a controller. Wii Sports Bowling is great for 
mastering fine control of the Wii Remote, and is probably the most accurate 
representation of its real sport to be found on the Wii Sports disc.
General gameplay in bowling
The goal of bowling is to knock down all ten pins by rolling a ball down to the 
end of a lane. The game is divided into ten frames with two chances to knock 
down pins in each frame.
The score for each frame is equal to the number of total pins knocked down 
in that frame, unless all ten pins are knocked down. If all ten pins are knocked 

211
 Chapter 12: Wii Sports
down in one throw, the total from the next two throws is added to that 
frame’s score (this is called a strike). If it takes both throws to knock down all 
the pins in the frame, the total from the next throw is added to that frame’s 
score (this is called a spare).
A perfect game is 12 strikes in a row (including two extra strikes for the 
bonus on the tenth frame) for a total of 300 points.
Controls for bowling
Throwing a ball down the lane is probably the most complex process in all 
of Wii Sports, so I’ve broken it down into its component parts. Follow these 
steps and you’ll be hurling the ball down the lane in no time:
 
1. Position your bowler.
 
 Use the left and right buttons on the directional pad to align your bowler 
in relation to the pins.
 
2. Aim your shot.
 
 When your bowler is positioned, press the A button to switch from 
positioning mode to aiming mode. In aiming mode, use the left and right 
buttons on the directional pad to angle your shot, as represented by the 
red dotted line going down the lane, as shown in Figure 12-9. Press up 
on the directional pad to zoom in on the pins and get a better view of 
your aim — press up again to go back to the normal view. If you need to 
adjust your bowler’s position again for any reason, press A to go back to 
positioning mode.

212
Part I: The Games 
 
3. Stand in the ready position.
 
 Stand up straight and hold the Wii Remote in the standard vertical 
position, as shown in the “a” part of Figure 12-10. Bring the Wii Remote 
up to your chest, making sure the tip of the Remote is pointing toward 
the ceiling. Your on-screen Mii raises the ball upwards to his or her 
chest when you do this.
 
4. Begin your throw.
 
 When you’re ready to throw, press the B button on the Wii Remote. 
Your Mii immediately starts advancing toward the lane. As he advances, 
quickly swing your arm back and to the side, as if you were preparing 
to throw a real bowling ball as shown in the “b” part of Figure 12-10. Be 
sure to continue holding the B button through this process, or your Mii 
will drop the ball too early.
 
5. Swing forward and release.
 
 While still holding the B button, swing your arm forward in a smooth 
motion, as if you were throwing a real bowling ball. You may want to 
step forward with your opposite foot while doing this, as shown in the 
“c” part of Figure 12-10. Release the B button at any point during this 
forward motion to release the ball. Timing is important — if you release 
the B button too late or too early, the ball simply drops to the ground 
instead of rolling forward. Do not actually throw the Wii Remote, but do 
follow through with the Remote after releasing the B button.

213
 Chapter 12: Wii Sports
 
 The speed of your forward swing at the time of release affects the speed 
of the ball in the game. You can also add spin to the ball by twisting 
the Remote in your hand just before releasing the B button (see the 
“Strategy for bowling” section for more on this).
 
The process in Steps 4 and 5 happen quite quickly, so you should start making 
your throwing motion as soon as you first press the B button. If you mess up 
or let go of the B button at the wrong time, don’t panic — just press A and 
start again from Step 3.
 
If you’re using a single Wii Remote for multiple players, you have to hand off 
the Remote between frames.
Strategy for bowling
The following list provides some helpful tips for improving your game in Wii 
Sports Bowling:
 
 Many beginners complain that their shots drift to one side for no reason. 
There is a reason behind this strange drift, though. Most people naturally 
twist their wrists slightly at the end of their throwing motion. If you’re 
going for a straight shot, focus on really keeping the remote straight and 
level through the entire throwing motion. The smoother your throwing 
motion is, the better. Letting go of the B button early can also help limit 
this unintentional drift.
 
 When you’re comfortable with straight throws, try adding some spin to the 
ball by deliberately twisting the Remote in the desired direction just before 
you release the B button. Don’t twist the Remote too much (more than 90 
degrees), or the game might not register the spin correctly. The ball starts 
out going straight, and then starts drifting in the direction of the twist as 
it goes down the lane. These curved shots get more “pin action” and have 
a much better chance of getting a strike than straight shots. Remember to 
adjust your curve according to your aim and throwing power — a slow-
moving shot is much more affected by spin than a fast-moving one.
 
 In general, don’t aim directly for the head pin. Instead, aim for what 
bowlers call “the pocket,” a sweet spot just between the 1 and 3 pins for 
right-handed bowlers, or between the 1 and 2 pins for lefties (see the 
labeled pin diagram in the upper-left corner of Figure 12-9). Shots that 
hit the pocket have a better chance of being strikes and not leaving a 
split, where two or more pins are left standing far apart.

214
Part I: The Games 
 
 After you find a combination of positioning, aiming, power, and curve 
that gets a strike, stick with it. Work on repeating that shot reliably over 
and over, with the same throwing speed and curve. It might not be very 
exciting, but maintaining this consistency is the key to getting a lot of 
strikes and really high scores.
 
 Even expert bowlers can’t get a strike every time. What separates the 
good bowlers from the great ones is the ability to turn missed strikes 
into spares by picking up the last few pins on the second throw. Work 
hard on aiming and throwing accurately to pick up those spares to get 
consistently high scores.
Secrets and Easter eggs in bowling
You can find these secrets and Easter eggs in Wii Sports Bowling:
 
 Right after you choose your Miis (as the screen fades to black), hold 
down the following directions on the Remote’s directional pad to change 
the color of your bowling ball:
 
• Up: Blue
 
• Down: Green
 
• Left: Red
 
• Right: Gold
 
 To shock the assembled audience of Miis in the bowling alley, release 
the B button at the very back of your backswing (see Step 4 in the 
“Controls for bowling” section). The ball flies backwards, causing the 
Miis in the alley to jump and scream in surprise.
 
 To make the audience of Miis laugh at you, maneuver your bowler to 
either side of the alley. Aim the shot as far as it will go to that same side, 
until the red aiming line goes into the adjacent lane. Throw the ball as 
normal, releasing B at the very end of your forward swing. The ball flies 
up and into the gutter of the next lane, causing the assembled Miis to 
burst into laughter at your ineptitude.
 
 Reach Pro level by earning a skill level over 1,000 and you can play with 
a special ball decorated with sparkling stars. This ball is slightly heavier 
than the normal ball and curves slightly differently as a result.

Golf: Hitting the Links
Golf has been called “a good walk spoiled.” Wii Sports Golf is just like that, 
except without the good walk part (rim shot). Seriously, Wii Sports Golf is 
part of a long tradition of Nintendo golf games, dating back to the accurately 
named Golf on the Nintendo Entertainment System. All in all, Wii Sports Golf 
is a pretty good representation of the real thing, even though it only has one 
nine-hole course and a limited selection of clubs.
Gameplay basics for golf
Golf is a pretty simple game, when you get down to it. The goal is to get 
the ball in the hole using as few swings (strokes) of the club as possible. 
On-course hazards such as sand traps and high grass (the rough) can make 
it harder to hit the ball accurately and far. Be sure to avoid trees, which can 
block the ball’s path, and water hazards, which can cost you a one-stroke 
penalty if your ball is unlucky enough to land in one.
Controls for golf
 
Grip the Wii Remote firmly but not too tightly, and be sure you have your 
wrist strap and Wii Remote jacket attached before starting. Make sure there’s 
lots of room to maneuver without hitting other players or any objects in the 
room. I can’t stress this last point enough — you need a lot of space to make 
sure you don’t cause physical damage to anyone or anything around you.
Aiming
When starting your first hole, you see a screen much like the one shown 
in Figure 12-11. The blue line on the radar in the lower-right corner shows 
where your current shot is aimed (the ball could end up anywhere on that 
line, depending on the power you hit it with). You can change the direction of 
this line using the left and right buttons on the Wii Remote’s directional pad. 
Try to aim for the hatched green fairway area or the light-green greens on the 
radar. Aim away from the tan sand traps, dark-green rough, and blue water. 
Note the direction and speed of the wind (as shown in the upper-right corner 
of Figure 12-11); take them into account when aiming your shot.

216
Part I: The Games 
 
Figure 12-11: 
The default 
view in Wii 
Sports Golf.
 
Club selection
Changing your club changes the length of the blue line on your radar and, 
thus, the maximum distance of your shot. To change clubs, use the up and 
down buttons on the Wii Remote’s directional pad. Your club choices are
 
 Driver: The club with the potential to hit the ball farther than all the 
others. Use this club for your initial shot from the tee and for long shots 
from the fairway.
 
 Iron: Good for mid-distance shots from the fairway. Not so great for 
shots from the rough or sand traps.
 
 Wedge: Good for short, approach shots and for getting out of the rough 
and sand traps.
 
 Putter: Used to push the ball into the hole when it’s already extremely 
close. Only recommended when you’re already on the green.
Practice swings
After you’ve chosen your club and lined up your shot, it’s time for some 
practice swings. First, hold the controller like a golf club, as shown in Figure 
12-12, with the tip of the remote pointing down toward the ground. Place 
your feet shoulder length apart, and stand perpendicular to the TV, with your 
weak side facing toward the screen (mimic the stance of your Mii if you’re 
confused). Make sure you’re wearing the Wii Remote’s wrist strap and have 
the Wii Remote jacket on.

217
 Chapter 12: Wii Sports
 
Figure 12-12: 
The proper 
grip and 
stance for 
Wii Sports 
Golf.
 
When you have the grip down, it’s time for a practice shot. Swing the Remote 
as you would a real golf club. First swing back and away from the screen — 
farther back for powerful shots, less far for weaker shots. You may want to 
twist your wrist at the very back of your backswing to raise the club higher. 
Then swing the club forward and across your body in a smooth motion, 
ending up with the Remote across your chest and up near your head. Don’t 
worry too much about doing things wrong — this is just a practice shot.
As you swing, you’ll notice that your Mii roughly replicates your swing motion. 
You’ll also notice that the power meter on the left side of the screen (refer to 
Figure 12-11) will fill up briefly with a blue bar. This bar represents the power 
of your practice shot. The white dots on the bar correspond to the white dots 
on the blue line shot path on the radar. For example, a shot that filled the 
power meter up to the second white dot would fly roughly to the second white 
dot on the radar’s blue line. A shot that filled the power meter to the yellow 
diamond at the top would fly to the yellow diamond at the end of the blue line 
on the radar. Note that these power markings are approximate and that your 
shot can be affected by the wind. Also remember that the ball bounces after 
landing, and could roll off into a hazard if you’re not careful.
Note that it is possible to swing too hard. Try taking a practice swing as fast as 
possible and you’ll probably notice the Power Bar turn red and start wobbling 
(you hear a truly awful sound come out of the Wii Remote speaker, too). Shots 
that turn the power meter red tend to drift off-center at random, often ending 

218
Part I: The Games 
up quite far from their intended target. For accurate, powerful shots, keep 
practicing until you can get the power meter to fill up close to the yellow dot 
but not beyond it.
 
When your ball is sitting in the rough or a sand trap, the top portion of the 
power meter is grayed out. Any shot whose power goes into this grayed-out 
area turns red and be subject to the random wobble.
The swing
After you’ve practiced enough and feel you have a good handle on your 
power level, hold down the A button on the Remote to make your on-screen 
golfer approach the ball. While still holding A, repeat the shot you just 
practiced and the ball flies through the air with the greatest of ease. Be sure 
to hold A through the entire shot motion — if you let go early, your golfer 
backs up frustratingly at the last second.
Putting
When you reach the green (the small green area around the hole), you’re 
forced to use the putter to push the ball toward the hole. Aiming and 
swinging the putter works just like aiming and swinging the other clubs, 
but it requires a much smaller and more restrained swing. Don’t follow 
through too much on your putts or your power meter overfills every time. 
A light touch is the key.
 
While on the green, you can change the camera to a lower angle by pressing 
the 2 button. You can get a more detailed view of the elevation of various 
parts of the green by hitting the 1 button. Lighter colors in this view represent 
higher points than darker colors.
Strategy for golf
The following list provides some helpful tips for improving your game in Wii 
Sports Golf:
 
 Mastering shot power is the key to low scores. Don’t focus too much on 
proper golfing form — the Wii doesn’t care. Instead, focus on making a 
smooth and steady motion and controlling the speed of the Remote as it 
reaches the bottom of your swinging motion. Practice makes perfect, so 
keep trying those practice shots until you’re confident you can get the 
desired distance. Don’t let anybody rush you! Golf is a game of patience.
 
 While it’s pretty easy to fill up the power meter with a little practice, 
pulling off weaker shots can be a little tough. If you swing the Remote 
too slowly, the game might not even detect that you made a swing at all 
(this is especially true on putts). Try flicking your wrist a little bit at the 
end of a slow swing to get the Wii to detect the weak shots.

219
 Chapter 12: Wii Sports
 
 Remember to pay attention to the wind — it can easily guide a perfect 
shot into an errant hazard if you’re not careful. Remember that the ball 
is going to bounce and roll after it lands too, so aiming your shot for the 
edge of that water hazard might be a little risky.
 
 Overpowered shots that turn the power meter red aren’t always a bad 
thing. Yes, it’s harder to predict where they’ll end up, but if you really 
need a little extra oomph on a shot, it might be worth the risk. Use these 
overpowered shots sparingly.
 
 Learn how to read the greens when putting. Remember that the ball 
tends to drift downhill slightly as it rolls, so aim your shot toward the 
uphill side of the hole. Also remember that an uphill putt might need a 
little more oomph to get to the hole, while a downhill hole might need 
a little less. Don’t use too much oomph, though, or the ball is liable to 
bounce over and past the hole.
 
 Be conservative to start. Don’t go for the tricky shot that grazes right up 
against the edge of the sand trap unless you’re sure you can get it. When 
you know the courses and the controls a little better, you can try getting 
fancy.

Boxing: The S-Wii-t Science
Whether you’re a prizefighter or a pacifist in real life, Wii Sports Boxing is a 
great way to let out aggression without the risk of breaking a rib or losing 
teeth. Plus, it’s almost as good a workout as real boxing. In fact, it’s by far the 
most motion-intensive game in the Wii Sports library.
Gameplay basics for boxing
The basics of boxing are simple enough — just hit the other guy until he falls 
down. The other side of this strategy, which many boxers forget, is that you 
should really try to avoid being hit by the other guy so you don’t fall down. 
This means blocking your opponent’s punches by keeping your guard up and 
dodging sideways, backward, and generally away from his or her fists.
In Wii Sports Boxing, hitting an opponent takes away sections from the hex-
agonal health meter hovering next to his head (as seen in Figure 12-13). When 
a section of the meter is flashing, it means another solid hit will turn it black.

220
Part I: The Games 
 
Figure 12-13: 
Wii Sports 
Boxing.
 
When all the sections of a player’s health meter are removed, that player falls 
down and a count starts. If the count gets to ten before the player gets up, it’s 
a knockout and the player left standing wins. If the player gets up before the 
count of ten, his health meter is partially filled and the fight continues. The 
more times a player is knocked down, the less energy that fighter tends to 
have after getting up (and the longer he or she tends to stay down on the mat 
next time).
 
While your opponent is knocked down, it’s a great opportunity for you to 
wave the Remote and Nunchuk in your hands. Your on-screen Mii mimics 
your motions and taunts your fallen opponent. Boxing is not a sport for the 
magnanimous.
A Wii Sports Boxing match is divided into three three-minute rounds. If no 
player gets a decisive knockout by the end of the third round, the game goes 
to a point-based decision. Players are scored by punches landed, damage 
taken, and by who scored more knockdowns. Ties are possible, but rare.
Controls for boxing
Note that you need a Nunchuk hooked up to the Wii Remote to play this 
game. Two-player bouts require two Remotes and two Nunchuks. Hold the 
Remote in your dominant hand and the Nunchuk in your weaker hand, as 
shown in Figure 12-14. See Chapter 3 for more on the Nunchuk and how to 
hook it up to the Remote.

221
 Chapter 12: Wii Sports
 
Figure 12-14: 
Proper 
form for 
Wii Sports 
Boxing.
 
The moves in Wii Sports Boxing can be broken down into three main categories:
 
 Blocking: Simply hold the Remote and Nunchuk up in front of your 
face to block high punches. Both the Remote and the Nunchuk should 
be pointing straight up toward the ceiling for this to work. To block 
low punches, move the Remote and Nunchuk down around your belly 
and point them toward the screen. The orientation of the Remote is 
more important than the actual height. Note that each hand can block 
independently, so you can have the Nunchuk put up a high left block 
while the Remote blocks low on the right.
 
 Dodging: Tilt the Remote and Nunchuk 45 degrees to either side to make 
your Mii quickly shimmy to that side. This is good for throwing off an 
opponent’s aim and timing. You can also dodge backwards by leaning 
the Remote and Nunchuk 45 degrees away from the screen. While it’s 
not strictly necessary to physically lean your body as you dodge with 
the controller, it’s a lot more fun if you do (not to mention, it’s a good 
workout). Note that you can throw punches while leaning as well.

222
Part I: The Games 
 
 Punching: Wii Sports Boxing punches can be divided into a few categories:
 
• Head shot: Raise the Remote and/or Nunchuk in a high block, as 
described above, and then keep the Remote or Nunchuk at head 
level and jab forward quickly. The more speed you put into your 
punch the more powerful the on-screen punch will be.
 
• Body blow: Go into a low block and punch forward with the Wii 
Remote or Nunchuk tilted forward slightly and at the same waist 
level for a quick punch to the gut. Again, the speed of the punch 
affects the power.
 
• The hook: Move the Remote or Nunchuk sharply backwards and to 
the side sharply to pull off a powerful shot that comes in at the 
opponent from the side. It might be hard to get the Wii to recognize 
this punch, but keep practicing and you should get it. These punches 
are slightly slower and can leave you open to counterattack, but 
they’re very hard to block and very powerful when they hit.
 
• The uppercut: Swing the Remote quickly from low to high in a wide 
arc, just like a real uppercut. These punches are notoriously hard 
to get the Wii to recognize, but they do work sometimes.
 
• The 1-2 combination: Timing is everything for this quick set of 
punches. As soon as you connect with a punch with one fist, follow 
up with a quick, powerful punch from the other hand. If you timed 
it right, the second punch should do a lot more damage than 
normal and be nearly impossible to block.
Strategy for boxing
The following list provides some helpful tips for improving your game in Wii 
Sports Boxing:
 
 Most beginners make the mistake of simply flailing away randomly with 
the Remote and Nunchuk, trying to get their on-screen punches to fly as 
fast as their real-life hands. The game doesn’t work that way. Be quick 
but deliberate with your punches, and don’t throw a new punch until 
your gloves come back to your Mii’s body after the previous punch.
 
 The early computer opponents fall pretty easily to any quick barrage of 
punches. When you reach the Pro level, though, you need to remember 
to mix up your punches and use blocking and dodging to keep out of the 
opponent’s reach. Look for openings in your opponent’s guard and take 
advantage. Remember, hooks are a good way to get past the opposing 
guard.
 
 The more strong punches you use in reducing the opponent’s health 
meter, the more likely he’ll stay down for a long time. Put together a lot 
of 1-2 combination punches to get a quick knockout.

Secrets and Easter eggs in boxing
After beating Matt in the single-player game, you can unlock special, gold 
boxing gloves by holding down the 1 button during the fade to black before a 
match starts.
Training Mode
These mini-games are the hidden gems of Wii Sports, extending the basic 
experience of the actual sports into fun training vignettes. The games are 
found by clicking the dumbbell on the Wii Sports main menu (refer to Figure 
12-1). This brings up the selection screen shown in Figure 12-15. At first, only 
the top row of training games are available, but simply trying a training game 
once unlocks the one below it.

Up to four players can compete at each training game by handing off the Wii 
Remote in between rounds. You can earn bronze, silver, gold, and platinum 
medals for especially good performances at each game. These achievements 
are noted with a message sent to your Wii Message Board.
The following sections provide a short description of each training game and 
some basic strategies for each.

224
Part I: The Games 
Tennis training games
The three tennis training games are as follows:
 
 Returning Balls: Simply return the automatically hit balls to the other 
side of the net, making sure to land each shot in-bounds. Concentrate 
on your character’s location on the court and watch the timing on your 
swings. Try to get the ball as close as possible to the center of the court 
so you have some margin for error.
 
 Timing Your Swing: Return the balls so that they go through an ever 
shrinking orange target area on the other side of the net. Timing is still 
the key to positioning the shots precisely. Remember, swinging early 
makes the ball go away from the racquet side; a late swing angles the 
ball toward the racquet side.
 
 Target Practice: Bounce a ball against a wall continuously, hitting a 
moving target as you go. Missing the targets weakens the bricks in the 
wall, until the ball eventually flies through the hole you create to the 
other side. Concentrate on slow, deliberate shots that are easy to reach 
when they bounce off the wall. If the ball starts drifting to one side, 
correct for it quickly.
Baseball training games
The three baseball training games are as follows:
 
 Hitting Home Runs: Just as it says on the tin, focus on hitting as many 
home runs as possible. Good timing and a quick, upward swing are key.
 
 Swing Control: Hit the pitches onto the specified area of the field. The 
dark blue area is worth the most, while the white area is worth the least. 
Timing is everything — late swings go away from the batter’s side; early 
swings go toward the batter’s side.
 
 Batting Practice: Simply hit the pitches into fair territory — field position 
doesn’t matter. Be careful, as the pitches get a little fancier as the training 
session goes on.

225
 Chapter 12: Wii Sports
Bowling training games
The three bowling training games are as follows:
 
 Picking Up Spares: Instead of trying to knock down all ten pins, in this 
mode you have to knock down only the pins set up in specially designed 
patterns. Five misses and you’re out. Focus on aiming at pins from an 
angle so they get knocked into other pins when they’re hit.
 
 Power Throws: A new row of pins is added to the lane every round, so that 
the initial set of ten pins has increased to 91 total pins by round ten. As the 
name implies, more powerful throws are more likely to get excessive “pin 
action” that knocks down those stray pins in the back. The pin count is 
doubled when you get a strike in this training game, so really focus on 
getting those last few stragglers for a super-high score.
 
 Spin Control: Use your Remote twisting abilities to curve the ball 
around the lane barriers and into the pins. Note that both leftward and 
rightward spins are required in this challenge. Some setups also require 
a late release to launch the ball over a seemingly impassable barrier.
Golf training games
The three golf training games are as follows:
 
 Putting: Sink a series of ever-lengthening putts. Five misses and you’re 
out. Remember to read the hills on the green by pressing the 1 button 
on the Wii Remote. Be careful with your shot power — too much or too 
little can be fatal. Take your time and you should be fine.
 
 Hitting the Green: Use your wedge to chip the ball as close to the hole 
as possible. Despite the name, just getting on the green isn’t necessarily 
enough — your score depends on the total distance the ball ends up from 
the hole. Shots that don’t end up on the green is scored as “100 feet” from 
the hole, so make sure to at least end up on the green.
 
 Don’t overshoot the hole — take into account the bounce after landing.
 
 Target Practice: Aim your shot for the two large targets sitting on this 
specially designed course. Scoring is based on where the ball lands, not 
where it bounces or rolls to. In general, aim for the back target, which is 
larger and has higher scoring values. Pay attention to the ever-changing 
wind conditions before each shot and adjust as needed.

226
Part I: The Games 
Boxing training games
The three boxing training games are as follows:
 
 Working the Bag: Timing is the key as you throw 1-2 combos to take out 
a series of heavy punching bags. Throw your punches fast, but not too 
fast, and in time one after another for maximum speed and damage. Note 
that certain bags may require you to lean to one side to hit them.
 
 Dodging: Avoid the balls thrown by the trainer by leaning left and right. 
Watch the trainer’s hands and dodge before the ball is thrown. The 
trainer sometimes throws two balls at once — dodge quickly to the 
opposite side to avoid them. The trainer gets craftier as he goes, messing 
with his usual timing, so watch out.
 
 Throwing punches: Hit the mitts the trainer puts up, not the trainer 
himself. Watch that your punches don’t go too high or too low. Note that 
one glove sits a little higher than the other in this mode, so it might be 
easier to hit certain pads by leaning and hitting them with the opposite 
glove. Take your time and be careful not to hit the trainer.
Wii Fitness
Before there was Wii Fit (covered in Chapter 13) there was the Wii Fitness 
mode of Wii Sports. This mode randomly picks three of the training games and 
throws them at you one after another. Your results in these training games are 
used to determine your “Wii Fitness Age,” an extremely unscientific measure 
of your “fitness” that has almost nothing to do with how fit you actually are. 
This age can range from 20 (the best) to 80 (the worst). Your age is graphed for 
every day you play, but can only be recorded once per day per Mii. This mode 
is good for getting a quick workout and adding some variety to your usual Wii 
Sports routine.

Chapter 13
Wii Fit
In This Chapter
 Registering a Mii for a Wii Fit account
 Taking the Body Test and setting your goals
 Working out with the various Wii Fit exercises
F
rom its inception, the Wii has always been marketed as a system that 
would get gamers off the couch and moving around. It’s hard not to work 
up a sweat swinging the boxing gloves in games such as Wii Sports Boxing or 
shaking the controller to the beat in Rayman: Raving Rabbids. But while these 
games are definitely a good way to get moving, the workout always felt like an 
incidental part of the gameplay. With most Wii games, the health effects seem 
more like a fringe benefit than the “real reason” you’re playing the game.
Enter Wii Fit, a Wii game specifically designed to give you a workout. Using 
the included Wii Balance Board, Wii Fit measures your center of balance as 
you lean, shake, and twist your body into a wide variety of configurations. 
Suddenly, your entire body is the controller, not just your arms and hands. 
This chapter walks you through setting up the game and your Wii Balance 
Board, using the board for yoga poses and strength training, and playing 
aerobic and balance games.
Starting Wii Fit for the First Time
The first steps to setting up Wii Fit are the same as setting up any game — 
just put the disc in the system and start it up using the Disc Channel. 
The game creates a new save data file — press A on the Wii Remote to 
acknowledge this.

228
Part III: The Games 
Registering the Balance Board
After the game starts, you have to sync the Balance Board so the Wii can 
recognize it. This process is similar to the one used to sync a new Wii 
Remote to your Wii, as described in Chapter 3. The specific method for 
syncing the Balance Board is described in the following steps:
 
1. Open up the battery cover on the bottom of the Balance Board.
 
 The specific location of this battery cover is shown in Figure 13-1.
 
2. Place four AA batteries in the Balance Board, as shown in Figure 13-1.
 
 Batteries are included inside the Wii Fit box. Make sure you insert the 
batteries in the correct direction, with the negative end near the springs. 
Note that each battery alternates direction.
 
3. Press the red SYNC button on the Balance Board.
 
 This button is right next to the battery housing. The light on the Balance 
Board’s power button should begin flashing (refer to Figure 13-2). If it 
doesn’t, check to make sure that the batteries are inserted correctly 
(see Step 2). Do not push the SYNC button again when the power light is 
flashing.
 
4. Press the red SYNC button on the Wii.
 
 This button is located on the front of the Wii, underneath a protective 
flap. (Refer to Chapter 3.)
After a few seconds, the light on the Wii Balance Board should stop blinking 
and remain on. This means your Balance Board is registered and ready to use 
with your Wii. Replace the battery cover and close the flap on the front of the 
system.
If the light stops blinking and turns off after 15 seconds or so, repeat Steps 
3 and 4 in the preceding list. Make sure the Balance Board is close enough 
to the Wii to be recognized. If the problem persists, contact Nintendo at 
1-800-255-3700 or www.nintendo.com/consumer.

Placing the Balance Board
 
Playing Wii Fit means clearing a lot of space in front of your TV. I mean a 
LOT of space. You may think you have enough space for just standing on the 
board, but some strength tests require you to get down on the floor and lay 
out your body horizontally. Other games may cause you to lose your balance 
and fall into nearby furniture or appliances. Make sure you clear out a radius 
of at least three feet around the Balance Board and that there are no sharp 
corners nearby.

230
Part III: The Games 
Note that the Balance Board should be placed with the power button sticking 
away from the TV screen, with the long end parallel to the screen. You don’t 
have to stand on the Balance Board or turn it on yet — the game tells you 
when to do these things.
Registering your Mii
After the Balance Board is set up, you’re ready to personalize your Wii Fit 
experience. An animated version of the Wii Balance Board jumps on-screen to 
walk you through this process. After a few pleasantries, the board asks you 
to confirm the date and time settings on the Wii system itself. If these are 
correct, click OK. If they’re incorrect, click No to jump to the Wii System 
Settings menu, where you can correct them. (See Chapter 2 for more on 
setting the date and time.)
After the time is set, you’re asked to choose which Mii you want to represent 
you on-screen as you play Wii Fit. The Miis from your Mii Channel’s Mii Plaza 
appear on-screen in groups of ten. Click the arrows on the left and right sides 
of the screen to scroll through the list, or use the + and – buttons on the Wii 
Remote. When you see your preferred Mii, click him or her and then click OK 
to confirm your selection.
Your selected Mii drops down from the top of the screen and takes a small 
bow. The animated Balance Board uses this opportunity to lecture you and 
your Mii about proper posture and the effect it can have on your health. Feel 
free to read through this alarmist rant, or just keep hitting the A button on 
the Wii Remote to skip through it.
Eventually, the Balance Board asks you to enter your height by clicking the 
up and down arrows on-screen. Click OK when the height is correct. This 
is used to calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) later on, so be as accurate 
as possible. You’re then asked to enter the year you were born in a similar 
manner, and then the month and day of your birth. If the Mii you selected 
had a birthday set on the Mii Channel, it is automatically entered here. Neat!
Calibrating the Balance Board
After your personal data is confirmed, the game asks you to press the power 
button on the Balance Board. This button sticks out from the edge of the 
Balance Board, as shown in Figure 13-2. Give the button a quick tap with your 
toe and the light on the power button should blink and then turn solid. If it 
doesn’t, check that the Balance Board is properly registered with the system 
as described in the earlier section, “Registering the Balance Board.”

After the Balance Board is turned on, the game tells you that it is “Starting 
up” in a cute robotic voice. Don’t stand on the Balance Board during this 
process — the Balance Board is calibrating. After a few seconds of this, the 
game tells you to “step on.” Follow its instructions by placing your feet on the 
textured foot areas as shown Figure 13-3.
 
Make sure you’re barefoot — shoes make it hard to make the fine movements 
needed in many games, and socks could cause you to slip and possibly fall off 
the board.

232
Part III: The Games 
After you step on the board, relax your shoulders and stand as still as possible 
as the Balance Board calibrates itself to your weight. If you fidget too much or 
take too much time getting on the Balance Board, the calibration fails and you 
have to step off and try gain. If you stand still correctly for five seconds or so, the 
game displays the message, “Confirmation complete! Ready to go!” So you are.
You may notice a ghostly, floating green dot appearing on the white back-
ground of the screen during this calibration process. This green dot is your 
center of balance as it relates to the Wii Balance Board. This can help you 
center yourself as the game is calibrating and make sure you’re not fidgeting 
too much.
 
Note that you may have to recalibrate the Balance Board many times as you 
play Wii Fit. Just follow the on-screen directions when they tell you to step on 
and off the board and you should be fine.
After the initial calibration, the Wii asks you to input the weight of your clothes 
using the menu shown in Figure 13-4. This is to help the game estimate your 
true weight without requiring you to strip down to your underwear. Choose 
the light or heavy options to subtract two to four pounds from your in-game 
weight, respectively. You can also specify a specific weight for your clothes 
by hovering the pointer over the Other option (as shown in Figure 13-4) and 
pressing the up and down arrows on the Wii Remote’s directional pad. You can 
subtract up to seven pounds worth of clothing, or even add seven pounds to 
your weight if you’re wearing helium-based clothing or something. (You can 
even add zero pounds if you’re exercising naked, but please make sure the 
blinds are closed tight if this is the case!)

menu.
 

233
 Chapter 13: Wii Fit
 
Try to wear the same or similar outfits each time you play Wii Fit, and choose 
the same clothing option each time you start the game up. This ensures that 
the game measures your weight consistently across many days’ worth of play.
The Body Test
The Body Test is your daily measure of progress. The first time you start up your 
game, the Body Test is used as a baseline for your progress from here on in.
Center of Balance Test
When you’re all set up, the game tests your posture using a Center of Balance 
Test. As the game instructs you, go ahead and stand on the Balance Board, 
as shown in Figure 13-3. Relax the tension in your shoulders and stand as 
still as possible over the center of the board. The game gives a three-second 
countdown and then begins measuring your center of balance. Don’t tense up 
during this test — just relax and keep still. When the test is done, the game 
says “All done,” and you can feel free to fidget and move about.
Your results are then shown as a moving red dot on the on-screen Balance 
Board, as shown in Figure 13-5. This red dot represents your center of balance. 
If it’s moving around a lot, you have to work harder on standing still during 
the test. Your average center of balance is shown on the board, along with a 
percentage measure of your left and right balance. Take the results to heart, 
and try to correct for any natural tendency you might have to favor one side or 
the other. You may also want to shift your position on the Balance Board if the 
results show you too far to one side or the other.
 
Figure 13-5: 
The center-
of-balance 
screen.
 

234
Part III: The Games 
Sometimes, after the Center of Balance test, the game asks you to “become 
more aware of your center of balance” by centering yourself on the board. 
A red dot representing your current center of balance appears on-screen. 
Lean your body forward and back and side to side to position this dot in the 
blue circle in the center of the screen. Hold this position for three seconds — 
tightening your abs can help.
Body Mass Index
The Wii Balance Board wasn’t just evaluating your posture during that Center 
of Balance test — it was also weighing you. Yes, the Balance Board can also 
act as a high-tech scale, measuring your weight-loss progress as you play 
every day. The game also uses this weight to calculate your body mass index 
(BMI), as shown on the BMI Results screen in Figure 13-6. This basic measure 
of your health is based on your weight and the height you entered earlier 
(see the “Registering your Mii” section).
 
Figure 13-6: 
The BMI 
Results 
screen.
 
Wii Fit puts a lot of stake in your BMI, even though it’s not the end-all and 
be-all of health statistics (see the sidebar, “The limits of BMI”). The game 
even changes the shape of your Mii’s body to correspond to your BMI/weight 
data. The game also places you in one of four categories based on your BMI: 
Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese. These are technical medical 
terms, so don’t be too offended if you end up somewhere you don’t like. If 
you’d like to view your actual weight in pounds instead of your BMI, you 
can do this by clicking the Weight button. When you’re done watching your 
weight, click Next to move on.

235
 Chapter 13: Wii Fit
Body Control Test
The final part of your initial testing is a series of body control tests. These tests 
measure your ability to shift your center of balance quickly and precisely. The 
first time you play Wii Fit, you’re confronted with the Basic Balance Test, as 
described in the following list. When doing the Body Test on subsequent days, 
you’re tasked with two of the following tests at random:
 
 Basic Balance Test: This test measures your ability to shift your weight 
between your left and right legs. Two bar graphs are shown on the screen 
representing your relative left-right balance. As you put more weight on one 
side, the graph for that side gets shorter, while the graph for the other side 
gets longer. Your goal is to shift your weight so that both graphs stop in the 
highlighted blue area, and then hold that position for three seconds. If the 
graph slips outside the blue area the count resets, so focus on tightening 
your muscles and holding your position. Bend your knees and shift your 
upper body slightly to help you get into the correct position.
 
 Steadiness Test: This test measures your ability to hold still without 
fidgeting. As the countdown begins, straighten your shoulders and 
tighten your abs over the center of the Balance Board. A red dot appears 
on-screen, showing your moving center of balance against a black-and-
white grid. After ten seconds, the grid starts moving behind the dot. 
Don’t move along with it! Continue standing as still as possible. After 20 
seconds, the grid and dot disappears completely, so you have to rely on 
your internal sense of balance to detect any movement.
 
 After thirty seconds, the test is done and your movements is displayed 
on the screen. If you’re moving around a lot, try controlling your 
breathing — slowly in and out. (I find it helps to have my hands clasped 
behind my back.)
The limits of BMI
Even though Wii Fit puts a lot of stock in your 
Body Mass Index, the measure is generally 
a pretty bad measure of your overall health 
by itself. By only measuring your height and 
weight, BMI doesn’t take into account blood 
pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, and many 
other factors that can affect your overall health. 
Even the weight measure can be misleading 
because the BMI rankings assume an average 
distribution of fat, muscle, and bone. Because 
muscle is denser than fat, a person with lots of 
lean muscle may be classified as overweight or 
obese despite being in perfect health.
You also should be wary of using the Body Mass 
Index for people 20 years of age or younger. 
Because children’s bodies are constantly 
growing, the standard Body Mass Index used 
by Wii Fit can be wildly misleading about youth 
health. A BMI calculator for children and teens 
is available at http://apps.nccd.cdc.
gov/dnpabmi/Calculator.aspx.
In short (once more with feeling), while the BMI 
is a useful tool for measuring general progress 
in a fitness regime, it’s not the end-all and be-all 
measure of your health.

236
Part III: The Games 
 
 Agility Test: This test measures your ability to shift your center of balance 
quickly. As usual, your center of balance appears as a red dot in the black-
and-white grid. You have to shift your balance so that the red dot hits the 
blue boxes that appear on the grid. When you hit one box, more appears, 
until the timer finishes its countdown. After a few rounds, multiple boxes 
appear at once, and the boxes start moving.
 
 The key to success here is control. Don’t just flail your body around 
wildly — use small, controlled movements to hit those boxes. Be sure to 
bend your knees and move your lower body along with your upper body 
to get that fine control.
 
 Walking Test: This test measures your ability to distribute your weight 
equally as you walk in place. As the game instructs you, simply walk in 
place for twenty paces. Focus on keeping your back straight and centered 
over the middle of the Balance Board. Try not to favor one side over the 
other, but walk in an imaginary straight line. Be careful to place your feet 
on the textured areas of the Balance Board, or it may not work. The faster 
you walk, the better the results will be.
 
 Single Leg Balance Test: This test measures your ability to balance on 
one leg. Choose whichever leg you’d like and place it on the line in the 
middle of the Balance Board, with your toes facing toward the TV. Lift 
your other leg up and press the A button to start the test. Your side-
to-side balance is shown as a line graph going up the screen. The blue 
borders on the edge of the graph get closer to the center as the timer 
counts down from thirty seconds — if your center of balance touches 
the blue area, it’s game over. Try to last for the entire thirty seconds, 
but don’t be afraid to put your foot out if you need to. No need to get 
hurt. It’s very easy to cheat at this game by placing the other leg in front 
of you, but remember, the only person you’re cheating is yourself!
 
If you do a body test more than once in a single day, you can override the 
initial results. It’s not really useful for anything but bragging rights, but still, 
it is possible.
Wii Fit Age
After your Body Tests are complete, the game calculates a Wii Fit Age for you 
based on your results. This Age is an extremely unscientific measure of your 
body’s age as it relates to your chronological age (“You have the body of a 
20-year-old!”). Note that your Wii Fit Age has nothing to do with your BMI or 
weight and everything to do with your results of the body tests for that day. 
Your Wii Fit Age can vary from 2 to 99 day to day, depending how well you do 
on these tests.
After you get your Wii Fit Age for the day, you can put a stamp on an on-
screen calendar to mark your progress. Point the Wii Remote at the date 
shown on the screen and press the A button to stamp down the stamper. As 
you continue playing, you unlock new stamps to stick on your calendar.

237
 Chapter 13: Wii Fit
Setting a goal
It’s a good idea to go into Wii Fit knowing what you want to get out of it. To 
that end, the game asks you to set a weight-loss or weight-gain goal for your-
self after your first body test. Use the up and down arrows to set a target 
weight and then click OK. You can hold down the A button to scroll quickly 
through the tenth-of-a-pound increments. A BMI of 22 is considered healthy, 
but remember: There are limits to what BMI can measure. Choose whatever 
you’re comfortable with.
After you’ve set a target weight, give yourself a time limit to reach that 
weight. Use the on-screen arrows to choose between two weeks, one month, 
two months, three months, six months, or a year to reach your target.
 
It’s generally considered unhealthy to lose more than two pounds a week, so be 
realistic in your expectations. Consult a doctor before going on any fitness 
regimen. Don’t worry if you’re not sure you can meet your goals — be optimistic. 
You can revise your goals later.
Using a password
If you’re sensitive about other Wii Fit users seeing your personal weight 
and weight-loss goal, you can protect them with a password. Click Yes and 
then use the on-screen keypad to enter a four-digit PIN, and then click OK. 
Re-enter the same PIN to lock your Wii Fit data away from prying eyes. You 
need this PIN to access your data later, so make sure you pick one that you’ll 
remember. (Your ATM PIN, perhaps?)
Navigating the Wii Fit Menus
After the initial personalization setup is done, you’re free to explore the rest 
of Wii Fit on your own. Wii Fit is divided into three main areas: The Wii Fit 
Plaza, the Calendar screen, and the Training menu. The following sections 
explore all the various buttons and options available on these screens.
Wii Fit Plaza
When you start up Wii Fit the first time, you have to go through the initial 
setup described earlier in this chapter. After that, you come straight to the 
Wii Fit Plaza screen, the starting point for your daily Wii Fit training. After 
your registered Miis run in, you see the Wii Fit Plaza as shown in Figure 13-7. 
The various options on this screen are described in the following list:

238
Part III: The Games 
 
Figure 13-7: 
The Wii Fit 
Plaza.
 
 
 Wii Menu: Click the Wii icon to return to the Wii Menu. Remember, you 
can return to the Wii Menu at any time by clicking the Home button on 
the Wii Remote.
 
 New Profile: Click the face with a plus sign next to it to create a new 
user profile. The new user have to go through the entire setup process 
as described earlier in this chapter. After getting registered, the new Mii 
appears on the Wii Fit Plaza as a selectable profile.
 
 Settings: Click the wrench icon to bring up a submenu with the following 
configuration options:
 
• Install Channel: Installs a new Channel on your Wii Menu that lets 
you perform the basic Body Test without inserting the Wii Fit disc 
into the system. (See Chapter 10 for more on installing and using 
the Wii Fit Channel.)
 
• Wii Balance Board Check: Use this option to confirm that the 
Wii Balance Board is functioning properly. Lay the board flat on 
the ground and turn it on. Stand on the board when instructed 
by the game and the check commences. If all four sensors come 
up with check marks, your Balance Board is working properly. 
If the sensors aren’t working properly, contact Nintendo at 
1-800-255-3700 or www.nintendo.com/consumer.
 
• Credits: Click the Wii Fit logo in the lower-right corner of the 
screen to see a list of the people who helped make the game. Enjoy 
the pleasant music and the background exercise animation as you 
do. If you tire of reading, press the B button on the Wii Remote to 
go back to the Settings menu.

 Chapter 13: Wii Fit
 
 Trial: Click the silhouette with a question mark on it to start up a trial 
version of the game that doesn’t require the lengthy setup discussed 
earlier in this chapter. After choosing from a selection of five built-in, 
generic Miis, you can perform a basic Body Test (as described in “The 
Body Test” section) or choose from a selection of 12 training games (as 
described in the “Taking the Training Train” section). Note that weight 
and training data won’t be saved in the Trial mode, so it’s probably most 
useful for visiting friends or family who want to try out the game without 
going through all the bother of registering a new Mii. If you plan to play 
the game more than once, use the setup instructions described earlier in 
this chapter instead.
 
 Graph: This area displays the daily body mass index measurements for 
all the Miis currently registered with Wii Fit. Click the Fit Credits button 
to change to a daily bar graph view of how much time you’ve been 
putting into the game day after day. If you’d prefer to see data for only 
a single player, you can isolate that graph by hovering the Wii Remote 
over that player’s Mii. Click anywhere on the graph and drag the Wii 
Remote pointer to view earlier dates.
 
 Miis: Click a Mii and then click Begin to advance to the Calendar screen, 
as discussed in the next section.
 
When left alone, the Miis on the Wii Fit Plaza screen show off some clever 
animations, doing basic calisthenics and looking back approvingly at the 
graph of their progress. If a specific Mii hasn’t been weighed in for a few days, 
he or she may even fall asleep, complete with big cartoon Zs coming out of 
his or her mouth. Hover the Wii Remote pointer over a Mii to snap that little 
slacker out of the animation and back to attention.
Calendar screen
As shown in Figure 13-8, the Calendar screen is the first thing you see after 
registering a new Mii with Wii Fit. It’s also the screen that comes up when you 
choose a Mii from the Wii Fit Plaza and the secondary gateway to daily training 
with Wii Fit. The various options on the Calendar screen are discussed in the 
following list:
 
 Wii Fit Plaza: Click the wavy arrow to go back to the Wii Fit Plaza.
 
 Graph: Click the button with a line graph on it to bring up a detailed 
chart of your daily progress. Use the buttons on the top row to toggle 
the graph’s display between your BMI, daily weight measurement, Wii Fit 
Age, and Fit Credits. Hover over a dot on the graph with the Wii Remote 
pointer to view the specific value for that day.

 Use the + and – buttons in the lower-right corner to change the date 
range displayed on the graph (pressing the + and – buttons on the 
Wii Remote has the same effect). Note that the vertical range of the 
graph changes along with the horizontal time range. To scroll through 
the graph, click and drag the Wii Remote pointer anywhere on it. You 
can scroll further by letting go of A and grabbing again. Click the Back 
button to return to the Calendar screen.
 
 User Settings: Click the silhouette with the word balloon full of dots 
in the upper-right corner to bring up a submenu with the following 
configuration options:
 
• Edit Profile: Edit the height, date of birth, and password you set 
earlier. Click an option, and then use the on-screen arrows or 
keypad to edit it. Click OK when done or Back to back out.
 
• Change Design: Choose a new design for the stamp used to mark 
your daily progress on the Calendar screen. The more you play the 
game, the more stamps you unlock.
 
• Change Trainer: Toggle between the Male and Female trainers for 
the Yoga and Strength Training trials. (See the “General navigation” 
section, later in this chapter.)
 
• Delete User Data: Be careful! This option deletes all the stored 
data for your current Mii. If you choose Yes from the confirmation 
screen, all the evidence of your hard work and daily measurements 
will be gone, with no way to recover them.

 Chapter 13: Wii Fit
 
 Calendar: The large calendar in the middle of the screen shows a stamp 
for every day you’ve checked in to Wii Fit with a Body Test. Click a day 
with a stamp to see the result of your BMI and Center of Balance tests 
for that day. Click the + and – buttons at the top of the calendar to scroll 
through the months (the + and – buttons on the Wii Remote have the 
same effect).
 
 Body Test: Perform the Body Test for the day, as described in “The 
Body Test” section, earlier in this chapter. You can perform more than 
one body test in a day, and replace the older results with the newer ones 
if you want. In general, though, you should only measure your progress 
once a day. Your weight tends to fluctuate throughout the day, so try to 
do your daily Body Test at the same time each day to keep the results 
consistent.
 
 Training: Open the Training menu to do some actual exercise, as 
described in the next section.
 
On the Calendar screen, click your Mii on the face, stomach, or feet to get a 
rather surprised reaction. Also, look closely for the Wii Balance Board running 
around in the background of the Calendar screen.
Training menu
After working your way through the Wii Fit Plaza and the Calendar screens, 
the Training menu is where you find the real meat of Wii Fit. I’m talking about 
the myriad training exercises designed to make you more flexible, stronger, 
and generally fitter. Initially, the Training menu looks as shown in Figure 13-9. 
The piggy bank on the left keeps track of how many Fit Credits you’ve earned 
through your training today — click on the bank to see the total number of 
Fit Credits you’ve earned throughout your training history. Click any of the 
training types to bring up a training submenu.
 
See that animated Balance Board running on a treadmill in the background 
of the training menu? Click it to unlock the super-secret Ultimate Balance 
Test. This brutally hard test is a lot like the regular balance test described in 
the earlier section, “The Body Test,” but with much thinner blue bars. If you 
can pass all three of these challenges in sixty seconds, you’re truly a balance 
master.

Taking the Training Train
While the Body Test is a nice, daily diversion, the training section is where you 
actually get fit with Wii Fit. Use the exercises and games described in the following 
sections regularly to burn calories and tone your muscles. Try to keep a balanced 
workout with tasks from all four menus for a well-rounded fitness regimen.
 
While some of the training exercises described in the following sections 
require the Wii Remote, most simply require you to stand on the Balance 
Board. You may want to put the Remote in a pocket or lay it on a nearby table 
when performing these exercises.
General navigation
From the Training menu (refer to Figure 13-9), click any of the options on the 
right-hand side to bring up the applicable training submenu. An example for 
the Yoga poses submenu is shown in Figure 13-10.
Initially, many of the exercises on these submenus are grayed out, but you 
can unlock them simply by playing more and earning more Wii Fit credits. 
Hover over an icon that’s not grayed out to see the name of the exercise and 
how many times it’s been attempted.
When viewing a training submenu, you can click the + and – arrows at the top 
of the screen to go directly to the other training submenus (the + and – buttons

on the Wii Remote have the same effect). Click the Back button in the lower-left 
corner or press the B button on the Wii Remote to go back to the main Training 
menu. You can also use the Change Trainer button to toggle between the male 
and female trainers. In addition to the standard training types, the Favorites 
area is an easy place to access your top ten most-played training exercises.

Part III: The Games 
After attempting some workouts a few times, you can unlock more reps or 
harder difficulties. If you’ve done this, you can alter the difficulty or number 
of reps from the description screen by clicking the + and – buttons as seen in 
Figure 13-11 (the + and – buttons on the Wii Remote have the same effect).
For Yoga and Strength Training exercises, click Demo to watch a three-
dimensional trainer demonstrate and explain how to do the chosen exercise 
(if you haven’t done the exercise yet, this demo runs automatically before 
starting the exercise). Click the Skip button at any time during the demo to 
jump to the end, where you can view the trainer. From this screen, you can 
rotate around the trainer by clicking and moving the Wii Remote pointer 
around the screen. Use the 1 and 2 buttons to zoom in and out, respec-
tively. Click the Pause button on the screen to stop the trainer’s movement 
and study a pose, or click Restart to have the demonstration explained 
to you again. When you’re confident you understand the moves required, 
click Start Workout to try it for yourself. While you’re actually performing 
the exercise, press up or down on the directional pad on the Wii Remote to 
toggle the camera angle between front and back angles.
 
At any time during training, you can push the + button on the Wii Remote to 
bring up the pause menu. This menu lets you restart the exercise or quit back 
to the training menu. Note that if you quit, you won’t get any Fit Credits for the 
current exercise.
Yoga
Yoga exercises are all about balance, both physical and mental. While many of 
them require strength and flexibility to perform, the emphasis is on stability 
and calm. It’s all about holding poses, not speed or agility. Yoga exercises are 
great for stretching and strengthening your muscles and can be very relaxing. 
The yoga exercises in Wii Fit are generally less intense than those found in the 
other sections, and are a good starting point for a daily workout.
During most of the yoga exercises, your center of balance is shown as a 
red dot in a small square on the right side of the screen. Try to keep your 
center of balance in the yellow area as you do each pose, but don’t focus 
so much on your balance that you mess up the form. Remember, you’re 
only competing with yourself. That said, the better your balance, the more 
points and stars you get.
The in-game demonstrations do a pretty good job explaining each yoga exercise, 
but the following list gives you some tips and more information about each:

245
 Chapter 13: Wii Fit
 
 Deep Breathing: By far the easiest exercise in the game, this pose 
requires you to stand still and breathe deeply. Really, that’s it. Good for 
a basic warm-up, but not really a great workout.
 
 Half-Moon: Raise your arms above you as you bend to your side. You 
can really feel how this exercise stretches the muscles going up and 
down your hips and torso.
 
 Warrior: This pose requires taking one foot off the Balance Board and 
placing it well behind you, so make sure you have a lot of space around 
your play area. Keep your front knee bent and make sure to keep enough 
weight on the foot that remains on the Balance Board. If you’re finding it 
hard to keep your balance steady in the blue area on screen, try changing 
your stance by putting your back foot farther back. This pose is great for 
strengthening your hips and thighs, as well as for improving balance.
 
 Tree: Place the base of your foot on your inner thigh as you stretch your 
hands high above your head, like a tree. If you’re having trouble keeping 
your balance on one foot, try placing your other foot lower on the leg 
you’re standing on (just don’t put too much pressure on your knee). This 
pose strengthens your legs and back.
 
 Sun Salutation: A bit trickier than the others, this pose involves 
repeatedly holding your arms back above your head, and then 
bending down and touching your toes. Follow the on-screen trainer 
and you should be fine. This pose tones your arms and thighs.
 
 Standing Knee: While standing on one leg, raise one knee in front of 
you, wrap both arms around it, and then pull it in and out of your chest 
rhythmically. Helps your thighs become more flexible.
 
 Palm Tree: Stand on your toes and throw your arms behind you while 
arching your back forward. If you’re having trouble balancing, lower 
your heels and inch forward on the Balance Board. Strengthens your 
ankles and back.
 
 Chair: Bend your knees at a 30-degree angle and stick your hands in 
front of you, like the armrests on a chair. A good all-body workout that 
strengthens your back, legs, and abs.
 
 Triangle: This one’s a bit tricky to figure out mechanically, but well 
worth it. First, take one leg off the Balance Board and put it behind 
you, with the foot turned parallel to the board. Then twist your body 
to bring the opposite hand down to grab the ankle that’s still on the 
Balance board. Point your free arm toward the ceiling and look up 
toward the tips of your fingers. Don’t overdo it — this pose should be 
uncomfortable but not painful. A great way to tone your lower body 
and waist.

246
Part III: The Games 
 
 Downward-facing Dog: Get on your hands and knees in a doggy-style 
position, with your hands on the Balance Board, and then straighten out 
your legs and arms to form a triangle with the ground. Good for your 
back and whole-body strength.
 
 Dance: A very tough pose to balance, this one involves standing on one leg 
and pulling the other leg up and behind you with one hand, while reaching 
the other hand and arm straight in front of you for counterbalance. Take it 
slow and don’t pull your leg any farther than it can go. A great way to tone 
your hips and align your spine.
 
 The remaining yoga poses in this section do NOT require the use of the 
Balance Board, so you’re on your honor to follow the on-screen trainer. 
Using a soft surface such as a rug or a yoga mat helps make these poses 
more comfortable, especially if you have hard, noncarpeted floors.
 
 Cobra: Lie face down on the floor and push your upper body up with 
your arms. Hold the pose and breathe naturally. Strengthens your back 
and helps improve your posture.
 
 Bridge: Another pose that doesn’t require the Balance Board. Lie face 
up with your feet flat and your knees bent, and then put your arms to 
your side and press your hips upward. Great for your torso and hips.
 
 Spinal Twist: While lying flat on the ground, grab your knee with one 
hand and twist it across your body. Stretches your lower back and helps 
align your pelvis.
 
 Shoulder Stand: Another tricky one, you can do this if you take your 
time and do each step. Lie flat on the ground and bend your back to 
place your legs on the floor above your head. Grab your back with your 
hands, placing your elbows on the floor for support. Straighten your 
back and stick your legs as high in the air as possible. Strengthens your 
abs and back.
Strength Training
The exercises in the Strength Training menu help tone your muscles and 
increase your endurance. For an added challenge, grab some ankle and wrist 
weights to make your muscles work that much harder. Follow the whistle and 
try to go in time with the on-screen trainer. Remember, it’s more important to 
focus on the correct form than your balance on the board.
The Strength Training exercises are as follows:
 
 Single-Leg Extension: Stand on one leg while raising the knee of the 
other leg in front of you. Kick your leg back and thrust the opposite arm 
forward for balance, and then come back to the original pose. Repeat 
this motion for the set number of reps. Be careful to move your leg and 
arm at the same time and speed.

247
 Chapter 13: Wii Fit
 
 Push-Up and Side Plank: For this exercise, place both hands on the Balance 
Board and extend your legs behind you in a push-up pose. After doing a 
basic push-up, cross one leg over the other and twist your body to the side, 
lifting one arm straight overhead as you do. If you’re having trouble keeping 
your balance or supporting yourself during this exercise, keep your knees 
on the floor instead of extending your legs all the way out.
 
 Torso Twists: Stretch your arms out to your sides and twist in place, 
turning 90 degrees in each direction. Then twist diagonally by turning 
while simultaneously leaning forward. Focus on keeping in time with the 
on-screen trainer.
 
 Jackknife: Note that you should not sit on the Balance Board for 
this exercise. Instead, lie down on the floor with your knees bent and 
your heels resting lightly on the Balance Board. Then, with your arms 
stretched above you, clench your ab muscles to raise your legs off 
the ground and your arms toward your toes. Make sure to touch your 
heels to the Balance Board in between each rep. Use the whistle sounds 
coming from your speakers to keep time, as it can be hard to see the 
screen while you’re lying on the floor.
 
 Lunge: Take one foot off the Balance Board and put it behind you for this 
exercise. With your hands clasped behind your head, lower your back 
knee so it almost touches the ground, and then raise up to your original 
position. Keeping your abs tight is the key to succeeding at this exercise.
 
 Rowing Squat: Stand with your arms in fists directly in front of you, 
and then pull your elbows in and behind you as you bend your knees 
approximately 30 degrees. Focus on moving in a smooth, fluid motion 
and keeping your upper body as straight as possible.
 
 Single-Leg Twist: Standing on one leg, stick the other leg out to the 
side, putting the opposite arm up at the same time to maintain your 
balance. Then raise the knee of your free leg, and bring your arm down 
in a chopping motion to meet it. Focus on moving your leg and arm at 
the same time and speed; the idea is to keep your balance steady.
 
 Sideways Leg Lift: Lean to one side, raising one leg slightly off the 
ground. Kick that leg up to the side while raising the opposite arm 
simultaneously for balance. Take it slow to start, and then kick your leg 
out more dramatically as you go. Make sure you’re moving both your 
arm and leg at the same time and speed.
 
 Plank: Place your forearms on the Balance Board for this exercise, 
extending your legs back in a push-up style pose. Then raise your butt 
in the air and hold the position as steady as you can for thirty seconds. 
Focus on keeping your abs clenched and your form tight.
 
 The next three exercises in this section do not use the Wii Balance 
Board, but instead use a Wii Remote held in your hand to detect your 
motion and form. Trying to use the Balance Board for these exercises 
can result in slipping and injury. Move the Balance Board to the side and 
use a yoga mat or rug for better support.

248
Part III: The Games 
 
 Tricep Extension: Hold the Wii Remote in one hand and extend it 
toward the ceiling. Grab the elbow of your outstretched arm with your 
other hand and bend the arm with the Remote down to your shoulder, 
and then back up. Focus on keeping your arm as vertical as possible and 
really stretching those tricep muscles. Switch the hand holding the Wii 
Remote in the middle of the exercise and press the A button to continue.
 
 Arm and Leg Lift: Holding the Wii Remote in one palm, get down on all 
fours in a doggy-style position. At the same time, raise the arm with the 
Remote and the opposite leg so they’re parallel to the ground. Keep the 
Remote as flat and stable as possible until you hear the whistle. Switch 
the hand holding the Remote in the middle of this exercise and press the 
A button to continue.
 
 Single-Arm Stand: Lie down on the ground and stick the arm holding the 
Wii Remote straight up toward the ceiling. Use your other arm to pick 
yourself up into a standing position. Focus on performing this exercise 
in one clean, fluid motion. Remember to keep the Remote as vertical as 
possible through the entire exercise to get a good score.
 
 Challenges: Instead of following the trainer, these three challenges ask you to 
compete with the trainer to see who can do more of the indicated exercise. 
The number of reps increases each time you’re able to beat the trainer.
Aerobics
Great for burning fat and working up a sweat, aerobic exercise is what many 
people think of when they think of a traditional workout. The games in this 
section raise your heart rate and make your body a lean, mean, fat-burning 
machine:
 
 Hula Hoop: Shake your hips in a circular motion as quickly as possible 
to keep the on-screen Hula Hoop spinning around your Mii’s waist. 
The only catch is, er, catching the Hula Hoops thrown by the Miis in the 
background. I find the best strategy is to stop spinning and lean my entire 
body to the appropriate side as soon as a Hula Hoop is thrown. Raising 
your arms above your head can help the Wii detect that you’re actually 
leaning instead of hulaing. The more Hula Hoops you catch, the more rota-
tions you earn for every shake of your hips.
 
 Super Hula Hoop: Earn a three-star ranking in the Hula Hoop game to 
unlock this more intense version. It plays just like a longer version of the 
original game, only you have to change between clockwise and counter-
clockwise rotation halfway through.
 
 Basic Step: Step on to and off of the Balance Board in time with the 
music and the on-screen instructions. Note that the directions with blue 
feet mean you should step off the Balance Board to the side, rather than 
backwards. If you find the step notation confusing, try watching the Miis 
in the background and mimicking their moves. Timing your steps with 
the beat of the music is key to getting a good ranking.

249
 Chapter 13: Wii Fit
 
 Advanced Step: Much faster than the basic step, this more difficult 
program also introduces two new steps — one that requires you to 
kick your leg in front of you and another that asks you to turn sideways 
before stepping on the Balance Board. Again, watch the Miis in the 
background if you get confused, and work hard to stay in time with the 
music.
 
 Free Step: Rather than following specific instructions, this exercise asks 
you to repetitively step on and off the Balance Board for the set period 
of time. You don’t even have to watch the screen during this time — you 
can switch the TV input over to your favorite program while you step on 
and off in rhythm. The Wii Remote speaker makes sure you stay at the 
right rhythm. The Remote keeps you up to date on the time remaining, 
and updates your number of steps periodically as well.
 
 You can press up and down on the Wii Remote’s directional pads to change 
the tempo of the stepping. You can also press the A button to change the 
sound of the rhythmic tones on the Wii Remote, or get rid of them entirely.
 
 Basic Run: This exercise doesn’t use the Balance Board, instead using the 
Wii Remote to detect your movement. Simply hold the Remote in your 
hand or place it in a pocket as you run in place. As you bounce up and 
down, your on-screen Mii runs through an elaborate island setting. Try to 
keep an even pace with the Mii running just ahead of you on the screen.
 
 2-P Run: This exercise is identical to the Basic Run, only now you can 
use two Remotes to have two Miis running at the same time. Note that 
this is the only two-player game in all of Wii Fit.
 
 Free Run: Run in place again, this time using the Wii Remote’s speaker 
as a guide as you watch your favorite TV show. The Wii Remote tells you 
if you’re going too fast or too slowly.
 
 Rhythm Boxing: Use the Balance Board, the Wii Remote, and the Nunchuk 
in this complicated game. First watch and listen as the Mii trainer shows 
off a basic pattern of steps and punches with the Remote/Nunchuk. You 
may also have to dodge to one side or the other by tilting the Wii Remote 
and Nunchuk in that direction. When the game tells you to, repeat the 
pattern in the same order and timing as the trainer just did. Perfectly 
timed punches are worth two points, while steps and badly timed 
punches are worth just one.
Balance Games
While everyone knows that exercise is good for you, it can be hard to keep 
up with an exercise regimen that involves the same boring, repetitive steps 
over and over again. These games try to alleviate this problem by working the 
exercise into skill-based games that use your entire body as the controller. The 
games might be a little simple, but they’re a heck of a lot more interesting than 
riding an exercise bike for an hour!

250
Part III: The Games 
 
 Soccer Heading: Lean left and right to head the soccer balls flying at you. 
Avoid the occasional flying cleats and panda-bear heads (which look 
remarkably and infuriatingly like the soccer balls). Note that you don’t have 
to thrust your head forward the way the Mii on-screen does — just lean left 
and right to position the Mii. Hitting multiple balls in a row without a miss 
(or a bonk from an obstacle) activates a combo multiplier to your score.
 
 Focus on leaning slightly and moving into position as soon as the ball or 
obstacle is kicked. If you want to cheat a bit, lift one leg to immediately 
make the Mii jump to the opposite side.
 
 Ski Slalom: Lean left and right to guide your skier through the slalom 
gates. Note that you can also lean forward and backward to control your 
speed. While a higher speed obviously gets your through the course 
faster, you might want to hang back on your heels for some of the 
tighter turns.
 
 Each missed gate is worth a penalty of seven seconds, so really focus 
on making it in between those gates. As a rule, don’t lean too far to 
either side; it slows you down and makes it harder to change directions 
quickly.
 
 Ski Jump: To start, bend your knees and lean forward, slightly like the 
on-screen Mii. Look in the upper-right corner of the screen and try to 
keep the red dot representing your center of balance in the blue dot 
(indicating the perfect aerodynamic pose).
 
 When the on-screen Mii gets to the red jump area, unbend your knees and 
stand up straight and centered as quickly as possible. Don’t actually jump 
off the board — the game gets mad and yells at you if you do. Don’t wait 
too long either, or you’ll fall off the ramp. When your Mii is airborne, stay as 
still and centered as possible to extend your hangtime. The total distance of 
your two combined jumps is your final score.
 
 Table Tilt: Lean forward, backward, and side to side to tilt a floating 
table and guide the balls toward the holes. Be careful to keep the balls 
on the table — if a ball falls off, the table spins around and a few 
precious seconds tick away before that ball is dropped back on the 
playing field. Pay attention to the hills and grooves on each table and 
adjust your leaning accordingly. Don’t be afraid to go up on your toes or 
back on your heels for that final little push to the hole.
 
 Tightrope Walk: A rather difficult-to-control game. Walk in place to 
make the on-screen Mii advance forward on the tightrope. Your Mii 
leans left and right depending on your center of balance. If the Mii starts 
leaning too far to one side, you have to lean hard to the other side to 
center him or her again before continuing your advance. To jump over 
the advancing metal munchers, first make sure your Mii is centered, and 
then bend and quickly extend your legs to jump over it.
 
 Don’t actually jump off the board or the game stops and yells at you.

251
 Chapter 13: Wii Fit
 
 Balance Bubble: Lean forward, backward, and side to side to control a 
Mii suspended in a floating bubble as it floats down a river. Avoid touch-
ing the buzzing bees or the edges of the riverbank as you try to make it 
to the delta as quickly as possible.
 
 Penguin Slide: Lean left and right to control the iceberg underneath the 
sliding penguin. Aim for the fish that jump up from the water underneath 
you. The bouncing green fish are worth two points each; the rare red 
fish that hover over the edges are worth ten — you have to change your 
center of balance quickly to flick the iceberg and grab them. Be careful 
not to let the penguin fall off the edge of the iceberg; it takes a few pre-
cious seconds for him to climb back out again.
 
 Snowboard Slalom: Turn the Balance Board 90 degrees clockwise 
for this game. The controls and goals are similar to the skiing slalom 
mentioned earlier, except now everything is turned to the side. Most 
players find this game more difficult to control than skiing, but with 
some practice it does get easier.
 
 Lotus Focus: By far the oddest game on the Wii Fit disc. Sit as still as 
possible in a cross-legged position on the Balance Board as you watch 
the flickering flame. Don’t get distracted by the fly that flies by after a 
few seconds — just continue to hold your position, breathing gently and 
maintaining focus on the flame. If you move too much, the candle goes 
out and the game ends abruptly. Weird.

ith over two hundred titles on store shelves as of this writing, and 
more coming out every week, there’s a Wii game for practically every 
taste. Unless you’re independently wealthy, though, you probably can’t 
afford to purchase every one of them to figure out which ones are good. 
Somehow, you’re going to have to decide on just a few of those games for 
your personal library.
Chapter 11 has some general recommendations for picking out games, but 
let’s face it — sorting through all the reviews and information on a game 
can be a lot of work. Sometimes you just want a friend to recommend a few 
games that he or she thinks you’ll like.
Well, consider me that friend, and consider this chapter a big box of those 
friendly recommendations. Each of the fifteen games detailed here comes 
personally approved as one of the best currently available for the Wii. These 
recommendations are broken down into categories so you have a handy 
gaming pick for a variety of situations.
 
One more word of warning: Just because I like a game doesn’t mean you’ll 
necessarily share my tastes. Be sure to read the descriptions for the game 
to figure out if it sounds like it will be up your alley. Wiley Publishing and

Five Games for the Non-Gamer
Nintendo has had great success in marketing the Wii to people who don’t 
usually consider themselves gamers. Sure, these new Wii owners might play 
the occasional game of computer solitaire, or a quick game of Bejeweled on 
their cell phones, but before the Wii, they weren’t generally the type to spend 
hundreds of dollars on a game console. These players are looking for simple 
games with intuitive controls and designs that don’t require a lot of previous 
gaming experience from the get-go. The games listed in the following sections 
are for them.
 
Wii Sports and Wii Fit are also great games for the non-gamer. They’re 
discussed in much more detail in Chapters 12 and 13, respectively.
How to get a non-gamer into the Wii
After you’ve been up-and-running with your Wii 
for a little while, you’ve probably told all your 
friends how much fun it is and how much you’re 
enjoying your purchase (and how helpful this 
book as been in that regard . . . hint, hint!). But 
maybe you have one recalcitrant friend who 
just refuses to believe in the appeal of the Wii. 
This friend is adamant — never played a video 
game before, isn’t about to start now, yada, 
yada, no matter how revolutionary or amazing 
you say it is.
I find that the best way to win these stubborn 
people over is to just put a Wii Remote in their 
hands. Really. When skeptics see how simple 
and natural it is to convert their real-world 
motions into on-screen actions with the Wii, 
they’ll more than likely be hooked. Wii Sports 
is probably the best game for this initial demon-
stration, as it doesn’t require much explanation 
to get a new player started (“Swing the Remote 
like a tennis racquet,” usually suffices).
If your stubborn friend won’t even deign to 
pick up the controller, you may have more luck 
just getting him or her to watch. So invite your 
favorite wet blanket over to the house (see the 
“Planning a Wii party” sidebar), and offer him 
or her a seat on the couch, with a view of you 
and your less-wary friends enjoying the system. 
Be sure to put some energy into your play, and 
make it apparent by your face and your actions 
how much fun you’re having. Don’t be pushy — 
chances are your friend will ask to join in after 
a while. Again, when the controller’s in that ex-
non-gamer’s hand, you’re probably good to go.
Of course, if your friend won’t even agree to 
come and watch the Wii, there’s not much you 
can do short of the old tie’’em-up-and-drag-
’em-to-your-entertainment-center approach. 
Of course, I would never endorse such a rash 
action. Let me be clear, you definitely should 
not tie up your video-game-hating friends, 
throw them in your trunk, drive them to your 
house, and hold them captive until they agree 
to try the Wii. That is definitely something you 
should not do. Are we clear? Good.

Publisher: Electronic Arts
Release Date: Sept. 18, 2008
Number of Players: 1
ESRB Rating: E — Comic Mischief, Mild Cartoon Violence
MySims, shown in Figure 14-1, falls into the simulation genre. Use the following 
list to decide if MySims is a game you’ll enjoy:
 
Figure 14-1: 
A screen-
shot from 
EA’s 
MySims.
 
 
 The game in a nutshell: A super-cute dollhouse for your Wii.
 
 Gameplay description: On the PC, the original Sims proved a game 
could be a success without the casual violence and non-stop action that 
characterize most video games. This “game” didn’t even have a goal per 
se, letting players build a virtual house and manipulate the family inside 
it however they wanted. This simple concept led the series to become 
one of the most popular in all of gaming, with over 100 million copies 
sold across the franchise so far.
 
 MySims takes these basic Sims ideals and makes them slightly more Wii-
friendly. Instead of controlling a tight-knit family unit, you create and 
control a new citizen in a dilapidated town full of cute, super-deformed 
characters that resemble nothing so much as Playskool toys. You and 
your avatar are quickly tasked with restoring the run-down town to its 
former glory by redesigning buildings, repairing bridges, and the like. 
To do this, you need to gather magical, emotional “essences” that get

dropped when you perform everyday activities such as gardening, fishing, 
or simply splashing around in a fountain. The endearing character designs 
are so full of life that it’s easy to get sucked in for hours, doing nothing 
more substantial than just running around and interacting with the vari-
ous townspeople.
 
 You’ll like it if: You loved playing with dolls/action figures but were 
never too crazy about cleaning them up.
 
 You won’t like it if: You have a strong allergic reaction to cute things.
 
 My favorite in-game moment: Socking a virtual hotel bellhop in the nose 
and watching the huge, cartoony, dust-cloud brawl that ensues. Why? 
Just because!

 Chapter 14: Recommened Wii Games
 
 The game in a nutshell: A relaxing, interactive aquarium.
 
 Gameplay description: What better way to explore the unspoiled beauty 
of the sea than scuba diving? Of course, before you dive into the ocean 
in real life, you have to drive to the beach, rent some bulky, expensive 
scuba equipment, sign up for lessons, get your diving certification, pick 
a dive spot, rent a boat . . . it’s all a real hassle. For those who don’t want 
to go to all that trouble, there’s Endless Ocean.
 
 As the newest marine biologist with the Manoa Lai Oceanic Research Society, 
your “job” (if you can call such a relaxing task a job) is to explore the ocean 
and identify the wide variety of sea life swimming around down there. The 
game occasionally gives you specific objectives to complete, such as guiding 
a tourist or looking for a specific fish, but for the most part it’s just you and 
the open water. The slow pace and soothing underwater scenes make it easy 
to just swim around aimlessly and feel the stress melt away. Ahhhh.
 
 You’ll like it if: You enjoy relaxing underwater scenes.
 
 You won’t like it if: You’re looking for an action-packed thrill-fest.
 
 My favorite in-game moment: Swimming over a ridge and seeing a huge 
underwater valley, teeming with life, open up before me.

 The game in a nutshell: All the fun of cooking with none of the mess.
 
 Gameplay description: Of all the exciting, real-world items you can 
emulate with the Wii Remote — golf clubs, bow and arrows, steel 
swords, and so on — you wouldn’t think that “chef’s knife” would rank 
very high on the list. You’d be wrong, though, as Cooking Mama proves 
that even a mundane, everyday task such as preparing a meal can be 
made more engaging with the Wii.
 
 Cooking Mama walks you through the preparation of gourmet meals, 
using simple Wii Remote motions to chop onions, peel potatoes, 
mince meat, drizzle sauce, stir ingredients, and much more. You’re 
judged on your timing and speed by Mama, a cartoon cooking expert 
whose exacting standards keep you on your toes as the meals get 
more and more elaborate. The quest for the perfect meal keeps you 
happily shaking the Wii Remote until you collect every last cooking 
medal. Heck, it might even make you want to go into the kitchen and 
make a real meal!
 
 You’ll like it if: You’re a demon in the kitchen, or wish you were.
 
 You won’t like it if: Most of your food comes from the microwave, and 
you’re fine with that.
 
 My favorite in-game moment: Hearing Mama judge my recipe as 
“Wonderful! Better than Mama!” in her endearing, faux-French accent.

Figure 14-4: 
A screen-

Big Brain 
Academy: 
Wii Degree.
 
 
 The game in a nutshell: Learning gets competitive.
 
 Gameplay description: The large majority of games are designed as an 
escape — a mindless respite from the mental toil of school or work. And 
then there’s Big Brain Academy, a game designed specifically to tax your 
brain in interesting ways.
 
 Big Brain Academy is, at its core, a collection of 20 or so mini-games, each 
centered on a basic mental task. One minute, you’re looking for differences 
in two similar pictures, the next, you’re counting colored balls as they 
quickly fall into a basket or memorizing and repeating a complicated series 
of musical notes. On their own, these games aren’t especially compelling, 
but when combined together, the game transforms into a high-intensity 
bout of mental gymnastics, requiring quick switching between many 
different skills to succeed.
 
 In the end, the game rates your mental prowess using a unique (if 
highly unscientific) ranking system that estimates your brain’s weight 
and judges your competence in areas such as memorization and 
analysis. While self-betterment is all well and good, it’s even more fun 
to compete with friends in alternating or split-screen duels. The game 
even automatically adjusts the difficulty level as you go, ensuring that 
everyone can compete together fairly.
 
 You’ll like it if: You like a little mental exercise mixed in with your 
entertainment.
 
 You won’t like it if: You play games specifically so you can turn your 
brain off.
 
 My favorite in-game moment: Proving once and for all that I’m smarter 
than my wife . . . at least when it comes to the tests in this game.

A screen-

Majesco’s 
Bust-a-
Move Bash!
 
 
 The game in a nutshell: Follow the colored, bouncing balls.
 
 Gameplay description: At first glance, Bust-a-Move Bash! seems 
ridiculously simple: Just fire the colored balls from the bottom of the 
screen toward the same colored balls at the top of the screen to clear 
them away. This initial simplicity makes the game incredibly easy to 
pick up and play for anyone who isn’t color blind. But as the game 
speeds up and the balls on the ceiling begin encroaching closer and 
closer to the floor, it takes quick reflexes and a steady hand to stay 
on top of things.
 
 Bust-a-Move Bash! is the kind of game you think you’ll play for five minutes, 
but when you look at the clock, you realize you’ve been blissfully bursting 
bubbles for five hours without noticing the time pass. A complex puzzle 
mode with 500 unique challenges and a multiplayer bash that supports up 
to eight players (each holding one-half of a Remote/Nunchuk pairing) help 
extend the experience past the relatively basic bubble-bursting main game.
 
 You’ll like it if: You like games that are easy to pick up but hard to put down.

Five Games for a Party
Look at the face of your Wii Remote. See the four lights across the bottom? 
Those lights are the Wii’s way of reminding you that you can play many Wii 
games with up to four people at a time. If you’re only using that left-most light 
for one-player games, you’re not really getting the most out of your Wii.
Sure, the Wii itself can be your play partner when there’s no one else around 
to play with, and plenty of games let you play against friends and strangers 
on the Internet. But some of the most fun you can have with a Wii involves 
getting four people in the same room, laughing and flailing around as they all 
try to control the on-screen action. The following sections discuss some of 
the best games for creating that party atmosphere.
 
The five games listed in the following sections are just the tip of the iceberg 
when it comes to multiplayer gaming on the Wii. Check the “Number of players” 
description on the game boxes (or game reviews) to find more multiplayer 
games.
 
Some multiplayer games require more than one Remote for simultaneous 
play, while others allow you to hand off the Remote in between rounds for 
alternating multiplayer fun. Be sure you know which type of multiplayer 
experience you’re getting before you purchase a game (check out Chapter 
11 for help picking out games). Also be sure that you have the correct type 
and number of controllers before you get started. There’s nothing more 
embarrassing than inviting your friends over for a night of Wii fun and then 
finding they can’t all play because you don’t have enough Wii Remotes, 
Nunchuks, or other accessories.
 
In addition to the following games, Wii Sports (which came with your 
system) is also a great game to play at a Wii party. (See Chapter 12 for more 
on enjoying that game with a group of your closest friends.)

 The game in a nutshell: ’Cause we all just want to be big rock stars.
 
 Gameplay description: While the Wii Remote has a wide variety of uses, it 
just isn’t quite versatile enough to accurately simulate the workings of an 
entire rock quartet on its own. That’s why Harmonix decided to package 
Rock Band with a simplified plastic guitar, a microphone, and a full-size 
drum kit that connect to the Wii wirelessly. These extra controllers let you 
play along with simple, scrolling on-screen instructions that tell you when 
to bang the drum, where to grip the neck of the guitar, and what note to 
sing on the microphone (the game even detects and judges your rhythm 
and pitch as you go). Your performance on these plastic faux instruments 
actually controls the music coming out of the TV speakers; the better you 
play, the better it all sounds, just like a real rock band!

263
 Chapter 14: Recommened Wii Games
 
 Four adjustable difficulty levels means everyone from rock neophytes to 
rock superstars can play together, and with 63 songs from the past four 
decades included on the disc, all are bound to find something they like 
(if they don’t, an optional track-pack disc can add 20 more songs to the 
mix). The only potential downside is the package’s high price — $170 as 
of this writing (add on another $50 if you want a second guitar for a bass 
player). If you can’t swing it on your own, recruit some friends to chip 
in. Tell them it’s an investment in regular Rock Band parties. They’ll be 
glad they did when they find themselves coming over to rock and roll all 
night and party ev-er-y day.
 
 Note: As of this writing, Rock Band 2 is in development for the Wii.
 
 You’ll like it if: You want to be a rock superstar.
 
 You won’t like it if: You’re tone deaf and have no rhythm. (Actually, the 
game might help with these problems.)
 
 My favorite in-game moment: Having everyone in the band come 
together to hit that final note with perfect timing.
Planning a Wii party
What better way to celebrate your shiny new 
game console than getting a few dozen of your 
closest friends together for some Wii-themed 
revelry? Here are some tips for making sure 
your Wii-themed bash goes off without a hitch:
  Clear out lots of space: Wii players tend 
to move around the room as they play, 
sometimes more than they actually have to. 
Move the coffee table to the side and move 
anything breakable to another room before 
the guests come over. Also be sure to set 
up plenty of seating for spectators on the 
periphery of the room.
  Prepare some snacks: Remember, players 
can eat with one hand while grasping a 
Wii Remote with the other. Just be sure to 
keep plenty of napkins handy to keep the 
Remotes from getting too greasy.
  Set up a tournament: Nothing gets the 
competitive juices flowing like a tournament, 
complete with a giant bracket/scoring sheet 
set up on the wall. Start off with Wii Sports 
to get everyone warmed up, and then mix it 
up with an assortment of games that test a 
variety of skills (see the list of games in the 
“Five Games for a Party” section).
  Make sure everyone plays: No one wants 
to be a wallflower, so encourage everyone 
to try out the system at least once. Set up a 
system to rotate players off the system after 
a set number of attempts. Pair newcomers 
against each other so they won’t be scared 
off by that one guy who’s already an expert 
at every video game ever made. (You know 
the one I’m talking about. Yeah . . . that 
one.)
  Wii drinking games: For attendees over 21, 
a little lubrication is a great way to loosen 
players up and make the Wii-inspired 
flailing even funnier. Have players take a 
drink every time they win a game, or every 
time they win a point. If you do break out 
the alcohol, be sure to have a “designated 
gamer” (as well as a designated driver) 
who can be on wrist-strap watch. Having a 
tipsy friend break your TV is no fun.

 The game in a nutshell: ADHD: The game.
 
 Gameplay description: Many video games are actually just collections 
of smaller mini-games — simple, five-minute tasks that aren’t quite deep 
enough to sustain an entire game on their own. WarioWare: Smooth 
Moves takes this trend to a logical extreme, splitting itself into hundreds 
and hundreds of micro-games that give the player a simple, one-word 
instruction and five seconds to perform it using the Wii Remote.
 
 The frenetic pace and surreal micro-game design forces you to adjust your 
strategies — and your grip on the Wii Remote — constantly in preparation 
for the next challenge. One moment you’re inserting dentures into a grand-
mother’s mouth, the next you’re shaking your hips to rotate an on-screen 
Hula Hoop, the moment after that you’re using the Remote as a virtual fire 
hose.

265
 Chapter 14: Recommened Wii Games
 
 You can take on these myriad challenges alone, but the game really 
comes together when you get a group of up to eleven friends together, 
handing off the controller frantically between micro-games. The game 
does require some quick reactions, so players who aren’t familiar with 
video game standards might be at a disadvantage. They should still have 
a great time, though, as long as they don’t mind making fools of them-
selves in front of friends.
 
 You’ll like it if: You get bored easily.
 
 You won’t like it if: You want a game that stays on one subject for more 
than five seconds at a time.

 The game in a nutshell: Every mini-game you could possibly think of . . . 
and then some!
 
 Gameplay description: If you remember the wooden tabletop game 
labyrinth, then you pretty much know what to expect from Super Monkey 
Ball’s single-player mode. You tilt the Remote to tilt the playfield, guiding 
the titular ball-encased monkeys through wacky obstacles and toward the 
goal. It’s a fine game on its own, but the single-player mode isn’t nearly 
as important for our purposes as the collection of 50 multiplayer-focused 
mini-games.
 
 No, that’s not a misprint . . . there are FIFTY unique (if somewhat 
simplistic) games included in addition to the full-fledged single-
player mode. With that much variety, some of the games are bound 
to be clunkers, and indeed there are a few you’re liable to try once 
and never touch again. But the variety also means there’s bound to 
be something that you and your friends come back to time and time 
again. For my friends and me, the Snowboard Racing mini-game pro-
vided a simple yet engaging experience for gamers of all skill levels. 
You might get the same effect with Monkey Darts, or Monkey Rock-
’em Sock’em Robots, or Monkey Disc Golf, or the Monkey Jigsaw 
Puzzle, or Monkey Mini Golf, or Monkey Whack-a-Mole. (Remember: 
If none of those sound compelling, there are still over forty more to 
choose from!)
 
 You’ll like it if: You like keeping your options open.

 The game in a nutshell: The fun of go-kart racing mixed with the fun of 
projectile weapons.
 
 Gameplay description: Since its debut on the Super Nintendo in 1992, 
the Mario Kart series has been a simple, cartoon-like bastion against 
the increasing focus on realism in the racing game market. Realistic is 
the last word you’d use to describe Mario Kart Wii, with its fantastical 
characters in go-karts racing around courses with hazards such as 
fireballs, moving walkways, and car-crushing cement blocks.
 
 The basic gameplay is simple enough for anyone who’s ever driven a 
car, thanks in large part to the packaged Wii Wheel, which turns the 
Wii Remote into a stylized steering wheel. Becoming an expert, though, 
means learning how to utilize the many course shortcuts and items 
that grant bonuses such as speed boosts, invincibility, and the ability 
to fire projectile weapons at other racers. These items add a lot to the 
multiplayer mode by letting inexperienced drivers stay competitive with 
expert racers. There’s even a battle mode that focuses exclusively on 
using these items to take out opposing karts in an enclosed arena.
 
 You’ll like it if: You’ve always wanted to throw a banana peel in front of 
that guy who cut you off on the highway.
 
 You won’t like it if: You’re already a racing expert who doesn’t like 
getting blindsided.
 
 My favorite in-game moment: Watching an opponent who’s been in first

ending up in eleventh place.

 The game in a nutshell: Silly rabbit tricks, for kids and adults.
 
 Gameplay description: The real star here is the titular Raving Rabbids — 
crazed white bunnies prone to violent attacks and random, high-pitched 
screaming. Through over 70 mini-games, these “rabbids” get thrown into 
increasingly ridiculous situations that involve blowing up cows, shooting 
plungers from specially designed guns, and even shaking your booty on a 
disco-themed dance floor. The ridiculous situations are sure to pull a few 
belly laughs out of people with a little bit of wackiness in them.
 
 The sequel, Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, released a year later, continues 
the antics and is even friendlier to multiplayer play. Another sequel,

 The game in a nutshell: An adventure that’s equal parts mind-bending 
and gravity-bending.
 
 Gameplay description: Back in 1996, Super Mario 64 practically 
created an entire genre of three-dimensional run-and-jump game-
play on the Nintendo 64. Over a decade later, Super Mario Galaxy 
reinvents that genre by throwing it onto a series of increasingly 
odd three-dimensional planetoids of all shapes and sizes. Some 
are so large that they feel like an entire planet, while others are so 
small that Mario can orbit them with a running leap. Gravity plays 
an important role, constantly changing direction and intensity as 
Mario runs around the worlds searching for hidden power stars.
 
 Super Mario Galaxy might be the perfect family adventure, as it even 
includes some basic support for a second player to join in the fun. 
The second player doesn’t have quite as much to do as the first, but 
he or she can shoot star bits at enemies using the Remote pointer, 
and even help Mario jump over some of the tougher bits. The game’s 
gentle transition from easy tasks to nail-bitingly frustrating chal-

Family Wii night
Most of the games in the “Five Games for 
a Family-Friendly Adventure” section are 
designed for only one player, seemingly 
making the family-friendly part of the title a bit 
unnecessary. After all, what’s there for the 
rest of the family to do while junior is off on his 
virtual adventure?
Well, a lot, actually. Surprising as it may sound, 
watching a skillful adventurer on the Wii can 
be just as fun as playing the system yourself. 
Spectators can help out with the solutions to 
puzzles, often picking out hidden details that the 
focused player might have missed. If you get 
bored sitting fallow on the couch, you can set 
up a system to alternate with your child every 
15 minutes or so (or just when you get to a 
section that’s too tough for you to complete). 
Even if you’re not helping out, it’s still plenty 
of fun to live vicariously through the vicarious 
life of the player. It’s just good, quality bonding 
time, plain and simple.

 The game in a nutshell: A pirate’s life for me.
 
 Gameplay description: The past few years have seen a steady decline in 
the popularity of the pure adventure game. These are the kinds of games 
where you point-and-click to explore elaborate environments and find 
items that work together to provide some non-intuitive, yet strangely 
sensible, solutions to the obstacles blocking your progress. If there’s 
any justice in the world, Zack & Wiki will lead this fading genre to its 
glorious resurgence.

272
Part III: The Games 
 
 You control Zack, a young, towheaded pirate wannabe, and his 
transforming, flying monkey Wiki, on a quest to recover the golden 
skeleton of a pirate legend. Along the way you have to guess-and-
check your way through a wide variety of inventive traps, many 
of which require you to convert the local wildlife into useful tools 
with the ring of a magical bell. The old-school brain-teasers can 
sometimes be frustratingly obtuse, but the game’s lighthearted 
tone and super-cute animation keeps you scratching your head — 
or running for the strategy guide.
 
 You’ll like it if: You love banging your head against some tough puzzles.
 
 You won’t like it if: You’re looking for a game with a lot of action.
 
 My favorite in-game moment: Finally figuring out that the solution to a 
puzzle was staring me in the face all along, if only I had realized it.

 Chapter 14: Recommened Wii Games
 
 The game in a nutshell: Your standard boy-meets-girl, girl-gets-captured, 
boy-turns-into-wolf, boy/wolf-saves-girl-with-help-of-mystical-dark-world-
entity story.
 
 Gameplay description: The series that practically invented the action-
adventure game is back with this Wii launch title. As usual, you control 
Link, an elvish boy who has greatness thrust upon him when he becomes 
the one and only being who can stop the world from being engulfed in 
an encroaching, permanent twilight. Oh, did I mention the twilight turns 
him into a wolf? Or that a strange creature from the Twilight realm named 
Midna is helping him out? That’s all kind of important.
 
 Link starts out relatively weak, but true to the series, he periodically 
gains new items and abilities to advance past various obstacles as the 
game goes on. The game makes rather satisfying use of the Wii’s motion 
controls to swing Link’s sword, aim his bow and arrow, and more. But 
the real stars here are the elegantly designed dungeons, which cap off a 
series of intriguing puzzles with massive bosses that really show off the 
Wii’s graphical chops.
 
 You’ll like it if: You’ve always wanted to save an entire fantasy realm.
 
 You won’t like it if: You prefer games that are more grounded in reality.
 
 My favorite in-game moment: A thrilling horseback swordfight atop a 
crumbling bridge.

Part III: The Games 
 
Figure 14-14: 
A screen-

LucasArts’ 
Lego Star 
Wars: The 
Complete 
Saga.
 
 
 The game in a nutshell: It’s Star Wars . . . in Lego form. The title really 
says it all. . . .
 
 Gameplay description: Seeing the familiar universe of the Star Wars 
movies recast as a series of battles between super-cute and largely 
silent Lego mini-figures does take some getting used to. When you do 
get used to it, though, you’re in for one of the most mindlessly fun 
action experiences you can have with your Wii.
 
 Simple action is the name of the game here, with the familiar stories 
of all six Star Wars movies boiled down to endless waves of attacking 
aliens, robots, and storm troopers. The game is tuned for simplicity, 
meaning even gaming neophytes can take out large swathes of enemies 
using blasters, light sabers, and the Jedi’s signature force powers. It gets 
even more fun when you add a second player to join in the plastic-brick-
based carnage.
 
 Lego Star Wars is also one of the rare games that enables you to play 
cooperatively with another player, and fighting the galactic empire 
with a partner is delightful. It’s all a little repetitive, but it’s hard to 
care when blasting enemies into their component bricks is such an 
endearing experience. You’ll want to keep playing just to see the next 
familiar Star Wars character or locale done up in the inimitable Lego 
style.
 
 You’ll like it if: You acted out the Death Star run with action figures as a 
child.
 
 You won’t like it if: You’ve never seen a Star Wars movie.
 
 My favorite in-game moment: Destroying a room full of storm troopers 
and then collecting up the Lego pieces they drop to buy new Lego 
vehicles.

Super Paper Mario, shown in Figure 14-15, falls into the role-playing genre. Use 
the following list to decide if Super Paper Mario is a game you’ll enjoy:
 
Figure 14-15: 
A screen-
shot from 
Nintendo’s 
Super Paper 
Mario.
 
 
 The game in a nutshell: A two-dimensional plumber in a three-
dimensional world.
 
 Gameplay description: While Mario is best known for run-and-jump action 
games, more recently he’s starred in a series of successful, albeit slower-
paced, role-playing games where the focus is on turn-based battles rather 
than quick reflex action. Super Paper Mario mixes these two distinct Mario 
game styles into a delightful blend that captures the best of both genres.
 
 The story, which revolves around a quest to collect some powerful stars 
and save the universe, isn’t really important. What’s important is the 
gameplay, which sees Mario switching between a flat, two-dimensional 
side-scrolling quest to a full three-dimensional open world with the 
touch of a button. This quick-switch in perspective is the key to solving 
some mind-bending puzzles that change the way you look at the world 
for hours after you put down the controller. Add in the basic jump-on-
enemies-heads action of the original Mario series, and it’s like mixing 
peanut butter and chocolate.

 You’ll like it if: You want a new perspective on the world.
 
 You won’t like it if: Your current perspective on the world is just fine,

A
s the video-game medium gets older, gamers who grew up with classic 
systems might find themselves nostalgic for the simple games of yester-
year. Similarly, new gamers might be curious about the decades of gaming 
they missed. Luckily, the Wii lets both groups relive the golden age of gaming 
through the Wii Shop Channel and its library of hundreds of downloadable 
classics. Not only that, but the service has recently added original WiiWare 
games designed specifically for the Wii system. This chapter details some 
games that are well worth your hard-earned Wii Shop Points.
Note that this chapter barely scratches the surface of the selection of great 
games available for download on the Wii. I’ve tried to highlight games that 
range from a wide variety of developers, systems, and franchises on offer. A 
complete list of the true classics available on the Wii Shop Channel could fill 
up a whole separate book.
 
To download any of the games listed here, you need to have your Wii hooked 
up to the Internet and purchase them using the Wii Shop Channel. Many of 
these games require extra controllers besides the original Wii Remote and 
Nunchuk included with your system.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
Figure 15-1:

64.
 
 
 Gameplay description: Eleven years after Super Mario Bros. practically 
invented the two-dimensional run-and-jump platform game, Super Mario 
64 reinvented the concept for a new generation and a new dimension. 
The story hasn’t evolved much — it’s still a tale of a captured princess 
and the high-jumping plumber who has to save her — but you don’t play 
a game like this for the riveting storyline. You play it for the sense of 
exploration, the thrill of finding one of the 120 secret power stars hidden 
in some remote corner of one the game’s 15 sprawling, beautifully 
designed levels. Heck, it’s a delight just to run around the castle court-
yard, whiling away the time simply climbing trees, swimming in the 
moat, or even flying around the spires.
 
 You’ll like it if: You’re a fan of joy.

Toe Jam and Earl, shown in Figure 15-2, falls into the platform game genre. 
Use the following list to decide if Toe Jam and Earl is a game you want to 
download:
 
 The game in a nutshell: The funkiest game on this side of the galaxy.
 
 Gameplay description: Saying Toe Jam & Earl is unique is like saying 
the Parthenon is kind of old. You control either a three-legged red 
tongue-shaped creature named Toe Jam or his large, orange buddy Earl 
as they wander around Earth looking for the pieces of their wrecked 
ship. This isn’t a normal conception of Earth, though — this world is 
a randomly generated maze of hazards including sadistic, prancing 
dentists, shopping-cart-pushing soccer moms, and pitchfork-wielding 
red devils, among other distractions. Luckily, Toe Jam and Earl have 
access to items such as tomato-launching slingshots, high-jumping 
spring shoes, and zippy rocket boots to help them get around and away 
from these hazards.
 
 Traipsing around by your lonesome is all right, but the search becomes 
much more fun with a second player who can navigate on a split-screen. 
You can work together to cover more ground, or just cover each other’s 
back as the hazards get more numerous.
 
 You’ll like it if: You’re looking for something different.
 
 You won’t like it if: You like your game straightforward and fast-paced.
 
 My favorite in-game moment: Using the Rocket Skates to fly across the

Figure 15-3: 
A screen-
shot from 
The Legend 
of Zelda: A

Past.
 
 
 The game in a nutshell: The pinnacle of two-dimensional adventuring.
 
 Gameplay description: While the original Legend of Zelda helped create 
the two-dimensional action-adventure genre, A Link to the Past perfected 
it. The story starts with an unexpectedly touching opening vignette 
wherein young hero Link ventures out in the rainy night to receive a 
sword from his betrayed, dying uncle. From there the tale expands to 
include a captured princess, evil wizard, a mystical sword, and a magic 
mirror that transports Link to a dark world that mirrors his own in 
strange and disturbing ways.
 
 It’s this magic mirror that is the key to many of Link to the Past’s clever 
puzzles, which involve manipulating items in one world to gain an 
advantage in the other. It’s not all about brain-teasers, though — there 

283

are plenty of monsters to swing your sword at, including some impres-

Release Date/System: 1994, Genesis
Number of Players: 1
ESRB Rating: E - Comic Mischief
Cost: 800 Wii Shop Points
Sonic the Hedgehog 2, shown in Figure 15-4, falls into the platform game 
genre. Use the following list to decide whether Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a game 
you want to download:
 
 The game in a nutshell: He’s the fastest thing alive.
 
 Gameplay description: In the early 90s, Sega was looking for a new 
mascot to make its Genesis system stand out from the Super Nintendo 
and its dominant Super Mario franchise. That mascot was Sonic, a spiky 
blue hedgehog with big red high-tops and an attitude. Where Mario 
games stressed exploration and puzzle solving, Sonic games emphasized 
speedy dashes through thrilling loops, sky-high jumps, and tumbles. 
Sonic 2 was the pinnacle of this design, sending Sonic and new compan-
ion Tails the fox through levels that resemble a Vegas casino, a massive 
oil rig, and a flying super-fortress. The imaginative level design and 
fast-paced, white-knuckle gameplay turn the game into a day at the 
theme park.
 
 You’ll like it if: You like your games to resemble the roller coasters at a 
theme park.
 
 You won’t like it if: You prefer your games to resemble the spinning

Super Mario Bros. 3, shown in Figure 15-5, falls into the platform game genre. 
Use the following list to decide whether Super Mario Bros. 3 is a game you 
want to download:
 
 The game in a nutshell: The height of 2-D platform game design.
 
 Gameplay description: If you were fifteen or younger in 1990, chances 
are good that you owned this game, or were at least exposed to it 
through one of the roughly ten million or so kids who did. If you weren’t 
so lucky, then you missed out on a game that improved on the seminal 
run-and-jump gameplay of the original Super Mario Bros. in a variety of 
ways. For one, you could now choose which level to play next through 
a simple map screen. For another, you now had access to a variety 
of transformational suits that helped Mario deal with dozens of new 
enemies. But the most relevant advance of Super Mario Bros. 3 was 
probably the ability to send Mario skyward for the first time by using a 
magic raccoon tail. To this day, the 88 levels of this game represent 
some of the finest design in the history of the medium.

Bomberman ‘93, shown in Figure 15-6, falls into the puzzle/party genre. Use 
the following list to decide whether Bomberman ‘93 is a game you want to 
download:
 
 The game in a nutshell: The golden rule: Blow up others as they would 
blow up you.
 
 Gameplay description: While the Wii is a great system for multiplayer 
party gaming, the folks at Nintendo didn’t single-handedly invent the 
idea in 2006. Multiplayer action has been a part of video games for a long 
time, as proved by the excellent Bomberman ‘93.

286
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 As the name suggests, Bomberman uses his bomb-laying abilities to 
destroy both enemies and the obstacles that prevent him from getting 
to those enemies. The single-player mode in this game is eminently 
forgettable — a slow-paced, uninteresting trek through nondescript, 
sparsely populated levels. That all turns around in multiplayer, where 
up to five players rush around the gridlike levels trying to blow each 
other up. Items can increase your bombing strength and the number of 
bombs you can lay at once, but be careful — the same bombs that can 
destroy your opponents can also be your undoing.
 
 You’ll like it if: You have some friends to play it with.
 
 You won’t like it if: You’re playing the slow-paced single-player mode.
 
 My favorite in-game moment: When one bomb destroys all the 
remaining players, ending a tense duel in a draw.

Use the following list to decide whether Kirby’s Adventure is a game you want 
to download:
 
 The game in a nutshell: Kirby see, Kirby do.
 
 Gameplay description: By the early 90s, it seemed every other game 
that came out was a simple run-and-jump platform game that asked 
some generic character or other to run from one side of the world to the 
other. Kirby stood out from the crowd thanks to a unique design that 
allowed him to swallow and steal the abilities of a wide variety of inter-
esting enemies. With a quick inhale and gulp Kirby can throw bombs, 
wield a sword, transform into a fireball, perform karate moves, and 
much, much more as the situation dictates. A massive selection of levels 
makes this one a bargain for platform game fans.
 
 You’ll like it if: You’re never quite comfortable in your own skin.
 
 You won’t like it if: You like characters with small, easy-to-remember

 The game in a nutshell: Your ticket to a career in the cute-critter-

 Gameplay description: An under-appreciated gem from the end of 
the last millennium, Pokémon Snap sits lonely in the relatively small 
photography simulator genre. As the name implies, you’re tasked with 
taking Safari-style pictures of the animal-like Pokémon in their natural 
habitats (and yes, these are the same Pokémon that briefly took over 
practically every facet of children’s marketing and culture in the late 
90s). A motorized cart pushes you along as you pan and zoom your 
viewfinder to look for the cute critters, which are often hiding in the 
last place you’d think to look.

 If you’re a Pokémon fan, you’ll enjoy at seeing your favorite critters 
cavorting in the wild in full three-dimensional glory. Even if you don’t 
know who or what these things are supposed to be, you’ll enjoy the

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 The game in a nutshell: Er, defend your castle.
 
 Gameplay description: Sometimes the simplest games are the most 
effective. Case in point: Defend Your Castle, a game in which you 
defend a cardboard castle from hordes of rampaging stick figures by 
picking them up and flinging them to the side. It’s hard to undersell how 
satisfying it is to point at a stick figure intruder, pick him up, and send 
him careening to the ground with a satisfying splat.
 
 As the stick figure flow increases from a trickle to a flood, you can 
purchase new allies to help squelch the invasion, ranging from archers 
to disturbingly cute suicide bombers. Strategy isn’t as important as 
rampant clicking and flicking, though. It’s a great way to let off some 
stress — just picture each stick figure as a person or thing that’s causing 
you aggravation and SPLAT.
 
 You’ll like it if: You need to let out some aggression.
 
 You won’t like it if: You have trouble keeping track of a lot of things 
at once.
 
 My favorite in-game moment: Letting the stick figure soldiers amass

Seriously, while the Wii technically comes with everything you need to get 
gaming, you can buy a variety of accessories to make your Wii experience a

actually contain thousands of microscopic memory cells that can hold 
computer data. This includes Wii data, in the form of saved games, 
Channel data, and Message Board messages. (For more on the Wii’s 
internal memory and how to back it up to an SD card, see Chapter 5.)
 
 Why you need it: If your Wii should fail for any reason, an SD backup 
is often the only way to recover the game save data and downloaded 
Channels on your system. You also need a SmartDigital card to transfer 
photos from your digital camera on to the Wii’s Photo Channel (see 
Chapter 8).

294
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 Why you might be able to get by without it: If you’re willing to risk 
losing all the data stored on your Wii in case of a hardware failure, that’s 
your business. Don’t come crying to me when a power surge causes you 
to lose the 30 hours of progress you’ve put in to The Legend of Zelda: 
Twilight Princess though.
 
 Which one to get: SD cards come in a wide variety of sizes. A 512 
Megabyte (512 MB) card is big enough to back up literally everything on 
your Wii’s internal memory. If you plan to use the card for digital photos 
as well, or if you’re planning on using the card for temporary storage 
of data that won’t fit on the Wii’s internal memory, you might want to 
splurge for a bigger card.
 
 Any brand of SD card will work equally well with your Wii, so it’s not 
necessary to pay extra for a card with official Wii branding.
 
Note that some cell phones and cameras use mini- or microSD cards rather 
than the standard-size SD cards. These cards will work with the Wii, but you 
need a special adapter to fit them in the slot in the front of the system. These 
adapters are sold at any major electronics retailer for about $10.
GameCube Memory Card
If you play GameCube games on your Wii, you’ll want to buy a GameCube 
Memory Card.
 
 What is it? These proprietary digital data-storage cards, originally 
designed for Nintendo’s GameCube system, can also be used to save 
GameCube games played on the Wii. (See Chapter 5 for more on playing 
GameCube games on the Wii and using GameCube Memory cards on the 
Wii. Note that you also need a GameCube Controller if you’re planning 
on playing GameCube games on your Wii.)
 
 Why you need it: If you’re going to be playing any GameCube games 
on your Wii, you absolutely need a GameCube Memory Card to save 
your progress. Otherwise, you have to start over from the beginning of 
the game every time you turn the system off. (For games that can take 
dozens and dozens of hours to complete, this doesn’t seem like such a 
great plan.)
 
 Why you can get by without it: If you plan to never, ever buy a 
GameCube game to play on your Wii, then you don’t need to invest in 
a GameCube Memory Card. You’re missing out on hundreds of great 
games, though — many of which can be bought used very cheaply 
these days (see Chapter 11 for more on finding cheap used games).

295
 Chapter 16: Ten Types of Accessories
 
 Which one to get: While Nintendo no longer manufactures new 
GameCube memory cards, you can find unopened and used cards at 
gaming retailers and online at sites such as Amazon and eBay. An 
official, 251-block, Nintendo-made card should run anywhere from $5 to 
$15, roughly. Stay away from any competing cards made by a company 
other than Nintendo; they have a tendency to fail much more often.
Controller Charger
A controller charger is an item you’ll find useful for your Wii.
 
 What is it? For all the great features of the Wii Remote, long-lasting 
battery life is not among them. Nintendo claims a fresh set of alkaline 
AA batteries will last up to 35 hours in your Remote, but in practice the 
batteries tend to die out around the ten- to fifteen-hour mark. A specially 
designed controller charger is the most cost-efficient and environmen-
tally friendly way to make sure your Remote always has juice.
 
 Why you need it: Not only will a battery charger save you money and 
help reduce toxic waste from disposable batteries, but it’s also a lot 
more convenient. A charger makes sure your Wii Remote is always ready 
to use at a moment’s notice, without the need to swap out batteries in 
the middle of an intense play session.
 
 Why you can get by without it: If you don’t use the Wii that often, you 
might not find much of a need for a Remote charger. That said, you 
should be using your Wii more often. This book is full of fun and useful 
things to do with your system. Pick up your Remote and give them a try, 
for goodness sakes!
 
 Which one to get: I personally use the Nyko Charge Station, which 
comes with two Nickel-Metal Hydride battery packs and a stylish charg-
ing base station that charges both of them at once. The base station also 
has convenient LED lights to show when your Remotes are fully charged. 
Not bad for $30.
 
 There are a wide variety of competing Remote chargers from a wide 
variety of companies. Some plug into the wall, while others plug into 
the USB port in the back of the Wii, drawing power from the system to 
charge the Remotes. Of course, you could always just buy some plain 
old, rechargeable AA batteries for your Remote, but then you have 
to constantly swap them in and out of the Remote. And who wants to 
do that?

296
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Decorative System Skins
While the Wii is pretty stylish by itself, some people find the system’s 
sleek white exterior too boring. If you’re one of these people, you can buy a 
decorative skin for your system.
 
 What is it? Tired of that plain, white Wii clashing with the rest of your 
entertainment center? Dress up that drab facade with some decora-
tive plastic skins. These high-quality stickers go right on top of the Wii 
casing, turning your basic system into a work of art. Some even come 
with matching stickers for your Wii Remote and Nunchuk so you can 
keep everything color-coordinated. (Now, that’s what I call fashion-
forward.)
 
 Why you need it: If you feel a deep, abiding need to jazz up your 
electronics.
 
 Why you can get by without it: If you enjoy the simple, clean look of the 
basic Wii system.
 
 Which one to get: You can order skins from www.DecalGirl.com and 
www.PimpMyWii.com — both have an excellent selection of Wii system 
and controller skins in the $5 to $15 range.
Travel Cases
If you want to take your Wii with you when you visit friends or when you 
travel, you may want to buy a travel case.
 
 What is it? Kind of like a suitcase for your Wii, a specially designed 
travel case makes it much easier to bring your new system over to a 
friend’s house for some multiplayer fun.
 
 Why you need it: If you’re the only one of your friends who owns a Wii, 
and you find yourself constantly asked to bring the system over for 
cookouts, parties, Bar Mitzvahs, and so on.
 
 Why you can get by without it: If all your friends have Wiis of their own 
to play. Or if none of your friends are very interested in having you bring 
your system over to their place. Or if you have no friends.
 
 Which one to get: You can find a wide variety of Wii travel cases that 
vary greatly in design and price. Intec’s Pro Gamer case is probably the 
top of the line, with a hard, metal case that includes compartments for 
controllers, cables, and games for about $30. If you’re looking for some-
thing a little less pricey, the DreamGear Wii Game Bag is a soft mesh 
alternative that can hold your Wii and all its accessories for about $15.

297
 Chapter 16: Ten Types of Accessories
Classic Controller Shells
You might find a Classic Controller shell useful if you play a lot of download-
able classics on the Wii’s Virtual Console.
 
 What is it? These plastic controller shells snap on to the Wii Classic 
Controller or Wii Remote, making them easier to hold and use for 
big-handed players.
 
 Why you need it: If you play a lot of games on the Virtual Console or a 
lot of games that require you to hold the Wii Remote in the horizontal 
position.
 
 Why you can get by without it: If you can comfortably hold the Wii 
Remote and/or Wii Classic Controller in your hands without any 
attachments.
 
 Which one to get: There are really only two choices here: Nyko’s Classic 
Controller Grip adds more room for your palms and a convenient holder 
for the dangling wire and attached Wii Remote, all for only roughly 
$10. For players using the Wii Remote in the horizontal position, CTA 
Digital’s Wii Remote Grip adds a similar palm-friendly area to the edges 
of the Remote, also for $10.
Controller Sleeves
A variety of controller sleeves in various colors, such as pink and blue, are 
available for your Wii Remote and Nunchuk.
 
 What is it? Controller sleeves are silicone shells that cover the Wii 
Remote and Nunchuk. The hard, plastic shells of the Wii Remote and 
Nunchuk not only make the controllers prone to breaking in serious 
impacts, but they also make the controllers hurt when they inevitably 
bonk someone in the head during gameplay. Controller sleeves can help 
alleviate both these problems by adding a squishy layer that protects 
the controllers from both breaking and bonking. These sleeves also 
make the controllers easier to grip and less prone to slipping out of 
sweaty hands.
 
 Why you need it: If you’re concerned with the health and safety of your 
Wii Remote and its owner.
 
 Why you can get by without it: If you’re the kind of devil-may-care rebel 
that willingly wears the same pair of underwear two days in a row.

298
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 Which one to get: Nintendo’s free, official Wii Remote sleeve has cut 
into the market for non-free sleeves somewhat, but plenty of companies 
still market sleeves of their own. While they’re infinitely more expen-
sive, these sleeves have the advantage of being much less bulky than 
Nintendo’s free Wii Remote sleeves and come in a wide variety of stylish 
colors. One brand is largely like all the others, truth be told; prices range 
from $1 to $5 per sleeve.
 
For something a little different, Nerf makes a controller shell from its trade-
mark foam. It’s a little bulkier than its plain silicone counterparts and more 
expensive, but it might be worth it just for the coolness factor alone.
Wireless Sensor Bar
A wireless sensor bar might be useful if your entertainment setup requires 
you to put the sensor bar too far away from the Wii system.
 
 What is it? While the Sensor Bar that comes with the Wii plugs into 
the back of the system, it doesn’t actually send any data to the system 
directly. The only reason for that overly long plug is to draw power for 
the Wii Sensor Bar’s infrared lights, which are detected by a simple 
digital camera in the Wii Remote.
 
 What all this technical mumbo-jumbo means is that there’s no reason a 
wireless, battery powered sensor bar couldn’t work just as well as the 
official wired version included in the Wii box. Given the tangled mess of 
cable behind most TVs these days, one less wire to snag is likely to be a 
welcome development.
 
 Why you need it: If you want one less wire snaking around your enter-
tainment center. The wireless sensor bar can also be placed much 
farther from the system, which is useful for some entertainment setups 
that use a projector and screen.
 
 Why you can get by without it: If your default Wii Sensor Bar is working 
just fine, wires and all.
 
 Which one to get: Intec, Nyko, and DreamGear all make wireless sensor 
bars that are relatively hard to distinguish from one another. All three 
cost about $15 at retail.
Cooling Fans
A cooling fan is probably not necessary for your Wii (unless you really like to 
crank up the heat in your play area).

299
 Chapter 16: Ten Types of Accessories
 
 What is it? Somewhere along the way, someone must have gotten 
the idea that Wiis the world over are overheating at a tremendous 
rate. While the outside of the Wii does indeed get hot if left on for an 
extended period, the natural ventilation provided by the included stand 
and the slots throughout the case are generally enough to keep the 
system running properly. Still, for those nervous nellies out there, you 
can find a variety of attachable, USB-powered fans and stands to blow 
that heated air away from the system at a much faster rate.
 
 Why you need it: If you routinely play your Wii in 140-degree heat.
 
 Why you can get by without it: If your Wii is set up in a cool, well-
ventilated area.
 
 Which one to avoid: While all Wii cooling fans are pretty much equally 
useless, Ascend’s $30 attachment packs the double punch of being more 
expensive than its competitors and much, much cheaper-looking. 
Stay away.
Plastic Remote Attachments
Other accessories that you probably can do without are plastic remote 
attachments.
 
 What are they? It seems some people just aren’t satisfied with having 
their Wii Remote act like a virtual version of a sword, golf club, tennis 
racquet, baseball bat, or other real-world device. No, these people 
won’t be happy unless their Wii Remote actually looks like a cheap, 
plastic version of the handheld tool it’s emulating. Plenty of accessory 
makers are willing to take these people’s money by making and market-
ing plastic attachments that attach to the Wii Remote, transforming it 
from a well-designed piece of electronics to something that looks like a 
cheap children’s toy. These attachments don’t add any functionality to 
the Remote, and they don’t even make the games easier to play. They’re 
just a waste of space, time, and money, really.
 
 Why you need it: If you always wanted a toy sword as a child but your 
non-violent parents wouldn’t let you have one.
 
 Why you can get by without it: If you have an imagination.
 
 Which one to avoid: Of all the Wii Remote attachments currently on 
the market, the Wii Billiards cue is probably the most ostentatious and 
useless. Even if you’re one of the few fans of the Billiards mini-game in 
Wii Play, you can probably get by without this attachment.
