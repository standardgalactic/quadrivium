Introduction
H
i there, and welcome to BlackBerry Pearl For Dummies.
Having purchased a BlackBerry Pearl, this is a great book to
have around if you want to discover new features or you need
something to slap open and use as a quick reference. If you don’t
have a BlackBerry Pearl yet (but plan to get one) and have some
basic questions (such as “What is a BlackBerry Pearl?” or “How
can a Pearl help me be more productive?”), you can benefit by
reading this book cover to cover. Regardless of your current
BlackBerry User Status — BUS, for short — we’re here to help you
get the most out of your BlackBerry.
We can tell you, right off the bat, that a BlackBerry Pearl is not a
fruit you find at the supermarket nor a jewel. Rather, it is an
always-connected handheld device that has e-mail capabilities with
a built-in Internet browser and the latest in convergent smart
phones with advanced media features and a camera. With your
BlackBerry, you are in the privileged position of always being able
to receive e-mail, browse the Web, and have fun listening to music
and taking pictures.
On top of that, a BlackBerry has all the features you’d expect from
a personal organizer, including a calendar, to-do lists, and memos.
Oh, and did we mention that a BlackBerry also has a mobile phone
built in? Talk about multitasking! Imagine being stuck on a com-
muter train: With your BlackBerry by your side, you can compose
e-mail while conducting a conference call — all from the comfort of
your seat.
In this book, we show you all the basics but then go the extra mile
by highlighting some of the lesser-known (but still handy) features
of the Pearl. Your Pearl can work hard for you when you need it as
well as play hard when you want it to.
About This Book
BlackBerry Pearl For Dummies is written to be a comprehensive
user guide as well as a quick user reference. This book is designed
so that you certainly can read it cover to cover if you want, but

you don’t need to. Feel free to jump around while you explore the
different functionalities of your BlackBerry. We cover basic and
advanced topics, but we stick to those that we consider the most
practical and frequently used. Also, we provide ample screen
images so that you can relate to the topics even when you’re not
holding your BlackBerry Pearl. Screen images used throughout the
book are based on the T-Mobile Zen theme and may vary if you are
not using this theme.
Who Are You?
In writing this book, we tried to be considerate of your needs, but
because we’ve never met you, our image of you is as follows. If you
find that some of these images are true about you, this might just
be the book for you:
 You have a BlackBerry Pearl, and you want to find out how to
get the most from it. Or you don’t have a BlackBerry Pearl yet,
and you’re wondering what one could do for you.
 You want to take advantage of the many fun features of your
BlackBerry Pearl, including taking pictures, listening to music,
and watching video clips.
 You’re looking for a book that doesn’t assume you know all
the jargon and tech terms used in the PDA industry. (PDA
stands for personal digital assistant, by the way.) Take that,
you jargon, you!
 You want a reference that shows you, step by step, how to do
useful and cool things with a BlackBerry without bogging you
down with unnecessary background or theory.
 You’re tired of hauling your ten-pound laptop with you on
trips, and you’re wondering how to turn your BlackBerry into
a miniature traveling office.
 You no longer want to be tied to your desktop system for the
critical activities in your life, such as sending and receiving
e-mail, checking your calendar for appointments, and surfing
the Web.
What’s in This Book
BlackBerry Pearl For Dummies consists of five parts, and each part
consists of chapters related to that part’s theme.
BlackBerry Pearl For Dummies 
2

Part I: Meet and Greet 
Your BlackBerry Pearl
Part I starts with the basics of your BlackBerry Pearl. You know:
What it is, what you can do with it, and what the parts are. We also
show you how to personalize and express yourself through your
BlackBerry. This part wraps up with must-knows about security
and where to go for help when you get into trouble with your
BlackBerry.
Part II: Getting Organized 
with Your Pearl
Part II deals with the fact that your BlackBerry is also a full-fledged
PDA. We show you how to get your BlackBerry to keep your con-
tacts in its Address Book as well as how to manage your appoint-
ments and meetings in Calendar. We also show you how to take
some notes and safely keep your passwords. As you’ll see, most
BlackBerry applications interconnect, working hard for you.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and
Online with Your Pearl
Part III shows you how you can use the true strengths of the
BlackBerry — its always-connected e-mail and its Web surfing 
functionality — but it doesn’t stop there. We also point out how you
can use other forms of messages on the BlackBerry that you might
not have known about, such as PIN-to-PIN messages, BlackBerry
Messenger, and Instant Messaging from the popular IM networks.
We feature the ability of your BlackBerry Pearl to capture cool pic-
tures and, to top it off, satisfy your senses by playing media files
such as music and video clips.
Part IV: Working with 
Desktop Manager
In Part IV, we detail the BlackBerry Desktop Manager and show you
some of the hoops you can put it through with your Pearl, includ-
ing making backups. And we didn’t forget to cover important stuff
such as data-syncing your appointments and contacts with desk-
top applications such as Outlook.
Introduction

Part V: The Part of Tens
All For Dummies books include The Part of Tens at the end, and
this book is no different. In Part V, we show you where to get cool
BlackBerry accessories and download useful applications.
Icons in This Book
This book rarely delves into the geeky, technical details, but when
it does, this icon warns you. Read on if you want to get under the
hood a little, or just skip ahead if you aren’t interested in the gory
details.
Here’s where you can find not-so-obvious tricks that can make you
a BlackBerry power user in no time. Pay special attention to the
paragraphs with this icon to get the most out of your BlackBerry.
Look out! This icon tells you how to avoid trouble before it starts.
This icon highlights an important point that you don’t want to
forget because it just might come up again. We’d never be so cruel
as to spring a pop quiz on you, but paying attention to these
details can definitely help you.

ecause you’re reading this book, you probably have a
BlackBerry Pearl (um, and we’re pretty sure that you’re not
eating it). We’re just curious, though — what convinced you to buy
this particular handheld mobile device? Was it the always-connected
e-mail? Or the 1.3 mega-pixel camera? Or the microSD slot capabil-
ity? Or was it the really good sales pitch? We know; the list could
go on and on — and we might never hit on the exact reason why
you got yours. For whatever reason you bought your BlackBerry
Pearl, congratulations; you made an intelligent choice.
The same smarts that made you buy your Pearl are clearly at it
again. This time, your native intelligence led you to pick up this
book, perhaps because your intuition is telling you that there’s
more to this whole BlackBerry than meets the eye.
Your hunch is right. Your BlackBerry can help you do more things
than you could ever think of. For example, your BlackBerry is a
whiz at making phone calls, but it’s also a computer that you can
use to check your e-mail as well as surf the Web. We’re talking
World Wide Web here, so the sky’s the limit. Help is always at your
fingertips rather than sitting on some desk at home or at the office.
Need to check out the reviews of that restaurant on the corner?
Need to see (right now) what’s showing in your local movie the-
aters, or what the weather will be like later tonight, or the best
place to shop? Need to get directions to that cozy bed and break-
fast, or news headlines, or stock quotes? Want to do some online

chatting or view some pictures online and download them? You
can do all these things (and more) by using your BlackBerry.
BlackBerry Pearl is also a full-fledged personal digital assistant
(PDA). Out of the box, it provides you with the organizational tools
you need to set up to-do lists, manage your appointments, take
care of your address books, and more.
Being armed with a device that’s a sleek phone, a camera, a portal
flash drive, an Internet connection, and a PDA all built into one
makes you a power person. With your BlackBerry (along with this
resourceful book), you really can improve your productivity, better
organize yourself, and increase your cool factor. Watch out, world!
Person bearing a BlackBerry Pearl coming through!
If you stick with us throughout this book, you’ll find out all you
need to get the most out of your device or maybe even stave off
(or save) a troubled relationship. (Well, the last one is a bit of an
exaggeration, but we got your attention, right?)
Knowing Your BlackBerry History
Your BlackBerry Pearl is truly a wondrous device, boasting many
features beyond your ordinary mobile phone. And its “sudden”
popularity didn’t happen overnight. Like any other good product
out there, BlackBerry Pearl has come a long way from its (rela-
tively humble) beginnings.
In the days when the Palm Pilot ruled the PDA world, Research in
Motion (RIM, the maker of the BlackBerry) was busy in its lab,
ignoring the then-popular graffiti input method to design its own
device with the QWERTY keyboard — the kind of keyboard people
were already used to from working on their PCs. RIM didn’t stop
there, however. It also added an always-connected e-mail capabil-
ity, making this device a must-have among government officials as
well as professionals in the finance and health industries.
To meet the needs of government officials and industry profession-
als, RIM made reliability, security, and durability the priorities
when manufacturing its devices. Today, the BlackBerry Pearl
comes from the same line of RIM family products, inheriting all the
good genes while boosting usability and especially multimedia
capabilities. As a result, BlackBerry Pearl has become the hippest
smart-phone — and no longer just for big corporate hot-shots and
government officials.

How It Works: The Schematic
Approach
For those of you who always ask, “How do they do that?” you don’t
have to go far; this little section is just for you.
The role of the network 
service provider
Along with wondering how your BlackBerry actually works, you
might also be wondering why you didn’t get your BlackBerry from
RIM instead of a network service provider such as Cingular or T-
Mobile? Why did you need to go through a middle-person? After
all, RIM makes BlackBerry.
Those are excellent questions — and here’s a quick-and-dirty
answer. RIM needs a delivery system — a communication medium,
as it were — for its technology to work. Not in a position to come
up with such a delivery system all by its lonesome, RIM partnered
(and built alliances across the globe) with what developed into its
network service providers — the usual suspects (meaning the big
cellphone companies).
These middle-providers support the wireless network for your
BlackBerry so that you have signals to connect to the BlackBerry
Internet Service — which means you can get all those wonderful
e-mails (and waste so much valuable time surfing the Internet). See
Figure 1-1 for a schematic overview of this process.
Network service providers don’t build alliances for nothing, right?
In return, RIM gave them the right to brand their names on the
BlackBerry they offer for sale. For example, a T-Mobile Pearl may
look different from a similar model you would get from Vodafone.
Which leads to another question: Do BlackBerry functionalities
differ from phone model to phone model? Quick answer: In the
core BlackBerry applications (such as Tasks and Address Book),
you find no major differences. However, some BlackBerry features,
such as Instant Messaging, might or might not be supported by the
network service provider. (See Chapter 8 for more details on
Instant Messaging.)

Figure 1-1: Your e-mail travels to your BlackBerry via service providers.
Connecting to your 
personal computer
Nowadays, a personal computer is a household necessity. We
spend so much time on them, and so much information is stored 
in them. It should come as no surprise that BlackBerry works
hand-in-hand with your PC. The USB cable that comes with your
BlackBerry does more than just charge your device. All the chap-
ters in Part IV are dedicated to guiding you in making use of this
important connection with the help of the BlackBerry Desktop
Manager and all the utilities that come with it. You find discussions
in Chapter 13 on how to sync your device with the Personal Infor-
mation Manager data that you keep in your PC. Chapter 14 guides
you on how to back up almost anything in your BlackBerry, down
to your desktop. Lastly, Chapter 15 shows you how to use the Pearl
and its microSD slot as storage that goes where you go.
Doing the BlackBerry 
world-traveler thing
If you purchased your Pearl from T-Mobile or Cingular, chances are
that your BlackBerry Pearl will continue to work when you travel

to, say, London or Beijing. All you need to worry about is turning
on your Pearl (and maybe the extra roaming charges). Because
your BlackBerry Pearl is quad band, it will work in more than 90
different countries.
What is quad band? Basically, different cellphone networks in dif-
ferent countries operate in different frequencies. For example, the
United States operates two frequencies: 850 and 1900 MHz; Canada,
850 and 1900 MHz; Europe and Asia Pacific, 900 and 1800 MHz. Your
Pearl is designed to work in these four frequencies — 850/900/
1800/1900 MHz — so you are covered no matter where you go.
Well, almost. Check with your network service provider before you
hop on a plane just to be sure.
Two dominant technologies compete in the worldwide cellphone
industry today:
 Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA): This is available in
the United States through Verizon Wireless.
 Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM): This is a
tad older than its CDMA rival. This is available in the United
States through Cingular and T-Mobile.
Nothing stands still in this world, and this saying is proven by the
fact that GSM has spawned Global Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and
EDGE, a second-generation technology that has been growing in
popularity because it works on the same GSM phone infrastruc-
ture. This combo GSM/GPRS is also available in the United States
through most of the major network service providers. As you
might have guessed, GSM/GPRS competes in the marketplace
against CDMA.
Why is this a factor? Or, to put this more bluntly, what’s it to you?
Well, because CDMA and GSM/GPRS aren’t compatible — which is
what happens when you have competing technologies going for all
the marbles in the marketplace — your phone works on only one
technology. When you travel outside North America, you face the
burning question: “CDMA or GSM/GPRS?” (The non-acronym ver-
sion of this question is, “Will my BlackBerry work on this country’s
network or won’t it?”) If you currently work with GSM/GPRS, you
should be okay because most non-North American countries are
on GSM/GPRS networks. If you’re a CDMA kind of person, you might
have some “issues,” as they say. When in doubt, talk to your net-
work service provider.
Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is Not an Edible Fruit 11

Oh, the Things You Can Do!
Unlike the traditional BlackBerry, your Pearl is a work of art when it
comes to smart phones. But besides its looks, the always-connected
e-mail is likely first in the long list of reasons why you got your Pearl
in the first place. And, if you need to go global, you can use your
BlackBerry in 90+ countries. Just hop off your flight, turn on your
Pearl, and voilà!: e-mails on your Pearl while you’re 6000 miles away
from home. See the earlier “Doing the BlackBerry world-traveler
thing” section for more info.) Generally speaking, you can receive
and send e-mails just like when you’re at home.
Although e-mail is Pearl’s strength, that’s not the only thing it can
do. This section goes beyond e-mail to point out some of the other
major benefits you can get from your device.
All-in-one multimedia center
Before the BlackBerry Pearl arrived on the scene, many consumers
were hesitant about purchasing a BlackBerry due to the lack of
multimedia functions such as a camera and audio playback. The
Pearl changed all that, with more features than a typical consumer
might expect. Not only does the Pearl have a high-resolution, 1.3
mega-pixel camera (see Chapter 11), but it also has a memory slot
for a microSD chip (see Chapter 15). That means your Pearl can
function as an mp3 player, a portal video player, a portable flash
drive, and your personal photo collection (see Chapter 11). It’s like
having an iPod and then some. Can your iPod do the following?
Internet at your fingertips
Yup, you can browse the Web with your Pearl. Even better, you can
continue chatting with your friends through Instant Messenger, just
as though you never left your desktop computer (see Chapter 8).
You can also get up-to-the-minute information when you want it,
when you need it. Imagine getting an alert when your stock is tank-
ing. True, that’s not a good thing to happen, but this information is
critical if you want to act in a timely manner.
If you’re not into stocks, how about getting sports and weather
information? Or maybe traffic alerts? Say you want to know the
best restaurants in town for that special evening — birthday,
anniversary, first date. Many services that are available on the
Internet are available to you also on your Pearl.

With the growing popularity of the device, software developers
outside RIM are taking advantage of this growing market — which
means literally hundreds of applications are now out there for you
to download.
Download? Absolutely! BlackBerry supports the downloading of
applications and games through the BlackBerry Browser. And of
course, it’s wireless. For example, you can download more produc-
tivity tools such as spreadsheet applications or an exciting game of
Texas-Hold ’em. The number of BlackBerry applications and games
is growing — and growing fast.
To be honest, there’s no way to foresee how many applications will
be on the market when this book is published. And the price of an
application varies, depending on how sophisticated the program
is, so we can’t give firm numbers. But if you’re curious, check out
Part V, where we describe some of the best applications and games
out there.
Intrigued? Your questions about how your Pearl can take advan-
tage of the Web and wireless download are answered in due time
(in Chapter 9, to be precise).
Me and my great personal assistant
You might be saying, “But I’m really a busy person, and I don’t have
time to browse the Web. What I do need is an assistant to help me
better organize my day-to-day tasks.” If you can afford one, by all
means go ahead and hire a personal assistant. If not, the next best
thing is a personal digital assistant (PDA). Many PDAs are on the
market today; the most popular ones are marketed by Palm and
WinCE. Getting a PDA can be a big help — and much less expensive
than hiring a secretary.
So, are we telling you to go out and buy a PDA? No way! Put away
that credit card because you don’t need to go that route.
Whip out your Pearl and take a closer look. That’s right, your Pearl
is also a full-fledged PDA, able to help you remember all your
acquaintances (see Chapter 4), manage your appointments
(Chapter 5), keep a to-do list (Chapter 6), and much more.
Me and my chatty self
With all the features just described above, your Pearl is also a full-
featured phone. With voice dialing, and the ability to carry out 
Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is Not an Edible Fruit 13

conference calls with you as the moderator, your Pearl isn’t like
other cellphones out there. To learn more about your Pearl Phone,
see Chapter 10.
Look, Dad, no hands!
Your BlackBerry comes equipped with an earphone that doubles
as a mike for hands-free talking. This accessory is your doctor’s
prescription for preventing the stiff neck that comes from wedging
your BlackBerry with your shoulder against your ear. At the very
minimum, it helps free your hands so you can eat Chinese takeout.
And, if you happen to be a New York resident, you’re required by
law to use an earphone while driving when you use a cellphone. (Not
that we recommend using your cellphone while driving, but if you
really need to make that call, going hands-free is better and safer.)
But RIM didn’t stop with just your standard (wired) earphones.
BlackBerry also supports cool, new wireless earphones/mikes —
the ones based on Bluetooth technology. “But how could a bizarrely
colored tooth help me here?” you might ask. Fooled you! Bluetooth
is a codename for a (very) short-distance wireless technology first
used to connect simple devices such as computer accessories, but
that is now becoming more common on cellphones, specifically on
wireless earphones/mikes.
Final BlackBerry Tidbits
The main concerns most of us have when buying a product are
quality and reliability. Will the product last? Will it perform as the
flier says? Will I regret having bought this item six months down
the road? This section looks at some of the hardware features that
make buying the BlackBerry Pearl a wise purchase.
Power efficiency
Now, anyone who has had an ear to the ground regarding BlackBerry
knows its reputation as a highly efficient little machine when it
comes to power consumption. Even with the addition of colored
and high-resolution screens, the power consumption of the Pearl
still has a 15-day standby time and close to 4 hours talk time. So,
when the salesperson offers you a special deal on a second bat-
tery, simply tell him or her that you’ll think about it. With the
Pearl’s standard battery, you’ll have more than enough power.

Memory management
When you first receive your BlackBerry Pearl, the device definitely
has ample free memory. However, that memory — which is used
for applications that come with your Pearl and for other applica-
tions you download — does not grow as you use BlackBerry.
You’re stuck with a fixed amount of memory, which can prove limit-
ing over time. As you install more and more applications, this free
memory gets used up. In fact, you could eventually run out of
memory altogether.
Don’t confuse this fixed amount of memory with the memory avail-
able through the microSD slot. A microSD chip can store mp3s, port-
able videos and pictures that you download or load from your PC.
Does your device die when you run out of memory? No, thank good-
ness. Your BlackBerry is capable of monitoring the free memory on
your device. If you’re ever in danger of reaching your upper limits,
the BlackBerry has a memory management tool that cleans house
to free this limited resource.
BlackBerry applications right out of the box are capable of figuring
out what data isn’t that important. For example, the BlackBerry
Browser caches data to enhance your experience when browsing
the Web. Caches use local copies of Web pages to speed up the
reloading of previously visited Web sites, so they are generally
good things to have around. However, this cache also takes up
space. When the OS tells Browser that the device is reaching its
upper memory limit and that it needs to do some house cleaning,
Browser deletes this cache. This is also true for Message, which
deletes e-mails you’ve already read, starting from the oldest and
working its way backward.
Curious about how much available space your device has? From
the Home screen, press the Menu key, scroll to highlight Options in
the list of applications, and press the trackball. Scroll through the
list and click Status. In the Status screen, File Free is the field that
tells you how much available space is left.
A sentry is always on duty
Throughout the history of human existence, we’ve seen some nasty
things that human beings are capable of doing. Unfortunately, the
virtual world is not exempt; in fact, every day a battle is fought
between those who are trying to attack a system and those who
Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is Not an Edible Fruit 15

are trying to protect it. Included among those attacking the system
are those who are trying to steal corporate data for their advan-
tage, as well as individuals trying to steal personal data to carry
out identity theft.
A computer connected to the Internet faces an extra risk of being
hacked or becoming infected by a computer virus intent on simply
annoying the heck out of you or (even worse) wreaking havoc on
your computer. Fortunately, security is one of the strong points of
the BlackBerry. RIM has built into its software features that allow
companies to curtail activities for their BlackBerry users that they
deem risky, such as installing or running a third-party application.
Data transmitted on and from the device are encrypted so that
possible snooping is prevented. RIM also has a Signature process
for application developers, which forces developers to identify
themselves and their programs if they are developing any applica-
tions running on the BlackBerry platform that need to integrate
with either BlackBerry core applications or the OS.
The security measures RIM implemented on the BlackBerry plat-
form have gained the trust of the U.S. government as well as many
of the Forbes Top 500 enterprises in the financial and health 
industries.
Remember the I love you and Anna Kournikova viruses? These are
virtual evils transmitted through e-mail, a script, or sets of instruc-
tions in the e-mail body or attachment that can be executed either
by the host e-mail program or, in the case of an attachment, by the
program associated with the attached file. Fortunately, BlackBerry’s
Messages does not support scripting languages. As for attachments,
out of the box BlackBerry supports few file types, mostly images
and text documents. BlackBerry’s viewer for such files doesn’t sup-
port scripting either, so you won’t be facing threats from e-mails
having these attachments.

Navigating the Pearl
In This Chapter
 Understanding Pearl basics
 Navigating with your Pearl
You might have heard that the BlackBerry Pearl is different
from all other BlackBerry handhelds that came before. Yes,
the Pearl is a lot slimmer than other BlackBerry handhelds. Yes, it
has a built-in 1.3 megapixel camera. And yes, it has a microSD
memory slot. But what makes it fundamentally different is the fact
that it has a trackball.
Where is the trackball? What can you do with it? How can you navi-
gate your BlackBerry Pearl better with the trackball? Those are some
of the questions that we address in this chapter. Bear with us and
you will be master of your BlackBerry Pearl trackball in no time.
Anatomy 101
Together with the trackball, a few important keys will help you
master navigating your BlackBerry Pearl. Figure 2-1 labels all the
major keys and features on your Pearl.
The major features of your Pearl follow:
 Display screen: The graphical user interface (GUI) of your
BlackBerry Pearl.
 SureType keyboard: The input for your BlackBerry Pearl.
 Escape key: This key is used to either cancel a selection or
return to a previous page within an application (for example,
the Browser).

Figure 2-1: Main BlackBerry Pearl features.
 Menu key: This is used to bring up the full menu of the appli-
cation you are using (see Figure 2-2, left).
If you owned a BlackBerry before, you might have noticed
that the Menu key is new. The Menu key basically replaces the
trackwheel click.
 Trackball: You navigate the display screen of your BlackBerry
Pearl with the trackball. You have four directional movements.
When you press on the trackball, a short menu of the applica-
tion you’re using appears (see Figure 2-2, right).

 Left and right convenience keys: By default, the left conven-
ience key brings up the voice-dialing application. The right
convenience key brings up the camera. In Chapter 3, you find
out how to program these two keys so they bring up the pro-
grams you use the most.
 MicroSD slot: Although it’s hidden inside your BlackBerry
Pearl and can be revealed only by removing the battery, your
Pearl’s microSD slot is a crucial element to your media experi-
ence on your Pearl.
Figure 2-2: A full menu (left) and a short menu (right) in the Message application.
Display screen
When you first turn on your Pearl, the display screen displays 
the Home screen, which is your introduction to the GUI of your
BlackBerry Pearl. The five icons represent the different applica-
tions in your BlackBerry Pearl. Refer to Figure 2-3 for examples of
what your Home screen might look like.
Figure 2-3: Your BlackBerry Pearl might come with a different default theme.
Chapter 2: Navigating the Pearl 19

Depending on the theme you’re using, you might see applications
listed in text form rather than as icons. How your GUI looks depends
on how you want it to look, because the font and theme are customiz-
able. For more on personalizing your BlackBerry, see Chapter 3.
SureType keyboard
The Pearl doesn’t have a full QWERTY keyboard. Rather, it works
with a QWERTY-based keyboard known as the SureType keyboard.
The idea here is that many keys share letters (refer to Figure 2-1)
and that the SureType technology is smart enough to learn what
key combinations are necessary for the words you want. Basically,
with SureType, you can now type with only one thumb, and your
BlackBerry Pearl learns the words that you use frequently.
Here are tips to speed up the learning curve when using SureType
technology:
 Always finish typing a word before correcting it. This way,
SureType learns what you want to type the next time.
 If SureType got the word you’re typing right on the first try,
use the SPACE key to move on instead of clicking the track-
ball or pressing Enter.
 Take advantage of Custom Wordlist, which is a list of words
defined by you. We describe this feature in a moment.
 Type! Type! Type! Because SureType learns how you type,
the more you use it, the smarter it becomes in adapting to
your style.
SureType versus multitap
On your Pearl, other than SureType, you can type in another mode:
multitap. The regular way — at least we think of it as the regular
way — is the multitap approach. The best way to explain multitap
is by example: Say you want to type an h character on your Pearl.
You search out the h on your keyboard but then notice to your
dismay that the h shares a key with the letter g. What’s a person to
do? Do you really want to go through life writing GHello for Hello?
Actually, there’s a perfectly easy solution to your problem. To get
to the letter g, you tap the GH key once. To get the letter h — the
second letter in the key’s pair — you tap the key twice — hence,
the term multitap.
To switch between multitap and SureType while you’re typing,
press the * key.
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Pearl 
20

What about SureType? When you’re in SureType mode, your Pearl
tries to help you do the communication thing by figuring out what
word you are typing. For example, if you want to type the word hi,
you start by pressing the GH key and then the UI key. Doing so
prompts SureType to display a list of words it thinks might be what
you’re aiming for, as shown in Figure 2-4.
Figure 2-4: Now, did you want to type hi or gi?
If the first listed word is what you want, simply press the SPACE
key. The word is automatically selected, and you can continue to
type. If what you really wanted to type appears a little later in the
list, simply scroll to it using the trackball and select it by pressing
the trackball. Over time, SureType learns the words you’re most
likely to use and sticks those at the front of the list. Yup, that’s
right — it gets smarter the more you use it.
Custom Wordlist
SureType keeps all the words it has learned in a safe place — a
Wordlist, to be precise. It turns out that you can review your
SureType Wordlist — and even add to it — using the Custom
Wordlist option. (Using this option to add words or proper names
to the list means that SureType doesn’t have to learn them when
you’re in the act of typing.)
To see or add words using the Custom Wordlist option, follow
these steps:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Options.
2. Select Custom Wordlist.
This opens Custom Wordlist, where you can see all the words
that SureType has learned. (If just got your BlackBerry
recently, the list might have no words or only a few.)
Chapter 2: Navigating the Pearl 21

3. Press the Menu key and select New.
A dialog box appears, prompting you to type a new word,
as shown in Figure 2-5.
Figure 2-5: Adding our favorite btw to the Custom Wordlist.
4. Type a custom word that you want to add and press the
trackball.
This adds your word and saves it to the Custom Wordlist.
SureType has a tough time getting people’s names right, but thank-
fully, you can make sure all the names in your Address Book are
automatically learned by SureType by doing the following:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Options.
2. Select Language.
You see the Language option screen, where the handy Input
Option button makes its home.
3. Scroll to the Input Option button and select it.
The Fast Options screen appears with the following options:
• Frequency Learning: If turned on, the word used most 
frequently appears first in the SureType word list while
you type.
• Auto Word Learning: If turned on, SureType learns as 
you type.
• Use Address Book as Data Source: If turned on, SureType
learns all the names in your Address Book.
4. Make sure the Use Address Book as Data Source option is
turned on.
If it isn’t, scroll to this field, press the trackball, and select
On from the drop-down list.

ing Save.
Escape key
A simple yet useful key, the Escape key allows you to return to a
previous screen or cancel a selection.
Trackball — a.k.a. the Pearl
The BlackBerry Pearl got its name because of the little white
translucent trackball. The trackball has two functions: scrolling
and pressing. Both are described in this section.
Scrolling with your trackball
The trackball allows you to navigate the display screen in up to
four directions. In a text-filled screen such as body of an e-mail,
you can navigate through the text usually in all directions.
Pressing down on your trackball
Depending on where you are on the BlackBerry Pearl’s screen, dif-
ferent situations determine what happens when you press down on
the trackball, an action known as the trackball click:
 Displays a drop-down list: When you’re in a choice field,
pressing the trackball displays a drop-down list.
 Confirms a choice: The trackball can function as a confirma-
tion key. For example, in a drop-down list, press the trackball
to confirm the highlighted choice.
 Displays a short menu: In a text-filled screen (an e-mail body
or a Web page), pressing the trackball displays a short menu
(See Figure 2-2 right). The short menu is an abbreviated ver-
sion of the full menu, which you can see by pressing the 
Menu key.
Menu key
As you can see in Figure 2-1, the Menu key is located to the left of
the trackball. When you’re on the Home screen, pressing the Menu
key displays a popup screen listing applications installed on your
BlackBerry Pearl. See Chapter 3 for instructions on how to change
the order of the applications listed in the popup.
Chapter 2: Navigating the Pearl 23

The behavior of the Menu key when the Home screen is displayed
depends on the BlackBerry Pearl theme. The behavior just described
is based on the default theme. To choose another theme, see
Chapter 3.
When you’re in an application and press the Menu key, you see the
full menu for that application.
MicroSD slot
Your BlackBerry Pearl comes with 64 megabyte of memory, but a
good chunk of that is taken up by applications that came with your
Pearl. If you’re a music or video fan, no need to worry. The folks at
Research in Motion have incorporated a microSD slot in your Pearl
so you can add extended memory and store all the media files you
want in your BlackBerry Pearl.
At the time this book was written, a 2-gigabyte microSD card cost
around $35.
To insert a microSD card, remove the battery cover and then
remove the battery. Open the microSD, insert your microSD card
(see Figure 2-6), and then close the microSD door. Then reinstall
the battery and its cover.

Navigation Guidelines
In the cheat sheet at the front of the book and throughout the
book, we show you application-specific shortcuts. In this section,
however, we go over general navigational guidelines and shortcuts.
Whether you are on a Web page full of text or in an e-mail full of
text, you can perform the tasks in this section.
Following are navigational basics while reading a text-filled page or
a list of items, such as a list of e-mail in the Message application:
 Move to the top of the page: Press the ER key
 Move to the bottom of the page: Press the CV key
 Move to the next page: Press the M or SPACE key
 Move to the previous page: Press the UI key
 Move to the next line: Press the BN key
 Move to the previous line: Press the TY key
Following are some editing basics:
 Select a line: Press and hold the Shift key and use the trackball
to scroll horizontally.
 Select multiple lines: Press and hold the Shift key and use the
trackball to scroll vertically.
 Copy selected text: Press the Alt key and the trackball together.
 Cut selected text: Press the Shift and Del (delete) keys
together.
 Paste text: Press the Shift key and the trackball together.
 Insert an accented letter: Hold down a letter key and horizon-
tally scroll the trackball. As you scroll, that single letter
changes on your screen. When you let go of the letter key, a
list of all accents for that letter appears. You can scroll
through the list to confirm the accented letter of you choice.
 Insert a symbol: Press the SYM key and select the desired
symbol from the popup screen that appears.
 Num lock: Press the Shift and Alt keys together.
 Switch between multitap and SureType: When typing in a text
field, press and hold the * key.

Switching applications
When you are navigating inside an application, you can quickly
change applications. Just press the Menu key and select the Switch
Application option. Another way to switch applications is by press-
ing Alt and Escape, as shown in Figure 2-7.
Figure 2-7: The switch application menu you see when you press Alt + Escape.
Changing options
Throughout the book, you’ll see examples of an option field being
changed to a different value. The easiest way to change the value in
a field is to first scroll to the field using the trackball. Then press
the trackball to see the drop-down list of choices, and finally press
the trackball again on the option of your choice.

R
egardless of how long you’ve had your BlackBerry Pearl —
one day, one week, one month — you’ll want to have it
around for as long as you possibly can. And, for the duration that
you have your Pearl, you’ll want to shine it up and make it look and
sound unique. Your Pearl should reflect your personality and fash-
ion, not someone else’s.
In addition to customizing your BlackBerry Pearl so that it
expresses the inner you, you want to make sure that you keep it in
tip-top shape by watching out for things like battery life and infor-
mation security. Luckily for you, this chapter puts any and all such
worries to rest by filling you in on all you need to know to keep
Pearl shiny and tuned, but yet quirkily personal.
Making Your BlackBerry 
Pearl Yours
The BlackBerry Pearl is the coolest toy on the market right now.
The Pearl unites the sleekness of a cellular phone, the usefulness
of a BlackBerry, and the versatility of a camera. Because of this ter-
rific combination, an increasing number of people are enjoying
their BlackBerry Pearl everyday. We understand your need to 
distinguish your BlackBerry Pearl from others’. Your wish is our

command. Follow the tips and techniques outlined in this section
to give your Pearl a personalized luster.
Branding your BlackBerry Pearl
Like any number of other electronic gadgets that you could possi-
bly own, your BlackBerry Pearl comes to you off the shelf fitted out
with a collection of rather white-bread factory settings. This sec-
tion helps you put your name on your Pearl, both figuratively and
literally. You can start by branding your name on your BlackBerry
Pearl:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Options.
2. Select the Owner setting.
You see spaces for entering your information.
3. In the Name field, enter your name. In the Information
field, enter your contact information.
The idea here is to phrase a message (like the one shown in
Figure 3-1) that would make sense to any possible Good
Samaritan who might find your lost BlackBerry and want to
return it to you.
Figure 3-1: List your owner info here.
If you lock or don’t use your BlackBerry Pearl for a while,
the standby screen comes on, displaying the owner infor-
mation that you entered into the Options (Settings) screen.
Read how to lock your BlackBerry Pearl, either manually or
by using an auto setting, in “Keeping Your BlackBerry Safe,”
later in this chapter.
4. Confirm your changes by pressing the Menu key and
selecting Save.
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Pearl

Choose a language, any language
Branding your BlackBerry Pearl with your own John Hancock is a
good start, but setting the language to your native tongue so you
don’t need to hire a translator to use your Pearl is equally impor-
tant — and equally easy. You can also set your input method of
choice here, which can affect whether AutoText shows up. Don’t
worry. We explain what that means.
Here’s how to change the language setting:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Options.
2. Select the Language setting.
Here you can select the language and input method of your
choice.
3. Select the Language field. In the drop-down list that
appears, select your native tongue.
Depending on your network provider, as well as what
region (North America, Europe, and so on) you’re in, the
language choices you have vary. Most handhelds sold in
North America default to English or English (United States).
If your network provider supports it, you can install more
languages into your BlackBerry Pearl by using Application
Loader in the BlackBerry Pearl Desktop Manager. For
installing more languages onto your BlackBerry Pearl, con-
tact your network service provider.
4. Confirm your changes by pressing the Menu key and
selecting Save.
Isn’t it great when you can actually read what’s on the screen? But
don’t think that you’re finished quite yet. You’ve still got some per-
sonalizing to do.
Typing with ease using AutoText
Your BlackBerry Pearl comes equipped with an AutoText feature,
which is a kind of shorthand that can help you cut down on how
much you have to type. AutoText basically works with a pool of
abbreviations that you set up — you then type an abbreviation to
get the word you associated with that abbreviation. For example, if
you set b/c as an AutoText word for because, anytime you type b/c,
you automatically get because onscreen.
Chapter 3: Turning on Your BlackBerry (and Keeping It Happy) 29

The whole AutoText thing works only if you set up your own per-
sonal code, mapping your abbreviations to their meanings. (This is
why we’re discussing AutoText as part of our personalization dis-
cussion.) To set up your own code, do the following:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Options.
2. Select the AutoText option.
Here, you can choose to either see (or search for) existing
AutoText words or create new ones.
3. Press the Menu key and select New.
The AutoText screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-2.
Figure 3-2: Create AutoText here.
4. In the Replace field, enter the characters that you want to
replace (in this example, b/c). Then, in the With field,
type what replaces your characters (in this example,
because).
5. In the Using field, choose SmartCase or Specified Case.
• SmartCase capitalizes the first letter when the context
calls for that, such as the first word in a sentence.
• Specified Case replaces your AutoText with the exact
text found in the With field.
For example, say you have the AutoText bbg set up for the
term blackberryGoodies.com, and you want it to appear as
is, in terms of letter cases (the first b is not capitalized). If
you were to choose SmartCase for this particular AutoText,
it would be capitalized as the first word in a sentence, which
is not what you want. On the other hand, if you use Specified
Case, your AutoText always appears as blackberryGoodies.
com no matter where it is in the sentence.

6. Confirm your changes by pressing the Menu key and
selecting Save.
Inserting macros
If you frequently give out your BlackBerry Pearl phone number or
your PIN in e-mails, you’ll appreciate macros. Basically, you can
use the AutoText feature to add a customized word for preset
items — things like your Pearl number, PIN, or just the date — so
you don’t have to type them all the time.
Keep in mind that we’re talking about your BlackBerry Pearl PIN
here — your device’s unique identifying number — and not the PIN
someone would use to empty out your checking account with the
help of one of those automated tellers. For more on BlackBerry
PINs, see Chapter 8.
To add a macro for your phone number, for example, first call up
the AutoText screen. (AutoText is one of the options in Options
[Settings].) Type an appropriate word in the Replace field (mynum
would work nicely), scroll to the With field, press the Menu key,
select Insert Macro, and then press the trackball. You’re prompted
with a popup to select from a list of preset items; be sure to scroll
to the Phone Number (%p) option.
After saving your setting, you can test your AutoText by drafting a
simple e-mail.
Getting your dates and 
times lined up
Having the correct date, time, and time zone is important when it
comes to your BlackBerry Pearl for obvious reasons, we hope.
When it comes to having the correct time, the easiest way is to let
BlackBerry Pearl adjust it for you. How? Your Pearl can automati-
cally set its time by using your network provider’s server time.
This way, you need not worry about daylight saving time.
However, even when using your network service provider’s time,
you still need to set up your time zone properly. Follow these steps:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Options.
2. Select the Date/Time setting.
The Date/Time screen appears.
Chapter 3: Turning on Your BlackBerry (and Keeping It Happy) 31

3. Select the Time Zone field. In the drop-down list that
appears, select Change Option.
A drop-down list of time zones appears.
4. Select your time zone.
The Date/Time screen confirms the time zone that you select.
5. Select the Date/Time Source field.
A drop-down list of sources appears, as shown in Figure 3-3.
Figure 3-3: Set the time source of your Pearl to your network provider’s clock.
6. Select Network.
This sets your service provider’s server time as your date
and time source.
7. Confirm your changes by pressing the Menu key and
selecting Save.
Doing so saves your date and time settings in perpetuity —
a really long time, in other words.
Customizing your screen’s 
look and feel
Right up there with making sure that your date and time settings are
accurate is getting the display font, font size, and screen contrast
to your liking. Now we know that some of you don’t give a hoot if
your fonts are Batang or Bookman as long as you can read the text,
but we also know that some of you won’t stop configuring the fonts
until you get them absolutely right. For all you tweakers out there,
here’s how you play around with your BlackBerry Pearl fonts:
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Pearl 
32

1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Options.
2. Select the Screen/Keyboard setting.
The Screen/Keyboard screen appears with various cus-
tomizable fields, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4: The Screen/Keyboard screen, waiting for personalization.
3. Select the Font Family field. In the drop-down list that
appears, select the font you want.
In the drop-down list, you’ll find three to ten fonts, depend-
ing on your provider.
4. Select the Font Size field. In the drop-down list that
appears, select the font size you want.
The smaller the font size, the more you can see onscreen;
however, a smallish font is harder on the eyes.
Note: As you scroll up and down the list of fonts and font
sizes, notice that the text “The quick brown fox jumps over
the lazy dog” takes on the look of the selected font and size
so that you can preview what the particular font looks like
before you confirm your selection.
5. Confirm your changes by pressing the Menu key and
selecting Save.
Tuning Pearl navigation
With fonts out of the way, it’s time to fine-tune the Pearl so that it
navigates the way you want it to. To help you get to the applica-
tions that you need the most, the folks at Research in Motion have
created two convenience keys that bring up applications.
Chapter 3: Turning on Your BlackBerry (and Keeping It Happy) 33

To configure these convenience keys, follow these steps:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Options.
2. Select the Screen/Keyboard setting.
The Screen/Keyboard screen appears with its various cus-
tomizable fields (refer to Figure 3-4).
3. Select the Right Side Convenience Key Opens field. In the
drop-down list that appears, select the application you
want.
For example, instead of the default camera, you can have
your right side convenience key launch your browser.
4. Select the Left Side Convenience Key Opens field. In the
drop-down list that appears, select the application you
want.
You can select what you want your left side key to open
when you press it.
If you often multitask on your BlackBerry Pearl, you can
configure one of your convenience keys to be the
Application Switcher. This way, you can easily switch from,
say, e-mailing to browsing.
5. Select the Trackball Horizontal Sensitivity field. In the
drop-down list that appears, select an option.
This option determines how sensitive you want the track-
ball to be horizontally. You can choose anywhere from 20
to 100 for this option, where 20 is the least sensitive and
100 is the most sensitive.
6. Select the Trackball Vertical Sensitivity field. In the drop-
down list that appears, select an option.
This option is like the preceding one, only it determines the
trackball’s vertical movement. Keep in mind that if your
trackball is too sensitive, it will be hard to control. On the
other hand, if your trackball is not sensitive enough, you
might find it slow.
Think of trackball sensitivity settings as the mouse sensitiv-
ity on the PC. The right sensitivity can be helpful for
making the trackball go exactly where you want it. Play
around with vertical and horizontal sensitivities and adjust
them to your liking.
7. Confirm your changes by pressing the Menu key and
selecting Save.

Choosing themes for 
your BlackBerry
Your BlackBerry Pearl is preloaded with different themes depend-
ing on your provider (see Figure 3-5). To change your theme, follow
these steps:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Options.
2. Select the Theme setting.
You see a list of available Themes.
3. Select the Theme you want.
You see a preview of the theme you’ve selected.
4. Select Activate from the contextual menu that appears.
You should see the change immediately.
Figure 3-5: Two different themes on a BlackBerry Pearl.
You can always download other themes here — just remember that
you have to use your BlackBerry, not your PC, to access these URLs:
 http://mobile.blackberry.com
 www.blackberrygoodies.com/bb/themes
Unlike the figure on the left in Figure 3-5, your BlackBerry Pearl, out
of the box, probably doesn’t come with a theme that lists all appli-
cations on the Home screen. To see the list of applications installed
on your BlackBerry Pearl, you need to press the Menu key to see
the Application List, as shown in Figure 3-6. We know what you are
thinking: What if you don’t like the order in which applications are
listed in the Application List? Don’t worry, you can change that
order — and hide the applications you don’t often use.
Chapter 3: Turning on Your BlackBerry (and Keeping It Happy) 35

Figure 3-6: Popup showing a list of applications.
To change the order of the applications in the Application List:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key.
This brings up a popup showing a list of applications.
2. If you have the T-Mobile Zen Theme, select the Organize
Applications option.
3. Scroll to the desired application, press the Menu key, and
select Move Application.
Doing this allows you to scroll the desired application up
and down throughout the list, as shown in Figure 3-7.
Figure 3-7: A Browser application is being moved.
4. Move the trackball up and down to place the application
into the desired order, and then press the trackball.
This completes the ordering of the application that you
selected in Step 3.
To hide an application, select Hide Application instead of Move
Application in Step 3. A grayed icon means it is currently hidden.

The first five applications listed in the Application List screen are
the ones accessible from your Home screen. So choose your top
five listed applications based on what you do the most on your
BlackBerry Pearl.
Wallpaper for your BlackBerry
Like your desktop PC, you can customize your BlackBerry to have
personalized wallpaper for your Home screen. You can set an
image to be your BlackBerry Home screen background by using
the BlackBerry Media application, as follows:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Media.
The Media application opens, and you see several cate-
gories: Music, Video, Ringtones, and Pictures.
2. Select the Picture category.
Doing so brings up two folders named Preloaded Media and
Device Memory. The Preloaded Media folder stores pictures
that came with your BlackBerry Pearl, and the Device Memo-
ry folder stores pictures that you took with your camera.
3. Select the Preloaded Media folder.
You see all the pictures in the folder. If you’ve taken pic-
tures with the BlackBerry Pearl camera (see Chapter 11),
you might want to use the Device Memory folder instead.
4. Select the picture you want to use for your home screen
background
The selected picture appears in full-screen view.
5. Press the Menu key and select Set as Home Screen Image.
The picture is set as your new Home screen wallpaper.
6. Press and hold the Escape key to return to the Home
screen to see the result.
The Escape key is located on the right side of the trackball. For
more on the BlackBerry Pearl’s body features, see Chapter 2.

Remember that you need to use your BlackBerry, not your PC, to
access these URLs.
After you have your BlackBerry’s look and feel just the way you
want, there’s just one thing left to do before you can move on: 
getting your BlackBerry to sound the way you want it to.
Let freedom ring
The whole appeal of the BlackBerry phenomenon is the idea that
this little electronic device can make your life easier. One of the
ways it accomplishes this is by acting as your personal reminder
service — letting you know when an appointment is coming up, a
phone call is coming in, an e-mail has arrived, and so on. Basically,
your BlackBerry is set to bark at you if it feels there’s something it
knows that you should know. Figure 3-8 lists the kinds of things
your BlackBerry considers bark-worthy, ranging from browser
alerts to tasks deadlines.
Figure 3-8: Set attention-needy applications here.
People react differently to different sounds. Some BlackBerry barks
would be greatly appreciated by certain segments of the population,
whereas other segments might react to the same sound by pitching
their BlackBerry under the nearest bus. The folks at Research in
Motion are well aware of this fact and have devised a great way for
you to customize how you want your BlackBerry to bark at you —
they call it your profile.
You can jump right into things by using a predefined profile, or you
can create your own profile. The upcoming sections look at both
approaches.
Whether you create your own profile or customize a predefined
profile, each profile is divided into different categories. Each cate-
gory is really just the application for which you want to define an
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Pearl 
38

alert. The following is a sample list of applications that you can
define within each profile:
 Browser: Alerts you when you receive a new channel push,
which is just a Web page sent to your BlackBerry.
 Calendar: Alerts you when you have upcoming appointments.
 Level1 Messages (urgent e-mail messages): Alerts you with a
special tone when you have an urgent e-mail. What’s consid-
ered an urgent message? E-mail can be defined as urgent by
your sender. Also, a BlackBerry PIN-to-PIN message can be
considered urgent. For more on PIN-to-PIN, see Chapter 8.
 Messages: Alerts you when there is a new e-mail message in
your inbox.
 Phone: Alerts you if there is an incoming call or a new 
voice mail.
 SMS: Alerts you when you have an SMS message.
 Tasks: Alerts you of an upcoming to-do deadline.
You might have more categories than what we’ve listed here. For
example, if your Pearl came with the Instant Messaging program,
you might have New IM — AIM and New IM — Yahoo! on your list.
Regardless how many categories you have, configure them the
same way as described in this section.
You can personalize all the listed applications depending on how
you want to be alerted. Because the way you customize them is
similar, we use the Message application as an example in the text
that follows, as we customize a predefined profile that comes with
your BlackBerry.
After this, we go over creating a new profile from scratch. You
might be wondering: Why do I need to create a new profile if I can
personalize the predefined profiles? Well, if you want to keep the
predefined settings the way they are and heavily personalize your
profile, creating a new profile is the way to go.
Using factory settings
If you’re okay with customizing a predefined, factory-loaded pro-
file, do the following:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Profile.
A screen listing all the profiles appears, as shown in 
Figure 3-9.
Chapter 3: Turning on Your BlackBerry (and Keeping It Happy) 39

2. Select Advanced.
Figure 3-9: List of profiles for you to choose from.
3. Scroll to the Normal profile in the list, press the Menu
key, and select Edit.
The Normal screen appears, listing the different applica-
tions with alert capabilities (refer to Figure 3-8).
4. In the Normal screen, select the Messages application.
Then select the Edit option.
You’re faced with the Messages configure screen, which is
divided into an Out of Holster section and an In Holster
section, as shown in Figure 3-10. A holster (in this context)
is simply the belt-clip or case that houses your BlackBerry
while you’re not using it. BlackBerry is smart enough to
know when it’s in a holster.
Figure 3-10: Choose a tone to alert you when your BlackBerry is out of its holster.
5. Select the Out of Holster field, and then select the
Change Option.
You’re prompted with a drop-down list, spelling out your
alert options.
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Pearl 
40

6. Select Tone.
Doing so enables sound in the Out of Holster mode.
7. Continuing in the Message configure screen, select the
Tune field. Then select Change Option.
You’re prompted with a set of tunes in a drop-down list.
Note: You’re not going to find “Stairway to Heaven” here,
but you should be able to find something you like. If you
can’t find one you like, you can always download ringtones;
see Chapter 12 for more information.
8. Select the tune you’d like.
As you scroll through the tunes and pause, BlackBerry
plays the tune so you know what it sounds like before you
change it.
9. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackball and
selecting Save.
As you might have guessed from how the Messages in Default
screen is divided, your BlackBerry can notify you in different ways
based on whether your BlackBerry is in plain view (Out of Holster)
or tucked away next to your belt (In Holster). To set up a different
sound for In Holster mode, just put the necessary info in the fields
for the In Holster section — and be sure to choose a different tune
this time. (Choosing the same tune kind of defeats the purpose,
doesn’t it?)
As we mentioned, you can do the same to personalize other appli-
cations listed in each profile.
If you’re like us and you get more than 200 e-mails a day, you prob-
ably don’t want your BlackBerry sounding off each time an e-mail
arrives. What you can do is set up your BlackBerry so that it noti-
fies you only if an e-mail has been marked as urgent, requiring your
immediate attention. Set the notification for your Messages appli-
cation to None for both In Holster and Out of Holster. Then, in the
Level1 Messages option, set your desired notification for both In
Holster and Out of Holster. That way, you have conveniently fil-
tered any unnecessary e-mail notifications, leaving just the urgent
stuff to sound off to you.
Creating your own profile
You need to know which applications on your BlackBerry have
alert capabilities because you can then personalize each “Hey,
you!” to your liking. You can have your BlackBerry so personalized
that you can tell whether you have a phone call or an incoming
message just by how your BlackBerry sounds.
Chapter 3: Turning on Your BlackBerry (and Keeping It Happy) 41

If you’re already familiar with the different applications and are
clear how you want each one to alert you, go on and create your
own profile. As we mentioned, you can achieve the same result by
personalizing the predefined profiles that come with your
BlackBerry. But if you are one of those who likes to keep the prede-
fined profiles the way they are, go ahead and create a new profile.
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
profile.
A popup screen listing all the profiles appears (refer to
Figure 3-9).
2. Select Advanced.
3. Press the Menu key and select New Profile (see 
Figure 3-11).
A new Profiles screen appears, prompting you to name
your profile.
Figure 3-11: Creating your own profile.
4. In the Name field, enter a name for your profile.
For this example, just type My Profile.
5. Configure your new profile.
Refer to Steps 3 through 7 of the preceding “Using factory
settings” section to customize each one of the seven 
applications.
6. Press the trackball and select Save.
Your newly created Profile appears listed in the Profiles
screen.
7. In the Profiles screen, select My Profile and press the
trackball.
This activates your newly created profile and returns you
to the Home screen.
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry Pearl 
42

Regardless whether the ringtone is for an incoming call or an
incoming e-mail, you can download more ringtones to personalize
your BlackBerry.
You can download free ringtones at mobile.blackberry.com. Just
be sure to call up this URL with your BlackBerry, not your PC.
To switch between the current profile and a vibrating profile: From
the Home screen, press and hold the # key.
Creating an exception
What is an exception? An exception assigns a specific ringtone to 
a particular person’s phone number(s) in the Address Book. For
example, say your current ringtone for any phone call is the default
ringtone, but you want calls from your significant other to be some
romantic song. One way to do this is to create an exception. Another
way is to have a custom ringtone set for a contact in your Address
Book; refer to Chapter 4 for details on that method.
To create a new exception, choose New Exception instead of New
profile in Step 3 of the preceding section. You’ll see a screen similar
to Figure 3-12. Choose the From field from your Address Book.
Please note that exceptions apply only to phone calls.
Figure 3-12: Creating an exception for the Quiet profile.
Power Usage and Consumption
Your BlackBerry Pearl comes equipped with a rechargeable,
replaceable lithium battery that can have stand-by time (time when
your BlackBerry is on but not being used) that lasts around 10 to
15 days. The more you use the backlight (the light that lets you see
your display screen better), the more quickly your battery is going
to run out. Finally, keep in mind that your BlackBerry Pearl is an
Chapter 3: Turning on Your BlackBerry (and Keeping It Happy) 43

Internet-ready device (okay, okay, we know you know that, because
that’s why you got it, right?) and that anything you do with a net-
work signal (sending and receiving e-mails, Internet browsing, talk-
ing on the phone) eats into your battery reserves in a big way.
Here is a handy list of battery conservation tips to keep your
BlackBerry up and running as long as possible while you’re on 
the go:
 Reduce backlight amount and timeout. Using the Screen/
Keyboard option, adjust your backlight to a low setting. In
addition, set the backlight timeout as low as possible. (You
can get the details on setting Screen/Keyboard option in the
“Customizing your screen’s look and feel” section, earlier in
this chapter.)
 Don’t use what you don’t need. Turn off any wireless capabil-
ities if you’re in an area where you’re out of coverage (for
example, underground or on an airplane) so that your Pearl
doesn’t waste its battery searching for radio signals. (For all
the details on dealing with wireless features, see Part III.)
Since your Pearl has Bluetooth capability, turn it off during
those times when you have no use for it.
 Bulk up your power. If you are a heavy phone user or are on
the go all the time, consider purchasing an extra extended
battery or a car power kit. See Chapter 16, where we suggest
where to purchase one.
Keeping Your BlackBerry Safe
The folks at Research in Motion take security seriously, and so
should you. Always set up a password on your BlackBerry Pearl. If
your Pearl hasn’t prompted you to set up a password, you should
immediately do so. Here’s how:
1. Press the Menu key and select Security Options.
2. Select General Settings.
The Security screen appears.
3. Select the Password field and, in the drop-down list that
appears, select Enabled.
All this does for now is enable the Password feature. You
won’t be prompted to type a password until you save the
changes you just made.

At this time, you should be prompted for a password.
5. Type a password and then type it again for verification.
From this point on, whenever you lock your BlackBerry
Pearl and want to use it again, you have to type the same
password. How to lock your BlackBerry? Good question,
keep reading.
Make sure to remember what your password is and not just which
key you press. You need the same password if you link your
BlackBerry Pearl with the BlackBerry Desktop Manager for syn-
chronization. For more on BlackBerry Desktop Manager, please
refer to Chapter 13.
Setting up your password is a good first step, but just having a
password won’t help you much if you don’t take the further step of
locking your BlackBerry when you’re not using it. (You don’t want
people at the office or sitting at the next table at the coffee shop
checking out your e-mails or phone history when you take a bath-
room break, do you?) So, how do you lock your BlackBerry? Let us
count the ways. We came up with two, in fact.
You can go the Autolock After Timeout (also known as Security
Timeout) route:
1. Press the Menu key and select Options.
2. Select the Security option.
3. Select General Settings.
The Security screen appears.
4. Select the Security Timeout field and, in the drop-down
list that appears, select the desired time.
The preset times range from 1 minute to 1 hour.
5. Confirm your changes by pressing the Menu key and
selecting Save.
To lock your Pearl on demand, simply press and hold the asterisk
(*) key when you’re on the Home screen. You probably would lock
your Pearl if you want to prevent others from accessing your data
or before you put your Pearl into your pocket.
No matter what route you take to lock your Blackberry Pearl, you
use your (newly created) password to unlock it when you get back
from wherever you’ve been.

Who Ya Gonna Call (When Your
BlackBerry Pearl Breaks)?
Certainly not those Ghostbusters guys. We do suggest that you
contact your network service provider first. (Remember them?
They’re the guys who sold you the device in the first place.)
You can’t buy direct from RIM! Is that true? Before you start calling
anyone, you should know that your BlackBerry Pearl, holster, and
cradle (if it came with one) are under a one-year warranty from
either RIM itself or your service provider. Within the first year, RIM
or your service provider will replace or repair your BlackBerry if
any defect is found. Do keep in mind, though, that your warranty
does not cover any damage to your Pearl caused by an accident or
misuse.
With that out of the way, if your BlackBerry Pearl is still under the
one-year warranty and it somehow isn’t functioning properly, give
your service provider a ring. (Table 3-1 lists the customer service
numbers of the major U.S. and Canadian service providers.)
Table 3-1
Toll-Free Numbers for Major Service Providers

Telus (Canada)
1-866-558-2273
If your Pearl is out of warranty, you can have it repaired or
replaced for a fee. The best bet is still to contact your network
service provider to find out how much it would cost to repair it,
and to find out whether you have other options.

Getting Organized
with Your Pearl

In this part . . .
T
his part covers how to use your BlackBerry to its
fullest to get you –– and keep you –– organized. 
Peruse the chapters here to ﬁnd out how to use your
Address Book, keep appointments, make notes, and 
keep your passwords safe.

Chapter 4
Remembering and Locating
Your Acquaintances
In This Chapter
 Exploring the BlackBerry Address Book
 Adding, viewing, editing, and deleting contacts
 Finding a contact in the Address Book
 Organizing your Address Book
 Using Maps for direction
T
he idea of an address book was around long before the
BlackBerry was conceived. Address Book on the BlackBerry
serves the same function as any address book: an organizational tool
that gives you a place to record information about people. This tool
gives you a central place from which you can retrieve information so
that you can reach your contacts through many ways: phone, cell-
phone, e-mail, and snail mail. In today’s environment, an address
book is an essential tool, and your BlackBerry is there at the ready.
In this chapter, we show you how to make your BlackBerry a
handy, timesaving tool for managing your contacts’ information.
Specifically, you find out how to add, change, and delete contacts
as well as how to locate them later. You’ll also be amazed at how
well the Address Book is integrated with all the other BlackBerry
features you’ve come to know and love — phoning contacts,
adding invites to your meetings, adding contacts to BlackBerry
Messenger, and composing e-mails.
Accessing Your Address Book
The good people at Research in Motion make it easy for you to find
the Address Book. Start by taking a look at the BlackBerry Home
screen. The Address Book icon looks like a little black book.

Opening the Address Book couldn’t be simpler: Use the trackball
to highlight its icon and then press the trackball or press Enter.
Any application menu is always accessible through the Menu key.
Working with Address Book Names
You have a new BlackBerry. The first thing you’ll want to do is try
to call or e-mail someone, right? But wait a sec — you don’t have
any contact information yet, which means you’re going to have to
type in someone’s e-mail address each time you send an e-mail — 
a hassle if there ever were one.
Time to get with the plan. Most of us humans — social creatures
that we are — maintain a list of contacts somewhere, whether in an
old cellphone, or maybe on a piece of paper tucked away in a
wallet. We’re pretty sure you have some kind of list somewhere.
The trick is getting that list into your BlackBerry device so that
you can access the info more efficiently. The good news for you is
that the “getting contact info into your BlackBerry device” trick
isn’t a hard one to master. Stick with us, and you’ll have it down
pat by the end of this chapter.
Often the simplest way to get contact information into your
BlackBerry is to enter it manually. However, if you’ve invested a lot
of time and energy in maintaining some type of address book appli-
cation on your desktop computer, you might want to hot sync that
data into your BlackBerry. Chapter 13 provides details on how to
synchronize some of your desktop application data — address
book, e-mail, appointments, and memos stuff.
Creating a new contact
Have you tried chanting someone’s phone number because you
can’t scare up a writing implement? Not if you have your handy
BlackBerry device with you. With BlackBerry in hand, follow these
steps to create a new contact:
1. From the Address Book screen, press the Menu key and
select New Address.
The New Address screen appears, as shown in Figure 4-1
(left).
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Pearl 
50

Figure 4-1: Create a new contact (left). Address Book after adding Jane Doe
(right).
2. Scroll through the various fields, stopping and entering
the contact information you feel is appropriate.
You’ll use your BlackBerry keyboard to enter this 
information.
3. When you finish entering the contact information you
want, press the Menu key and select Save.
At this point, you should see your Jane Doe added to the
list, as shown in Figure 4-1 (right).
A word from the seers
We don’t think you can overdo it when entering a person’s contact
information. You should strive to enter complete information or as
much as you possibly can. Maybe the benefit won’t be obvious
now, but in the future when your memory fails or your boss needs
a critical piece of info that you just so happen to have at the ready,
you’ll thank us for this advice.
To create another new blank e-mail field for the same contact,
press the Menu key and select Add Email Address. You can have
up to three e-mail addresses per contact.
When entering an e-mail address, press the SPACE key to insert an
@ symbol or a period (.).
If a contact has an extension for his or her phone number, no prob-
lem. When calling such a contact from your BlackBerry, you can
instruct BlackBerry to dial the extension after the initial phone
number. When entering the phone number into the New Address 
or Enter Address screen, type the primary phone number, press
Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances 51

the Menu key, select Add Wait or Add Pause from the menu that
appears, and then add the extension number. Wait lets your
BlackBerry know that it’s time to call up the Extension Dialog
screen, which prompts you to enter the extension number. Pause
tells your BlackBerry to dial the extension number for you — after
a two-second delay — whenever you want it to.
Adding your own fields
Perhaps your contact information really doesn’t fit into any of the
available fields. Although you can’t really create any additional
fields from scratch, you can commandeer one of the User fields for
your own purposes.
The User fields are located at the bottom of the screen — you have
to scroll down to see them. Basically, the User fields are fair game —
you can use these fields any way you want (which is great), and you
can even change the field’s name. (Face it, User field is not that
helpful as a descriptive title.) For example, you could rename User
fields to capture suffixes (such as MD, PhD, and so on). Or how
about profession, birth date, hobbies, school, or nickname? When
it comes down to it, you decide what information is important to
you. Just remember that changing a User field name applies to the
entire Address Book and not just one contact.
To rename a User field:
1. Scroll to the bottom of the screen to navigate to one of
the User fields.
2. Press the Menu key and select Change Field Name.
Note: The Change Field Name selection appears only if the
cursor is in a User field.
3. Use the keyboard to enter the new User field name.
4. To save your changes, press the trackball or Enter key.
You’re all set.
Adding contacts from other
BlackBerry applications
When you receive an e-mail message or get a call from someone,
you’ve got yourself some contact information in Messages or
Phone. (RIM makes this easy for you because Messages and Phone
can recognize phone numbers or e-mail addresses and then 
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Pearl 
52

highlight that information for a quick cut and paste.) Maybe that
info isn’t complete, but you definitely have at least an e-mail
address or a phone number to start with. Now, if you’re pretty sure
you’ll be corresponding with this person, it’s just logical that you’d
want to add that information to your BlackBerry Address Book.
When you have an e-mail or a phone log open, just scroll to an
e-mail address or phone number and press the Menu key while
that piece of information is highlighted. An Add to Address Book
option pops up on the menu. Select Add to Address Book, and a
New Address screen appears, prefilled with that particular piece of
information. All you need to do now is enter the rest of the infor-
mation you know about the person, ready to be saved into the
Address Book — just one more sign of BlackBerry’s ongoing
attempt to make your life easier.
Viewing a contact
Okay, you just entered your friend’s name, Jane, into your
BlackBerry, but you have this nagging thought in the back of your
mind that you typed the wrong phone number. You want to quickly
view Jane’s information. Just highlight Jane’s name from the
Address Book list screen and press the trackball. Pressing the
trackball while a name is highlighted is the same as opening the
menu and selecting View — just quicker.
View mode displays only information that’s been filled in. (It doesn’t
bother showing fields in which you haven’t entered anything.)
Editing a contact
Change is an inevitable part of life. Given that fact, your contact
information is sure to change as well. If you want to keep the infor-
mation you diligently put in your Address Book current, you’ll have
to do some updating now and then.
To update a contact, follow these steps:
1. From the Address Book list screen, highlight the contact
name you want to edit, press the Menu key, and select Edit.
The Edit Address screen for the contact name you selected
makes an appearance.
2. Scroll through the various fields of the Edit Address
screen, editing the contact information as you see fit.
Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances 53

If you want to replace only a few words or letters located 
in the middle of a field (rather than replacing the whole
text), hold down the Alt key while scrolling the trackball 
to position your cursor precisely on the text you want to
change. Then make your desired changes.
3. Press the Menu key and select Save.
The edit you made for this contact is saved.
When you’re editing information and you want to totally replace
the entry with a new one, it is much faster to first clear the con-
tents, especially if the old data is long. When you are in an editable
field (as opposed to a selectable field), just press the Menu key and
then select the Clear Field option. This feature is available in all
text-entry fields and for most BlackBerry applications.
Deleting a contact
When it’s time to eradicate somebody’s contact information
(whether a case of duplication, or a bit of bad blood — yes, we
admit to having occasionally stricken someone from our Address
Books in a fit of pique), the BlackBerry OS makes it easy. Just high-
light the contact name you want to delete from the Address Book
list screen and press the DEL key. When you’re ready to part with
this record, click Delete from the confirmation screen. That’s it.
The contact is deleted and disappears from your contact list.
Sometimes dealing with the Confirmation screen can be a pain if you
want to delete several contacts in a row. If you are 100 percent sure
that you want to ditch a number of contacts, you can suspend the
Confirmation feature by setting the Confirm Delete option to No in
the Address Book Options screen. Check the “Setting preferences”
section later in this chapter for more on Address Book options.
Looking for Someone?
Somehow — usually through a combination of typing skills and the
shuttling of data between various electronic devices — you’ve cre-
ated a nice long list of contacts in your Address Book. Nice enough,
we suppose, but useless unless you can find the phone number of
Rufus T. Firefly at the drop of a hat.
That’s where the Find screen comes in. In fact, the first thing that
you see in the Address Book when you open it is the Find screen,
as shown in the left screen of Figure 4-2.
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Pearl 
54

Figure 4-2: Your search starts here (left). Enter letters to shorten the potential
contact list search (right).
You can conveniently search through your contacts by following
these steps:
1. In the Find field, enter the starting letters of the name
you want to search for.
Your search criterion is the name of the person. You could
enter the last name or first name or both.
The list is usually sorted by first name and then last name.
As you type the letters, notice that the list starts shrinking
based on the matches on the letters you enter. The right
screen in Figure 4-2 illustrates how this works.
2. Highlight the name from the list of matches.
If you have multiple matches, use the trackball to scroll
through the list to find the person’s name.
3. Press the Menu key and select from the possible actions
listed on the menu that appears.
After you find the person you want, you can select from
these options, some of which are shown in Figure 4-3:
• Email: Starts a new e-mail message. See Chapter 7 for
more information about e-mail.
• PIN: Starts a new PIN-to-PIN message, which is a mes-
saging system unique to BlackBerry. With PIN-to-PIN,
you can send someone who has a BlackBerry a quick
message. See Chapter 8 for more details about 
PIN-to-PIN messaging.
• Call: Uses the phone to dial the number.
• SMS: Starts a new SMS message. SMS is short for Short
Messaging Service, which is used in cellphones. See
Chapter 8 for more details about SMS.
Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances 55

• Send to Messenger Contact: Send this Address entry to
one of your BlackBerry Messenger contacts.
• MMS: Short for Multimedia Messaging Service, an evo-
lution of SMS that allows you to send multimedia mes-
sages, such as audio and video clips. See Chapter 8
for more details on MMS.
Figure 4-3: You get options for the selected contact.
If you have a finger-fumble and press a letter key in error, press the
Escape key once to return to the original list (the one showing all
your contacts), or press the Menu key once and select View All.
If you think you’re hallucinating when you notice that sometimes
the menu item Email <contact name> or Call <contact name>
displays on the menu and sometimes not, relax. There’s nothing
wrong with your eyesight or your mind. Address Book is smart
enough to know when it’s appropriate to show those menu options.
If a contact has a phone number, Call <contact name> and SMS
<contact name> show up, and the same is true for e-mail and per-
sonal identification number (PIN). In fact, this list of actions is a
convenient way to find out if you have particular information — a
phone number or an e-mail address — for a contact.
If you have a long list in your Address Book and you want to scroll
down a page at a time, just hold down the Alt key and scroll. You’ll
get where you need to go a lot faster.
Organizing Your Contacts
You’ve been diligent by adding your contacts to your Address Book,
and your list has been growing at a pretty good clip. It now has all
the contact information for your business colleagues, clients, and
(of course) family, friends, and relatives. In fact, your Address Book
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Pearl 
56

has grown so much that it now holds hundreds of contacts, and you
start to notice that it now takes you more time to find somebody.
You know this isn’t rocket science. You’re going to want to do one
of the following:
 Organize your contacts into groups. Using groups (as every
kindergarten teacher could tell you) is a way to arrange some-
thing (in your case, contacts) to make them more manageable.
How you arrange your groups is really up to you because the
organizing principle should be based on whatever makes sense
(to you, at least) and fits the group you set up. For example,
you can place all your customer contacts in a Clients group
and family members and relatives in a Family group. Then,
instead of searching for names of individuals in one humon-
gous list, you can search in a smaller, more manageable group.
 Set up your contacts so that you can use some kind of filter
on them. Another way to organize and streamline how your
BlackBerry Address Book lists your contacts is to use the
Filter feature in combination with BlackBerry’s Categories.
(Categories is just another way BlackBerry Address Book
helps you filter your contacts.) Using the Filter feature nar-
rows the Address Book list to such an extent that you have to
use only trackball to scroll down and find your contact — no
need to type search keywords.
Whether you use the Group or Filter feature is up to you. You’ll find
out how to use both methods in the next sections.
Creating a group
A BlackBerry group in Address Book — as opposed to any other
kind of group you can imagine — is just a simple filter or category.
In other words, a group arranges your contacts into subsets with-
out affecting the content of your contact entries. In the Address
Book itself, a group shows up in the contact list just like any other
contact. The only wrinkle here is that when you select the group,
the contacts associated with that group — and only the contacts
associated with that group — appear onscreen.
Need some help visualizing how this works? Go ahead and create a
new group, following these steps:
1. From the Address Book screen, press the Menu key and
select New Group.
A screen appears, allowing you to enter a group name.
Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances 57

2. In the New Group field, enter the name of the group.
You could name the group anything, but for the sake of this
example, go ahead and name the group Friends.
After entering the name of the group, you’re ready to save
it. But hold on a sec — you can’t save this group until you
associate a member to it. To satisfy such a hard-and-fast
rule, proceed to the next step to add a member.
3. Press the Menu key and select Add Member.
The main Address Book list shows up in all its glory, ready
to be pilfered for names to add to your new Group list.
4. Highlight the name of a contact you want to add to your
new Group list. Then press the trackball and make a
selection from the menu that appears.
You can select from these options:
• Email: Adds the contact’s e-mail address to the group.
• PIN: Adds the contact’s PIN to the group.
• Phone: Adds the contact’s phone number to the group.
Everybody knows a Rob Kao, so go ahead and select him.
You’ll notice that doing so places Rob Kao in your Friends
group list, as shown in Figure 4-4. (Rob Kao, a co-author of
the book you’re holding in your hands, is a very popular
fellow.)
Figure 4-4: Your new group has one member.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to add more friends to your list.
After you’re satisfied, save your group.
6. Press the Menu key and select Save Group.
Your Friends group is duly saved, and you can now see
Friends listed on your main Address Book list.

Using the Filter feature 
on your contacts
Are you a left-brainer or a right-brainer? Yankees fan or Red Sox
fan? An innie or an outie? Dividing up the world into categories is
something everybody does (no divisions there), so it should come
as no surprise that BlackBerry divides your contacts into distinct
categories as well.
By default, two categories are already set for you on your BlackBerry:
the Business category and the Personal category. But why stop at
two? BlackBerry makes it easy to create more categories. In this
section, you first find out how to categorize a contact, and then
you see how to filter your Address Book list. Finally, you find out
how to create new categories.
Categorize your contacts
Whether you’re creating a contact or editing an existing contact, 
as long as you’re in Edit mode, you can categorize that particular
contact.
You can use these steps to add categories:
1. From the Address Book, select a contact, press the Menu
key, and then select Edit.
2. Press the Menu key and select Categories.
A Categories list appears. By default, you see only the
Business and the Personal categories.
3. Highlight Personal and press the SPACE key.
4. Press the Menu key and select Save.
You are brought back to the Edit screen for this particular
contact.
5. To complete your changes, press the Menu key and select
Save (again).
You now have one — count ’em, one — contact with Personal as its
category, which means you can now filter your Address Book list
using a category. Here’s how:
1. From the Address Book screen, press the Menu key and
select Filter.
Your Categories list makes an appearance.
Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances 59

2. Use the SPACE key or press the trackball to select the
Personal check box.
Your Address Book list immediately shrinks to just the con-
tacts assigned to the Personal category.
As you add more contacts to a category, you can also use Find and
enter the first few letters of the name to search and further narrow
the search for a contact. If you need a refresher on how this Find
works, see the “Looking for Someone?” section, earlier in this 
chapter.
Adding a new category
Whoever thought the default categories (Business and Personal)
were enough for the complexities of the real world probably didn’t
have many acquaintances, but that’s neither here nor there. It’s
easy to add categories, so you can divide your world as much as
you like. Just do the following:
1. From the Address Book list screen, press the Menu key
and select Filter.
2. Press the Menu key and select New.
A pop-up screen appears, asking you to name the new cate-
gory you want to create.
3. In the Name field, enter a name for your category and
then press the trackball.
Your new category is saved. Now the Filter screen, which
lists all the categories, includes the new one.
Applying a category filter
Having diligently assigned categories on your contacts, you can
easily filter the Address Book list based on these categories. To do
so, follow these steps:
1. From the Address Book list screen, press the Menu key
and select Filter.
The Categories screen appears.
2. Highlight a Category and press the SPACE key.
Your Address Book list screen now shows the filtered con-
tacts with the name of the Category as a header of the list.
You can remove the filter by repeating the process. When you get
to the Categories screen, the Category you previously selected is
marked by a check. By highlighting this Category and pressing the
SPACE key, you’re removing it as a filter.

Setting preferences
Sure there are some things you may want to behave differently in
Address Book. The folks at RIM have anticipated some and made
them available to you through Address Book Options, a palette of
tricks you can use to navigate some out-of-the-ordinary situations.
Here’s the rundown:
 Sort By: Allows you to change the way the list is sorted. You
can change the sort field criteria to First Name, Last Name, or
Company. Use the SPACE key to toggle among the choices.
 Confirm Delete: Allows you to display a Confirmation screen
for all contact deletions. You should always keep this feature
turned on for normal usage. You could accidentally delete
someone from your Address Book in many ways, so this fea-
ture is a good way of minimizing those accidents.
 Allow Duplicate Names: Self-explanatory. If you turn this on,
you can have multiple people who happen to share the same
name in your Address Book. If it’s off, you get a warning when
you try to add a name that’s identical to someone who is
already on your list. Maybe you are tired and are mistakenly
trying to add the same person twice. Then again, sometimes
people just have the same name. We recommend keeping the
default value of Yes, allowing you to have contacts with the
same names.
How do you change any of these options? The fields behave like
any other fields in a BlackBerry application. You simply highlight
the field, press the Menu key, and select Change Option from the
Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances 61
You can quote me on this one
The purpose of groups is to easily scroll through your contacts, right? Assuming
that you have a long list, your Family group could be buried in the middle of it —
given where F falls in the alphabet. Or, you might not even remember one of the
group names you used. (How embarrassing.) One simple technique to make a group
appear at the very top of your contact list is to enclose it within single quotes. For
example, instead of naming your group Friends, you could name it ‘Friends.’ The
single quote serves a double purpose:
 As a visual aid to quickly tell you that the contact listing is a group
 As a way to force groups to always list at the very top
Just make sure that none of your contact names are enclosed in single quotes.

menu that appears. You then see a menu screen that allows you to
select the possible option values
Locating a Contact Using Maps
No, we don’t mean finding someone in your Address Book. We liter-
ally mean finding where he or she is in the neighborhood. Your
BlackBerry has a built-in Maps application. If you’ve used Google
Maps on the Internet, you should be familiar with how this works.
You can access the Maps application by launching it using the
Menu key from the Home screen. But what’s neat is that it’s seam-
lessly integrated with the Address Book. So if you have a contact
and you put in a real address, you can highlight that contact from
the Address Book screen and press the Menu key. You should see
the menu item View Work Map or View Home Map or both, depend-
ing on which address is available, work or home. Selecting the
option displays a map pointing to that specific address. Now, what
you do with this map is up to you. You can use the trackball to
position the map. Panning and zooming features are available
through the Menu key.
One useful feature of the map is to get directions from location to
location. While you’re in the map, press the Menu key and select
Directions. A screen appears, allowing you to enter from and to
addresses. (If you open this map from Address Book, a list of ad-
dresses for the current contact are listed on this screen, so you
can conveniently select from these addresses instead of entering
one.) After entering from and to addresses, a screen appears, 
displaying a map and a listing of street-by-street turn directions.
Try it.

T
o some folks, the key to being organized and productive is mas-
tering time management and using their time wisely (and we’re
not just talking about reading this book while you’re commuting to
work). Many have discovered that there is no better way to organ-
ize one’s time than to use a calendar — a daily planner tool. Some
prefer digital to paper, so they use a planner software program on
their PC — either installed on their hard drive or accessed through
an Internet portal (such as Yahoo!). The smartest of the bunch, of
course, use their BlackBerry Pearl handheld because it has the whole
planner thing covered in handy form with its Calendar application.
In this chapter, we show you how to keep your life (personal 
and work) in order by managing your appointments with your
BlackBerry Pearl Calendar. What’s great about managing your time
on a BlackBerry Pearl versus your PC is that your Pearl is always
there with you to remind you. Just remember that you won’t have
excuses any more for forgetting that important quarterly meeting
or Bertha’s birthday bash.

Accessing the BlackBerry 
Pearl Calendar
The BlackBerry Pearl Calendar is one of the Pearl core applications,
like Address Book or Phone (read more about the others in Chapter
1), so it’s quite easy to get to. If you have the default BlackBerry
Pearl theme named Zen, you can see the Calendar icon on the Home
screen as one of the five applications on the bottom of your screen.
To get cracking with your Calendar, from the Home screen, press
the Menu key and select Calendar. Voilà! — you have Calendar.
Choosing Your Calendar View
The first time you open Calendar, you’ll likely see the Day view,
which is a default setting on the Pearl, as shown in Figure 5-1. You
can change the Calendar view, however, to a different one that
works better for your needs:
 Day: This view gives you a summary of your appointments 
for the day. By default, it lists all your appointments from 
9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Week: This view shows you a seven-day summary view of
your appointments. By using this view, you can see how busy
you are for the week.
Figure 5-1: Day view in Calendar.
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Pearl 
64

 Month: The Month view shows you every day of the month.
You can’t tell how many appointments are in a day, but you
can see on which days you have appointments.
 Agenda: The Agenda view is a bit different from the other
views. It isn’t a time-based view like the others; it basically
lists your upcoming appointments. And in the list, you can see
details of the appointments, such as where and when.
Different views (like the ones shown in Figure 5-2) offer you a dif-
ferent focus on your schedule. Select the view you want based on
your scheduling needs and preferences. If your life is a little more
complicated, you can even use a combination of views for a full
grasp of your schedule.
Figure 5-2: Change your Calendar view to fit your life.
To switch between different Calendar views, simply follow these
steps:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Calendar.
Doing so calls up the Calendar application in its default
view — more than likely the day view.
2. Press the Menu key and select the view of your choice
from the menu that appears (shown in Figure 5-3).
If you start from Day view, your choices are View Week,
View Month, and View Agenda.
Chapter 5: Never Miss Another Appointment 65

Figure 5-3: The Calendar menu lets you select different views.
Moving between Time Frames
Depending on what view of Calendar you’re in, you can easily move
to the previous or the next date, week, month, or year.
For example, if you’re in the Month view, you can move to the next
month (um, relative to the currently displayed month). Likewise,
you can also move to the previous month. In fact, if you like to look
at things long term, you can jump ahead (or back) a year at a time.
(See Figure 5-4.)
Figure 5-4: Move between months or years in Month view.
You have similar flexibility when it comes to the other Calendar
views. See Table 5-1 for a summary of what’s available.

Furthermore, you can jump to any date of your choosing by press-
ing the Menu key and selecting Go to Date from the menu that
appears. Doing so calls up a handy little dialog box that lets you
choose the date you want. To change the date, scroll the trackball
to the desired day, month, and year, as shown in Figure 5-5.

Customizing Your Calendar
To change the initial (default) view in your Calendar — from Day
view to Month view, for example — Calendar Options is the answer.
To get to Calendar Options, open Calendar, press the Menu key,
and select Options from the menu that appears. You see choices
similar to the ones shown in Table 5-2.
Chapter 5: Never Miss Another Appointment 67

Description
Initial View
Specify the Calendar view that you first see when
opening Calendar.
Enable Quick Entry
In Day view only, Quick Entry allows you to make a
new appointment by typing characters. This way,
you don’t need to press the trackball and select
New. Note: If you enable this, Day view shortcuts
described on the cheat sheet (at the front of the
book) would not apply.
Default Reminder
How long your BlackBerry Pearl notifies you before
your appointment time. The default is 15 minutes.
Snooze
The snooze time when a reminder appears. The
default is 5 minutes.
Start of Day
The time of day that defines your Start of Day in Day
view. The default is 9 a.m. For example, if you
change this to 8 a.m., your Day view starts at 8 a.m.
instead of 9 a.m.
End of Day
The time of the day that defines End of Day in Day
view. The default is 5 p.m. If you change this to 6
p.m., for example, your Day view ends at 6 p.m.
instead of 5 p.m.
First Day of Week
The day that first appears in your Week view.
Confirm Delete
This option determines whether or not the Pearl
prompts you for confirmation upon appointment
deletion.
Show Free Time 
If yes, this field allows an appointment-free day’s 
in Agenda View 
date to appear in the Agenda view. If no, the
Agenda view will not show the date of days on
which you don’t have an appointment.
Show End Time 
If yes, this field shows the end time of each appoint-
in Agenda View
ment in the Agenda view. If no, the Agenda view
will show only the start time of each appointment.
Show Tasks
A task can be scheduled just like a Calendar event.
Number of Entries
The total number of appointments in your calendar
(past and future).

All Things Appointments: Adding,
Opening, and Deleting
After you master navigating the different Calendar views (and that
should take you all of about two minutes), and you have Calendar
customized to your heart’s content (another three minutes, tops),
it’s time (pun intended) to set up, review, and delete appointments.
We also show you how to set up a meeting with clients or colleagues.
Creating an appointment
Setting up a new appointment is easy. You need only one piece of
information: when your appointment occurs. Of course, you can
easily add related information about the appointment, such as the
meeting’s purpose, its location, and whatever additional notes are
helpful.
In addition to your standard one-time, limited-duration meeting,
you can also set all-day appointments. The BlackBerry Pearl can
assist you in setting recurring meetings as well as reminders.
Sweet!
Creating a one-time appointment
To add a new, one-time appointment, follow these steps:
1. Open Calendar.
2. Press the Menu key and select New.
The New Appointment screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 5-6.
Figure 5-6: Set an appointment here.
Chapter 5: Never Miss Another Appointment 69

3. Fill in the key appointment information.
Type all the information regarding your appointment in the
appropriate spaces. You should at least enter the time and
the subject of your appointment.
4. Press the Menu key and select Save.
This saves your newly created appointment.
Your new appointment is now in Calendar and viewable from any
Calendar view. Also, keep in mind that you can have more than one
appointment in the same time slot. Why? Well, the BlackBerry Pearl
Calendar allows conflicts in your schedule because it lets you make
the hard decision about which appointment you should forgo.
Creating an all-day appointment
If your appointment is an all-day event — for example, if you’re in
corporate training or have an all-day doctor’s appointment — mark
the All Day Event check box in the New Appointment screen, as
shown in Figure 5-7. You can do so by scrolling to the check box
and pressing the trackball. When this check box is checked, you
will not be able to specify the time of your appointment — just the
start date and end date (simply because it doesn’t make sense to
specify a time for an all-day event).
Figure 5-7: Set an all-day event here.
Setting your appointment reminder time
Any appointment you enter in Calendar can be associated with a
reminder alert — either a vibration or a beep, depending on how you
set things up in your profile. (For more on profiles, see Chapter 3.)
You can also choose to have no reminder for an appointment.
From the New Appointment screen, simply scroll to the Reminder
field and select a reminder time anywhere from none to 1 week
before your appointment time.
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Pearl 
70

Profile is simply another useful BlackBerry Pearl feature that
allows you to customize how your Pearl alerts you when an event
occurs. Examples of events are an e-mail, a phone call, or a
reminder for an appointment.
By default, whatever reminder alert you set goes off 15 minutes
before the event. But you don’t have to stick with the default. You
can choose your own default reminder time. Here’s how:
1. Open Calendar.
2. Press the Menu key and select Options.
Doing so calls up the Calendar Options screen.
3. Select Default Reminder.
4. Choose a default reminder time anywhere from none to 1
week before your appointment.
So from now on, any new appointment has a default reminder time
of what you just set up. Assuming that you have a reminder time
other than none, the next time you have an appointment coming
up, you see a dialog box like the one shown in Figure 5-8, remind-
ing you of an upcoming appointment.
Figure 5-8: You get a reminder dialog box if you want.
Creating a recurring appointment
You can set up recurring appointments based on daily, weekly,
monthly, or yearly recurrences. Everyone has some appointment
that repeats, such as birthdays or anniversaries (or taking out the
trash every Thursday at 7:30 a.m. — ugh).
For all recurrence types, you can define an Every field. For exam-
ple, say you have an appointment that recurs every nine days. Just
set the Recurrence field to Daily and the Every field to 9, as shown
in Figure 5-9.
Chapter 5: Never Miss Another Appointment 71

Figure 5-9: An appointment recurring every 9 days.
Depending on what you select in the Recurrence field, you have
the option to fill in other fields. If you enter Weekly in the
Recurrence field, for example, you have the option of filling in the
Day of the Week field. (It basically allows you to select the day of
the week on which your appointment recurs.)
If you enter Monthly or Yearly in the Recurrence field, the Relative
Date check box is available. With this check box checked, you can
ensure that your appointment recurs relative to today’s date. For
example, if you choose the following, your appointment occurs
every two months on the third Sunday until July 31, 2010:
Start: Sunday, June 18, 2006 at 12 p.m.
End: Sunday, June 18, 2006 at 1 p.m.
Recurrence: Monthly
Every: 2
Relative Date: Selected
End: Saturday, July 31, 2010
On the other hand, if all options in our example remain the same
except that Relative Date is not selected, your appointment occurs
every two months, on the 18th of the month until July 31, 2010.
If all this “relative” talk has you dizzy, don’t worry: The majority of
your appointments won’t be as complicated as this.
Opening an appointment
After you set an appointment, you can view it in a couple of ways.
If you’ve set up reminders for your appointment and the little
Reminder dialog box appears onscreen at the designated time
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Pearl 
72

before your appointment, you can view your appointment by click-
ing the box’s Open button (refer to Figure 5-8). Or you can open
the appointment from Calendar by going to the exact time of your
appointment and viewing it there.
While looking at an appointment, you have the option of making
changes (a new appointment time and new appointment location)
and then saving them.
Deleting an appointment
Deleting an appointment is straightforward. When in Day or Week
view, simply scroll to the appointment that you want to delete,
press the Menu key, and select Delete from the menu that appears.
If the appointment that you’re deleting is part of a recurring
appointment, a dialog box pops up asking whether you want to
delete all occurrences of this appointment or just this particular
occurrence, as shown in Figure 5-10. After you make your choice,
your appointment is history.
Figure 5-10: You can delete all occurrences or just the single instance of a
recurring appointment.

Chapter 6
Making Notes and Keeping
Your Words
In This Chapter
 Using MemoPad
 Managing your notes
 Keeping and retrieving your passwords
You know what a memo pad is. Most people take them to meet-
ings. Yes, you take them to those looong and sometimes
boooring meetings. Bored and need to stay awake? Your memo pad
is the answer. You can draw faces, doodle fanciful designs, or even
write a poem, all the while pretending to listen to the blabbering of
your colleagues or boss. What we describe in this chapter is your
e-memo pad for taking notes — the aptly named MemoPad — on
your BlackBerry. (Just no drawings faces, though.)
While we’re on this note-taking business, we’ll throw in the Password
Keeper; a secure way of keeping your passwords in your BlackBerry.
MemoPad
MemoPad on your BlackBerry can prove handy, indeed. If nothing
else, use it to jot important notes and ideas you might forget. How
many frustrating times do we have to endure for not remembering
a fleeting thought? We forget small things, and sometimes we forget
important ones. Writing down your thoughts is the best solution. Or
as you might expect from us, use your handy-dandy BlackBerry.
In upcoming sections, we explore how to jot down notes using
MemoPad as well as how to effectively organize your notes and
come back to them quickly using filters. And of course, more tips.

Accessing MemoPad
Accessing MemoPad is a snap. You can get to it using the Menu key
from the Home screen. The left screen of Figure 6-1 shows the link
to MemoPad from a T-Mobile Zen theme; a paper pad is the icon
representing the application.
Figure 6-1: Open MemoPad here (left); start a new note here (right).
Jotting down notes
After you open MemoPad, recording notes is a breeze. Simply
press the Menu key and select New. An empty memo screen
appears, as shown on the right of Figure 6-1. A line divides the
screen: The top field is for the title of your memo and the bottom
part is where you enter your memo. There is no limit on the size of
the memo as long as your BlackBerry has the capacity to store it.
When entering the note title, briefly describe the subject. If you use
long words and a font size of 9, five words are about the optimum.
The smaller the font, the more words you could fit on the screen.
You can enter more than six words — or as many as you want —
but remember that the BlackBerry screen isn’t wide. MemoPad dis-
plays the title as one line in the main MemoPad screen. If your note
title is longer than the width of the screen, the title is truncated
with an ellipsis (. . .) at its end.
Your MemoPad list is sorted alphabetically, so pay attention to
choosing a helpful first word when entering the title. Use descrip-
tive words and refrain from starting with A, An, The, This, and simi-
lar words.
Just like jotting down new memos, you can access all your memos
easily in the MemoPad list and act on them using the menu.
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Pearl 
76

Remember that the menu, just like in other applications, is always
available by pressing the Menu key. The menu options that appear
are in context with the currently selected memo, in this case giving
you View, Edit, and Delete menu items.
Viewing your notes
Obviously, you jot a memo for future reference. Viewing the memo
is the next logical step. After MemoPad is open, you can use the
trackball to scroll and highlight the memo you want to view. Simply
press the trackball and voila! A read-only screen displaying your
memo shows up.
If you’re not happy with the font size, whether it’s too small or too
big, Chapter 3 has the details on how to customize display fonts.
MemoPad is using the global preferences defined in Options
(Screen/Keyboard).
View is the default action for a highlighted memo. By pressing the
trackball, the highlighted memo displays in view or read-only
mode.
Updating your notes
Change is inevitable. Or perhaps you made a mistake in your note
taking. No problem. Updating your memo is easy. Just as when
viewing your contact, highlight the memo you want to edit from
the MemoPad list. Press the Menu key and select Edit. An editable
screen similar to the screen you used to add a memo shows up.
Make your edits and once you are contented, save them by press-
ing the Menu key and selecting Save.
Deleting your notes
Face it, half the sticky notes you find in your desk are no longer 
relevant. Your MemoPad is no different, so delete what you don’t
need. In your MemoPad list, highlight the memo you want to delete,
and press the DEL key. The Delete Memo confirmation screen
appears. Select Delete. Your memo is gone.
The confirmation screen you see when deleting a memo is a fea-
ture common to all out-of-the-box BlackBerry applications such as
Address Book, Tasks, Calendar, and MemoPad. It diminishes the
accidental deletion of records. You can enable or disable this fea-
ture. The ability to disable it is useful when you’re dishing out lots
of memos and don’t want to be bothered with a confirmation
Chapter 6: Making Notes and Keeping Your Words 77

screen for every memo to be deleted. (But then toggle the feature
back on when you’ve finished deleting.)
To turn off this feature, do the following:
1. In the MemoPad Options screen, highlight the Confirm
Delete field.
The screen currently displays Yes. No means you want to
toggle off the Confirmation screen.
2. Press the SPACE key.
The MemoPad Options screen updates to show No in the
Confirm Delete field.
3. Press the Menu key and select Save.
The MemoPad application applies the changes you made.
Another field you can see from the MemoPad Options screen is
Number of Entries. This field is just informational, showing you
how many memos you have in your MemoPad application.
Quickly finding a note
When you open MemoPad, the first thing you’ll see at the top of
the screen is the Find field. You’ll soon discover that this Find field
is always present on the main MemoPad screen. Next to Find is an
entry field. Just like the BlackBerry Address Book (see Chapter 4),
you can use the Find feature to find a note. (Ah, the importance of
good note naming becomes clearer all the time.)
Just start typing in the Find field, and the note list below shrinks
based on matches. A match is simply a hit, based on the starting
letters of all the words of the subjects in your list. As you type
more letters in the Find field, your MemoPad note list is filtered
more. For example, if you type id, Find filters the list for those
notes with subjects having words that start with id, such as ideas,
as you can see in Figure 6-2.
You may also organize your notes based on categories. Like in
Address Book and Tasks, you can group your notes and then filter
your note list based on a grouping. Simply define a group — a cate-
gory — and then assign that category to a note. The steps are the
same for Address Book, so refer to the “Using the Filter Feature on
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Pearl 
78

your contacts” section in Chapter 4 for a more detailed explanation
of how categories work and how to apply them.
Figure 6-2: Search notes here.
The Password Keeper
With so many pins, user names, and passwords you have to remem-
ber these days, it’s no wonder people tend to forget those that are
not used frequently. How many times have you clicked the “Forget
your id and password?” link on a Web site you’ve subscribed to?
Don’t head down to your local pharmacy for a memory enhancing
drug; take that safe out of your pocket instead. That’s right, among
the many features of your BlackBerry, the ability to keep those
passwords safe comes out of the box. We are talking here of the
Password Keeper application. It’s not only for passwords. You can
store your other important information, such as your bank account
numbers, your parent’s social security number, anything.
Accessing Password Keeper
Yes, you can find Password Keeper by pressing the Menu key from
the Home screen. Password Keeper is easy to spot because its icon
looks like a big metal safe, as shown in Figure 6-3. (Figure 6-3 is
taken from a T-Mobile Zen theme. Your Pearl will look different if
you’re using a different theme.)
Highlight the Password Keeper icon and press the trackball, and you
are on your way to a spot that’s more discrete than the Bat Cave.
Chapter 6: Making Notes and Keeping Your Words 79

Figure 6-3: Access Password Keeper here.
Setting a password for 
Password Keeper
The very first time you access Password Keeper, you’re prompted
to enter a password. Please be sure to remember the password you
choose because this is the password to all your passwords. In addi-
tion, you are prompted to enter this master password every time
you access Password Keeper.
We know it sounds perverse to set up yet another password to
help you manage your passwords, but trust us. Having to remem-
ber just one password is a lot easier than having to remember 17.
Later, if you want to change your master password to Password
Keeper — the password for opening Password Keeper itself —
simply follow these steps:
1. In the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Password Keeper.
The initial login screen for the Password Keeper applica-
tion appears.
2. Access Password Keeper by entering your old password.
3. With the Password Keeper application open, press the
Menu key and select Change Password.
The Change Password screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 6-4.
4. Enter a new password, confirm it, and then select OK.
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Pearl 
80

Figure 6-4: Change your Password Keeper password here.
Creating new credentials
Okay, so you’re ready to fire up your handy dandy Password Keeper
application. Now, what kinds of things does it expect you to do for
it to work its magic? Obviously, you’re going to need to collect the
pertinent info for all your various password-protected accounts so
that you can store them within the protected environs of Password
Keeper. So, when creating a new password entry, be sure you have
the following information (see the left screen of Figure 6-5):
 Title: This one’s straightforward. Just come up with a name to
describe the password-protected account — My Bank
Account, for example.
 Username: This is where you enter the user name for the
account.
 Password: Enter the password for the account here.
 Website: Put the Web site address (its URL) here.
 Notes: Not exactly crucial, but the Notes field gives you a bit
of room to add a comment or two.
The only required field is Title, but a title alone usually isn’t of
much use. We suggest that you fill in as much other information
here as possible, but at the same time be discreet about those loca-
tions where you use your user name and password — so don’t put
anything in the Website field or use My eBay Account as a title.
That way, if someone does somehow gain access to your password
to Password Keeper, the intruder will have a hard time figuring out
where exactly to use your credentials.
Chapter 6: Making Notes and Keeping Your Words 81

Figure 6-5: Set your new password here (left). A randomly generated 
password (right).
Random password generation
If you’re the kind of person who uses one password for everything
but knows deep in your heart that this is just plain wrong, wrong,
wrong, Random Password generation is for you. It’s quite simple.
When creating a new password for yet another online account (or
when changing your password for an online account you already
have), fire up Password Keeper, press the Menu key, and then select
Random Password from the menu that appears. Voilà! A new pass-
word is automatically generated, as shown in the right screen of
Figure 6-5.
Using Random Password generation with Password Keeper makes
sense because you don’t have to remember the randomly gener-
ated password that Password Keeper came up with for any of your
online accounts — that’s Password Keeper’s job.
Using your password
The whole point of Password Keeper is to let your BlackBerry’s
electronic brain do your password remembering for you. So, imag-
ine this scenario: You can no longer live without owning a personal
copy of the A Chipmunk Christmas CD, so you surf on over to your
favorite online music store and attempt to log in. You draw a blank
on your password, but instead of seething, you take out your
BlackBerry, open the Password Keeper application, highlight the
online site in your list, and press the trackball. The screen for your
account appears, conveniently listing the password that was just
on the tip of your tongue. All you have to do now is enter the pass-
word into the login screen for that online music store and Alvin,
Part II: Getting Organized with Your Pearl 
82

Simon, and Theodore will soon be wending their way to your
address, ready to sing “Chipmunk Jingle Bells.”
Yes, you do have the option of copying and pasting your password
from Password Keeper to another application — your BlackBerry
Browser, for instance. Just highlight the password name, press the
Menu key, and select Copy to Clipboard. Then navigate to where
you want to enter the password, press the Menu key, and select
Paste. Keep in mind that in order for the copy/paste function to
work for passwords from Password Keeper, you need to enable the
Allow Clipboard Copy option in the Password Keeper options (see
the upcoming Table 6-1).
After you paste your password in another application, clear the
Clipboard by pressing the Menu key and selecting Clear Clipboard.
The Clipboard keeps your last copied password until you clear it.
You can copy and paste only one password at a time.
Password Keeper options
The Options screen allows you to control how Password Keeper
behaves. For example, you can set what characters can make up a
randomly generated password. See Table 6-1 for a listing of all
options as well as descriptions of each one. To get to the Options
screen, open Password Keeper, press the Menu key, and select
Options.

Chapter 7
You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
In This Chapter
 Linking your e-mail accounts to your BlackBerry
 Mastering e-mail basics
 Searching your e-mail
 Saving messages
Your BlackBerry Pearl brings a fresh new face to the conven-
ience and ease-of-use that we associate with e-mail. You can
direct mail to your Pearl from up to ten e-mail accounts from the
likes of AOL and Yahoo!. You can set up an e-mail signature, config-
ure e-mail filters, and search for e-mails.
In this chapter, we show you how to use and manage the mail capa-
bilities of your Pearl to their full potential. From setup to sorts,
we’ve got you covered here.
Getting Up and Running 
with E-Mail
Regardless of your network service provider (such as T-Mobile or
Rogers or Vodafone), you can set up your BlackBerry Pearl to
receive mail from at least one of your current e-mail accounts.
Thus, with whatever address you use to send and receive e-mail
from your PC (Yahoo!, Gmail, and so on), you can hook up your
Pearl to use that same e-mail address. Instead of checking your
Gmail at the Google site, for example, you can now get it on your
BlackBerry Pearl.
Most network service providers allow you to connect up to ten
e-mail accounts to your BlackBerry. This provides you with the
convenience of one central point from which you get all your
e-mail, without having to log into multiple e-mail accounts. Such
convenience!

Using the BlackBerry Internet
Service client
You can pull together all your e-mail accounts into one by using
the BlackBerry Internet Service client (former known as BlackBerry
Web client). The BlackBerry Internet Service client allows you to
 Manage up to ten e-mail accounts: You can combine up to ten
of your e-mail accounts onto your BlackBerry. See the upcom-
ing section, “Combining your e-mail accounts into one.”
 Use wireless e-mail reconciliation: No more trying to match
your BlackBerry e-mail against e-mail in your combined
account(s). Just turn on wireless e-mail reconciliation and
you’re good to go. For more on this, see the upcoming section,
“Enabling wireless reconciliation.”
 Create e-mail filters: You can filter e-mails so that you get
only those e-mail messages that you truly care about on your
BlackBerry. See the section “Filtering your e-mail” near the
end of this chapter.
Think of the BlackBerry Internet Service client (Service client) as
an online e-mail account manager. Unlike other online e-mail
accounts, Service client doesn’t keep your e-mails. Instead, it
routes the e-mails from your other accounts to your BlackBerry
Pearl (because it’s directly connected to your Pearl).
Combining your e-mail 
accounts into one
To start aggregating e-mail accounts (like Gmail) onto your Pearl,
you must first run a setup program from the BlackBerry Internet
Service client. You can access the Service client from your
BlackBerry Pearl or from your desktop computer.
To access the Service client from your PC, you need the URL that is
specific to your network service. Contact your network service
provider for the URL and login information.
After you’ve logged into the Service client, you should see some-
thing similar to Figure 7-1. If your BlackBerry Pearl has been acti-
vated by your network provider, you should see one e-mail
address, the default address of your BlackBerry Pearl.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
88

Figure 7-1: Set up an e-mail account here.
From the Service client, you should see three options on the left
navigation bar:
 E-mail Accounts: Here, you can add, edit, and delete e-mail
accounts. In addition, for each e-mail address, you can set up
filters and an e-mail signature.

As mentioned, your BlackBerry Pearl already has a default e-mail
address with which you can receive and send e-mail. If you don’t
have any other e-mail account that you want to meld into your
BlackBerry e-mail account, simply skip to the upcoming
“Configuring your e-mail signature” section.
Adding an e-mail account
You can have up to ten e-mail accounts on your BlackBerry — this
is the good stuff right here. To add an e-mail account to your
BlackBerry account, follow these steps:
1. From the BlackBerry Internet Service client (refer to
Figure 7-1), click the Setup Account button.
You see the Add e-mail account screen.
2. From the Add e-mail account screen, enter the e-mail
address and login credentials for that e-mail address.
• The e-mail address is the address from which you
want to receive e-mail: for example, myid@yahoo.com.
• The account login is the one you use to log into this
particular e-mail account.
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail 89

• The password is the one you use associated with the
login.
3. Click the Next button.
You’re finished. It’s that easy!
You can also manage your accounts from your BlackBerry Pearl.
From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select Set up
Internet E-mail. The rest is pretty much the same on the
BlackBerry as it is on a PC.
Configuring your e-mail signature
By default, your e-mail signature is something like “Sent via My
BlackBerry” which can be cool in the first week, showing off to
people that you are a la mode with your BlackBerry Pearl. But
sooner or later, you might not want people to know you are out
and about while answering e-mail. Or you might want something
more personal. Follow these steps to configure your e-mail signa-
ture using the Service client:
1. Log into the Service client.
2. From the BlackBerry Internet Service client (refer to
Figure 7-1), click the Edit icon for the desired e-mail
account.
The edit screen appears, as show in Figure 7-2.
3. In the Signature field, type the desired text for your
e-mail signature.
4. Click Save.

Enabling wireless reconciliation
With wireless reconciliation, you don’t need to delete the same
e-mail in two places: The two e-mail in boxes reconcile with each
other, hence the term wireless reconciliation. Convenient, huh?
Enabling wireless e-mail synchronization
You can start wireless e-mail synchronization by configuring your
BlackBerry:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu Key and select
Messages.
This opens the Messages application. You see the 
message list.
2. In the message list, press the Menu key and select
Options.
The Options screen appears, with two option types:
General Options and Email Reconciliation.
3. Select Email Reconciliation.
This opens the Email Reconciliation screen, which has the
following options:
• Delete On: This option configures how BlackBerry
handles your e-mail deletion.
• Wireless Reconciliation: This option turns on or off
the wireless sync function.
• On Conflict: This option controls how BlackBerry han-
dles inconsistency between e-mail on your
BlackBerry versus BlackBerry Internet Service client.
You can choose who “wins” via this option: your
BlackBerry or the BlackBerry Internet Service client.
4. Select Delete On, and then select one of the following
from the drop-down list:
• Handheld: A delete on your BlackBerry takes effect on
your BlackBerry only.
• Mailbox & Handheld: A delete on your BlackBerry
takes effect on both your BlackBerry and your inbox
on BlackBerry Internet Service client.
• Prompt: This option prompts your BlackBerry to ask
you at the time of deletion.
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail 91

5. Select Wireless Reconciliation, and then select On from
the drop-down list.
6. Select On Conflict, and make a selection from the drop-
down list.
If you choose Handheld Wins, the e-mail in your e-mail
account will match the ones on the handheld.
Unfortunately, some e-mail accounts might not work well with the
e-mail reconciliation feature of the BlackBerry Pearl. So you might
have to delete an e-mail twice.
Permanently deleting e-mail from your BlackBerry
When deleting e-mail on your BlackBerry, the same message in that
e-mail account is placed in the Deleted folder. You can set up your
BlackBerry to permanently delete e-mail, but use this option with
caution — after that e-mail is gone, it’s gone.
To permanently delete e-mail on your Service client from your
BlackBerry, follow these steps:
1. Open the Messages application.
2. In the message list, press the Menu key and select
Options.
3. In the Options screen, select Email Reconciliation.
4. In the Email Reconciliation screen, press the Menu key
and select Purge Deleted Items.
A pop-up appears listing all your e-mail accounts.
5. From the pop-up menu, choose the e-mail account from
which you want to purge deleted items.
Another pop-up appears confirming that you are about to
purge deleted e-mails on your Service client.
6. Select Yes.
Deleted e-mails in the selected e-mail account are purged.
Unfortunately, some e-mail accounts might not work with the
purge deleted items feature.
Accessing Messages
From Messages, you send and receive your e-mails and also config-
ure wireless e-mail reconciliation with your e-mail account(s).
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
92

To access Messages, from the Home screen, press the Menu key
and select Messages. The first thing you see after opening Messages
is the message list. Your message list can contain e-mail, voice mail
messages, missed phone call notices, Short Messaging Service
(SMS) messages, and even saved Web pages.
Receiving e-mails
Whether you’re concerned about security or speed of delivery,
with BlackBerry Pearl’s up-to-date secured network, you’re in good
hands when receiving e-mail on your BlackBerry Pearl.
And whether you’ve aggregated accounts or just use the plain-
vanilla BlackBerry Pearl e-mail account, you receive your e-mail
the same way. When you receive an e-mail, your BlackBerry Pearl
notifies you by displaying a numeral next to a mail icon (an enve-
lope) at the top of the screen. This number represents how many
new (unread) e-mails you have. See Figure 7-3. The asterisk next to
the envelope indicates that there is new mail and you haven’t
opened the Messages application yet.
Your BlackBerry Pearl can also notify you of new e-mail by vibra-
tion or a sound alert or both. You can customize this from Profile,
as we detail in Chapter 3.
Figure 7-3: You’ve got (3) e-mails!
Retrieving e-mail
Retrieving your e-mail is simple:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Messages.
Doing so allows you to view your message list.
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail 93

2. In the message list, scroll to any e-mail and press the
trackball.
You can tell whether an e-mail is unopened by the small
unopened envelope icon on the left side of the e-mail. A
read e-mail bears an opened envelope icon, a sent e-mail
has a check mark as its icon, and a draft e-mail is repre-
sented by a document icon.
3. After you finish reading the message, press the Escape
key to return to the message list.
Saving a message to the saved folder
You can save any important e-mail into a folder so you can find it
without sorting through tons of e-mail. To do so, simply scroll to the
e-mail you want to save, press the Menu key, and select Save from
the menu. A pop-up message confirms that your e-mail has been
saved. Note: Your saved e-mail still remains in the message list.
To retrieve or view a saved e-mail, follow these steps:
1. Open the Messages application.
2. In the message list, press the Menu key and select View
Saved Messages.
You see the list of all the messages you saved.
3. Select the message you want and press the trackball to
open it.
Viewing attachments
Your BlackBerry Pearl is so versatile that you can view most e-mail
attachments just like you can on a desktop PC. And we’re talking
sizeable attachments, too, such as JPEGs (photos), Word docs,
PowerPoint slides, and Excel spreadsheets. Table 7-1 has a list of
supported attachment viewable from your BlackBerry Pearl.

However versatile your BlackBerry Pearl is, you can’t create cer-
tain types of attachments (MS Word, Excel, PDF) without help from
third-party software. Please refer to Chapter 17 for a productivity
program that can help you create Word docs and Excel spread-
sheets right from your BlackBerry Pearl and attach them in an
e-mail for you to send. However, you can attach pictures that are
stored on your BlackBerry Pearl. See Chapter 11 for details.
To tell whether an e-mail has an attachment, look for the standard
paperclip icon next to your e-mail in the message list.
You retrieve all the different types of attachments the same way.
This makes retrieving attachments an easy task. To open an attach-
ment, follow along:
1. While reading an e-mail, press the Menu key and select
Open Attachment.
You see a screen containing the name of the file, a Table of
Contents option, and a Full Contents option. For MS Word
documents, you can see different headings in outline form
in the Table of Contents option. For picture files, such as a
JPEG, you can simply go straight to the Full Contents
option to see the graphic.
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail 95

For all supported file types, you see Table of Contents and
Full Contents as options. Depending on the file type, use
your judgment on when you should use the Table of
Contents option.
2. Scroll to Full Contents, press the Menu key, and select
Retrieve.
Your BlackBerry Pearl attempts to contact the BlackBerry
server to retrieve your attachment. This retrieves only part
of your attachment. As you peruse a document, BlackBerry
Pearl retrieves more as you scroll through the attachment.
When you’re retrieving a picture, all parts of the attach-
ment will appear.
Sending e-mail
The first thing you probably want to do when you get your
BlackBerry Pearl is to write an e-mail to let your friends know that
you’ve just gotten a BlackBerry Pearl. Follow these steps:
1. Open the Messages application. In the message list, press
the Menu key and select Compose Email.
You are prompted with a blank e-mail that you just need to
fill out as you would do on you PC.
2. In the To field, type your recipient’s name or e-mail
address.
As you type, you’ll see a list of contacts from your Address
Book matching the name or address that you’re typing.
3. Type your message subject and body.
4. When you’re finished, press the Menu key and select
Send.
Your message has wings.
Forwarding e-mail
When you need to share an important e-mail with a colleague or a
friend, you can forward that e-mail. Simply do the following:
1. Open the e-mail.
For information on opening e-mail, see the previous sec-
tion, “Retrieving e-mail.”
2. Press the Menu key and select Forward.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
96

3. Type the recipient’s name or e-mail address in the appro-
priate space, then add a message if needed.
When you start typing your recipient’s name, a drop-down
list of your contacts will appear and you can choose from it.
4. Press the Menu key and select Send.
Your message is on its way to your recipient.
Saving a draft e-mail
Sometimes the most skillful wordsmiths find themselves lost for
words to express the message they want. Don’t fret, fellow word-
smith, you can save that e-mail composition as a draft until your
words come back to you. You only need to press the Menu key and
select Save Draft.
This saves your e-mail as a draft. When you’re ready to send your
message, choose the draft from the message list. You can tell
which messages are drafts because they sport a tiny Document
icon; finished messages have an envelope icon.
Adding a sender to 
your Address Book
You can add a message-sender’s contact info to your BlackBerry
Pearl Address Book directly from Messages. You don’t even have to
copy or write down the person’s name and e-mail address on paper.
To add a sender to your Address Book, follow these steps:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Messages.
2. In the message list, scroll to an e-mail and press the 
trackball.
3. From the open e-mail, scroll to the sender’s name, press
the trackball, and then choose Add to Address Book.
The New Address screen opens. The sender’s first name,
last name, and e-mail address are automatically transferred
to your Address Book.
4. If needed, add any additional information (such as a
phone number and a mailing address).
5. Press the Menu key and select Save.
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail 97

Filtering your e-mail
Most of us get e-mail that either isn’t urgent or doesn’t really con-
cern us. Instead of receiving them on your BlackBerry Pearl — and
wasting both time and effort to check them — you can filter them
out. While in the BlackBerry Pearl Internet Service client, set up fil-
ters to make your BlackBerry Pearl mailbox receive only those
e-mails that you care about. (Don’t worry; you’ll still receive them
on your main computer.)
We’ll create a simple filter that treats work-related messages as
urgent and forwards them to your BlackBerry Pearl. Follow these
steps:
1. Log into the BlackBerry Internet Service client (refer to
Figure 7-1).
2. Click the Filter icon for the desired e-mail account.
The Filter screen that appears shows a list of filters that
have been created. See Figure 7-4.
Figure 7-4: Filter list screen.
3. Click the Click here link.
The Add Filter screen appears, as shown in Figure 7-5.
Figure 7-5: Create a filter for your e-mail here.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
98

4. Enter a filter name.
The filter name can be anything you like. We entered
WorkUrgent.
5. In the Apply Filter When drop-down list, choose the con-
dition to place on the filter:
• A high-priority mail arrives: Select this option if the
filter applies only to urgent e-mail.
• Subject field contains: When selected, the Contains field
is enabled (you can type text into it). You can specify
what keywords the filter will look for in the subject
field. Separate each entry with a semicolon (;).
• From field contains: When selected, the Contains field
is enabled (you can type text into it). You can type in
full addresses or part of an address. For example, you
can type rob@robkao.com or just kao. Separate each
entry with a semicolon (;).
• To field contains: Works similar to From field contains.
• CC field contains: Works similar to From field contains.
To follow along with us, select From field contains.
6. Specify the text in the Contains field.
See details in the preceding step for what to enter in the
Contains field. Continuing our example, type the domain of
your work e-mail address. For example, if your work e-mail
address is myName@XYZCo.com, enter XYZCo.com.
7. Select one of the following options:
Forward Messages to Handheld: You can select either or
both of the following two check boxes:
• Header Only: Choose this if you want only the header
of the e-mails that meet the condition(s) you set in
Steps 3, 4, and 5 to be sent to you. (A header doesn’t
contain the body of the e-mail — just who sent it, the
subject, and the time it was sent.) You would choose
this if you get automated alerts, where receiving only
the subject is sufficient.
• Level 1 Notification: Level1 notification is another way
of saying urgent e-mail. When you receive a Level1
e-mail, it is bold in Messages.
Do Not Forward Message to Handheld: Selecting this
means that any e-mail that meets the conditions you set in
Steps 3, 4, and 5 will not be sent to your BlackBerry Pearl.
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail 99

8. Confirm your filter by clicking the Add Filter button.
You return to the Filter screen, where you can see your
newly created filter in the list.
If you have a hard time setting the criteria for a filter, just take a
best guess and then test it by having a friend send you a test
e-mail. If the test e-mail didn’t get filtered correctly, set the condi-
tions until you get them right.
Searching through Your 
Messages Like a Pro
Searching is one of those functions you probably won’t use every
day — but when you do run a search, you usually need the infor-
mation fast. Take a few minutes here to familiarize yourself with
the general search.
Running a general search
A general search is a broad search from which you can perform
keyword searches of your messages.
To run a general search:
1. Open the Messages application.
2. In the messages list, press the Menu key and select
Search.
3. In the Search screen that appears, fill in your search cri-
teria (see Figure 7-6).
Figure 7-6: The Search screen in Messages.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
100

The search criteria for a general search follow:
• Name: This is the name of the sender or recipient to
search by.
• In Field: This is related to the Name criterion. Use this
drop-down list to indicate where the name might
appear, such as in the To or Cc field. Your choices are
the From, To, Cc, Bcc, or any address fields.
• Subject: This is where you type some or all the key-
words that appear in the subject.
• Message: Here you enter keywords that appear in the
message.
• Service: If you set up your Pearl to receive e-mail from
more than one e-mail account, you can specify which
e-mail account to search for.
• Folder: This is the folder in which you want to per-
form the search. Generally, you should search all 
folders.
• Show: This drop-down list specifies how the search
result will appear: namely, whether you want to see
only e-mails that you sent or e-mails that you received.
From the drop-down list, your choices are Send and
Received, Received Only, Sent Only, Saved Only, Draft
Only, and Unopened Only.
• Type: This drop-down list specifies the type of mes-
sage that you’re trying to search for: e-mail, SMS, or
voice mail. From the drop-down list, your choices are:
All, Email, Email With Attachments, PIN, SMS, Phone,
Voice Mail.
From the Search screen shown in Figure 7-6, you can have
multiple search criteria or just a single one (up to you).
4. Press the Menu key and select Search to launch your
search.
The search results appear onscreen.
You can narrow the search results by performing a second search
on the initial results. For example, you can search by sender and
then narrow those hits by performing a second search by subject.
You can search by subject when you’re looking for a specific e-mail
titled by a specific subject that you already know. Just scroll to an
e-mail bearing the same specific subject you’re searching for, press
the Menu key, and select Search Subject.
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail 101

You can also search by sender or recipient when you’re looking for
a specific message from a specific person. To do so, scroll to an
e-mail bearing the specific sender or recipient. Press the Menu key
and select Search Sender or Search Recipient. If the e-mail that you
highlighted is an incoming e-mail, you’ll see Search Sender. On the
other hand, if the e-mail is outgoing, you’ll see Search Recipient.
Saving search results
If you find yourself re-searching by using the same criteria over
and over, you might want to save the search and then reuse it.
Here’s how:
1. Follow Steps 1 through 3 in the “Running a general
search” section for an outgoing e-mail search.
2. Press the Menu key and select Save.
The Search Save screen appears, from which you can name
your search and assign it a shortcut key. See Figure 7-7.
Figure 7-7: Name your search and assign a shortcut key.
3. In the Title field, enter a name.
The title is the name of your search, which appears in the
Search Result screen.
4. Scroll to Shortcut Key field, press the trackball, and
select a letter from the drop-down list.
You have ten letters to choose from.
5. Confirm your saved search by pressing the Menu key and
selecting Save.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
102

Reusing saved search results
Right out of the box, your BlackBerry Pearl comes with five saved
search results. Any new saved result will make your search that
much more robust.
To see all the saved search results:
1. Open the Messages application.
2. In the message list, press the Menu key and select Search.
3. Press the Menu key and select Recall.
The recall screen opens, and you can see the five pre-
loaded search shortcuts, as shown in Figure 7-8.
Figure 7-8: The recall screen, showing default search hot keys.
To reuse one of saved search results, simply select a desired search
from list in Figure 7-8, press the Menu key, and select Search.
Long Live E-Mail
No closet has unlimited space, and your BlackBerry Pearl e-mail
storage has limits, too. You’ve likely pondered how long your e-mails
are kept in your BlackBerry Pearl. (The default is 30 days. Pshew.)
You can choose several options: from 15 days to forever (well, for
as long as your BlackBerry Pearl has enough space for them).
Because any message you save is kept for as long as you want, a
good way to make sure you don’t lose an important message is to
save it.
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail 103

To change how long your e-mails live on your BlackBerry Pearl,
follow these steps:
1. Open Messages application.
2. Press the Menu key and select Options.
3. Select General Options.
4. Scroll to the Keep Messages option and press the 
trackball.
5. From the drop-down list that appears, choose the time
frame that you want and then press the trackball.
• Forever: If you choose Forever, you’ll seldom need to
worry about your e-mails being automatically deleted.
On the downside, though, you’ll eventually run out of
memory on your BlackBerry Pearl. At that point, you
must manually delete some e-mail so that you have
space to accept new e-mail.
A good way to archive your e-mail is to back up your
e-mails using BlackBerry Desktop Manager. See
Chapter 14 for more on backing up your Pearl on 
your PC. 
• Time option: If you choose a set-time option, any 
message older than that time frame is automatically
deleted from your BlackBerry Pearl the next time 
you reboot your Pearl. However, it will be deleted
only on your Pearl — even if you turn on e-mail 
reconciliation — because these deletions are not
completed manually by you.
6. Confirm your changes by pressing the Menu key and
selecting Save.

Chapter 8
Too Cool for E-Mail
In This Chapter
 Sending PIN-to-PIN messages
 Using Short and Multimedia Messaging Service (SMS/MMS)
 Setting up and using Instant Messenger (IM)
Your BlackBerry is primarily a communication tool, with e-mail
messages and phone conversations being the major drivers
here. The social creatures that people are, however, we constantly
come up with new ways to communicate — ever more ways to
overcome the distance barrier, as it were. You shouldn’t be sur-
prised that the folks at RIM have moved beyond e-mail and phon-
ing in their search for other ways to communicate. (And we’re not
talking semaphore or stringing together two tin cups.)
Not that we’re dismissing the power of phones or e-mail. Both are
wonderful technologies, but you might find yourself in a situation
where other means of communication would be more appropriate.
For instance, for instant messaging or chatting, e-mail is too slow
and cumbersome. Nor is e-mail really the best tool to use when
you want to alert someone.
“What might be a better fit?” you ask. Read this chapter to find out.
You can familiarize yourself with some of the less obvious ways
you can use your BlackBerry to communicate — ways that might
serve as the perfect fit for a special situation. You’ll get the inside
scoop on PIN-to-PIN messaging and text messaging (also known as
Short Messaging Service, or SMS). We also give you tips on how to
turn your BlackBerry into a lean (and not so mean) instant messag-
ing machine.

Sending and Receiving 
PIN-to-PIN Messages
What actually happens when you use PIN-to-PIN messaging? First
and foremost, get the acronym out of the way. PIN stands for per-
sonal identification number (familiar to anyone who’s ever used an
ATM) and refers to a system for uniquely identifying your device.
PIN-to-PIN, then, is another way of saying One BlackBerry to another
BlackBerry.
As for the other details, they’re straightforward. PIN-to-PIN messag-
ing is based on the technology underpinning two-way pager sys-
tems, which is fast. When you send a PIN-to-PIN message, unlike a
standard e-mail message, the message doesn’t venture outside
RIM’s infrastructure in search of an e-mail server and (eventually)
an e-mail inbox. Instead, the message stays solidly within the RIM
world, where it is shunted through the recipient’s network provider
until it ends up on the recipient’s BlackBerry. Trust us when we say
it’s fast. You have to try it to see the difference.
Getting a BlackBerry PIN
When you try to call somebody on the telephone, you can’t get far
without a telephone number. As you might expect, the same princi-
ple applies to PIN-to-PIN messaging: No PIN, no PIN-to-PIN messag-
ing. In practical terms, this means you need the individual PIN of
any BlackBerry device owned by whomever you want to send a PIN
message to. (You also need to find out your own PIN so you can
hand it out to those folks who want to PIN-message you.) The cau-
tious side of you might be thinking, “Now, why on earth would I
give my PIN to somebody?” This PIN is really not the same as your
password. In fact, this PIN doesn’t give anybody access to your
BlackBerry or do anything to compromise security. It’s simply an
identification; you treat it the same way as you treat your phone
number.
RIM makes getting hold of a PIN easy. In fact, RIM even provides
you with multiple paths to PIN enlightenment, as the following list
makes clear:
 From the Message screen: RIM makes it easy for you to send
your PIN from the Message screen with the help of a keyword.
A keyword is a neat feature with which you type a preset word,
and your BlackBerry replaces what you type with a bit of
information specific to your device.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
106

It’s easier than it sounds. To see what we mean, just compose
a new e-mail in the Message application. In the subject or
body of your message, type mypin and add a space. As soon
as you type the space, mypin is miraculously transformed into
your PIN in the format pin:your-pin-number. Isn’t that neat?
mypin isn’t the only keyword that RIM predefines for you.
 From the Status screen: You can find your PIN also on the
Status screen. From the Home screen, press the Menu key,
select Options, and then select Status to display the Status
screen.
Assigning PINs to names
So, you convince your BlackBerry-wielding buddies to go to the
trouble of finding out their PINs and passing said PINs to you. Now,
the trick is finding a convenient place to store your PINs so you can
use them. Luckily for you, you have an obvious choice: BlackBerry
Address Book. PIN is a contact field in Address Book. Refer to the
“Editing a Contact” section in Chapter 4 for getting that PIN infor-
mation into your buddies’ contact record.
Sending a PIN-to-PIN message
Sending a PIN-to-PIN message is no different than sending an
e-mail. Here’s how:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Address Book.
The Address Book opens.
2. Highlight a contact name, press the Menu key, and select
PIN <contact name>.
Say, for example, that you have a contact named Dante
Sarigumba. When you highlight Dante Sarigumba in the list
and press the Menu key, the menu item PIN Dante
Sarigumba appears as an option.
3. Press Enter.
The ever-familiar New Message screen, with the PIN of your
buddy already entered as an address, makes an appear-
ance. Treat the other e-mail-creation stuff — adding a sub-
ject line, entering the body of your message, and then
signing off — just as you would with a normal e-mail.
Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail 107

Because of the nature of PIN-to-PIN messaging (the conspicuous
lack of a paper trail, as it were), RIM has set it up so that compa-
nies can disable PIN-to-PIN messaging on your BlackBerry device.
(No paper trail can mean legal problems down the road — can you
say Sarbanes-Oxley?) If your BlackBerry Pearl is from your employer
and you don’t see the PIN menu item allowing you to send PIN-to-
PIN messages, you can safely assume that your employer has dis-
abled it. Contact your company’s BlackBerry administrator to make
sure. Keep in mind that even if your company has disabled PIN-to-
PIN messaging, folks can still PIN you — you just won’t be able to
PIN them back in response.
Receiving a PIN-to-PIN message
Receiving a PIN-to-PIN message is no different than receiving a
standard e-mail. You get the same entry into your Messages list for
the PIN-to-PIN message that you receive, and the same message
screen displays when you open the message. By default, your
BlackBerry vibrates to alert you, but this behavior can be cus-
tomized in Profiles. In Profiles, PIN-to-PIN is a Level1 message.
(Check Chapter 3 for details on changing your Profile.) When you
reply to the message, the reply is a PIN-to-PIN message as well —
that is, as long as your BlackBerry is set up to send PIN-to-PIN 
messages.
Keeping in Touch, the 
SMS/MMS Way
Short Messaging Service (also known as SMS, or simply text mes-
saging) is so popular these days that even the Fox Network TV
show American Idol lets you vote for the show’s contestants through
SMS. Moreover, SMS is an established technology (not a new and
unproven thing, in other words) that has been popular for years in
Europe and Asia, where the Global System for Mobile Communica-
tion (GSM) is the technology of choice among cellphone network
providers. How short is short? The maximum size per message is
about 160 characters. If you send more than that, your message
gets broken down into multiple messages.
Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is the latest evolution of SMS.
Instead of a simple text message, you can send someone an audio
or video clip.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl

Sending a text or multimedia 
message
Whether you want to send a short text (SMS) message or a richer
audio/video (MMS) message, the steps are similar and simple. It’s
message sending time! Here’s how it’s done:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Address Book.
Address Book opens. Alternatively, if the Address Book
icon is displayed on the Home screen, simply select it.
2. Highlight a contact with a cellphone number, press the
Menu key, and select SMS or MMS <contact name>.
The menu item for SMS or MMS is intelligent enough to dis-
play the name of the contact. For example, if you choose
John Doe, the menu item reads SMS John Doe or MMS John
Doe. If you choose SMS, skip Step 3 and proceed directly to
Step 4.
3. Browse from your multimedia folders and select the
audio or video file you want to send.
When choosing MMS, this extra step allows you to choose
the multimedia file. This is the only difference between SMS
and MMS with regards to sending a message.
4. Type your message.
5. Press the Menu key and select Send.
Your SMS/MMS message is sent on its merry way.
Viewing or listening to 
a message you receive
If you have an incoming SMS or MMS message, you get notification
just like you do when you receive an e-mail. Also, like e-mail, the
E-mail icon on the top of the Home screen indicates the arrival of 
a new message. In fact, everything about viewing SMS/MMS mes-
sages is pretty much the same as what you do when reading e-mail
messages; so if you have Chapter 7 loaded into your memory, you
know how to read SMS/MMS messages.
Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail 109

You can customize how your BlackBerry notifies you when you
receive an SMS message. Chapter 3 has the scoop on all the cus-
tomization options for your BlackBerry, including options for SMS
notification. (Look for the section about customizing your Profile.)
Always Online Using 
Instant Messaging
Real-time conversation with your friends or buddies over the
Internet is easier with the advent of Instant Messenger. This tech-
nology allows two or more people to send and receive messages
quickly with the use of software that uses the Internet as the wire.
It all started with pure text messages and evolved into a rich
medium involving voice and even video conversation in real-time.
Chatting using IM rules
When America Online (AOL) came out with Instant Messenger (IM)
in the mid-1990s, it was an overnight hit. What made it successful
was that it could provide quick (instantaneous) responses to any
messages you sent. In addition, the service introduced many simple
(yet clever) functions that offer a unique way of communicating.
For example, you can chat with multiple people at the same time.
You can tell whether someone is trying to type a message to you.
You can even tell whether your buddies are online, away from their
computers, or simply too busy to be interrupted at the moment. 
IM adds up to a totally different slant on long-distance communica-
tion, opening a wide array of possibilities — possibilities that can
be used for good (team collaboration) or ill (mindless gossip),
depending on the situation.
As you might expect, IM is great for both personal and business
applications. In the business world, IM provides the link so that
employees can be always connected with their colleagues, no
matter how distant they might be, making working collaboratively
far easier. On the personal side, this new way of keeping in touch
has been embraced by a pretty broad swath of the population —
not just the teen set. Whether you’re busy maintaining friendships
or working to create new ones, Instant Messenger is one powerful
tool to consider adding to your social skills toolbox.
If your employer provides your BlackBerry Pearl, IM might not
work on your device. Companies have the option of telling their
network administrators to block all IM network addresses, effec-
tively shutting you out of the IM system. If that’s the case, your
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
110

chances of being able to use IM on your BlackBerry Pearl are zero.
(You can always get your own personal BlackBerry Pearl, though.)
IM basics: What you need
Your Blackberry Pearl comes with an IM application supporting the
four leading IM networks. All you need to start using IM is a user ID
and a password. If you don’t have a user ID/password combo yet,
getting one is a breeze. Just go to the appropriate registration Web
page (listed next) for the IM network you want to use. Use your desk-
top or laptop machine for signing up. It’s easier and faster that way.
 AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)
http://aim.aol.com/aimnew/Aim/register.adp?
promo=106723&pageset=Aim&client=no
 ICQ Instant Messenger
http://www.icq.com/register
 MSN Messenger
http://messenger.msn.com/download/getstarted.aspx
 Yahoo! Instant Messenger (Y! IM)
http://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_register?
.src=pg&.done=http://messenger.yahoo.com
Given the many IM network choices available, all your friends
probably won’t be registered on the same network. You might end
up having to sign up for multiple networks if you want to reach
them all through IM.
If you’re an avid user of GoogleTalk, don’t be dismayed by not
seeing it in the preceding list. RIM has a separate program that you
can use. Just point Browser to this link:
http://www.blackberry.com/GoogleTalk/index.do
The page that appears gives you step-by-step instructions on how
to download and install the program on your BlackBerry Pearl.
Going online with IM
After you obtain a user ID/password combo on one of the IM 
services, you can start chatting with your buddies by following
these steps:
Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail 111

1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Instant Messaging.
A screen displaying the four popular IM services appears,
as shown in Figure 8-1. You can choose from any of the four
IM application icons, based on where your ID is valid.
Figure 8-1: Links to the four IM services.
2. Highlight the IM application icon of your choice and
press Enter.
An application-specific login screen appears for you to sign
in. They’re all straightforward, with the standard screen
name or ID line and password line. Each screen also offers
a Save Password check box; when enabled, it allows you to
keep the ID/password information pre-entered next time
you come back to this screen. (Um, you don’t have to type
this stuff every time you want to IM.) We recommend that
you mark this check box to save time, but also set your
handheld password enabled so that security is not compro-
mised. Refer to Chapter 3 if you need a refresher on how to
enable password on your BlackBerry.
3. Enter your screen name or ID and password and select
the Save Password check box (if desired).
4. Press the trackball and select Sign On.
At this point, IM tries to log you in. This can take a couple
of seconds. After you’re logged in, a simple listing of your
contacts/buddies (AIM refers to contacts as buddies) shows
up onscreen.
5. In the list, highlight the contact/buddy you’d like to chat
with, press the Menu key, and select the action you’d like
from the menu that appears.
Your menu options are sending a message, add a contact,
deleting a contact, and more.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
112

Adding a contact/buddy
Before you can start chatting with your buddies, you need to know
their user IDs as well. For AIM, you get the ID from your friend, or
you can search AOL’s directory. For Yahoo! users, the ID can be
found on their Yahoo! e-mail addresses. (It’s the text before the @
sign.) ICQ uses an ICQ number as a user ID. Again, you can always
have your friend e-mail it to you or you can search the ICQ Global
Directory. For MSN, you need their MSN passport ID or their
Hotmail ID.
Luckily for you, you don’t need to search around for IDs every time
you want to IM someone. IM lets you store IDs as part of a contact
list so you can grab an ID whenever you need one. To add the ID of
a contact to your contact list, just do the following:
1. Starting within the IM service of your choice, press the
Menu key and select Add Buddy.
The Add Buddy/Contact screen appears.
2. Enter the user ID of your buddy and then press Enter.
IM is smart enough to figure out whether this contact is a
valid user ID or not. If the ID is valid, the application adds
the ID to your list of contacts. The buddy goes to either the
Online or Offline section of your list, depending on whether
your buddy is logged in.
Doing the chat thing
Suppose you want to start a conversation with one of your con-
tacts (a safe assumption on our part, we think). Just log in to the
IM application, as described previously, and send a message to
your buddy. By sending a message within the IM application,
you’re initiating a conversation. Here are all the details on how 
to do it:
1. In the contacts list of the IM application of your choice,
highlight the contact to whom you want to send a mes-
sage, press the Menu key, and then select Send a Message.
A typical online chat screen shows up. The top portion of
the screen lists the sequence of previous messages you
sent to and received from this contact. The bottom portion
of the screen is where you type your message.
2. Enter your message.
Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail 113

3. Press the Menu key and select Send.
Your user ID plus the message you just sent shows up in
the topmost (history) section of the chat screen. When you
receive a message, it gets appended to the history section as
well so that both sides of your e-conversation stay in view.
Using BlackBerry Messenger
RIM itself has entered the IM application horse race in the form of
a spirited filly named — you guessed it — BlackBerry Messenger.
This application is based on the PIN-to-PIN messaging technology
described earlier in this chapter, which means that it is mucho fast
and quite reliable. However, with BlackBerry Messenger, you can
chat with only those buddies who have a BlackBerry and also have
PIN-to-PIN messaging enabled. The application supports IM features
common to many of the other applications, like group chatting and
the capability to monitor the availability of other IM buddies.
Running BlackBerry Messenger
You can access the BlackBerry Messenger by pressing the Menu
key from the Home screen and selecting BlackBerry Messenger.
The very first time you run BlackBerry Messenger, the application
throws up a dialog box asking you for your display name. The
application also asks you to define a password in case you need to
restore your contact list at some point.
The next time you open the application, you see an IM-style con-
tact list, as shown on the left in Figure 8-2. (Okay, we know it looks
pretty empty right now, but we show you how to populate it in a
minute.) To customize the groupings, add a contact, set your avail-
ability, start a conversation, or change your options, just press the
Menu key to call up the BlackBerry Messenger menu, as shown on
the right in Figure 8-2.
Figure 8-2: The BlackBerry Messenger contact list (left) and menu (right).
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
114

Adding a contact
With nobody in your contact list, BlackBerry Messenger is a pretty
useless item. Your first order of business is to add a contact to
your list — someone you know who has a BlackBerry, is entered in
your Address Book, has PIN-to-PIN messaging enabled, and has a
copy of BlackBerry Messenger installed on his or her device. If you
know someone who fits these criteria, you can add that person to
your list by doing the following:
1. In BlackBerry Messenger, press the Menu key and select
Add a Contact.
A listing of all the contacts in your BlackBerry Address
Book shows up onscreen.
2. Highlight the name you want to add to your BlackBerry
Messenger contact list and then press the trackball.
The Add a Message dialog box similar to the one shown in
Figure 8-3 (left) appears.
Figure 8-3: Requesting permission to add contact to BlackBerry Messenger
(left). To-be-approved contacts are in the Pending group (right).
3. Select OK from the popup.
Another message dialog box appears, specifying that a
message was sent to your potential contact.
Most IM applications ask a potential contact for permission
to add him or her to someone’s contact list. BlackBerry
Messenger is no different here.
The application sends your request for the contact to be
added to your BlackBerry Messenger contact list. As long
as the person has not responded to your request, his or
her name appears as part of the Pending group, as shown
in Figure 8-3 (right). When your contact responds positively
to your request, that name is moved from the Pending
group to the official contact list.
Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail 115

Starting a conversation
You can easily start a conversation with any of your contacts
through the BlackBerry Messenger main menu:
1. Highlight a name from your contact list, press the Menu
key, and select Start Conversation.
A traditional chat interface appears, with a historical listing
of messages at the top and a text box for typing messages
at the bottom.
2. Type your message.
3. Press the Enter key to send the message.
Any messages you send (as well as any responses you get
in return) are appended to the History list at the top.
Starting a group conversation
Whenever you’re conversing with someone using your BlackBerry
Messenger, you can easily invite others in, as follows:
1. Press the Menu key and select Invite.
This option allows you to select any number of people from
your contact list one at a time from the Select a Contact
screen that follows.
2. Select the contact or contacts and then select OK.
You return to the previous conversation screen, but now
the History list, which is the listing of your previous con-
versations, appends text saying that the names of your con-
tacts have been added to the conversation. The newly
selected contacts can now join in the conversation.

Surfing the Internet Wave
In This Chapter
 Using the BlackBerry Browser to surf the Web
 Mastering browser shortcuts and navigation tips
 Using bookmarks
 Customizing and optimizing Browser
I
t’s hard to believe that just over ten years ago, more folks didn’t
have access to the Internet than did. Today, you can surf the
Web anytime, anywhere, and you can do it using a traditional desk-
top or laptop computer, or even a tiny mobile device such as a
PDA or a smartphone. Having said that, it should be no surprise
that your BlackBerry Pearl has a Web browser of its own.
In this chapter, we explore ways to use the BlackBerry Browser
effectively. We offer shortcuts that improve your experience brows-
ing the Web. We also throw in timesaving tips, including the
coolest ways to customize your browser to make pages load faster
and a complete neat-freak’s guide to managing your bookmarks.
Getting Started with the
BlackBerry Browser
Browser is preloaded on your BlackBerry Pearl and accesses the
Web by cellphone connection. The following sections get you
started using Browser. After you get your feet wet, we promise that
you’ll be chomping at the bit to find out more!
Accessing Browser
You can open Browser by pressing the Menu key from the Home
screen and selecting Browser. Alternatively, if you see the Browser
icon from the Home screen, you can select it.

You can also access the Browser from any application that distin-
guishes a Web address. For example, from Address Book, you can
scroll to a Web page field, press the trackball, and select Get Link.
The Browser launches and the Web page starts opening. Also, if
you get an e-mail containing a Web address, just scroll to that link.
The link becomes highlighted, and you can open the page by press-
ing the trackball and selecting Get Link.
When you access Browser from another application (see Figure 9-1,
left), you don’t have to close that application to jump to Browser.
Just press the Menu key, select Switch Application to bring up a
pop-up screen containing application icons, and select Browser.
(It’s the globe icon.)
Figure 9-1: Open Browser from another application (left). The opening Browser
screen (right).
By default, accessing Browser by clicking a Web address within
another application opens the Web page associated with that
address. Opening Browser from the Home screen menu gives you a
list of bookmarks.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
118
Small screen, small images
Like other similar devices, the BlackBerry has limited screen real estate and should
not be compared with personal computers in terms of a Web-browsing experience.
The screen is just too small to accommodate a normal Web page. Also, remember
that your connection is via a cellphone network, so your connection speed varies
from location to location and isn’t as speedy as a Wi-Fi or cable connection. Pictures
and images won’t look the same, and pages might take longer to load. (The good
news is that you don’t have to endure nasty pop-ups.) Despite the limited capacity
(compared with a traditional Web browser), when you really need information and
you’re away from a computer, your BlackBerry is there for you.

If you haven’t yet added bookmarks, the opening Browser screen
looks like the right screen in Figure 9-1. You find out more about
adding bookmarks later in this chapter.
Hitting the (air)waves
After you open Browser, you’re ready to surf the Web. Here’s how:
1. Open Browser.
2. Press the Menu key and select Go To.
3. In the screen that appears, enter a Web address, as
shown in Figure 9-2, and then select OK.
The Web page appears.
Figure 9-2: Opening a Web page is simple.
When you see a phone number or an e-mail address on a Web
page, you can scroll to that information to highlight it. When the
information is highlighted, pressing the trackball initiates a phone
call or opens a new e-mail message (depending on which type of
link you highlighted).
Navigating Web pages
Using Browser to navigate a Web page is easy. Note that hyperlinks
are highlighted onscreen. To jump to a particular hyperlink, scroll
to the highlighted link and press the trackball.
Here are few shortcuts you can use while navigating a Web page:
 Quickly move up and down one full display page at a time by
pressing 9 (down arrow) or 3 (up arrow).
 Move to the top of the page: ER key.
Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave 119

 Move to the bottom of the page: CV key.
 Move to the next page: M or SPACE key.
 Move to the previous page: UI key.
 Quickly switch between full-screen mode and normal mode by
pressing the exclamation point (!) key. Think of full-screen
mode simply as another way to view the same Web page on
your BlackBerry, but the BlackBerry doesn’t show anything
extra (for example, signals level) on the top portion of the dis-
play screen. Normal mode is what you get by default.
 To stop loading a page, press the Escape key.
 After a page fully loads, you can go back to the previous page
by pressing the Escape key.
And don’t forget the Browser menu (press the Menu key). It has
some useful shortcuts, as shown in Figure 9-3.
Figure 9-3: The Browser menu has lots of good stuff.
Here are the Browser menu options:
 Find: Use this option to find text within the current page. Like
any other basic Find tool, choosing this option displays a
prompt to enter the text you want to find. Then a Find Next
menu appears after the initial search for you to use to find the
next matching text.
 Copy: This menu item appears if a link is currently high-
lighted. Choosing this option copies text you highlighted into
memory so that you can use it later for pasting elsewhere,
such as your MemoPad.
 Get Link: This menu item shows up if you have a currently
highlighted link. Choosing this menu item opens that page of
the link. Hint: The faster way to open a link is to press the
trackball, as mentioned earlier.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
120

 Home: This is the shortcut to go to your home page. The
default home page can vary from carrier to carrier, but you
can change it by displaying the Browser menu and selecting
Options, and then selecting Browser Configuration. From
there, you can change the Home Page Address field.
 Go To: Choosing this allows you to open a Web page by enter-
ing the Web address and selecting OK. As you enter more
addresses, the ones you entered before are listed and stored
for possible future usage, to save you having to type them
again. To find out how to clear that list, see the “Cache
Operations” section.
 Back <Esc>: Choose this to go back to the previous page you
viewed.
 Forward: If you’ve gone back at least one Web page in your
browsing travels, use Forward to progress one page at a time.
 Recent Pages: Choosing this displays a list of the pages you
have viewed previously. This is a convenient way of revisiting
pages that you have just viewed.
 History: Browser can track up to 20 pages of Web addresses
you’ve visited, which you can view on the History screen.
From there, you can jump to any of those Web pages by high-
lighting the page and pressing the trackball.
 Refresh: Choosing this option updates the current page. This
is helpful when you’re viewing a page with data that changes
frequently (such as stock quotes).
 Set Encoding: Choose this to specify the encoding used in
viewing a Web page. This is useful when viewing foreign lan-
guages that use different characters. Most of us don’t have to
deal with this and probably don’t know what type of encoding
a particular language could display. If you have to do this,
make sure you know the appropriate encoding.
At the upper-right corner of the Browser screen are a couple of
icons. The rightmost icon shows the strength of the network sig-
nals (it’s the same signal indicator for phone and e-mail). The icon
to the left of that indicates whether you’re at a secure Web page. In
this case, it is a normal page. Whether a page is secure or not
depends on the Web site you’re visiting. If you’re accessing bank-
ing information, you most likely see the secured icon (a closed
lock). On the other hand, most informational pages need not be
secure, so you see the unsecured icon (an open lock). Hint: The
Web address of a secure page starts with https instead of http.
If you lose patience waiting for a page to load and want to browse
somewhere else, press the Escape key to stop the page from loading.
Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave 121

Saving a Web page address
Entering a Web address to view a page can get tedious. Fortunately,
you can return to a page without manually entering the same
address. While you’re viewing a Web page, simply use the Browser
menu (shown on the left in Figure 9-4) to save that page’s address.
Figure 9-4: Use the Browser menu to save a Web page address (left). Save a
Web page link in Messages (right).
You can save a Web page address in a couple of ways:
 Page Address: This option allows you to view the Web
address of the current page through a pop-up screen. From
this pop-up screen, you can save the page’s address on your
BlackBerry Clipboard and paste it in as a memo for yourself or
send it to yourself or somebody else via Messages (e-mail).
Convenient, right?
When you select Send Address from the pop-up menu, you’re
taken to Address Book to select your e-mail recipient, and the
rest is the same as sending a regular e-mail. See Chapter 7 for
more on sending e-mail messages.
 Save Page: Use this option to save the Web address of the 
current page to Messages. A message appears with the
Browser globe icon to indicate that it’s a Web link, as shown
on the right in Figure 9-4. Scrolling to that entry and pressing
Enter launches Browser and opens the page for your viewing
pleasure. Saving a page to your message list has a different
purpose than bookmarking a page. When you save a page to
your message list, you can mark the page as unread, like an
e-mail message, to remind yourself to check back later.
Note: When you do not have network coverage and you try to access
a Web page, you’re prompted to save your request. When you do,
your request is automatically saved in the message list. Then, when
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
122

you do have coverage later, you can open the same Web page from
the message list, and it has the loaded content already!
Pressing a letter key while you’re in a menu selects the first menu
item that starts with that letter. Pressing the same letter again
selects the next menu item that starts with that letter.
Sending an address by e-mail
You can send a Web address to any recipient via e-mail using the
Page Address option in the Browser menu. For a more direct way,
simply select Send Address from the Browser menu while the Web
page is displayed. If you know right away that you’re going to send
an address to someone, use the more direct method. It saves you a
couple of clicks.
Saving Web images
You can view and save pictures or images from a Web page. Any
saved image can be accessed using the Picture application, which
enables you to view it later, even when you’re out of range. To save
the image from the Web page, select the image and then select
Save Image from the menu that appears.
Bookmarking Your Favorite Sites
You don’t have to memorize each address of your favorite sites.
BlackBerry Browser allows you to keep a list of sites you want to
revisit. In other words, make a bookmark so you can come back to
a site quickly.
Adding a bookmark
On the page you want to bookmark, select Add Bookmark from the
Browser menu. Remember that the menu is always accessible by
pressing the Menu key. Enter the name of the bookmark and then
select the folder where you want to save the bookmark in the
Bookmark dialog box (as shown in Figure 9-5). The default folder is
BlackBerry Bookmarks, but you can save the bookmark in folders
you create. To see how to create a bookmark folder, skip to the sec-
tion, “Adding a bookmark subfolder.”
The next time you want to go to a bookmarked page, return to the
Bookmarks screen by selecting Bookmarks from the Browser menu.
From this screen, you can find all the pages you bookmarked. Just
Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave 123

highlight the name of the bookmark and press the trackball to open
that page.
Figure 9-5: Specify the name and the folder in which to store the bookmark.
Available offline
The Bookmark dialog box includes an Available Offline check box,
which you might be wondering about. If that check box is checked,
you not only save a page as a bookmark, you also cache it so you
can view it even when you are out of network coverage (like being
stuck deep in a mountain cave). The next time you click the book-
mark, that page comes up very fast because Browser is retrieving
the page from its cache.
If you want the latest version of the page, you have to refresh it. To
do so, press the Menu key and select Refresh.
We recommend you make bookmarks to search engines (such as
Google) available offline because the content of the initial search
page is not likely to change from day to day.
Modifying a bookmark
Changing a bookmark is a snap:
1. Go to the Bookmarks screen.
To do so, select Bookmarks from the Browser menu.
2. Highlight the name of the bookmark you want to modify
and then select Edit Bookmark from the menu.
3. On the screen that follows, you can edit the existing
name or the address the bookmark is pointing to or both.
4. Click OK to save your changes.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
124

Organizing your bookmarks
Over time, the number of your bookmarks will grow, and having a
tiny display screen can make it tough to find a certain site. To miti-
gate this problem, organize your bookmarks by using folders. For
example, you can group related sites in a folder, and each folder
can have one or more folders inside it (subfolders). In a way, you
can build a tree hierarchy for your bookmarks. Having a folder
hierarchy narrows down your search and allows you to easily find
the site you’re looking for.
Adding a bookmark subfolder
Unfortunately, you can add subfolders only to existing folders that
are already listed on the Bookmarks page. Nevertheless, you can
still get organized by using subfolders.
Suppose that you want to add a subfolder called Hockey Links
within your BlackBerry Bookmarks folder. Here are the quick and
easy steps to do so:
1. On the Bookmarks screen, highlight BlackBerry
Bookmarks.
The initial folder you highlight will be the parent of the new
subfolder.
2. Press the Menu key and select Add Subfolder.
You see a dialog box where you can enter the name of the
folder.
3. Enter Hockey Links as the name of the folder and 
select OK.
The Hockey Links folder appears on the Bookmarks screen
bearing a folder icon.
Renaming a bookmark folder
Renaming a bookmark folder is as easy as editing a bookmark. On
the Bookmarks screen, highlight the name of the folder, press the
menu key, and select Rename Folder. On the screen that follows, you
can edit the name of the folder. To save your changes, select OK.
Moving your bookmarks
If you keep going astray looking for a bookmark that you think
exists in a particular folder but is instead in another, move that
bookmark where it belongs:
Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave 125

1. Highlight the bookmark, press the Menu key, and select
Move Bookmark.
2. Use the trackball to move the bookmark to the location
on the list where you want it to appear.
3. After you find the right location, press the trackball.
Your bookmark is in its new home.
Cleaning up your bookmarks
Cleaning up your bookmarks list can help you keep organized and
is easy. On the Bookmarks screen, highlight the name of the book-
mark you want to delete, press the Menu key, and select Delete.
You can clean up bookmarks wholesale by deleting an entire folder.
However, if you delete a folder, you delete the contents of that
folder as well, so purge with caution.
Browser Options and Optimization
Techniques
The Browser Options screen offers three main categories of set-
tings to choose from, as shown in Figure 9-6:
 Browser configuration
 General properties
 Cache operations
Figure 9-6: The Browser Options screen.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
126

Browser Configuration screen
You can define browser-specific settings from the Browser
Configuration screen, which you access from the Browser Options
screen. The list of customization items you can amend (shown to
the left of Figure 9-7) are as follows:
 Setting up your home page.
 Setting the content mode you want viewed: WML, HTML, or
both. Think of WML pages as Web pages made just for mobile
devices such as the BlackBerry. We recommend you leave this
as WML or both.
 Controlling the display of images depending on the 
content mode.
 Turning on/off the display of image placeholders if you opt
to not display images.
 Specifying which browser type your browser emulates. The
default is BlackBerry, but Browser can emulate Microsoft
Internet Explorer, Openwave (WAP), Openwave Gateway,
Microsoft Pocket IE, or Netscape. We don’t see much differ-
ence in behavior, so we recommend that you stick with the
default BlackBerry mode.
 Support of HTML tables. A page with HTML tables might look
different if this is disabled.
 Use of foreground and background colors.
 Use of background images.
 Support of embedded media such as Flash and SVG. SVG
stands for scalable vector graphics. Think of it as Flash for
mobile devices such as the BlackBerry. It can be a still image
or an animated one.
 Support of JavaScript. A Web page might not behave nor-
mally when this option is off.
 Enable/suppressed JavaScript pop-ups.
 Support of Cascading Style Sheets.
Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave 127

Figure 9-7: The Browser Configuration screen (left). The General Properties
screen (right).
General Properties screen
The General Properties screen has the same function as the Browser
Configuration screen (see the preceding section) in that you can
customize some behaviors of Browser. This screen, however, is
geared more toward the features of the browser content. As shown
to the right of Figure 9-7, you can configure and turn on and off
more features.
From this screen, you use the SPACE key to change the value of a
field. You can configure the following features by selecting from the
provided choices. Following this list are the General Properties
screen options that you configure through on-and-off toggles.
 Enable/disable prompting when closing the browser. You can
be notified before you do the following actions as a precaution:
• Closing Browser on Escape: Notified right before you exit
BlackBerry Browser.
• Closing Modified Pages: Notified right before you exit a
modified Web page (for example, some type of online
form you fill out).
• Running WML Scripts: Notified right before a WML script
runs.
 Change the default font and font size. You can change these
settings by first highlighting them one at a time and then
pressing the trackball, which displays a list of choices. Then
scroll to the choice you like and press the trackball.
 Set the number of times an animation repeats. The default is
100 Times but you can change this setting to Never, Once, 10
Times, 100 Times, or as many as the image specifies.

Cache operations screen
At any given time, your Blackberry uses a few cache mechanisms.
When you visit a site that uses cookies (think of a cookie as a piece
of text that a Web site created and placed in your BlackBerry’s
memory to remember something about you), Browser caches that
cookie. Browser also caches pages and content so that you can
view them offline — which is handy when you’re out of range. Also,
the addresses of the pages that you visited (or your latest 20 in
your History list) comprise a cache. Depending on the usage of
your browser, you might or might not see the Clear button(s)
shown in Figure 9-8.
Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave 129
Speeding up browsing
At times you may find that browsing the Web is extremely slow. You can make your
pages load faster in exchange for not using a few features. Here are some of the
techniques you can use:
 Don’t display images. You can see a big performance improvement by turning
off the display of images. From the Browser menu, select Browser Options, and
then select Browser Configuration. Scroll to Show Images, and change the
value to No.
 Make sure the Pearl is not low on memory or out of memory. When your
BlackBerry is very low in memory, its performance degrades. The BlackBerry
low-memory manager calls each application every now and then, telling each
one to free up resources.
Hint #1: Don’t leave many e-mail messages unread. When the low-memory man-
ager kicks in, Messages tries to delete old messages, but it can’t delete those
that are unread.
Hint #2: You can also clean up the BlackBerry event log to free up needed space.
Enter the letters LGLG while holding the Shift key. This displays an event log,
where you can clear events to free up memory.
 Turn off other features. If you’re mostly interested in viewing content, consider
turning off features that pertain to how the content is processed, such as
Support HTML Tables, Use Background Images, Support JavaScript, Allow
JavaScript Popups, and Support Style Sheets. To turn off other browser fea-
tures, go to Browser Options and select General Properties.
Warning: We don’t advise that you turn off features while performing an impor-
tant task such as online banking. If you do, you might not be able to perform
some of the actions on the page. For example, the Submit button might not work.

Figure 9-8: The Cache Operations options.
The size for each type of cache is displayed on this screen. If the
cache has content, you will also see the Clear button, which you can
use to clear the specified cache type. There are four types of cache:
 Content Cache: Any offline content you might have. You might
want to clear this out whenever you’re running out of space
on your BlackBerry and need to free some memory. Or maybe
when you’re tired of viewing old content or tired of pressing
the Refresh option.
 Push Content: Any content that was pushed to your
Blackberry from Push Services subscriptions. You might want
to clear this out to free some memory on your Blackberry.
 Cookie Cache: Any cookies stored on your BlackBerry. You
might want to clear this out for security’s sake. Sometimes
you don’t want a Web site to remember you.
 History: This is the list of sites you’ve visited using the Go To
function. You might want to clear this for the sake of security
if you don’t want other people knowing which Web sites
you’re visiting on your BlackBerry.

Calling Your Favorite Person
In This Chapter
 Accessing the BlackBerry Phone application
 Making calls and receiving them
 Managing your calls with call forwarding, and more
 Customizing your BlackBerry Phone setup
 Conferencing
 Talking hands-free on your BlackBerry phone
 Multitasking with your BlackBerry phone
P
hone capability has been incorporated into BlackBerry from
the very first generations of the device. The great news is that
the BlackBerry phone operates no differently than any other
phone you’ve used.
So why bother with this chapter? Although your BlackBerry phone
operates like any other phone you’ve used, it has capabilities that
far outreach those of your run-of-the-mill cellphone. For example,
when was the last time your phone was connected to your to-do
list? Have you ever received an e-mail and placed a call directly
from that e-mail? We didn’t think so. But with your BlackBerry
Pearl, you can do all these things and more.
In this chapter, we first cover phone basics and then show you
some of the neat ways BlackBerry Phone intertwines with other
BlackBerry applications and functions.
Using the BlackBerry 
Phone Application
Accessing the Phone application from the Pearl is a snap. From the
Home screen, pressing any of the numeric keys brings you right

into the BlackBerry Phone application. Or, if you prefer, you can
press the green Send button located right below the display screen
to get into the Phone application.
Making and Receiving Calls
The folks at RIM have created an intuitive user interface to all the
essential Phone features, including making and receiving calls.
Making a call
To make a call, start from the Home screen and type the number
you want to dial. As soon as you start typing numbers, the Phone
application opens. When you’ve finished typing the destination
number, press the green Send key.
Calling from the Address Book
Because you can’t possibly remember all your friends’ and col-
leagues’ phone numbers, calling from the Address Book is conven-
ient and useful.
To call from the Address Book, follow these steps:
1. Open the Phone application.
2. Press the Menu key.
The Phone menu appears, as shown in Figure 10-1.
Figure 10-1: The Phone menu.
3. Select Call from Address Book.
Address Book opens. From here, you can search as usual
for the contact you’d like to call.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
132

4. From Address Book, highlight your call recipient and
press the trackball to select Call.
This makes the call.
Dialing letters
One of the nice features of the BlackBerry Phone is that you can
dial letters, and BlackBerry will figure out the corresponding
number. For example, to dial 1-800-11-LEARN, do the following on
your BlackBerry:
1. From the Phone application (or the Home screen), dial
1-8-0-0-1-1.
As you type the first number, the Phone application opens
(if it isn’t open already) and displays the numbers you
dialed.
2. Press and hold the Alt key and then dial (press) 
L-E-A-R-N.
The letters appear onscreen as you type.
3. Press the green Send key.
This call is initiated.
Receiving a call
Receiving a call on your Pearl is even easier than making a call. You
can receive calls in a couple of ways. One is by using your Pearl’s
automated answering feature, and the other is by answering the
calls manually.
Automated answering is triggered whenever you take your
BlackBerry out from your holster; in other words, just taking the
BlackBerry out forces it to automatically pick up any call, so you
can start talking right away. The disadvantage of this is that you
don’t have time to see who is calling you (on your caller ID).
Note: To disable auto-answering, just be sure your BlackBerry isn’t
in its holster when an incoming call arrives.
What’s the advantage of disabling auto-answering? Well, manual
answering prompts you to answer a call or ignore a call when you
receive an incoming call, as shown in Figure 10-2. This way, you
can see on your caller ID who is calling you, before you decide to
pick up or ignore the call.
Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person 133

Figure 10-2: Ignore or answer with manual answering.
Phone Options While on a Call
When you’re on the phone, situations might arise where you’d
want to mute your conversation or change the call volume. No
problem. BlackBerry Pearl makes such adjustments easy.
Muting your call
You might want to use the mute feature while on a conference call
(see the upcoming section, “Arranging Conference Calls”) when you
don’t need to speak but do need to hear what is being discussed.
Maybe you’re on the bus or have kids in the background, making
your surroundings noisy. But by using mute, all the background
noises are filtered out from the conference call.
To mute your call. follow these steps:
1. While in a conversation, press the Menu key.
The Phone menu appears in all its glory.
2. Select Mute.
You will hear a tone sound, indicating that your call is 
on mute.
To un-mute your call:
1. While a call is on mute, press the Menu key.
The Phone menu makes another appearance.
2. Select Turn Mute Off.
You will hear a tone sound, indicating that your call is now
un-muted.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
134

Adjusting the call volume
Adjusting the call volume, a simple yet important action on your
BlackBerry phone, can be performed by simply pressing the
volume up or down key on the side of your Pearl.
Customizing the BlackBerry Phone
For your BlackBerry Phone to work the way you like, you have to
first set it up the way you want it. In this section, we go through some
settings that can make you the master of your BlackBerry Phone.
Setting up your voice mail number
This section shows you how to set up your voice mail access
number. Unfortunately, the instructions for setting up your voice
mailbox vary, depending on your service provider. Fortunately,
however, most service providers are more than happy to walk you
through the steps to get your mailbox set up in a jiffy.
To set up your voice mail number:
1. Open the Phone application, press the Menu key, and
select Options.
A list of phone options appears.
2. Select Voice Mail.
This opens the voice mail configuration screen.
3. Scroll to access the number field and enter your voice
mail access number.
4. Confirm your changes by pressing the Menu key and
selecting Save.
If this field is empty and you don’t know this number, con-
tact your service provider and ask for your voice mail
access number.
Using call forwarding
On the BlackBerry, you have two types of call forwarding:
 Forward All Calls: Any calls to your BlackBerry are for-
warded to the number you designate. Another name for this
feature is unconditional forwarding.
Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person 135

 Forward Unanswered Calls: Calls that meet different types of
conditions are forwarded to different numbers.
For the unanswered calls type of forwarding, three conditions
determine what number to forward to:
 If Busy: You don’t have call waiting turned on, and you’re on
the phone.
 If No Answer: You don’t hear your phone ring or somehow are
unable to pick up your phone (perhaps you’re in a meeting).
 If Unreachable: You’re out of network coverage and cannot
receive any signals.
Out of the box, your BlackBerry Pearl forwards any unanswered
calls, regardless of conditions, to your voice mail number by
default. However, you can add new numbers to forward a call to.
You need to be within network coverage before can you change your
call forwarding option. After you’re within network coverage, you
can change your call forwarding settings by doing the following:
1. Open the Phone application, press the Menu key, and
select Options.
A list of phone options appears.
2. Select Call Forwarding.
Your BlackBerry now attempts to connect with the server.
If successful, you’ll see the Call Forwarding screen.
If you don’t see the Call Forwarding screen, wait until you
have network coverage and try again.
3. From the Call Forwarding screen, press the Menu key
and select Edit Numbers.
A list of number(s) appears. If this is the first time you’re
setting call forwarding, most likely only your voice mail
number is on this list.
4. To add a new forwarding number, press the Menu key
and select New Number.
A pop-up menu appears, prompting you to enter the new
forwarding number.
5. In the pop-up window, enter the number you want to for-
ward to and then press the trackball.
The new number you entered now appears on the call for-
ward number list. You can add this new number to any call
forwarding types or conditions.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
136

6. Press the Escape key.
You are returned to the Call Forwarding screen.
7. Scroll to the If Unreachable field and press the trackball.
A drop-down menu appears listing numbers from the call
forwarding number list, including the one you just added.
8. Select the number you want to forward to and then press
the trackball.
Doing so places the selected number into the If Unreachable
field. You can see this on the call forwarding screen.
9. Confirm your changes by pressing the Menu key and
selecting Save.
Configuring speed dial
Speed dial is a convenient feature on any phone. And after you get
used to having it on a phone system, it’s hard not to use it on other
phones, including your BlackBerry phone.
Viewing your speed dial list
To view your speed dial list:
1. Open the Phone application.
2. Press the Menu key and select View Speed Dial List.
This displays a list of speed dial entries, as shown in 
Figure 10-3. If you haven’t set up any speed dials, this list
will be empty.
Adding a new number to speed dial
Setting up speed dial numbers is as easy as using them. It takes a
few seconds to set them up, but you benefit every time you use
this feature.
To assign a number to a speed dial slot, follow these steps:
1. Open the Phone application.
2. Press the Menu key, select Options, and then select View
Speed Dial List.
This brings up the list of speed dial numbers you have.
3. Scroll to an empty speed dial slot, press the Menu key,
and select New Speed Dial.
The BlackBerry Address Book appears so you can select a
contact’s phone number.
Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person 137

Figure 10-3: The speed dial list.
4. Select a contact, and then press the trackball.
The number appears in the speed dial list.
If more than one number is associated with the selected
contact in the Address Book, you’re prompted to select
which number to add to the speed dial list.
Using speed dial
After you have a few speed dial entries set up, you can start using
them. While at the Home screen or Phone application, press a
speed dial key. The call is initiated to the number associated with
that particular speed dial key.
Arranging Conference Calls
To have two or more people on the phone with you — the infa-
mous conference call — do the following:
1. Use the Phone application to place a call to the first 
participant.
2. While the first participant is on the phone with you,
press the Menu key and select New Call.
This automatically places the first call on hold and brings
up a new call screen, as shown in Figure 10-4, prompting
you to place another call.
3. Place a call to the second participant by dialing a
number, pressing the trackball, and then selecting Call.
You can either dial the number using the number pad, or
you can select a frequently dialed number from your call
log. To place a call from your Address Book, press the
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
138

trackball from the New Call screen and choose Call from
Address Book. Your BlackBerry then prompts you to select
a contact to dial to from the Address Book.
Figure 10-4: The New Call screen, with a meeting participant on hold.
This is just like any other phone call (except that the first
participant is still on the other line).
4. While the second participant is on the phone with you,
press the Menu key and select Join, as shown in 
Figure 10-5.
Figure 10-5: Join two people in a conference call.
This reconnects the first participant back with you, along
with the second participant. Now you can discuss away
with both participants at the same time.
Another name for having two people on the phone with you is
three-way calling, which is not a new concept. If you want to chat
with four people or even ten people on the phone at the same time,
you certainly can. Simply repeat Steps 2 through 4 in the preceding
list until you have all the participants on the phone conference.
Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person 139

Talking privately to a conference
participant
During a conference call, you might want to talk to one participant
privately. This is called splitting your conference call. Here’s how
you do it:
1. While on a conference call, press the Menu key and
select Split.
This brings up a pop-up screen, listing all the participants
of the conference call. (See Figure 10-6.)
Figure 10-6: All the participants in the conference call.
2. From the pop-up screen, select the participant with
whom you want to speak privately.
This action places all other participants on hold and con-
nects you to the participant that you selected. On the display
screen, you can see to whom you are connected — this con-
firms that you selected the right person to privately chat with.
3. To talk to all participants again, press the Menu key and
select Join.
Doing so brings you back to the conference call with 
everyone.
Alternate between phone 
conversations
Whether you’re in a private conversation during a conference call
or you’re talking to someone while you have someone else on hold,
you can switch between the two conversations by swapping them.
Follow these steps:
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
140

1. While talking to someone with another person on hold,
press the Menu key and select Swap.
Doing so switches you from the person with whom you’re
currently talking to the person who was on hold.
2. Repeat Step 1 to go back to the original conversation.
Dropping that meeting hugger
If you’ve been on conference calls, you can identify those chatty
“meeting huggers” who have to say something about everything.
Don’t you wish that you could drop them off the call? Well, with
your Pearl, you can (as long as you are the meeting moderator or
the person who initiates the call).
1. While on a conference call, press the Menu key and
select Drop Call.
This brings up a pop-up screen, listing all the participants
of the conference call.
2. From the pop-up screen, select the meeting hugger you
want to drop.
Doing so disconnects the meeting hugger.
3. Conversation can continue as usual.
Communicating Hands-Free
Because more and more places prohibit the use of mobile phones
without a hands-free headset, we thought we’d go through the
hands-free options you have on your BlackBerry.
Using the speaker phone
The Speaker Phone function is useful under certain situations,
such as when you’re in a room full of people who want to join in on
your phone conversation. Or, you might be all by your lonesome in
your office but are stuck rooting through your files — hard to do
with a BlackBerry scrunched up against your ear. (We call such
moments multitasking — a concept so important we devote an
entire upcoming section to it.)
To switch to the Speaker Phone while you’re on a phone call, press
the OP key or press the Menu key and select Activate Speaker Phone.
Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person 141

Pairing your BlackBerry with 
a Bluetooth headset
Since your BlackBerry comes with a wired hands-free headset, you
can start using it by simply plugging it into the headset jack on the
left side of your BlackBerry. You adjust the volume of the headset
using the volume keys (on the side of the Pearl).
Using the wired hands-free headset can help you avoid being a
police target, but if you’re multitasking on your BlackBerry, the
wired headset can get in the way and become inconvenient.
This is where the whole Bluetooth wireless thing comes in. You can
purchase a BlackBerry Bluetooth headset to go with your
Bluetooth-enabled BlackBerry. For a list of BlackBerry-compatible
Bluetooth headsets, see Chapter 16.
After you purchase a BlackBerry-compatible Bluetooth headset,
you can pair it with your BlackBerry. Think of pairing a Bluetooth
headset with your BlackBerry as registering the headset with your
BlackBerry so that it recognizes the headset.
First things first: You need to prep your headset for pairing. Now,
each headset manufacturer has a different take on this, so you’ll
need to consult your headset documentation for details. With that
out of the way, though, you’ll need to continue with the pairing.
Here’s how that’s done:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Bluetooth.
2. Press the Menu key to display the Bluetooth menu.
You see the Enable Bluetooth option. If you see the Disable
Bluetooth option instead, you can skip to Step 4.
3. From the menu, scroll to Enable Bluetooth and press the
trackball.
This enables Bluetooth on your BlackBerry.
4. Press the Menu key to display the Bluetooth menu and
select Add Device.
You see the Searching for Devices progress bar, um, progress-
ing, as shown in Figure 10-7 (left). When your BlackBerry
discovers the headset, a Select Device dialog box appears
with the name of the headset, as shown in Figure 10-7 (right).
5. From the Select Device dialog box, select the Bluetooth
headset.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
142

Figure 10-7: Searching for a headset (left). Success! A headset (right).
A dialog box appears to prompt you for a passkey code to
the headset.
6. Enter the passkey and press the trackball.
Normally, the passkey is 0000, but refer to your headset
documentation. After you successfully enter the passkey,
you see your headset listed in the Bluetooth setting screen.
7. Press the Menu key to display the Bluetooth menu and
select Connect.
Your BlackBerry now attempts to connect to the Bluetooth
headset.
8. When you see a screen like Figure 10-8, you can start
using your Bluetooth headset.
Figure 10-8: You can begin using your Bluetooth headset.
Using voice dialing
With your headset and the Voice Dialing application, you can truly
be hands-free from your Pearl. You might be thinking, “How do I
Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person 143

activate the Voice Dialing application without touching the Pearl?”
Good question. The majority of hands-free headsets (Bluetooth or
not) come with a multipurpose button.
After your headset is active, press its multipurpose button to acti-
vate the Voice Dialing application. You will be greeted with a voice
stating, “Say a command.” At this point, simply say “Call name of
person or number.” The Voice Dialing application is quite good in
recognizing the name of the person and the numbers you dictate.
We strongly suggest that you try the voice dialing feature before
you need it (for example, while driving).
Multitasking While on the Phone
One of the great things about the BlackBerry Pearl is that you can
use it for other tasks while you’re on the phone. For example, while
on a phone call, you can take notes or make a to-do list. Or you can
look up a phone number in BlackBerry Address Book that your caller
is asking you for. You can even compose an e-mail while on a call.
It only makes sense to multitask while you’re using a hands-free
headset or a speaker phone. Otherwise, your face would be stuck
to your BlackBerry, and you couldn’t engage in your conversation
and multitask at the same time.
After you have your hands-free headset on or a speaker phone
turned on, you can start multitasking by doing the following:
1. While in a conversation, from the Phone application,
press the Menu key and select Home Screen.
Alternatively, you can simply press the Esc button while in
the Phone application to return to your Home screen. This
returns you to the Home screen without terminating your
phone conversation.
2. From the Home screen, you can start multitasking.
Although you can compose e-mails during a phone conversation,
you can’t send the e-mail until you finish the phone conversation.
In addition, you can’t surf the Web while on the phone.
While on the phone and multitasking, however, you can still access
the Phone menu from other applications. For example, from your
to-do list, you can end a call or put a call on hold.

 Setting a picture as a caller ID or Home screen image
P
earl is the first BlackBerry with a built-in camera, and we bet
it’s one of the reasons you have one, right? So, hold your
breath as we go to the depths on how you can take advantage of
this great feature. This will be a fun chapter. Not only that, we’ll
walk you through the steps in capturing that funny pose. Plus, we’ll
also advance your knowledge on the tricks for taking the best
shots and show you how to store those shots and share them with
your buddies.
Say Cheese
Before you ask someone to pose, let’s examine your BlackBerry
first. Your finger is not blocking the lens, check (the lens is located
on the back side of your BlackBerry). The camera is active, check.
It’s not? You see the bottom key on the right side of your BlackBerry?
That’s the key to the kingdom; let’s call it the camera key. Press it
and you’ll see the camera screen appears. Alternatively, you can
open the camera by pressing the Menu key from the Home screen
and selecting Camera.
C’mon, try it! After the camera is active, you should see the image
in the screen that the camera is going to capture. Pressing the
camera key again will capture that image. Ready? Press the camera

key. You should hear a funky sound emulating the shutter of a 
regular camera. Neat and easy, isn’t it?
Hey, you can take a picture of yourself as well. Turn that BlackBerry
back and you should see a mirror right below the lens. Whatever
you see in that mirror is what the camera captures.
Itching to take more pictures? Hold your horses. Take a few
moments first to familiarize yourself with the camera’s features.
The Screen Indicators
When you open the Camera application, the first thing you see is the
screen shown in Figure 11-1. The top portion of this screen allows
you to see the image you’re about to capture. The bottom part con-
tains icons (starting from the left) that indicate the number of pic-
tures you can capture, focusing, and flash. Prepare to dissect.
Figure 11-1: The Camera screen ready to take pictures.
Choosing picture quality
Your camera is capable of capturing up to 1.3 megapixels of resolu-
tion. You probably don’t need this much resolution because it also
requires a bigger space to save your image. So, your BlackBerry
allows you to set three picture qualities: namely Normal, Fine, and
Number of pictures
that can be saved
Zoom direction
Zoom amount
Image to capture
Flash
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
146

SuperFine. The default setting is Normal, which is the lowest quality
but gives you the largest number of pictures you can save — 200.
The tradeoff of using Normal is that it may not be as smooth or fine
compared to the Fine and SuperFine settings. You should choose a
setting based on how you plan to use the picture. If you’re taking a
shot of a breathtaking landscape in which you want to capture every
possible detail and print it later, you’ll want the SuperFine setting.
On the other hand, if you’re just taking pictures of your friends’
faces so you can attach them as Caller ID, Normal is appropriate.
Changing picture quality is a snap. Here’s how:
1. Open the Camera application.
From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Camera.
2. Press the Menu key and select Options.
3. Highlight Picture Quality and press the SPACE key.
Pressing the SPACE key toggles the picture quality value
between Normal, Fine, and SuperFine. You may have to
press the SPACE key twice to select the setting you want.
4. Press the Menu key and select Save.
The picture quality you’ve chosen is now active.
Zooming and focusing
Focus! We mean your camera. You need to be steady to get a good
focus while taking the shots. Although it’s convenient to use one
hand while taking pictures, you would soon discover that most of
the time you’ll get a blurry image. Our advice is to use both hands,
one holding the BlackBerry steady and the other clicking the button.
This is even more important if you’re zooming in. Yes, your camera
is capable of up to 5x digital zoom. Use the trackball for this; scroll-
ing up zooms in and scrolling down zooms out. While using the
zoom, the value in the indicator changes from 1x, 2x, up to 5x and
vice versa, depending on the direction of your scroll.
When zooming, your thumb is already on the trackball. What a
convenient way to take the picture — just press.
Setting the flash
The rightmost indicator on the Camera screen is the flash. The
default is Automatic, which shows an arrow with the letter A. 
Chapter 11: Taking Great Pictures with Your Pearl 147

Automatic means it detects the amount of light you have at the
moment you capture the image. Where it’s dark, the flash fires; oth-
erwise it will not. You can also turn it ON or OFF. When set to OFF,
the arrow image is encircled with a diagonal line, just like you see on
the Don’t Walk traffic signal. You can toggle the settings in
Camera’s Options screen, which is accessible by pressing the
Menu key.
Working with Pictures
You’ve amassed pictures and you want to view, delete, or perhaps
organize them. No problem.
Viewing
Viewing a picture is one of the common functions you’re going to
do in your camera. And it’s also one of the default behaviors. After
taking a picture, right then and there, the screen changes to view
mode, allowing you to see the image you just captured, as shown
in Figure 11-2. If you happened to be browsing through your pic-
ture folders, you can view an individual picture by highlighting it
and pressing the trackball.
Slide show
While viewing the list of pictures in a folder, press the Menu key
and select Slide Show. Voila! Your BlackBerry displays your pic-
tures one at a time at a regular time interval. The default interval
between each picture is 2 seconds; if you’re not happy with this
interval, change it in the Options screen. Again, the Options screen
is available by pressing the Menu key and selecting Options.
Trashing
If you don’t like the image you captured, you can delete it. Just
highlight the picture you want trashed and press the DEL key, then
select Delete from the confirmation screen that follows. Note that
you can do the same right after taking the picture; just click the
trash can icon (refer to Figure 11-2).

Figure 11-2: The Camera screen after taking a picture.
Listing
The default setting when you open a folder packed with pictures is
a listing of thumbnails, which are a small previews of your pictures.
Preview is nice, but if you’re trying to search for a picture file and
know the file name, wouldn’t it be nice if you just saw the listing of
names instead of the thumbnails? While you’re in a folder, press
the trackball and select View List. That’s exactly what you get: a
listing of all the pictures in this folder. What’s neat is that it also
displays the size of the file.
Picture properties
Curious about the amount of memory your picture is taking? Or
maybe you just want to know the time you took it. While highlight-
ing the picture from a list or viewing it, press the Menu key and
select Properties. What you’ll see next is a screen similar to Figure
11-3. This screen displays the location of your picture, the size of
the file, and when it was last modified.

Organizing your pictures
You might be interested in putting some order into where your pic-
tures are stored and how they are named. Organization is all about
time and the best use of it. After all, you want to enjoy looking at
your pictures — not looking for them. BlackBerry enables you to
rename and move pictures to different folders. Plus, you can create
folders too. With those capabilities, you should be on your way to
organization nirvana.
Renaming a picture
While capturing a picture, the image is actually saved in your
BlackBerry. However, the name is a bit generic, something like
IMG000x. You should make a habit to rename it as soon as you’ve
finished capturing it. It is easier to recognize Dean blows birthday
candles than IMG0029. Renaming is a snap. Here’s how:
1. While the picture is viewed on the screen or highlighted
in the list, press the Menu key and select Rename.
A Rename screen appears, as shown in Figure 11-4.
2. Enter the name you want for this picture and then 
select OK.
Your picture has been renamed.
Creating a new folder
Being the organized person you are, you must be wondering about
the folders we mentioned. Don’t fret, it’s quite simple to create
one. Here’s how:
1. In the Camera screen, press the Menu key and select
View Pictures.
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
150

The screen displays the list of pictures in the current folder
and an Up icon for you to navigate up to the folder above
this folder.
Figure 11-4: Rename your picture here.
2. Select the Up icon to navigate to the main folder in which
you want your new folder to be created.
You should be within the folder where you want your new
folder to be created. If not, repeat this step and use your
trackball to navigate to that folder.
3. Press the Menu key and select New Folder.
4. Enter the name of the folder and select OK.
Your folder is created.
Moving pictures
There are many reasons for moving pictures between folders and
one of them is the obvious: organization. Want to try it? Follow
these steps:
1. In the Camera screen, press the Menu key and select
View Pictures.
The screen displays the list of pictures in the current
folder. If the picture you want to move is not in this folder,
click the Up icon to navigate up to other folders.
2. Highlight the picture you want to move, press the Menu
key, and select Move.
The screen that follows allows you to navigate to the folder
where you want to move this picture.
3. Click the Up icon and use the trackball to navigate to the
folder where you want to move this picture.
Chapter 11: Taking Great Pictures with Your Pearl 151

4. Press the Menu key and select Move Here.
Your picture is moved.
Sharing your pictures
There’s no joy in taking great pictures if you’re the only one seeing
them, right? Your BlackBerry Pearl has a couple of options for
sharing your bundle of joy. Highlight one of those pictures, and
then press the Menu key. You should see the following options:
 Send As Email: This option goes directly to the compose
e-mail screen, with the currently selected picture as an 
attachment.
 Send to Messenger Contact: This option displays a screen
with a list of your BlackBerry Messenger contacts. This allows
you to choose the contact to whom you want to send the
selected picture.
 Send As MMS: Similar to Send As Email, this opens a compose
MMS screen with the currently selected picture as an attach-
ment. The only difference is that it will first display the
Address Book, letting you select the person’s phone number
to receive the MMS before proceeding to the compose screen.
 Send Using Bluetooth: This will allow you to send the picture
to any device that is capable of communicating through
Bluetooth. See Chapter 10 for details on how to enable and
pair Bluetooth devices.
Setting a picture as the caller ID
Wouldn’t it be nice if when you received a call from someone, his
or her picture appeared on the screen? Yup, you can do that. If you
have the face of your buddy inside your BlackBerry, view it (see
the previous section on viewing pictures), press the Menu key, and
select Set as Caller ID. (If you don’t have pictures of your friends,
now is the time to show off your gem and start clicking.)
Setting a Home screen image
Suppose you have a stunning picture that you want to use as the
background image of your BlackBerry. Just view the picture (see
the previous discussion on viewing pictures), press the Menu key,
and select Set As Home Screen Image. You can always reset the
home screen image by going back to the same menu screen and
selecting Reset Home Screen Image.

Other Important Camera Options
The camera in your BlackBerry is a piece of hardware and a com-
puter program. It is therefore within the bounds of your
BlackBerry’s available memory. As such, the good people at RIM
incorporated some parameters that you can set so that you’ll
enjoy the use of your camera fully and, at the same time, not affect
other important features that share the same memory resource.
Following are two important option settings you need to know:
 Device Memory Limit: The amount of device memory your
camera can use. The values are 12M, 15M, 20M, and 25M (1M
is 1000K). To get a feel for how many pictures this is, look at
the properties of an existing picture and note its file size.
 Reserved Pictures Memory: The amount of memory
BlackBerry reserves for the camera to store pictures. Possible
values are 0M, 2M, 5M, 8M, 10M, and 12M. This value can’t be
set greater than the Device Memory Limit.
If you open the Camera application and see “Could not start the
camera. Close other applications and try opening the camera
again” message, it means your BlackBerry is running out of
memory for the camera to run smoothly. One solution is to follow
what the message says. Press the Shift and the Escape keys at the
same time and a list of applications appears. (The Escape key is to
the right of the trackball and has the curving arrow symbol.) Go
through these applications and close them. If this doesn’t work,
the all-reliable reset (taking the battery out and putting it back in)
is your ultimate solution.

with the Media Player
In This Chapter
 Listening and viewing media
 Importing your PC media collections
 Downloading media
I
f there is a word to describe today’s phone market trends, it’s
convergence. Your BlackBerry Pearl is one of the latest partici-
pants of this convergence race. We probably don’t have to tell you
this, but in addition to being a phone, e-mail, camera, and PDA
device, your Pearl is a portable media player. In the palm of your
hand, you will be able to listen to music, watch video clips, sample
ringtones, and view pictures. These are all bundled into an applica-
tion with a name you would recognize even after consuming a
couple of pints of strong ale – Media. This chapter is all about
Media and how you can take advantage of its capabilities.
Accessing Media
To run Media, simply press the Menu key from the Home screen
and select Media. Or if you have it chosen as one of the five appli-
cations you display in the Home screen, you can select it directly
by clicking its icon.
Media is a collection of media types: Music, Video, Ringtones, and
Pictures, as shown in Figure 12-1. You don’t need to be Einstein to
figure out what each one of these media types is for. Ready to have
some fun?

Figure 12-1: Explore Media here.
Folder navigation
Whether you want to play music, watch a video clip, test a ring-
tone, or view pictures from your BlackBerry, you have to navigate
to the location of your media files. Media files are stored in three
types of memory locations, namely Media Card, Device Memory,
and Preloaded Media. You have the option to read and write to 
the Media Card and the Device Memory locations. However, the
Preloaded Media location can be only read and not written. All we
care about is how to navigate and find your media files.
These memory locations are organized in folders, as shown in
Figure 12-2. To navigate inside, simply select the folder. A folder
may contain subfolders, so you can keep opening down until you
find the files you want. To move up the folder hierarchy, select Up.
Figure 12-2: The folders to media files, with thumbnails view (left) and 
list view (right).

Let the music play
To play music in your BlackBerry Pearl, you don’t need a quarter.
Just select Music from Media screen and a folder structure similar
to the one shown on the right in Figure 12-2 appears, with Music as
the heading of the screen instead of Pictures. Navigate through this
folder structure to find the music file you want.
After you find the file, simply select it and it will begin playing, with
a screen as shown in Figure 12-3. BlackBerry Pearl supports many
music formats (with file extensions) including:
 ACC: Audio compression formats AAC, AAC+, and EAAC+
(.aac, .m4a)
 AMR: Adaptive Multi Rate-Narrow Band (AMR-NB) speech
coder standard (.mmr, .3gp)
 MIDI: Polyphonic MIDI (.mid, .midi, .smf)
 WAV: Wave files (.wav)
 MP3: MPEG Part 1 and Part 2 audio layer 3 (.mp3, .mp4)

Selecting each file to play sometimes could be a hassle — and not
even a sensible thing to do if you’re in a gym or jogging. Fret not.
You would have asked for this feature in the first place, so RIM
added an option for you to play all songs within a folder or even 
all subfolders. While you are in a folder, press the Menu key and
select Play All to play every song in the current folder and all sub-
folders, or select Play Folder to play songs in the current folder.
Note that there is no fast forwarding or rewinding.
The earpiece combo mike that comes with BlackBerry Pearl is only
for one ear. This might be an issue when you are in a noisy area. To
improve your experience, you can buy a stereo headset. And, yes,
a Bluetooth headset is a good option.

Making your video files play in Pearl
When you try playing an existing video file in your BlackBerry Pearl, the likelihood
that it will fail playing is high. The common reason is that most video files are
encoded to play on a bigger screen. Not to worry. With the help of your PC and
something called an encoder, you can easily convert these files into a format that’s
friendly to your Pearl. You can download many types of encoders from the Web. We
found Super, a free encoder that does a decent job and supports many file types.
Here’s the link to download Super:
http://www.blackberryfordummies.com/pearl/super.html
After you’ve downloaded and installed Super onto your PC, you’re ready to convert
your video files. Launch Super. The screen that follows might be a bit intimidating,
but relax. Without going into too much detail on the numbers and fields, we’ll give
you quick settings to use:

Output Container: avi

Output Video Codec: H.263

Aspect: 11.9

Frame/Sec: 14.985

Bitrate kbps: 576
Leave the default values for the rest of the fields. Next, you need to tell Super the
location of the file you want to encode and where you want the output file. You can
do this by right-clicking anywhere on the Super screen, selecting Add Multimedia
File(s), and navigating to your video file. Then right-click again, select Specify the
Output Folder Destination, and navigate to that folder. Then click Encode (Active
Job-List Files). That’s it! Super encodes the file, and makes it smaller. Now you can
copy this file to your media card and enjoy watching it from your BlackBerry Pearl.

Now showing
To play video clips, the general steps are no different than playing
music files. Just select Video from Media screen and again a screen
similar to Figure 12-2 appears, but with Video as the heading instead
of Pictures. Navigate to the video file you want, select it, and a con-
tender to the funniest home video is playing. Video formats sup-
ported are .avi, .mov, .mp4, and .3gp. Start collecting now.
Similar to Music, if you press the Menu key in one of the folders
containing video files, you can select Play All to play every video
file in the current folder and all its subfolders, or select Play Folder
to play every video file in only the current folder.
Note that there is no fast forwarding or rewinding.
Lord of the ringtones
Ah, the proliferation of ringtones; that’s history. Nothing beats hear-
ing a loud funky ringtone while you’re sleeping on a bus or a train.
Whether you want a real Matchbox Twenty’s “3 A.M.” song or the
old-fashioned digital repercussions or anything that would annoy
the guy sitting next to you, you have that flexibility. Give a toast to
BlackBerry Pearl. Of course you want to hear ringtones that come
with your BlackBerry Pearl. And, there’s a bunch, so enjoy.
Simply select Ringtones from the Media screen. What you see next
is the same navigation screen that Music and Video use (refer to
Figure 12-2). Again, your BlackBerry Pearl comes with a decent
selection of ringtones, stored in Preloaded Media. You can select
this folder or a folder where you’ve stored any ringtones you’ve
acquired. After you are in a folder showing a list of ringtones,
select one from the list and it will start playing. You can also play
all the ringtones in the folder by pressing the Menu key and select-
ing either Play Folder or Play All, which is the same as Play Folder
but includes all the ringtones in the subfolders.
If you find a ringtone you like, you can make it the default ring by
highlighting it, pressing the Menu key, and selecting Set As Phone
Tune. A ringtone is similar to a music file and includes the follow-
ing music formats: .aac, .mmr, .m4a, .midi, .mp3.
Picture this
Folks who upgraded from an older BlackBerry may know Picture.
It’s one of the intuitive applications RIM kept in BlackBerry Pearl
Chapter 12: Satisfy All Your Senses with the Media Player 159

but made better. Picture, as the name implies, allows you to view
images, with zoom and rotate capabilities.
Select Picture from Media screen and what you see next is the
familiar folder structure. Navigate to the folder structure where
your pictures are stored. After you find the picture file, just select
it. Easy does it, right?
Check out Preloaded Media. Your BlackBerry Pearl comes with
nice pictures you can use as the background image of the Home
screen. There are also some cartoon images that you can tem-
porarily assign to your contacts as caller IDs until you get a chance
to take their pictures.
Zoom to details
Is that a pimple? No, it’s not. Let’s zoom in. While viewing an image,
press the trackball and select Zoom. A tiny nonobtrusive slider 
bar appears on the left side of the image. Now, use your trackball:
scrolling up will zoom in and scrolling down will zoom out. While
scrolling, the slider bar indicates the degree of zoom. The exact
center of this bar is the original image (no zooming applied). You
can easily go back to the original zoom size by pressing the Menu
key and selecting Zoom All.
Rotate it
Want to view yourself upside down? Not really. But sometimes
your pictures may be best viewed sideways or you’re just so bored
that you like to exercise your neck. While you’re viewing an image
in Picture, press the trackball and select Rotate. The image rotates
90 degrees clockwise. You can keep rotating the image by repeating
the steps of pressing the trackball and selecting Rotate; each time
you get an additional 90-degree clockwise rotation.
Turn it down or blast it off
Whether you’re listening to music or watching a video, adjusting
the volume is easy because your BlackBerry Pearl comes with ded-
icated volume keys. They’re located on the top right side of the
device. The top key (with the plus sign) turns the volume up, and
the one below it (with the minus sign) turns the volume down.
Commonly used navigation
Whether you’re viewing a picture, listening to music, or watching a
video clip, you can easily jump forward or backward to the next
Part III: Getting Multimedia and Going Online with Your Pearl 
160

item in the list. Press the Menu key while viewing a picture and you
should see the following menu items:
 Next: Jumps to the next item in the list. This item appears
only if there’s an item next to this media file in the current
folder.
 Previous: Jumps to the previous item. This item appears only
if there’s a previous item in the current folder.
 Delete: Deletes the media file.
 Move: Moves the file to a different folder.
 Rename: Renames the media file.
 Properties: Displays a screen showing the location of the
media file, its size, and the time it was last modified.
Working with Media Files
Are you always on top of the new gizmo trends? Nowadays, meth-
ods of acquiring media files are evolving. Ten years back, who
would think that we’d be buying music on a tiny SD card from Best
Buy or downloading music from an “all you can” type monthly 
subscription.
Sure, technologies are exciting, but most of us are happy maintain-
ing a music collection in one form or another, be it CDs or a digital
Chapter 12: Satisfy All Your Senses with the Media Player 161
Media shortcuts
It’s all about saving your valuable time. Taking the time to master these shortcuts
now will pay you back in time later. Here are the must-know Media shortcuts:

Mute key: Toggles between pausing and playing of music and video

6: Moves to the next item

4: Moves to the previous item

3: Zooms in on a picture

9: Zooms out on a picture

5: Zooms back to the original picture size

, (comma): Rotates a picture counterclockwise

SPACE key: Toggles between pausing and resuming a slide show

format in our computer. Someday, we’ll wake up with a technology
that doesn’t require us to deal with constantly copying media files
from this collection to our handheld music players. But for now,
enjoying music while on the move means managing these files. Media
is a great music player, but without music files it’s as useless as a
guitar without strings. Enough with chitchat, let’s get on with it.
Importing your media collection
First and foremost, you need to have a media collection in a digital
format. In fact we’ll just assume that you have that already. (A
quick Web browsing on the topic of music burning will get your
feet wet.) You can easily transfer that collection of media files to
your BlackBerry Pearl. But wait a second; we have this topic cov-
ered in detail in Chapter 13, so check it out there.
Synchronizing with iTunes
If you have an iPod, it’s likely that you are using iTunes and maintain-
ing a playlist and perhaps a subscription to podcasts. Would you like
to sync your BlackBerry with iTunes? Well, don’t we all. Unfortu-
nately, this is not done out of the box. After all, iTunes is not a 
RIM product. However, you can buy software called PearlTunes
(http://pocketmac.net) for only $9.95, as of this writing.
Sharing media files using Bluetooth
We love sharing, especially if we’re on the receiving end, right? 
You can send your media files to any Bluetooth-capable device.
Here’s how:
1. From the Media screen, select the media type.
2. Select a media folder.
You may have to drill down to the folder to find the media
file you’re looking for.
3. Press the Menu key and select Send Using Bluetooth.
At this point, Bluetooth displays all the paired Bluetooth
devices. (Refer to Chapter 10 for more on Bluetooth
enabling and pairing devices.)
4. Select the Bluetooth-enabled device.
5. Select Send.
BlackBerry starts sending the file.

Downloading tunes
RIM has set up a Web site where you can download new ringtones.
Simply point the Browser to the following and you’ll get a screen
similar to the one shown in Figure 12-4:
http://mobile.blackberry.com/mss/ringtone_catalog
From this page, you can sample and download alarms, notifiers,
and tunes. And did we mention that it’s free?
Figure 12-4: Download media files here.
Just select the tone you want from the three categories and it will
begin playing. After the tune plays, you can save it by pressing the
Menu key and selecting Save. RIM isn’t the only site where you can
find ringtones. The Web is a wonderful place, so go hunting.

 Using manual and automatic synchronization
W
hat better way to keep your BlackBerry Pearl updated 
than to synchronize it with your desktop application’s
data? Arguably, most of the data you need to synchronize is from
your PIM (personal information manager) applications. PIM info
includes notes, appointments, addresses, and tasks. The crucial
piece for data synchronization to and from your device and 
desktop computer is the Synchronize software. Synchronize is a 
product of Puma Technologies, licensed by RIM to work inside
BlackBerry Desktop Manager. This software allows you to synch-
ronize your PIM data. But that’s not all; it also lets you upload and
download media files between your PC and Pearl.
In this chapter, we introduce Synchronize and show you 
how to manually and automatically synchronize your Pearl 
with your desktop computer. We also offer tips on which data 
synchronization options you might want to use. Before we get 
into all that, however, we include a section on the BlackBerry
Desktop Manager.

Introduction to BlackBerry
Desktop Manager
The centerpiece of the desktop activities you can do for your
BlackBerry is the BlackBerry Desktop Manager (BDM), which is 
a suite of programs that include
 Application Loader: Installs BlackBerry applications and
updates the BlackBerry OS (not covered in this book).
 Backup and Restore: Backs up your BlackBerry data and 
settings. Check Chapter 14 for details.
 Synchronize: Synchronizes your BlackBerry data to your PC
(the topic of this chapter).
 Media Manager: Uploads media files on to your BlackBerry
from your PC and vice versa (the topic of this chapter).
BDM is the software included on the CD that comes with your
handheld device. Your BlackBerry’s packaging provides instruc-
tions on how to install BDM on your desktop computer.
Launching BDM
In most Windows installations, you find the shortcut to launch
BDM through the Start menu of your computer; choose Start➪
All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager. Connect your
BlackBerry to your desktop computer using the USB cable that
came with your device and then launch BDM. The BDM opening
screen appears (see Figure 13-1).
Figure 13-1: The BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager.
Notice the number of icons on this screen. Each icon is an applica-
tion by itself. Because BDM is a separate application, its installa-
tion might vary depending on the phone provider. At the very
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
168

least, you should have at least three icons or three applications:
Application Loader, Backup and Restore (Chapter 14), and
Synchronize.
Connecting BDM to your Pearl
You establish a connection between your BlackBerry Pearl and 
the BDM through the USB cable that comes with your device. Plug
in your device to your desktop. After BDM is running, it will try to
find a BlackBerry on the type of connection specified. The default
connection is USB, so it should work without your needing to con-
figure anything.
If your device has a password, enter it at the prompt. You should
then see Connected as the heading of the screen. If you see
Disconnected and no password prompt, either BDM can’t find the
device being connected via USB or the connection setting is not set
to use USB.
To make sure that the connection setting uses USB, do the following.
From the BDM screen, choose Options➪Connection Settings. The
screen shown in Figure 13-2 appears. In the Connection drop-down
list, select the USB connection that has the PIN of your BlackBerry.
Figure 13-2: Possible connection types 
to your BlackBerry.
Setting Up Synchronize
Synchronize is the part of BDM that allows you to synchronize
your data between your desktop computer and your Pearl. To
launch Synchronize, simply double-click the Synchronize icon. A
screen appears containing two tabs, as shown in Figure 13-3.
Chapter 13: Synching the Synchronize Way 169

Figure 13-3: The Synchronize tab (left) and the Configuration tab (right).
The Synchronize tab allows you to manually trigger synchroniza-
tion, and the Configure tab is where you can set up the configura-
tion and rules for reconciling data. The first thing you need to
figure out is the Configuration tab.
Configuring PIM synchronization
One important item in the Configuration tab is the Configure Synch
button, where you can configure PIM (personal information man-
ager) synchronization. PIM info includes notes, appointments,
addresses, and tasks. Clicking the Configure Synch button displays
the screen shown in Figure 13-4.
Figure 13-4: Configuring PIM info.
This screen is the entry point of the entire synchronization config-
uration for applications that are part of PIM. As you can see in
Figure 13-4, the PIM handheld application is paired with a desktop
application. This figure shows Outlook as the desktop application.
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
170

If you’re curious as to what other applications the PIM Configura-
tion option supports, click the Choose button. A screen similar to
Figure 13-5 appears, which lists other possible applications. The
list depends on the context of the highlighted PIM application.
These other desktop applications are also popular; you’re likely
using one of them. Isn’t it nice to know that you don’t have to
dump the application you’re already familiar with?

Synchronize supports for Address

task, and not many people perform it on a regular basis. If you’re
one of those folks, you won’t have any clue what changes to expect
on either side. Well, not to worry. You can tell Synchronize to
prompt you for any changes it’s trying to do or perhaps undo on
either side of the wire. This is where the Advanced Settings screen
comes in. To get to this view, follow these steps:
1. From BDM, double-click Synchronize.
2. From the Configuration screen that appears, click the
Configure Synch button.
The PIM configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 13-4).
At this point, Address Book is highlighted, so the next step
is based on the Address Book application. If you want to go
to the Confirmation tab of a PIM application other than
Address Book, you have to click that application from the
list at this point.
3. Click the Configure button.
Chapter 13: Synching the Synchronize Way 171

4. Choose Advanced Settings from the drop-down list.
The Advanced Settings for Address Book screen appears,
as shown in Figure 13-6. Note the Confirmation tab.
Figure 13-6: The Advanced Settings screen.
5. If the Confirmation tab is not active, click it.
You have the following options: You can display a prompt
screen to confirm deletions, you can display a prompt
screen to confirm updates and additions, or you can select
both options.
6. Click the options you want, and then click OK to save 
the settings.
Regardless of whether you select the first option,
Synchronize displays a prompt to confirm the deletion 
of all records.
Resolving update conflicts
If you don’t synchronize your device frequently, you will get into 
a situation where you must make an update to a particular record
on your BlackBerry as well as on your desktop application.
Synchronize needs to know how you want this handled. The inter-
face to define how to resolve these conflicts is the same for all PIM
applications. Again, for illustration, we’ll use the Address Book:
1. From BDM, double-click Synchronize.
2. From the Configuration screen that appears, click the
Configure Synch button.
The PIM configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 13-4).
3. Click the Configure button.
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
172

4. From the drop-down list that appears, choose Advanced
Settings.
The Advanced Settings for Address Book screen appears
(refer to Figure 13-6).
5. Click the Conflict Resolution tab.
The Conflict Resolution tab comes into view, as shown in
Figure 13-7.
Figure 13-7: Manage conflicts here.
You can tell Synchronize to handle conflicts in several
ways. Here are the options shown in the Address Book
Advanced Setting screen:
• Add All Conflicting Items: When a conflict happens,
add a new record to the BlackBerry for the changes
done on the desktop, and add a new record to the
desktop side for the changes done on the BlackBerry.
• Ignore All Conflicting Items: Ignore the fact that there
has been a change to the record and keep the data
the same on both sides.
• Notify Me When Conflicts Occur: This is the safest
among the options. Synchronize displays a message
screen with the details of the record that has a con-
flict and gives you the ability to resolve the conflict.
• Handheld Wins: Unless you are sure that this is the
case, you shouldn’t choose this option. It basically
tells Synchronize to disregard the changes done in
the desktop application and use handheld changes
every time it encounters a conflict.
• Application Wins: The name of this option changes
based on the application you’re using. It’s the 
opposite of the Handheld Wins option in that it 
tells Synchronize to always discard changes on the
Chapter 13: Synching the Synchronize Way 173

handheld and use the desktop application change
whenever it encounters a conflict. Again, we don’t
recommend this option because there’s no telling 
on which side you made the good update.
6. Click the option you want and then click OK to save 
the settings.
Ready, Set, Synchronize!
Are you ready to synchronize? Good. It’s now time to be brave and
push the button. Your two choices are manually (by using the
Synchronize Now button) or automatically.
Synchronize Now
Synchronize Now is a feature of Synchronize that enables you to
run the synchronization manually. The basic rundown is that you
choose the data you want to synchronize and click the Synchronize
Now button. That’s it. Without delay, here are the steps:
1. From BDM, double-click Synchronize.
The Synchronize screen appears (refer to the left screen 
in Figure 13-3). The four upper check boxes give you the
option to selectively synchronize your data. You can
choose from organizer data (such as calendar and Address
Book), add-in, and date and time.
Usually you have to make sure the Execute Add-in Action
option is selected to sync with third-party applications. If
you don’t have a third-party application installed for your
BlackBerry Pearl, you don’t have to worry about this.
2. Select the check boxes of the data you want to synchronize.
If you have automatic synchronization turned on (see the
next section), the items you check here are automatically
synched every time you connect your BlackBerry Pearl to
your PC.
3. Click the Synchronize Now button.
Synchronize starts running the synchronization; you see a
progress screen. If you set up rules to prompt for conflicts
and if Synchronize encounters one, you see a screen to
resolve it. After synchronization is finished, the progress
screen disappears, and the Synchronize screen returns.
4. Close Synchronize by clicking the Close button.
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
174

Automatic synchronization
How many times do you think you reconfigure your Synchronize
setup? Rarely, right? After you have it configured, that’s it. 
Yes, maybe once in a while you’ll find a reason to change some-
thing, but it’s mostly static. And if you’re like us, the reason you
open BlackBerry Desktop Manager is because you want to run
Synchronize. So, opening Synchronize and clicking the Synchronize
Now button is annoying.
If you’d like to make Synchronize run automatically every time you
connect your BlackBerry Pearl to your PC, simply select the last
check box in the Synchronize tab (Synchronize the Items Selected).
You might be asking, “What items will the auto-synchronization
synch?” Good question. It will auto-synch the items you’ve
checked in the top portion of the Synchronization tab. Simple.
(Refer to the left screen in Figure 13-3 for the Synchronization tab.)
Managing Your Media 
on Your Pearl
With the BlackBerry Desktop Manager (BDM), you can transfer
media files between your Pearl and your PC. It’s quite simple.
Media Manager allows you to transfer files only to your Pearl’s
internal memory, not to the memory in your microSD card. (A
microSD card allows you to store more files on your BlackBerry
Pearl. See Chapter 16 for where you can purchase one.)
If you want to carry a few pictures of your loved on your Pearl, you
can simply do the following:
1. Use a USB cable to connect your Pearl to your PC.
2. From BDM, double-click Media Manager.
The Media Manager screen appears, as shown in Figure
13-8. The left side of the screen shows files on your PC, and
the right side of the screen shows files on your Pearl.
3. On the left side of the screen, highlight the files you want
to transfer from your PC.
We assume that you know where to look for the files that
you want to transfer.
Chapter 13: Synching the Synchronize Way 175

Figure 13-8: The Media Manager screen.
4. On the right side of the screen, select the destination
folder where you want your files to be stored on your
BlackBerry Pearl.
5. Click the right arrow.
The right arrow transfers files from your PC to your Pearl.
Make sure that the files you’re transferring are small enough to fit
into your Pearl’s internal memory. You can check how much free
memory you have on the right side of the Media Manager screen.
To transfer files to your PC from your Pearl, click the left arrow
instead of the right arrow in Step 5.

 Restoring from backups
 Selectively backing up information
I
magine that you left your BlackBerry Pearl in the back of a cab
or on the train. You’ve lost your Pearl for good. Okay, not good.
So what happens to all your information? Have you lost it forever?
What about information security? Can anyone have unauthorized
access to your personal information?
One thing that you don’t need to worry about is information 
security — assuming that you set up a security password on 
your BlackBerry. With security password protection, anyone who
finds your BlackBerry has only ten chances to enter the correct
password; after those ten chances are up, it’s self-destruction 
time. Although it’s not as smoky and dramatic as what you see on
Mission Impossible, your BlackBerry does erase all its information
in such a scenario, thwarting your would-be data thief. Therefore,
set up a password for your BlackBerry! For information on how to
do so, refer to Chapter 3.
What you do need to worry about is how to get back all your infor-
mation on your BlackBerry Pearl. If you’re like us and you store
important information on your Pearl, this chapter is for you. Vital
information such as clients’ and friends’ contact information, notes
from phone calls with clients — and, of course, those precious e-mail
messages — should not be taken lightly. Backing up this information
is a reliable way to protect information from being lost forever.
In this chapter, we show you how you can prevent losing informa-
tion on your BlackBerry by backing that information up on your
PC. Then we show you how to restore and recover the information
you’ve backed up.

Accessing Backup and Restore
Backup and Restore is a mini-application within the BlackBerry
Desktop Manager (BDM). For instructions on installing BDM, see
Chapter 13. After BlackBerry Desktop Manager is installed on your
PC, you can connect your BlackBerry to your PC by using the USB
cable that comes with your BlackBerry. If everything is set up
properly, you see a pop-up window on your PC prompting you 
to type your BlackBerry security password. After you enter your
correct password, the BlackBerry is connected to the PC.
To access Backup and Restore, double-click the Backup and
Restore icon on the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen. Doing so
opens the Backup and Restore screen (see Figure 14-1). From this
point, you’re ready to back up or restore information from or to
your BlackBerry.
Figure 14-1: The Backup and Restore 
screen.
Backing Up BlackBerry Style
We all know that backing up your data provides tremendous peace
of mind when protecting your data. So do the folks at RIM, which is
why they made backing up your information quite easy. Your Pearl
can be backed up manually or by autopilot.
Backing up your BlackBerry 
manually
To back up your BlackBerry manually:
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
178

1. From the BDM screen, double-click the Backup and
Restore icon.
The Back and Restore screen appears (refer to Figure 14-1).
2. Click the Backup button.
The dialog box shown in Figure 14-2 appears, so you can
name the backup file and determine where you want it
saved on your PC.
Figure 14-2: Set where to save your backup file.
3. Name your backup file, choose a place to save it, and
then click Save.
BlackBerry Desktop Manager automatically starts backing
up your BlackBerry information onto your PC. You can
follow the backup progress from the Transfer In Progress
window that appears (see Figure 14-3).
Figure 14-3: A backup is in progress.
Do not unplug your BlackBerry from the PC until the
backup process finishes! Depending on how much informa-
tion you have on your BlackBerry, the backup might take
five to ten minutes to finish.
Chapter 14: Protecting Your Information 179

4. When the Transfer In Progress window disappears, you
are finished with the BlackBerry backup process and
may unplug the Pearl from the PC.
Setting up automatic backups
What is better than backing up your information once?
Remembering to back up regularly! What’s better than regularly
backing up? You guessed it — having your PC and BlackBerry run
backups automatically. After you schedule automated backups of
your BlackBerry, you can really have peace of mind when it comes
to preventing information loss.
To set up an autobackup:
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
The Backup and Restore screen appears (refer to 
Figure 14-1).
2. Click the Options button.
The Backup and Restore Options screen appears, as shown
in Figure 14-4, where you can schedule automatic backups.
Figure 14-4: Set autobackups here.
3. Enable the Automatically Backup My Device Every option.
This enables you to configure more options (check boxes
and options become active), such as how often Desktop
Manager should back up your BlackBerry.
4. Select the number of days, between 1 and 99, in the
numeric Days field.
This interval sets how often your BlackBerry will be backed
up. For example, if you enter 14 days, your BlackBerry will
be backed up every 14 days.
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
180

5. In the When Automatically Backing Up My Device section,
select the Backup All Device Application Data option.
This backs up all the data on your Pearl each time auto-
backup runs.
Although you have the option to exclude e-mail messages
and information, such as from Address Book, to-do’s, and
memos, we recommend that you back up everything each
time without any exclusion.
6. Confirm your settings by clicking OK.
Now you can go on with your life without caring too much
about backing up information on your BlackBerry.
To run a back up, you need to connect your BlackBerry Pearl to your
PC. Thus, if you travel often or just don’t link your BlackBerry to your
PC often, make sure you plug your Pearl into your PC once in a while
so the autobackup has a chance to back up your information.
Full Restore from Backup
Information
We hope that you never have to read this section more than once
because every time you perform a full restore from backup, it prob-
ably means that you’ve lost information that you hope to find from
the backup you created on your PC.
The steps to fully restoring your backup information are simple:
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
The Backup and Restore screen appears.
2. Click the Restore button.
Doing so brings up a typical Open file dialog box, asking
you where the backup file is located on your PC.
3. Choose a backup file and then click Open.
A Warning window appears (see Figure 14-5) alerting you
that you’re about to overwrite existing information.
4. From this Warning window, click OK to proceed with the
full restore.
A progress bar similar to Figure 14-3 now appears, showing
progress of the full restore. When the progress bar disap-
pears, your BlackBerry Pearl is now fully restored from the
backup file.
Chapter 14: Protecting Your Information 181

Figure 14-5: Take caution when 
overwriting existing info.
It might take awhile for the full restore to finish. Do not
unplug your Pearl from your PC during this time!
5. When the progress bar disappears, you’re finished with
the restore process and may unplug the Pearl from the PC.
Protecting Your Data, Your Way
A certain burger joint and BlackBerry Pearl have in common that
you can have it your way with their products. Just like you can get
your burger with or without all the extras (such as pickles and
onions), you can choose to not backup and restore things that 
you know you won’t need.
For example, say you’ve accidentally deleted all your Browser
bookmarks and now you want them back. The thing not to do is 
to restore all the information from your last backup, which could
potentially be more than 90 days old (depending on how often
your autobackup runs, if it does). Doing so might overwrite other
information, such as e-mail or your Address Book contacts. The
easiest thing to do is use the selective backup/restore function 
on the BlackBerry Desktop Manager and to restore only Browser
bookmarks.
The same idea goes with backing up. If you are a big e-mail user
and your mailbox is constantly growing, you can choose to back
up just your e-mails and nothing else.
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
182

In this section, we use the term databases. Don’t worry; this isn’t as
technical as you think. Think of a database as an information cate-
gory on the BlackBerry Pearl. For example, saying, “backing up
your Browser bookmarks database” is just a fancy way of saying,
“backing up all your Browser bookmarks on your Pearl.”
We start with selective backup and then go over restoring selectively.
Backing up, your way
To show you how to perform selective backups, we’ll back up just
e-mails and Browser bookmarks.
To back up selectively, follow these steps:
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
The Backup and Restore screen appears (refer to 
Figure 14-1).
2. Click the Advanced button.
The advanced Backup/Restore screen appears, as shown in
Figure 14-6. On the right side of the screen are the different
information categories, or databases, of your BlackBerry.
Figure 14-6: The advanced Backup/Restore screen.
3. Ctrl+click Browser Bookmarks and Browser Messages
(from the right side of the screen) as the databases you
want to back up. Then click the left-facing arrow (the
Backup arrow).
Chapter 14: Protecting Your Information 183

A progress bar moves while your BlackBerry is backed up
selectively. This step merely transfers the databases onto
your PC; it does not save them. When the backup transfer
is finished, you can see the two databases on the left side
of the window.
4. Choose File➪Save As.
5. Name your file and specify where you want to save it on
your PC.
You still need to manually save the backup file on your PC even
after you choose a location for the file in Step 3. A selective backup
does not automatically save your backup on your PC.
Restoring, your way
Selective restoring works in a similar way to a selective backup.
However, when restoring, you need to already have a backup file to
restore from. Although this might sound obvious to you, the point
we are making is that you can selectively restore from any backup,
auto or manual. For example, say you have autobackup running
every other day, and you want to restore only your e-mail mes-
sages from two days ago. You don’t need to do a full restore
because that might overwrite some of the new contacts in your
Address Book. Rather, you can use the selective restoring method
and get back only your e-mail messages.
To restore your way, follow these steps:
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
The Backup and Restore screen appears (refer to 
Figure 14-1).
2. Click the Advanced button.
The advanced Backup/Restore screen appears (refer to
Figure 14-6). The right side of the screen displays the 
different information categories, or databases, of your
BlackBerry Pearl.
3. Choose File➪Open.
This opens a window where you can choose which backup
file you want to restore from.
A BlackBerry backup file has an .ipd suffix.
4. Select a backup file and then click the Open button.
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
184

The different information categories, or databases, appear
on the left side of the screen. You are now ready for a selec-
tive restore.
5. Select the categories, or databases, of your choice.
You can select multiple databases by Ctrl+clicking the 
databases you want.
6. Click the right-facing arrow (the Restore arrow).
You will likely see a Warning window asking whether you
want to replace all the information with the data you are
restoring (refer to Figure 14-5).
If your Pearl has the same categories as the ones you are
restoring (which is likely), you will overwrite any informa-
tion you have on your Pearl.
You can confidently click OK if you know that the database
you’re restoring has the information you’re looking for.
7. From the Warning window, click OK.
A progress bar similar to the one in Figure 14-3 appears
while the selective restore is in progress. When the
progress bar window disappears, the information 
categories that you’ve selected are restored on your
BlackBerry.
Clearing BlackBerry information,
your way
You can also clear, or delete, information on your BlackBerry selec-
tively from the BlackBerry Desktop Manager. And when would you
use selective deletion? Suppose you want to clear only your phone
logs from your BlackBerry. One way is to tediously select one phone
log at a time and press Delete, and then repeat that until all phone
logs are deleted. However, a faster way is to use selective deleting.
The idea is to delete a database from the advanced Backup/Restore
screen by using the Backup and Restore function of the BlackBerry
Desktop Manager.
To selectively delete databases on your BlackBerry, follow 
these steps:
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
The Backup and Restore screen appears (refer to 
Figure 14-1).
Chapter 14: Protecting Your Information 185

2. Click the Advanced button.
The advanced Backup/Restore screen appears (refer to
Figure 14-6). The right side of the screen displays the 
different information categories, or databases, of your
BlackBerry Pearl.
3. Ctrl+click the database(s) you want to delete.
This highlights the database(s).
4. Click the Clear button on the right side of the screen.
A Warning window appears, asking you to confirm your
deletion.
5. Click OK.
A progress bar appears, showing the progress of the dele-
tion. When the progress bar disappears, the information
categories you selected are cleared from your BlackBerry.

Using Your Pearl as a
Portable Flash Drive
In This Chapter
 Getting, inserting, and formatting the card
 Copying your media between PC and Pearl
 Securing your media files
F
irst off the bat, what is a media card? A media card is not what
you use to gain privileged access to some event, “Let me in,
I’m CNN.” No, far from that. How about flash drive? It’s not your
neighbor’s driveway that looks like a runway with those perfectly
aligned solar lights.
Okay, a flash drive contains a flash memory card and a card reader.
The drive is a tiny removable component commonly used in hand-
held devices, such as digital cameras, to store memory. It is typi-
cally lightweight and both readable and writable.
Several types of flash memory cards are available, but in BlackBerry
Pearl land, you need to use a microSD (a flash memory card origi-
nally manufactured by Sandisk), which the Pearl folks refers to as a
media card. You don’t need a reader because BlackBerry Pearl itself
can read the card directly. As of this writing, you can avail yourself
of microSD cards in capacities from 128MB through 2GB. Capacities
are growing fast, so by the time this book is published, it’s conceiv-
able that you might be seeing 4GB to 100GB. (Nah, the last number
mentioned is our wish.)
Feeling lost with all these media files located in multiple devices?
Whether its picture files, music files, or video files, it doesn’t
matter. They seem to be everywhere nowadays, and it’s maddening
when you can’t find the one you need the moment you need it.
Some of the more organized folks among us try to manage files

(any files) by having a copy in a central location. And this location
is usually the desktop computer. No wonder RIM made a point to
make Pearl connect seamlessly with your PC. With a USB connec-
tion, Pearl automatically becomes a virtual drive in your desktop
computer. Once connected, you can use your BlackBerry with a
media card to back up your files to your computer or to copy a file
from your library. What you do with this new portable drive is
beyond us, but this chapter shows you the tricks. This chapter
also describes the details of the Media Card.
The Media Card
What BlackBerry Pearl calls a media card is a tiny microSD. How
tiny is tiny? Just take a look at the left image in Figure 15-1. It’s a
microSD on top of a postage stamp. The microSD barely covers
half the stamp.
Figure 15-1: The tiny media card (left); 
inserting media card here (right).
Acquiring one
When you recently purchased your BlackBerry Pearl, it’s likely that
it didn’t come with a microSD card. But with a little cash, you can
get a decent capacity card from the Web, from a computer store,
from an electronic store such as Best Buy or Circuit City, or even 
at a big discount warehouse such as Costco.
What to buy? The bigger the capacity, the better. Any particular
brands? Well, microSD is originally based on Sandisk’s Transflash
card format. So, getting a Sandisk brand is your safest bet, but you
pay a little premium compared to other brands. To get more infor-
mation on other brands, Google microSD reviews.
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
188

Inserting the card
If you want to use a media card, you need to insert it in the back of
the device. Refer to the right of Figure 15-1 for the exact location.
You have to take off the cover, remove the battery, and slide the
metal slot slightly to the left using your thumb. You should be able
to tilt the slot up and insert the card. Make sure that the metal 
portion of the card is facing down. Push down the metal slot 
with the card in it and slide it slightly back to the right. The slot
should snugly fit back in place. Put back the battery and slide 
back the cover and you’re on your way to enjoying a bigger media
memory storage.
Formatting the card
When you first insert a new media card to your BlackBerry Pearl,
the card might not be formatted, so your device may not be able to
use it. No worries, you can easily format the card and things will go
smoothly after that.
Follow these steps to format your media:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Security Options.
2. Select Advanced Options and then select Media Card.
The Media Card screen appears, as shown in Figure 15-2.
Figure 15-2: Set your Media 
Card options here.
3. Press the Menu key and select Format Card.
A screen shows up, warning you that any content on 
this card will be wiped and lost.
Chapter 15: Using Your Pearl as a Portable Flash Drive 189

4. Select Yes.
Your media card is now formatted.
Formatting a media card means wiping clean all its contents. 
If you’ve used this media card before and have files in it, say 
goodbye to them.
To figure out the total amount of space as well as the free space on
your media card, you can find it in the Media Card screen (refer to
Figure 15-2).
Setting to mass storage mode
Mass storage mode means allowing your BlackBerry Pearl to
behave as a PC flash drive. You can keep it enabled, but the default
is Prompt, as shown in Figure 15-2. Prompt means whenever you
connect the BlackBerry Pearl to your PC, the device will prompt to
enable mass storage mode.
So, if you want your device to become a flash drive, always make
sure that you answer Yes on the prompt or you can set it to always
on by going to the Media screen as described in Steps 1 and 2 in
the preceding section. In the Media screen, highlight the Auto
Enable Mass Storage Mode field, press the trackball, and select
Yes. Then press the Menu key and select Save.
Copying Files between 
the PC and Pearl
The easy part is connecting the Pearl to the PC — even a six-year-
old can do this. All you need is your BlackBerry Pearl, your desk-
top computer, and the USB cable that came with your device.
When talking about a desktop computer, we mean a PC running
Windows 98, 2000, XP, or Vista. If you are a Mac user, please refer
to our companion Web site for details on how to copy files
between your Mac and Pearl:
www.blackberryfordummies.com/pearl
Connect the PC and your BlackBerry Pearl using the USB cable,
and your computer should detect the device and display a screen
similar to Figure 15-3. You can choose from any of the options in
this screen.
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
190

Figure 15-3: Choose what you do 
with your flash drive here.
For example, to copy a file, select Open Folder to View Files. This
opens the familiar Windows Explorer screen, as shown in Figure
15-4. After you get to this screen, you basically can do anything
you do with a normal Windows folder. You can drag and drop files,
copy files, and delete files.
Figure 15-4: Your flash drive opens in a familiar 
Windows Explorer folder.
Securing Your Files
Most of the time, security is the last thing you think about when
you’re using a flash drive — although you might begin to become
uneasy when you start copying sensitive information into the drive.
We’re not talking about embarrassing pictures; we’re talking about
information such as bank statements, tax statements, or employment
contracts. Now, consider the statistics of cellphones left in taxi cabs
and your mind begins to wonder about all the nasty possibilities. You
don’t have to go far with your imagination. Just relax because the
Chapter 15: Using Your Pearl as a Portable Flash Drive 191

good people at RIM are serious about security. Your device is capable
of encrypting files stored in the media card.
You need to do two things to make sure that security is as tight as
possible. One is to set a device password. This ensures that no one
can take a look at what’s inside your BlackBerry even if it falls in
the wrong hands. And two, encrypt the files in your media card.
This makes sure that if someone attempts to open the media card,
it will ask for your secret password.
Setting a device password
You can set a secret password for your device that you’ll be
prompted to enter every time you try to open the Pearl. It’s quite
easy to do, just follow these steps:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Options.
2. Select Security Options and then select General Settings.
3. Highlight the Password field, press the trackball, and
select Enabled.
Setting the Password field to Enabled requires you to enter
a password each time you open your BlackBerry. After you
save this setting, your BlackBerry Pearl will ask you for this
password.
4. Press the Menu key and select Save.
At this point, two screens shows up in succession; one to
initially enter your password and the second one for you to
confirm the password.
5. Enter the password you want and press the trackball. Do
the same for the confirmation screen.
Your device now requires you to enter a password.
Encrypting media files
Your BlackBerry offers three modes for encrypting files in your
media card. Here’s the rundown:
 Device: Your device generates an encryption key.
 Security Password: The files are encrypted using the device
password you entered.
 Security Password & Device: The files are encrypted using
the device password and a device-generated encryption key.
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
192

Encrypting your media files is easy, here’s how:
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key and select
Options.
2. Select Advanced Options and then select Media Card.
A Media Card screen appears, as shown in Figure 15-2. To
encrypt your media files, you need to set the following
values:
• Media Card Support: On.
• Encryption Mode: Device, Security Password, 
or Security Password & Device.
• Encrypt Media Files: Yes.
3. Press the Menu key and select Save.
4. If you choose an Encryption Mode of Security Password
or Security Password & Device, respond to the two
screens that appear in succession.
The first screen allows you to enter the Security Password
and the second one confirms the password.
Just in case your memory fails you, the Password Keeper is always
there. So, use it to store your media card password. Refer to
Chapter 6 for more info on the Password Keeper.
If you choose to encrypt your media files, every time you connect
your BlackBerry to a PC, it will ask for the password. The password
prompt is in the device, not in the PC.

Ten Great BlackBerry
Accessories
In This Chapter
 BlackBerry accessories you can’t live without
 Where to buy them
T
he BlackBerry retail box contains a few essentials: a battery, a
charger, and a USB cable. If you’re like us, though, you’re not
satisfied with just what’s included in the box. In this chapter, we
present the accessories that we think supplement your BlackBerry
well and also where to shop for them. 
For more on BlackBerry Pearl games and productivity programs,
please check our companion Web site
www.blackberryfordummies.com/pearl/ten/index.html
Cases for Protection and Style
If your Pearl didn’t come with a case (most don’t), you need to 
get one so when you carry it around, it doesn’t get scratched or
damaged. Whether you like a sporty look or a professional look,
here are a few recommendations. These cases will set you back
anywhere from $20–$40, which isn’t too bad for looking hip.

http://store.blackberryden.com/bluepearl.html
 BlackBerryStuff.com:
www.blackberrystuff.com/blackberry-8100-
pearl-case-accessory.htm

BlackBerry Screen Protector
If the protector case described in the preceding section is a bit
stressful for your wallet, try Screenguardz, for only $12. Your
screen will be scratchless with Screenguardz. You can get it from
BlackberrySource.com, at
www.blackberrysource.com/store/catalog.asp?item=680
MicroSD Memory Card
If you want to store lots of music, pictures, or simply files on your
BlackBerry Pearl, you definitely need to get a microSD memory
card. Depending on your needs, microSD memory capacity ranges
from 32MB to 2GB. You can get a card from almost all the online
shops. Here are just a couple places to get you started:
 Amazon.com: 
www.amazon.com/SanDisk-MicroSD-Card-Retail-Package/
dp/B000EEZCEG/sr=8-1/qid=1162737636/ref=pd_bbs_sr_
1/102-7738096-2386528?ie=UTF8&s=electronics
 Buy.com:
www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?loc=101&sku =202611635
If your laptop comes with an SD slot, make sure to buy a microSD
card that comes with a card adapter. That way, you can use the same
microSD card for your laptop. Two uses for the price of one. Nice!
Long Live Your BlackBerry
An extra battery for your BlackBerry will come in handy if you’re 
a daily BlackBerry user. We recommend that you buy your battery
only from Research in Motion (RIM), the maker of BlackBerry, and
not from some other manufacturer because a faulty battery can
seriously damage your BlackBerry beyond repair.
You can buy a battery manufactured by RIM from

www.shopblackberry.com.

pearl-battery-accessory.htm
Part V: The Part of Tens 
198

Replenishing Your BlackBerry
If you’re always on the go, you better have a portable charger on
hand. The charger included with your BlackBerry is great to carry
around town (and the world) because it has multiple adapters for
different countries’ electric plugs. The one we recommend is the
BlackBerry Car Charger, which is great for all you road warriors out
there. It will set you back around $30. Get your car charger from the
official RIM online shopping store: www.shopblackberry.com.
Make sure that the charger you buy is for your BlackBerry model.
Bluetooth Hands-Free Headset
If you’re a frequent phone user, we definitely recommend that you
pick up a Bluetooth hands-free headset. Even though a wired
hands-free headset comes with your BlackBerry, the convenience
of a wireless Bluetooth hands-free headset is hard to live without.
Plenty of Bluetooth headsets are on the market for you to choose
from. Here is our short-list:
 Jabra BT150
 Motorola HS850, H700, or H500
 Plantronics Explorer 320 or Voyager 510
When choosing a headset consider a comfortable fit, the voice
quality, and whether it has a rechargeable battery.
You probably need to spend anywhere from $50–$100 for a hands-
free headset. The best place to get your Bluetooth headset is good
ol’ Amazon.com: www.amazon.com.
Full Keyboard
If you compose long e-mails and draft long proposals on your
BlackBerry, a full-sized keyboard is perfect for you. Not only will
you save on typing time, but you will also save your thumbs from
blistering.
You have your choice of Bluetooth and non-Bluetooth 
connection options.
Chapter 16: Ten Great BlackBerry Accessories 199

 Bluetooth: At the time of writing, only one portal Bluetooth
keyboard was available. We plan to offer more updates on this
on our Web site, www.blackberryfordummies.com. For less
than $100, you can own this cool Bluetooth keyboard. Not too
bad for a wireless keyboard. Here’s where to get the one that’s
available: eAccess Solutions, at www.eaccess-estore.com.
 USB cable: For about $200, you can get a USB cable keyboard.
The price is a bit stiff, but depending on how you use your
BlackBerry, it might be a good investment. Go to Man &
Machine at www.man-machine.com/coolmir.htm.
External Speaker Phone
Even though some of you have a BlackBerry that comes with 
a speaker phone, sometimes the sound quality just isn’t good
enough for you to comprehend the phone conversation while in a
car. Check out the wireless Bluetooth speaker phone, Blue Vision
Bluetooth Speakerphone. For about $100, you can get it from
BlackBerrySource.com:
www.blackberrysource.com/store/catalog.asp?item=236
BlackBerry Car Mount
To complete your BlackBerry car experience, you need a place to
mount your BlackBerry in your car. Enter the Auto PDA Holder Kit.
For about $30, your BlackBerry will be securely fastened to the
Auto PDA Holder so that your BlackBerry is in your sight at all
times. You can get it from BlackberrySource.com:
www.blackberrysource.com/store/catalog.asp?item=217
BlackBerry Pearl Cleaner
After you have your Pearl for more than a day, it’s no longer clean
and shiny. Instead, it’s covered with fingerprints and smudges. The
solution: Monster ScreenClean kit, which comes with a nonabrasive
microfiber cloth. The ScreenClean kit work wonders not only on
your BlackBerry Pearl but also on all types of surfaces — LCD, TV,
and iPod. You can get it here:
www.monstercable.com/productPage.asp?pin=2350

Chapter 17
Ten Must-Have BlackBerry
Pearl Programs
In This Chapter
 Ten must-have applications for your BlackBerry Pearl
 Where to download these applications
Your BlackBerry Pearl is a relatively new product, but
BlackBerry has been with us for quite some time. And the
industry of BlackBerry software is exploding at a dizzying rate. It’s
no longer easy to find out which of these applications are getting
traction and hitting the mainstream user base, not to mention
which ones are worth using. The ten applications we feature here
are just the tip of the iceberg. By all means, feel free to surf the
Internet because by the time this book is published, more software
will likely be available. And don’t forget to visit our Web site at
www.blackberryfordummies.com/pearl/ten/index.html
AskMeNow
Stop scratching your head. When you have a pressing question, you
don’t need to look for answers anywhere other than your BlackBerry
Pearl. After you install the AskMeNow application, a guru is ready to
answer that nagging question in your head. If your query can possibly
be answered by a human being, you can ask it here. If you don’t know
what to ask, AskMeNow has precanned questions such as directions,
weather, sports updates, and flight information. The answer is sent to
you through e-mail, usually within two minutes. AskMeNow started as
free, then became a fee service, but now it’s back to being free again.
We hope that when this book is published, the service will still be
free. We’ve been using AskMeNow and we can tell you that it’s great.
For a free trial download, from your BlackBerry Pearl, go to
www.blackberryfordummies.com/pearl/ten/ask.html

BBToday
If you’re experiencing information overload, you’re not alone.
BBToday helps you make sense of all this information without 
so much hair-pulling. In a nutshell, BBToday tries to give you 
a tearsheet on a daily basis. The nice thing about BBToday is 
its capability to show up every time you unlock or open your
BlackBerry Pearl. It displays full screen with the following 
information in a summarized format:
 Current date and time
 E-mail summary
 Remaining battery strength
 Signal strength
 Appointments scheduled for the day
 Tasks scheduled for the day
 Current weather information and five-day forecast
 Phone call summary
 Stock quotes
This is like having an assistant tell you what your day will be like,
organizing your PIM (personal information manager) information,
and presenting it in such a way that you don’t have to spend time
viewing each of your PIM applications. You can configure the
weather to point to your local area. You can also add the stock
ticker for the stock quotes section. You can download BBToday 
for free from your BlackBerry Pearl by going to
www.blackberryfordummies.com/pearl/ten/bbtoday.html
English Language Acronyms
Dictionary for BlackBerry 4.0
Your BlackBerry Pearl can be a good and reliable acronyms dict-
ionary whenever you need one; just download English Language
Acronyms Dictionary for BlackBerry 4.0. Of course, you could argue
that you can use Browser and get a free dictionary from the Web, but
this one works even when you’re out of range. The software is easy to
use and has more than 12,000 English acronyms. To download, go to
www.blackberryfordummies.com/pearl/ten/ea.html
This is another freebie, so there’s no reason for not getting it.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
202

Berry411
Here’s another free program in your arsenal. Berry411 works the
same as your local 411 information source, but you don’t have to
pay for the service. You get yellow as well as white pages. We
found this useful for getting movie times for local movie theaters. 
If you’re traveling, simply use the address information of the hotel
where you’re staying, and Berry411 can get local information based
on that address. To download, go to
www.blackberryfordummies.com/pearl/ten/b411.html
Handmark Pocket Express
The Handmark Pocket Express is a one-stop shop with a dizzying
amount of information. You’ll get the following features: 411 direc-
tory search, street maps, driving directions, movie showtimes,
portfolio tracking, American writers, thesaurus, Dear Abby, Last
Word in Astrology, News of the Weird, Scott Burns columns,
NASCAR Insider, Motor Sports, and almost all categories of news.
What’s the catch? Not everything comes for free. To get the most
out of it, you have to pay a subscription of $69.90 a year or $6.99 a
month. From your PC or your BlackBerry Pearl Browser, go to
www.blackberryfordummies.com/pearl/ten/hpe.html
Stock Ticker
In the world of stock markets, timing is everything. For those who
are actively trading — if you can’t enjoy your latté without worry-
ing about what’s going on with your stocks — here is a piece of
software that helps. Stock Ticker gives you the latest quotes and
stock information, even when you’re not looking at your three
stock-monitor terminals. It features a scrolling interface with
minute-by-minute news and commentaries. For about $50 a year,
you can download Stock Ticker from your PC at
www.blackberryfordummies.com/pearl/ten/st.html
Wisespent Professional
Now, this is cool: expense tracker software, right on your hand-
held. The developers of Wisespent Professional listened to their
customers and made many updates based on their feedback and
Chapter 17: Ten Must-Have BlackBerry Pearl Programs 203

requests. At the time of this writing, the software is version 3.0.
What’s nice about Wisespent is its support for importing data to
popular expense software such as Quicken. For $23, you can down-
load Wisespent Professional from your PC by going to
www.blackberryfordummies.com/pearl/ten/ws.html
trackIT: Vehicle Edition
Turn your BlackBerry Pearl into an extensive vehicle tracking system.
The trackIT: Vehicle Edition software tracks maintenance, mileage,
fuel, expenses, and more. It’s loaded with features and easy to use.
The price is $24.95, and you can download it to your PC by going to
www.blackberryfordummies.com/pearl/ten/trackit.html
Ascendo Fitness for BlackBerry
For the heath-conscious among us, here is award-winning software
for your BlackBerry Pearl. Ascendo Fitness allows you to take con-
trol of your health by helping you track calories from what you eat
and how you burn them in your exercise. It presents your progress
using graphs. Based on your data, Ascendo calculators give you
your ideal or healthy weight, your Body Mass Index (BMI), maximum
heart rate based on age, and Basal Metabolism Ratio (BMR). We’ve
heard many good comments from those who use this product. For
$27, you can download Ascendo Fitness to your PC by going to
www.blackberryfordummies.com/pearl/ten/asc.html
4INFO Mobile
We haven’t forgotten the sport fanatics among us. 4INFO Mobile
software sports a cutting-edge wireless service, allowing you to
search for scores, player stats, and schedules for the NBA, MLB,
NHL, and PGA. NFL schedules should be coming soon, so by the
time this book is published, they might be available. Did we men-
tion that you can check for your flight status for arrival and depar-
ture as well? Or check for movie times and schedules and lots more
information. And the best thing is, it’s free. Download 4INFO at
