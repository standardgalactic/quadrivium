Introduction
The Apple MacBook is one of the leading devices that are made from the top computer
manufacturer Apple Inc. It was first released in 2006 and now it is re-released in March of
2015.
It is billed as a thin and portable notebook that has a similar design to the MacBook Air.
The initial colors released are Silver, Space Gray and Gold. It carries features such as the
Retina Display, Trackpad, Redeveloped Keyboard and Two Ports.
It was designed to be a full experience in a light and compact computer that is immensely
powerful. This book will seek to cover many of the features of the unit to properly inform
the reader.
1. Amazing Design
The new MacBook was designed with power in mind while keeping the unit small
and compact. Apple set out to make the unit thinner and better than the previous
notebooks. What they ended up with is the flagship of the industry.
 
2.       Keyboard
The keyboard is one of the design approaches that was upgraded. It is still a full size
keyboard that uses half of the space. This is essential to user friendliness and Apple
has achieved this construction.
 
3.       Improved Display
The display has been redesigned with an edge to edge glass that brings the display
into sharp focus. When viewing the screen, the content is rich and vibrant with vivid
details. It contains over 3 million pixels that render the content with crystal clarity

with energy efficiency to top it all off.
 
4.       Great Trackpad
The trackpad has also been improved with a brand new experience with Force
Touch. It has new features such as better response, uniform clicking no matter where
is pressed and force sensors to detect the pressure that is being applied to the
surface. The additional features gives the user new capabilities based on the new
functionality.
 
5.       Wireless capabilities
The new MacBook is equipped to be fully wireless and handle all its capabilities
with the least amount of effort. The machine takes advantage of the latest Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth technology which makes the unit capable of connection virtually
anywhere. There is no need for cords to transfer your files, photos or music.
 
6.       USB-C port
The new USB-C port allows the user to efficiently charge their unit by connecting
the charger to it. It is an advanced port that allows charging and the fastest USB
transference. The design is also made to be small and compact making it about 1/3
the size of a regular USB port.
 
7.       Efficient performance
The MacBook has been engineered to provide good performance that runs on a 5th
generation Intel Core M processor that runs on approximately 5 watts of power. It is
also made more efficient through the use of OS X Yosemite. The efficient balance of
power makes the unit run very resourcefully.
 
8.       Battery Life
The Apple notebooks are known for their great battery life and the new MacBook is
no different. It offers up to 9 hours battery power while still retaining the thin shape
of the unit. This was achieved through Apple developing its own type of battery to
comfortably fit in the slim space and still be very powerful.
 
9.       OS X Operating System
The OS X Operating System is what powers the newer versions of Mac computers.
The foundation of the system is solid as a rock and is designed to efficiently use all
the hardware that is available to it. The operating system allows all you iOS and

Mac devices to work smoothly together.
 
10.   Built-in Apps
The apps that are on the system are produced to allow the user to be creative and
useful in anything they have to do. There are many apps that allow the user to carry
out many of their functions quite easily with the least amount of effort from the user.
An application search can be done in the app store to find an app that will do what
you want. Many times you will search for an app that you do not know exists and
when it is found it may prove to be useful.
 
11.   App Store
The app store is the place where the user will go to find the apps they need for their
device. A simple search can be done to find apps of many kinds that can do many
things the user may require. There are over one million apps that can be searched
and they will be certain to find something that will suit them.
 
12.   Solid Invention
The MacBook was designed to be powerful and efficient while being thinner and
lighter. While doing this, it is functional and intuitive. Apple took the time to
redevelop the complete design from scratch to ensure that no stone was left unturned
in the development of the new version.
 
13.   Butterfly Mechanism
The traditional approach to the keyboard used the scissor mechanism which would
give trouble of wobbling around the edges of the keyboard. This may cause the lack
of precision which would end up with the user making multiple mistakes and typing
inefficient. The makers have reduced this wobbling and made typing better by using
the butterfly mechanism which makes it more responsive to the key strokes.
 
14.   Design of the Keys
The area on the keys are much bigger which is in fact a larger surface area that uses
thinner construction with deep curvature. It allows for more space for the fingertips
so typing is distinct and intuitive. This approach along with the butterfly
mechanism, gives the user better control when they are typing.
 
15.   Keyboard Backlight
In addition to the efficiently designed keyboard, Apple has figured out how to

illuminate keys without taking up much of the space that is was saving in the first
place. They did this by putting an LED under each key with uniform brightness and
maintaining the energy efficiency.
 
16.   3 Million Pixels
The unit comes with a 12 inch Retina display that is sharp with over 3 million
pixels. This amazing display packed into a paper thin device is stunning. This
machine holds the title of having the thinnest retina display ever on a Mac computer.
The edge to edge glass that is utilized is only 0.5 millimeter thick and it is developed
by using an automated manufacturing process.
 
17.   Design Approach
To achieve the improved retina display, they had to employ great innovation all the
way down to the pixel. The pixels were redesigned to allow more light to pass
through based on the larger aperture. The new approach allowed the machine to be
about 30% more energy efficient based on the changes. This is one of the new
approaches in the design which allows it to be a well thought out unit that places
emphasis on efficiency.
 
18.   Taptic Engine
With the new Force Touch trackpad the force sensors can detect wherever the user
will click to make a selection. The taptic engine is used to provide haptic feedback

too.  There is a tangible response that is given to your fingertip when certain tasks
are performed.
 
19.   Force Touch
The force touch features puts a new dynamic to the multi touch gestures that you
have been used to in previous machines. That is, in addition to the scrolling,
swiping, pinching and rotating. The force touch allows the user to adjust how much
pressure they should give to register a click. The trackpad can even detect whether it
is a thumb or finger so the sensitivity level can be adjusted appropriately.
 
20.   Accelerators
There is a feature that will recognize the amount of pressure that is being applied
and allow the user to fast forward through things such as videos or zoom through
easily on something like a Map.

 
21.   Pressure sensitive actions
