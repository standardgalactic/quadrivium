Securing Azure OpenAI Service
•
Azure has powerful security controls that helps securing cloud 
resources
•
These controls can be applied also to OpenAI Service

Securing Azure OpenAI Service
•
OpenAI Service can be protected using:
Network Security
Azure AD Identity

Network Security
•
Access to OpenAI service can be limited to specific networks
•
Can be also denied from public network and allowed only from 
VNets using private IP
•
This is done using Private Endpoint
•
The most secure network access

Azure AD Identity
•
So far we used API key to access OpenAI
•
Not very secure
•
Anyone who has the key can access the resource
•
It’s more secure to use Azure AD identity
•
Only authorized users and services can access the resource
•
No need to use api-key
