Abstract
Over the 3.8 billion years since life is estimated to have begun to appear on Earth, evolution has
resolved many of nature’s challenges leading to lasting solutions with maximal performance using
minimal resources. Nature’s inventions have always inspired human achievement and have led to
effective algorithms, methods, materials, processes, structures, tools, mechanisms, and systems.
There are numerous examples of biomimetic successes including some that are simple copies of
nature, such as the use of ﬁns for swimming. Other examples were inspired by biological capabil-
ities with greater complexity including the mastery of ﬂying that became possible only after the
principles of aerodynamics were better understood. Some commercial implementations of biomi-
metics can be readily found in toy stores, where robotic toys are increasingly appearing and
behaving like living creatures. More substantial beneﬁts of biomimetics include the development
of prosthetics that closely mimic real limbs as well as sensory-enhancing microchips that are being
used to interface with the brain to assist in hearing, seeing, and controlling instruments. In this book,
various aspects of the ﬁeld of biomimetics are reviewed, examples of inspiring biological models
and practical applications of biomimetics are described, and challenges and potential directions of
the ﬁeld are discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Imagine a smart microchip that is buried in the ground for a long time. Upon certain triggering
conditions this chip begins to grow and consume materials from its surroundings, converting them
into energy and structural cells. As the chip grows further, it reconﬁgures its shape to become a
mobile robot. Using its recently created mobility, the chip becomes capable of searching and
locating critical resources consuming them to grow even more. The type and function of the
speciﬁc cells that are formed depend on each cell’s role within the growing structure. This
science-ﬁction scenario is inspired by true-life biology such as the growth of chicks from an egg
or plants from a seed. Yet given all our technological advances, it is still impossible to engineer
such a reality.
Bionics as the term for the ﬁeld of study involving copying, imitating, and learning from biology
was coined by Jack Steele of the US Air Force in 1960 at a meeting at Wright–Patterson Air Force
Base in Dayton, Ohio (Vincent, 2001). Otto H. Schmitt coined the term Biomimetics in 1969
(Schmitt, 1969) and this ﬁeld is increasingly involved with emerging subjects of science and
engineering. The term itself is derived from bios, meaning life, and mimesis, meaning to imitate.
This new science represents the study and imitation of nature’s methods, designs, and processes.
While some of its basic conﬁgurations and designs can be copied, many ideas from nature are best
adapted when they serve as inspiration for human-made capabilities. In this book, both biologically
inspired and biologically mimicked technologies are discussed, and the terms biology, creatures,
and nature are used synonymously.
Nature has always served as a model for mimicking and inspiration for humans in their desire
to improve their life. By adapting mechanisms and capabilities from nature, scientiﬁc approaches
have helped humans understand related phenomena and associated principles in order to engineer
novel devices and improve their capability. The cell-based structure, which makes up the majority
of biological creatures, offers the ability to grow with fault-tolerance and self-repair, while doing

all of the things that characterize biological systems. Biomimetic structures that are made of
multiple cells would allow for the design of devices and mechanisms that are impossible with
today’s capabilities. Emerging nano-technologies are increasingly enabling the potential of such
capabilities.
The beak of birds may have served as an inspiring model for the development of the tweezers
and the tong. While it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd evidence that it had inspired early humans, one can argue
that since nature invented this device ﬁrst it was a widely known concept way before humans began
making tweezers and tongs. The mimicking of the beak is illustrated graphically on the cover page
of this book, where a virtual mirror is drawn to represent the inspiration of adapting nature’s
capabilities. Although enormous advances have been made in the ﬁeld of biomimetics, nature is
still far superior to what we are capable of making or adapting. Given the limitation of today’s
technology, copying nature may not be the most effective approach. Many examples exist where
humans using nature as inspiration have used its principles to invent far more effective solutions;
ﬂying is one such example. This book focuses on the technologies that resulted from both
mimicking and being inspired by biology.
Nature evolves by responding to its needs and ﬁnding solutions that work, and most
importantly, that last through innumerable generations while passing the test of survival to
reach its next generation. Geological studies suggest the presence of life on Earth as early as
3.8 billion years ago (Lowman, 2002). Speciﬁcally, in Greenland, a series of ancient metamorph-
osed sediments were found with carbon isotope signatures that appear to have been produced by
organisms that lived when the sediments were deposited. Furthermore, fossil evidence
indicates that ancient bacteria, Archea (Archaebacteria), have existed on the Earth for at least
3.5 billion years (Schopf, 1993; Petr, 1996). After billions of years of trial and error experiments,
which turn failures to fossils, nature has created an enormous pool of effective solutions. It is
important to note however that the extinction of a species is not necessarily the result of a failed
solution; it can be the result of outside inﬂuences, such as signiﬁcant changes in climate, the
impact of asteroids, volcanic activity, and other conditions that seriously affect the ability of
speciﬁc creatures to survive. The adaptations of nature have led to the evolution of millions of
species — each with its own way of meeting its needs in harmony with the environment
(Research Report, 1992).
Through evolution, nature has ‘‘experimented’’ with various solutions to challenges and
has improved upon successful solutions. Organisms that nature created, which are capable of
surviving, are not necessarily optimal for their technical performance. Effectively, all they need
to do is to survive long enough to reproduce. Living systems archive the evolved and accumulated
information by coding it into the species’ genes and passing the information from generation to
generation through self-replication. Thus, through evolution, nature or biology has experimented
with the principles of physics, chemistry, mechanical engineering, materials science, mobility,
control, sensors, and many other ﬁelds that we recognize as science and engineering. The process
has also involved scaling from nano and macro, as in the case of bacteria and virus, to the macro and
mega, including our life scale and the dinosaurs, respectively. Although there is still doubt
regarding the reason for the extinction of creatures such as the mammoth, it may be argued that
the experiment in the evolution of mega-scale terrestrial biology failed. While marine creatures
such as the whales survived, nature’s experiment with large size terrestrial biology ended with the
extinction of the prehistoric mega-creatures (e.g., dinosaurs and mammoths). Such creatures can
now be found only in excavation sites and natural history museums.
As the evolution process continues, biology has created and continues to create effective
solutions that offer great models for copying or as inspiration for novel engineering methods,
processes, materials, algorithms, etc. Adapting biology can involve copying the complete appear-
ance and function of speciﬁc creatures like the many toys found in toy stores, which are increas-
ingly full of simplistic imitations of electro-mechanized toys such as dogs that walk and bark, frogs
that swim, and such others. However, while we have copied or adapted many of nature’s solutions

an enormous number of mysteries remain unravelled. Humans have learned a lot from nature and
the results help surviving generations and continue to secure a sustainable future.
This book reviews the various aspects of biomimetics from modeling to applications as well as
various scales of the ﬁeld from cell to macro-structures. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the ﬁeld
of biomimetics addressing technologies that mimic biology versus those that adapt its principles
using biology as an inspiring model. Chapter 2 describes biological mechanisms as models for
mimicking. Chapter 3 examines the mechanization of cognition and the creation of knowledge, and
the various aspects of processing by the brain as a basis for autonomous operation. Another angle of
this issue is covered in Chapter 4, where evolutionary robotics and open-ended design automation
are described. One of the widely used biologically inspired algorithms, the genetic algorithm, is
described in Chapter 5 using a mathematical imitation of evolution and natural selection. Robotics
is increasingly inspired by biology and robots that are close imitation of animals and humans are
emerging with incredible capability as described in Chapter 6. The details of making a biological
system as a model are discussed in the following chapters where biologically inspired molecular
machines are described in Chapter 7 and molecular design of biological and nano-materials in
Chapter 8. The next two chapters deal with biological and artiﬁcial muscles with Chapter 9
describing engineered muscle actuators and Chapter 10 covering the topic of artiﬁcial muscles
using electroactive polymers (EAP). An important aspect of biology and systems is the use of
sensors and Chapter 11 covers the topic of vision as an example of bio-sensors. One of the unique
characteristics of biological materials and structures is their multifunctionality and these materials
are covered in Chapter 12. Other aspects of biological systems that offer important models for
imitation are described in the chapters that follow. Chapter 13 covers defense and attack strategies
and mechanisms in biology; Chapter 14 covers biological materials in engineering mechanisms;
Chapter 15 describes mechanisms and applications of functional surfaces in biology. One of the
critical issues of operating systems is that of control and Chapter 16 examines the issue of
biomimetic and biologically inspired control. Interfacing the body with artiﬁcial devices is covered
in the next two chapters with Chapter 17 describing interfacing microelectronics and the human
body and Chapter 18 covering artiﬁcial support and replacement of human organs. Plants also serve
as a model for inspiration and Chapter 19 describes the topic of nastic structures, which are active
materials that enact and mimic plant movements. Chapter 20 of this book includes an overview,
description, challenges, and outlook for the ﬁeld of biomimetics.
This chapter provides an overview of some of the key biology areas that inspired humans to
produce an imitation. This includes making artiﬁcial, synthesized, inspired, and copied mechan-
isms, as well as processes, techniques, and other biomimetic aspects. There are many examples but
only a select few are given in this chapter to illustrate the successes and the possibilities.
1.2
MIMICKING AND INSPIRATION OF NATURE
Biology offers a great model for imitation, copying and learning, and also as inspiration for new
technologies (Benyus, 1998). Flying was inspired by birds using human developed capabilities
(Figure 1.1), whereas the design and function of ﬁns, which divers use, was copied from the legs of
water creatures such as the seal, goose, and frog. But the distinction between technologies resulting
from the various adaptive approaches is not always clear. For instance, studying photosynthesis in a
leaf may lead some to argue that the invention of the solar cell is an imitation, while others may see
it as a biologically inspired technology. While both photosynthesis and solar cell use sunlight as a
source of energy, they neither perform the same process nor create the same output.
Biologically inspired terms such as male and female connectors, as well as teeth of a saw are
common, and it is very clear to us what they mean. Other terms derived from biology the usage of
which are clearly understood include the heart to suggest the center, the head to indicate the
beginning, the foot or tail to imply the end, the brain to describe a computing system. Likewise, the
4
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

use of the terms intelligent or smart suggests the emulation of biological capabilities with a certain
degree of feedback and decision making. Other terms include aging, fatigue, death, digestion, life
cycle, and even ‘‘high on the food chain’’ (referring to a high management level). In the world of
computers and software many biological terms are used to describe aspects of technology including
virus, worm, infection, quarantine, replicate, and hibernate. Other forms of imitating nature
comprise virtual reality, simulations and copying of structures and materials. Shapes are also
used as recognizable terms where the dog-bone provides a clear description of the shape of test
coupons that are used to measure the tensile module and strength of materials. Structures are also
widely copied, for example the honeycomb. Used for its efﬁcient packing structure by bees (which
is different from its use in aerospace — for low weight and high strength), the honeycomb has the
same overall shape in both biological and aerospace structures. It could be reasoned that the
honeycomb structures, which are used in many of the aircraft structures of today’s airplanes,
were not copied from the bees (Gordon, 1976). However, since it is a commonly known structure
invented by nature many years before humans arrived, no patent can be granted in the ‘‘patent
court’’ of nature to the ﬁrst human who produced this conﬁguration. Generally, biological materials
(Chapter 14), including silk and wool that are widely used in clothing, have capabilities that surpass
those made by humans. This superb capability of biological materials, structures, and processes has
been the subject of imitation in artiﬁcial versions of materials.
Plants can also offer a model for imitation (Chapter 19). Besides their familiar characteristics,
some plants exhibit actuation capabilities that are expected of biological creatures. Such plants
include the mimosa and the Sensitive Fern (Onoclea sensibilis) that fold or close their leaves
when touched (Figure 1.2). There are also bug-eating plants with a leaf derived trap ‘‘door’’
that closes and traps unsuspecting bugs that enter to become prey. Examples of such plants include
the Venus Flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) and the Pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea) (Figure 1.3).
The sunﬂower tracks the sun’s direction throughout the day to maximize exposure to its light. Plants
have evolved in various ways, and some have produced uncommon solutions to their special needs.
For example, some desert plants have ﬂowers that produce the malodor of rotten meat, and some
even have a brown color that appears very much like decomposing meat. Such characteristics are
critical for these plants to attract ﬂies, rather than bees, to pollinate their ﬂowers.
Figure 1.1
The image of the Egyptian God Khensu with wings (left) illustrates the age-old fantasy of humans of
being able to ﬂy. (Photographed by the author at the Smithsonian Museum, Washington, DC.) This fantasy turned
to reality with the use of aerodynamic principles leading to enormous capabilities such as the supersonic passenger
plane, the Concord on the right. (Photographed by the author at the Boeing Aerospace Museum, Seattle,
Washington.)

1.2.1
Synthetic Life
Advances in understanding and unraveling the genetic code, and the ability to manipulate and
splice genes have made the possibility of creating synthetic life an increasing reality. Biologists
are now able to engineer bacteria and develop drugs that otherwise must be extracted from rare
plants at very high costs. Further, bacteria and yeast are being produced to build proteins with
synthetic amino acids having novel properties that are impossible to ﬁnd in nature. Researchers
are also working on assembling simple cells from basic components with an ability that is

much broader than recombining DNA. The possibility of synthetically producing living cells
fromscratch is increasingly becoming a near future potential (http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/
DynaPage.taf?ﬁle ¼ /nature/journal/v431/n7009/full/431624a_fs.html).
This
subject,
however,
will not be covered any further in this book since the subject is outside the scope of the book’s
objective.
1.3
ARTIFICIAL LIFE
The name artiﬁcial life (A-Life) suggests the synthesizing of life from nonliving components.
A-Life is a technical ﬁeld that is dedicated to the investigation of scientiﬁc, engineering, philo-
sophical, and social issues involved in our rapidly increasing technological capability to synthesize
from scratch life-like behaviors using computers, machines, molecules, and other alternative media
(Langton, 1995). A-Life focuses on the broad characteristics of biology and contributes to the
development of machines that evolve, sociable robots, artiﬁcial immune systems that protect
computers from malicious viruses, and virtual creatures that learn, breed, age, and die. Moreover,
biologists can now study evolution in virtual worlds, and medical students and doctors can study
operation mechanisms of various living organs, including the heart with its cells, enabling learning
in ways that are impossible with actual living organs.
The ﬁeld of A-Life consists of a broad range of topics related to the synthesis and simulation of
living systems in the form of self-replicating computer code that allows learning about fundamental
aspects of evolution and their ecological context (Ray, 1992). The enormous advances of computer
capability have led to the creation of an incredible computation and information processing power in
support of the analytical development of biologically inspired capabilities. These advances have led
to biological concepts and systems that are systematically modeled, copied, or adapted (Chapters 4
and 5; Adami, 1998) enabling predictions of what life can be beyond what we know from empirical
research. Some of the topics that are covered under the umbrella of A-Life include origin of life,
evolutionary and ecological dynamics, self-assembly, hierarchy of biological organization, growth
and development, animal and robot behavior, social organization, and cultural evolution.
A-Life is often described as the effort to understand high-level behavior using low-level rules
that are based on the laws of physics. The ﬁeld itself covers the simulation or emulation of living
systems or parts of living systems with the intent to understand their behavior. Another aspect of
this ﬁeld is the attempt to study emergent properties of living populations, usually by making a
simulation of many agents and neglecting the precise details of members of an individual popula-
tion. Adami (1998) approached the ﬁeld of A-Life from physical sciences with life-like entities
taking life as a property of an ensemble of units that share information coded in a physical substrate.
In the presence of noise, each unit manages to keep its entropy signiﬁcantly lower than the maximal
entropy of the ensemble. This information is shared on timescales that exceed the ‘‘natural’’
timescale of decay of the information-bearing substrate by many orders of magnitude. For this
purpose, he introduced the necessity for a synthetic approach and formulated a principle of living
systems based on information and thermodynamic theory.
The founding of the ﬁeld of A-Life is attributed to John Horton Conway, a mathematician from
the University of Cambridge, who in 1968 invented a game called ‘‘The Game of Life’’ (Gardner,
1970). Using a simple system inspired by cell biology, this game exhibits complex, life-like
behavior. The rules involve cell patterns that move across the Life universe, simulating life in the
form of living and dead objects. After playing the game for a while, Conway discovered an
interesting emergence of a pattern of ﬁve cells. He named this stable, repeating cell pattern, glider.
This discovery was followed by R. William Gosper, Jr, who designed a glider gun that ﬁres new
gliders every 30 turns. The glider gun proved that it was possible for a single group of living cells to
expand into the Life universe without limit (Levy, 1984; and Gardner, 1983). Later, using powerful
computers, the study expanded into ‘‘organisms’’ in the Life universe with some starting at random
Introduction to Biomimetics

patterns of cells seeking stable repeating patterns, or patterns that move like the gliders. An
interesting aspect of this game was that the patterns found by computers were discovered rather
than invented.
Some of the beneﬁts of using computers have been the development of the ‘‘genetic program-
ming’’ or ‘‘evolutionary programming’’ (Chapters 4 and 5; Koza, 1992). The ‘‘DNA’’ of genetic
programming consists of a set of equations and operations where the computer software measures
how well each program solves a particular problem. The programs that fare the worst are eliminated
and new strains of program code are bred by recombination, either with or without mutation. The
solutions produced by evolutionary programming emulate the solutions in the real world, and it
may use functions that seemingly have no logical relevance to the problem that is being solved but
it produces effective solutions (Chapters 4 and 5).
1.4
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
According to the American Association for Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI), artiﬁcial intelligence
(AI) is, ‘‘the scientiﬁc understanding of the mechanisms underlying thought and intelligent behav-
ior and their embodiment in machines.’’ AI is a branch of computer science that studies the
computational requirements for such tasks as perception, reasoning, and learning, to allow the
development of systems that perform these capabilities (Russell and Norvig, 2003). AI researchers
are addressing a wide range of problems that include studying the requirements for expert
performance of specialized tasks, explaining behaviors in terms of low-level processes, using
models inspired by the computation of the brain, and explaining them in terms of higher-level
psychological constructs such as plans and goals. The ﬁeld seeks to advance the understanding of
human cognition (Chapter 3), understand the requirements for intelligence in general, and develop
artifacts such as intelligent devices, autonomous agents, and systems that cooperate with humans to
enhance their abilities. The name AI was coined in 1956, though the roots of the ﬁeld may be
attributed to the efforts in World War II to crack enemy codes by capturing human intelligence in a
machine that was called Enigma. This approach eventually led to the 1997 computer success of
IBM’s Deep Blue in beating the world-champion chess player Garry Kasparov. Even though this
was an enormous success for computers, it still does not resemble human intelligence. AI tech-
nologies consist of an increasing number of tools, including artiﬁcial neural networks, expert
systems, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms (Luger, 2001; Chapters 4 and 5).
Advances in AI are allowing analysis of complex nonlinear problems that are beyond the
capability of conventional methods by using such tools as neural networks (i.e., networks of
artiﬁcial brain cells) that can learn and recognize patterns and reach solutions. This is providing
enormous capabilities in the area of robotics including the ability to operate autonomously. One of
the milestones in AI is the development of ‘‘Shakey’’ robot, which was completed by SRI
International’s Artiﬁcial Intelligence Center (AIC) in 1972. This six-foot tall robot (http://www-
clmc.usc.edu/~cs545/Lecture_I.pdf) was named for its erratic and jerky movement. Shakey is the
ﬁrst mobile robot to visually interpret its environment, locate items, navigate around them, and
reason about its actions. Shakey was equipped with a TV camera, a triangulating range ﬁnder,
bumpers, and a wireless video system and it has the capability of autonomous decision making.
The subject of AI is widely covered in the literature (e.g., Luger, 2001; Russell and
Norvig, 2003). Chapter 3 of this book addresses the topic of modeling computers after the processes
in the human brain. One area of AI, which mimics nature, is the swarm intelligence that involves
the study of self-organizing processes in artifacts of nature and humans. Algorithms inspired by
social insect behavior have been proposed to solve difﬁcult computational problems such
as discrete optimization where the ant colony optimization process was followed. Resulting
algorithms were used to solve such problems as vehicle routing and routing in telecommunication
networks.

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

Some of the research areas in the ﬁeld of AI today include web search engines, knowledge
capture, representation and reasoning, reasoning under uncertainty, planning, vision, robotics,
natural language processing, and machine learning. Increasingly, AI components are embedded
in devices and machines that combine case-based reasoning and fuzzy reasoning to operate
automatically or even autonomously. AI systems are used for such tasks as identifying credit
card fraud, pricing airline tickets, conﬁguring products, aiding complex planning tasks, and
advising physicians. AI is also playing an increasing role in corporate knowledge management,
facilitating the capture and reuse of expert knowledge. Intelligent tutoring systems make it possible
to provide students with more personalized attention or even have computers listen and respond to
speech-provided information. Moreover, cognitive models developed by AI tools can suggest
principles for effective support for human learning — guiding the design of educational systems
(Russell and Norvig, 2003).
1.5
NATURE AS A MODEL FOR STRUCTURES AND TOOLS
Biological creatures can build amazing shapes and structures using materials in their surroundings
or the materials that they produce. The shapes and structures produced within a species are very
close copies. They are also quite robust, and support the required function of the structure over the
duration for which it is needed. Such structures include birds’ nests and bees’ honeycombs. Often
the size of a structure can be signiﬁcantly larger than the species that built it, as is the case of the
spider web. One creature that has a highly impressive engineering skill is the beaver, which
constructs dams as its habitat on streams. Other interesting structures include underground tunnels
that gophers and rats build. Birds make their nests from twigs and other materials that are secured
to various stable objects, such as trees, and their nests are durable throughout the bird’s nesting
season. Many nests are hemispherical in the area where the eggs are laid. One may wonder
how birds have the capability to design and produce the correct shape and size of nests that
matches the requirements of allowing eggs that are laid to hatch and grow as chicks until they
leave the nest. The nest’s size even takes into account the potential number of eggs and chicks, in
terms of required space. Even plants offer engineering inspiration. Velcro was invented by
mimicking the concept of seeds that adhere to an animal’s fur, and has led to an enormous impact
in many ﬁelds including clothing and electric-wires strapping. Because of their intuitive charac-
teristics, the use of biologically based rules allows for the making of devices and instruments that
are user-friendly and humans can ﬁgure out how to operate them with minimal instructions.
Examples of devices and structures that were most likely initiated from imitation of biological
models are listed below. These examples illustrate the diverse and incredible number of possibil-
ities that have already been biomimicked.
1.5.1
Constructing Structures from Cells
Using cells to construct structures is the basis of the majority of animals and plants. Adapting this
characteristic offers many advantages including the ability to grow with fault-tolerance and self-
repair. Advances in nano- and micro-technologies are allowing the fabrication of minute elements
that could become the basis for making artiﬁcial cells. Recently, scientists from the University of
Washington, Seattle (Morris et al., 2004) reported on the use of guided and unconstrained self-
assembled silicon circuits to constructed micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)-based cells
that can potentially have this capability. The term self-assembly is deﬁned as the spontaneous
generation of higher-order structures from lower-order elements. Self-assembly is the basis of the
structure for all biological organisms, which exhibit massively parallel fabrication processes that
generate three-dimensional structures with nanoscale precision. As a result, many orders of
magnitude are spanned from the elemental or device-size scale to the ﬁnal system level. This
Introduction to Biomimetics

biologically inspired characteristic is pursued through the use of self-assembly towards developing
an engineering tool to produce structures, devices, and systems. Progress using self-assembly has
allowed for the guided assembly of micro-devices on substrates and self-assembly of large numbers
of parts into two- and three-dimensional arrays or engineered crystals (Figure 1.4). These methods
are expected to allow the integration of devices from different manufacturing processes (CMOS,
MEMS, micro-optics) into one system, addressing some of the main challenges to manufacturing
that are foreseen in 21st century.
1.5.2
Biologically Inspired Mechanisms
Many mechanisms are attributed to a biological source for their inspiration. Some of these
mechanisms include:
1.5.2.1 Digging as the Gopher and the Crab
Since 1998, the author, his Advanced Technologies Group, and engineers from Cybersonics, Inc.,
have been involved with research and development of sampling techniques for future in situ
exploration of planets in the Universe. The investigated techniques are mostly based on the use
of piezoelectric actuators that drive a penetrator at the sonic-frequency range. Using the mechanism
developed, which they called the Ultrasonic/Sonic Driller/Corer (USDC), deep drills were devel-
oped that was inspired by the gopher and sand-crab with respect to penetrating soil and debris
removal (Bar-Cohen et al., 2001). A piezoelectric actuator induces vibration in the form of a
hammering action and the mechanism consists of a bit that has a diameter that is the same or larger
than the actuator. In the device that emulates the gopher, it is lowered into the produced borehole,
cores the medium, breaks and holds the core, and ﬁnally the core is extracted on the surface. This
device can be lowered and raised from the ground surface via cable as shown in Figure 1.5. Analogy
to the biological gopher is that the gopher digs into the ground and removes the loose soil out of the
underground tunnel that it forms, bringing it to the surface.
Another digging device emulates the sand-crab. Like the sand-crab, this device uses mechanical
vibrations on the front surface of the end-effector to travel through particulate media, such as soil
and ground. In this conﬁguration, the device digs and propagates itself through the medium. The
biological crab shakes its body in the sand and thus inserts itself into the sand, as can commonly be

crystals. (Courtesy of Babak Amir Parviz, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.)

seen in sand-crab habitats, such as the beach. While the ultrasonic/sonic gopher was developed to a
prototype device and was demonstrated to perform its intended function, the ultrasonic/sonic crab has
not yet been produced even though its implementation is not expected to pose any major challenges.
1.5.2.2 Inchworm Motors
The biologic inchworm is a caterpillar of a group of moths called Geomeridae, which has six front
legs and four rear legs. Emulating the mobility mechanism of this larva or caterpillar led to the
development of motors and linear actuators that are known as inchworms. These commercially
available motors are driven by piezoelectric actuators (made by Burleigh Instruments) and they are
capable of moving at a speed of about 2 mm/sec with a resolution of nanometers while providing
hundreds of millimeters of travel. The forces produced by these types of motors can reach over 30 N
with zero-backlash and high stability. Their nonmagnetic content offers advantages for applications
in test instruments such as Magnetic Resonance Imagers (MRI). As opposed to biological muscles,
the piezoelectric actuated inchworms are involved with zero-power dissipation when holding
position. One of the limitations of this mechanical inchworm is its inability to operate at extreme
temperatures that are as low as cryogenic temperatures and as high as 2008C. The brakes and
shaft materials have different thermal expansion coefﬁcients, and as a result, at lower temperatures
the shaft–brake ﬁt becomes tighter breaking the ceramic piezoelectric material that is used. At
higher temperatures, on the other hand, the shaft–brake ﬁt gets loose and the motor stops operating.
Eventually, the curie temperature of the piezoelectric material is exceeded and the motor ceases to
work. Using thermally compatible expansion coefﬁcients is broadening the operating range of
temperatures in which inchworms can be used.
Inchworm mechanisms have many conﬁgurations where the unifying drive principle is the use
of two brakes and an extender. An example of the operation of an inchworm is shown in Figure 1.6
where the brakes and clamp are riding linearly on a shaft. These motors perform cyclic steps where
the ﬁrst brake clamps onto the shaft and the extender pushes the second brake forward. Brake no. 2
then clamps the shaft, brake no. 1 is released, and the extender retracts to move brake no. 1 forward.
Another example of such a motor can be a modiﬁcation where the brakes and extender operate
inside a tube. The motor elements perform similar travel procedure as shown in Figure 1.6 while
gripping the wall of the internal diameter of the tube in which the inchworm travels. This type of
motion is performed by geometrid larva worms that move inside the ground. Generally, worms use
their head and tail sections as support, similar to the brake in the inchworm, where the legs grab
the ground or the two ends expand sequentially to operate as a brake. A simpliﬁed view of the
movement of the millipede (different from that described for the inchworm) is illustrated schemat-
ically in Figure 1.7 showing steps that are made while progressing over the surface of objects such
Figure 1.5

as the ground or plants. Other creatures that perform worm-like movement but in a different way
can be seen in the earthworm, maggot, hornworm, ragworm (swimming, walking, burrowing), eel,
geometrid larva, snake, millipede, and centipede.
1.5.2.3 Pumping Mechanisms
Nature uses various pumping mechanisms that are also used in mechanical pumps. The lungs pump
air in and out (tidal pumping) via the use of the diaphragm to enable our breathing. Peristaltic
pumping is one of the most common forms of pumping in biological systems, where liquids are

squeezed in the required direction. Such pumping is common in the digestion system. Pumping via
valves and chambers that change volume is found in human and animal hearts, with expansion and
contraction of chambers. The use of one-way valves is the key to the blood ﬂow inside the veins,
where the pressure is lower.
1.5.2.4 Controlled Adhesion
Controlled adhesion is achieved by many organisms using a highly ﬁbrillated microstructure. The
Hemisphaerota cyanea (a beetle) uses wet adhesion that is based on capillary interaction (wet
adhesion) (Eismer and Aneshansly, 2000). The gecko exhibits remarkable dry adhesion using
van der Waals forces. Even though these forces provide low intrinsic energy of approximately
50 mJ/m2, their effective localized application allows for the remarkable capability (Autumn et al.,
2002). Using this adhesion mechanism, the gecko can race up a polished glass at a speed of
approximately 1 m/sec and support its body weight from a wall with a single toe. Geckos have
millions of 10 to 20 mm long setae, which are microscopic hairs at the bottom of their feet. Each
seta ends with about 1000 pads at the tip (called spatulae) that signiﬁcantly increase the surface
density, and allow getting into close contact with the adhered surface. This capability motivated
efforts to mimic the gecko adhesion mechanism, and some limited success was reported. Re-
searchers like Autumn and Peattie (2003) sought to develop artiﬁcial foot-hair tip model for a dry,
self-cleaning adhesive that works under water and in a vacuum. Their limited success effectively
created a synthetic gecko adhesive that can potentially operate in vacuum areas of clean rooms as
well as outer space.
1.5.2.5 Biological Clock
The body processes are controlled by our biological clock and it is amazing in its precision. It is
critical in assuring the timely execution of the genetic code to form the same characteristics for the
given creatures at the same sequence of occurrence at about the same age. The cicada matures for
17 years, after which it lives for another 1-week period. During this week, all cicadas mate, the
females lay eggs, and then they all die. The hatched cicadas then develop for another 17 years and
these synchronized processes are repeated again.
1.5.3
Biologically Inspired Structures and Parts
Parts and structures also have a biological model of inspiration. Some of these are discussed below.
1.5.3.1 Honeycomb as a Strong, Lightweight Structure
Honeycombs consist of perfect hexagonal cellular structures and they offer optimal packing shape.
For the honeybees, the geometry meets their need for making a structure that provides the
maximum amount of stable containment (honey, larvae) using the minimum amount of material
(Figure 1.8). The honeycomb is, for the same reasons, an ideal structure for the construction of
control surfaces of an aircraft and it can be found in the wing, elevators, tail, the ﬂoor, and many
other parts that need strength and large dimensions while maintaining low weight. An example of a
control surface part of an aircraft with a honeycomb is shown in Figure 1.9.
1.5.3.2 Hand Fan
Historically, hand fans were one of the most important ways of cooling down during the hot
summer months (Figure 1.10). This simple tool used to be made of feathers, which copy the shape

of a bird’s wing or the tail of the male peacock. The advantage of using feathers is their lightweight
structure and their beauty.
1.5.3.3 Fishing Nets and Screens
The ﬁshing net is another of nature’s invention that most likely has been imitated by humans after
observing the spider’s use of its web to catch ﬂies. At an even more basic level, the concept of ﬁber
or string may well have been inspired by the spider. Both the spider web and the ﬁshing net have
structural similarities and carry out the same function of trapping creatures passing by. The spider
uses a sticky material that helps capture the trapped insects by gluing them onto the web, and the
spider knows how to avoid being glued to its own web. Depending on the type of spider, the
distance between the ﬁbers in the web can be as large as several centimeters and as small as
fractions of a millimeter. Beside the use of nets to catch ﬁsh, insects, and animals, humans further
expanded the application of the concept of the net to such tools as bags for carrying and storage of
objects, protective covers against insects, and mounting stored food while allowing aeration. The
screen, mesh, and many other sieving devices that allow separation of various size objects may also
be attributed to the evolution of the net. Also, it is possible to attribute the invention of the net
conﬁguration to many medical supplies including the bandage and the membranes that are used to
cover burns and other wounds.
1.5.3.4 Fins
Unlike the failure to ﬂy by copying the ﬂapping of birds’ wings, the use of ﬁns to enhance
swimming and diving has been highly successful. While it may be arguable whether the ﬁns
were a direct biologically inspired invention, it is common knowledge that swimming creatures
have legs with gossamer (geese, swans, seagulls, seals, frogs, etc.). Imitating the legs of these
creatures offered the inventors of the ﬁns a model that was improved to the point where it resembles
Figure 1.10
The hand fan, which is also produced in a folding form, was probably inspired by the peacock tail and
the ability of this bird to open its tail into a wide screen that is shaken to impress the female.

the leg of the seal and to a lesser extent that of the frog. This similarity to the latter led to the naming
of divers — frogmen, which is clearly a biomimetically inspired name.
1.5.4
Defense and Attack Mechanisms in Biology
A critical aspect of the survival of various species is having effective defense and attack mechan-
isms to protect against predators, catch prey, secure mating, protect the younger generation, procure
and protect food, and other elements that are essential to survival. The following are some of the
biologically inspired mechanisms that were adapted by humans. Further details are discussed more
extensively in Chapter 13.
1.5.4.1 Camouﬂage
The chameleon and the octopus are well known for their capability of changing their body color. The
octopus matches the shape and texture of its surroundings as well as releases ink to completely mask its
location and activity — and yet, the octopus is a color-blind creature (Hanlon et al., 1999). Another
aspect of the octopus’ behavior is its ability to conﬁgure its body to allow traveling through narrow
openings and passages. Theseinclude tubes, which are signiﬁcantly smaller than its normalbodycross-
section. Generally, camouﬂage is not used solely for concealment alone, it also allows the predator
to get close to its prey before charging ahead and capturing it by gaining the element of surprise while
minimizing the response time of the prey. In some creatures, camouﬂage provides deterrence. For
instance, some snakes, which are harmless, clone the appearance of highly poisonous snakes. Further,
some harmless ﬂies camouﬂage themselves with bright colors, pretending that they are wasps.
Minutes after birth, a baby deer is already capable of recognizing danger and taking action of
passive self-defense. Since oftentimes the baby deer is left alone after birth, while the mother goes
off to search for food, the baby has to rely on its ability to hide. It does this by ﬁnding shelter and
taking advantage of basic camouﬂage rules. Without training, it is able to recognize which animals
pose a threat to its life. Furthermore, the baby deer is equipped with the basic skill of taking
advantage of objects in its terrain (e.g., plants), to reduce its body proﬁle by ducking low, and to use
a surrounding background that matches its colors in order to minimize its visibility. These skills,
which are innate in the baby deer, are taught in human military training as camouﬂage methods.

changed to adapt to the local terrain (http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0108/p14s01-stct.htm).
1.5.4.2 Body Armor
The shell is another means of protection that some creatures are equipped with, both on Earth and
under water, and to a certain extent also in some ﬂying insects. Creatures with body armor include
the turtle, snail, and various shelled marine creatures (e.g., mussel, etc.). There are several forms of
shells ranging from shelter that is carried on the back (e.g., snails) to those with full body cover in
16
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

which creatures can completely close the shell as a means of defense against predators. While the
snail is able to emerge from its shell and crawl as it carries the shell on the back (Figure 1.11), the
turtle lives inside its ‘‘body armor’’ and is able to use its legs for mobility when it is safe and hide its
legs and head when it fears danger. The turtle was probably a good model for human imitation in
terms of self-defense. The idea of body protection was adapted by humans many thousands of years
ago in the form of hand-carried shields that allowed for defense against sharp objects, such as knives
and swords. As the capability to process metals improved, humans developed better weapons to
overcome the shield and therefore forced the need for better body armor in order to provide cover
for the whole body. The armor that knights wore for defense during the Middle Ages provided
metal shield from head to toe. Figure 1.12 shows such an armor for the upper part of the body.
In Japan, a more ﬂexible armor was produced that consisted of thin metal strips connected with
ﬂexible leather bands. Relying on such protection led to defeat when faced against soldiers with
riﬂes. As weapon technology in the West evolved, efforts were made to reduce the use of armor on
individual soldiers for the sake of increased speed and maneuverability, as well as to lower the cost
of fabrication and operation. In parallel, armored vehicles, which included tanks providing mobile
shield and weaponry, with both defense and offense capabilities were developed. In nature, the use
of shell for body protection is limited mostly to slow moving creatures and nearly all of them are
plant-eaters.
1.5.4.3 Hooks, Pins, Sting, Syringe, Barb, and the Spear
Most of us have experienced at least once in our lifetime the pain of being hurt by a prick from
plants — sometimes from something as popular and beautiful as the rose bush. Such experience can

17

also occur when interacting with certain creatures, such as the bee. In the case of the bee, the stinger
is left in the penetrated area and does not come out because of its spear shape. Humans adapted and
evolved the concept of sharp penetrators in order to create many tools for applications in medicine,
sports, and weaponry. These tools include the syringe, spears, ﬁshing hooks, stings, barbs, and
many others. Once penetrated, the hook and barb section on the head of a harpoon or an arrow
makes it difﬁcult to remove the weapon from the body of ﬁsh, animal, or human being.
1.5.4.4 Decoy
The use of decoy is as ancient as the lizard’s use of its tail as a method to distract the attention of
predators. The lizard autotomizes its tail and the tail moves rapidly, diverting the attention of the
suspected predator while the lizard escapes to safety. This method is quite critical to lizard’s
survival and the tail grows back again without leaving a scar. This capability is not only a great
Figure 1.12
An armor used as a body protection for knights can be viewed as mimicking the turtle’s hard-shell
body cover.
18
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

model for military strategies but also offers a model for potential healing of maimed parts of the
human body. Success in adapting this capability could help people with disabilities the possibility
of regrowing amputated or maimed parts of their body.
1.5.5
Artiﬁcial Organs
It is increasingly common to augment body organs with artiﬁcial substitutes. This is the result of
signiﬁcant advances in materials that are biocompatible, powerful electronics, and efﬁcient mini-
ature actuators. An artiﬁcial hand is shown in Figure 1.13 where a mechanism was designed to
allow control of the ﬁngers using a hand that matches the appearance of a human real hand.
Artiﬁcial organs already include the heart, lung, kidney, liver, hip, and others (Chapter 18). Smart
limbs, also known as Cyborgs, are also increasingly being developed with various degrees of
sophistication and operation similar to the biological model. Moreover, the possibility of an
artiﬁcial vision allowing a blind person to see is another growing reality, and a description of the
state of the art as well as the expected future of this technology is provided in Chapter 17.
1.6
MATERIALS AND PROCESSES IN BIOLOGY
The body is a chemical laboratory that processes chemicals acquired from nature and turns them to
energy, construction materials, waste, and various multifunctional structures (Mann, 1995). Natural
materials have been well recognized by humans as sources of food, clothing, comfort, and so on.
These include fur, leather, honey, wax, milk, and silk (see Chapter 14). Even though some of the
creatures and insects that produce materials are relatively small, they can produce quantities of
materials that are sufﬁcient to meet human consumption on a scale of mass production (e.g., honey,
silk, and wool). The use of natural materials can be traced back to thousands of years. Silk, which is
produced to protect the cocoon of the silkmoth, has great properties that include beauty, strength,
and durability. These advantages are well recognized by humans and the need to make them in any
desired quantity has led to the production of artiﬁcial versions and imitations. Some of the
fascinating capabilities of natural materials include self-healing, self-replication, reconﬁgurability,
chemical balance, and multifunctionality. Many man-made materials are processed by heating and

Museum in Washington, DC.)
Introduction to Biomimetics
19

pressurizing, and this is in contrast to nature which uses ambient conditions. Materials, such as
bone, collagen, or silk, are made inside the organism’s body without the harsh treatment that is used
to make our materials. The fabrication of biologically derived materials produces minimum waste
and no pollution, where the result is biodegradable, and can be recycled by nature. Learning how to
process such materials can make our material choices greater, and improve our ability to create
recyclable materials that can better protect the environment. There are also studies that are
improving prosthetics, which include hips, teeth, structural support of bones, and others. A brief
description of structural materials that are made by certain insects and birds is given in this section,
whereas Chapters 12 and 14 cover in greater detail the topics of biological materials and their
multifunctional characteristics.
1.6.1
Spider Web — Strong Fibers
One of biology’s best ‘‘manufacturing engineers’’ with an incredibly effective material-fabrication
capability is the spider. It fabricates the web (Figure 1.14) to make a very strong, insoluble,
continuous lightweight ﬁber, and the web is resistant to rain, wind, and sunlight. It is made of
very ﬁne ﬁbers that are barely visible allowing it to serve its function as an insect trap. The web can
carry signiﬁcant amount of water droplets from fog, dew, or rain thus making it visible as shown in
Figure 1.14. The web structure in the photograph has quite an interesting geometry. It reveals the
Figure 1.14 (See color insert)
The spider constructs an amazing web made of silk material that for a given
weight is ﬁve times stronger than steel.
20
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

spokes, the length, and density of sticky spiral material for catching bugs. The segments of the
photographed web are normally straight, but are seen curved in this ﬁgure due to the weight of
the accumulated droplets. The net is sufﬁciently strong to survive this increased load without
collapsing.
The spider generates the ﬁber while at the same time hanging on to it as it emerges cured and
ﬂawless from its body. The web is generated at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure. The
spider has sufﬁcient supply of raw materials for its silk to span great distances. It is common to see
webs spun in various shapes (including ﬂat) between distant trees, and the web is amazingly large
compared to the size of the spider. Another interesting aspect of the spider web is the fact that it is a
sticky material intended to catch prey, but the spider itself is able to move freely on it without being
trapped.
The silk that is produced by a spider is far superior in toughness and elasticity to Kevlar1, which
is widely used as one of the leading materials in bullet proof vests, aerospace structures, and other
applications where there is a need for strong lightweight ﬁbers. Though produced in water, at room
temperature and pressure, spider’s silk is much stronger than steel. The tensile strength of the
radial threads of spider silk is 1154 MPa, while steel is 400 MPa (Vogel, 2003). Spiders eat ﬂies and
digest them to produce the silk that comes out from their back ends, and spool the silk as it is
produced while preparing a web for trapping insects. This web is designed to catch insects that cross
the net and get stuck due to its stickiness and complexity. While the net is effective in catching
insects, the spider is able to maneuver on it without the risk of being caught in its own trap. Recent
progress in nano-technology reveals a promise for making ﬁbers that are ﬁne, continuous, and
enormously strong. For this purpose, an electrospinning technique was developed (Dzenis, 2004)
that allows producing 2-mm diameter ﬁbers from polymer solutions and melts in high electric
ﬁelds. The resulting nano-ﬁbers were found to be relatively uniform without requiring extensive
puriﬁcation.
1.6.2
Honeybee as a Multiple Materials Producer
Another ‘‘material manufacturing engineer’’ found in nature is the honeybee. This insect can make
materials in volumes that far exceed the individual bee’s size. Bees are well known for making
honey from the nectar that they collect from ﬂowers. They also produce honeycomb from wax.
Historically, candles were made using this beeswax, but with the advent of the petroleum industry,
candles are now mostly made from parafﬁn wax. Another aspect of honeybee is that their bodies
produce a poison that causes great pain, which is injected, through a stinger, into the body of any
intruder who is perceived as a threat to the bee’s colony.
1.6.3
Swallow as a Clay and Composite Materials Producer
The swallow makes its nest from mud and its own spit forming a composite structure that is strong.
The nest is shaped to ﬁt the area onto which it is built. The swallow builds its nest under roofs and
other shelters that provide both protection and concealment. Figure 1.15 is a photograph of two
nests of swallow. A ﬂock of swallows have gathered next to the nests. While the two nests are
different in shape they have similar characteristics and they both provided sufﬁcient room for the
chicks to hatch and reach maturity. It is interesting to note that the birds in the photograph attach
themselves to the wall carrying their body weight on their claws, which secure them comfortably to
the stucco paint on the wall.
1.6.4
Fluorescence Materials in Fireﬂies and Road Signs
Fluorescence materials can be found in quite a few living species and these visible light-emitting
materials can be divided into two types:
Introduction to Biomimetics
21

(a)
bioluminescence — a voluntary or involuntary light emission, which results from a chemical
reaction;
(b)
ﬂuorescence — emission of light under ultraviolet illumination.
Bioluminescence can be found in various beetles (e.g., ﬁreﬂy), marine creatures (e.g., Pyrocystis
lunula, Gonyaulax polyedra, and squids), as well as certain bacteria, and mushrooms. Biolumin-
escence materials are used to attract females as in the case of the American ﬁreﬂy (Lloyd, 1984).
The male ﬁreﬂy ﬂashes its light in order to ‘‘declare’’ its presence and identity, and to attract
females of its own species (Lloyd, 1966). Another example for bioluminescence is the glow-worm,
a type of beetle (Noctiluca), whose wingless female glows in the dark. Bioluminescence is also used
as a deception method, where the Photuris females mimic the ﬂashing rate of hetero-speciﬁc males
and eat them (Lloyd, 1980).
1.6.5
Impact Sensitive Paint Mimicking Bruised Skin
Our skin is sensitive to impact leading to purple color marks in areas of the skin that is hit. This
bruise mark indicates the fact that the speciﬁc area has suffered an impact. This idea inspired
researchers at the South West Research Institute in the mid-1980s (Light et al., 1988) to develop a
surface coating as a nondestructive indicator of impact damage in composite materials. The need
for such an indicator rose as the use of composite material increased to a level where structures that
are critical to the safety of aircraft started to be introduced into military and commercial aircraft.

straws. These nests were built under the author’s roof (July 2004).
22
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

U.S. Air Force studies showed that these materials are sensitive to impact; a loss of about 80% in the
compression static strength was measured when an impact causes an easy-to-see damage to the
surface, whereas a loss of 65% when the damage is barely visible (Bar-Cohen, 2000). In order to
develop an impact damage indicator, paint was mixed with an encapsulated dye and developer, and
was applied to the surface of composite panels. The micro-capsules that were used had a diameter
of 1 to 10 mm and in this size they were easy to apply using conventional methods like spraying to
increase the practicality of this paint. Tests have shown the feasibility of this concept and the paint
was effective in indicating the location and intensity of the impact, where the larger the impacted
area, the larger the indication that appeared.
1.6.6
Mimicking Sea Creatures with Controlled Stiffness Capability
Certain sea creatures, such as the sea cucumbers, are capable of controlling the tensile properties of
their connective tissues by regulating the stress transfer between collagen ﬁbrils (Trotter et al.,
2000; http://www.biochemsoctrans.org/bst/028/0357/0280357.pdf). Trotter et al. (2000) sought
to design a synthetic analog with similarly reversible properties, and have been able to demonstrate
a pair of synthetic molecules that selectively and reversibly associate with one another under
controlled physiological conditions.
1.6.7
Biology as a Source for Unique Properties and Intelligent Characteristics
Materials that are made by animals offer capabilities and properties that are often far superior to any
human-made imitations. These material properties include hardness, fracture resistance, and light-
weight — as can be found in pearls and shells of various marine species, including the abalone.
There are also many body parts (e.g., teeth and eye cornea) that are organized as layered assemblies,
which are now emulated by methods such as self-assembly and ink-jet printing. Smart materials
are increasingly evolving in various forms, with self-sensing and reaction capabilities that
cause them to stretch and contract in response to heat, light, and chemical changes. Another aspect
of biomaterials is self-healing, which is increasingly being adapted to polymer and composite
materials.
1.6.8
Multifunctional Materials
Nature has made great efforts to use its resources effectively, and besides the use of power in
efﬁcient ways including its recycling, nature also assigned multifunctions to its materials and
structures. For example, our skin encases blood and other parts of our body, supports the regulation
of body temperature, has self-healing capability as well as many other functions. Also, our bones
provide the required body stiffness to support it allowing us not only to stand, walk, and conduct
various critical mobility functions, but it also produces our blood in the bone marrow. The use of
materials that perform multiple tasks allowed nature to make its creatures with a lower body weight.
The concepts of multifunctional materials and structures are being studied by many researchers and
engineers (see more details in Chapter 12) and has been the subject of a DAPRA program at the end
of the 1990s. Increasingly efforts are made to emulate this characteristic, where multiple disciplines
are used, for example, applied mechanics (elasticity or plasticity, fracture mechanics, aerodynam-
ics), materials sciences (metallurgy, composites, polymers), electronics (sensors, actuators, con-
trols), photonics (ﬁber optics), and manufacturing (micro- or macro-structure processing).
1.6.9
Biomimetic Processes
There are many biomimetic processes that were learned from studying the activity of the body
of living creatures. The imitation of biological processes ranges from operations at the level of
Introduction to Biomimetics
23

cells to the scale of the full body. Imitated processes, including artiﬁcial synthesis of certain
vitamins and antibiotics, have been in use for many years. More recently, biomimetics have been
used to design navigational systems, data converters, mathematical algorithms (Chapters 4
and 5), and diffusion processes. The neural network (part of the ﬁeld of AI that was covered
earlier) is a hypothetical biomimetic computer that works by making associations and guesses, and
that can learn from its own mistakes. Examples of biomimetic processes are described throughout
this book.
1.7
BIO-SENSORS
Living creatures are equipped with a sensory system, which provides input to the central nervous
system about the environment around and within their body and the muscles are commanded to
action after analysis of the received information (Hughes, 1999). Biological sensory systems are
extremely sensitive and limited only by quantum effects (Chapter 11; Bill Bialek, 1987). This
sensory network is increasingly imitated, where we ﬁnd our surroundings ﬁlled with sensors. Such
sensors are monitoring our property to protect it from intruders; releasing soap and water when
washing our hands; releasing hot air or paper towels to dry our hands; tracking our driving speed;
observing our driving through intersections that are monitored by trafﬁc lights; as well as
performing many other tasks that we accept as part of our day-to-day lives.
Our cars sense
when we close the doors, whether there is sufﬁcient air in the tires, charge in the battery and oil in
the engine, and if all the key functions are operating properly. Sensors also control the ﬂow of
gasoline to the ignition system in our cars to optimize gas consumption. Similar to the ability of
our body to monitor the temperature and keep it within healthy acceptable limits, our habitats,
working, and shopping areas have environment control to provide us with comfortable temper-
atures. These examples are only a small number of the types of sensors that are used in our
surroundings and in the instruments that we use today. Pressure, temperature, optical, and
acoustical sensors are widely in use and efforts are continuously made to improve their sensing
capability and reduce their size and required power while mimicking ideas from biology. These
include adapting principles from the eyes to camera, from the whiskers of rodents to sensors for
collision avoidance, and from bats to acoustic detectors that imitate their sonar. Speciﬁc examples
of biomimicked sensors are described below.
1.7.1
Miniature Sensors in Biomimetic Robots
The integration of sensors into mobile systems is critical for their operation, as it is necessary to
provide closed-loop feedback to accomplish mobility tasks and other dynamic functions. Emulat-
ing the dimensions, density, integration, and distribution of sensors in the human ﬁnger will
require signiﬁcant advancements in such ﬁelds as MEMS and nano-electro-mechanical systems
(NEMS). While currently the packing density of sensors per unit surface using MEMS tech-
nology is about 1 to 10 sensors/mm2 there is still a long way to go before reaching the density
level of hundreds of sensors/mm2 of the skin area of the ﬁngertips. Combining the equivalence of
soft skin and integrated sensors is a desired biomimetic development goal. An array of multiple
types of sensors will need to be used to provide critical, detailed data about the environment and
the performance of the various elements of mobile system. It is also highly desirable to see the
development of miniature vision and sound receivers with real-time image and voice recognition
allowing rapid response to the environment in a manner akin to living creatures. Moreover, there
is increasing need for soft sensors that can support the development of electroactive polymers
(EAP) as artiﬁcial muscles (Chapter 10). These materials have functional similarities to biological
muscles and the use of such sensors as strain gauges is not effective because of the constraining
effect that results from the rigidity of the widely used gauges.

1.7.2
MEMS-Based Flow Detector Mimicking Hair Cells with Cilium
On the micron-scale level the monitoring of air (Friedel and Barth, 1997) and water ﬂow (Bond,
1996) in insects and in ﬁsh is by clusters of hair cells. These hair cells consist of cilia that are
attached to nerve cells, and they sense the bending action that results from the ﬂow. The displace-
ment induces an output response from the attached nerve cell. These hair cell sensors were
biomimicked to produce two types of artiﬁcial hair cell sensors (Ozaki et al., 2000; Chen et al.,
2003b). The ﬁrst type has a cantilever or paddle that is parallel to the substrate, and is sensitive to
ﬂow and forces that act normal to the substrate (Ozaki et al., 2000). The second type has a cantilever
that is perpendicular to the substrate, where the early types were made of silicon which is brittle.
Improvement has been developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where robust
polymer-based sensor was demonstrated (Chen et al., 2003a). A schematic and graphic view of the
developed hair cell is shown in Figure 1.16.
1.7.3
Collision Avoidance Using Whiskers
Another biologically inspired sensor that was adapted is the use of the whisker in various rodents.
The whiskers of rats are extremely sensitive helping it avoid collision with obstacles and ﬁnding
food. Emulating whiskers offers signiﬁcant advantages to biologically inspired robots and such
sensors have already been used in various commercially available robots (Gravagne et al., 2001),
such as the BIOBbug toys (Hrynkiw and Tilden, 2002). The BIOBbug is an insect-like toy that
operates as a swarm and avoids collision between each other as well as other objects.
1.7.4
Emulating Bats’ Acoustic Sensor
The bat can move its ears in all directions, localize sound sources, and avoid obstacles, all while
ﬂying at relatively high speed. Ear shapes are different in different bats, indicating that there is no
optimal shape, and that each bat species evolved its own biological solution. It is believed that the
ear creates interference that is processed by the brain. The bat ear has been the subject of numerous
studies including recent efforts to use it to navigate robots (Peremans and Muller, 2003; Muller and
Hallam, 2004). The directivity patterns for frequencies from 25 to 75 kHz were studied and the ears
of various bats were tested using x-ray to study the internal structure and how sound interacts with
the ear. A rapid prototyping method was made to produce pinna-shapes, assuming that the make-up
material is not a critical issue because of the large mismatch with air. To convert sound to electric

U.S. signals piezoelectric foils were used with an electro-mechanical conversion factor, d33,
ranging from 250 pC/N to 400 pC/N (Neugschwandtner et al., 2001). To demonstrate the simulation
of the bat capability the developed sensors were used to navigate robots. Current efforts are focused
on classifying landmarks, navigation in natural environments, making use of body movement, and
echo interpretation (Muller and Hallam, 2004).
1.7.5
Acoustic and Elastic Wave Sensors
Certain animal species are equipped with the ability to sense acoustic or elastic waves at great
distances. The elephant can rock its foot and emit vibrations that travel through the ground and are
felt and recognized by other elephants at a distance of several kilometers. The whale emits hyper-
low frequency sound that travels over great distances in the ocean and can be detected and identiﬁed
by other whales. Equivalent detectors made by humans include accelerometers used to detect
earthquakes and the sonar used in submarines. However, biological capability is still far superior
in terms of sensitivity, spectral response, and evaluation capability than any man-made detection
instrument.
1.7.6
Fire Monitoring
The jewel beetle (Melanophila) lays its eggs in the bark of freshly burned trees using its ability to
detect forest ﬁres from a distance of about 80 km (http://www.uni-bonn.de). The sensory organ that
is used for this is located on the underside of the beetle, and consists of a pit that contains a large
number of receptors that are extremely responsive to the infrared (IR) radiation created by a forest
ﬁre. Recently, zoologists at the University of Bonn have been trying to imitate this sensory
capability. The study by Schmitz and Trenner (2003) led to the development of a sensor that is
sensitive to infrared and automatically monitors large forest areas to trigger an early warning in the
event of ﬁre. As biological imitation of the beetle’s cuticulas sensory organ, a polyethylene platelet
was developed, which absorbs thermal radiation with wavelength of 3 mm, which is the typical
radiation emitted by ﬁerce force ﬁres. This sensor was found to be two orders of magnitude more
sensitive than commercially available IR sensors. This new sensor is expected to be produced at
lower cost than commercial detectors and efforts to further improve its sensitivity are currently
underway.
1.7.7
Sense of Smell and Artiﬁcial Nose
The topic of smell sensing has reached a level of interest and progress that led in 2004, to the Nobel
Prize Award given to the researchers Buck and Axel (1991). The sense of smell is our analyzer
of chemicals of airborne molecules allowing us to determine presence of danger, hazardous
chemicals as well as gives us the enjoyment of good food and other pleasant odors. Using receptors
in our nose we continuously examine the content of the air we breathe, where the signals are sent
through stations called glomeruli that are located in the brain’s olfactory bulb. From there, the
signals are sent to the brain where patterns of smell memories are formed and compared with
previous ‘‘records.’’ The sense of smell alerts us of such danger as smoke from ﬁre, leakage of
dangerous gases, as well as informs us of other relevant information, such as the presence of food or
even perfume from other individuals. The detectable chemicals need to be sufﬁciently small to be
volatile so that they can be vaporized, reach the nose, and then dissolve in the mucus. It is estimated
that our nose can distinguish between as many as 10,000 different smells.
Imitating the nose’s sensing capability offers important potential applications, and efforts to make
such sensors have been explored since the mid-1980s. There are several devices that have been built
and tested emulating the nose including some that use chemical sensor array (Bartlett and Gardner,
26
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

1999; Dickinson et al., 1998; Nagle, 1998; www.cyranosciences.com). The technology is now at
a level where electronic noses are commercially available, and they have been applied to environ-
mental monitoring and quality control in such ﬁelds as food processing. Generally, an electronic
nose is an array of weakly speciﬁc chemical sensors, controlled and analyzed electronically,
mimicking the action of the mammalian nose by recognizing patterns of response to vapors. Unlike
most existing chemical sensors, which are designed to detect speciﬁc chemical compounds,
the sensors in an electronic nose are not speciﬁc to any one compound, but have overlapping
responses. Gases and gas mixtures can be identiﬁed by the pattern of the responses of the sensors
in the array.
Chemical sensors are made from several different materials that act by several different
mechanisms. Conducting polymers such as polyanilines or polypyrroles can be used as the basis
for a conductometric sensor, where change at the sensor is read as change in resistance. The ability
of conducting polymers to detect a wide variety of compounds can be extended by mixing other
polymers with the conductor (Freund and Lewis, 1995). An electronic nose that uses polymers as
the basis of the chemical sensors is under development at JPL for such applications as event
monitoring on the International Space Station. The polymer-based sensors used in the JPL ENose
were developed at Caltech (Lonergan et al., 1996). They are insulating polymers, which have been
loaded with a conductive material such as carbon black. A thin ﬁlm of the polymer or conductor
composite absorbs vapor molecules into the matrix, and the matrix changes shape and the relative
orientation of the conductive particles. This change results in a change in resistance, which is used
to form the pattern of response. The magnitude of the response can be related to the concentration of
vapor, and mixtures of a few compounds can be deconvoluted. The library of compound patterns
that the ENose contains depends on the particular space in which it is used and the hazards of that
space. New compounds can be added to the library as the device is exposed to them. ENoses in
different spaces can be equipped with different polymers in the array, and therefore, a different
library. The polymers for an array are selected by molecular structure of the polymer and the target
compounds for that array.
1.7.8
Sense of Taste and Artiﬁcial Tongue
The sense of taste is another chemical analyzer in biology; it examines dissolved molecules and
ions and it uses clusters of receptor cells in the taste buds (Craven and Gardner, 1996). Each taste
bud has a pore that opens out onto the surface of the tongue enabling molecules and ions taken into
the mouth to reach into the receptor cells. Generally, there are ﬁve primary taste sensations
including: salty, sour, sweet, bitter, and umami. A single taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste cells
representing all ﬁve taste sensations. Each taste cell has receptors on its apical surface and these are
transmembrane proteins that bind to the molecules and ions that give rise to the ﬁve taste sensations.
Several receptor cells are connected through a synapse to a sensory neuron and from there to the
back of the brain, where each sensory neuron responds best to one of the taste sensations (http://
users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/T/Taste.html).
Similar to the electronic nose, researchers explored the development of an electronic tongue that
mimics the biological sensory capability (Vlasov and Legin, 1998; Krantz-Ruckler et al., 2001;
http://csrg.ch.pw.edu.pl/prepapers/pciosek/etong.html). Generally, the electronic tongue is an auto-
matic system for analysis and recognition (classiﬁcation) of liquids using nonspeciﬁc sensors
arrays, data acquisition elements, and analytical tools. The result of E-tongue tests can be the
identiﬁcation of the sample, an estimation of its concentration or its characteristic properties. Using
this technology allows overcoming the limitations of human sensing including individual variabil-
ity, inability to conduct online monitoring, subjectivity, adaptation, infections, harmful exposure
to hazardous compounds, and effect of mental state. The artiﬁcial taste sensors that mimic the
olfactory system consist of various types of sensors including potentiometric sensors, conductivity
measurements, voltamperommetry, and optical sensors. Various techniques and methods can be
Introduction to Biomimetics
27

used separately or together to perform the recognition of the samples, where after completing a
measurement, procedure signals are transformed by a preprocessing block. The results are then
analyzed by various pattern recognition blocks consisting of AI processes (e.g., Cluster Analysis or
Artiﬁcial Neural Network). The performance of electronic tongues depends on the quality of
functioning of its pattern recognition block.
E-tongues are increasingly being used in such applications as monitoring food taste and
quality, noninvasive diagnostics (patient’s breath, analysis of urine, sweat, and skin odor), search-
ing for chemical or biological weapon, drugs, and explosives, as well as environmental pollution
monitoring.

ROBOTICS EMULATING BIOLOGY
The introduction of the wheel has been one of the most important human inventions — allowing
humans to traverse great distances and perform tasks that would have been otherwise impossible
within the lifetime of a single human being. While wheel-locomotion mechanisms allow reaching
great distances and speeds, wheeled vehicles are subject to great limitations with regard to
traversing complex terrain with obstacles. Obviously, legged creatures can perform numerous
functions that are far beyond the capability of an automobile. Producing legged-robots is increas-
ingly becoming an objective for robotic developers and using such robots for space applications is
currently under consideration. Also, operating robots as colonies or ﬂocks is a growing area of
robotic research.
Bio-inspired mechanisms are not only based on legs — since wind is blown throughout Mars,
producing a spacecraft that imitates the tumbleweed offers an attractive option. The tumbleweed
inspired the design of a mobility system that uses wind rather than a power-consuming mechanism.
As shown in Figure 1.17, the tumbleweed has inspired a futuristic lander that is being investigated
as a potential vehicle for mobility on Mars.
Industry is increasingly beneﬁted from advancement in robotics and automation that are
biologically inspired (Bar-Cohen, 2000; Bar-Cohen and Breazeal, 2003). Crawlers with complex-
shaped legs and various manipulation devices are commonly used to perform a variety of non-
destructive evaluation (NDE) tasks. At JPL, a multifunctional automated crawling system (MACS)
was developed to simplify scanning of aircraft structures in ﬁeld conditions (Figure 1.18). MACS
employs two sets of legs to support mobility and one set that allows for rotation of its platform.
MACS was designed to perform scanning by effectively ‘‘walking’’ on the aircraft fuselage while

adhering to it via suction cups. This locomotive method mimics the mechanism that ﬂies use
to walk upside down on ceilings. Other forms of mobility on objects using methods of adhesion
include magnetic wheels. The author and his coinvestigator (Bar-Cohen and Joffe, 1997) conceived
a rover that can operate on ships and submarines using magnetic wheels. Another legged robot
is the JPL’s STAR that has four legs and can perform multiple functions, including grabbing
objects (Figure 1.19) as well as climbing rocks with the aid of the USDC (Bar-Cohen et al., 1999;
Bar-Cohen and Sherrit, 2003; Badescu et al., 2005) on each leg. The USDC is used for this purpose
since it requires a relatively low axial force to drill into hard objects. The JPL’s legged robots
are developed for potential operation in future planetary mission, where a Lemur class
robot will be able to autonomously negotiate its way through unknown terrain that is ﬁlled with
obstacles.
Creating robots that mimic the shape and performance of biological creatures has always been a
highly desirable engineering objective. Searching the Internet using the keyword robot would point

out many links to research and development projects that are involved with such robots. The
entertainment and toy industries have greatly beneﬁted from advancement in this technology.
Increasingly, robots are used in movies where creatures are shown to exhibit realistic behavior.
The capabilities demonstrated even include creatures that are no longer in existence like the
dinosaurs in the movie Jurassic Park.
As mentioned earlier, visits to toy stores, show how far technology has progressed in making
inexpensive toys that imitate biology. Such store displays include frogs swimming in a ﬁsh bowl
and dogs walking back and forth. Operating robots that emulate the functions and performance of
humans or animals use capabilities of actuators and mechanisms that depend on state-of-the-art
technology. Upper-end robots and toys are becoming increasingly sophisticated, allowing them to
walk and talk and some robots can be operated autonomously or can be remotely reprogrammed to
change its characteristic behavior. Some of the toys and robots can even display expressions and
exhibit behaviors similar to humans and animals. An example of such a robot is Kismet, which can
express and react to human expressions facially and verbally (Bar-Cohen and Breazeal, 2003). This
expression is made as a function of the level of expression that is being emulated or programmed
to perform. As this technology evolves, it is likely that in the future, human-like robots may be
developed to perform tasks without the possibility of human errors, needing a break, being
distracted, or getting tired. Moreover, these robots may be programmed to display happiness,
sorrow, etc.
One may even see a day when such robots could become human companions and advisors. At
such point, the population of biomimetic robots will increase to possibly become a household
‘‘tool’’ just like personal computers. With the increase in availability of robots as property there will
arise a need to protect them as valuables possibly even requiring to equip them with self-defense.
Such a capability will raise major concerns related to the limits that will be allowed with regard to
their interaction with humans. Another potential issue that may arise with the evolution of such
robots is the potential copying of humans forming the equivalence of cloning. In contrast to the

genetic procedure which can take many years to grow, a duplicate of the human without ability to
control the outcome, the robotic version can potentially be rapidly produced and be programmed to
emulate the behavior and response of the original person. Aspects of this mimicking will need to be
addressed by future generations as the potential unlawful possibilities that may become possible
could pose major concerns to law-enforcement agencies.
1.8.1
Artiﬁcial Muscles
Polymers that can be stimulated to change shape and size have been known for years. The
functional similarity of such polymers led to their being named artiﬁcial muscles. The activation
mechanism for such polymers includes electric, chemical, pneumatic, optical, and magnetic.
Electrical excitation is one of the most attractive stimulators that can produce elastic deformation
in polymers. The convenience and the practicality of electrical stimulation, as well as the improved
capabilities, make the EAP one of the most attractive among the activatable polymers (Bar-Cohen,
2001, 2004; Chapter 10).
Generally, EAP materials can be divided into two major categories based on their activation
mechanism: electronic and ionic. Most electronic polymers (electrostrictive, electrostatic, piezo-
electric, and ferroelectric) require high activation ﬁelds (>150 V/mm) close to the breakdown level.
However, they can be made to hold the induced displacement under activation of a DC voltage,
allowing them to be considered for robotic applications. These materials have a faster response, a
greater mechanical energy density, and they can be operated in air. In contrast, ionic EAP materials
(gels, IPMC, conductive polymers, and carbon nanotubes) require drive voltages as low as 1 to 5 V,
and produce signiﬁcant bending. However, bending actuators have relatively limited applications
for mechanically demanding tasks due to the low force or torque that can be induced. Also, with
some exceptions, these materials require maintaining their wetness and when containing water they
suffer electrolysis with irreversible effects when they are subjected to voltages above 1.23 V.
Except for conductive polymers, it is difﬁcult to sustain DC-induced displacements.
Unfortunately, EAP-based actuators are still exhibiting low force below their efﬁciency limits,
are not robust, and are not available as commercial materials for practical application consider-
ations. Each of the known materials requires adequate attention to the associated unique properties
and constraints. In order to be able to take these materials from the development phase to use as
effective actuators, there is a need to have an established EAP infrastructure. Effectively addressing
the requirements of the EAP infrastructure involves developing its science and engineering basis,
namely, having an adequate understanding of EAP materials’ behavior, as well as processing and
characterization techniques. Enhancement of the actuation force requires understanding the basic
principles, computational chemistry models, comprehensive material science, electro-mechanical
analysis, and improved material processing techniques. Efforts are on for a better understanding
of the parameters that control the EAP electroactivation force and deformation. The processes of
synthesizing, fabricating, electroding, shaping, and handling are being established and reﬁned to
maximize the EAP materials actuation capability and robustness. In addition, methods of reliably
characterizing the response of these materials are being developed. This effort also includes the
establishment of a database with documented material properties in order to support design
engineers who are considering the use of these materials. Various conﬁgurations of EAP actuators
and sensors are being modeled to produce an arsenal of effective, smart EAP-driven systems. The
development of the infrastructure is multidisciplinary, and requires international collaboration and
these efforts are currently underway worldwide.
In 1999, the author challenged the world’s research and engineering community to develop a
robotic arm that is actuated by artiﬁcial muscles (moniker for EAP) to win a wrestling match
against a human opponent. The objectives of the match are to promote advances in making EAP
actuators that are superior in performance to the performance of human muscles. Also, it is sought
to increase the worldwide visibility and recognition of EAP materials, attract interest among

potential sponsors and users, and lead to general public awareness since it is hoped that they will be
the end users and beneﬁciaries in many areas including medical, commercial, and military. The ﬁrst
arm-wrestling competition with humans was held against a 17-year-old girl on March 7, 2005 and
the girl won against three robotic arms that participated. Even though the arms did not beat the
challenge, one of the arms was able to hold against the girl for 26 sec, and this is an important
milestone.
1.8.2
Aerodynamic and Hydrodynamic Mobility
Judging from the number of ﬂying insects, birds, and marine creatures, nature has ‘‘experimented’’
extensively with aerodynamics and hydrodynamics. There are several aspects that deserve atten-
tion. For instance, birds can catch ﬁsh underwater with their eyes closed. They are able to catch ﬁsh
by taking into account the refraction-effect, which creates an illusion as to the location of the ﬁsh.
Birds and various mammal predators take into account the vector trajectory of the escaping prey, as
in the case of hunting a running rabbit or deer. These trajectories are increasingly the capability of
military weapons allowing tanks to destroy a moving target while they are moving too. Sophisti-
cated capabilities are used to track the moving target and either adjust the direction in ﬂight or aim
upon launch using high speed missiles or bullets.
The ability of the dragonﬂy to maneuver at high speed is another aspect of ﬂying that
considerably inspired humans. Using a liquid-ﬁlled sac that surrounds its cardiac system, the
dragonﬂy adjusts the effects of high G on its body during its ﬂight and incredible maneuvers.
G represents unit of gravitational force on Earth where high G is many multiples of one G. This
technique inspired a mechanism that allows pilots to ﬂy at high mach speed with signiﬁcantly lower
effects on the ability of the pilot to stay coherent. A liquid-ﬁlled, anti-G suit was developed by Life
Support Systems, a Swiss company, and the suit is called ‘‘Libelle,’’ which means in German
‘‘dragonﬂy’’ (http://www.airpower.at/news01/0625_libelle/libelle3.htm). The Libelle suit promises
advantages over the pneumatic (compressed air) anti-G suits that are currently in use at various air
forces including the US Air Force. Instead of air, Libelle uses water to provide counter pressure
proportional to the gravitation force. The ﬂuid is contained in expandable, snake-like tubes that run
from the neck to the ankles and over the shoulders to the wrists (http://www.txkell.ang.af.mil/news_
events/suit.htm).
Like biology, botany also takes aerodynamics into account. The seeds of many plants
are designed with features that allow them to disperse away from their origin. The need to
disperse can be attributed to the possibility of overcrowding of the speciﬁc type of plant in the
same local area. Seeds use various aerodynamic techniques to be propelled by the aid of winds,
for example, see Figure 1.20 the winged seed of the Tipuana tipu (about 6.5-cm long). Such seeds
have inspired designs of futuristic missions with spacecraft that would soft-land on planets with
atmospheres such as Mars. Adapting this design may allow for designing a parachute with better

capability to steer itself to land at selected sites. Some of the issues being studied include the
appropriate vehicle size, acceptable descent speed in the Martian atmosphere, mass distribution
and platform shape to assure stable autorotation and scalability from operation on Earth to
performance on Mars.
1.8.3
Social and Other Biological Behaviors
One of the many characteristics of humans and animals is their sociability, i.e., having the ability to
express feelings, respond to stimulation, and make independent decisions, actions, and reactions.
Efforts are increasingly being made to imitate such characteristics with robots. These robots are
being equipped with autonomous operation, the ability to communicate feelings in the form of
facial expressions and voices, to react to feelings expressed by humans, to have defense and attack
capabilities, as well as many other characteristics that are considered biological (Bar-Cohen and
Breazeal, 2003).
Generally, many of our behavioral characteristics are learned throughout our life, with some
abilities that are genetically coded and improved through our life experience. Some animals have
some abilities that are far superior to those of humans, and these are coded into their genetics. For
example, babies of migratory animals begin walking without assistance or guidance minutes after
birth. While the baby depends on its mother for milk for survival, it is ‘‘equipped’’ with extensive
other abilities that are critical to its survival including seeing, hearing, running, recognizing danger,
and even the capability of passive self-defense. Inspired by these characteristics, robots are
increasingly being developed with autonomous operations and programmed with social abilities
to interact with humans (Breazeal, 2004). Learning to make realistic robots with social skills can
have many important beneﬁts including understanding behavior in humans and providing a cure to
certain phobias. Recent advances in virtual reality and AI allow studying and treating patients with
phobias such as the fear of heights, or closed areas.
Social creatures, including insects and birds, have various approaches for solving difﬁcult
computational problems such as discrete optimization. Examples of modeling for optimization
include activities in ant colony and the seed-picking process of pigeons. The latter, which is also
known as the Particle Swarm optimization algorithm, is an analytical tool that is based on the
statistical process of seeds picking. This algorithm is considered very effective in evolving
hardware and particularly in designing combinational electric circuits (Amaral et al., 2004).
These biologically inspired optimization algorithms are used to solve problems such as vehicle
routing and routing in telecommunication networks.
Operating in a group generally gives social creatures advantages in defense that are unavailable
to animals that operate individually. Migrant animals move as a herd, warn each other, and even
jointly defend themselves. Birds ﬂy in formation to help with long distance travel by taking
advantage of vortices that are formed by ﬂapping their wings. Lionesses gather in packs to protect
their cubs not only from potential enemies but also from other male lions, as lions will kill cubs that
are not their own to have their own genes entered into the species gene pool. Ants and bees live in a
social structure and are able to accomplish extensive tasks because of this behavior. Wolves
traveling in packs to hunt have the head of the pack ‘‘instruct’’ the other wolfs who obey the
head’s orders while chasing herds or other prey (Towery, 1996). In some ways, military operations
are similar, as the commander in a military operation directs the soldiers, and they also ‘‘obey the
orders’’ while executing the war strategy that is dictated by the commander. Generally, wolfs have
a highly complex social order where every pack has a male leader, and all wolves in the pack are
aware of their positions through communication with various body postures.
Roboticists are now considering the use of multiple small robots that can operate in colonies like
the ants. Such robots are made capable to operate both as individuals in cooperative systems, and as
inter-connectable parts of a large system. Their capabilities would be far greater than those that can
be obtained with an individual robot.

INTERFACING BIOLOGY AND MACHINES
Interfacing between humans or animals and machines to complement or substitute our biological
senses enables important means for medical applications. Of notable signiﬁcance is the interfacing
of machines and the human brain. A development by scientists at Duke University (Wessberg et al.,
2000; Mussa-Ivaldi, 2000) enabled this possibility, where electrodes were connected to the brain of
a monkey, and using brain waves, the monkey operated a robotic arm, both locally and remotely via
the Internet. This research is also in progress at Caltech, MIT, Brown University, and other research
institutes. Progress in the past couple of years led to the development of chips that can recognize
brain signals for movement and convert them into action (Musallam et al., 2004). Monkeys ﬁtted
with such chips were trained to move cursors on computer monitors, where such devices translate
signals from the brain’s motor cortex, the region that directs physical movement.
Advances in this ﬁeld have reached the level that recently, the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) approved, on a limited basis, the conduction of such experiments on humans. For this
purpose, Cyberkinetics, in Foxborough, Massachusetts (Serruya et al., 2002) is developing this
capability using microchips that are implanted in the motor cortex region of ﬁve quadriplegic
patients to allow them mouse control and computer access. The near term objective of this study is
to develop neural-controlled prosthetics. The current chips last up to a year and efforts are made to
develop a longer lasting wireless capability. Using such a capability to control prosthetics would
require feedback in order to provide the human operator a ‘‘feel’’ of the environment around
artiﬁcial limbs. The feedback can be provided with the aid of tactile sensors, haptic devices, and
other interfaces. Besides feedback, sensors will be needed to allow users to protect the prosthetics
from potential damage (heat, pressure, impact, etc.), just as it is with our biological limbs. Also, it is
hoped to provide disabled people with the ability to communicate through speech or sign to control
their artiﬁcial organs.
Interfacing of visualization and hearing devices and the human brain have already emerged
where hearing devices are increasingly implanted and imaging devices are currently at advanced
research stages (Chapters 11 and 17). The eye’s focusing mechanism as well as the iris and the eyelid
have already been mimicked in today’s cameras. While signiﬁcant advances have been already
made, the human eyes combined with the brain have far superior capabilities including image
interpretation and recognition, ability to rapidly focus without moving the lens location in the eye,
3-D capability, high sensitivity, and operability in a wide range of light intensities from very dark
to quite bright light. Such a capability has grown signiﬁcantly with the emergence of small digital
cameras that are now part of many cellular phones and webcams for telecommunication via
computers. It is highly desirable to see via such cameras real-time images with performances that
approach the capability of the human eye. Also, researchers are working to create implants that can
help the vision-impaired regain the ability to see (Chapter 17). Increasingly, sophisticated visual-
ization and image recognition are emerging in security systems. However, while lab demonstrations
have been very successful, these systems still have recognition errors at unacceptable levels. One of
the beneﬁts of this capability, once the reliability issues are overcome, would be a standard operation
as part of homeland security in airports, public areas, or even in our homes.
1.9.1
Telepresence and Teleoperation
Simulators, which involve virtual reality and the ability to ‘‘feel’’ remote or virtual environments are
highly attractive and offer unmatched capabilities. To address the need for remote feeling of mecha-
nical forces, the engineering community is developing haptic (tactile and force) feedback systems.
Users of such simulators of procedures may immerse themselves in the display medium while being
connected through haptic and tactile interfaces to allow them to ‘‘feel the action’’ at the level of their
ﬁngers and toes. Thus, an expert can perform various procedures from the convenience of the ofﬁce
34
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

without having to be present at the operation site. Telepresence requires the capability to intuitively
project to the user as much sensation of the remote site as possible, including the distribution of
reaction forces, temperatures, textures, and other sensations that we associate with our feeling of
touching objects. The potential of making such a capability was enabled with a high resolution and
large workspace using the novel remote MEchanical MIrroring using Controlled stiffness and
Actuators system (MEMICA) (Bar-Cohen, 1999; Fisch et al., 2003). For this purpose, scientists at
JPL and Rutgers University used an electro-rheological ﬂuid (ERF), which becomes viscous under
electroactivation. Taking advantage of this property, they designed miniature electrically controlled
stiffness (ECS) elements and electrically controlled force and stiffness (ECFS) actuators. Using this
system,the feeling of the stiffness and forces appliedat remoteor virtual environments arepotentially
reﬂected to the users via proportional changes in ERF viscosity. Figure 1.21 shows a graphic
representation of the concept of MEMICA for the simulation of various control procedures — either
through virtual reality or as a telepresence. Using such a system, surgeons may be able to conduct a
virtual surgery via a virtual reality display while ‘‘feeling’’ the stiffness and forces that are involved
with the procedure.
Potential beneﬁciary of the simulation of medical therapy includes astronauts who operate at a
great distance from Earth. The probability that an urgent medical procedure will need to be
performed in space is expected to increase with the growth in duration and distance of manned
missions. A major obstacle may arise as a result of the unavailability of on-board medical staff
capable of handling every possible medical emergency. To conduct emergency treatments and
deal with unpredictable health problems, the medical crews will need adequate tools, and the
capabilities to practice the necessary procedure in order to minimize risk to the astronauts. With
the aid of all-in-one type surgical tools and a simulator, astronaut(s) with medical background
would be able to practice the required procedures, and later physically perform the speciﬁc
procedures. Medical staff in space may be able to sharpen their professional skills by practic-
ing new procedures. Generally, such a capability can also serve people who live in rural and
other remote areas with no readily available full medical care capability. As an education tool
employing virtual reality, training paradigms can be changed while supporting the trend in
medical schools towards replacing cadavers with computerized models of human anatomy. Another
potential beneﬁt that MEMICA offers is the ability to provide intuitive control of remote
Figure 1.21
Performing virtual reality tasks using the ERF-based MEMICA haptic interface offers the potential of
a highly attractive interactive simulation system.

robots. These types of robots include the NASA Johnson Space Center robotic astronaut, which is
known as Robonaut.

CONCLUSIONS
After billions of years of evolution, nature developed inventions that work, which are appropriate
for the intended tasks and that last. The evolution of nature led to the introduction of highly
effective and power efﬁcient biological mechanisms. Failed solutions often led to the extinction of
the speciﬁc species that became a fossil. In its evolution, nature archived its solutions in genes of
creatures that make up the terrestrial life around us. Imitating nature’s mechanisms offers enormous
potentials for the improvement of our life and the tools we use. Humans have always made efforts to
imitate nature and we are increasingly reaching levels of advancement where it becomes signiﬁ-
cantly easier to mimic biological methods, processes, and systems. Advances in science and
technology are leading to knowledge and capabilities that are multiplying every year. These
improvements lead to capabilities that help understand better and implement nature’s principles
in more complex ways. Effectively, we have now signiﬁcantly better appreciation of nature’s
capabilities allowing us to employ, extract, copy, and adapt its inventions.
Beneﬁts from the study of biomimetics can be seen in many applications, including stronger
ﬁber, multifunctional materials, improved drugs, superior robots, and many others. Another aspect
of biomimetics is to recognize the importance of protecting species from extinction, lest we lose
nature’s solutions that have managed to survive, but which we have not yet studied or still do not
understand. Nature offers a model for us as humans in our efforts to address our needs. We can learn
manufacturing techniques from animals and plants such as the use of sunlight and simple com-
pounds to produce with no prolusion, biodegradable ﬁbers, ceramics, plastics, and various chem-
icals. Nature has already provided a model for many human-made devices, processes, and
mechanisms. One can envision the emergence of extremely strong ﬁbers that are woven as the
spider does, and ceramics that are shatterproof emulating the pearl. Besides providing models,
nature can serve as a guide to determine the appropriateness of our innovations in terms of
durability, performance, and compatibility. Biomimetics has many challenges, including the
author’s arm-wrestling challenge announced in 1999, which has taken the human muscle as a
baseline for the development of artiﬁcial muscles. The challenge is still open even after the
competition held in 2005; however, advances towards making such arms are helping the ﬁeld of
biomimetic greatly.
Inspirations from nature are expected to continue leading to technology improvements, and the
impact is expected to be felt in every aspect of our lives. Some of the solutions may be considered
science-ﬁction in today’s capability, but as we improve our understanding of nature and develop
better capabilities this may become a reality sooner than we expect.

INTRODUCTION
We marvel at the extraordinary performances of animals. The animal kingdom provides us with
inspiring examples of species that move seemingly effortless in unstructured, unpredictable,
and ever-changing environments. To appreciate the beauty and the complexity of the motion
of animals, one just has to think of a gazelle trying to escape a cheetah on the Serengeti
plains. Both animals display a remarkable maneuverability, while running at maximum speed over
a bumpy terrain covered by obstacles. Their performance is shaped by their evolution driven by
the need to outperform the other in the struggle for survival. Their abilities outdo that of any human-
made device and it is not surprising that humans have tried to develop devices that mimic animal
locomotion.
As far back as the 15th century people have designed and built machines in an effort to copy
aspects of animal locomotion (Breazeal and Bar-Cohen, 2003). The resulting designs were great
illustrations of the technological ‘‘state of the art’’ of those times. None of these designs, however,
yielded performances that came close to mimicking the agility and performance of biological
locomotion. The most likely explanation for this is that those devices were engineered using
materials with very different properties compared to biological materials. Only recently, with the
41

development of soft, ﬂexible polymer materials with actuation properties, biological-like locomo-
tion has been made possible (Breazeal and Bar-Cohen, 2003). The beneﬁts are many, provided that
we can identify the principles that constitute the basis for biological-like locomotion. Nature can
serve as a template for future designs, given that the proper questions are asked and the potential
pitfalls are identiﬁed. The most important pitfall to consider is the fact that nature does not strive for
optimality. Natural designs are built upon their evolutionary history, which may impose consider-
able constraints. Nature’s design process works on a ‘‘good enough’’ basis (Vogel, 1998). Direct
copying from Nature is likely to result in suboptimal performances; rather we should strive for
understanding the enabling principles and develop them further to achieve optimal performance
(Full and Meijer, 2001; Meijer et al., 2003).
Biomimetic design requires that engineers and biologists work closely together. To make this
collaboration work, one should understand that both ﬁelds have very different approaches as
Vincent (2004) concluded: ‘‘Engineers look at the problem and try to ﬁnd an answer, biologists
look at the answers and try to ﬁnd out what the problem was.’’ The starting point of any biomimetic
design should be the function to be emulated. For example, for a legged biomimetic robot, one
would like to emulate the spring-mass and pendulum characteristics that are exploited by animals
(Full and Koditschek, 1999). The technological aim here is to build mobile platforms that are
robust, agile, ﬂexible, energy-efﬁcient, self-sustaining, self-repairing, independent movers (no
cables), as well as adaptable to requirements set by the task and the environment. To this aim, it
is insightful to study the solutions that animals have found to meet these requirements (Full and
Meijer, 2001; Meijer et al., 2003). Moving animals exploit various energy-saving mechanisms; they
have a redundant set of actuators, they are soft and ﬂexible, and most important they can adapt and
repair their tissues in response to injury and changing requirements. The key to successful animal
locomotion is the multi-functionality of their muscles.
Primordial biological qualities like adaptation, modularity, robustness are important principles
for R&D of new artiﬁcial muscles. They represent the basis for new developments in bionics,
mechatronics, orthotics, and prosthetics that explore the simplicity of a mechanism or material with
the complexity or sophistication of a control system mimicking the biological parts with state-of-
the-art actuators. Biomimetic control, in which adaptation of state-of-the-art actuators and design of
control systems provide new functionalities to current aids for disabled, is an important new ﬁeld.
Understanding the behavior of the musculoskeletal system will lead to active or semiactive systems
for interaction with the human limbs: spring-based actuator system for a knee–ankle–foot orthosis
(KAFO) mimicking the lacking functionalities of a certain group of muscles during walking, upper
limb orthotics for active treatment of pathological tremor by means of dampers, and ultrasonic
motors compensating a certain disorder.
In recent years, material scientists have developed soft and compliant electroactive polymers
(EAP) that have actuating abilities (Bar-Cohen, 2001a,b; Kornbluh et al., 2001). It has been argued
that these novel technologies will enable the development of artiﬁcial muscles and eventually
lead to legged robots that outperform their biological counterparts (Bar-Cohen, 2001a,b; Kornbluh
et al., 2001). Preliminary comparisons between rudimentary EAP actuators and biological
muscles have revealed that their mechanical performance is comparable (Full and Meijer, 2000,
2001; Meijer et al., 2003; Wax and Sands, 1999). Speciﬁcally, it has been found that stress, strain,
and power capabilities of the EAP actuators are within or even exceed that of natural muscle
(Meijer et al., 2001, 2003). Despite the resemblance in these performance metrics, none of these
actuators could be called truly ‘‘muscle-like’’ for two reasons. First the working principle of EAP
actuators is very different from biological muscle; it will be argued in this chapter that the
uniqueness of muscle as an actuator is partly due to its contractile mechanism. Second, muscles
are complex and dynamic actuators that are capable of tailoring to speciﬁc functional demands by
modiﬁcation of their structure, thus far no human-made actuator possesses this capacity for
remodeling.
42
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

This chapter focuses on the principles that underlie muscle function and plasticity while
considering their potential for new design in actuators. The emphasis will be on the organization
of the contractile proteins and how this is related to functional demands. To this aim, a description
of the principal contractile unit, the sarcomere, will be given. The various sarcomere designs
present in the animal kingdom will be discussed in relation to their functional consequences.
Subsequently, the principles of muscle remodeling and repair in response to use and disuse will
be discussed. The chapter will end with a discussion of the principles that could prove to be relevant
for the design of ‘‘muscle-like actuators.’’
2.2
MUSCLE FUNCTION
Muscle force production is characterized by three contraction modes: concentric, isometric, and
eccentric. During concentric contractions muscles generate force while shortening. Force produc-
tion during concentric contractions is described by the force–velocity relationship in which force
production declines with increasing speed. In isometric contractions the muscle generates force
without changing its length, for example, when the task requires holding a certain position. In
eccentric contractions the muscle generates force while being lengthened, for example, when an
animal needs to decelerate a limb.
One of the primary functions of skeletal muscles is to generate force while shortening in order to
power the movement of the attached appendages. Comparative studies have revealed the broad
range in force generating and shortening abilities of skeletal muscle (Full, 1997; Josephson, 1993;
Medler, 2002). Maximal strain ranges from 2 to 200% (Full, 1997). The maximal isometric stress of
muscles (Po) varies by three orders of magnitude from 8 to 2200 kN/m2. The maximal rate of
shortening (Vmax) varies by two orders of magnitude from 0.35 to 38 muscle lengths per second
(Josephson, 1993; Medler, 2002). Body size has an important inﬂuence on muscle function, with
muscles from smaller animals having larger contractile speed (Medler, 2002). It has been suggested
that this is a consequence of the higher movement frequencies utilized by small animals (Medler,
2002). Operating frequency varies by three orders of magnitude and ranges from less than one to
over a 1000 Hz (Full, 1997).
Recent sophisticated experiments have revealed that during animal locomotion muscles do more
than just generating power. In fact, the multi-functionality of muscle is the key explanation for the
success of animal locomotion (Dickinson et al., 2000; Full and Meijer, 2001). Driven by techno-
logical advances, researchers are now capable of determining muscle function during animal
locomotion. One of the approaches involves direct measurement of muscle function using small
force and length sensors implanted in the muscle of choice (Biewener et al., 1998a,b; Grifﬁths,
1991; Roberts et al., 1997). Others have determined in vivo 3-D kinematics of animal locomotion
and muscle activity patterns, and used this data to replicate the in vivo muscle length changes and
stimulation patterns in workloop experiments (Ahn and Full, 2002; Josephson, 1985). The emer-
ging picture from these experiments is that muscles are well equipped to meet the basic require-
ments for successful locomotion, that is power generation, stability, maneuverability, and energy
conservation. For example, insect ﬂight muscles operate as tunable springs that keep the thorax at
which the wings attach in resonance. The muscles themselves undergo very small strains and the
design is very effective for operation at high frequencies (100 Hz and above) that are needed to keep
insects airborne. To sustain the high frequencies, these muscles make use of specialized contractile
mechanisms (Josephson et al., 2000). In these muscles there is no direct correspondence between
muscle contraction and muscle action potential; hence they are called asynchronous muscles
(Machin and Pringle, 1959). Some muscles do not even shorten during their daily tasks. For
example, during level running, the calf muscle ﬁbers of turkeys generate force without shortening
(Roberts et al., 1997). Functionally, they work like struts, transmitting energy between body
segments. They use their force to load the elastic structures within the muscle, like the aponeurosis,

43

that takes up most of the length changes while storing and returning elastic energy during the
locomotion cycle. Due to the high resilience of these series of elastic structures, this mechanism
allows the muscle to operate more efﬁciently. Several other studies have revealed that muscles are
also used as brakes (Ahn and Full, 2002), shock absorbers (Wilson et al., 2001), and even (to push
the analogy with motor parts further) as gearboxes (Rome and Lindstedt, 1997; Rome, 1998). In
addition to this, recent modeling studies have pointed out the importance of viscoelastic muscle
properties for the stability of locomotion (van Soest and Bobbert, 1993; Wagner and Blickhan,
1999). The idea postulated in these latter studies is that, due to their inherent stiffness and damping
properties, muscles will act as a ﬁrst line of defense in response to external perturbations (Loeb
et al., 1999). Understanding muscle function requires a systems approach in which the inﬂuences of
the neural control signals, the muscles biochemistry, and its morphology are studied in relation to
the required performance (Dickinson et al., 2000; Full and Meijer, 2001).
2.3
THE FUNCTIONAL UNITS
Muscle function is determined by speciﬁc adaptations at all levels of the muscle hierarchy. Muscles
are comprised of distinct functional modules called ‘‘motor units’’ which are controlled individually
by the central nervous system (CNS) via a network of peripheral nerves. A motor unit consists of
motor neuron, which via its axon innervates a distinct set of muscle ﬁbers. From a control
perspective, motor units are the building blocks of muscle function. Force production and modu-
lation occur through discrete and sequential recruitment of individual motor units. An important
property of motor units is that all muscle ﬁbers belonging to a single unit have an identical
biochemical make up. Individual motor units are classiﬁed based on their size, speed of contraction,
and fatigue resistance. A typical muscle contains a mix of different motor units, which gives the
CNS the freedom to tailor function to demand. For example, during slow incremental loading tasks,
motor units are recruited according to Henneman’s size principle (Henneman et al., 1965). This
means that the slow, small, fatigue-resistant motor units are recruited ﬁrst, followed by faster,
larger, and less fatigue-resistant motor units when the load increases. During fast ballistic tasks like
jumping, however, recruitment according to the size principle is not sufﬁcient to accelerate the
limbs fast enough. It has been shown that under these circumstances motor units are recruited
according to a reversed size principle (Wakeling, 2004). Furthermore, motor unit plasticity in
response to use or disuse can alter the motor unit proﬁle of a muscle and thereby its function.
Muscle function is not just inﬂuenced by the amplitude of the neural control signal, but also by the
phase of the control signal in relation to the movement kinematics. For example, it has been shown
that neuromuscular system of jumping frogs has evolved phase relationships between the control
signals and the movement kinematics that yield optimal power output (Lutz and Rome, 1994).
Motor unit activity is under control of the CNS, and regulated by reﬂex activity of several sensory
systems. Therefore, it enables a rich pattern of voluntary and autonomous muscle functions.
Besides neural control, muscle morphology at the macroscopic and microscopic level has a
major impact on muscle function. Muscle ﬁbers are attached to the skeleton via elastic tendons.
Macroscopically, the ratio of muscle ﬁber length to tendon length is a major determinant of muscle
function (Biewener et al., 1998a). For example, the calf muscles of wallabies have very short
muscle ﬁbers in series with a long tendon. This design appears to be an adaptation to enhance
the storage and return of elastic energy to allow for more efﬁcient locomotion (Biewener et al.,
1998a). At the microscopic level, muscle tissue is highly ordered, typically comprising thousands of
muscle cells embedded in a matrix of basal lamina (Trotter and Purslow, 1992). The muscle cells,
or muscle ﬁbers, are long and slender multinucleated cells in which the contractile proteins are
arranged in highly organized structures called ‘‘sarcomeres.’’ The sarcomeres are the working units
of the muscle ﬁber. A typical ﬁber comprises several thousand sarcomeres in series and in parallel.
Microscopically, sarcomere design and the arrangement of sarcomeres within a muscle ﬁber are
44
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

major determinants of muscle function. Other important structures within muscle cells are the
mitochondria that are responsible for the aerobe energy metabolism and the sarcoplasmic reticulum
(SR), which plays a crucial role in the activation and relaxation kinetics of muscle. It is known that
changes in the volume fraction of mitochondria, SR, and myoﬁbrillar proteins can be utilized to
modify muscle function (Conley and Lindstedt, 2002). For example, in high-frequency muscles
involved in sound production, the SR fraction is enlarged at the expense of the myoﬁbrillar protein
fraction to attain superfast muscle contraction (Conley and Lindstedt, 2002). This kind of special-
ization will not be dealt with in this chapter. Instead the remainder of this chapter will focus on the
design and organization of the sarcomeres, and it will be discussed how the natural design might
provide inspiration for artiﬁcial muscles.
2.3.1
The Sarcomere
Sarcomeres are anisotropic, hierarchic, liquid crystalline structures comprised of contractile and
structural proteins (Figure 2.1). The constituting proteins are responsible for muscle elasticity and
its ability to perform work. Under the microscope, sarcomeres are visible as repetitive units of dark
and light bands. The light band or I-band contains the thin, actin ﬁlaments and the dark or A-band
contains the thick, myosin ﬁlaments. The sarcomeres are separated by Z-disks, comprised of a-
actinin, which segment the myoﬁbrils (Figure 2.1). The actin ﬁlaments project from the Z-disks
towards myosin ﬁlaments in the center of the sarcomere. In the center of the A-band there is a
lighter zone, the M-line which is a disk of delicate ﬁlaments, and its main function is to keep the
myosin ﬁlaments aligned. The myosin ﬁlaments are also connected to the Z-disks via a protein
called titin. Titin is responsible for keeping the myosin ﬁlaments aligned, and is the main
determinant of passive elasticity in muscle (Tskhovrebova and Trinnick, 2002; Lindstedt et al.,
2001, 2002). It also plays an important role in the sarcomerogenisis (Russell et al., 2000). There are
several other important proteins present in the sarcomere. Nebulin, for example, is located in
the I-band, and is thought to be responsible for determining the length of the actin ﬁlament.

Furthermore, there are several structural proteins present in the M-line (i.e., M-protein, myomesin)
and the A-band (C-protein) that presumably keep the myosin ﬁlaments in register during contraction.
Sarcomere force production stems from the interaction between the actin and myosin ﬁlaments.
In vertebrate sarcomeres, six actin ﬁlaments surround each myosin ﬁlament. Myosin ﬁlaments of
vertebrates consist of approximately 100 myosin molecules, each shaped like a golf club with a
double head. The myosin heads protrude from the core of the ﬁlament towards the surrounding actin
ﬁlaments. Actin ﬁlaments consist of two helical strands of F-actin twined together like a bead
necklace. On each of the beads is a site where myosin can bind. Binding is regulated by the
conﬁguration of the proteins troponin and tropomyosin, which is controlled by Ca2þ. When a
myosin head attaches to an actin-binding site, it undergoes a conformational change resulting in the
development of force and sliding of the actin and myosin ﬁlaments along each other. Under the
inﬂuence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the crossbridge detaches again. Pumping back calcium
ions into the SR via ATP-consuming calcium pumps triggers the relaxation. The formation of
connections between myosin and actin is a stochastic process and it is known as the crossbridge
theory (Huxley, 1957, 2000).
Force production of the sarcomere unit depends on the length of the sarcomere and the velocity
at which the sarcomeres shorten or lengthen. According to the sliding ﬁlament theory (Huxley and
Niedergerke, 1954; Huxley and Hanson, 1954), the length dependence of force production is
determined by the amount of overlap between the actin and the myosin ﬁlaments. Sarcomeres
have an optimal length for force production (+ 2.3 mm in vertebrates) at which the ﬁlament overlap
allows the maximum number of crossbridges to be attached. At lengths over the optimal one,
the overlap decreases and thus the amount of force. At lengths less than optimal, internal forces
and reduced overlap due to interference of actin ﬁlaments of neighboring sarcomeres also result in
less force. As a consequence, each sarcomere has a typical length–force relationship (Figure 2.2)
whose shape depends on the length and ratio of the actin and myosin ﬁlaments. The velocity
dependence of sarcomere force production is determined by the probabilities for crossbridge
attachment and detachment. For shortening sarcomeres, the relationship is characterized by a
hyperbolic function (Figure 2.2). Together the force–length and force–velocity functions determine
the maximal work and power that a sarcomere of given dimensions can generate. Theoretical
studies have indicated that in many cases sarcomere design is optimized for power production (van
Leeuwen, 1991).
Sarcomeres do not operate independently. They are connected to adjacent sarcomeres in series
via the Z-disk and until recently it was thought that the series connection was the main pathway to
get the force of individual sarcomeres to the outside world. More recently (Patel and Lieber, 1997),
it has been found that sarcomeres also make connections with adjacent sarcomeres in parallel and

with the cell membrane via specialized structural proteins like desmin (Figure 2.1). Based on the
evidence from animal experiments (Huijing, 1999), it is now thought that the force of individual
sarcomeres ﬁnds its way to the outside via both serial and parallel pathways.
2.4
MUSCLE DESIGN
Within the animal kingdom, the variety in muscle designs is stunning. There are bulky muscles (m.
gluteus maximus), long slender muscles (sartorius), muscles with short ﬁbers attached to long
tendons (m. gastrocnemius), pennate muscles, etc. Muscle design is highly variable within an
animal and also between species. It appears as if there is a specialized muscle design for each
possible function (Otten, 1988). It is beyond the scope of this chapter to review all possible designs
and functions, and therefore a few basic design principles of muscle will be discussed. Muscles are
built from sarcomeres and as a consequence it has two basic design options to tune into functional
demands. It can modify either the design or the arrangement of the sarcomeres. Both options appear
to have been explored by Nature.
2.4.1
Not all Sarcomeres Are Alike
Invertebrates appear to have explored the possibilities of sarcomere design to its full potential.
Invertebrate sarcomeres range from very short (0.9 mm) as in squid tentacles (Kier, 1985) to very
long (20 mm) as in crab claw muscles (Taylor, 2000). This broad range is achieved by the diversity
in the length of both the myosin (0.86–10 mm) and actin ﬁlaments. In addition, the ratio of actin to
myosin ﬁlaments is also variable ranging from as low as 2:1 to as much as 7:1 (Figure 2.3 and
Figure 2.4).
The diversity of the invertebrate sarcomere design illustrates how nature makes use of slight
modiﬁcations to a basic design to meet functional demands. From a theoretical point of view, it

could be argued that long sarcomeres with long myosin ﬁlaments mean that more crossbridges will
be available for force generation (Vogel, 2001; Alexander, 2003). Thus long sarcomeres should be
capable of generating large forces. This view is supported by experimental evidence on crustacean
claw muscles, where it is shown that muscle stress increases with sarcomere resting length (Taylor,
2000). At the other end of the spectrum, it could also be argued that short sarcomeres are good for
fast contractions needed in power-demanding tasks like ﬂying or ballistic movements like jumping
or catching a prey. After all, for a given crossbridge stroke, a short sarcomere would shorten
relatively more than a long sarcomere, and thus its intrinsic speed would be higher. This is in fact
what happens in squid tentacles. The sarcomeres responsible for the fast elongation of squid
tentacles are ultra short and can contract very rapidly (Kier, 1985). In an excellent review on

invertebrate musculoskeletal design, Full (1997) showed that there are speciﬁc sarcomere designs
for speciﬁc functions or modes of locomotion (Figure 2.4). For example, arthropod limbs have slow
and fast muscles. The slow muscles are mainly used during posture, burrowing, and slow locomo-
tion, while the fast muscles are involved in rapid locomotion and escape. Not surprisingly, the slow
muscles are the ones that have the longest sarcomeres (Full, 1997).
With respect to sarcomere design, vertebrates are pretty conservative. Their sarcomeres typic-
ally have a length between 2 and 3 mm. With myosin ﬁlaments having a more or less constant length
of 1.6 mm, much of the variability is due to differences in the length of actin ﬁlaments. Their length
ranges from 0.95 mm in chicken to 1.27 mm in humans (Ashmore et al., 1988; Burkholder and
Lieber, 2001; Lieber and Burkholder, 2000; Walker and Schrodt, 1973). Furthermore, in vertebrate
sarcomeres, the ratio of actin to myosin ﬁlaments is virtually constant at 2:1. As a consequence,
vertebrates have only a limited capacity to tailor their sarcomeres to meet functional demands and
will have to resort to different mechanisms to achieve this.
2.4.2
Rearranging the Sarcomeres, Muscle Morphology
The function of vertebrate and invertebrate muscle is intimately related to their morphology. To
meet functional demands while at the same time accounting for volume and length constraints set
by (exo)skeletal dimensions, sarcomeres are arranged in speciﬁc ways. The basic design options are
the parallel and serial arrangement of the sarcomeres. Figure 2.5 illustrates the functional conse-
quences of these mechanisms. Adding sarcomeres in parallel increases the force of the muscle,
whereas serial addition of sarcomeres increases the operating range of the muscle as well as the
maximal shortening velocity.
Some muscles, like the human hamstrings, are long and slender. They have long parallelly
arranged muscle ﬁbers that contain many sarcomeres in series. They are capable of considerable
shortening while maintaining the ability to generate sufﬁcient force. Interestingly, there appears to
be a limit to the length of individual muscle ﬁbers; one rarely comes across muscle ﬁbers longer
than 10 cm. Muscles whose ﬂeshy belly exceeds this length, like the human and feline sartorius
muscle (Loeb et al., 1987), have tendinous plates that interconnect muscle ﬁbers in series. The exact
reason for this design is thus far unclear. It has been suggested that it has to do with control
problems involved in synchronizing the activation of sarcomeres in very long ﬁbers, but it might
also be a solution to ensure structural integrity of the muscle.
Pennate muscles have relatively short muscle ﬁbers that are orientated at an angle with the line
of work of the muscle. The advantage of this design is that the number of sarcomeres arranged in

parallel for a given muscle length and volume is much larger than what could be obtained with a
parallel ﬁbered muscle. Clearly, pennate muscles are built for force. Examples of pennate muscles
are the calf muscles of humans (whose main function is to provide enough force to allow storage of
elastic energy in the Achilles tendon) and the claw closer muscles of crabs. Interestingly, the latter
uses both sarcomere (long sarcomeres) and muscle (pennation) design to generate as much grip
force as possible. This may not come as a surprise when one considers the tough shells a crab has to
crack. For the invertebrates with their exoskeletons, the pennate muscle design gives one additional
advantage. Jan Swammerdam discovered in 1737 that muscles remain constant in their volume
during contraction, a fact that falsiﬁed the then prevailing hypothesis that contraction came about
by a change in muscle volume. For a parallel-ﬁbered muscle, the requirement of constant volume
means that the muscle must become thicker when contracting. This can be disadvantageous when
you are trapped in an exoskeleton. Pennate muscles offer the solution to this problem. Their ﬁbers
rotate when they shorten, thereby making volume available for the thickening ﬁbers without
changing the width of the muscle (Vogel, 2002).
2.5
MUSCLE ADAPTATION
Once a muscle has formed and its basic morphological design is set, there still is room for
remodeling. The ability to adapt in response to changes in functional demands sets living tissues
apart from their engineered counterparts. Muscles grow during development, they remodel in
response to use and disuse, and they are able to repair themselves after an injury. Fully grown
muscles still posses the ability to more than double their size by increasing either their physiological
cross-sectional area (PCSA) or their length. This is achieved by increasing muscle ﬁber size by
adding sarcomeres in parallel or in series, but not by increasing the number of muscle ﬁbers. The
ﬁrst signs of muscle adaptation occur within hours and adaptation can be completed within days
(Shah et al., 2001). It is not known whether adaptation involves alterations in sarcomere design.
Whether a muscle adapts by parallel or serial addition of sarcomeres is determined by the
functional demands. In strength training where the muscle is subjected to high loads, the adaptation
will involve addition of parallel sarcomeres to reduce the load on the individual contractile units
(Russell et al., 2000). This mechanism may be responsible for a more than twofold strength gain of
the muscle. Alternatively, when an animal grows or when it starts using its limbs in new body
conﬁgurations, the muscle will start adding sarcomeres in series. This mechanism can be respon-
sible for length changes of the muscle of up to 27% (Shah et al., 2001). There are a number of
theories on the mechanism for length adaptation of the muscle. Some studies have provided
evidence that a muscle strives to have its optimal muscle length at the most prevalent joint position
(Williams and Goldspink, 1973; Burkholder and Lieber, 1998), while others have argued that
maintenance of adequate joint excursion is the most important trigger (Koh and Herzog, 1998).
Another theory is that muscles adapt their length to prevent injury. In severely injured muscles,
entire muscle ﬁbers are replaced, however, in mild injury involving local lesions to sarcomeres just
the damaged sarcomere are replaced. Muscle responds to injury with overcompensation probably
as a safety precaution to future incidents. Lynn et al. (1998) have shown that injury induced by
eccentric contractions results in addition of serial sarcomeres. The consequence of this adaptation is
that the recovered muscle will operate at the ascending limb of its length–tension relationship,
where it is less prone to lengthening induced injury. It is conceivable that all three mechanisms co-
exist, but the length at which the muscle operates determines their action. It has been observed that
the operating range of different muscles is scattered over the entire functional length range, some
muscles work on the ascending limb and others on the descending limb (Burkholder and Lieber,
2001; Lieber and Burkholder, 2000). This is also reﬂected in the observation that muscles within a
single anatomical group display different adaptations that are triggered by functional demands
(Savelberg and Meijer, 2003).
50
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

The rules governing muscle adaptation are complex and far from being resolved (Russell et al.,
2000). Regulatory pathways are triggered by growth signals (mechanical, hormonal), resulting in
gene transcription followed by translation and assembly of the proteins into the contractile
architecture (Russell et al., 2000). Several myogenic regulatory factors are involved in the remod-
eling of muscle, they are triggered by multiple signals and they can activate or inhibit each other’s
action (Brooks and Faulkner, 2000). Teasing out the exact relationships is experimentally difﬁcult
and time consuming. As a consequence, our understanding of the adaptation laws at the molecular
level is still fragmentary. Modeling approaches might be helpful in understanding the intricate
relationships (Jacobs and Meijer, 1999)
2.6
BIOMIMETICS OF MUSCLE DESIGN
It is unlikely and probably undesirable that future polymer actuators will use the exact working
principles as the contractile mechanism of biological muscle. Consequently, current research
focuses on the design of polymer actuators that mimic the functionality of muscle based on
alternative working principles (Bar-Cohen, 2001b; Kornbluh et al., 2001; Meijer et al., 2003). It
is argued in this chapter that it might be useful to look at the design principles that enable the variety
in muscle function. Unlike current EAP actuators, muscle design is modular. Muscle function is
achieved by concerted action of thousands of functional units called sarcomeres. It has been shown
that muscle function is shaped by sarcomere design and arrangement. Hence, an evaluation of the
beneﬁts of sarcomeric design in relation to synthetic muscle design may be useful.
Robustness is an important requirement for an actuator. It is crucial that an actuator does not
breakdown while functioning, in other words it needs to avoid mechanical failure. Biological
materials are remarkably tough, meaning that it requires a lot of energy to break them. They
achieve this by using energy release mechanisms that help to avoid crack propagation. As a
consequence, small failures do not become catastrophic (Gordon, 1976). Although there is little
data on the fracture mechanics of muscle, it can be argued that the sarcomere design of muscle
helps to avoid small injuries that may make the muscle nonfunctional. It is well known that
muscle injury in response to tensile stresses results in local disruptions of sarcomeres. These
lesions are local and do not seem to propagate through the muscle. Morgan (1990) provided an
explanation for these lesions and their functional consequences in what is now known as the
‘popping sarcomere’ theory. He proposed that sarcomeres that are subjected to high tensile stress
undergo rapid lengthening that is stopped by the structures responsible for the passive tension of
muscles (titin, external membranes). The popping has three functional consequences: (1) the
rapid lengthening releases some of the energy, (2) the lengthened sarcomere will act as a
spring in series with the remaining sarcomeres and will be able to withstand higher tensile
stresses, and (3) the remaining sarcomeres will shorten somewhat and increase their strength as a
consequence they will be able to withstand higher tensile stresses as well. In other words, under
high tensile stresses individual sarcomeres will be sacriﬁced to maintain the structural integrity of
the muscle. From experience it is known that some EAP actuators break very easily under tensile
stresses, it could be argued that a modular design might help to increase the robustness of these
actuators.
The modular design of muscle also facilitates the remodeling and repair of the muscle. The self-
healing properties of muscle emerge from the integration of muscles into a system that allows
wound healing and continuous turnover via transport of nutrients and removal of waste products. It
is arguably much simpler to grow and repair individual units than having to adapt the entire
structure. Furthermore, it may be argued that the variety in designs is facilitated by the modular
design — just like Lego enables designs only limited by one’s imagination. Until recently,
remodeling and repair was only feasible within the domain of biological materials and systems.
However, recent innovations in material science have resulted in self-repairing polymers (Wool,
Biomimetics of Muscle Design
51

2001), smart materials that can remodel (Anderson et al., 2004) and be fabricated using molecular
self-assembly (Zhang, 2003). If these concepts can be integrated in a system that allows for
transport of the necessary components and removal of the waste products then remodeling polymer
actuators may become available in the future.
The use of sarcomeres as the basic functional unit also imposes limitations on the functionality
of muscles. It is likely that millions of years of evolution have resulted in a full exploration of the
sarcomere design. Consequently, it seems unlikely that the design has the potential to generate
tensions far above the 2200 kN/m2, strain larger than 200% or shortening rates above 40 lengths
per second. These performance metrics are eventually limited by space requirements and the speed
of enzyme actions. For example, to accommodate the large forces generated by the claw closer
muscles of the crab, the thickness of the myosin ﬁlament has to increase. As a consequence, there is
less space for the actin ﬁlaments. This will limit the maximum amount of crossbridges in a certain
volume and thus the speciﬁc tension. Understanding these limitations may be useful for the design
of future actuators.
Mimicking the sarcomeric design of muscle in a synthetic muscle may prove to be a ﬁrst step
towards a novel class of robust and functionally diverse actuators, and initial attempts look
promising (Frank and Schilling, 1998). The next step will require an integrative systems approach
to understand and mimic the functions of biological musculoskeletal systems during natural
movements (Full and Koditschek, 1999). This approach will identify the biomechanical principles
to be introduced in artiﬁcial models. An integrated approach to artiﬁcial muscle design has a strong
research potential. As an example, realistic biomechanical models of human limbs for analysis of
locomotion, with emphasis on understanding the underlying geometries and control problems,
provide an interesting basis to conceive a systems-based approach: large groups of muscle tendon
complexes have been successfully modeled as simple contractile elements in a functional model
(Roberts and Marsh 2003); redundancy problems associated with large muscle numbers are solved
with the proper control criteria (Rehbinder and Martin, 2001). Most importantly, the qualitative
insight obtained from models of biomechanical and control mechanisms are to be included in the
design of novel biomimetic muscular systems.
A biomimetic muscle must be provided with versatility and adaptability; with current state-of-
the-art actuator technology and its known limitations, this can be obtained if conceived in an
integrated approach. Examples of this can be found in novel applications in the ﬁeld of biorobotics
and prosthetic devices. For example, a force-controllable ankle joint actuator for an ankle–foot
orthosis (Blaya and Herr, 2004) conceived as combination of controllable devices (DC motor,
springs) with an adaptive control strategy deﬁned upon the biomechanical model of the anatomical
joint, can result in an actuator system that can adapt dynamically partially recovering a speciﬁc gait
disorder (drop foot) suffered by a group of patients. The joint impedance control introduced through
the series elastic actuator reduces signiﬁcantly the foot slap and improves swing phase dynamics in
patients, as reported by the authors. Crucial constructive needs expected for such a system — and
any biomimetic wearable device — are low volume and size, low energy consumption, quiet
operation, low heat dissipation, and high torque (i.e., 3.3 W per body kilogram are required at the
beginning of the leg swing). These challenges are to be overcome by new actuators and materials,
providing lifelike characteristics. The weak musculoskeletal system in this case not only requires
assistance to control the impedance but also power generation (peak demand during gait, 3.3 W per
body kilogram) and other compensations to avoid other disorders found under the same muscular
disabilities, like dragging of the toe during swing phase, incomplete forefoot rocker and difﬁculty
to raise the foot. Such a biomimetic system can increase its level of functionality by increasing
the level of system integration. Following this example of biomimetic actuation and control for
orthopedics, a novel system for the impaired lower leg is being developed (Moreno et al., 2004). It
includes elements imitating the roles of anatomical parts, like tendons to assist powered acceler-
ations or the roles of biarticular muscles in a limb (Hof, 2001) to include the coordination
mechanisms.

SUMMARY
In recent years, material scientists have developed polymer materials that can be used to develop
artiﬁcial muscles. To facilitate robotic and prosthetic design, such artiﬁcial muscles should be
multi-functional, robust, modular, and have the capacity to repair themselves in response to
damage. It has been argued that studying the working principles of biological muscle may inspire
the design of artiﬁcial muscles. This chapter gives an overview of the relationship between muscle
form and function, with an emphasis on the sarcomeric design of muscle. The following issues were
addressed: (1) muscles are multi-functional actuators; (2) contractile proteins are organized in
functional units called sarcomeres; (3) muscle function is modiﬁed in two basic ways — (a)
modifying the sarcomere design and (b) rearranging the sarcomeres; and (4) muscle adaptation in
response to functional demands. The chapter ends with a discussion on how the sarcomeric design
of muscle can provide inspiration for the design of artiﬁcial muscles.

INTRODUCTION
This chapter describes the state of the art in creating animal cognition in machines. It begins
with a discussion of the two fundamental processes of cognitive knowledge acquisition — training
and education. The subsequent sections then present some ideas for building key components
of cognition (language, sound, and vision). The main point of this chapter is to illustrate how
we can now proceed towards the mechanization of key elements of cognition. This chapter
assumes that the reader is familiar with the concepts, terminology, and mathematics of elem-
entary confabulation (as described in Hecht-Nielsen, 2005) and its hypothesized biological
implementation in the human cerebral cortex and thalamus (as described in the Appendix of this
chapter).
3.1.1
Mechanized Cognition: The Most Important Piece of AI
As discussed in Section 3.A.1 of the Appendix, human (and higher mammal) intelligence involves
a number of strongly interacting, but functionally distinct brain structures. Of these, signiﬁcant
progress has now been made on three: cerebral cortex and thalamus (the engine of cognition — and
the focus of this chapter), basal ganglia (the behavioral manager of the brain — which manages
action evaluation, action selection, and skill learning), and cerebellum (the autopilot of the brain —
which implements detailed control of routine movement and thought processes with little or no
need for ongoing cognitive involvement once a process has been launched and until it needs to be
terminated). There are a number of other, smaller-scale, brain functions that are also critical for
intelligence (e.g., ongoing drive and goal state determination by the limbic system), but these will
not be discussed here.
Of all of the components of intelligence, cognition is, by far, the most important. It is also the
one that has, until now, completely resisted explanation. This chapter provides the ﬁrst sketch of
how cognition can be mechanized. The approach is based upon the author’s theory of vertebrate
cognition, which is described in the chapter’s Appendix. This chapter is not a historical description
of ‘‘how cognition was mechanized’’; but is instead an ‘‘initial plan for mechanizing cognition.’’
Initial progress in implementing this plan in areas such as language and hearing (the subjects of
Sections 3.3 and 3.4) has been encouraging.
3.1.2
Lexicon Capabilities
This chapter considers some more sophisticated variants of confabulation that go beyond elemen-
tary confabulation. Each lexicon used in our (technological) cognitive architectures (collections of
lexicons and knowledge bases) will be assumed to possess the machinery for carrying out each of
these confabulation variants (or information processing effects — the term that will be used for
them here), as described below. Thus, from now on, the term lexicon implies a capability for
implementing a ﬁnite set of symbols, maintaining a list of the excitation states of those symbols,
and for executing the effects deﬁned below. For the moment, lexicon dynamics will be ignored.
(However, in later sections, concepts such as consensus building and symbol interpolation, which
intrinsically require lexicon dynamical behavior, will be brieﬂy mentioned.)
One very important detail that was not discussed in Hecht-Nielsen (2005), and only brieﬂy
discussed in the Appendix (because it is not relevant to the biological implementation of elementary
58
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

confabulation), is that a lexicon can have multiple highly excited symbols at the end of a
confabulation (as opposed to just one active symbol or the null symbol). When this occurs, the
neurons representing these symbols will be excited at various (high) levels for different symbols.
When such multiple highly excited but not active symbols are used as ‘‘assumed facts’’
transmitting through a knowledge base, their effects on symbols to which they link via this
knowledge base will essentially be the product of their excitation times, the link strength.
In practice, such multi-symbol ‘‘assumed facts’’ are very important, as they are the key ingre-
dients in consensus building (dynamically interacting confabulations taking place contemporan-
eously in multiple lexicons), which is the dominant mode of use of confabulation in human
cognition. However, to keep this chapter at an elementary and introductory level, the mathematics
of multiple-symbol ‘‘assumed fact sets’’ will not be discussed in detail. As needed, the qualitative
properties of this mode of confabulation will be discussed, which will be sufﬁcient for this
introduction.
For the technological purposes of this chapter, confabulation will be taken to be dependent upon
the input excitation sum I(l) of symbol l, which is redeﬁned (from the Appendix) to be:
I(l)  [ln (p(ajl)=p0) þ B] þ [ln (p(bjl)=p0) þ B] þ [ln (p(gjl)=p0) þ B]
þ [ln (p(djl)=p0) þ B]
¼ ln [p(ajl)  p(bjl)  p(gjl)  p(djl)]  4 ln (p0) þ 4B,
(3:1)
where ln is the natural logarithm function, B is a positive global constant called the bandgap
(a term coined by my colleague Robert W. Means), and p0 is the smallest meaningful p(cjl) value.
Clearly, for a symbol l receiving N knowledge links, the value of I(l) ranges over the numerical
interval from NB to N[ln(1/p0) þ B]. It will be assumed that the constant B is selected such that for
N ¼ 1, 2, . . . , Nmax none of these intervals ever overlap. For example, if we take p0 ¼ 0.0005 and
Nmax ¼ 10, then we can select B ¼ 100. The intervals upon which I(l) can lie are then given by
[100,107.6], [200,215.2], . . . , [1000,1076.0] for N ¼ 1, 2, . . . , Nmax, respectively. The utility of
this deﬁnition will be seen immediately below. Given these preliminaries, we can now discuss
variants of confabulation.
The ﬁrst effect considered is erasing, denoted by E. Erasing clears the current record of
excitation states of the lexicon and prepares the lexicon for a new use. For example, before a
lexicon is used as the answer lexicon of a confabulation operation, it must be erased.
Elementary confabulation (as described in Hecht-Nielsen, 2005), denoted by W, is carried out
by activating a single symbol e with the highest value of I(l) (ties are broken randomly). By
activation it is meant that the ﬁnal excitation level I(e) of that symbol is set to 1 and the ﬁnal
excitation levels of all other symbols are set to zero. There is also the effect WK, which is the same
as W with the added requirement that the single winning symbol, if there is to be one, must have had
at least K knowledge link inputs (i.e., the winning symbol must have its input intensity in the Kth,
or higher, I(l) interval). The primary form of confabulation discussed in Hecht-Nielsen (2005)
was W4.
The effect CK (confabulation conclusions having K or more knowledge link inputs), which will
be needed for discussions, ﬁrst zeros the excitation sum I(u) of each symbol u whose I(u) is not in the
Kth (or higher) I(l) interval(s) occupied by symbols of the lexicon. The excitation levels of all
the symbols are then summed. Finally, each remaining nonzero symbol excitation is then divided
by this sum to yield its ﬁnal excitation level. For example, in the above example with p0 ¼ 0.0005
and Nmax ¼ 10, and B ¼ 100, if the four highest symbol input excitation sums are 346.8, 304.9,
225.0, and 146.8, then a C2 will yield only the top three symbols, with ﬁnal excitation levels of
0.395, 0.3478, and 0.2566, respectively. Clearly, this effect yields the set of confabulation conclu-
sion symbols that had K or more knowledge link inputs. Normalizing the sum of the ‘‘signiﬁcant
symbol’s’’ excitation levels to 1.0 corresponds to the notions of ‘‘activation’’ and ‘‘high excitation’’

in cortex. It also induces what might be thought of as a probability distribution on the expectation
symbols. Cognition must very often conduct a multi-stage process of gradually promoting hypo-
theses (expectation symbols) which gain signiﬁcant support from incoming knowledge links and
demoting those which fail to gain as much support. Thus, the effect CK is very important in
cognition. In the brain, ‘‘CK processing’’ is continuous in time and happens very rapidly.
The set of symbols of a lexicon having nonzero excitation levels I(l) following a W, WK, or CK
effect is termed an expectation. Expectations are considered to have a short life (i.e., after a ‘‘short’’
time has elapsed after a confabulation the state of the lexicon, its collection of I(l) values, becomes
indeterminate). Note that this is a generalization of the term expectation used in Hecht-Nielsen
(2005). The term active is still reserved for the case of a single confabulation conclusion; and highly
excited will still mean that the expectation has multiple elements.
Another effect is freezing, denoted by the letter F. Freezing a lexicon causes each symbol with
positive ﬁnal excitation (i.e., after a W, WK or CK) to have its ﬁnal excitation I(l) value preserved
for a longer time. During this (still rather brief) period of time that follows F, only those symbols
which are members of this expectation can receive further knowledge link inputs. In other words,
the input excitations of symbols not in the expectation stay at zero during the frozen period. So, for
example, if further new link inputs arrive shortly after an F has been invoked, and then a W is
commanded, an expectation symbol (if there are any) which obtains the highest positive I(l) value
will be made active.
As we will see later, building and using expectations is one of the most important elements of
cognitive information processing. By using sequences of confabulations to ‘‘whittle down’’ ex-
pectations, constraint knowledge of various kinds can be applied to rapidly home in on a ﬁnal
conclusion. In effect, each expectation represents the set of all ‘‘reasonable conclusions’’ that are
worth considering further. When the expectation is ﬁnally reduced to one conclusion, via succes-
sive freezes and confabulations, the ﬁnal, decisive conclusion is found (or if the ﬁnal expectation is
empty, then the answer is ‘‘I don’t know’’). Almost every aspect of cognition is implemented by
such sequences of such ‘‘deductive’’ confabulation steps (although this is not deduction in any
formal sense, because it is based on the undecidable (but usually reasonable) assumption of
exhaustive knowledge).
Finally, consider a lexicon which, when last used for confabulation (within the past few hours),
yielded a decisive conclusion and which, subsequently, has not been erased. If this lexicon now
receives a W, WK, or CK but no knowledge link inputs, that symbol which was its last conclusion
will, in isolation, become active. This is a sort of temporary symbol storage mechanism that the
theory terms working memory. If the lexicon has been erased, an expectation containing some of the
symbols which resulted from recent past uses will be expressed (with the chances of appearing
depending upon how many times that symbol was frozen in succession when it originally
appeared).
3.1.3
Discussion
Technological cognition will be inherently limited without the other functionalities that brains
provide (see Appendix Section A.1). Further limitations arise because of the lack of on-line
memory formation mechanisms (short-term, medium-term, and long-term memory processes)
and the lack of a capability for goal-driven delayed reinforcement learning of thought and
movement procedures (see Section 3.6). Yet, despite these limitations, there are probably many
high-value early applications of pure cognition that will be possible. Pure cognition is the focus of
this chapter.
Language is almost surely the faculty which accounts for the dramatic increase in human mental
capability in comparison with all other animals. It is in the language faculty, and in the language
faculty’s interfaces with the other cognitive faculties, that almost all distinctly human knowledge
is centered. Thus, language is where the mechanization of cognition must start (see Section 3.3).

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

However, before discussing language cognition, the next section discusses the currently available
general methods of antecedent support knowledge acquisition: training and education.
3.2
TRAINING AND EDUCATION
As discussed above, current confabulation technology is limited to development of knowledge
using some externally guided process; not via dynamic, autonomous goal and drive satisfaction-
driven memory formation, as in brains. This section discusses the two main processes currently
used in knowledge development: training and education. When dynamic memory formation
eventually arrives, training and education will still be important learning processes (but no longer
the only ones).
3.2.1
Training
Training is a knowledge acquisition process that is carried out in a batch mode without any
signiﬁcant active supervision or conditional intervention. It is a learning mode that can only be
applied when the data set to be used has been carefully prepared. For example, in learning proper
English language structure it is possible to take a huge (multi-gigaword) proper text corpus and
train knowledge bases between lexicons representing the words in English (e.g., Hecht-Nielsen,
2005 presented an example of this). The corpus used must be near-perfect. It must be purged of
words, punctuation, and characters that are not within the selected word list and must not have any
strange annotation text, embedded tables, or markup headers that will be inadvertently used for
learning. Achieving this level of cleanliness in a huge training corpus which, necessarily — for
diversity, is drawn from many sources, is expensive and time consuming.
Once a suitably clean text corpus has been created, each sentence is considered as a whole item
(up to a chosen maximum allowed number of words — e.g., 20 — after which the sentence is
simply truncated). The confabulation architecture to be trained has as many word lexicons (in a
linear sequence) as the maximum number of allowed words in a sentence. The words of the
sentence are represented by active symbols on the corresponding lexicons of the architecture (see
Section 3.3 for more details). Co-occurrence counts are then recorded for each causal pair of
symbols (i.e., between each symbol and each of the symbols on lexicons further down the temporal
sequence of lexicons). Once these counts are recorded, the process moves on to the next sentence of
the training corpus.
A beautiful thing about training is that the result is knowledge that presumably has the same
origin and legal standing as knowledge obtained from material that a person has read; but which
they do not remember in detail. Namely, this knowledge is presumably not subject to source
copyright restrictions or other source intellectual property restrictions. Use of raw data for training
probably falls under the category of ‘‘fair use,’’ which eliminates any need to pay royalties.
Confabulation-based systems may thus be able to absorb whole libraries of knowledge without
cost. This is fair use because the content of the work is not stored and cannot be recalled. (How
much does your library charge you in royalties for reading a book? Answer: Absolutely nothing,
because reading a library book is fair use.) This fortuitous loophole may allow cognitive machines
to rapidly and efﬁciently accumulate almost all human knowledge; without having to pay any
royalties and without the delays associated with working through legal and bureaucratic objections.
Mechanizers of cognition may want to expose their systems to the available libraries of written
knowledge at the ﬁrst possible opportunity; before legal innovators ﬁnd ways of closing this
loophole. It may not be long before intelligent machines are as unwelcome at libraries as blackjack
card counters are at casinos.
In the near term, early confabulation entrepreneurs will probably use libraries, web scrapers, or
informally obtained e-mail message examples (for text knowledge), informal public volunteer web
Mechanization of Cognition
61

portals for conversational data (for sound knowledge), public location video (for vision know-
ledge), and multi-camera video of moving humans with colored dots pasted to their bodies (for
motor knowledge). Paying for training data will probably not be feasible for most confabulation

The above comments also raise the technical legal question of whether the knowledge in
confabulation-based systems can itself be copyrighted (this would seem reasonable); or must it
be protected as a trade secret? Methods of training and education can probably be patented. The
legal implications and ramiﬁcations of confabulation are clearly going to be complicated and
probably contentious. An overriding consideration should be the irreplaceable value of the work
output that intelligent machines (which can potentially produce prodigiously, but not consume
signiﬁcantly) will quickly add to the world economic product. It will be fun to watch this saga
unfold in the courts and in diplomacy over the coming decades.
Knowledge created by training is limited to situations such as that considered above; namely,
where extensive, highly conditioned and prepared, data sets exist. In more general situations,
online, active, expert human supervision must be employed to carefully select meaningful symbol
co-occurrences for use in learning. Such a carefully sequenced program of sophisticated and
controlled exposure of the machine to meaningful examples is termed education; which is the
subject of the next subsection.
3.2.2
Education
A critical aspect of development, particularly in higher mammals, is the limited, deliberately con-
trolled exposure to progressively more complicated stimuli, and intelligent responses thereto, that
characterizestheearlyphasesofananimal’slife(whichincats,mightoccupy afewweeks;whereasin
humans it occupies tens of years — which is often not enough!). During this development period, the
sequenceofexposureoftheanimaltoinformationisinsomemannercontrolled(oftenbyconﬁningthe
animal to a particular limited range, such as a nest, home, or school and its immediate surround).
For example, a human baby learning to see has eyes that are physically incapable of focusing
much beyond its reach. Thus, most visual stimuli are the baby’s own limbs or individual objects that
the baby itself is holding and manipulating. During this period, the visual system develops its ability
to segment individual objects in single views and also develops higher-level visual lexicons
containing symbols that are pose-insensitive (see Section 3.5). Knowledge related to the integration
of form, color, texture, and internal object motion is also developed during this initial phase. In
order for this phase to properly complete, the baby must have spent a large amount of time holding
and viewing a reasonably rich collection of objects.
Once the initial phase of human visual development is completed, the baby begins to acquire
distant vision and begins to learn about a much richer visual environment. Again, parental provision
of appropriate stimuli and response examples during this period is critical. Persons who are deprived
of visual input during these early phases (e.g., due to disease that temporarily impairs visual
function) are never able to complete their visual development, even if their visual input is restored
at some later point. Such persons can respond to light in some limited ways, but can never see. Some
persons with restored sight actually voluntarily limit their exposure to visual input (Gregory, 2004).
As with the initial stage of visual development, the most important source of educational input
in the later stages of visual development is the children themselves. By holding an object and
examining it (e.g., in an exploration of its function or component parts), knowledge in the visual
domain, as well as in the linkage of vision to the language (and other) faculties, is expanded. Unlike
intellectual knowledge (which is subject to various distortions such as philosophical or ideological
brainwashing), visual knowledge is ‘‘safe’’ to rapidly gather and store because it is essentially never
erroneous (except in cases where optical distortions exist — which when corrected too late in the
development process, often cause a permanent reduction in visual capability). Parents
often endlessly admonish their children not to handle everything they fancy in stores; yet, this is
62

probably enriching. Perhaps the admonishment should be to take care not to soil or damage what
they handle. If you are punctilious in this regard, have your children wear disposable latex gloves
and force them to pay for any damage or breakage out of their allowance. But give them these
valuable experiences.
Evenmorethanbasicsensoryprocessing,learningtocarry outimportant behavioraltasksrequires
deliberate provision of examples and supervised rehearsal practice. This often includes feedback on
performance; something that will be ignored here since using such feedback requires noncognitive
functions, which as yet, we do not understand sufﬁciently to build. Because of this current lack of a
reinforcement learning adjunct to cognition (work is proceeding in this area — see Miyamoto et al.,
2004, for example), for the moment, education of confabulation-based cognitive systems will
probably be conﬁned to strictly positive examples. In other words, examples, where learning should
deﬁnitely take place.
For example, consider a confabulation-based vision system viewing cars passing by on a busy
road. The visual portion of the system segments each car it ﬁxates on (see Section 3.5) and then
rerepresents its visual form, color, and internal motion using high-level symbols that have invari-
ance properties (e.g., pose insensitivity). Thus, the ﬁnal product of processing one such look is
activation of a set of high-level symbols, each describing one visual attribute of the object.
Imagine that a human educator sitting at a computer screen where each look (eyeball snapshot
image — see Section 3.5) to be processed by the confabulation-based vision system is being
displayed (each subsequent look is processed only after the previous look’s use for education has
been completed). The human examines the visual object upon which the center (ﬁxation point) of
the eyeball image rests and describes it in terms of English phrases (spoken into a noise-canceling
microphone connected to an accurate speech transcriber — see Section 3.4). For example, if the
object is a green Toyota Tundra truck with a double cab; the educator might speak: ‘‘Toyota Tundra
truck,’’ ‘‘dark green,’’ ‘‘two rows of seats; in other words, a full-sized back seat,’’ ‘‘driving in the left
lane of trafﬁc.’’ After accurate transcription, this text is represented by a set of active symbols in the
language module (see Section 3.3). Knowledge links are then established between the active visual
symbols representing the visual content of the look and the active language symbols representing
the education-supplied language content of the look.
Note that the language description is not exhaustive; it is just a sample of descriptive terms for
the visual object. For example, if a similar look of the same truck were presented on another
occasion, the educator might add: ‘‘oh, and there are four dogs in the bed of the truck.’’ This would
add further links.
3.2.3
Discussion
One of the most exasperating things about this theory is that it seems impossible that just forming
links between symbols and then using these links to approximately maximize cogency could ever
yield anything resembling human cognition. The theory appears to be nothing but a giant mountain
of wishful thinking!!! That such a simple construction can do all of cognition is indeed astounding.
Yet, that is precisely my claim. Some reasons why confabulation may well be able to completely
explain cognition are now discussed.
First is the fact that the number of links that get established (i.e., the number of individual
items of knowledge that are employed) is enormous. Even in the narrow domain of single proper
English text sentences (see Section 3.3), over a billion individual knowledge items are often
employed (contrast this with the world’s largest rule bases; which have about 2 million items
of knowledge). Slightly more elaborate proper English text confabulation systems (able to deal
with two successive sentences — see Section 3.3) often possess multiple billions of items of
knowledge.
The value of having such huge quantities of such a simple form of knowledge is best seen in
terms of how this knowledge is used in confabulation. The ﬁrst use of knowledge is to excite those
Mechanization of Cognition
63

conclusion symbols which strongly support the truth of the set of assumed facts being considered
(this is the duck test, as described in Hecht-Nielsen, 2005).
But an even more important aspect of cognition is the underlying assumption that the knowledge
we possess is exhaustive (see Hecht-Nielsen, 2005). In other words, once the available knowledge
has been used, we can be reasonably sure that no other possible conclusions exist. This effectively
causes the known knowledge to act as an implied constraint. In particular, those possible conclu-
sions identiﬁed as known to be supportive of the assumed facts are not just viable alternatives; they
are probably the only viable alternatives. Thus, in non-Aristotelian information environments, the
exhaustive knowledge assumption leads to answers which are ‘‘almost logical deductions.’’ Thus,
beyond just being an implementation of the duck test, confabulation might be termed a ‘‘strong’’
(although not logically rigorous) form of inductive reasoning.
Another factor that makes confabulation so powerful is its ability to support the construction and
use of lexicon hierarchies. In the simplest case, the symbols of a higher-level lexicon each represent
an ordered set of symbols that meaningfully co-occur on lower-level lexicons. But much more is
possible. For example, in vision (see Section 3.5), higher-level symbols each represent several
groups of lower-level symbols. These are symbol groups that are seen in successive ‘‘eyeball
snapshots’’ of the same object at the same ﬁxation point (but at slightly varied object poses). In this
way, these higher-level symbols respond to the appearance of a localized portion of an object at a
number of different poses. They are pose-insensitive localized visual appearance descriptors.
In language hierarchies, knowledge can be used to discern symbols which are highly similar in
meaning and usage (in a particular given context) to a particular symbol. These are termed
semantically replaceable elements (SREs). Knowledge possessed about an SRE of a symbol can
sometimes be used to augment knowledge possessed about that base symbol. This can signiﬁcantly
extend the ‘‘conceptual reach’’ of a system; without requiring training material covering all possible
combinations of all symbols. For example, what if a friend tells you about the food ‘‘guyap’’ that
they had for breakfast. They poured the ﬂakes of guyap from its cardboard box into a bowl; added
milk and sweetener, and then ate it with a spoon. It was good. By now, you are fairly sure that
‘‘guyap’’ is a breakfast cereal of some kind, and at least in the ‘‘breakfast food’’ context, you can
apply your knowledge about breakfast cereal to ‘‘guyap.’’
Hierarchies can work backwards too. For example, if you say you are looking for a ruler on your
desk; then links from the word ruler (and perhaps some of its SREs) go to the visual system and
provide input to high-level visual attribute (‘‘holistic’’) representation symbols which, in the past,
have meaningfully co-occurred with visual sightings of rulers. This is accomplished via a CKF
effect; which leaves an expectation of all such symbols that have previously been signiﬁcantly
linked to the word ruler. During perception, which takes place immediately after this expectation
symbol set has been generated, knowledge links from primary, and then secondary visual lexicons
arrive at this high-level visual lexicon and a W, CK, or WN is issued at the same time. Only
elements of the expectation can be activated by the visual input; and the net result is a set of
symbols that are consistent with both the word ruler and with the current visual input. As discussed
further in Section 3.5, the ﬁnal step is a rapid bidirectional knowledge link interaction of the higher-
level expected symbols with those of the lower-level lexicons to shut off any symbols that are not
participating in ‘‘feeding’’ (i.e., are not consistent with) symbols of the high-level expectation. This,
in effect, causes low-level symbols representing portions of the visual input that are not part of the
ruler to be shut off. It is by this visual object segmentation mechanism that sensory objects are
almost instantly isolated so that they can be analyzed without interference from surrounding objects
(segmentation is also a key part of sound and somatosensory processing). Without an expectation,
sensory processing cannot proceed (this point, which seems to be widely unappreciated in the
biologically oriented neuroscience disciplines, is the subject of a wonderful book describing clever
experiments that well illustrate this point [Mack and Rock, 1998]).
Above all else, cognition works because of the huge hierarchical repertoire of learned and stored
action sequences (programs of thought and/or movement — see Section 3.6). Appropriate actions
64
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

or action sequences are triggered instantly each time a lexicon confabulation operation yields a
single active symbol (i.e., a decisive conclusion). As discussed in Appendix, this is the conclusion–
action principle of the theory. The action(s) automatically triggered by the winning symbol can be
of many characters. They can be immediate postural goal outputs that are sent down the spinal cord
to motor nuclei and the cerebellum, they can be immediate lexicon operation commands, they can
be immediate knowledge base operation commands, or they can be candidate actions (cortically
proposed thoughts and movements) which must ﬁrst be sent to the basal ganglia for evaluation and
approval before they are executed.
The main advantage of confabulation-based cognition over traditional programmed computing
(formal computer programs, rule-based systems, etc.) is a much greater capacity for handling novel
arrangements of individually familiar objects. Programmed computing must essentially have a
predeﬁned plan for dealing with every situation that is to be handled. For example, a plan for
breaking up a complicated ensemble of problems into isolated, disconnected sub-problems, so that
each can be handled in a predeﬁned way. Unfortunately, in most real-world situations, this
approach fails badly because complicated real-world situations inevitably have unanticipatable
interrelations between their elements that disallow pre-deﬁned decompositions. By virtue of their
huge stores of general-purpose and low-level knowledge, confabulation-based systems are inher-
ently able to take novel external context into account as each individual conclusion (or ensemble of
conclusions — if mutual solution constraints are to be honored — see the discussion of consensus
building in Section 3.3) is addressed. Confabulation-based systems can also adapt existing action
plans (e.g., by replacing speciﬁc elements of a stored plan with similar substitutions which are
relevant to the current situation) to ﬁt novel circumstances. They do not typically run out of things
to try and, instead, tend to press on and do the best they can, given what they know. If a particular
approach yields no conclusion, other approaches are typically immediately launched. Yet, because
actions are triggered each time a conclusion is reached, almost all behavioral sequences are
dramatically novel. Also, each new experience can (with occasional help from a human educator)
be added to the knowledge base to further enlarge the system’s future repertoire.
More could be said regarding the beneﬁts of the confabulation approach. However, the remain-
ing sections of this chapter present more concrete examples of this. The nature of cognition is very
different from that of computing. So much depends upon designing clever architectures of lexicons
and knowledge bases and upon using clever, highly threaded, but very simple, thought processes to
control these architectures. Since the information processing control which must be exerted at each
stage of an action process is triggered by the current cognitive world state (the collection of all
decisive confabulation conclusions that are active, or accessible from working memory, at that
moment), cognition has no need for ‘‘computer programs’’ or ‘‘software.’’ In effect, the conclusion
of each ‘‘cognitive microprogram’’ (lowest level action sequence) is a GOTO statement. There is no
overall program ﬂow deﬁned. Just action sequences completing and then triggering subsequent
action sequences (in a pattern that almost never exactly repeats). Things happen as they happen,
with no master program controller involved or needed (although a number of subcortical brain
structures can execute ‘‘interrupts’’ when certain conditions occur). This brain operating system (or
lack thereof, depending on your point of view) seems like an invitation to disaster. However,
beyond possible conﬂicting commands to the same action (movement or thought) resource (which
are impossible by design! — see Appendix Section 3.A.2), very little can go wrong.
3.3
LANGUAGE COGNITION
This section discusses the use of confabulation for representing and generating language. This
application arena is the most developed, and yet is transparently crude and primitive. An enormous
amount of work needs to be done in language. The hope of this section is to illustrate how promising
this research direction is.

3.3.1
Phrase Completion and Sentence Continuation
This discussion of language cognition begins with consideration of a class of confabulation
architectures for dealing with single English sentences. These architectures address the problems
of phrase completion and sentence continuation; simple subcases of language generation. This
subsection expands upon on the brief introduction to phrase completion provided in Hecht-Nielsen
(2005). These architectures provide a good introduction to the ‘‘look and feel’’ of cognitive
information processing — which is completely different than the familiar computer paradigm.
Figure 3.1 illustrates a confabulation architecture for phrase completion and sentence contin-
uation in a single sentence of up to 20 words. Each lexicon has about 63,000 symbols; including
symbols for the 63,000 most common words in English (as reﬂected in the training corpus) and
eight punctuations (period, comma, semicolon, etc.), which are treated as separate words. Capital
letters are used when they appear in words in the training corpus selected for representation within
the word lexicons (i.e., mark and Mark are different words with different symbols). Thus, many
of the words in the lexicon are represented twice — once capitalized and once not; some have
even more than two representations, e.g., EXIT, Exit, and exit; and some, such as e.g., and the
punctuations are never capitalized and only have one representation.
Once a suitably ‘‘clean’’ huge proper English text training corpus (typically containing billions
of words) has been created, each successive sentence in the corpus is entered, in sequence, into the
architecture of Figure 3.1. The ﬁrst word of the sentence is entered into the leftmost lexicon (i.e.,
the symbol representing this word is made active) and the remaining words of the sentence (or
punctuations — which, again, are treated as separate words) are entered successively until
the ending period. If the sentence has more than 20 words, those words beyond the ﬁrst 20 are
discarded. Because of the positioning of the words of each sentence in order, this architecture is
termed position-dependent.
It is also possible to use hierarchical ring architectures for representing strings of words; which
I believe is probably how the human cortical language architecture is organized. As the words are
loaded into the ring of lexicons, they are quickly removed in groups (phrases) and re-represented in
lexicons at a higher conceptual level — leaving the lower-level lexicons free for capturing
additional words. I believe that this is why humans can only instantly remember ‘‘about 7 things
+2’’ (Miller, 1956) — we physically only have about seven lexicons at the word level. When
required to remember a sequence of things, we repeatedly rehearse the sequence (to ﬁrmly store it in
short-term memory) by traversing the ring from the beginning lexicon (which is always the same
one for each sentence or word sequence) to the last item and then back to the beginning. However,
given the lack of limitations of computer implementations of confabulation architectures (at least
conceptually), there is no need for us to use these more complicated ring architectures for this
chapter’s introductory discussion.
The knowledge bases of the architecture of Figure 3.1 are all causal; meaning that the symbols
of each lexicon are only linked to symbols of later lexicons (i.e., those that lie to the right of it);
Figure 3.1
Naı¨ve single-sentence confabulation architecture for proper English phrase completion or sentence
continuation. Knowledge bases link each of the ﬁrst 19 of the 20 lexicons to all of the lexicons to their right.
Sentences are represented with the ﬁrst word in the ﬁrst lexicon on the left; and so on in sequence. This architecture
has a total of 19 þ 18 þ . . . þ 1 ¼ 190 knowledge bases.
66
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

which represent words which occur later in the temporal sequence of the word string. The ﬁrst (i.e.,
leftmost) lexicon is connected to all of the 19 lexicons which follow it by 19 individual knowledge
bases. The second lexicon to the 18 lexicons to its right, and so forth. Thus, this architecture has a
total of 20 lexicons and 190 knowledge bases.
The training process starts with the ﬁrst sentence of the training corpus and marches one
sentence at a time to the last sentence. As each sentence is encountered, it is entered into the
architecture of Figure 3.1 (unless its ﬁrst 20 words include a word not among the 63,000; in which
case, for this introduction, the sentence is assumed to be skipped) and used for training. The details
of training are now discussed.
At the beginning of training, one hundred and ninety 63,000  63,000 single precision ﬂoat
matrices are created (one for each knowledge base) and all of their entries are set to zero. In each
knowledge base’s matrix, each row corresponds to a unique source lexicon symbol and each
column corresponds to a unique target lexicon symbol. The indices of the symbols of each lexicon
are arbitrary, but once set, they are frozen forever. These matrices are used initially, during training
on the text corpus, to store the (integer) co-occurrence counts for the (causally) ordered symbol
pairs of each knowledge base. Then, once these counts are accumulated, the matrices are used to
calculate and store the (ﬂoating point) p(cjl) antecedent support probabilities. In practice, various
computer science storage schemes for sparse matrices are used (in both RAM and on hard disk) to
keep the total memory cost low.
Given a training sentence, it is entered into the lexicons of the architecture by activating the
symbol representing each word or punctuation of the sentence, in order. Unused trailing lexicons
are left blank (null). Then, each causal symbol pair is recorded in the matrix of the corresponding
knowledge base by incrementing the numeric entry for that particular source symbol (the index of
which determines the row of the entry) and target symbol (the index of which determines the
column of the entry) pair by one.
After, all of the many tens of millions of sentences of the training corpus have been used
(‘‘read’’) for training (i.e., the entire training corpus has been traversed from the ﬁrst sentence to the
last); the entries (ordered symbol pair co-occurrence counts) in each knowledge base’s matrix are
then used to create the knowledge links of that knowledge base.
Given a knowledge base matrix, what we have traditionally done is to ﬁrst set to zero any counts
which are below some ﬁxed threshold (e.g., in some experiments three, and in others 25 or even 50).
In effect, such low counts are thereby deemed random and not meaningful. Then, after these low-
frequency co-occurrences have been set to zero, we use the ‘‘column sum’’ of each count matrix to
determine the appearance count c(l) of each target symbol l for a particular knowledge base.
Speciﬁcally, if the count of co-occurrences of source symbol c with target symbol l is c(c,l) (i.e.,
the matrix entry in row c and column l), then we set c(l) equal to the column sum of the quantities
c(f,l) over all source lexicon symbols f. Finally, the knowledge link probability p(cjl) is set equal
to c(c,l)/c(l), which approximates the ratio p(cl)/p(l), which by Bayes’ law is equal to p(cjl).
Note that the values of c(c,l), c(l) and p(cjl) for the same two symbols can differ signiﬁcantly
for different pairs of source and target lexicons within the sentence. This is because the appearances
of particular words at various positions within a sentence differ greatly. For example, essentially no
sentences begin with the uncapitalized word and. Thus, the value of c(c,l) will be zero for every
knowledge base matrix with the ﬁrst lexicon as its source region and the symbol c ¼ and as the
source symbol. However, for many other pairs of lexicons and target symbols, this value will be
large. (A technical point: these disparities are greatest at the early words of a sentence. At later
positions in a sentence, the p(cjl) values tend to be very much the same for the same displacement
between the lexicons — probably the underlying reason why language can be handled well by a ring
architecture.)
After the p(cjl) knowledge, link probabilities have been created for all 190 knowledge bases
using the above procedure, we have then traditionally set any of these quantities which are below
some small value (e.g., in some experiments 0.0001, in others 0.0002, or even 0.0005) to zero; on
Mechanization of Cognition

the basis that such weak links reﬂect random and meaningless symbol co-occurrences. It is
important to state that this policy (and the policy of zeroing out co-occurrence counts below
some set number) is arbitrary and deﬁnitely subject to reﬁnement (e.g., in the case of high-
frequency target symbols, we sometimes accept values below 0.0001 because these low-probability
links can still be quite meaningful). The ﬁnal result of this training process is the formation
of 190 knowledge bases, each containing an average of a million or so individual items of
knowledge.
Given this architecture, with its 20 lexicons and 190 knowledge bases, we can now consider
some thought processes using it. The simplest is phrase completion. First, we take a coherent,
meaningful, contiguous string of fewer than 20 words, and represent them on the lexicons of the
architecture; beginning with the ﬁrst lexicon. The goal is to use these words as context for selecting
the next word in the string (which might be a punctuation; since these are represented in each of the
lexicons). To be concrete, consider a situation where the ﬁrst three words of a sentence are
provided.
The three words are considered to be assumed facts (Hecht-Nielsen, 2005). They must be
coherent and ‘‘make sense,’’ else the confabulation process will yield no answers. To ﬁnd the
phrase completion, we use the knowledge bases from the ﬁrst, second, and third lexicons to
the fourth. The completion is obtained by carrying out confabulation on the fourth lexicon using
a W3. The answer, if there is one, is then the symbol expressed on the fourth lexicon after
confabulation.
With only three words of context (e.g., The only acceptable), the answer that is obtained will
often be one of a huge number of viable possibilities (alternative, person, solution, ﬂight, car,
seasoning, etc., etc., etc. — which can be obtained as an expectation by simply performing a
C3). Language generation usually involves invoking longer-range or abstract context (expressed in
some manner as a set, or multiple sets of assumed facts that act as constraints on the completions or
continuations) to more precisely focus the meaning content of the language construction (which by
the inherent nature of confabulation, is generally automatically grammatical and syntactically
consistent). This context can arise from the same sentence (e.g., by supplying more or more speciﬁc
words as assumed facts) or from external bodies of language (e.g., from previous sentences; as
considered in Section 3.3.3).
If we supply more assumed facts or more narrowly speciﬁc assumed facts, confabulation can
then supply the best answer from a much more restricted expectation. For example, Mickey and
Minnie will yield only one answer: mouse.
However, using more words in phrase completion (or in sentence continuation; where multiple
successive words are added onto a starting string) introduces some new dilemmas. In particular,
beyond a range of two or three words, the string of words that emerges is likely to be novel in the
sense that some of the early assumed facts may not have knowledge links to distant, newly selected
words in the word string. The design of confabulation architectures and thought processes to handle
this common situation is a key problem that my research group has solved; at least in a preliminary
way. As always, there is no software involved; just proper sequences of thought actions (lexicon
confabulations and knowledge base enablements) that are invoked by the conclusions of previous
confabulations.
For example, consider the assumed facts The canoe trip was going smoothly when all of a
sudden. Such partial sentences will almost certainly not have a next-word symbol that receives
knowledge links from all of the preceding assumed fact symbols. So what procedure shall we use to
select the next word? One answer is to simply go on the preponderance of evidence: select that 12th
lexicon symbol that has the highest input intensity among those symbols which have the maximum
available number of knowledge links. This is accomplished by W. This approach can yield
acceptable answers some of the time; but it does not work as well as one would like. If we were
to attempt sentence continuation with this approach (i.e., adding multiple words), the results are
awful.
68
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

The solution is to invoke two new confabulation architecture elements: a language hierarchy
and consensus building. These are sketched next.
3.3.2
Language Hierarchies
There are many reasons why the architecture of Figure 3.1 does not solve the phrase completion and
sentence continuation problems. First of all, this architecture disallows the learning and application
of standard language constructions such as multi-word conceptual units (e.g., New York Stock
Exchange, which we will refer to as phrases), variable element constructions (VECs, e.g., ___
went to the ___), and pendent clauses (e.g., the success of her daughter was, except for
ordinary daily distractions, foremost on her mind). Standard constructions are important
elements of all human languages (although, they differ and can take on different forms, in different
languages) and a comprehensive architecture must include provisions for learning and representing
them.
For the problems of phrase completion and sentence continuation, the architecture of Figure 3.2
is much more capable than that of Figure 3.1. For example, consider again the problem of ﬁnding
the next word for the assumed fact phrase The canoe trip was going smoothly when all of a
sudden. Now, the ﬁrst thing that happens is that this phrase is parsed, meaning that the words are
re-represented at the phrase level. This happens almost instantly by using the knowledge bases
which proceed from the word level to the phrase level. The parsing process, which is described
next, proceeds in a rapid ‘‘rippling wave’’ of thought processes running from the beginning of the
assumed fact word string to the end.
To start, the ﬁrst word, The, of the string goes up ﬁrst. These links (which in accordance with the
knowledge base design described in the caption of Figure 3.2) only go to the ﬁrst phrase lexicon.
A C1F on this ﬁrst phrase lexicon yields an expectation consisting of those symbols which
represent phrases that begin with the word The. The second word lexicon then sends links upward
to the ﬁrst and second phrase regions from the symbol for canoe. C1Fs on phrase regions, one and
Figure 3.2
Single-sentence hierarchical confabulation architecture for proper English phrase or sentence com-
pletion. The lower row of lexicons is used to represent words, as in the architecture of Figure 3.1. Again, knowledge
bases link each of the ﬁrst 19 of these 20 word-level lexicons to all of the lexicons to their right. Positioned exactly
above the word-level lexicon row is a row of 20 phrase-level lexicons. These phrase lexicons represent word
groups (and other standard language constructions, although these will not be discussed much in this introductory
chapter). Each phrase lexicon has at least 126,000 symbols (63,000 single words and punctuations and the 63,000
most common multiple word groups). Knowledge bases connect each phrase lexicon to each of the phrase lexicons
which follow it. Knowledge bases also connect each phrase lexicon to all of the word lexicons except those that lie
to its left. Finally, knowledge bases connect each word region with all of the phrase regions except those that lie to
its right. This architecture has a total of 800 knowledge bases. On average, each knowledge base contains roughly
a million individual items of knowledge. The capability of this architecture is a practical demonstration of the main
premise of the author’s theory of vertebrate cognition; namely, that lots of simple knowledge, along with a single,
simple, information processing operation can implement all of cognition.

two then do two things: on phrase region one, only the symbol for The remains (since The canoe,
nor any further extension of it, is not in the phrase lexicon — for brevity, the manner in which the
phrase lexicon itself, and the additional knowledge bases of the Figure 3.2 architecture, are derived
using word-level knowledge — this process too is totally confabulation-implemented and does not
use any linguistic knowledge — is not described here). This parsing process continues down the
phrase lexicons (each possessing 126,008 symbols), quickly yielding the parse (with the phrase
symbol numbers in parentheses): The(8) canoe(25085) trip(1509) {was going}(63957)
smoothly(9723) when(64) all(56) {of a sudden}(69902). Thus, phrase lexicons 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7,
8, and 9 have symbols active on them (each phrase is represented on the lexicon immediately above
its ﬁrst word). All the other phrase regions have no symbols active on them. Note that if the last
word (sudden) of the assumed fact phrase were not present, that phrase lexicon 9 would not have a
single phrase active on it; but would have several (representing all of the phrases that begin with of
a: e.g., of a, of a kind, of a sudden, of a sort, etc.). I thank my colleague Robert W. Means for
implementing and providing the details of this example.
The above processing sounds like it would take a long time. But remember that thinking is just
like moving. When you throw a baseball many tens of muscles are being commanded in parallel in a
precisely timed and coordinated way. The above thought process (‘‘parse sentence’’) is stored,
recalled, and executed just like a motor action such as throwing a baseball. The initiation of each
involved knowledge base activation and confabulation happens in close succession in a ‘‘ripple’’ of
processing that rapidly moves from the left end of the architecture to the right; terminating at the
end of the assumed fact phrase. The entire parsing process is completed in just a small multiple
of one knowledge base transmission time. Like some movement actions (e.g., dribbling a basket-
ball); thought actions are often divided up into small ‘‘macro’’ segments which, depending upon
their outcome (i.e., which symbol wins the confabulation competition), trigger alternative next-
segments.
As discussed in the Appendix, a key concept of hierarchical architecture design is the prece-
dence principle. There, it was discussed in the context of the constitution of individual symbols
within a single lexicon. However, the same principle holds between lower and higher abstraction
level lexicons within a hierarchy (such as that of Figure 3.2). In this expanded form, what the
precedence principle says is that as soon as content that is represented at a lower level of a hierarchy
is re-represented at a higher level, the involved active lower-level lexicon symbols must be shut off.
This is implemented in human cerebral cortex by use of the conclusion–action principle (see
Section 3.A.6).
In the case of the precedence principle, the action which is triggered by the expression of a
phrase representation symbol is to shut off the lexicons which supplied words to the phrase that the
symbol represents. For example, if the phrase that emerges from the parse has three words, the word
lexicon directly underneath the phrase lexicon, as well as the next two lexicons to its right, are shut
off (they stop expressing their word symbols). If the phrase has only one word, a different action is
triggered: namely, only shutting off the lexicon directly beneath. And so on. Note that these action
commands are not issued until the choices have narrowed to a single symbol; since it is only then
that the conclusion–action principle operates. This is a concrete example of how thought is not
software. It is a series of sets of action commands; each set being immediately originated (issued to
action nuclei) when a ﬁrm confabulation conclusion is reached (i.e., each conclusion has its own set
of action commands that are permanently associated with it, and which are originated every time
that conclusion is expressed as the lone ﬁnal result of a confabulation operation by its lexicon).
This example illustrates a thought process that can be launched immediately with no further
evaluation (e.g., by basal ganglia). It also illustrates how we will need to implement the action
command output portion of cognition from the very outset of research. A great deal more could
be said about action command generation and action symbol sequence learning and recall using
confabulation architectures. But this topic would take us beyond the introductory sketch being
attempted in this chapter. Sufﬁce it to say that quite a lot is known about how action sequences can
70
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

be learned (by rehearsal), stored, and recalled using confabulation architectures (e.g., the UCSD
graduate students in my course built a confabulation-based checker-playing system that learned to
play — trigger appropriate actions — by mimicking a skilled human). Confabulation architectures
for appropriately modifying action sequences, in real time, in response to changes in the world state
that occur during execution (a crucial capability if we are to perform in a complicated, real-world
environment) have also been developed.
Obviously, when the conclusion–action principle ‘‘branching’’ capability is combined with an
ability to store and retrieve data (e.g., using short-term, medium-term, long-term memory or
working memory), the cognitive brain passes the test of being, at least conceptually, capable of
universal computation in the Turing sense. However, the very limited ‘‘RAM memory’’ or ‘‘tape
memory’’ available for immediate reading and writing probably limits the value of this capability.
Certainly, as demonstrated in Hecht-Nielsen (2005), logical reasoning in Aristotelian information
environments is carried out directly by confabulation (cogency maximization); without need for
any recourse to computer principles. Nonetheless, a human with a paper and pencil (to supplement
the extremely limited ‘‘RAM memory’’ available in the brain) can easily learn to carry out thought
processes that will accurately simulate operation of a computer. However, such a ‘‘human-imple-
mented computer’’ is to a modern desktop electronic computer as a unicycle is to racecar.
Given the parse of an assumed fact phrase (say, the ﬁrst few words of a sentence), we can then
use the architecture of Figure 3.2 to carry out ‘‘phrase completion’’ (as in Hecht-Nielsen, 2005). The
ﬁrst step is to build an expectation in the phrase lexicon above the next-word’s lexicon by activating
the knowledge bases between the last active phrase lexicon of the parse and that ‘‘target’’ phrase
lexicon and doing a C1F. This ﬁrst step exploits the fact that adjacent phrases are usually highly
coherent and it would be rare indeed for the next phrase to not receive knowledge links from the last
known phrase of the parse. The result of this ﬁrst step is an expectation on the target phrase lexicon
containing all of the reasonable next phrases. Note that the last-phrase lexicon of the parse may
itself have an expectation containing multiple symbols which themselves could contain the next
word.
For example, as above, if sudden were not present in the starting word string phrase: The
canoe trip was going smoothly when all of a sudden, the last-phrase lexicon would have an
expectation with multiple phrases, including: all of a, all of a sort, all of a sudden, all of a kind,
etc. If, for example, all of these symbols represent multi-word phrases then the target phrase lexicon
expectation will automatically be empty (since none of the phrases in the last-phrase lexicon’s
expectation will have any knowledge links to symbols of that lexicon). If this is not clear, using
Figure 3.2, work out some examples using a diagram on a piece of paper. This is a perfect example
of how all thought processes are conclusion-driven.
The expectations established by the above process then send output through their knowledge
links to the ﬁrst unﬁlled word lexicon; where an expectation is formed by a C1F. Since this word
lexicon is the next one after the last assumed fact word lexicon, we can again assume that the symbols
in this expectation represent all reasonable possibilities for the next word of the continuation. Then
knowledge linking the rest of the parsed phrase symbols to the word lexicon is used with a W to select
that word symbol in the expectation which is most consistent with this additional context. Here again,
there are many possible things that could go on (e.g., knowledge links may or may not exist from
various phrase symbols to words of the expectation); yet, whatever the situation, this process works
better than that using the architecture of Figure 3.1. A bit of time spent thinking about this phrase
completion process with some concrete examples will be most illuminating and compelling. Try to
build some meaningful examples where this process will not work. You won’t be able to.
Why would this phrase completion process (using the architecture of Figure 3.2) be better than
just using the word-level knowledge; as described earlier in connection with Figure 3.1? The
answer is that knowledge links from phrases to words generally have two superior characteristics
over links at the word level. First, the parse often removes a signiﬁcant amount of ambiguity that
can exist in word-level knowledge. For example, the word lexicon symbol for the word New will
Mechanization of Cognition
71

have strong links to the symbol for Stock two word lexicons later (independent of what word
follows it). However, if the parse has activated the phrase New Orleans no such erroneous
knowledge will be invoked. The other advantage of using the parsed representation is that the
knowledge links tend to have a longer range of utility; since they represent originally extended
conceptual collections that have been unitized.
If, as often occurs, we need to restore the words of a sentence to the word lexicons after a parse
has occurred (and the involved word lexicons have been automatically shut off by the resulting
action commands), all we need to do is to activate all the relevant downward knowledge bases and
simultaneously carry out confabulation on all of the word regions. This restores the word-level
representation. If it is not clear why this will work, it may be useful to consider the details of Figure
3.2 and the above description. The fact that ‘‘canned’’ thought processes (issued action commands),
triggered by particular confabulation outcomes, can actually do the above information processing,
generally without mistakes, is rather impressive.
3.3.3
Consensus Building
For sentence continuation (adding more than just one word), we must introduce yet another new
concept: consensus building. Consensus building is simply a set of brief, but not instantaneous,
temporally overlapping, mutually interacting, confabulation operations that are conducted in such
a way that the outcomes of each of the involved operations are consistent with one another in terms
of the knowledge possessed by the system. Consensus building is an example of constraint
satisfaction; a classic topic introduced into neurocomputing in the early 1980s by studies of
Boltzmann machines (Ackley et al., 1985).
For example, consider the problem of adding two more sensible words onto the following
sentence-starting word string (or simply starter): The hyperactive puppy. One approach would
be to simply do a W simultaneously on the fourth and ﬁfth word lexicons. This might yield: The
hyperactive puppy was water; because was is the strongest fourth word choice, and based upon
the ﬁrst three words alone, water (as in drank water) is the strongest ﬁfth word choice. The ﬁnal
result does not make sense.
But what if the given three-word starter was ﬁrst used to create expectations on both the
fourth and ﬁfth lexicons (e.g., using C3Fs). These would contain all the words consistent with
this set of assumed facts. Then, what if W’s on word lexicons four and ﬁve were carried out
simultaneously with a requirement that the only symbols on ﬁve that will be considered are
those which receive inputs from four. Further, the knowledge links back to phrase lexicons
having unresolved expectations from word lexicons four and ﬁve, and those in the opposite
directions, are used as well to incrementally enhance the excitation of symbols that are consistent.
Expectation symbols which do not receive incremental enhancement have their excitation levels
incrementally decreased (to keep the total excitation of each expectation constant at 1.0). This
multiple, mutually interacting, confabulation process is called consensus building. The details of
consensus building, which would take us far beyond the introductory scope of this chapter, are not
discussed here.
Applying consensus building yields sensible continuations of starters. For example, the starter
I was very, continues to: I was very pleased with my team’s, and the starter There was little
continues to: There was little disagreement about what importance. Thanks to my colleague
Robert W. Means for these examples.
3.3.4
Multi-Sentence Language Units
The ability to exploit long-range context using accumulated knowledge is one of the hallmarks of
human cognition (and one of the glaring missing capabilities in today’s computer and AI systems).
This section presents a simple example of how confabulation architectures can use long-range
72
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

context and accumulated knowledge. The particular example considered is an extension of the
architecture of Figure 3.2.
The confabulation architecture illustrated in Figure 3.3 allows the meaning content of a previous
sentence to be brought to bear on the continuation, by consensus building following a starter (shown
in green in Figure 3.3) for the second sentence. The use of this architecture, following knowledge
acquisition, is illustrated in Figure 3.4 (where for simplicity, the architecture of Figure 3.3 is
represented as a ‘‘purple box’’). This architecture, its education, and its use are now brieﬂy explained.
The sentence continuation architecture shown in Figure 3.3 contains two of the sentence modules
of Figure 3.2; along with two new sentence meaning content summary lexicons (one above each
sentence module). The left-hand sentence module is used to represent the context sentence, when it is
present. The right-hand sentence module represents the sentence to be continued.
To prepare this architecture for use, it is educated by selecting pairs of topically coherent
successive sentences, belonging to the same paragraph from a general coverage, multi-billion-word
proper English text corpus. This sentence pair selection process can be done by hand by a human or
using a simple computational linguistics algorithm. Before beginning education, each individual
sentence module was trained in isolation on the sentences of the corpus.
During education of the architecture of Figure 3.3, each selected sentence pair (of which roughly
50 million were used in the experiment described here) is loaded into the architecture, completely
parsed (including the summary lexicon), and then counts were accumulated for all ordered pairs of
symbols on the summary lexicons. The long-term context knowledge base linking the ﬁrst sentence
Figure 3.3
Two-sentence hierarchical confabulation architecture for English text analysis or generation, illus-
trated as the functional machinery of a ‘‘purple box.’’ The sub-architectures for representing the ﬁrst sentence
(illustrated on the left) and that for the second sentence — the one to be continued — illustrated on the right) are
each essentially the same as the architecture of Figure 3.2, along with one new lexicon and 20 new knowledge
bases. The one additional lexicon is shown above the phrase layer of lexicons of each sub-architecture. This
sentence meaning content summary lexicon contains symbols representing all of the 126,000 words and word
groups of the phrase-level lexicons (and can also have additional symbols representing various other standard
language constructions). Once the ﬁrst sentence has been parsed; its summary lexicon has an expectation
containing each phrase-level lexicon symbol (or construction subsuming a combination of phrase symbols) that
is active. The (causal) long-range context knowledge base connects the summary lexicon of the ﬁrst sentence to
the summary lexicon of the second sentence.
Mechanization of Cognition
73

to the second was then constructed in the usual way, using these counts. This education process
takes about 2 weeks on a PC-type computer.
Figure 3.4 illustrates the architecture evaluation process. During each testing episode, two
evaluation trials are conducted: one with no previous sentence (to establish baseline continuation)
and one with a previous sentence (to illustrate the changes in the continuation that the availability
of context elicited). For example, if no previous sentence was provided, and the ﬁrst three words
of the sentence to be continued were The New York, then the architecture constructed: The New
York Times’ computer model collapses . . . (where the words added by this sentence continuation
process without context are shown in green). However, if the previous context sentence Stocks
proved to be a wise investment, was provided, then, again beginning the next sentence with The
New York, the architecture constructed The New York markets traded lower yesterday. . .
(where, as in Figure 3.4, the words added by the sentence continuation process are shown in red).
Changing the context sentence to Downtown events were interfering with local trafﬁc., the
architecture then constructs The New York City Center area where. . . . Changing the context
sentence to Coastal homes were damaged by tropical storms. yields The New York City
Emergency Service System. . . . And so on. Below are some other examples (ﬁrst line —
continuation without context, second line — previous sentence supplied to the architecture, third
line — continuation with the previous sentence context):
Figure 3.4
Use of the ‘‘purple box’’ confabulation architecture of Figure 3.3 for sentence continuation. Following
knowledge acquisition (see text), the architecture’s capabilities are evaluated by a series of testing events (each
consisting of two trials). In Trial 1 (part A of the ﬁgure), three words, termed a sentence starter (shown in blue entering
the architecture from the left) are entered into the architecture; without a previous sentence being provided. The
architecture then uses its acquired knowledge and a simple, ﬁxed, thought process to add some words; which are
shownontherightingreenappendedtothestartingwords.InTrial2(partBoftheﬁgure),apreviouscontextsentence

A good analogy for this system is a child learning a human language. Young children need not
have any formal knowledge of language or its structure in order to generate it effectively. Consider
what this architecture must ‘‘know’’ about the objects of the world (e.g., their attributes and
relationships) in order to generate these continuations; and what it must ‘‘know’’ about English
grammar and composition. Is this the world’s ﬁrst AI system? You decide.
Note that in the above examples the continuation of the second sentence in context was
conducted using an (inter-sentence, long-range context) knowledge base educated via exposure
to meaning-coherent sentence pairs selected by an external agent. When tested with context, using
completely novel examples, it then produced continuations that are meaning-coherent with
the previous sentence (i.e., the continuations are rarely unrelated in meaning to the context
sentence). Think about this for a moment. This is a valuable general principle with endless
implications. For example, we might ask: how can a system learn to carry on a conversation?
Answer: simply educate it on the conversations of a master human conversationalist! There is no
need or use for a ‘‘conversation algorithm.’’ Confabulation architectures work on this monkey-see/
monkey-do principle.
This sentence continuation example reveals the true nature of cognition: it is based on ensem-
bles of properly phased confabulation processes mutually interacting via knowledge links.
Completed confabulations provide assumed facts for confabulations newly underway. Con-
temporaneous confabulations achieve mutual ‘‘consensus’’ via rapid interaction through
knowledge links as they progress (thus the term consensus building). There are no algorithms
anywhere in cognition. Only such ensembles of confabulations. This illustrates the truly
alien nature of cognition in comparison with existing neuroscience, computer science, and AI
concepts.
In speech cognition (see Section 3.4), elaborations of the architecture of Figure 3.3 can be used
to deﬁne expectations for the next word that might be received (which can be used by the acoustic
components of a speech understanding system); based upon the context established by the previous
sentence and previous words of the current sentence which have been previously transcribed. For
text generation (a generalization of sentence continuation, in which the entire sentence is completed
with no starter), the choices of words in the second sentence can now be inﬂuenced by the context
78
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

established by the previous sentence. The architecture of Figure 3.3 generalizes to using larger
bodies of context for a variety of cognition processes.
Even more abstract levels of representation of language meaning are possible. For example,
after years of exposure to language and co-occurring sensory and action representations, lexicons
can form that represent sets of commonly encountered lower-abstraction-level symbols. Via the
SRE mechanism (a type of thought process), such symbols take on a high level of abstraction, as
they become linked (directly, or via equivalent symbols) to a wide variety of similar-meaning
symbol sets. Such symbol sets need not be complete to be able to (via confabulation) trigger
activation of such high-abstraction representations. In language, these highest-abstraction-level
symbols often represent words! For example, when you activate the symbol for the word joy, this
can mean joy as a word, or joy as a highly abstract concept. This is why in human thought the most
exalted abstract concepts are made speciﬁc by identifying them with words or phrases. It is also
common for these most abstract symbols to belong to a foreign language. For example, in English
speaking lands, the most sublime abstract concepts in language are often assigned to French, or
sometimes German, words or phrases. In Japanese, English or French words or phrases typically
serve in this capacity.
High-abstraction lexicons are used to represent the meaning content of objects of the
mental world of many types (language, sound, vision, tactile, etc.). However, outside of the
language faculty, such symbols do not typically have names (although they are often strongly
linked with language symbols). For example, there is probably a lexicon in your head with a
symbol that abstractly encodes the combined taste, smell, surface texture, and masticational feel
of a macaroon cookie. This symbol has no name, but you will surely know when it is being
expressed!
3.3.5
Discussion
A key observation is that confabulation architectures automatically learn and apply grammar, and
honor syntax; without any in-built linguistic structures, rules, or algorithms. This strongly suggests
that grammar and syntax are ﬁctions dreamed up by linguists to explain an orderly structure that is
actually a requirement of the mechanism of cognition. Otherwise put, for cognition to be able, given
the limitations of its native machinery, to efﬁciently deal with language, that language must have a
structure which is compatible with the mathematics of confabulation and consensus building. In this
view, every functionally usable human language must be structured this way. Ergo, universal
appearance of some sort of grammar and syntactic structure in all human languages.
Thus, Chomsky’s (1980) famous long search for a universal grammar (which must now be
declared over) was both correct and incorrect. Correct, because if you are going to have a language
that cognition can deal with at a speed suitable for survival, grammar and syntactic structure are
absolute requirements (i.e., languages that don’t meet these requirements will either adapt to do so,
or will be extincted with their speakers). Thus, grammar is indeed universal. Incorrect, because
grammar itself is a ﬁction. It does not exist. It is merely the visible spoor of the hidden native
machinery of cognition: confabulation, antecedent support knowledge, and the conclusion–action
principle.
3.4
SOUND COGNITION
Unlike language, which is the centerpiece and masterpiece of human cognition, all the other
functions of cognition (e.g., sensation and action) must interact directly with the outside world.
Sensation requires conversion of externally supplied sensory representations into symbolic repre-
sentations and vice versa for actions. This section, and the next (discussing vision), must therefore
discuss not only the confabulation architectures used, but also cover the implementation of this
Mechanization of Cognition
79

transduction process; which is necessarily different for each of these cognitive modalities. Readers
are expected to have a solid understanding of traditional speech signal processing and speech
recognition.
3.4.1
Representation of Multi-Source Soundstreams
Figure 3.5 illustrates an ‘‘audio front end’’ for transduction of a soundstream into a string of ‘‘multi-
symbols;’’ with a goal of carrying out ultra-high-accuracy speech transcription for a single speaker
embedded in multiple interfering sound sources (often including other speakers). The description of
this design does not concern itself with computational efﬁciency. Given a concrete design for such a
system, there are many well-known signal processing techniques for implementing approximately
the same function, often orders of magnitude more efﬁciently. For the purpose of this introductory
treatment (which, again, is aimed at illustrating the universality of confabulation as the mechan-
ization of cognition), this audio front-end design does not incorporate embellishments such as
binaural audio imaging.
Referring to Figure 3.5, the ﬁrst step in processing is analog speech lowpass ﬁltering (say, with a
ﬂat, zero-phase-distortion response from DC to 4 kHz, with a steep rolloff thereafter) of the high-
quality (say, over 110 dB dynamic range) analog microphone input. Following bandpass ﬁltering,
the microphone signal is sampled with an (e.g., 24-bit) analog to digital converter operating at a
16 kHz sample rate. The combination of high-quality analog ﬁltering, sufﬁcient sample rate (well
above the Nyquist rate of 8 kHz) and high dynamic range, yield a digital output stream with almost
no artifacts (and low information loss). Note that digitizing to 24 bits supports exploitation of the
wide dynamic ranges of modern high-quality microphones. In other words, this dynamic range will
make it possible to accurately understand the speech of the attended speaker, even if there are much
higher amplitude interferers present in the soundstream.
The 16 kHz stream of 24-bit signed integer samples generated by the above preprocessing (see
Figure 3.5) is next converted to ﬂoating point numbers and blocked up in time sequence into 8000-
sample windows (8000-dimensional ﬂoating point vectors), at a rate of one window for every
10 ms. Each such sound sample vector X thus overlaps the previous such vector by 98% of its length
(7840 samples). In other words, each X vector contains 160 new samples that were not in the
previous X vector (and the ‘‘oldest’’ 160 samples in that previous vector have ‘‘dropped off the
left end’’).

As shown in Figure 3.5, the 100 Hz stream of sound sample vectors then proceeds to a sound
feature bank. This device is based upon a collection of L ﬁxed, 8000-dimensional ﬂoating point
feature vectors: K1, K2, . . . , KL (where L is typically a few tens of thousands). These feature
vectors represent a variety of sound detection correlation kernels. For example: gammatone
wavelets with a wide variety of frequencies, phases, and gamma envelope lengths, broadband
impulse detectors; fricative detectors; etc. When a sound sample vector X arrives at the feature bank
the ﬁrst step is to take the inner product of X with each of the L feature vectors; yielding L real
numbers: (X  K1), (X  K2), . . . , (X  KL). These L values form the raw feature response vector. The
individual components of the raw feature response vector are then each subjected to further
processing (e.g., discrete time linear or quasi-linear ﬁltering), which is customized for each of
the L components. Finally, the logarithm of the square of each component of this vector is taken.
The net output of the sound feature bank is an L-component non-negative primary sound symbol
excitation vector S (see Figure 3.5). A new S vector is issued in every 10 ms.
The criteria used in selection of the feature vectors are low information loss, sparse represen-
tation (a relatively small percentage of S components meaningfully above zero at any time due to
any single sound source), and low rate of individual feature response to multiple sources. By this
latter it is meant that, given a typical application mix of sources, the probability of any feature
which is meaningfully responding to the incoming soundstream at a particular time being stimu-
lated (at that moment) by sounds from more than one source in the auditory scene is low. The net
result of these properties is that S vectors tend to have few meaningfully nonzero components per
source, and each sound symbol with a signiﬁcant excitation is responding to only one sound source
(see Sagi et al., 2001 for a concrete example of a sound feature bank).
Figure 3.6 illustrates a typical primary sound symbol excitation vector S. This is the mechanism
of analog sound input transduction into the world of symbols. A new S vector is created 100 times
per second. S describes the content of the sound scene being monitored by the microphone at that
moment. Each of the L components of S (again, L is typically tens of thousands) represents the
response of one sound feature detector (as described above) to this current sonic scene.
S is composed of small, mostly disjoint (but usually not contiguous), subsets of excited sound
symbol components — one subset for each sound source in the current auditory scene. Again, each
excited symbol is typically responding to the sound emanating from only one of the sound sources
in the audio scene being monitored by the microphone. While this single-source-per-excited-
symbol rule is not strictly true all the time, it is almost always true (which, as we will see, is all
that matters). Thus, if at each moment, we could somehow decide which subset of excited symbols
of the symbol excitation vector to pay attention to, we could ignore the other symbols and thereby
focus our attention on one source. That is the essence of all initial cortical sensory processing
(auditory, visual, gustatory, olfactory, and somatosensory): ﬁguring out, in real-time, which
primary sensor input representation symbols to pay attention to, and ignoring the rest. This
ubiquitous cognitive process is termed attended object segmentation.
Figure 3.6
Illustration of the properties of a primary sound symbol excitation vector S (only a few of the L
components of S are shown). Excited symbols have thicker circles. Each of the four sound sources present (at the
moment illustrated) in the auditory scene being monitored is causing a relatively small subset of feature symbols to
be excited. Note that the symbols excited by sources 1 and 3 are not contiguous. That is typical. Keep in mind that
the number of symbols, L (which is equal to the number of feature vectors) is typically tens of thousands; of which
only a small fraction are meaningfully excited. This is because each sound source only excites a relatively small
number of sound features at each moment and typical audio scenes contain only a relatively small number of sound
sources (typically fewer than 20 monaurally distinguishable sources).

3.4.2
Segmenting the Attended Speaker and Recognizing Words
Figure 3.7 shows a confabulation architecture for directing attention to a particular speaker in a
soundstream containing multiple sound sources and also recognizing the next word they speak. For
a concrete example of a simpliﬁed version of this architecture (which nonetheless can competently
carry out these kinds of functions; see Sagi et al., 2001). This architecture will sufﬁce for the
purposes of this introduction; but would need to be further augmented (and streamlined for
computational efﬁciency) for practical use.
Each 10 ms a new S vector is supplied to the architecture of Figure 3.7. This S vector is directed
to one of the primary sound lexicons; namely, the next one (moving from left to right) in sequence
after the one which received the last S vector. It is assumed that there are a sufﬁcient number of
lexicons so that all of the S vectors of an individual word have their own lexicon. Of course, this
requires 100 lexicons for each second of word sound input, so a word like antidisestablishmentar-
ianism will require hundreds of lexicons. For illustrative purposes, only 20 primary sound lexicons
are shown in Figure 3.7. Here again, in an operational system, one would simply use a ring of
lexicons (which is probably what the cortical ‘‘auditory strip’’ common to many mammals,
including humans [Paxinos and Mai, 2004], probably is — a linear sequence of lexicons which
functionally ‘‘wraps around’’ from its physical end to its beginning to form a ring).
The architecture of Figure 3.7 presumes that we know approximately when the last word ended.
At that time, a thought process is executed to erase all of the lexicons of the architecture, feed in
expectation-forming links from external lexicons to the next-word acoustic lexicon (and form the
next-word expectation), and redirect S vector input to the ﬁrst primary sound lexicon (the one on the
far left). (Note: As is clearly seen in mammalian auditory neuroanatomy, the S vector is wired to all
portions (lexicons) of the strip in parallel. The process of ‘‘connecting’’ this input to one selected
lexicon (and no other) is carried out by manipulating the operating command of that one lexicon.
Without this operate command input manipulation, which only one lexicon receives at each
moment, the external sound input is ignored.)
The primary sound lexicons have symbols representing a statistically complete coverage of the
space of momentary sound vectors S that occur in connection with auditory sources of interest,
when they are presented in isolation. So, if there are, say 12 sound sources contributing to S, then we
would nominally expect that there would be 12 sets of primary sound lexicon symbols responding
to S (this follows because of the ‘‘quasiorthogonalized’’ nature of S, for example, as depicted in
Figure 3.7
Speech transcription architecture. The key components are the primary sound lexicons, the sound
phrase lexicons, and the next-word acoustic lexicon. See text for explanation.
82

Figure 3.6). Mathematically, the symbols of each primary sound lexicon are a vector quantizer
(Zador, 1963) for the set of S vectors that arise, from all sound sources that are likely to occur,
when each source is presented in isolation (i.e., no mixtures). Among the symbol sets that are
responding to S are some that represent the sounds coming from the attended speaker. This
illustrates the critically important need to design the acoustic front-end so as to achieve this sort
of quasiorthogonalization of sources. By conﬁning each sound feature to a properly selected time
interval (a subinterval of the 8000 samples available at each moment, ending at the most
recent 16 kHz sample), and by using the proper postﬁltering (after the dot product with the feature
vector has been computed) this quasiorthogonalization can be accomplished. (Note: This scheme
answers the question of how brains carry out ‘‘independent component analysis’’ [Hyva¨rinen et al.,
2001]. They don’t need to. Properly designed quasiorthogonalizing features, adapted to the pure
sound sources that the critter encounters in the real world, map each source of an arbitrary mixture
of sources into its own separate components of the S vector. In effect, this is essentially a sort of
‘‘one-time ICA’’ feature development process carried out during development and then essentially
frozen (or perhaps adaptively maintained). Given the stream of S vectors, the confabulation
processing which follows (as described below) can then, at each moment, ignore all but the attended
source-related subset of components, independent of how many, or few, interfering sources
are present. Of course, this is exactly what is observed in mammalian audition — effortless
segmentation of the attended source at the very ﬁrst stage of auditory (or visual or somatosensory,
etc.) perception.
The expectation formed on the next-word acoustic lexicon of Figure 3.7 (which is a huge
structure, almost surely implemented in the human brain by a number of physically separate
lexicons) is created by successive C1Fs. The ﬁrst is based on input from the speaker model
lexicon. The only symbols (each representing a stored acoustic model for a single word — see
below) that then remain available for further use are those connected with the speaker currently
being attended to.
The second C1F is executed in connection with input from the language module word lexicon
that has an expectation on it representing possible predictions of the next word that the speaker will
produce (this next-word lexicon expectation is produced using essentially the same process as was
described in Section 3.3 in connection with sentence continuation with context). (Note: This is an
example of the situation mentioned above and in the Appendix, where an expectation is allowed to
transmit through a knowledge base.) After this operation, the only symbols left available for use on
the next-word acoustic lexicon are those representing expected words spoken by the attended
speaker. This expectation is then used for the processing involved in recognizing the attended
speaker’s next word.
As shown in Figure 3.7, knowledge bases have previously been established (using pure source,
or well-segmented source, examples) to and from the primary sound symbol lexicons with the
sound phrase lexicons and to and from these with the next-word acoustic lexicon. Using these
knowledge bases, the expectation on the next-word acoustic lexicon is transferred (as described
immediately above) via the appropriate knowledge bases, to the sound phrase lexicons, where
expectations are formed; and from these to the primary sound lexicons, where additional expect-
ations are formed. It is easy to imagine that, since each of these transferred expectations is typically
much larger than the one from which it came, that by the time this process gets to the primary sound
lexicons, the expectations will encompass almost every symbol. THIS IS NOT SO! While these
primary lexicon expectations are indeed large (they may encompass many hundreds of symbols),
they are still only a small fraction of the total set of tens of thousands of symbols. Given these
transfers, which actually occur as soon as the recognition of the previous word is completed —
which is often long before its acoustic content ceases arriving, the architecture is prepared for
detecting the next word spoken by the attended speaker.
Mechanization of Cognition
83

As each S vector arrives at the architecture of Figure 3.7, it is sent to the proper lexicon in
sequence. For simplicity, let us assume that the ﬁrst S vector associated with the initial sound
content of the next word is sent to the ﬁrst primary sound lexicon (if it goes to the ‘‘wrong’’ lexicon
or is missed altogether, it does not matter much — as will be explained below). Given that the ﬁrst
primary sound lexicon has an expectation, and that the only symbols in this expectation are those
that represent sounds that a speaker of this type would issue (we each have hundreds of ‘‘canonical
models’’ of speakers having different accents and vocal apparati, and most of us add to this store
throughout life) when speaking early parts of one of the words we are expecting. Again note that,
because of the orthogonalized nature of the S vector and the pure-signal nature of the primary
feature symbols, each of the symbols in this expectation will typically represent sounds having only
a tiny number of S vector components that are nonzero. Each symbol in a primary sound lexicon is
expressed as a unit vector having these small number of components with coefﬁcients near 1, and
all other components at zero. The lexicon takes the inner product of each symbol’s vector
expression with S and this is then used as that symbol’s initial input excitation (this is how symbols
get excited by sensory input signals; in contrast to how symbols get excited by knowledge
links from other symbols, which was discussed in Section 3.1). We have now completed the
transition from acoustic space to symbol space.
Notice that the issue of signal level of the attended source has not been discussed. As described
in Section 3.3.1, each S vector component has its amplitude expressed on a logarithmic scale
(based on ‘‘sound power amplitudes’’ ranging across many orders of magnitude). Thus, on this
scale, the inner product of S with a particular symbol’s unit vector will still (because of the linear
nature of the inner product) be substantial, even if the attended source sounds are tens of dB below
those of some individual interferers. Thus, with this design, attending to weak, but distinct, sources
is generally possible. These are, of course, the characteristics we as humans experience in our own
hearing. Further, in auditory neuroscience, such logarithmic coding of sound feature response
signals (in particular, those from the brainstem auditory nuclei to the medial geniculate nucleus,
which are the auditory signals analogous to the components of S) is well established (Oertel
et al., 2002).
During the entire time of the word detection processes, all of the lexicons of the Figure 3.7
architecture are operated in a consensus building mode. Thus, as soon as the S-input excitations are
established on the expectation element symbols of the ﬁrst primary sound lexicon, only those
symbols which received these expectations remain in the expectation (the consensus building is run
faster on the primary sound lexicons, somewhat slower on the sound phrase lexicons, and even
slower on the next-word acoustic lexicon). This process of expectation reﬁnement that occurs
during consensus building is termed honing.
After acoustic input has arrived at each subsequent primary sound lexicon (the pace of
the switching is set by a separate part of the auditory system, which will not be discussed further
here, which synchronizes the pace of S vector formation — no it is not always exactly every 10 ms
— to the recent pace of speech production of the attended speaker), that lexicon’s expectation
is thereby honed and this revised expectation is then automatically transferred to all of the
sound phrase regions that are not on its right (during consensus building, all of the involved
knowledge bases remain operational). This has the effect of honing some of the sound phrase
lexicon expectations, which then are transferred to the next-word acoustic lexicon; honing its
expectation.
This process works in reverse also. As higher-level lexicon expectations are honed, these are
transferred to lower levels, thereby reﬁning those lower-level expectations. Note that if occasional
erroneous symbols are transferred up to the sound phrase lexicons, or even from the phrase lexicons
to the next-word acoustic lexicon, this will not have much effect. That is because the process of
consensus building effectively ‘‘integrates’’ the impact of all of the incoming transfers on the
symbols of the original expectation. Only when a phrase region has honed its symbol list down to
84
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

one symbol (which then becomes active) is a ﬁnal decision made at that level. Similarly, only at the
point where the expected word duration has been reached does the next-word acoustic lexicon make
a decision (or, it can even transfer a small expectation back to the language module – which is one
way that robust operation can be aided).
Figure 3.8 illustrates the consensus building process on the next-word acoustic lexicon as the S
vector is directed to each subsequent primary sound lexicon in turn. As honed expectations are
transferred upward, the expectation of the next-word acoustic lexicon is itself honed. This honed
expectation is then transferred downward to reﬁne the expectations of the as-yet-unresolved sound
phrase and primary sound layer lexicons. These consensus building interactions happen dynamic-
ally in continuous time as the involved operation commands are slowly tightened. This again
illustrates the almost exact analogy between thought and movement. As with a movement, these
smoothly changing, precisely controlled, consensus building lexicon operate commands are
Figure 3.8
Consensus building process on the next-word acoustic lexicon (see Figure 3.7). Initially, symbols in
the next-word expectation (green dots in the left-most representation of the lexicon state) are established by
knowledge link inputs from the speaker model lexicon and from the language module. As consensus building
progresses, transfers of honed expectations from sound phrase lexicons (which themselves are receiving transfers
from primary sound lexicons) hone this initial expectation, as illustrated here moving from left to right. Yellow-ﬁlled
circles represent symbols that were not part of the initial expectation. These are locked at zero excitation. The color
chart on the left shows the positive excitation scale from lowest on the bottom to highest on top. Some of the initial
expectation symbols become progressively promoted to higher levels of excitation (the sum of all symbol excita-
tions is roughly constant during consensus building). Others go down in excitation (it is possible for a symbol to
change nonmonotonically, but that is not illustrated here). In the end state of the lexicon (far right) one symbol (red)
has become active — this symbol represents the word that has been detected. Keep in mind that in a real
architecture there would typically be tens of thousands of symbols and that only a few percent, at most, would
be part of the initial expectation.
Mechanization of Cognition

generated by a set of lexicons (in frontal cortex) that specialize in storing and recalling action
symbol sequences.
A common objection about this kind of system is that as long as the expectations keep being
met, the process will keep working. However, if even one glitch occurs, it looks like the whole
process will fall apart and stop working. Then, it will somehow have to be restarted (which is not
easy — for example, it may require the listener to somehow get enough signal to noise ratio to allow
a much cruder trick to work). Well, this objection is quite wrong. Even if the next word and the
next-after-that word are not one of the expected ones, this architecture will often recover and
ongoing speechstream word recognition will continue; as we already proved with our crude initial
version (Sagi et al., 2001). A problem that can reliably make this architecture fail is a sudden major
change in the pace of delivery, or a signiﬁcant brief interruption in delivery. For example, if the
speaker suddenly starts speaking much faster or much slower the mentioned subsystem that
monitors and sets the pace of the architecture’s operation will cause the timing of the consensus
building and word-boundary segmentation to be too far off. Another problem is if the speaker gets
momentarily tongue-tied and inserts a small unexpected sequence of sounds in a word (try this
yourself by smoothly inserting the brief meaningless sound ‘‘BRYKA’’ in the middle of a word at a
cocktail party — the listener’s Figure 3.7 architecture will fail and they will be forced to move
closer to get clean recognitions to get it going again).
A strong tradition in speech recognition technology is an insistence that speech recognizers be
‘‘time-warp insensitive’’ (i.e., insensitive to changes in the pace of word delivery). Well Figure 3.7
certainly is not strongly ‘‘time-warp insensitive,’’ and as pointed out immediately above, neither are
humans! However, modest levels of time warp have no impact, since this just changes the location
of the phrase region (moves it slightly left or right of its nominal position) where a particular phrase
gets detected. Also note that since honed phrase expectations are transferred, it is not necessary for
all of the primary sound symbols of a phrase to be present in order for that phrase to contribute
signiﬁcantly to the ‘‘promotion’’ of the next-word acoustic lexicon symbols that receive links from
it. Thus, many primary symbols can be missed with no effect on correct word recognition. This is
one of the things which happens when we speak more quickly: some intermediate sounds are left
out. For example, say Worcestershire sauce at different speeds from slow to fast and consider the
changes in the sounds you issue.
3.4.3
Discussion
This section has outlined how sound input can be transduced into a symbol stream (actually, an
expectation stream) and how that stream can, through a consensus building process, be interpreted
as a sequence of words being emitted by an attended speaker.
One of the many Achilles’ heels of past speech transcription systems has been the use of a
vector quantizer in the sound-processing front end. This is a device that is roughly the same as the
sound feature bank described in this section, except that its output is one and only one symbol
at each time step (10 ms). This makes it impossible for such systems to deal with multi-source
audio scenes.
The sound processing design described in this section also overcomes the inability of past
speech recognition systems to exploit long-range context. Even the best of today’s speech recog-
nizers, operating in a totally noise-free environment with a highly cooperative speaker, cannot
achieve much better than 96% sustained accuracy with vocabularies over 60,000 words. This is
primarily because of the lack of a way to exploit long-range context from previous words in the
current sentence and from previous sentences. In contrast, the system described here has full access
to the context-exploitation methods discussed in Section 3.3; which can be extended to arbitrarily
large bodies of context.
Building a speech recognizer for colloquial speech is much more difﬁcult than for proper
language. As is well known, children essentially cannot learn to understand speech unless they
86
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

can also produce it (in some way). Undoubtedly, this will hold for systems of the type considered in
this section. Thus, to solve the whole speech language understanding problem, we must also solve
the speech language production problem.
In summary, the confabulation theory of vertebrate cognition seems to provide the basis for
mechanizing sound cognition in a manner that has the familiar characteristics of human sound
cognition.
3.5
VISUAL COGNITION
As with sound, the key challenge of vision is to usefully transduce incoming image information into
symbolic form. Another key part of vision is to build symbolic representations of individual visual
objects that are invariant to useful combinations of selected visual attributes such as pose, lighting,
color, and form. These are the main topics of this section. Ancillary subjects, such as the highly
specialized visual human face recognition system and binocular vision are not discussed. Readers
are expected to have a solid understanding of traditional machine vision.
3.5.1
Building an Eyeball Vision Sensor and its Gaze Controller
Vertebrate vision is characterized by the use of eyeballs. A gaze controller is used to direct the
eye(s) to (roughly repeatable) key points on objects of interest. In this section, we will consider only
monocular, panchromatic, visual cognition in detail.
Figure 3.9 illustrates the basic elements of the confabulation-based vision architecture that
will be discussed in this section. For simplicity, the subject of how pointing of the video camera
sensor will be controlled is ignored. It is assumed that the wide-angle large image camera is ﬁxed
and that everything we want to see and visually analyze is within this sensor’s ﬁxed visual ﬁeld of
view and is of sufﬁcient size (number of pixels) to make its attributes visible at the sensor’s
resolution. For example, imagine a wide-angle, high-resolution video camera positioned about 8 ft
above the pavement at a busy downtown street intersection, pointed diagonally across the inter-
section, viewing the people on the sidewalks and the vehicles on the streets.
Assume that the visual sensor (i.e., video camera) gathers digital image frames, each with many
millions of pixels, at a rate of 30 frames per second. For simplicity, each pixel will be assumed to
have its panchromatic (grayscale) brightness measured on a 16-bit linear digital scale.
The gaze controller of this visual system (see Figure 3.9) is provided with all of the pixels
of each individual frame of imagery. Using this input, it decides whether to select a ﬁxation
point (a particular pixel of the frame) for that frame (it can select at most one). The manner
in which a gaze controller can be built (my laboratory has built one [Hecht-Nielsen and Zhou,
1995] and so have a number of others) is described next. To make the discussion which
follows concrete, consider a situation where our video camera sensor is monitoring a street scene
in a busy downtown area. Each still frame of video contains tens of people and a number of cars
driving by.
The basic idea of designing a gaze controller is to mimic human performance. Let an attentive
human visual observer watch the output of the video sensor on a computer screen. Attach an eye
tracker to the screen to monitor the human’s eye movements. These movements will typically be
saccades — jumps of the eye position between one ﬁxation point and the next. At each ﬁxation
point, the human eye gathers image data from a region surrounding the ﬁxation point. This can
be viewed as taking a ‘‘snapshot’’ or ‘‘eyeball’’ image centered at that ﬁxation point. The human
visual system then processes that eyeball image and jumps to the next ﬁxation point selected by
its gaze director (a function which is implemented, in part, by the superior colliculus of the
brainstem). Visual processing is not carried out during these eyeball jumps. While the human
Mechanization of Cognition
87

observer is viewing the video it is important that they be carrying out whatever speciﬁc task or
tasks that the automated vision system will be asked to carry out (e.g., spotting people, pets,
bicycles, and cars).
After many tens of hours of video have been viewed by the human observer carrying out the
function that the machine visual cognition system will later perform, and their eye movements
have been recorded, this provides a record of their ﬁxation point choices for each still frame of
speciﬁc scene content when that choice was made. This record is then used to train a multi-layer
perceptron (Hecht-Nielsen, 2004) to carry out the gaze control function. The basic idea is simple.
Each frame of high-resolution video is described by an image feature vector V. This feature vector
is produced by ﬁrst taking the inner product of each of a collection of Gabor logons with the image
frame (both considered as vectors of the same dimension). The speciﬁc Gabor logons used in
forming V (each logon is deﬁned by the constants E, F, and G, and by its position and angle of plane
rotation in the image — see Figure 3.10) are now described.
First, we create a ﬁxed rectangular set of gridpoints located at equal pixel spacings across the
entire high-resolution video camera frame (Caid and Hecht-Nielsen, 2001, 2004; Daugman, 1985,
1987, 1988a,b; Daugman and Kammen, 1987; Hecht-Nielsen, 1990; Hecht-Nielsen and Zhou,
1995). For example, if each video camera image frame were a 8,192  8,192 pixel digital image,
with a 16-bit panchromatic grayscale, or equivalently, a 67,108,864-dimensional ﬂoating point real
vector with integer components between 0 and 65,535, then we might have gridpoints spaced every
16 pixels vertically and horizontally, with gridpoints on the image edges, for a total of 513  513 ¼
263,169 gridpoints.
At each gridpoint we create a set of Gabor logons centered at that position, each having a
speciﬁed rotation angle and E, F, and G values. The set of logons at each gridpoint is exactly the
same, save for their translated position. This set, which is now described, is termed a jet (von der
Figure 3.9
Vision cognition architecture. The raw input to the visual system is a wide-angle high-resolution video
camera (large frame shown in the lower right of the ﬁgure). A subimage, of a permanently ﬁxed size (say
1024  1024 pixels) of a single video frame (shown as a square within the large frame), termed the eyeball
image, is determined by the location of its center (depicted by the intersection of crosshairs), known as the ﬁxation
point. The gaze controller uses the entire large frame to select a single ﬁxation point, if it deems that such a
selection is warranted for this large frame (it only attempts to select a ﬁxation point when processing of the last
eyeball image has been completed). For simplicity, it is assumed that the video camera is ﬁxed and is able to see
the entire visual scene of interest (e.g., a camera viewing a busy downtown intersection). The confabulation
architecture used for visual processing is described in the text.

Malsburg, 1990). In the vision work done in my lab we have typically set the ratio E/F to 5/8 and the
G/E ratio to 3p/2 for every logon in every jet (these are the values that seem to be used by domestic
cats; Hecht-Nielsen, 1990).
Each jet consists, for example, of pairs of a sine logon and a cosine logon at each of seven scales
(E ¼ 2, 3, 5, 9, 15, 20, and 35 pixel units) and 16 regularly spaced angular orientations, including
having the major ellipse axis of one logon pair vertical. Thus, each jet at each gridpoint has 224
logons. Again, each individual logon is viewed as a 67,108,864-dimensional ﬂoating point real
vector, with each component value given by the evaluation of its formula (Figure 3.10, properly
translated and rotated) evaluated at the pixel location corresponding to that component (obviously,
with most of its values at pixels distant from the gridpoint very close to zero). Thus, there are a total
of 224  263,169 ¼ 58,949,856 logons in all of the gridpoint jets; almost as many as there are
pixels in the high-resolution camera image.
The image feature vector V of a single camera (assumed to employ a progressive scan) frame
is deﬁned to be the 29,474,928-dimensional vector obtained by ﬁrst calculating the inner product
of each logon of each jet with the image vector, and then, to get each component of V, adding
Figure 3.10
Gabor logon local image features. Logons are deﬁned as images with real-valued pixel brightnesses
(i.e., both positive and negative values are allowed) deﬁned by geometrical plane rotations and translations (in the
image plane) of the canonical two-dimensional functions sin(Gx)/exp(Ex2 þ Fy2) (called a sine logon) and cos(Gx)/
exp(Ex2 þ Fy2) (termed a cosine logon); where E, F, and G are positive constants and x and y are image plane
coordinates in the translated and rotated coordinates of the logon frame. Note that E and F deﬁne the principal axis
lengths of a two-dimensional Gaussian-type ellipsoid and G deﬁnes the spatial frequency of a plane grating (with
oscillations along the x-axis). The ratio E/F is ﬁxed for all logons used. Each individual logon is considered as a (real
valued) digital image, that is as image vectors of the same dimension as the wide-angle video camera frames.
Mechanization of Cognition
89

the squares of the sine and cosine inner products of the logons of the same scale and rotational
orientation in each jet (which reduces the total dimensionality of V to half that of the total
number of logons). (Note: Other mathematical transformations are then applied to each
of these sums to make their values insensitive to lighting gradient slopes and other lighting-
dependent effects — but these details go beyond the scope of this sketch and so are left out —
see Hecht-Nielsen and Zhou, 1995 for examples of such transformations.)
Each component of V essentially represents an estimate of the localized spatial frequency
content of the camera image (at the position of the associated gridpoint) at the spatial frequency
of the involved logon pair, in the direction of oscillation of that pair. It is on the basis of local spatial
frequency structure (which V accurately deﬁnes) that ﬁxation points are chosen by the gaze
controller.
The job of the gaze controller is to learn to mimic the performance of a skilled human observer
performing the visual task that is to be mechanized. The manner in which the gaze controller works
and the method used to train it are now described.
The gaze controller (a perceptron; Hecht-Nielsen, 2004) has 224 inputs and two outputs. The
inputs represent the components of V corresponding to the jet at a particular image gridpoint (the
current position of regard of the gaze controller). The outputs of the gaze controller are estimates of
the a posteriori probability of this gridpoint being chosen by the skilled human as a ﬁxation point
along with the a posteriori probability of this gridpoint not being chosen by the skilled human as a
ﬁxation point. Training of the gaze controller is discussed below; but, to set the stage, the manner in
which the gaze controller is used operationally is described ﬁrst.
Once trained, the gaze controller is used to select a ﬁxation point in a newly acquired video
frame by evaluating each of the V component sets from each of the 263,169 gridpoints of the frame.
If the ﬁrst output of the controller is above a ﬁxed threshold (say, 0.8), and the second output is
below a ﬁxed threshold (say, 0.2), then that gridpoint is selected as a candidate ﬁxation point. If
there are no candidate ﬁxation points for the frame, then that frame is skipped. If there are one or
more, the one with the highest ﬁrst output value is selected as the ﬁxation point. The gaze controller
also has provisions for creating multiple successive ‘‘looks’’ at the same object during visual
training to facilitate learning of pose insensitivity (see below). In operational use, when a visual
object of interest has been ﬁxated on and described, the gaze controller tracks that object’s ﬁxation
points and prevents return to it until the other visual objects of interest in the scene have been
described.
To train the gaze controller, each ﬁxation point example (for which a reference frame is selected
as the deﬁnitive ‘‘image input’’ that the human used — by taking a frame a ﬁxed time increment
right before the beginning of their saccade) has its pixel coordinates (supplied by the frequently-
recalibrated eye tracker) stored with its reference frame. Eventually, many thousands of such
ﬁxation point and reference frame pairs are produced, randomly scrambled to remove possible
content correlations between them, and stored. The V vector for each reference frame is also
calculated and stored with it.
The gaze controller perceptron is trained by marching through the ﬁxation point or reference
frame examples, in sequence, many times. At each training episode, the next ﬁxation point and
reference frame example in sequence is selected and the gridpoint nearest to the ﬁxation point is
located. The jet components of the reference frame V vector for that gridpoint are then extracted
and provided to the perceptron, along with desired outputs 1 and 0, and one backpropagation
training episode using these speciﬁed inputs and outputs is carried out. Another gridpoint, distant
from the ﬁxation point, is then selected and its jet V components are provided to the perceptron,
along with desired outputs 0 and 1, and a second perceptron training episode is carried out using
these inputs and outputs. The training process then moves on to the next ﬁxation point or reference
image example. Thus, this training procedure beneﬁcially utilizes oversampling of the examples of
the class of human-supplied ﬁxation points (Hecht-Nielsen, 2004).

Training is continued until the perceptron learning curve (as calculated by considering the
performance of the perceptron when tested on, say, the last 1000 training examples) reaches a
sufﬁciently low value (say, 80% of the training example pairs would be declared as ﬁxation points
and not ﬁxation points, respectively). Final testing is carried out on hundreds of fresh examples not
used in testing. If, say, 70% of the ﬁnal testing examples are classiﬁed correctly, then the gaze
controller is frozen and ready for service. If not, then additional training is called for. After training,
the outputs are scaled to reﬂect operational class a priori probabilities (Hecht-Nielsen, 2004).
It is natural to doubt that the above procedure would produce a functional gaze controller that
would mimic the performance of a skilled human. But it can! The reason is probably that the human
superior colliculus is essentially a ﬁxed neuronal machine (at least in autonomous operational mode
where no external control is exerted — there are several brain nuclei that can send ‘‘commands’’ to
the superior colliculus which override its indigenous decisions) that is not all that ‘‘smart’’ (it
operates very fast, in what looks like a ‘‘ﬂow through’’ processing mode). Thus, its natural internal
function is capable of being fairly accurately mimicked by a perceptron.
3.5.2
Building the Primary Visual Lexicons and Knowledge Bases
After the gaze controller has ﬁnished its training, it is time to build the rest of the visual system (and
link it up with the language module). The ﬁrst step is to set up the camera and start feeding frames to
the gaze controller. Every time it chooses a ﬁxation point (which is of necessity, a grid point), the V
components of the gridpoints lying within the eyeball image centered at that ﬁxation gridpoint
(Figure 3.9) are gathered to form the eyeball image description vector (or just eyeball vector) U.
Just as in the design of mammalian primary visual cortex, each of the primary visual lexicons is
responsible for monitoring a small local neighborhood of the eyeball image (these neighborhoods
are all regularly spaced, they overlap somewhat, and they completely cover the eyeball image). For
example, using the example numbers provided above, each primary visual lexicon (of which, for
illustration purposes, Figure 3.9 shows 36, but there might actually be say, 81) would monitor the U
components from say, 4900 gridpoints within and adjacent to its neighborhood of the eyeball
image. The vector formed by these selected U components constitutes the input vector to that
lexicon.
Now comes the tricky part! In order to train the primary visual lexicons, it is essential that, while
this training is underway, the images being gathered by the high-resolution video camera have only
ONE VISUAL OBJECT (an object of operational interest) in them; and nothing else. Further, all
visual objects that will ever be of interest to the system must be presented in this manner during this
training phase. As mentioned in the Appendix, in humans, this requirement is met by physically
altering the characteristics of the baby’s eyes after it passes through this stage (during which its
vision is limited in range out to about arm length). Similarly in other mammals. For artiﬁcial visual
cognition, a way must be found to meet this critical requirement. For many applications, motion
segmentation, and rejecting eyeball images with more than one object fragment in them (as
determined by a human educator supervising visual knowledge acquisition), will work.
The symbols of each lexicon are built by collecting input vectors from a huge collection of
eyeball images (selected by the gaze controller from images gathered in the operational visual
environment), but where each eyeball image contains only one object (as described in the previous
paragraph). These input vectors for each lexicon are then used to build a VQ codebook for that
lexicon (Zador, 1963) which is sufﬁciently large so that, as training progresses, very few input
vectors are relatively far (more than the local intra-codebook vector distance) from a codebook
vector. Once this criterion is met, the codebook is frozen and one symbol is created for, and
uniquely associated with, each codebook vector. This is how the primary visual lexicon symbol sets
are developed. As discussed in the Appendix, it can also be useful (but it is not essential) to develop
‘‘complex feature detector’’ symbols and invoke the precedence principle, as in mammalian
primary visual cortex. However, this possibility will be largely ignored here.
Mechanization of Cognition
91

Once the primary lexicon symbol sets are developed, the next step is to develop the knowledge
bases between these lexicons. For simplicity, we can assume that every primary visual lexicon is
connected to every other by a knowledge base.
The primary visual layer (i.e., the primary visual lexicons and the knowledge bases linking
them) knowledge bases are trained using large quantities of new video gathered from the oper-
ational source, with the gaze controller selecting ﬁxation points. Again, it is somehow arranged that
each eyeball image contains only an object of operational interest at the ﬁxation point and no visual
elements of other objects (i.e., the rest of the eyeball image is blank).
As each eyeball image vector U is created and its selected subsidiary components (making up
the 81 primary visual lexicon input vectors) are sent to the primary visual lexicons, each lexicon
expresses an expectation with the, say, 10 symbols whose associated codebook vectors lie closest to
its input vector. Count accumulation then takes place for all (unidirectional) links between pairs of
these expectation symbols lying on different lexicons.
The idea of using the ten closest symbols is based upon the discovery (Caid and Hecht-
Nielsen, 2001, 2004) that jet correlation vectors which are near to one another in the Euclidean
metric (i.e., in the VQ space of a lexicon) represent local visual appearances that are (to a human
observer) visually similar to each other; AND VICE VERSA. This valuable fact was pointed out
in the 1980s by John Daugman (Daugman, 1985, 1987, 1988a,b; Daugman and Kammen, 1987)
(Daugman also invented the iris scan biometric signature). This way, symbols which could
reasonably occur together meaningfully within the same object become linked. This is much
more efﬁcient and effective than if each lexicon simply expressed the one closest symbol;
and yet, because of Daugman’s important principle, no harm can come of this expansion to
multiple symbols. The key point is that counts are kept between each of the combinatorially
many ordered excited symbol pairs (of symbols on different lexicons) involved. The process of
deriving the p(cjl) knowledge link strengths ensures that only the meaningful links are retained
in the end.
As training progresses, the p(cjl) knowledge link strengths are periodically calculated from the
symbol co-occurrence count matrices (of which there is one for each knowledge base). When the
meaningful p(cjl) values stop changing much, training is ended. The primary visual layer is now
complete.
3.5.3
Building the Secondary and Tertiary Visual Layers
After completion of the primary visual layer, it is time to build the secondary and tertiary visual
layers. However, this process again requires that the primary visual layer representation of each
eyeball image pertain to only one object — which can now be accomplished using the primary
layer’s knowledge bases, as described next.
Figure 3.11 shows a portion of a frame from the wide-angle high-resolution panchromatic video
camera containing an eyeball image that has been selected by the gaze controller. Each of the 81
primary visual lexicons shown is receiving its input vector from this eyeball image. The ﬁrst thing
that happens is that each lexicon expresses an expectation consisting of those (again, say, 10)
symbols which were closest to that lexicon’s input vector. (Note: This is similar to a C1F effect,
except that the inputs are not coming from knowledge links, but from ‘‘extra-cortical sensory
afferents.’’ This illustrates, as does the handling of the S vector by primary sound lexicons discussed
in Section 3.4, how the handling of these special external sensory inputs is very similar to the
handling of knowledge link inputs.)
Once the primary visual lexicon expectations are established, knowledge links proceeding from
the central lexicon of the primary layer, and its immediate neighboring lexicons, outward are
enabled (allowing all symbols of all expectations of those lexicons to transmit) and the distal
lexicons that these links target receive C1F commands. Those distal lexicons that do not receive
links to symbols of their (previously established and frozen) expectations describing their portion of
92
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

the eyeball image have all of their symbols shut down and thereby become null (this follows from
the fact, discussed in Section 3.1, that the only symbols of a lexicon with a frozen expectation which
can receive input excitation from a knowledge link are those which belong to the expectation). In
general, the only way that the expectation of an outlying lexicon can have any symbols retained is if
one or more of its expectation symbols codes a local appearance that has been meaningfully seen
before in conjunction with one or more of those expectations of the lexicons proximal to the ﬁxation
point.
A more elaborate version of this process can also be used, in which a ‘‘wave’’ of confabulations
moves outward from the middle of the primary lexicon array to the periphery; with only knowledge
bases spanning one or two inter-lexicon distances being enabled as the wave progresses. This
improves performance because closer-distance related appearances are more likely to have
appeared enough during training to be considered meaningful and be retained.
The astounding thing about this process (which is very fast because all of the distal lexicon
confabulations happen in parallel) is that it effectively SEGMENTS THE OBJECT UPON
WHICH THE FIXATION POINT LIES from all the other image content of the eyeball
image. In other words, ideally, after this segmentation procedure, which is virtually instanta-
neous, only symbols describing local appearance of the attended object (the one selected by the
gaze controller having the ﬁxation point sitting on it) remain in the expectations of the primary
visual layer lexicons. In Figure 3.11, these nonnull lexicons (representing the rectangular
solid shown) are illustrated as diagonally-hatched in magenta. In other words, the only visual
appearance data left on the primary visual layer is that describing the attended object, which
has thereby effectively been segmented and isolated from the surrounding objects (as if cut out
by scissors).
Note that, given the reasonably long reach of the knowledge bases projecting radially outward
from the center of the primary visual layer, even objects which are interrupted by an occluding
foreground object will, in principle, have all of their visible components represented by primary
lexicons (and those coding the interrupting object(s) will be nulled). Also note that the smaller each
primary visual lexicon is (in terms of the fraction of the eyeball image it covers), the better this
Figure 3.11
Object segmentation example. A portion of a wide-angle camera frame is shown. The gaze
controller has ﬁxated upon the upper left back corner of a rectangular solid (shown here in color for clarity). The
eyeball image is shown surrounding the ﬁxation point with the 81 (overlapping — they actually overlap a bit more
than is shown here) ﬁelds of view of the 81 primary visual lexicons shown. As explained in the text, the primary
visual layer knowledge bases can be used to eliminate the lexicon responses to all visual objects except the one
upon which the ﬁxation point lies.
Mechanization of Cognition
93

process will work. Thus, segmentation might work even better if we had 625 primary visual
lexicons (a 25  25 array). The use of more ‘‘complex’’ features, based upon more localized
‘‘simple’’ features (see Appendix), and the precedence principle is one design approach to achiev-
ing some of the beneﬁts of more, smaller, lexicons without actually building them.
Multiple natural questions arise at this point. First, how well does this design actually work in
practice? In other words, how thoroughly does this segmentation process null lexicons coding other
objects and how reliably are the lexicons that code the attended object retained? The short answer is
that I don’t know. The only evidence I have is based upon experiments done in my lab with a very
simple image environment (images of capital Latin alphabetical characters moving about, with
slowly randomly changing spatial and angular velocities, on a plane). In this case, a segmentation
scheme of this basic type worked very well.
In reality, probably not all ﬁxation point objects will segment cleanly. Sometimes irrelevant
lexicons will not be nulled, and relevant lexicons will be. However, because of the nature of
development process for the secondary and tertiary visual lexicon symbol sets, which is described
next, such errors will not matter; as long as these lapses occur randomly and as long as the general
quality of the segmentation is fairly good. We will proceed with the assumption that these
conditions are satisﬁed.
The goal for the secondary lexicon symbols is twofold. First, each such symbol should be
somewhat pose insensitive (i.e., if it responds strongly to an object at one pose it will respond
strongly to the same object at nearby poses). Also, each secondary lexicon symbol should represent
a larger ‘‘chunk’’ of an object than any primary symbol. Such symbols are said to be more holistic
than primary lexicon symbols. Tertiary layer lexicon symbols are to be even more holistic than
secondary layer symbols.
For secondary and tertiary layer development, sequences of camera images containing the same
(operationally relevant) visual object are used. At the beginning of each sequence, we assume that
the gaze director has selected a ﬁxation point on the object. In the subsequent frames of the
sequence, we check to see that in each, one point near the initial ﬁxation point is also given a
high score by the gaze director. If this is true for a signiﬁcant sequence of frames (say, 10 to 20 or
more), then these nearby points on the subsequent frames are designated as the ﬁxation points for
those frames and this sequence of eyeball images is added to our training set for layers two and
three. It is assumed that this set of sequences provides good statistical coverage of the set of all
operationally relevant objects, and that each object is seen in many different, operationally
characteristic poses in the sequences. It is also assumed that the poses of the ﬁxated object in
each sequence are dynamically changing. (Note: This dynamic variation in pose is needed for
training, but is not a requirement for operational use; where objects can be stationary, and yet can
still usually be described with a single look.)
As shown in Figure 3.9, the secondary layer lexicons receive knowledge links from primary
layer lexicons. The arrangement of these links is that a secondary lexicon symbol can only receive a
link from symbols lying on primary lexicons surrounding the position of the secondary lexicon in
the second layer lexicon array (i.e., like the primary lexicon array, the secondary array is envisioned
as also representing, with a regular ‘‘tiling,’’ the eyeball image content of the attended object, but
with each secondary lexicon representing a larger ‘‘chunk’’ of this object than a primary layer
lexicon — since the secondary layer has fewer lexicons than the primary layer). These knowledge
links connect every symbol belonging to each primary lexicon within the ‘‘ﬁeld of view’’ of a
secondary lexicon to every symbol of that secondary lexicon. For each such forward knowledge
link, a link between the same two symbols in the reverse (secondary to primary) direction is also
created. All of these links start out with zero strength.
As mentioned in the Appendix, not all knowledge bases need to have graded p(cjl) strengths.
For many purposes in cognition, it is sufﬁcient for knowledge links to simply be present (essentially
with strength 1) or absent (with effective ‘‘strength’’ 0). These inter-visual-level knowledge links
are of this binary character.
94
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

During each secondary layer training episode, sequences of say, four to six consecutive eyeball
images of the same ﬁxation point on a dynamically pose-changing object of interest (extracted at
random from one of the training set sequences) are used in order. As described above, as each
eyeball image in the sequence is entered, the above segmenting process is applied to it — yielding
expectations on a subset of the primary layer lexicons. After the ﬁrst eyeball image of the ﬁrst
training episode sequence has been so represented, a symbol is formed in each secondary lexicon
and that symbol is bi-directionally connected from and to each of the primary layer symbols to
which it is connected (by setting the relevant knowledge link strengths to 1). The second eyeball
image of the sequence is then entered and segmented. The same secondary lexicon symbols created
using the ﬁrst eyeball image of the sequence are then connected from and to all of the primary
symbols of this processed second eyeball image for which connections exist. And so forth for the
remaining eyeball images of the sequence used on this ﬁrst training episode. On subsequent training
episodes we proceed in exactly the same manner.
Clearly, one symbol is typically going to be added to each secondary lexicon on each training
trial. We stop training when the vast majority of new secondary symbols turn out to be equivalent to
existing symbols — as measured by noting that, of those secondary lexicons which are receiving
knowledge link inputs from primary symbols, each such secondary lexicon already has a symbol
that simultaneously receives links from at least one expectation symbol of each nonnull primary
lexicon from which that secondary lexicon receives a knowledge base. In other words, training is
stopped when the vast majority of segmented eyeball images can be well represented by secondary
symbols which have already been created.
Once training has been stopped, we then use the same training set again for consolidating the
symbols. This involves using the primary symbols representing each eyeball image as inputs to
the secondary lexicons to which they connect by strengthened connections. Whenever multiple
symbols of a secondary lexicon receive links from one primary symbol of each primary lexicon
from which that secondary lexicon receives links, then those secondary lexicon symbols are
merged. Merging simply means that all of the primary to secondary links that went to each of the
symbols being merged now go to the merged symbol (and vice versa for the secondary to primary
links). What merging does is combine symbols which represent intersecting pose–space trajectories
for the same object; thus, increasing the pose-insensitivity of the merged symbol.
Once the secondary layer lexicons are built and merged (and the knowledge bases between
the primary and secondary layers frozen), the last step is to train the knowledge bases between the
secondary layer lexicons. This is done by entering single eyeball images from the training set,
segmenting and representing each image using the primary layer (as during training), carrying out a
W on each secondary lexicon, and recording the symbol co-occurrence counts for each secondary
layer knowledge base.
When all of this is done, the secondary to tertiary knowledge bases (and their inverses) are built
using the same method as described above for the primary to secondary knowledge bases. Except
this time, each training episode uses the entire set of eyeball images of each training set sequence.
The resulting tertiary lexicon symbols are then merged and the tertiary layer inter-lexicon know-
ledge bases are built. This completes development of the vision module.
3.5.4
How Is the Visual Module Used?
After all of the lexicons and knowledge bases of the visual module of Figure 3.9 are built, the
module is ready for use. This subsection brieﬂy sketches how it can be used.
Given a new frame of imagery in which the gaze controller has found a ﬁxation point,
the primary layer of the visual module segments and represents the attended object with expect-
ations; just as during the later phases of training and education. The symbols of the non-null
expectations of primary lexicons then transmit to other primary lexicons and to secondary layer
lexicons via the established knowledge bases. The other primary layer and the secondary layer
Mechanization of Cognition
95

lexicons then create expectations in response to C1Fs. The secondary visual layer expectation
symbols then transmit to other secondary lexicons without expectations (if any there be) and to
tertiary lexicons, again using the knowledge links established during training, and C1Fs establish
expectations on all relevant lexicons. Finally, the knowledge links of the third layer are used to
transmit from the tertiary expectations to any lexicons without expectations, followed by a ﬁnal
round of C1Fs.
The expectations formed by this initial ‘‘feedforward’’ interaction represent all of the symbols
that are known (i.e., established by the knowledge) to be compatible with the combinations of the
symbols in the primary lexicon expectations. At this point, a consensus building process is launched
involving all nonnulled lexicons on all layers and all knowledge bases linking those lexicons. This
consensus building process hones all the expectations until each of the involved lexicons has at
most one symbol left (which is, of necessity, active). This collection of symbols is the vision
module’s representation of the attended visual object.
This tertiary visual object representation has three important properties. First, it has signiﬁcant
pose insensitivity. With high probability, if you changed the pose of the object somewhat, almost
the same set of symbols would be obtained as the object’s representation.
Second, the object has been completed; meaning that the representation has removed the effects
of occluding objects that blocked the view of some portions of the object (of course, the visible
portions of the object must be sufﬁcient for completion by this method).
Third, the representation of the object at the lower levels contains details. For example, if the
object is a truck being viewed from the front, the front grille and headlamps will typically be visible
and will be represented at the primary level. Whereas, the representation of the object at the tertiary
level will not have these details. It will be more abstract (many more speciﬁc truck images would
invoke this same, or a very similar, representation).
3.5.5
Linking the Visual Module with the Language Module
Once the visual module is built, what good is it? By itself, not much. It only becomes useful when it
is linked by knowledge with other cognitive modules. This subsection presents a brief sketch of an
example of how, via instruction by a human educator, a vision module could be usefully linked with
a language module.
A problem that has been widely considered is the automated text annotation of video describing
objects within video scenes and some of those object’s attributes. For example, such annotations
might be useful for blind people if the images being annotated were taken by a camera mounted on a
pair of glasses (and the annotations were synthesized into speech provided by the glasses to the
wearer’s ears via small tubes issuing from the temples of the glasses near the ears).
Figure 3.12 illustrates a simple concept for such a text annotation system. Video input from
the eyeglasses-mounted camera is operated upon by the gaze controller and objects that it
selects are segmented and represented by the already-developed visual module, as described
in the previous subsection. The objects that were used in the visual module development
process were those that a blind person would want to be informed of (curbs, roads, cars, people,
etc.). Thus, by virtue of its development, the visual module will search each new frame of video
for an object of operational interest (because these were the objects sought out by the
human educator who’s examples were used to train the gaze controller perceptron) and then that
object will be segmented, and after consensus building, represented by the module on all of its three
layers.
To build the knowledge links from the visual module to the text module, another human
educator is used. This educator looks at each ﬁxation point object selected by the vision module
(while it is being used out on the street in an operationally realistic manner), and if this is indeed an
object that would be of interest to a blind person, types in one to ﬁve sentences describing that
96
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

object. These sentences are designed to convey to the blind person useful information about the
nature of the object and its visual attributes (information that can be extracted by the human
educator just by looking at the visual representation of the object).
To train the links from the vision module to the language module (every visual lexicon is
afforded a knowledge base to every phrase lexicon), the educator’s sentences are entered, in order,
into the word lexicons of the sentence modules (each of which represents one sentence — see
Figure 3.12); each sentence is parsed into phrases (see Section 3.4); and these phrases are
represented on the sentence summary lexicon of each sentence. Counts are accumulated between
the symbols active on the visual module’s tertiary lexicons and those active on the summary
lexicons. If the educator wishes to describe speciﬁc visual subcomponents of the object, they
may designate a local window in the eyeball image for each subcomponent and supply the
sentence(s) describing each such subcomponent. The secondary and tertiary lexicon symbols
representing the subcomponents within each image are then linked to the summary lexicons of
the associated sentences. Before being used in this application, all of the internal knowledge bases
of the language module have already been trained using a huge text training corpus.
After a sufﬁcient number of education examples have been accumulated (as determined by ﬁnal
performance — described below), the link use counts are converted into p(cjl) probabilities and
frozen. The knowledge bases from the visual module’s lexicons to all of the sentence summary
lexicons are then combined (so that the available long-range context can be exploited by a sentence
in any position in the sequence of sentences to be generated). The annotation system is now ready
for testing.
The testing phase is carried out by having a sighted evaluator walk down the street wearing the
system (yes, the idea is that the entire system is in the form of a pair of glasses!). As the visual
module selects and describes each object, knowledge link inputs are sent to the language module.
These inputs are used, much as in the example of Section 3.3: as context that drives formation of
a sentence (only now there is no starter). Using consensus building (and separate sentence starter
generator and sentence terminator subsystems — not shown in Figure 3.12 and not discussed here
Figure 3.12
Image text annotation. A simple example of linking a visual module with a (text) language module.
See text for description.

97

— for starting and ending the sentence), the language module composes one or more grammatical
sentences that describe the object and its attributes.
The number of sentences is determined by a meaning content critic subsystem (not shown in
Figure 3.12) which stops sentence generation when all of the distinctive, excited, sentence summary
lexicon symbols have been ‘‘used’’ in one or more of the generated sentences.
This sketch illustrates the monkey-see/monkey-do principle of cognition: there is never any
complicated algorithm or software; no deeply principled system of rules or mathematical con-
straints; just confabulation and consensus building. It is a lot like that famous cartoon where
scientists are working at a blackboard, attempting, unsuccessfully, to connect up a set of facts on
the left with a desired conclusion on the right via a complicated scientiﬁc argument spanning the
gap between them. In frustration, one of the scientists erases a band in the middle of the argument
and puts in a box (equipped with input and output arrows) labeled ‘‘And Then a Miracle Occurs.’’
THAT is the nature of cognition.
3.6
DISCUSSION
This chapter has reviewed a ‘‘uniﬁed theory of cognition’’ which purports to explain all aspects of
this vast subject with one type of knowledge and one information processing operation. The hope is
that this discussion has convinced you that this approach to cognition is worthy of more extensive
investigation. Only after language, sound, and vision systems such as those described here have
been built, and widely evaluated and criticized, will a sense begin to emerge that the mechanization
of cognition is truly possible. I am hopeful that the arguments and discussion presented here are
sufﬁciently compelling to make such a research program sensible.

APPENDIX: BIOLOGICAL COGNITION
3.A.1
Introduction
This Appendix sketches the author’s confabulation theory of animal cognition. The discussion is
focused on the biological implementation of cognition in human cerebral cortex and thalamus
(hereinafter, often referred to jointly as thalamocortex).
The enormous diversity of animal life, currently ranging in size from single cells (the smallest
animals which have ever lived) to blue whales (the largest), and ranging in adaptation across a huge
range of biomes, obfuscates its unity. All animal cells function using very similar basic biochemical
mechanisms. These mechanisms were developed once and have been genetically conserved across
essentially all species. Mentation is similar. The basic mechanism of cognition is, in the view of this
theory, the same across all vertebrates (and possibly invertebrates, such as octopi and bees, as well).
The term cognition, as used in this Appendix, is not meant to encompass all aspects of
mentation. It is restricted to (roughly) those functions carried out by the human cerebral cortex
and thalamus. Cognition is a big part of mentation for certain vertebrate species (primates, cats,
dogs, parrots, ravens, etc.), but only a minor part for others (ﬁsh, reptiles, etc.). Frog cognition
exists, but is a minor part of frog mentation. In humans, cognition is the part of mentation of which
we are, generally, most proud; and most want to imitate in machines.
An important concept in deﬁning cognition is to consider function; not detailed physiology. In
humans, the enormous expansion of cerebral cortex and thalamus has allowed a marked segregation
of cognitive function to those organs. Birds can exhibit impressive cognitive functions (Pepperberg,
1999; Weir et al., 2002). However, unlike the case in humans, these cognitive functions are
probably not entirely conﬁned to a single, neatly delimited, laminar brain nucleus. Even so, the
theory hypothesizes that the underlying mathematics of cognition is exactly the same in all
vertebrate species (and probably in invertebrates); even though the neuronal implementation varies

considerably. (This is much as in electronics: the same logic circuit can be implemented with
electromechanical relays, in silicon CMOS circuits, using vacuum tubes, or even using ﬂuidic
devices. While these implementations are physically dissimilar; they are mathematically identical.)
Although not enough is known to create a deﬁnitive list of speciﬁc human cognitive functions,
the following items would certainly be on such a list:

Language
.
Hearing

Seeing

Action (movement process and thought process) origination
This Appendix focuses upon the implementation of cognitive knowledge links, confabulation,
and action command origination by the human cerebral cortex and thalamus. It is assumed that the
reader is familiar with the concepts, terminology, and mathematics of elementary confabulation
(e.g., as discussed in Hecht-Nielsen, 2005) and with elementary human neuroanatomy and neuro-
physiology (e.g., as presented in Mai et al., 2004; Mountcastle, 1998; Nicholls et al., 2001; Nolte,
1999; Paxinos and Mai, 2004; Steward, 2000). The theory hypothesizes that all human cognitive
functions, including those listed above, are implemented using the basic confabulation machinery
sketched in this Appendix. To keep this Appendix focused, the manner in which confabulation can
be used to carry out speciﬁc cognitive functions (such as those listed above) will not be discussed
here, as this is essentially the material covered in the main body of the chapter.
To keep the size of this Appendix reasonable, and to avoid speculations about ﬁne details, the
treatment will avoid extensive discussion at the level of individual neurons, synapses, and axonal
signals. For example, only simpliﬁed gross or summary aspects of interneuronal signaling processes
and neurodynamic processes will be discussed. Yet, the theory contends that the ﬁne details jibe
with these slightly larger-scale functional descriptions. Consensus building (dynamically interact-
ing confabulations taking place contemporaneously in multiple lexicons), which the theory hy-
pothesizes is the dominant mode of use of confabulation in human cognition, will only be brieﬂy
mentioned, as a detailed treatment would go beyond the introductory scope of this sketch of the
theory’s biological implementation. At the current time, the theory presented in this Appendix is the
only existing detailed explanation of the operation of cerebral cortex or thalamus, and of human
cognition.
3.A.2
Summary of the Theory
The fundamental hypotheses of the theory are summarized in this section. Subsequent sections
elaborate.
All information processing involved in human cognition is hypothesized to be carried out by
thousands of separate thalamocortical modules; each consisting of a particular small localized patch
of cortex (possibly consisting of disjoint, nonadjacent, subpatches), and a particular, uniquely
paired, small localized zone of thalamus, which are reciprocally connected axonally. These feature
attractor modules (of which human thalamocortex has many thousands) are hypothesized
to each implement a list of (typically thousands of) discrete symbols (which is stable over time,
and can be added to) and to carry out a single symbolic information processing operation called
confabulation. Each symbol is represented by a speciﬁc collection of neurons within the module.
These collections are all about the same size within any single module; but this size varies
considerably, from tens to hundreds of neurons per symbol — a genetically determined value,
between modules located in different parts of the cortex. Any pair of such neuron collections of the
same module, representing two different symbols, typically have a few neurons in common. Each
neuron which participates in such a collection typically participates in many others as well. When
100

considering their function (rather than their biological implementation), each such thalamocortical
module will be referred to as a lexicon.
Each feature attractor module is hypothesized to be controlled by a single graded (i.e., analog-
valued) excitatory control input; exactly in analogy with an individual muscle (each muscle has a
single-graded excitatory control input that, by its value across time, speciﬁes the muscle’s contrac-
tion force history). The theory hypothesizes that properly phased and timed sequences of such
thought control inputs to each member of an ensemble of cortical modules cause them to carry out a
thought process. These thought processes are ‘‘data-independent,’’ much like computer operations
such as numerical addition and Boolean XOR. It is hypothesized that vast numbers of such thought
processes (and movement processes) are learned by rehearsal training and stored in a hierarchical
organization within knowledge bases linking yet other lexicons of cerebral cortex.
Confabulation is implemented in parallel by the neurons of a feature attractor module and is
often completed in a few tens of milliseconds. This is a ‘‘winners take all’’ style of dynamical
competitive interaction between symbols that does not require a ‘‘referee’’ or ‘‘controller’’ to be in
charge. The states of the involved neurons evolve dynamically and autonomously during confabu-
lation via the massively parallel mutual interactions of the involved neurons. The ﬁnal state of each
involved neuron is either excited or active (a small minority of neurons), or almost completely
inactive (the vast majority). The term active (implying a momentary, maximally communicating
state) is deliberately undeﬁned as it involves neuronal signaling details which are not yet known; as
does the term excited (implying a highly, but not maximally, communicating state).
If the outcome of a confabulation is a single symbol, the neurons representing that symbol will
automatically be made active and all other neurons of the module are inactive (not communicating).
However, if multiple symbols result from a confabulation (the outcome is dependent upon multiple
factors, including the time proﬁle of the module control signal — see below), these will be at
different levels of excitation (but not active) and all other symbols will be inactive. Those few
neurons which end up in the excited or active state represent the symbol(s) which ‘‘won’’ the
confabulation competition. These symbols are termed the conclusions of that confabulation oper-
ation. Confabulations frequently end with no excited or active neurons — a conclusion termed the
null symbol — which signiﬁes that no viable conclusion was reached. This ability to decide that
‘‘I don’t know’’ is one of the great strengths of cognition.
The theory hypothesizes that the only knowledge stored and used for cognition within thala-
mocortex takes the form of (indirect, parallel) unidirectional axonal connections between the
population of neurons within one feature attractor module used to represent one symbol and
neurons used to represent a symbol in another feature attractor. Each such link between a pair of
symbols is termed an item of knowledge. The average human is hypothesized to possess billions of
such items of knowledge.
The theory hypothesizes that items of knowledge are immediately established on a temporary
basis when a novel, meaningful, co-occurrence of symbol pair activity occurs during a period of
wakefulness (assuming that those symbols are equipped with the necessary axonal paths with which
a link can be established). If this short-term memory link is selected for deliberate rehearsal during
the next period of sleep, it gets promoted to the status of a medium-term memory. If this medium-
term memory link is revisited on near-term subsequent sleep periods it then gets promoted to a
long-term memory, which will typically last years; as long as the involved tissue remains patent and
not redeployed.
It is hypothesized that each time a thalamocortical module carries out a confabulation which
concludes with the expression of a single active symbol (as opposed to no symbols or multiple
excited symbols), an action command associated with that symbol is immediately issued by a
specialized cortical component of that module (this is the theory’s conclusion–action principle).
Action commands cause muscle and thalamocortical thought module control signals to be sent.
In other words, every time a thought process successfully reaches a single conclusion, a new
movement process and/or thought process is launched (some of which may undergo additional
Mechanization of Cognition
101

evaluation before being ﬁnally executed). This is the theory’s explanation for the origin of all
nonautonomic animal behavior.
As with almost all cognitive functions, actions are organized into a hierarchy, where individual
symbols belonging to higher-level lexicons typically each represent a time-ordered sequence of
multiple lower-level symbols.
Evolution has seen to it that symbols, which when expressed alone launch action commands that
could conﬂict with one another (e.g., carrying out a throwing motion at the same time as trying to
answer the telephone), are grouped together and collected into the same lexicon (usually at a high
level in the action hierarchy). That way, when one such action symbol wins a confabulation (and has
its associated lower-level action commands launched), the others are silent — thereby automati-
cally deconﬂicting all actions. This is why all aspects of animal behavior are so remarkably focused
in character. Each complement of our moving and thinking ‘‘hardware’’ is, by this mechanism,
automatically restricted to doing one thing at a time. Dithering (rapidly switching from one decisive
action (behavioral program) to another, and then back again) illustrates this perfectly.
The thought processes at the lowest level of the action hierarchy are typically carried out
unconditionally at high speed. If single symbol states result from confabulations which take
place as part of a thought process, these symbols then decide which actions will be carried out
next (this happens both by the action commands the expression of these symbols launch, and by the
inﬂuence of these symbols — acting through knowledge links — on the outcomes of subsequent
confabulations; for which these symbols act as assumed facts). Similarly for movements, as
ongoing movements bring about changes in the winning symbols in confabulations in somatosen-
sory cortex — which then alter the selections of the next action symbols in modules in motor and
premotor cortex. This ongoing, high-speed, dynamic contingent control of movement and thought
helps account for the astounding reliability and comprehensive, moment-by-moment adaptability
of animal action.
All of cognition is built from the above discussed elements: lexicons, knowledge bases, and the
action commands associated with the individual symbols of each lexicon. The following sections of
this Appendix discuss more details of how these elements are implemented in the human brain. See
Hecht-Nielsen and McKenna (2003) for some citations of past research that inﬂuenced this theory’s
development.
3.A.3
Implementation of Lexicons
Figure 3.A.1 illustrates the physiology of thalamocortical feature attractor modules. In reality, these
modules are not entirely disjoint, nor entirely functionally independent, from their physically
neighboring modules. However, as a ﬁrst approximation, they can be treated as such; which is
the view which will be adopted here.
Figure 3.A.2 shows more details of the functional character of an individual lexicon. The
cortical patch of the module uses certain neurons in Layers II, III, and IV to represent the symbols
of the module. Each symbol (of which there are typically thousands) is represented by a roughly
equal number of neurons; ranging in size from tens to hundreds (this number deliberately varies, by
genetic command, with the position of the cortical patch of the module on the surface of cortex).
The union of the cortical patches of all modules is the entire cortex, whereas the union of the
thalamic zones of all modules constitutes only a portion of thalamus.
Symbol-representing neurons of the module’s cortical patch can send signals to the glomeruli of
the paired thalamic zone via neurons of Layer VI of the patch (as illustrated on the left side of
Figure 3.A.2). These downward connections each synapse with a few neurons of the thalamic
reticular nucleus (NRT) and with a few glomeruli. The NRT neurons themselves (which are
inhibitory) send axons to a few glomeruli. The right side of Figure 3.A.2 illustrates the connections
back to the cortical patch from the thalamic zone glomeruli (each of which also synapses with a few
neurons of the NRT). These axons synapse primarily with neurons in Layer IV of the patch, which
102
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

subsequently excite other neurons of Layers II, III, and IV. As mentioned above, no attempt to
discuss the details of this module design will be made, as these details are not yet adequately
established and, anyway, are irrelevant for this introductory sketch. Instead, a discussion is now
presented of a simple mathematical model of an attractor network to illustrate the hypothesized
dynamical behavior of a thalamocortical model in response to proper knowledge link and operation
command inputs.
The theory hypothesizes that each thalamocortical module carries out a single information
processing operation — confabulation. This occurs whenever appropriate knowledge link inputs
and the operation command input arrive at the module at the same time. The total time required for
the module to carry out one confabulation operation is roughly 100 msec. Ensembles of mutually
interacting confabulations (instances of consensus building — see the main Chapter) can often be
highly overlapped in time. By this means, the ‘‘total processing time’’ exhibited by such a consensus
building ensemble of confabulations can be astoundingly short — often a small multiple of the
involved axonal and synaptic delays involved; and not much longer than a small number of
individual confabulations. This accounts for the almost impossibly short ‘‘reaction times’’ often
seen in various psychological tests.
Figure 3.A.1
Thalamocortical modules. All cognitive information processing is carried out by distinct, modular,
thalamocortical circuits termed feature attractors; of which two are shown here. Each feature attractor module (of
which human cortex has many thousands) consists of a small localized patch of cortex (which may be comprised of
disjoint, physically separated, sub-patches), a small localized zone of thalamus, and the reciprocal axonal con-
nections linking the two. When referring to its function (rather than its implementation, a feature attractor is termed a
lexicon). Each feature attractor module implements a large stable set of attractive states called symbols, each
represented by a speciﬁc collection of neurons (all such collections within a module are of approximately the same
size). Neuron overlap between each pair of symbols is small, and each neuron involved in representing one symbol
typically participates in representing many symbols. One item of knowledge is a (parallel, two-stage synﬁre) set of
unidirectional axonal connections collectively forming a link between the neurons representing one symbol within
one feature attractor (e.g., the green one shown here) and neurons representing one symbol on a second feature
attractor (e.g., the blue one shown here). The collection of all such links between the symbols of one module
(here the green one), termed the source lexicon, and that of a second (here the blue one), termed the target lexicon,
are termed a knowledge base (here represented by a red arrow spanning the cortical portions of the green and blue
modules).

The mathematical model discussed below illustrates the dynamical process involved in carrying
out one confabulation. Keep in mind that this model might represent strictly cortical neuron
dynamics, module neurodynamics between the cortical and thalamic portions of the module, or
even the overall dynamics of a group of smaller attractor networks (e.g., a localized version of the
‘‘network of networks’’ hypothesis of Sutton and Anderson in Hecht-Nielsen and McKenna, 2003;
Sutton and Anderson, 1995).
In 1969, Willshaw and his colleagues (Willshaw et al., 1969) introduced the ‘‘nonholographic’’
associative memory. This ‘‘one-way’’ device (‘‘retrieval key’’ represented on one ‘‘ﬁeld’’ of neurons
and ‘‘retrieved pattern’’ on a second), based on Hebbian learning, is a major departure in concept
from the previous (linear algebra-based) associative memory concepts (Anderson, 1968, 1972;
Gabor, 1969; Kohonen, 1972). The brilliant Willshaw design (an absolutely essential step towards
the theory presented in this Appendix) is a generalization of the pioneering Steinbuch learnmatrix
(Steinbuch, 1961a,b, 1963, 1965; Steinbuch and Piske, 1963; Steinbuch and Widrow, 1965);
although Willshaw and his colleagues were not aware of this earlier development. For efﬁciency,
it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Willshaw network and its theory (Amari, 1989;
Kosko, 1988; Palm, 1980; Sommer and Palm, 1999). A related important idea is the ‘‘Brain State in
a Box’’ architecture of Anderson et al. (1977).
In 1987, I conceived a hybrid of the Willshaw network and the Amari or Hopﬁeld ‘‘energy
function’’ attractor network (Amari, 1974; Amit, 1989; Hopﬁeld, 1982, 1984). In effect, this hybrid
Figure 3.A.2
A single thalamocortical module; side view. The module consists of a full-depth patch of cortex
(possibly comprised of multiple separate full-depth disjoint sub-patches — not illustrated here); as well as a
paired zone of thalamus. The green and red neurons in cortical layer II, III or IV illustrate the two collections of
neurons representing two symbols of the module (common neurons shared by the two collections are not shown;
nor are the axons involved in the feature attractor neuronal network function used to implement confabulation). The
complete pool of neurons within the module used to represent symbols contains many tens, or even hundreds, of
thousands of neurons. Each symbol-representing neuron collection has tens to hundreds of neurons in it. Axons
from cortical layer VI to NRT (NRT) and thalamus are shown in dashed blue. Axons from thalamic glomeruli to NRT
and cortical layer IV are shown in dashed red. Axons from NRT neurons to glomeruli are shown in pink. An axon of
the operation command input, which affects a large subset of the neurons of the module, and which arrives from an
external subcortical nucleus, is shown in green. The theory only speciﬁes the overall information processing
function of each cortical module (implementation of the list of symbols, confabulation, and origination or termination
of knowledge links). Details of module operation at the cellular level are not known.

network was two reciprocally connected Willshaw networks; however, it also had an energy
function. Karen Haines and I theoretically investigated the dynamics of this network (Haines and
Hecht-Nielsen, 1988) [in 1988 computer exploration of the dynamics of such networks, at scales
sufﬁciently large to explore their utility for information processing, was not feasible]. We were able
to show theoretically that this hybrid had four important (and unique) characteristics. First, it
would, with very high probability, converge to one of the Willshaw stable states. Second, it would
converge in a ﬁnite number of steps. Third, there were no ‘‘spurious’’ stable states. Fourth, it could
carry out a ‘‘winner take all’’ kind of information processing. This hybrid network might thus serve
as the functional implementation of (in the parlance of this Appendix) a symbolic lexicon. This was
the ﬁrst result on the trail to the theory presented here. It took another 16 years to discover that, by
having antecedent support knowledge links deliver excitation to symbols (i.e., stable states) of such
a lexicon, this simple one-winner-take-all information processing operation (confabulation) is
sufﬁcient to carry out all of cognition.
By 1992 it had become possible to carry out computer simulations of reciprocal Willshaw
networks of interesting size. This immediately led to the rather startling discovery that, even
without an energy function (i.e., carrying out neuron updating on a completely local basis, as in
Willshaw’s original work), even signiﬁcantly ‘‘damaged’’ (the parlance at that stage of discovery)
starting states (Willshaw stable states with a signiﬁcant fraction of added and deleted neurons)
would almost always converge in one ‘‘round-trip’’ or ‘‘out-and-back cycle.’’ This made it likely
that this is the functional design of cortical lexicon circuits.
As this work progressed, it became clear that large networks of this type were even more robust
and would converge in one cycle even from a small incomplete fragment of a Willshaw stable state.
It was also at this point that the issue of ‘‘threshold control’’ (Willshaw’s original neurons all had
the same ﬁxed ‘‘ﬁring’’ threshold — equal to the number of neurons in each stable state) came to the
fore. If such networks were operated by a threshold control signal that rose monotonically from a
minimum level, it could automatically carry out a global ‘‘most excited neurons win’’ competition
without need for communication between the neurons. The subset of neurons which become active
ﬁrst then inhibit others from becoming so (at least in modules in the brain; but not in these simple
mathematical models, which typically lack inhibition). From this came the idea that each module
must be actively controlled by a graded command signal, much like an individual muscle. This
Figure 3.A.3
Simple attractor network example. The left, x, neural ﬁeld has N neurons; as does the right,
y, neural ﬁeld. One Willshaw stable state pair, xk and yk is shown here (actually, each xk and yk typically has
many tens of neurons — e.g., Np ¼ 60 for the parameter set described in the text — of which only 10 are shown
here). Each neuron of each state sends connections to all of the neurons of the other (only the connections
from one neuron in xk and one neuron in yk are shown here). Together, the set of all such connections for all L
stable pairs is recorded in the connection matrix W. Notice that these connections are not knowledge links — they
are internal connections between xk and yk — the two parts of the neuron population of symbol k within
a single module. Also, unlike knowledge link connections (which, as discussed in the next section, are unidirec-
tional and for which the second stage is typically very sparse), these interpopulation connections must be
reciprocal and dense (although they need not be 100% dense — a fact that you can easily establish experimentally
with your model).

eventually led to the realization that the control of movement and the control of thought are
implemented in essentially the same manner; using the same cortical and subcortical structures
(indeed, the theory postulates that there are many combined movement and thought processes
which are represented as unitized symbols at higher levels in the action hierarchy — e.g., a back
dive action routine in which visual perception must feed corrections to the movement control in
order to enter the water vertically).
To see what attractor networks of this unusual type are all about, the reader is invited to pause in
their reading and build (e.g., using C, LabVIEW, MATLAB, etc.) a simple working example using
the following prescription. If you accept this invitation, you will see ﬁrst-hand the amazing
capabilities of these networks (which will help you appreciate and accept the theory). While
simple, this network possesses many of the important behavioral characteristics of the hypothesized
design of biological feature attractor modules.
We will use two N-dimensional real column vectors, x and y, to represent the states of N
neurons in each of two ‘‘neural ﬁelds.’’ For good results, N should be at least 10,000 (even better
results are obtained for N above 30,000). Using a good random number generator, create L pairs
of x and y vectors {(x1,y1), (x2,y2), . . . , (xL,yL)} with each xi vector and each yi vector having
binary (0 and 1) entries selected independently at random; where the probability of each compon-
ent being 1 is p. Use, for example, p ¼ 0.003 and L ¼ 5,000 for N ¼ 20,000. As you will see,
these xi and yi pairs turn out to be stable states of the network. Each xk and yk vector pair, k ¼ 1,
2, . . . , L represents one of the L symbols of the network. For simplicity, we will concentrate
on the xk vector as the representation of symbol k. Thus, each symbol is represented
by a collection of about Np ‘‘active’’ neurons. The random selection of the symbol neuron sets
and the deliberate processes of neuronal interconnection between the sets correspond to the
development and reﬁnement processes in each thalamocortical module that are described later in
this section.
During development of the bipartite stable states {(x1,y1), (x2,y2), . . . , (xL,yL)} (which happens
gradually over time in biology, but all at once in this simple model), connections between the
neurons of the x and y ﬁelds are also established. These connections are very simple: each neuron of
xk (i.e., the neurons of the x ﬁeld whose indices within xk have a 1 assigned to them) sends a
connection to each neuron of yk and vice versa. This yields a connection matrix W given by
W ¼ U
X
N
i¼1
ykxT
k
 
!
(3A:1)
where the matrix function U sets every positive component of a matrix to 1 and every other
component to zero. Given these simple constructions, you are now ready to experiment with your
network.
First, choose one of the xk vectors and modify it. For example, eliminate a few neurons (by
converting entries that are 1 to 0s) or add a few neurons (by converting 0s to 1s). Let this modiﬁed
xk vector be called u. Now, ‘‘run’’ the network using u as the initial x ﬁeld state. To do this, ﬁrst
calculate the input excitation Ij of each y ﬁeld neuron j using the formula I ¼ Wu; where I is the
column vector containing the input excitation values Ij, j ¼ 1, 2, . . . , N. In effect, each active
neuron of the x ﬁeld (i.e., those neurons whose indices have a 1 entry in u) sends output to neurons
of the y ﬁeld to which it has connections (as determined by W). Each neuron j of the y ﬁeld sums up
the number of connections it has received from active x ﬁeld neurons (the ones designated by the 1
entries in u) and this is Ij.
After the Ij values have been calculated, those neurons of the y ﬁeld which have the largest Ij
values (or very close to the largest — say within 3 or 4 — this is a parameter you can experiment
with) are made active. As mentioned above, this procedure is a simple, but roughly equivalent,
surrogate for active global graded control of the network. Code the set of active y ﬁeld neurons
106
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

using the vector v (which has a 1 in the index of each active y ﬁeld neuron and zeros everywhere
else). Then calculate the input intensity vector WTv for the x ﬁeld (this is the ‘‘reverse transmis-
sion’’ phase of the operation of the network) and again make active those neurons with largest or
near-largest values of input intensity. This completes one cycle of operation of the network.
Astoundingly, the state of the x ﬁeld of the network will be very close to xk, the vector used as
the dominant base for the construction of u (as long as the number of modiﬁcations made to xk when
forming u was not too large).
Now expand your experiments by letting each u be equal to one of the x ﬁeld stable states
xk with many (say half) of its neurons made inactive plus the union of many (say, 1 to 10) small
fragments (say, 3 to 8 neurons each) of other stable x ﬁeld vectors, along with a small number
(say, 5 to 10) of active ‘‘noise’’ (randomly selected) neurons (see Figure 3.A.4). Now, when
operated, the network will converge rapidly (again, often in one cycle) to the xk symbol whose
fragment was the largest. When you do your experiments, you will see that this works even if that
largest fragment contains only a third of the neurons in the original xk. If u contains multiple stable
x ﬁeld vector fragments of roughly the same maximum size, the ﬁnal state is the union of the
complete x ﬁeld vectors (this is an important aspect of confabulation not mentioned in Hecht-
Nielsen, 2005). As we will see below, this network behavior is essentially all we need for carrying
out confabulation.
Again, notice that to achieve the ‘‘neurons with the largest or near-largest, input excitation win’’
information processing effect, all that is needed is to have an excitatory operation control input
to the network which uniformly raises all of the involved neurons’ excitation levels (towards a
constant ﬁxed ‘‘ﬁring’’ threshold that each neuron uses) at the same time. By ramping up this
input, eventually a group of neurons will ‘‘ﬁre’’; and these will be exactly those with the largest or
Figure 3.A.4
Feature attractor function of the simple attractor network example. The initial state (top portion) of
the x neural ﬁeld is a vector u consisting of a large portion (say, half of its neurons) of one particular xk (the neurons
of this xk are shown in green), along with small subsets of neurons of many other x ﬁeld stable states. The network
is then operated in the x to y direction (top diagram). Each neuron of u sends output to those neurons of the y ﬁeld
to which it is connected (as determined by the connection matrix W). The y ﬁeld neurons which receive the most, or
close to the most, connections from active neurons of u are then made active. These active neurons are
represented by the vector v. The network is then operated in the y to x direction (bottom diagram), where the
x ﬁeld neurons receiving the most, or close to the most, connections from active neurons of v are made active. The
astounding thing is that this set of active x ﬁeld neurons is typically very close to xk, the dominant component of
the initial u input. Yet, all of the processing is completely local and parallel. As will be seen below, this is all that is
needed to carry out confabulation. In thalamocortical modules this entire cycle of operation (which is controlled by a
rising operation command input supplied to all of the involved neurons of the module) is probably often completed in
roughly 100 msec. The hypothesis of the theory is that this feature attractor behavior implements confabulation —
the universal information processing operation of cognition.

near-largest input intensity. Localized mutual inhibition between cortical neurons (which is known
to exist, but is not included in the above simpliﬁed model) then sees to it that there are no additional
winners; even if the control input keeps rising. Note also that the rate of rise of the control signal
can control the width of the band of input excitations (below maximum) for which neurons are
allowed to win the competition: a fast rate allows more neurons (with slightly less input intensity
than the ﬁrst winners) to become active before inhibition has time to kick in. A slow rate of rise
restricts the winners to just one symbol. Finally, the operation control input to the network can be
limited to be less than some deliberately chosen maximum value: which will leave no symbols
active if the sum of the all neuron’s input excitation, plus the control signal, are below the ﬁxed
‘‘threshold’’ level. Thus, an attractor network confabulation can yield a null conclusion when there
are no sufﬁciently strong answers. Section 3.1 of the main chapter discusses some of these
information processing effects; which can be achieved by judicious control of a lexicon’s operation
command input signal.
An important difference between the behavior of this simple attractor network model and that of
thalamocortical modules is that, by involving inhibition (and some other design improvements such
as unifying the two neural ﬁelds into one), the biological attractor network can successfully deal
with situations where even hundreds of stable x ﬁeld vector fragments (as opposed to only a few in
the simple attractor network) can be suppressed to yield a fully expressed dominant fragment xk.
This remains an interesting area of research.
The development process of feature attractors is hypothesized by the theory to take place in
steps (which are usually completed in childhood; although under some conditions adults can
develop new feature attractor modules).
Each feature attractor module’s set of symbols is used to describe one attribute of objects in the
mental universe. Symbol development starts as soon as meaningful (i.e., not random) inputs to
the feature attractor start arriving. For ‘‘lower-level’’ attributes, this self-organization process
sometimes starts before birth. For ‘‘higher-level’’ attributes (modules), the necessary inputs do
not arrive (and lexicon organization does not start) until after the requisite lower-level modules
have organized and started producing assumed fact outputs.
The hypothesized process by which a feature attractor module is developed is now sketched. At
the beginning of development, a sizable subset of the neurons of cortical layers II, III, and IV of the
module happen by chance to preferentially receive extra-modular inputs and are stimulated
repeatedly by these inputs. These neurons develop, through various mutually competitive and
cooperative interactions, responses which collectively cover the range of signal ensembles the
region’s input channels are providing. In effect, each such feature detector neuron is simultaneously
driven to respond strongly to one of the input signal ensembles it happens to repeatedly receive;
while at the same time, through competition between feature detector neurons within the module, it
is discouraged from becoming tuned to the same ensemble of inputs as other feature detector
neurons of that module. This is the classic insight that arose originally in connection with the
mathematical concepts of vector quantization (VQ) and k-means. These competitive and coopera-
tive VQ feature set development ideas have been extensively studied in various forms by many
researchers from the 1960s through today (e.g., see Carpenter and Grossberg, 1991; Grossberg,
1976; Kohonen, 1984, 1995; Nilsson, 1965, 1998; Tsypkin, 1973; Zador, 1963). The net result of
this ﬁrst stage of feature attractor circuit development is a large set of feature detector neurons
(which, after this brief initial plastic period, become largely frozen in their responses — unless
severe trauma later in life causes recapitulation of this early development phase) that have
responses with moderate local redundancy and high input range coverage (i.e., low information
loss). These might be called the simple feature detector neurons.
Once the simple feature detector neurons of a module have been formed and frozen, additional
secondary (or ‘‘complex’’) feature detector neurons within the region then organize. These are
neurons which just happen (the wiring of cortex is locally random and is essentially formed ﬁrst,
during early organization and learning, and then is soon frozen for life) to receive most of their
108
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

input from simple feature detector neurons (as opposed to primarily from extra-modular inputs, as
with the simple feature detector neurons themselves).
In certain areas of cortex (e.g., primary visual cortex) secondary feature detector neurons can
receive inputs from primary feature detector neurons ‘‘belonging’’ to other nearby modules. This is
an example of why it is not correct to say that modules are disjoint and noninteracting (which
nonetheless is exactly how we will treat them here).
Just as with the primary neurons, the secondary feature detector neurons also self-organize along
the lines of a VQ codebook — except that this codebook sits to some degree ‘‘on top’’ of the simple
cell codebook. The net result is that secondary feature neurons tend to learn statistically common
combinations of multiple coexcited simple feature detector neurons, again, with only modest
redundancy and with little information loss.
A new key principle postulated by the theory relative to these populations of feature detector
neurons is that secondary (and tertiary — see below) feature detector neurons also develop
inhibitory connections (via growth of axons of properly interposed inhibitory interneurons that
receive input from the secondary feature detector neurons) that target the simple feature detector
neurons which feed them. Thus, when a secondary feature detector neuron becomes highly excited
(partly) by simple feature detector neuron inputs, it then immediately shuts off these simple
neurons. This is the theory’s precedence principle. In effect, it causes groups of inputs that are
statistically ‘‘coherent’’ to be re-represented as a whole ensemble; rather than as a collection of
‘‘unassembled’’ pieces. For example, in a visual input, an ensemble of simple feature detector
neurons together representing a straight line segment might be re-represented by some secondary
feature detector neurons which together represent the whole segment. Once activated by these
primary neurons, these secondary neurons then, by the precedence principle, immediately shut off
(via learned connections to local inhibitory interneurons) the primary neurons that caused their
activation.
Once the secondary feature detectors of a module have stabilized they too are then frozen and (at
least in certain areas of cortex) tertiary feature detectors (often coding even larger complexes of
statistically meaningful inputs) form their codebook. They too obey the precedence principle. For
example, in primary visual cortical regions, there are probably tertiary feature detectors which code
long line segments (probably both curved and straight) spanning multiple modules. Again, this is one
example of how nearby modules might interact — such tertiary feature detectors might well inhibit
and shut off lower-level feature detector neurons in other nearby modules. Of course, other inhibitory
interactions also develop — such as the line ‘‘end stopping’’ that inhibits reactions of line continu-
ation feature detectors beyond its end. In essence, the interactions within cortex during the short time
span of its reaction to external input (20 to 40 msec) are envisioned by this theory as similar to the
‘‘competitive and cooperative neural ﬁeld interactions’’ postulated by Stephen Grossberg and Gail
Carpenter and their colleagues in their visual processing theories (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1991;
Grossberg, 1976, 1987, 1997; Grossberg et al., 1997). When external input (along with an operate
command) is provided to a developed module, the above brief interactions ensue and then a
single symbol (or a small set of symbols, depending upon the manner in which the operate command
to the module is manipulated) representing that input is expressed. The process by which the symbols
are developed from the feature detector neuron responses is now brieﬂy discussed.
Once the feature detector neurons (of all orders) have had their responses frozen, the next step is
to consider the sets of feature detector neurons which become highly excited together across the
cortical region due to external inputs. Because the input wiring of the feature detector neurons is
random and sparse; the feature detector neurons function somewhat like VQ codebook vectors with
many of their components randomly zeroed out (i.e., like ordinary VQ codebook vectors projected
into randomly selected low-dimensional subspaces deﬁned by the relatively sparse random axonal
wiring feeding the feature detector neurons of the module). In general, under these circumstances, it
can be established that any input to the region (again, whether from thalamus, from other cortical
regions, or from other extracortical sources) will cause a roughly equal number of feature detector
Mechanization of Cognition
109

neurons to become highly excited. This is easy to see for an ordinary VQ codebook. Imagine a
probability density function in a high-dimensional input space (the raw input to the region).
The feature detector responses can be represented as points spread out in a roughly equiprobable
manner within this data cloud (at least before projection into their low-dimensional subspaces)
(Kohonen, 1995). Thus, given any speciﬁc input, we can choose to highly excite a roughly uniform
number of highest appropriate precedence feature detector vectors that are closest in angle to that
input vector.
In effect, if we imagine a rising externally supplied operation control signal (effectively
supplied to all of the feature detector neurons that have not been shut down by the precedence
principle), as the sum of the control signal and each neuron’s excitation level (due to the external
inputs) climbs, the most highly excited neurons will cross their ﬁxed ‘‘thresholds’’ ﬁrst and ‘‘ﬁre’’
(there are many more details than this, but this general idea is hypothesized to be correct). If the rate
of rise of the operate signal is constant, a roughly ﬁxed number of not-inhibited feature detector
neurons will begin ‘‘ﬁring’’ before local inhibition from these ‘‘early winners’’ prevents any more
winners from arising. This leaves a ﬁxed set of active neurons of roughly a ﬁxed size. The theory
presumes that such ﬁxed sets will, by means of their coactivity and the mutually excitatory
connections that develop between them, tend to become established and stabilized as the internal
feature attractor circuit connections gradually form and stabilize. Each such neuron group, as
adjusted and stabilized as an attractor state of the module over many such trials, becomes one of
the symbols in the lexicon.
Each ﬁnal symbol can be viewed as being a localized ‘‘cloud’’ in the VQ external input
representation space composed of a uniform number of close-by coactive feature detector
responses (imagine a VQ where there is not one winning vector, but many). Together, these
clouds cover the entire portion of the space in which the external inputs are seen. Portions of the
VQ space with higher input vector probability density values automatically have denser clouds.
Portions with lower density have more diffuse clouds. Yet, each cloud is represented by roughly the
same number of vectors (neurons). These clouds are the symbols. In effect, the symbols form a
Voronoi-like partitioning of the occupied portion of the external input representation space
(Kohonen, 1984, 1995); except that the symbol cloud partitions are not disjoint, but overlap
somewhat.
Information theorists have not spent much time considering the notion of having a cloud
of ‘‘winning vectors’’ (i.e., what this theory would term a symbol) as the outcome of the
operation of a vector quantizer. The idea has always been to only allow the single VQ codebook
vector that is closest to the ‘‘input’’ win. From a theoretical perspective, the reason clouds of
points are needed in the brain is that the connections which deﬁne the ‘‘input’’ to the module
(whether they be sensory inputs arriving via thalamus, knowledge links arriving from other portions
of cortex, or yet other inputs) only connect (randomly) to a sparse sampling of the feature vectors.
As mentioned above, this causes the feature detector neurons’ vectors to essentially lie in relatively
low-dimensional random subspaces of the VQ codebook space. Thus, to comprehensively charac-
terize the input (i.e., to avoid signiﬁcant information loss) a number of such ‘‘individually
incomplete,’’ but mutually complementary, feature representations are needed. So, only a cloud
will do. Of course, the beauty of a cloud is that this is exactly what the stable states of a feature
attractor neuronal module must be in order to achieve the necessary confabulation ‘‘winner-take-
all’’ dynamics.
A subtle point the theory makes is that the organization of a feature attractor module is
dependent upon which input data source is available ﬁrst. This ﬁrst-available source (whether
from sensory inputs supplied through thalamus or active symbol inputs from other modules) drives
development of the symbols. Once development has ﬁnished, the symbols are largely frozen
(although they sometimes can change later due to symbol disuse and new symbols can be added
in response to persistent changes in the input information environment). Since almost all aspects of
cognition are hierarchical, once a module is frozen, other modules begin using its assumed fact
110
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

outputs to drive their development. So, in general, development is a one-shot process (which
illustrates the importance of getting it right the ﬁrst time in childhood). Once the symbols have
been frozen, the only synaptic modiﬁcations which occur are those connected with knowledge
acquisition, which is the topic discussed next.
3.A.4
Implementation of Knowledge
As discussed in Hecht-Nielsen (2005), all of the knowledge used in cognition (e.g., for vision,
hearing, somatosensation, language, thinking, and moving) takes the form of unidirectional
weighted links between pairs of symbols (typically, but not necessarily, symbols residing within
different modules). This section sketches how these links are implemented in human cortex (all
knowledge links used in human cognition reside entirely within the white matter of cortex).
Figure 3.A.5 considers a single knowledge link from symbol c in a particular cortical source
module (lexicon) to symbol l in a particular target or answer lexicon. The set of all knowledge
links from symbols of one particular source lexicon to symbols of one particular target lexicon are
called a knowledge base. The single knowledge link considered in Figure 3.A.5 belongs to the
knowledge base linking the particular source lexicon shown to the particular target lexicon shown.
When the neurons of Figure 3.A.5 representing symbol c are active (or highly excited if
multiple symbols are being expressed, but this case will be ignored here), these c neurons send
their action potential outputs to millions of neurons residing in cortical regions to which the neurons
of this source region send axons (the gross statistics of this axon distribution pattern are determined
genetically, but the local details are random). Each such active symbol-representing neuron sends
action potential signals via its axon collaterals to tens of thousands of neurons. Of the millions of
neurons which receive these signals from the c neurons, a few thousand receive not just one such
axon collateral, but many. These are termed transponder neurons. They are strongly excited by this
simultaneous input from the c neurons; causing them to send strong output to all of the neurons
to which they in turn send axons. In effect, the ﬁrst step of the link transmission starts with the
tens to hundreds of active neurons representing symbol c and ends with many thousands of excited
transponder neurons, which also (collectively) uniquely represent the symbol c. In effect, tran-
sponder neurons momentarily amplify the size of the c symbol representation. It is hypothesized by
the theory that this synﬁre chain (Abeles, 1991) of activation does not propagate further because

only active (or highly excited) neurons can launch such a process and while the transponder neurons
are excited, they are not active or highly excited (i.e., active, or highly excited, neurons — a rare
state that can only exist following a confabulation information processing operation — are the only
ones that can unconditionally excite other neurons) However, as with transponder neurons, if
a neuron receives a high-enough number of simultaneous inputs from active neurons — even
through unstrengthened synapses, and in the absence of any operation command input — it will
become excited. Finally, excited neurons can excite other neurons if those other neurons reside in
a lexicon which is simultaneously also receiving operation command signal input (this is what
happens when knowledge is used and when short-term memory learning takes place, as will be
discussed below).
The wiring of the symbol and transponder neuron axons is (largely) completed in childhood and
then remains (at least for our purposes here) essentially ﬁxed for life. Again, the gross statistics of
this wiring are genetically determined; but the local details are random.
A relatively small number (say, 1 to 25% — a genetically controlled percentage that deliberately
varies across cortex) of the target region neurons representing symbol l will just happen to each
receive many synaptic inputs from a subset of the transponder neurons (Figure 3.A.5 illustrates the
axonal connections from c transponder neurons for only one of these few l neurons). These
particular l neurons complete the knowledge link. If all of the neurons representing symbol l are
already active at the moment these synaptic inputs arrive, then (in the event that they have not been
previously permanently strengthened) the transponder neuron synapses that land on this subset of
them will be temporarily strengthened (this is called short-term memory). During the next sleep
period, if this causal pairing of symbols c and l is again deliberately rehearsed, these temporarily
strengthened synapses may be more lastingly strengthened (this is medium-term memory). If this
link is subsequently rehearsed more over the next few days, these synapses may be permanently
strengthened (this is long-term memory). It is important to note that the synapses from the c neurons
to the c transponder neurons are generally not strengthened. This is because the transponder
neurons are not meaningfully active at the time when these inputs arrive. Only deliberate usage
of a link with immediately prior co-occurrence of both source symbol and target symbol
activity causes learning. This was, roughly, the learning hypothesis that Donald Hebb advanced 56
years ago (Hebb, 1949).
Note again that the transponder neurons that represent a symbol c will always be the same;
independent of which target lexicon(s) are to be linked to. Thus, c transponder neurons must send
a sufﬁciently large number of axons to all of the lexicons containing symbols to which symbol c
might need to connect. The theory posits that genetic control of the distribution of axons (nomin-
ally) ensures that all of the potentially necessary knowledge links can be formed. Obviously, this
postulated design could be analyzed, since the rough anatomy and statistics of cortical axon
fascicles are known. Such an analysis might well be able to support, or raise doubts, that this
hypothesis is capable of explaining cortical knowledge.
Cognitive functions where confabulations always yield zero or one winners, because at most one
symbol has anything close to enough knowledge links from the assumed facts, do not need precisely
weighted knowledge links. In cortical modules which only require such confabulations, knowledge
links terminating within that module are hypothesized by the theory to be essentially binary in
strength: either completely unstrengthened (i.e., as yet unused) or strong (strengthened to near
maximum). Such modules together probably encompass a majority of cortex.
However, other cognitive functions (e.g., language) do require each knowledge link to have a
strength that is directly related by some ﬁxed function to p(cjl). The theory’s hypothesis as to how
these weightings arise is now sketched.
Although the mechanisms of synaptic modiﬁcation are not yet well understood (particularly
those connected with medium-term and long-term memory), research has established that ‘‘Heb-
bian’’ synaptic strengthening does occur (Cowan et al., 2001). This presumably can yield a
transponder neuron to target symbol neuron synapse strength directly related to the joint probability
112
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

p(cl) (i.e., roughly, the probability of the two involved symbols being coactive). In addition,
studies of postsynaptic neurotransmitter depolarization transduction response (i.e., within the
neuron receiving the synaptic neurotransmitter output; separate from the transmitting synapse
itself) by Marder and her colleagues (Marder and Prinz, 2002, 2003) and by Turrigiano and her
colleagues (Desai et al., 2002; Turrigiano and Nelson, 2000, 2004; Turrigiano et al., 1998) suggest
that the postsynaptic apparatus of an excitatory cortical synapse (e.g., one landing on a target
symbol neuron) is independently modiﬁable in efﬁcacy, in multiplicative series with this Hebbian
p(cl) efﬁcacy. This ‘‘post-synaptic signaling efﬁcacy’’ is expressed as a neurotransmitter recep-
tivity proportional to a direct function of the reciprocal of that target neuron’s average ﬁring rate,
which is essentially 1/p(l). The net result is implementation by this Hebb/Marder/Turrigiano
learning process (as I call it) of an overall link strength directly related to p(cl)/p(l), which by
Bayes law is p(cjl). Thus, it is plausible that biological learning processes at the neuron level can
accumulate the knowledge needed for confabulation.
3.A.5
Implementation of Confabulation
Since only a small subset of the neurons representing target lexicon symbol l are excited by
a knowledge link from source lexicon symbol c, how can confabulation be implemented?
This section, which presents the theory’s hypothesized implementation of confabulation,
answers this question and shows that these ‘‘internally sparse’’ knowledge links are an essential
element of cortical design. Counterintuitively, if these links were ‘‘fully connected,’’ cortex could
not function.
Figure 3.A.6 schematically illustrates how confabulation is implemented in a thalamocortical
(answer lexicon) module. The four boxes on the left are four cortical lexicons, each having exactly
one assumed fact symbol active (symbols a, b, g, and d respectively). Each of these active symbols
is represented by the full complement of the neurons which represent it, which are all active
(illustrated as a complete row of ﬁlled circles within that assumed fact symbol’s lexicon module,
depicted in the ﬁgure in colors green, red, blue, and brown for a, b, g, and d, respectively). As will
be seen below, this is how the symbol(s), which are the conclusions of a confabulation operation are
biologically expressed (namely, all of their representing neurons are active and all other symbol
representing neurons are inactive).
In Figure 3.A.6 the neurons representing each symbol of a module are shown as separated
into their own rows. Of course, in the actual tissue, the neurons of each symbol are scattered
randomly within the relevant layers of the cortical portion of the module implementing the
lexicon. But for clarity, in Figure 3.A.6 each symbol’s neurons are shown collected together
into one row. The fact that the same neuron appears in multiple rows (each symbol-representing
neuron typically participates in representing many different symbols) is ignored here, as this small
pairwise overlap between symbol representations causes no signiﬁcant interference between
symbols.
(Note: This is easy to see: consider the simpliﬁed attractor you built and experimented
with above. It always converged to a single pure state xk (at least when the initial state u was
dominated by xk); meaning that all of the neurons which represent xk are active and all other
neurons are inactive. However, each of the neurons of xk also belongs to many other stable states xi,
but this does not cause any problems or interference. You may not have seen this aspect of the
system at the time you did your experiments — go check! You will ﬁnd that even though the
overlap between each pair of x ﬁeld stable states is relatively small, each individual neuron
participates in many such stable states. The properties of this kind of attractor network are quite
astounding; and they do not even have many of the additional design features that thalamocortical
modules possess.)
The answer lexicon for the elementary confabulation we are going to carry out (based upon
assumed facts a, b, g, and d, just as described in Hecht-Nielsen, 2005) is shown as the box on
Mechanization of Cognition
113

the right in Figure 3.A.6. Each assumed fact symbol has knowledge links to multiple symbols
of the answer lexicon; as illustrated by the colored arrows proceeding from each source lexicon
to the answer lexicon. The width of each such knowledge link arrow corresponds to the link
strength; i.e., the value of its p(cjl) probability. Each assumed fact symbol in this example is
assumed to be the sole conclusion of a previous confabulation on its lexicon. Thus, symbols a, b, g,
and d are all active (maximally transmissive).
The symbols of the answer lexicon which receive one or more links from the assumed facts are
denoted by e, l1, l2, l3, and so forth, and for clarity, are grouped in Figure 3.A.6. As discussed in
the previous section, the actual percentage of neurons of each target symbol which receive synaptic
inputs from the assumed fact’s transponder neurons is approximately the same for all symbols (this
is a function of the roughly uniform — at least for each individual answer lexicon — binomial
connection statistics of the locally random cortico-cortical axons implementing each knowledge
link). And as mentioned earlier, this percentage is low (from 1 to 25%, depending on where the
module is located in cortex).
As shown in Figure 3.A.6, symbol l1 receives only one link (it is a medium-strength link from
assumed fact symbol a). In accordance with Figure 3.A.5, only a fraction of the neurons of the
answer lexicon which represent symbol l1, are actually being excited by this input link. These are
shown as green ﬁlled circles with a above them (again, for clarity, the target symbol neurons which
happen to receive input excitation from a particular assumed fact, which are actually randomly
located, are grouped together in the ﬁgure, and labeled above with the symbol of that assumed fact).
Note that, in the case of this group of green neurons of symbol l1 receiving input from assumed fact
symbol a, that a medium-sized font a is shown above the group; reﬂecting the fact that the
knowledge link delivering this assumed fact excitation only has medium strength p(l1ja). Simi-
larly, the neurons representing symbol l2 are also receiving only one medium-strength link; namely
from assumed fact symbol g.

Only two of the answer lexicon symbols shown in Figure 3.A.6, namely e and lL are receiving
links from all four assumed facts. However, note that the links impinging on the neurons of symbol
e are stronger than those impinging on symbol lL. Now this discussion of the biological imple-
mentation of confabulation will pause momentarily for a discussion of synapses.
Despite over a century of study, synapse function is still only poorly understood. What is now
clear is that synapses have dynamic behavior, both in terms of their responses to incoming action
potentials, and in terms of modiﬁcations to their transmission efﬁcacy (over a wide range of time
scales). For example, some synapses seem to have transmission efﬁcacy which ‘‘droops’’ or
‘‘fades’’ on successive action potentials in a rapid sequence (such are sometimes termed depressing
synapses — which has nothing to do with the clinical condition of depression). Other synapses
(termed facilitating) increase their efﬁcacies over such a sequence; and yet, others exhibit no
change. However, it has been learned that even these categorizations are too simplistic and do not
convey a true picture of what is going on. That clear picture awaits a day when the actual
modulations used for information transmission, and the ‘‘zoo’’ of functionally distinct neurons
and synapses, are better understood. Perhaps this theory can speed the advent of that day by
providing a comprehensive vision of overall cortical function, which can serve as a framework
for formulating scientiﬁc questions.
Even though little is known about synapses, it is clear that many synapses are weak (unstrength-
ened), quite likely unreliable, and marginally capable of signaling (this theory claims that roughly
99% of synapses must be in this category, see Section 3.A.7). This is why it takes a pool of
highly excited or active neurons representing a symbol (such neurons possess the ultimate in
neural signaling power) to excite transponder neurons (each of which receives many inputs from
the pool). No lesser neural collection is capable of doing this through unstrengthened synapses
(which is why cortical synﬁre chains have only two stages). However, it is also known that
some synapses (this theory claims that these represent fewer than 1% of the total of cortical
excitatory synapses, see Section 3.A.7) are much stronger. These stronger synapses (which
the theory claims are the seat of storage of all cortical knowledge) are physically larger
than unstrengthened synapses and are often chained together into multiple-synapse groups that
operate together (see Figure 3.A.7). One estimate (Henry Markram, personal communication) is
that such a strengthened synapse group can be perhaps 60 times stronger than the common
unstrengthened synapse (in terms of the total depolarizing effect of the multi-synapse on the
target cell at which they squirt glutamate neurotransmitter). These strong synapses are probably
also much more reliable. Figure 3.A.7 illustrates these two hypothesized types of cortical excitatory
synapses.
The theory hypothesizes that synapses which implement knowledge links (as in Figure 3.A.5)
are always strengthened greatly in comparison with unstrengthened synapses. When the knowledge
link requires that a transponder–neuron-to-target–symbol–neuron synapse code the graded prob-
ability p(cjl) (as opposed to just a binary ‘‘unstrengthened’’ or ‘‘strong’’), the dynamic range of
such a strengthened synapse is probably no more than a factor of, say, 6. In other words, if the
weakest strengthened synapse has an ‘‘efﬁcacy’’ 10 times that of an unstrengthened synapse,
the strongest possible synapse will have an efﬁcacy of 60. Thus, we must code the smallest
meaningful p(cjl) value as 10 and the strongest as 60.
In our computer confabulation experiments (e.g., those reported in Hecht-Nielsen, 2005
and many others), the smallest meaningful p(cjl) value (deﬁne this to be a new constant
p0) turns out to be about p0 ¼ 0.0001 and the largest p(cjl) value seen is almost 1.0. As it
turns out, the smaller p(cjl) values need the most representational precision; whereas little
error is introduced if the larger p(cjl)’s are more coarsely represented. Clearly, this is a situation
that seems ripe for using logarithms! The theory indeed proposes that nonbinary strengthened
synapses in human cortex have their p(cjl) probabilities coded using a logarithmic scale (i.e., y ¼
logb(cx) ¼ a þ logb(x), where a ¼ logb(c)). This not only solves the limited synaptic dynamic
Mechanization of Cognition
115

range problem mentioned above, but it is also a key part of making confabulation work (as we
will see below)!
So, given the above estimates and hypothesis, let us determine the base b of the logarithms used
for synaptic knowledge coding in the human cerebral cortex, as well as the constant c (actually,
we will instead estimate a ¼ logb(c)). We want p(cjl) ¼ 0.0001 to be represented by a synaptic
strength of 10; and we want p(cjl) ¼ 1.0 to be represented by a synaptic strength of 60. In other
words, we need to ﬁnd positive constants a and b such that:
a þ logb (0:0001) ¼ 10
(3A:2)
and
a þ logb (1:0) ¼ 60
(3A:3)
Clearly, from the second equation, a ¼ 60 (since the log of 1 is zero for every b). Then the ﬁrst
equation yields b ¼ 1.2023. Thus, when a highly excited transponder neuron representing source
symbol c delivers its signal to a neuron of answer lexicon symbol l, the signal delivered to that
neuron will be proportional to a þ logb(p(cjl)) (where the constant of proportionality is postulated
to be the same for all target neurons of a single module; and where nearby modules typically have
very similar proportionality constants).
You might wonder why the signal delivered is not the ‘‘product’’ of the transponder neuron
output signal and the synaptic efﬁcacy (as was common in classical ‘‘neural network’’ models such
as the Perceptron [Hecht-Nielsen, 2004]). Well, it is! However, exploring this aspect of the theory
would quickly take us beyond the scope of this introductory sketch. Since transponder neurons

Synapse strengthening — the fundamental storage mechanism of cortical knowledge links. Sub-
ﬁgure A illustrates a weak, unreliable, unstrengthened synapse making a connection from a transponder neuron
axon to a target neuron dendrite. The theory hypothesizes that roughly 99% of human cortical synapses with this
connectivity are unstrengthened. Subﬁgure B illustrates the same synapse after learning (i.e., the progression from
short-term memory to medium-term memory to long-term memory has been completed). Now, the synapse has
blossomed into three parallel synapses, each physically much larger than the original one. This multi-synapse
(perhaps what has been recently termed a ribbon synapse) is more reliable and has an efﬁcacy ranging from
perhaps 10 to 60 times that of the original unstrengthened synapse (learning always yields a great increase
in efﬁcacy — the theory posits that there are no such knowledge storage synapses which are only slightly
strengthened).
116

coding a single active symbol (assumed fact) on a lexicon, essentially anywhere in cortex, always
ﬁre at about the same signal level (namely, the maximum possible) when they are implementing a
link, we can consider this link input signal as constant. Thus, for the purposes of discussing
elementary confabulation (the process of reaching conclusions based upon sets of assumed facts),
we need not worry about this issue here. Another issue that can be ignored is the inﬂuence of the
many nonstrengthened synapses impinging on target lexicon symbol neurons. This effect can be
ignored because the inputs due to this proliﬁc, but unreliable, source is very uniformly distributed
across all neurons of all symbols and so it affects them all equally. In other words, this input acts as
a low-variance, roughly constant, uniform ‘‘background noise.’’
The main conclusion of the above argument is that those neurons which represent answer
lexicon symbol l, which happen to receive a sufﬁcient number of c transponder neuron inputs to
allow them to respond, will all have about the same response to that input; namely a response
proportional to a þ logb(p(cjl)).
Recall from the discussion of Figure 3.A.6 that the number of neurons of each answer lexicon
symbol which receive sufﬁcient synaptic inputs from the transponder neurons of a source symbol c
are about the same for each knowledge link and each symbol. You may wonder why only l neurons
having this maximum number of synapses from c transponders will respond. It has to do with the
events of the confabulation process. As the operate command input rises, these ‘‘sufﬁcient’’ neurons
will become active ﬁrst. In the operation of the feature attractor (which is very fast) only those
neurons with a sufﬁcient number of inputs from an assumed fact will be able to participate in the
dynamical convergence process. Another good question is why the variance in this number of
synapses turns out to be small. This is because the binomial statistics of random transponder neuron
axons make it such that neurons with unusually large numbers of synapses are extremely unlikely.
Otherwise put, binomial (or Poisson) probability distributions have ‘‘thin tails.’’ Thus, the set of all
l neurons which have strengthened synapses — the ones which participate in the (strength-
weighted) excitation of l — are those that lie in a narrow range at the top end of the Poisson
density right before it plummets.
The binomial statistics of the locally random cortical connections also keep the number of target
symbol neurons with near-maximum complements of input synapses very close to being constant
for all symbols. Let this number of neurons be K. Then the total excitation of the K neurons which
represent answer lexicon symbol l that are receiving input from c symbol transponders (where c is
one of the assumed facts) is proportional to K[a þ logb(p(cjl)] (again, with a universal constant of
proportionality that is the same for all the symbols of one module).
Finally, since the subsets of l-representing neurons which receive inputs from different links
typically do not overlap, the total excitation of the entire set of neurons representing answer lexicon
symbol l (assuming that l is receiving knowledge link inputs from assumed facts a, b, g, and d) is
approximately proportional to (again, with a universal constant of proportionality) the total input
excitation sum I(l):
I(l)  K  [a þ logb (p(ajl))] þ K  [a þ logb (p(bjl))]
þ K  [a þ logb (p(gjl))] þ K  [a þ logb (p(djl))]
¼ 4K  a þ K  logb [p(ajl)  p(bjl)  p(gjl)  p(djl)]
(3A:4)
Recall from the discussion of Section 3.A.2, that when the answer lexicon feature attractor is
operated (and yields only one winning symbol), all of the neurons representing the winning symbol
(which will be the one with the highest total input excitation) are left in the active state and all other
symbol neurons are left inactive. By virtue of the above formula, we see that this winning symbol
will be the symbol l with the highest confabulation product p(ajl)  p(bjl)  p(gjl)  p(djl) value
(e.g., in the speciﬁc case of Figure 3.A.6, this will be symbol e). This is the theory’s explanation for
how thalamocortical modules can carry out confabulation.
Mechanization of Cognition
117

Since not all symbols of the answer lexicon of Figure 3.A.6 receive knowledge links from all
four assumed facts a, b, g, and d, what will be the input excitation sums on symbols that receive
fewer than four link inputs (total excitation level of the entire ensemble of neurons representing that
symbol in the answer module)? For example, consider an answer lexicon symbol u which only
receives links from assumed facts b and d. The total input excitation sum I(u) of the set of neurons
which represent u will be:
I(u)  K  [a þ logb (p(bju))] þ K  [a þ logb (p(dju))]
¼ 2K  a þ K  logb [p(bju)  p(dju)]
(3A:5)
Thus, given that each individual term in the ﬁrst lines of Equations (3A.4) and (3A.5) lies between
K  10 and K  60, the value of I(u) (Equation (3A.5)) could, in extreme cases, be larger than that of
I(l) of Equation (3A.4) (although in most cases I(u) will be smaller and u will not be the winning
symbol). In any event, the symbol with the highest I value will win the confabulation.
Note that in cognitive functions which employ binary knowledge (every knowledge link
transponder neuron synapse is either unstrengthened or is ‘‘strong’’), I(l) is roughly proportional
to the number of links that symbol l receives. Thus, in these cortical areas, confabulation devolves
into simply choosing the symbol with the most knowledge link inputs. Although it is not discussed
in this chapter, this is exactly what such cognitive functions demand.
The seeming problem identiﬁed above of having symbols which are missing one or more
knowledge links win the confabulation competition is not actually a problem at all. Sometimes
(e.g., in early visual processing) this is exactly what we want, and at other times, when we want to
absolutely avoid this possibility, we can simply carry out multiple confabulations in succession
to form a sequence of expectations. Also, some portions of cortex probably have smaller dynamic
ranges (e.g., 40 to 60 instead of 10 to 60) for strengthened synapses, which also helps solve this
potential problem.
As discussed in Section 3.1 of the main chapter, in mechanizing cognition we explicitly address
this issue by appropriately deﬁning a constant called the bandgap (related to quantity above).
In summary, the theory claims that the above-sketched biological implementation of confabu-
lation meets all information processing requirements of all aspects of cognition; yet, it is blazingly
fast and can be accurately and reliably carried out with relatively simple components (neurons and
synapses) which operate independently in parallel. Confabulation is my candidate for the greatest
evolutionary discovery of all time (with strong runners-up being DNA and photosynthesis).
3.A.6
Action Commands
At the end of a confabulation operation, there is often a single symbol active. For example, the
triangular red cortical neurons (belonging to Layers II, III, and IV) shown in Figure 3.A.2 represent
one particular symbol of the module which is now active following a confabulation. Of course, in
a real human thalamocortical module, such an active symbol would be represented by tens to
hundreds (depending on the location of the module in cortex) of ‘‘red’’ neurons, not the few shown
in the ﬁgure.
A key principle of the theory is that at the moment a single symbol of a module achieves the
active state at the end of a confabulation operation, a speciﬁc set of neurons in Layer V of the
cortical portion of that module (or of a nearby module — this possibility will be ignored here)
become highly excited. The outputs of these cortical Layer V neurons (shown in brown in Figure
3.A.2) leave cortex and proceed immediately to subcortical action nuclei (of which there are many,
with many different functions). This is the theory’s conclusion–action principle. In effect, every
time cognition reaches a deﬁnitive single conclusion, a behavior is launched. This is what keeps us
moving, thinking, and doing, every moment we are awake.
118
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

The Layer V neurons which become highly excited when a symbol wins a confabulation cause a
very speciﬁc set of actions to be executed (or at least to be considered for execution; depending on
the function of the action nucleus that receives the Layer V efferents). This is the origin of all
behavior — each successful (one winning symbol) confabulation causes the launch of a set of
associated action commands. These actions can be part of a movement process, part of a thought
process, or both.
During development, the genetically determined program for creating the brain is, barring
problems, executed. This program causes the development of axons from neurons in Layer V of
each cortical module portion which proceed to genetically directed subcortical action nuclei (of
which there are tens). In other words, genetics can ensure that a module has the Layer V neurons it
needs to launch those actions, which that particular module should be empowered to execute. Thus,
each of us has a range of behavioral potentialities which are in this sense predetermined. Undoubt-
edly, this is how various talents and personality traits are transferred from parents to children. This
is part of the ‘‘nature’’ portion of the human equation.
Given the behavioral potentialities established by the genetically directed wiring of the axons of
the Layer V neurons of a module to action nuclei, the big question is how exactly the correct ones of
these Layer V neurons end up getting ‘‘wired’’ from the population of neurons representing each
symbol. Given the exact speciﬁcity of effect each Layer V neuron produces, there is no room for
error in this wiring from each symbol to the action commands it should launch. Since the local
geometrical arrangement of the symbol-representing neurons and action command neurons within
their respective layers is random, and their local axonal wiring is largely random, this wiring from
symbol representing neurons to Layer V action-command-generating neurons cannot be genetically
determined. These associations must be learned and they must be perfect. Figure 3.A.8
illustrates the theory’s hypothesized mechanism for implementing these precise symbol to action
associations. This ﬁgure will be referred to extensively below.
The learning of symbol to action command associations is almost certainly a totally different
learning process from that used in development of module symbol sets or in the establishment of
knowledge links. This symbol to action association learning process is hypothesized to take place
extensively during childhood; but also very frequently during adulthood. Cognitive lexicon devel-
opment, cognitive knowledge acquisition, and symbol to action command association learning
together make up the most ‘‘glamorous’’ parts of the ‘‘nurture’’ portion of the human equation (there
are a number of other, quite different, learning processes that go on in other parts of the brain; e.g.,
learning to sense when we should use the toilet).
Notice that in Figure 3.A.2, every cortical layer of a module is mentioned except Layer I (the
most superﬁcial). Layers II, III, and IV are primarily involved in symbol representation, precedence
principle interactions among feature detector neurons, and the receipt of afferents from thalamus.
Layer V is where the action command output neurons reside. And Layer VI is where the cortical
efferents to thalamus arise. The theory hypothesizes that Layer I is where the wiring between the
symbol representation neuron sets and the Layer V action command output neurons takes place
(and quite possibly some of the wiring for the feature attractor module function as well). It is well
known (Paxinos and Mai, 2004) that the neurons of Layer V (typically these are of the pyramidal
category) have apical dendrites that ascend to Layer I and then branch profusely. Further, neurons
of Layers II, III, and IV typically send large numbers of axon collaterals to Layer I (and also
frequently have apical dendrites too — but these will not be discussed here). Further, the basal
ganglia (BG — a complicated set of brain nuclei known to be involved in multiple types of action
learning (Paxinos and Mai, 2004)), speciﬁcally, the BG substructure known as the striatum sends
signals in great profusion to Layer I of cortex via the thalamus (see Figure 3.A.8). This radiation is
principally concentrated in frontal cortex (where most behaviors seem to originate), but other
cortical areas also receive some of these inputs.
Given the random nature of cortical wiring, the only way to establish correct symbol to action
associations is via experimentation. This experimentation is carried out (starting with the simplest
Mechanization of Cognition
119

actions and then constructing an action hierarchy). At beginning of development of each module,
the ﬁrst item on the agenda is development of the module’s symbols (which was discussed in
Section 3.A.3). As this lexicon development process begins to produce stable symbols, the problem
of associating these with actions is addressed.
At ﬁrst, action command neurons are randomly triggered when a particular single symbol is
being expressed by the lexicon (i.e., that symbol was the lone outcome of a confabulation operation
by the module). As this occurs, the BG monitors the activity of this lexicon (via efferents from
Layers III and V — see Figure 3.A.8). When a randomly activated action command happens to
cause an action that the basal ganglia judge to be particularly ‘‘good’’ (meaning that a reduction in a
drive or goal level was observed — which the basal ganglia know about because of their massive
input from the limbic system), that action is then associated with the currently expressed symbol via
the mechanism of Figure 3.A.8.
(Note: Reductions in drive and goal states are almost never immediate following an action. They
are usually delayed by seconds or minutes; sometimes by hours. One of the hypothesized functions
of the BG [Miyamoto et al., 2004] is that it develops a large number of predictive models, called
critics [Barto et al., 1983], that learn [via delayed reinforcement learning methods; Sutton and
Barto, 1998] to accurately predict the eventual goal-or-drive-state-reduction ‘‘value’’ or ‘‘worth’’ of
an action at the time the action is suggested or executed. It is by using such critic models that the BG
is hypothesized by the theory to immediately assess the worth of action commands produced by
Layer V outputs.)
When an action command that is randomly launched is indeed judged worthy of association
from the currently expressed symbol of a module, a special signal (the green arrow in Figure 3.A.8)
is sent (via thalamus) from the striatum of the BG to cortical Layer I of the module. This green
signal causes the synapses (blue circles) connecting axon collaterals of the neurons representing the
Figure 3.A.8
Learning and using the precise associations from symbols to action commands within a single
cortical module. Keep in mind that the neuron populations involved in these associations, illustrated here as small
sets, are, in the brain, extremely large sets (tens of thousands of neurons in every case). See text for explanation of
the ﬁgure.
120

currently expressed symbol (these neurons are shown in red in Figure 3.A.8, and reside in Layer II,
III, or IV [I am not sure]) with the apical dendrites of the now-validated action command neurons
of Layer V (shown in brown in Figure 3.A.8) to be incrementally strengthened. Essentially every
neuron representing the expressed symbol gets its direct synaptic connections with the action
command neurons incrementally strengthened.
Notice how different the situation of Figure 3.A.8 is from that of knowledge links. In a
knowledge link, the source symbol must ﬁrst amplify its signal by brieﬂy recruiting thousands
of transponder neurons to retransmit it. Even then, when the knowledge link signals arrive at
the target lexicon module, only a relatively small fraction of each target symbol’s neurons receive
a sufﬁcient number of inputs to complete the link. In Figure 3.A.8, we presume that almost all
of the expressed symbol’s representing neurons synapse directly with the apical dendrites of
each Layer V action command neuron. The reason that this is a sensible hypothesis is that Layer
I is well known to be fed extensively with axons from the neurons below it (i.e., neurons of the
module that represent symbols), and to be profusely supplied with dense apical dendrites from
Layer V neurons.
The synapses from symbol representing neurons to action command neurons are hypothesized
to be quite different from those used in knowledge links. In particular, these synapses can slowly
and gradually get stronger (if repeatedly strengthened over many trials over time), and can
slowly and gradually get weaker (if not strengthened very often, or not at all, over time). This is
why ‘‘skill knowledge’’ decays so fast (in comparison with cognitive knowledge, which lasts for
very long periods of time, even if not used). A major beneﬁt of this dynamic synapse characteristic
is that occasionally erroneous strengthening of synapses (e.g., when a random action command set
includes some irrelevant commands along with some effective ones) will, in general, not cause
problems (as long as the vast majority of strengthenings are warranted). This is very different from
cognition, where correction of erroneous knowledge is often impossible (and then the only solution
is to speciﬁcally learn not to use the erroneous knowledge).
The universal truism that ‘‘practice makes perfect’’ is thus exactly correct when it comes to
behavior. And for a difﬁcult skill (e.g., landing a jet ﬁghter on an aircraft carrier at night) to be
usable; that practice must have been recent. The associations from symbols to action command sets
are constantly being reshaped during life. If we live in a highly stable information environment we
might not notice much change in our behavioral repertoire over many years. If we are subjected to a
frequently and radically changing information environment, our behavior patterns are constantly
changing. In some respects, people who undergo such changes are being constantly ‘‘behaviorally
remade.’’ The workings of the neuronal network of Figure 3.A.8 are now brieﬂy discussed.
Clearly, the size of the set of speciﬁc Layer V action command neurons which need to be
triggered by the expression of a particular symbol is arbitrary. One symbol’s association might
involve activating a set of ﬁve speciﬁc Layer V neurons, another might involve activating 79, and
yet another might activate no Layer V neurons. Keep in mind that each individual neuron in the
population of tens to hundreds of neurons which together represent one particular symbol in a
lexicon also participates in many other such representations for other symbols. So, this association
must be between the population representing a symbol and a speciﬁc set of Layer V neurons.
This requirement suggests a unidirectional Willshaw-type associative network structure
wherein the ‘‘retrieval keys’’ all have almost exactly the same number of neurons (which is exactly
what the symbol representation neuron sets are like); but where the ‘‘output’’ neurons activated by
each key have an arbitrary number of neurons. This is exactly what a Willshaw structure can do —
the retrieval keys (‘‘stable states’’) xk MUST be random and MUST each have almost the same
number of neurons; but there can be as many or as few ‘‘output neurons’’ in the associated yk as
desired, with no restriction; and the individual neurons making up each xk population can appear in
many other such populations.
(Note: If you don’t see this, consider again the computer experiments you performed in
Section 3.A.3. You will see that it does not matter how many yk neurons there are for each xk, as
Mechanization of Cognition
121

long as we are not implementing the second, y ﬁeld to x ﬁeld, part of the cycle (this is not well
known, because for analytical simplicity, the original Willshaw model used the same number of
neurons in both the xk and xk vectors). Further, as long as the xk keys are random and have almost
exactly the same numbers of active neurons, the reliability of the yk neuron responses is extremely
high.)
However, as mentioned earlier, unlike the situation in knowledge links (where only a few of the
target symbol neurons receive connections from the transponder neurons of a source symbol), in
this case, all of the neurons of each active symbol must connect to each of the desired action
command neurons. Partial connectivity will not work here, since there is no feedback to implement
a ‘‘convergence’’ process. But the enormous local connectivity within Layer I is hypothesized to
make, achieving a sufﬁcient level of this connectivity no problem.
By incorporating inhibitory neurons into its intrinsic design, such a one-way Willshaw network
(with inhibition added) will only respond with a yk when its input is a newly active SINGLE symbol
(multiple symbols will fail to yield any association output because they induce excessive inhibition;
which shuts down all of the Layer V neurons). This is hypothesized to be why action commands are
only issued when a confabulation produces a single winning symbol. Also, when considering what
action to take for a given xk input, only those Layer V neurons having a sufﬁcient input excitation
will respond (much like in confabulation competitions). In other words, even near the beginning of
learning, when behavioral symbol to action associations are all weak, the Layer V response will be
based upon this ‘‘competitive’’ criterion, not a ﬁxed threshold.
That a vast majority of cortex would be involved in issuing thought action commands, as
opposed to movement action commands, makes sense because there are many more feature
attractor modules (and knowledge bases) than muscles. (It is not discussed here, but each know-
ledge base may also need to receive an ‘‘operate’’ command in order to function — if this is true,
this function probably involves the large ‘‘higher order’’ [Sherman and Guillery, 2001] portion of
the thalamus that is not included in the thalamocortical modules.) So it probably requires a much
larger portion of cortex to producing such thought process control action commands (muscle action
commands come mostly from Layer V of lexicons located within the relatively small primary motor
area of cortex).
Most action commands represent ‘‘low-level housekeeping functions’’ that are executed reﬂex-
ively whenever a single symbol (often one of a large set of symbols that will elicit the same action
command set) is expressed on a lexicon. For example, if a confabulation in a lexicon that is
recalling a stored action sequence (such lexicons are typically located in frontal cortex) ends in the
expression of a single action symbol, then that lexicon must be immediately erased and prepared for
generating the next sequence symbol. This is an action command that is issued along with the
expression of the current action sequence symbol. Overriding such reﬂexive thought progressions is
possible; but generally involves shutting off tonic cortical arousal (one of multiple adjuncts to the
lexicon operation command input) in a general cortical area via action commands issued to
brainstem thought nuclei. The result is a momentary freezing of the halted function as a new
thought process stream is inaugurated. This is what happens when we see that we are about to step
on dog poop. It takes a only fraction of a second for us to recover from the suspension of the
ongoing action and activate an alternative. Further, since muscle tone and rhythmic actions such as
walking are nominally controlled by other brain nuclei (not cortex and thalamus), all the cortex
typically needs to do (once the prior action sequence has been suspended) in such instances is issue
a momentary set of corrective alteration action commands which are instantly executed as a
momentary perturbation to the ongoing (subcortically automated) process, which then typically
resumes.
It is important to note that the details of how sequences of ‘‘action’’ symbols — each represent-
ing (via its symbol to action command association) a particular speciﬁc set of action commands that
will be launched every time that symbol is the sole conclusion of a confabulation — are learned,
stored, and recalled are the same as with all other cognitive knowledge. However, unlike many
122
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

other types of knowledge (e.g., sensory, event, or factual knowledge), only the action symbol
replay knowledge is rehearsed and solidiﬁed at night. The action symbol to action command
associations can only be learned and reﬁned via awake rehearsal. This accounts for the fact that
anyone learning a new skill will frequently ﬁnd themselves (either through vague memories of
dreams upon waking, or via reports from their sleep partner) carrying out ‘‘silent practice’’ of those
skills in their sleep. These do not involve launching the involved actions (a function that is normally
suppressed during sleep), but simply running through the involved action symbol sequences. Such
activities can help solidify the symbol sequences and this often yields improved skill performance
the next day.
Quite a bit of experience has been gained with learning and recalling action symbol sequences in
one of my UCSD graduate courses. For example, a checker-playing system that learns by expert-
guided rehearsal has been demonstrated. However, issues surrounding the replay of action sequence
hierarchies are complicated and not within the scope of an introductory chapter (e.g., provisions for
automatic real-time, moment-by-moment modiﬁcation of an ongoing lower-level action sequence
replay in response to the exact current state of the world; with no modiﬁcation at the higher level —
a process called instantiation — must be introduced). So action symbol sequence learning and
recall are not discussed in this chapter.
In summary, the theory proposes that the unidirectional symbol pair links used in confabulation
are the only knowledge learned and stored in cortex that is used in cognition. However, as described
in this section, there is a second kind of knowledge learned and stored in cortex: the associations
between each symbol and the action commands that its expression should launch. This knowledge
is not really part of cognition. It is the mapping from decisive cognitive conclusions (single active
symbols resulting from confabulations) to behaviors. Thus, the ultimate end product of cognition is
the origination of action commands; some of which are unconditionally executed immediately and
others, termed suggested actions, must be approved (vetted) by the basal ganglia before they can be
executed.
3.A.7
Discussion
The theory’s hypothesized cortical implementation of knowledge links has some important
universal properties. First, the locally random wiring of the cortical axons can be established during
development and then frozen, essentially for life (although there may be a very slow replenishment
of some types of neurons throughout life that helps keep the brain functional as neurons slowly die;
but this has not been established — the vast majority of neurons probably live a very long time,
perhaps for the full life span of the individual). Knowledge links, by means of a parallel, two-step
synﬁre chain communication process through the random cortical signaling network, can be
immediately formed, as appropriate, between almost any two symbols in any two lexicons that
genetics have provided connection possibilities for. A link can be temporarily established instantly
(via the short-term memory mechanism) and then, if it is warranted, the link can be progressively
transformed into permanent knowledge during the subsequent few sleep periods.
The price of this ability to instantly learn almost anything without need for rewiring (to carry out
such wiring by growing new axons would take days and would require the involved axons to have
unbelievable navigation abilities) is probably a vast over-wiring of cortex. A prediction of the
theory is that only roughly 1% of cortical synapses are actually used to store knowledge (i.e., have
been strengthened). The rest are there to provide the capacity for instant arbitrary learning. Thus,
the old saw that ‘‘we only use 10% of our brain’’ is probably wrong on the high side. Ninety nine
percent of unstrengthened synapses are hypothesized to simply be sitting around waiting to be
needed. This may seem wasteful; but unstrengthened cortical knowledge synapses and axon
collaterals are small, and humans have about 1014 to 1015 of them (Mountcastle, 1998; Nicholls
et al., 2001; Nolte, 1999; Steward, 2000). Clearly, the survival value of instant arbitrary learning
vastly outweighs whatever inefﬁciency is incurred. This hypothesis helps explain one of the most
Mechanization of Cognition
123

puzzling ﬁndings of neuroscience: the vast majority of synapses that have ever been individually
evaluated (e.g., by manipulating them, and monitoring their effects on the target cell, using multiple
patch clamps [Cowan et al., 2001]) have turned out to be very unreliable and only marginally
functional. This is exactly what you would expect to ﬁnd if 99% of synapses are in a state of
minimal existence, awaiting the possible moment that they will be needed.
Humans live for roughly 3  109 sec. So, for example, if we acquire an average of one item of
knowledge during every second of life (86,400 knowledge items per day), and if an average of 300
transponder neuron synapses are used to implement each knowledge item, far less than 1% of all
synapses will ever be used (of course, not all cortical synapses are available for knowledge storage,
but most probably are, so this conclusion is still probably correct). So, the theory proposes that the
potential amount of cognitive knowledge that can be stored is huge.
In my laboratory’s computer implementations of confabulation, a startling fact (which is
consistent with the above numbers) has emerged: a staggeringly large number of knowledge
items is needed to do even simple cognitive functions. The theory postulates that the average
human must possess billions of items of knowledge. This has many startling and profound
implications, and assuming that the theory gains acceptance, many philosophical and educational
views of humans (and other animals) will likely be completely altered. For example, the theory
implies that children (and adults too!) probably accumulate tens of thousands, or more, new
individual items of knowledge every day. Thus, the process of reconsidering each day’s short-
and medium-term memories and converting selected ones into a more permanent form is a huge
job. It is no wonder that we must sleep a third of the time.
To appreciate the vast storage capacity of your cerebral cortex, imagine for a moment that you
are being asked a long series of detailed questions about the kitchen in your home. Describe all of
the spoons and where they are kept; then the forks, the drinking glasses, and so on. Describe how
you select and employ each item. Where and when you obtained it, and some memorable occasions
when it was used. Obviously, such a process could go on for tens of hours and still turn up lots of
new kitchen information. Now consider that you could probably answer such detailed questions for
thousands of mental arenas. Humans are phenomenally smart.
Another cortical property, which the theory’s hypothesized design of cortex imparts, is an
insensitivity to occasional random neuronal death. If a few of the transponder neurons which
represent a particular symbol randomly die, the remaining knowledge links from this symbol
continue to function. Newly created replenishment neurons (which the theory proposes arise
throughout life) which turn out to have the appropriate connectivity (once they have spread out
and connected up and reached maturation), can be incorporated into such a weakened link to
replace lost neurons; assuming the link is used from time to time.
If a link is not used for a long time, then as the transponder neurons of its source symbol slowly
get redeployed (see below) or die, the axons to the target symbol neurons of the link will not be
replenished and the link will become gradually weaker (other links having the same source symbol,
which are used, will not suffer this fate because they will be replenished). Eventually, the unused
link will become so weak that it cannot function by itself. Sometimes, when a link has become
weak, but is not completely gone, it can be used if accompanied by additional assumed fact inputs to
the same target symbol — a faded-memory recall trick known popularly as mnemonics. This is the
theory’s explanation for why we forget long-disused knowledge.
Another aspect of the hardware failure tolerance of cortex is the primary representation of each
symbol within its own lexicon. With tens or hundreds of neurons representing each symbol, the
lexicons symbols too have some redundancy and failure tolerance.
When new inputs to a cortical lexicon arise which do not ﬁt any of the existing symbols well,
and continue to appear repeatedly, new symbols can be formed, even in adulthood. Depending on
how close to capacity the involved lexicon is, these new symbols may or may not displace existing
symbols. This lexicon rebuilding process is often used to add new symbols to lexicons when we
learn a subject in more depth (e.g., when we take Calculus III after having already taken Calculus
124
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

I and Calculus II). Total rebuilding of a lexicon typically only occurs in the event of trauma (e.g.,
stroke), where the entire information input environment to the lexicon has dramatically changed.
Total rebuilding takes weeks and requires lots of practice with the new symbols. This is why
recovery of function after a stroke takes so long and why intensive physical and mental therapy
based upon practice and use is so important. Aspects of childhood development are being recap-
itulated on an abbreviated schedule.
Lexicons also slowly incorporate replenishment neurons into existing symbol representations
that are used. As with forgetting of knowledge; long-disused symbols eventually have their sets of
representing neurons redeployed (see below) or eroded beyond functionality. A person who spoke
French when he was a child, but who has not used French at all for 40 years, will likely have many
of the French word representation symbols eroded beyond recovery.
The only instance of deliberate fast cognitive knowledge erasure in human cortex is redeploy-
ment, where a source symbol in a lexicon, which used to be linked to a particular set of target
symbols in other lexicons, suddenly has an entirely new ensemble of links to new target symbols
arise for it, and these new links persist (and the old ones are disused). For example, when we move
to a new home, it may be necessary to learn that the alarm clock is now on the left side of the bed,
not the right. What happens in this instance is that the sets of transponder neurons representing the
involved source symbol have a ﬁnite limit to the number of highly strengthened synapses that they
can have at any time (this probably has to do with a total individual cellular limit on synthesis of
certain consumable biochemicals — the critical ones of which are produced only in the neuron’s
soma and dendrites, where the ribosomes reside). (Note: The ultimate limit to knowledge storage
capacity is not synapses; it is the number of strengthened synapses that each transponder neuron can
support at one time. There are probably people [e.g., perhaps the author] who have spent their entire
lives studying and who reached this capacity limit long ago.) As the transponder neuron synapses
implementing the many new links are learned and strengthened, many of the old, now unused, links
must be immediately sacriﬁced (their synapses shrivel to the unstrengthened state). Within a few
weeks, we instinctively reach left. The old knowledge has been effectively erased. The synapses of
many of the old knowledge links have shriveled (but not all of them; some remnant knowledge links
often remain — which you can experience by revisiting one of your old haunts and trying to carry
out formerly familiar patterns; like skipping down stairs at a childhood residence). Fragments of
your former knowledge will still be there.
Redeployment is a critical cognitive capability that allows us to adapt to environmental change
quickly. It is also hypothesized to be the only mechanism of deliberate forgetting in cognition.
Finally, it is important to note that any global theory of human cerebral cortex and thalamus is
bound to be vastly oversimpliﬁed. For example, it is well known (Paxinos and Mai, 2004) that
different areas of cortex have some Layers dramatically attenuated (e.g., Layer IV in certain areas
of frontal cortex). Others have Layers that are dramatically elaborated (e.g., in primary visual
cortex, Layer IV becomes tripartite). These local modiﬁcations almost certainly must have signiﬁ-
cant meaning for the nuances of function. However, the theory proposes that these are all relatively
small variations of the same overall grand theme.
The central notion of the theory: that cognition, that greatest engine of animal ennoblement, is
universally mechanized by one information processing operation (confabulation) employing a
single form of knowledge (antecedent support), with each singular conclusion reached launching
an associated set of action commands; seems to me to now be secure. The concreteness and
speciﬁcity of this theory guarantees that it is testable.

INTRODUCTION
Can a computer ultimately augment or replace human invention?
Imagine a Lego set at your disposal: Bricks, rods, wheels, motors, sensors, and logic are your
‘‘atomic’’ building blocks, and you must ﬁnd a way to put them together to achieve a given high-
level functionality: A machine that can move itself, say. You know the physics of the individual
components’ behaviors; you know the repertoire of pieces available, and you know how they
are allowed to connect. But how do you determine the combination that gives you the desired
129

functionality? This is the problem of Synthesis. Although engineers practice it and teach it all the
time, we do not have a formal model of how open-ended synthesis can be done automatically.
Applications are numerous. This is the meta-problem of engineering: Design a machine that can
design other machines.
The example above is conﬁned to electromechanics, but similar synthesis challenges occur in
almost all engineering disciplines: circuits, software, structures, robotics, control, and MEMS to
name a few. Are there fundamental properties of design synthesis that cut across engineering ﬁelds?
Can a computer ultimately augment or replace human invention?
While we may not know how to synthesize things automatically, nature may give us some clues;
after all, the fascinating products of nature were designed and fabricated autonomously.
In the last two centuries, engineering sciences have made remarkable progress in the ability
to analyze and predict physical phenomena. We understand the governing equations of thermo-
dynamics, elastics, ﬂuid ﬂow, and electromagnetics to name a few domains. Numerical
methods such as ﬁnite elements allow us to solve these differential equations, with good approxi-
mation, for many practical situations. We can use these methods to investigate and explain
observations, as well as to predict the behavior of products and systems long before they are
physically realized.
But progress in systematic synthesis has been much slower. For example, the systematic
synthesis of a kinematic machine for a given purpose is a long-standing problem, and perhaps
one of the earliest general synthesis problems to be posed. Robert Willis, a professor of natural and
experimental philosophy at Cambridge, wrote in 1841:
[A rational approach to synthesis is needed] to obtain, by direct and certain methods, all the forms
and arrangements that are applicable to the desired purpose. At present, questions of this kind
can only be solved by that species of intuition that which long familiarity with the subject usually
confers upon experienced persons, but which they are totally unable to communicate to others. When
the mind of a mechanician is occupied with the contrivance of a machine, he must wait until, in the
midst of his meditations, some happy combination presents itself to his mind which may answer
his purpose.
Robert Willis, Principles of Mechanism (Willis, 1841)
Almost two centuries later, a rational method for synthesis in many domains is still not clear.
Though many best-practice design methodologies exist, at the end of the day they rely on elusive
human creativity. Product design is still taught today largely through apprenticeship: engineering
students learn about existing solutions and techniques for well-deﬁned, relatively simple problems,
and then — through practice — are expected to improve and combine these to create larger, more
complex systems. How is this synthesis process achieved? We do not know, but we cloak it with the
term ‘‘creativity.’’
The question of how synthesis of complex systems occurs has been divided in a dichotomy
of two views. One view is that complex systems emerge through successive adaptations coupled
with natural selection. This Darwinian process is well accepted in biology, but is more controversial
in engineering (Basalla, 1989; Ziman, 2003). The alternative explanation is intelligent design,
mostly rejected in biology, but still dominant in engineering — as the celebrated revolutionary
inventor.
The process of successive adaptation by improvement and recombination of basic building
blocks is evolutionary in its nature. Unlike classical genetic algorithms (e.g., Goldberg, 1989,
Chapter 5), however, it is open-ended: We do not know a´ priori what components we will need and
how many of them. The permutation space is exponential, and complexity is unbounded. This is
perhaps a subtle but key difference between optimization (e.g., Papadimitriou and Steiglitz, 1998)
and synthesis. In optimization problems, we tune the values of a set of parameters in order to
130
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

maximize a target function. The set of parameters, their meaning, and their ranges are predeter-
mined. Synthesis, on the other hand, is an open-ended process, where we can add more and more
components, possibly each with their own set of parameters. Consider, for example, a case where
we need to design a new electronic circuit that performs some target function. One approach would
be to manually provide a basic layout of resistors, capacitors, and coils, and then try to automat-
ically tweak their values so as to maximize performance. Alternatively, we could start with a bucket
of components, and use an algorithm to automatically compose them into a circuit that performs the
target function. The former would be a case of optimization, and the latter an example of synthesis.
There are numerous examples and many books dedicated to the application of evolutionary
optimization in almost any engineering domain (e.g., Gen and Cheng, 1999; Zalzala and Fleming,
1999; Jamshidi et al., 2002; Karr and Freeman, 1998; Mazumder and Rudnick, 1998), but the use of
evolution for open-ended design remains relatively unexplored, yet has the highest potential impact
in its ability to ‘‘think outside the box.’’
4.1.1
Structure of This Chapter
As we shall see in the next few sections, we can use many of the ideas of biological evolutionary
adaptation to inspire computational synthesis methods. To keep things intuitive, we shall describe
some of these methods in the context of designing electromechanical machines, such as robots, and
in particular legged robots. But these methods can be (and indeed have been) applied to numerous
engineering application areas. This chapter is not intended to be a comprehensive review of
evolutionary robotics or of evolutionary design research. Instead I have chosen a small set of
results that portray an interesting perspective of the ﬁeld and where it is going. These results are not
necessarily in chronological order — scientiﬁc discoveries are not always made in an order most
conducive for learning. Interested readers are encouraged to see the ‘‘further reading’’ section for
more in-depth and broader reviews.
4.2
A SIMPLE MODEL OF EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATION
There are a variety of computational models of open-ended synthesis loosely inspired by natural
evolutionary adaptation. Perhaps the simplest approach uses a direct representation. We start off
with a large set of initial candidate designs — this is the initial population. These designs may be
random, blank, or may be seeded with some prior knowledge in the form of solutions we think
are good starting points. We then begin evolving this population through repeated selection and
variation. To perform selection, we ﬁrst measure the performance of each solution in the popula-
tion. The performance, ﬁtness in evolutionary terminology, captures the merit of the design with
respect to some target performance we are seeking as designers. The ﬁtness metric needs to be
solution-neutral, i.e., measure the extent to which the target task has been achieved, regardless
of how it was achieved. We select better solutions ( parents) and use them to create a new
generation of solutions (offspring). The offspring are variations of the parents, created
through variation operators like mutation and recombination. The process is repeated generation
after generation until good solutions are found.
In practice, there are many modiﬁcations to the simple process described above. We use
special representations, clever selection methods, sophisticated variation, evaluation methods,
as well as multiple co-evolving populations. Most interestingly, we let the representations
and the evaluation methods evolve too, to allow for a more open-ended search. Mitchell (1996)
provides a review of many of these processes. Let us look at some simple examples applied
to robotics.

4.3
MACHINE BODIES AND BRAINS
Many systems, including robotic systems in particular, are often viewed as comprising two major
parts: the morphology and the controller. The morphology is the physical structure of the system,
and the controller is a separate unit that governs the behavior of the morphology by setting the states
of actuators and reading sensory data. In nature, we often refer to these as the body and brain,
respectively. In control theory, we refer to these as the plant and the control (the term plant, as
in ‘‘manufacturing plant,’’ is used because of the original industrial applications). In computer
engineering terms, this often translates into hardware and software. This distinction is semantic; we
simply tend to refer to the part which is more easily adaptable as control and the part that is ﬁxed as
the morphology. In practice, both the morphology and control contribute to the overall behavior of
the system and the distinction between them is blurred. Very often a particular morphology
accounts for some of the control and the control is embedded in the morphology. Nevertheless,
in describing the application of evolutionary design to systems, we ﬁnd this distinction pedagogic-
ally useful.
In the following sections, we will see a series of examples of the application of evolutionary
processes to open-ended synthesis. These examples were chosen to illustrate the design of robotic
systems for their intuitiveness, starting at control and moving on to both control and morphology.
Following these examples, we will take a look at the common principles, and future challenges.
4.3.1
Evolving Controllers
It is perhaps easier, both conceptually and technically, to explore application of evolutionary
techniques to the design of robot controllers before using it to evolve their morphologies too.
Robot controllers can be represented in any one of a number of ways: as logic functions (‘‘if–then–
else’’ rules), as ﬁnite state machines, as programs, as sets of differential equations, or as neural
networks to name a few. Many of the experiments that follow represent the controller as a neural
network that maps sensory input to actuator outputs. These networks can have many architectures,
such as feed-forward or recurrent. Sometimes the choice of architecture is left to the synthesis
algorithm.
Some of the early experiments in this area performed by Beer and Gallagher (1992). Nolﬁand
Floreano (2004), Harvey et al. (1997), and Meyer (1998) review many interesting experiments
evolving controllers for wheeled and gantry robots, but let us look at some examples with legged
robots. Consider a case where we have a legged robot morphology ﬁtted with actuators and sensors,
and we would like to use evolutionary methods to evolve a controller that would make this machine
move (locomote) towards an area of high chemical concentration. Bongard (2002) explored this
concept on a legged robot in a physically realistic simulator. The robot has four legs and eight rotary
actuators as shown in Figure 4.1a. It has four touch sensors at the feet, which output a binary signal
depending on weather or not they are touching the ground. The machine also has four angle sensors
at the knees, outputting a graded signal depending on the actual angle of the knee. There are two
chemical sensors at the top, which output a value corresponding to the chemical level they sense
locally.
The behavior of the machine is determined by a neural controller that maps sensors to actuators,
as shown in Figure 4.1b. Inputs of candidate neural controllers were connected to the sensors, and
their output connected directly to the eight motors. Machines were rewarded for their ability to
reach the area with high concentration. The ﬁtness was evaluated by trying out a candidate
controller in four different concentration ﬁelds, and summing up the distance between the ﬁnal
position of the robot and the highest concentration point. The shorter the distance the better — and
in this sense the total distance is a performance error. In this experiment, 200 candidate controllers
were evolved for 50 generations. The variation operators could decide if and how to connect the
neurons. Figure 4.1c shows the progress of this error over generational time. The performance of
132
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

one successful controller in four different chemical concentration ﬁelds is shown in Figure 4.1d.
The white trails, which mark the progress of the center of mass of the robot over time, show clearly
how the robot moves towards high concentration.
But what is more striking about this experiment is that the robot learned to perform essentially
two tasks: to locomote and to change orientation towards the high concentration. When the
chemical sensors are disabled, the robot moves forward but not towards the chemical concentration
(see black trail in Figure 4.1d). This shows that the network evolved two independent functions:
locomotion and gradient tracking.
Can this process also work for a real (not simulated) legged robot? We recently tried evolving
controllers for a dynamical, legged robot (Zykov et al., 2004). The nine-legged machine is
composed of two Stewart platforms back to back. The platforms are powered by 12 pneumatic
linear actuators, with power coming from an onboard 4500 psi paintball canister. While most
robotic systems use position-controlled actuators whose exact extension can be set, pneumatic
actuators of the kind used here are force-controlled. Like biological muscle, the controller can
specify the force and duration of the actuation, but not the position. It is therefore a challenging
control problem. The controller architecture for this machine was an open-loop pattern generator
that determines when to open and close pneumatic valves. The on–off pattern was evolved;

candidate controllers were evaluated by trying them out on the robot in a cage, and measuring
ﬁtness using a camera that tracks the red ball on the foot of one of the legs of the machine (see inset
in Figure 4.2b for a view from the camera). Snapshots from one of the best evolved gates are
shown in Figure 4.2c. Walker et al. (2004) provide a review of controller evolution on both
simulated and physical machines.

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

Manual design of a neural controller for a legged machine of this sort is possible, but not
easy. The advantage of design automation here is that a design was found with minimal prior
information on how it should be done. We could now reverse engineer the evolved controller to ﬁnd
out exactly how it works — like biologists. Should the morphology or the task change, we can have
the process redesign new controllers. The evolutionary architecture described here was rather
simple; many more sophisticated neural controller architectures and evolutionary processes are
being explored, such as the use of plasticity (controllers that can learn after they have been
evolved), controllers that grow, and other types of neurons such as spiking neurons (Nolﬁet al.,
1994; Floreano and Urzelai, 2001; Floreano et al., 2001, 2005).
4.3.2
Evolving Controllers and Some Aspects of the Morphology
Design of a robot involves not only the design of controller, but the morphology as well. What
happens if some aspects of the morphological design are also allowed to evolve? For example, Lund
et al. (1997) explored the effect of evolutionary adaptation of physical placement of sensors in a
wheeled robot and showed improved performance. Let us examine this process in context of a
legged machine.
Paul and Bongard (2001) used evolutionary adaptation to evolve designs for a bipedal robot in
simulation, as shown in Figure 4.3a. The machine comprises the bottom half of a walker with six
motors (two at each hip and one in each knee), a touch sensor at each foot and an angle sensor at
each joint. The ﬁtness of a controller was the net distance it could make a machine travel. The
controllers had architecture similar to that shown in Figure 4.1b, with the appropriate number of
inputs and outputs.
Evolving 300 controllers over 300 generations created various controllers that could make the
machine move while keeping it upright. Figure 4.3b shows the maximum ﬁtness per generation for
a number of independent runs. While many did not make much progress, some runs were able to
ﬁnd good controllers, as evident by the curves with high ﬁtness. More importantly, however, was
that this time the evolutionary process was also allowed to vary the mass distribution of the robot
morphology and that this new freedom allowed it to ﬁnd good solutions. This may suggest that
evolving a controller for a ﬁxed morphology may be too restrictive, and that better machines might
be found if both the controller and the morphology are allowed to coevolve, as they do in nature.
This lends some credibility to the notion of concurrent engineering, where several aspects of a

product are engineered in concert rather than sequentially. Some small changes to the morphology
may make the controller design task much simpler and vice versa.
4.3.3
Evolving Bodies and Brains
One may wonder what happens if the evolutionary process is given even more freedom in the
design of both the morphology and control. Sims (1994) explored this idea in simulation using 3D
cubes and oscillators as building blocks. Inspired by that work, we were interested in exploring
physically realizable machines and start with lower-level building blocks, such as simple neurons
and 1D elements (Lipson and Pollack, 2000). We used a design space consisting of bars and linear
actuators for the morphology and neurons for the control (Figure 4.4a). The design space we used
comprised bars and actuators as building blocks of structure and artiﬁcial neurons as building
blocks of control. Bars connected with free joints can potentially form trusses that represent
arbitrary rigid, ﬂexible, and articulated structures, as well as multiple detached structures, and
emulate revolute, linear, and planar joints at various levels of hierarchy. Similarly, sigmoidal
neurons can connect to create arbitrary control architectures such as feed-forward and recurrent
nets, state machines and multiple independent controllers. The bars can connect to each other
through ball-and-socket joints, neurons can connect to other neurons through synaptic connections,
and neurons can connect to bars. In the latter case, the length of the bar is governed by the output
of the neuron by means of a linear actuator. No sensors were used. Variation operators used in the
evolutionary process were allowed to connect, disconnect, add, remove, or modify any of the
components.
Starting with a population of 200 blank machines that were comprised initially of zero bars
and zero neurons, we conducted evolution in simulation. The ﬁtness of a machine was determined
by its locomotion ability: the net distance its center of mass moved on an inﬁnite plane in a ﬁxed
duration. The process iteratively selected ﬁtter machines, created offspring by adding, modifying,
and removing building blocks and replaced them into the population. This process typically
continued for 300 to 600 generations. Both body (morphology) and brain (control) were thus
coevolved simultaneously. The simulator we used for evaluating ﬁtness supported quasi-static
motion in which each frame is statically stable. This kind of motion is simpler to transfer reliably
into reality, yet is rich enough to support low-momentum locomotion.
Typically, several tens of generations passed before the ﬁrst movement occurred. For example,
at a minimum, a neural network generating varying output must assemble and connect to an
actuator for any motion at all (see sequence in Figure 4.4a, for an example). A sample instance
of an entire generation, thinned down to unique individuals is shown in Figure 4.4b. Various
patterns of evolutionary dynamics emerged, some of which are reminiscent of natural phylogenic
trees. Figure 4.4c presents examples of extreme cases of convergence, speciation, and massive
extinction, and Figure 4.4d shows progress over time of one evolutionary run. Figure 4.4e shows
some of the ﬁtter machines that emerged from this process; these machines were ‘‘copied’’ from
simulation into reality using rapid-prototyping technology (Figure 4.4f). The machines performed
in reality, showing the ﬁrst instance of a physical robot whose entire design — both morphology
and control — were evolved.
In spite of the relatively simple task and environment (locomotion over an inﬁnite horizontal
plane), surprisingly different and elaborate solutions were evolved. Machines typically contained
around 20 building blocks, sometimes with signiﬁcant redundancy (perhaps to make mutation less
likely to be catastrophic). Not less surprising was the fact that some exhibited symmetry, which was
neither speciﬁed nor rewarded for anywhere in the code; a possible explanation is that symmetric
machines are more likely to move in a straight line, consequently covering a greater net distance
and acquiring more ﬁtness. Similarly, successful designs appear to be robust in the sense that
changes to bar lengths would not signiﬁcantly hamper their mobility. The three samples shown in
Figure 4.4d exploit principles of ratcheting, anti-phase synchronization, and dragging. Others (not
136

shown here) used a sort of a crawling bi-pedalism, where a body resting on the ﬂoor is advanced
using alternating thrusts of left and right ‘‘limbs.’’ Some mechanisms used sliding articulated
components to produce crab-like sideways motion. Other machines used a balancing mechanism
to shift friction point from side to side and advance by oscillatory motion. Taylor and Massey
(2001) provide a review of several works on evolution of morphologies.

4.4
MORPHOLOGY REPRESENTATIONS
The examples above used mostly a direct encoding — a representation of the morphology and
control that evolution uses to explicitly modify each aspect of the design, adding, removing, and
modifying components and parameters directly. Clearly, however, such an approach would not
work in nature, for an average animal body contains billions of cells. Nature typically uses a more
compact representation — a genotype — to encode for a much more complex machine — the
phenotype. The genotype does not directly encode the phenotype, but instead it encodes informa-
tion for growing or developing, a phenotype. This is one form of an indirect representation that
maps between a genotype and a phenotype. In nature, these maps are evolving themselves and
several hierarchical layers of mappings are used before a real DNA yields a working phenotype.
The use of a genotype–phenotype mapping allows for many advantages, primarily the com-
pactness of a description and the ability to reuse components (more on that later). How can we use
these representations computationally?
Mechanisms and neural networks can both be described as graphs. Luke and Spector (1996)
survey a number of different representations used to describe or ‘‘grow’’ graphs, such as neural
networks. Some methods use context-free grammars, L-systems, and parse trees operating on nodes
and edges. Most of the existing representations for encoding networks generate highly connected
architectures that are suitable for computational networks, but which are less suitable for kinematic
machines because they over-constrain the motion and create deadlocked mechanisms. Using these
representations, the likelihood of generating a mechanism with a speciﬁc number of degrees of
freedom (DoF) is vanishingly small. In order to allow an evolutionary algorithm to explore the
space of one DoF mechanisms more efﬁciently, a more suitable representation is required.
A second consideration in the choice of representation is evolvability. Many of the representa-
tions cited above result in context-sensitive and order-sensitive description of a network. For
example, the structure generated by a branch in Gruau’s cellular encoding depends on whether it
is parsed before or after its sibling branch. If that branch is transplanted by cross-over into another
tree, it may produce an entirely different structure. Such behavior hampers the effectiveness of
recombinative operators by precluding the formation of modular components that are discovered by
the search in one place and then reused elsewhere. A representation where the structure produced by
a branch of the tree is minimally affected by its context may thus be more evolvable.
4.4.1
Tree Representations
Tree-based representations can describe a set of operations to construct a phenotype in a top-down
or bottom-up manner. A top-down representation starts with an initial structure (an embryo) and
speciﬁes a sequence of operations that progressively modify it into its ﬁnal form. Figure 4.5a shows
a top-down tree that speciﬁes the construction of an electric circuit, starting with an initial circuit
and recursively replacing circuit segments with serial and parallel arrangements of electrical
components (Koza, 1992). Each node of the tree is either an operator that modiﬁed the circuit
and passes segments to its child nodes, or a terminal electrical component. The speciﬁc parallel
and serial operators cannot be used for construction of mechanisms as they will immediately create
over- and under-constrained kinematic chains. Because of the physics of electric circuits, ordering
of children under a parent does not matter. This tree is thus both order independent and context
independent. In a top-down tree, parent nodes must be constructed before their children. Figure 4.5a
also shows a bottom-up construction of a symbolic expression. Here terminal nodes represent
constants or variables, and parent nodes represent mathematical operators. Because of the nature
of mathematical expressions, parsing order is important, and swapping order of some child nodes
would result in a mathematically different expression. The terms are unchanged, however, by the
content of their siblings. This tree is thus order dependent but context independent. In a bottom-up
tree, child nodes must be constructed before their parents.
138
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

How could a tree representation be used to describe robot morphologies? Top-down construc-
tion of a mechanism starts with an embryonic kinematic basis with the desired number of DoFs,
such as the four-bar mechanism shown in Figure 4.5c. A tree of operators then recursively modiﬁes
that mechanism by replacing single links (DoF ¼ 1, i.e., over-constrained) with assemblies of
links with an equivalent DoF, so that the total number of DoF remains unchanged. Two such
transformations are shown in Figure 4.5c: the D and T operators. The D operator creates a new node
and connects it to both the endpoints of a given link, essentially creating a rigid triangular

139

component. The T operator replaces a given link with two links that pass through a newly created
node. The new node is also connected to some other existing node. In both operators, the position of
the new nodes is speciﬁed in coordinates local to link being modiﬁed.
The T operator speciﬁes the external connecting node by providing coordinates relative to link
being modiﬁed; the closest available node from the parent structure is used. This form of speciﬁ-
cation helps assure the operators remain as context and order independent as possible. Figure 4.5c
shows how a certain sequence of operators will transform a dyad into a triad. Figure 4.5c also shows
how application of a tree of operators to the embryonic mechanism will transform it into an
arbitrary compound mechanism with exactly one DoF. Terminals of the tree are the actual links
of the mechanism.
Alternatively, bottom-up construction of a one-DoF mechanism begins at the leaves of the tree
with atomic building blocks and hierarchically assembles them into components. The atomic
building block is a dyad as shown in Figure 4.4a, and has exactly one DoF when grounded. The
composition operator ensures that the total number of DoF is not changed when two subcomponents
are combined, and thus the total product of the tree will also be a mechanism with exactly one DoF.
When combining two components, each of one DoF, the resulting assembly will have ﬁve DoF (one
DoF from each, plus three DoF released by ungrounding one of the components). The total DoF is
restored to one by eliminating four DoF through the merging of two point pairs. An example of this
process is shown in Figure 4.5d. Note that points must be merged in a way that avoids overlapping
constraints, such as causing two links to merge. The components may need to be scaled and oriented
for the merger to work. The ground link of the entire structure is speciﬁed at the root of the tree.
Figure 4.5b shows an application of this representation to the design of a single DoF mechanism
that when actuated traces a nearly exact straight line, without reference to an existing straight line.
This problem may seem somewhat arbitrary, but it was of major practical importance in the 19th
century and many notable inventors, including James Watt, spent a considerable amount of time
developing mechanisms to meet this requirement as the bootstrap of precision manufacturing. It
therefore serves as a nice benchmark for the ‘‘inventiveness’’ of the algorithm. Using evolutionary
computation based on tree representations, we were able to evolve machines, from scratch, that
infringe and outperform previous established designs (Lipson, 2006).
4.4.2
Developmental Representations
Other types of representations allow the robot’s morphology to develop from a basic ‘‘seed’’ and a
set of context-free development rules. Consider, for example, the two rules ‘‘A!B’’ and ‘‘B!AB.’’
If we start with the seed ‘‘A,’’ and apply these two rules wherever they are applicable, the seed will
develop as follows: A!B!AB!BAB!ABBAB!BABABBAB . . . , and so forth. A seed and
two simple rules can thus create very complex and elaborate structures. This type of representation,
similar to an L-system or cellular automaton, can be applied to evolving morphologies and
controllers of robots.
We start with a constructor that can build a machine from a sequence of build commands. The
language of build commands is based on instructions to a LOGO-style turtle, which direct it to
move forward, backward or rotate about a coordinate axis. Robots are constructed from rods and
joints that are placed along the turtle’s path (Figure 4.6a). Actuated joints are created by commands
that direct the turtle to move forward and place an actuated joint at its new location with oscillatory
motion and a given offset. The operators ‘‘[’’and ‘‘]’’ push and pop the current state — consisting of
the current rod, current orientation, and current joint oscillation offset — to and from a stack.
Forward moves the turtle forward in the current direction, creating a rod if none exists or traversing
to the end of the existing rod. Backward goes back up the parent of the current rod. The rotation
commands turn the turtle about the Z-axis in steps of 608, for 2D robots, and about the X, Y or
Z-axes, in steps of 908, for 3D robots. Joint commands move the turtle forward, creating a rod, and
end with an actuated joint. The parameter to these commands speciﬁes the speed at which the joint
140
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

oscillates, using integer values from 0 to 5, and the relative phase-offset of the oscillation cycle is
taken from the turtle’s state. The commands ‘‘increase-offset’’ and ‘‘decrease-offset’’ change the
offset value n the turtle’s state by +25% of a total cycle. Command sequences enclosed by ‘‘{}’’
are repeated a number of times speciﬁed by the brackets’ argument.

For example, the string {joint(1) [joint(1) forward(1)] clockwise(2)}(3) produces the robot
in Figure 4.6b, through the development process shown in Figure 6a. Constructed robots do not
have a central controller; rather each joint oscillates independent of the others. In Figure 4.6
large crosses are used to show the location of actuated joints and small crosses show unactuated
joints. The left image shows the robot with all actuated joints in their starting orientation and
the image on the right shows the same robot with all actuated joints at the other extreme of their
actuation cycle. In this example, all actuated joints are moving in phase.
These strings were generated using an L-system. The L-systems are a set of rules like the
‘‘A!B’’ and ‘‘B!AB’’ rules discussed above. However, this time these ‘‘rewrite’’ rules are
parametric (i.e., may pass parameters), and have conditions (are executed only when the parameters
meet some conditions).
For example, the L-system to produce the robot in Figure 4.6b consists of two rules with each
rule containing two condition-successor pairs:
P0(n): n > 2 !
{P0(n1)}(n)
n > 0 !
joint(1) P1(n  2) clockwise(2)
P1(n): n > 2 !
[P1(n/4)]
n > 0 !
joint(1) forward(1)
If the L-system is started with P0(3), the resulting sequence of strings is produced:
P0(3)
{P0(2)}(3)
{joint(1) P1(4) clockwise(2)}(3)
{joint(1) [P1(1)] clockwise(2)}(3)
{joint(1) [joint(1) forward(1)] clockwise(2)}(3)
which produces the robot in Figure 4.6b.
An evolutionary algorithm was used to evolve individual L-systems, that when executed
produced a build sequence which produced the machine. Approximately half the runs produced
‘‘interesting’’ viable results. The two main forms of locomotion found used one or more oscillating
appendages to push along, or had two main body parts connected by a sequence of rods that
twisted in such a way that ﬁrst one half of the robot would rotate forward, then the other. Some
examples of successful machines are shown in Figure 4.6c and their physical instantiations are
shown in Figure 4.6d.
A comparison of robots evolved using the developmental encoding to robots whose construction
sequence was evolved directly revealed that robots evolved with the generative representation not
only had higher average ﬁtness, but also tended to move in a more continuous manner. In general,
robots evolved using the generative representation increased their speed by repeating rolling
segments to smoothen out their gaits, and increasing the size of these segments or appendages to
increase the distance moved in each oscillation.
One of the fundamental questions is whether the actual grammar evolved in the successful
L-systems has captured some of the intrinsic properties of the design space. A way to quantify this
is to measure the correlation between ﬁtness change and a random mutation of various sizes, and
compare this with the correlation observed in random mutations on the nongenerative represen-
tation as a control experiment. If the observed correlation is distinguishable and better for the
generative system than it is for the blind system, then the generative system must have captured
some useful properties.
The plot in Figure 4.6e is a comparison of the ﬁtness-mutation correlation between a generative
representation and a random control experiment on the same substrate and on the same set of
142
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

randomly selected individuals. For this analysis, 80,000 individuals were selected uniformly from
16 runs and over 100 generations using a generative representation. Each point represents a
particular ﬁtness change (positive or negative) associated with a particular mutation size. The
points on the left plot of Figure 4.6e were carried out on the nongenerative representation generated
by the generative representation and serve as the control set. For these points, 1 to 6 mutations
were applied so as to approximate mutations of similar phenotypic-size as those on the generative
representation. Each mutation could modify or swap a sequence of characters. The points on
the right of Figure 4.6e were also carried out randomly but on the generative representations
of the same randomly selected individuals. Only a single mutation was applied to the generative
representation, and consisted of modifying or swapping a single keyword or parameter. Mutation
size was measured in both cases as the number of modiﬁed commands in the ﬁnal construction
sequences.
The two distributions in Figure 4.6e have distinct features. The data points separate into two
distinguishable clusters, with some overlap. Mutations generated on the generative representations
clearly correlate with both positive ﬁtness and negative ﬁtness changes, whereas most mutations on
the nongenerative representation result in ﬁtness decrease. Statistics of both systems, averaged over
8 runs each, reveal that the two means are different with at least 95% conﬁdence. Cross-correlation
showed that in 40% of the instances where a nongenerative mutation was successful, a generative
mutation was also successful, whereas in only 20% of the instances where a generative mutation
was successful, was a nongenerative mutation successful too. In both cases smaller mutations are
signiﬁcantly more successful than larger mutations. However, large mutations (>100) were an
order of magnitude more likely to be successful in the generative case than in the nongenerative
case. All these measures indicate that the generative representation is more efﬁcient in exploiting
useful search paths in the design space.
4.4.3
Regulatory Network Representations
The way that morphologies of organisms develop in biology is not only dependent on their
genotype; many other environmental effects play an important role. The ontology of an organism
depends on chains of productions that trigger other genes in a complex regulatory network. Some of
these triggers are intracellular, such as one set of gene products resulting in expression of another
group of genes, while other products may inhibit certain expressions creating feedback loops and
several tiers of regulation. Some signaling pathways transduce extracellular signals that allow the
morphology to develop in response to particular properties of its extracellular environment. This
is in contrast to the representations discussed earlier, where the phenotype was completely deﬁned
by the genotype. Through these regulatory pathways, a genotype may encode a phenotype with
variations that can compensate, exploit, and be more adaptive to its target environment.
Bongard and Pfeifer (2003) explored a regulatory network representation for evolving both a
body and a brain of a robot. The machines were composed of spherical cells, which could each
contain several angular actuators, touch sensors, and angular sensor, as seen in Figure 4.7a. The
actuators and sensors were connected through a neural network as in Figure 4.1b, but the speciﬁc
connectivity of the network was determined by an evolved regulatory network. The regulatory
network contained genes which could sprout new connections and create new spherical cells, as
well as express or inhibit ‘‘chemical’’ signals that would propagate through the structure. These
chemical signals could also trigger the expression of other genes, giving rise to complex signaling
and feedback pathways. Some machines evolved in response to a ﬁtness rewarding the ability to
push a block forward are shown in Figure 4.7b. These machines grow until they reach the block and
have a ﬁrm grasp of the ground; their regulatory nature would allow them to attain a slightly dif-
ferent morphology if they would be growing in the presence of a slightly differently shaped block.
It is interesting to note that an analysis of the regulation pattern (who regulates who, Figure 4.7c)
shows that genes that regulate growth of neurons (colored red) and genes that regulate growth if new

cells (colored blue) are relatively separated, suggesting an initial emergence of what we call
‘‘body’’ and ‘‘brain.’’
4.5
EVOLVING MACHINES IN PHYSICAL REALITY
Though many robotic experiments are carried out in simulation, a robot must ultimately reside in
physical reality. Applying evolutionary processes to physical machines is difﬁcult for two reasons.
First, even if we are only evolving controllers for a ﬁxed machine, each evaluation of a candidate
controller involves trying it out in reality. This is a slow and costly process that also wears out
the target system. Performing thousand of evaluations is usually impractical. Second, if we are
evolving morphology as well, then how would these morphological changes take place in reality?
Changes to the controller can be done simply by reprogramming, but changes to the morphology
require more sophisticated processes. Nature has some interesting solutions to this problem, such
as growing materials, or self-assembling and self-replicating basic building blocks like cells. Let
us examine these two approaches.
4.5.1
Evolving Controllers for Physical Morphologies
One approach to evolving controllers for ﬁxed morphologies is to make a simulator that is so
perfect, that whatever works in simulation will work in reality equally well. Unfortunately, such a
Figure 4.7 (See color insert following page 302)

which contains neurons responsible for sensing (T ¼ touch, A ¼ angle) and motor actuation (M). The connectivity

expressed in response to chemicals in a regulatory network. (b) Three machines evolved to be able to push a block.

ation that suggests an emergence of a ‘‘body’’ and a ‘‘brain.’’ (From Bongard, J. C., Pfeifer, R. (2003) Evolving

Species (Designing Embodied Intelligence), Springer-Verlag, New York, New York. With permission.)

simulator has not yet been constructed. It is unlikely that one could be constructed, given the
chaotic nature of machine dynamics and their sensitivity to initial conditions and many small
parameter variations. Even if such simulators existed, creating accurate models would be pains-
takingly difﬁcult, or may be impossible if the target environment is not perfectly known.
An alternative approach to ‘‘crossing the reality gap’’ is to use a crude simulator that captures the
salient features of the search space. Techniques have been developed for creating such simulators
and using noise to cover uncertainties so that the evolved controllers do not exploit these uncer-
tainties (Jakobi, 1997). Yet another approach is to use plasticity in the controller: allow the robot to
learn and adapt in reality. In nature, animals are born with mostly predetermined bodies and brains,
but these have some ability to learn and make ﬁnal adaptations to whatever actual conditions may
arise.
A third approach is to coevolve simulators so that they are increasingly predictive. Just as we use
evolution to design a controller, we can use evolution to design the simulator so that it captures the
important properties of the target environment. Assume we have a rough simulator of the target
morphology, and we use it to evolve controllers in simulation. We then take the best controller and
try it — once — on the target system. If successful, we are done; but if the controller did not
produce the anticipated result (as is likely to happen since the initial simulator was crude), then we
observed some unexpected sensory data. We then evolve a new set of simulators, whose ﬁtness is
their ability to reproduce the actual observed behavior when the original controller is tested on
them. Simulators that correctly reproduce the observed data are more likely to be predictive in the
future. We then take the best simulator, and use it to evolve a new controller, and the cycle repeats.
If the controller works in reality, we are done. If it does not work as expected, we now have more
data to evolve better simulators, and so forth. The coevolution of controllers and simulators is not
necessarily computationally efﬁcient, but it dramatically reduces the number of trials necessary on
the target system.
The coevolutionary process consists of two phases: evolving the controller (or whatever we are
trying to modify on the target system) — we call this the exploration phase. The second phase tries
to create a simulator, or model of the system — we call this the estimation phase. To illustrate the
estimation–exploration process, consider a target robot with some unknown, but critical, morpho-
logical parameters, such as mass distribution and sensory lag times. Fifty independent runs of the
algorithm were conducted against the target robot. Figure 4.8a shows the 50 series of 20 best
simulator modiﬁcations output after each pass through the estimation phase. Figure 4.8a makes
clear that for all 50 runs, the algorithm was better able to infer the time lags of the eight sensors than
the mass increases of the nine body parts. This is not surprising in that the sensors themselves
provide feedback about the robot. In other words, the algorithm automatically, and after only a few
target trials, deduces the correct time lags of the target robot’s sensors, but is less successful at
indirectly inferring the masses of the body parts using the sensor data. Convergence towards the
correct mass distribution can also be observed, but even with an approximate description of
the robot’s mass distribution, the simulator is improved enough to allow smooth transfer of
controllers from simulation to the target robot. Using the default, approximate simulation, there
is a complete failure of transferal: the target robot simply moves randomly, and achieves no
appreciable forward locomotion. It is interesting to note that the evolved simulators are not perfect;
they capture well only those aspects of the world that are important for accomplishing the task.
The exploration–estimation approach can be used for much more than transferring controllers to
robots — it could be used by the robot itself to estimate its own structure. This would be particularly
useful if the robot may undergo some damage that changes some of its morphology in unexpected
ways, or some aspect in its environment changes. As each controller action is taken, the actual
sensory data is compared to that predicted by the simulator, and new internal simulators are evolved
to be more predictive. These new simulators are then used to try out new, adapted controllers for the
new and unexpected circumstances. Figure 4.8b shows some results applying this process to design
controllers for a robot which undergoes various types of drastic morphological damage, like losing

a leg, motor, or sensor, or combinations of these. In most cases, the estimation–exploration process
is able to reconstruct a new simulator that captures the actual damage using only 4 to 5 trials on the
target robot, and then use the adapted simulator to evolve compensatory controllers that recover
most of the original functionality. There are numerous applications to this identiﬁcation and control
process in other ﬁelds.
4.5.2
Making Morphological Changes in Hardware
An evolutionary process may require a change of morphology or production of a new physical
morphology altogether. One approach for generating new morphology is to use reconﬁgurable robots
(Yim et al., 2002). Reconﬁgurable robots are composed of many modules that can be connected,
disconnected, and rearranged in various topologies to create machines with variable body plans.
Self-reconﬁgurable robots are able to rearrange their own morphology, and thus adapt in physical
reality. Figure 4.9a shows one example of a self-reconﬁguring robot composed of eight identical
cubes (Zykov et al., 2005). Each cube can swivel around its (1,1,1) axis, and connect and disconnect
to other cubes using electromagnets on its faces. Though this robot contains only eight units, it is
conceivable that a future machine will be composed of hundreds and thousands of modules of smaller
scales, allowing much greater control and ﬂexibility in morphological change. As scales decrease,
one may need to switch from classical deterministic reconﬁguration processes to stochastic processes
that exploit Brownian motion, not mechanisms in the biological cell. Figure 4.9b shows some large
scale robot prototypes which operate on these stochastic principles (White et al., 2004).
An alternative approach to varying morphology is to produce the entire robot morphology
automatically. For example, the robots shown in Figure 4.4f were produced using rapid prototyp-
ing equipment: These are 3D printers, that deposit material layer by layer to gradually build up a
solid object of arbitrary geometry, as shown in Figure 4.9c. This ‘‘printer,’’ when coupled to an
evolutionary design process, can produce complex geometries that are difﬁcult to produce any other
way, and thus allow the evolutionary search much greater design ﬂexibility. Nevertheless, even
when using such automated fabrication equipment, we needed to manually insert the wires, logic,
batteries, and actuators. What if the printer could print these components too? Future rapid
prototyping systems may allow deposition of multiple integrated materials, such as elastomers,
conductive wires, batteries, and actuators, offering evolution an even larger design space of
integrated structures, actuators and sensors, not unlike biological tissue. Figure 4.9d shows some
of these printed components (Malone and Lipson, 2004).
4.6
THE ECONOMY OF DESIGN AUTOMATION
The examples shown so far are all related to design and fabrication of robotic systems, but the
principles described here are applicable in many other domains. Is there a way to know a´ priori
where these methods will be successful? Several decades of experience have shown that there are a
number of conditions that suggest such problem domains.
.
Known physics. Most evolutionary systems use some form of simulation to determine the conse-
quence of various design choices. Evolutionary algorithms are fruitful when the physics are
understood well enough that simulations are predictive, there is no question about the underlying
physical phenomena, and that simulation can be carried out in reasonable time.
.
Well-deﬁned search space. The basic ‘‘atomic’’ building blocks comprising potential solutions are
known, and it is clear how they are allowed to ﬁt together. These two aspects deﬁne a search space
in which the evolutionary algorithm can operate. Knowing the building blocks and interfaces does
not imply knowing the solution. It is important to realize that ‘‘building blocks’’ are not necessarily
discrete components — they can be features of a solution or partial solutions.
Evolutionary Robotics and Open-Ended Design Automation

.
Little formal design knowledge. Evolutionary algorithms are ‘‘knowledge sparse’’; they essentially
generate knowledge through search. They are thus able to work in the absence of formal knowledge
in the problem domain. Given enough time and resources, one may be able to design a specialized
algorithm that takes advantage of speciﬁc domain knowledge and outperforms an evolutionary
algorithm, but often this is time consuming, costly, and too difﬁcult.

.
An approximate solution will sufﬁce. Evolutionaryalgorithms do not provide guarantees on the solu-
tion optimality, and do not necessarily ﬁnd the optimal solution. In many practical problem domains,
we do not require strict optimality; a solution is good enough if it is better than the competition.
Computer scientists often compare algorithms on the basis of their computational efﬁciency —
how fast can the algorithm solve a problem. A second (often neglected) factor affecting
the usefulness of algorithms is their economy: How many resources do you need to invest in
designing and implementing an algorithm before it can produce useful results? Evaluating algo-
rithms based on performance alone is equivalent to pricing products without amortizing their
development costs. As the cost of development labor increases and the cost of computing power
decreases, we begin to favor algorithms that are easy to implement and require little formal
knowledge in the problem domain, even if they are computationally less efﬁcient. These trends
are becoming more pronounced as we venture into new scientiﬁc and engineering domains where
human intuition is poor.
Robotics is one area where these criteria are met: the physics are well understood, the building
blocks are well known, there is little formal design knowledge, and approximate solutions will
sufﬁce. There are many more examples, especially in emerging ﬁelds. A typical domain where
these criteria are met is micro-scale design. For example, microphotonics devices manipulate light
(like microelectronic devices manipulate electrons). Their function depends on manipulating
photons at the quantum level. The physics is well understood, as we can predict the behavior
of photons by solving Maxwell’s equations; the building blocks are well deﬁned, as we know
the capabilities of microfabrication tools; little design knowledge exists as few people have the
intuition to design structures that manipulate light at subwavelength scales; and approximate
solutions will sufﬁce as current solutions are suboptimal anyway. One notable challenge is
the design of regular (periodic) structures that conﬁne light, known as photonic crystals. Figure
4.10a shows a way of representing the geometry of photonic cells as a hierarchy of partitions.
Evolving cell representations and checking their ability to conﬁne light using a simulator produced
an interesting pattern shown in Figure 4.10b. This pattern outperforms human-designed patterns by

10% (bandgap size). It is interesting to note that similar skewed-hexagonal pattern also appears in
nature for the same purpose (Figure 4.10c). The number of domains where open-ended synthesis
algorithms are producing human-competitive designs is growing rapidly (Koza, 2003).
4.7
FUTURE CHALLENGES
Parametric evolutionary optimization has been successfully applied in almost every engineering
domain (e.g., Gen and Cheng, 1999; Zalzala and Fleming, 1999; Jamshidi et al., 2002; Karr and
Freeman, 1998; Mazumder and Rudnick, 1998), but the use of evolution for open-ended design will
likely have an even higher impact. It is also one of the most poorly understood areas of evolutionary
computation. We are seeking to understand what underlies the complexity limits of what can be
designed automatically, and what allows natural systems to evolve systems so much more advanced
than what we can evolve artiﬁcially. Is it simply a matter of computational power — that nature is
performing an immeasurable number of evaluations every second? Or is there something more
fundamental about the evolutionary process that we have failed to capture? What are the implica-
tions of physical embodiment and self-replication that we often bypass in our simulations? What
are the implications of external ﬁtness measures that we impose on the system, and of arbitrary
inductive biases we introduce thorough our choices of atomic building blocks and representations?
Does complexity require complex ecosystem with coevolution, symbiosis, competition, and co-
operation? Can we outperform natural evolution by using analytical shortcuts through its weak
statistical processes?
These are long standing problems that are not unique to evolutionary computation. The question
of how complex systems are synthesized is fundamental from three perspectives: AI research
interested in automating discovery processes, engineering research in understanding the design
process, and biology research interested in the origin of complexity. These perspectives are
captured well in the following statments:
One may wonder, [ . . . ] how complex organisms evolve at all. They seem to have so many genes, so
many multiple or pleiotropic effects of any one gene, so many possibilities for lethal mutations in early
development, and all sorts of problems due to their long development.
(Bonner, J. T., (1988) The Evolution of Complexity, p. 173.)
Today more and more design problems are reaching insoluble levels of complexity . . . these problems
have a background of needs and activities which is becoming too complex to grasp intuitively . . . The
intuitive resolution of contemporary design problems simply lies beyond a single individual’s integra-
tive grasp.
(Alexander, C. A., Notes on the Synthesis of Form, 1964, pp. 3–5.)
I believe that scalability of open-ended evolutionary processes depends on their ability to exploit
functional modularity, structural regularity, and hierarchy (Lipson, 2004). Functional modularity
creates a separation of function into structural units, thereby reducing the amount of coupling
between internal and external behavior on those units and allowing evolution to reuse them as
higher-level building blocks. Structural regularity is the correlation of patterns within an individual.
Examples of regularity are repetition of units, symmetries, self-similarities, smoothness, and any
other form of reduced information content. Regularity allows evolution to specify increasingly
extensive structures while maintaining short description lengths. Hierarchy is the recursive com-
position of function and structure into increasingly larger and adapted units, allowing evolution to
search efﬁciently increasingly complex spaces.
The existence of modular, regular, and hierarchical architectures in naturally evolved systems
is well established (Wagner and Altenberg, 1996; Hartwell et al., 1999). Though evolutionary
processes have been studied predominantly in biological contexts, they exist in many other
150
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

domains, such as language, culture, social organization, and technology (Basalla, 1989; Ziman,
2003), among many others. Principles of modularity, regularity, and hierarchy are, however,
nowhere as dominant as they are in engineering design. Tracing the evolution of technology over
generations of products, one can observe numerous instances of designs being encapsulated into
modules, and those modules being used as standard higher-level building blocks elsewhere.
Similarly, there is a pressure to reduce the information content in designs, by repeating or
reusing the same modules where possible, using symmetrical and regular structures, and stand-
ardizing on components and dimensions. These and other forms of regularity translate into
reduced design, fabrication, and operation costs. The organization of engineering designs,
especially as complexity increases, is typically hierarchical. The hierarchy is often organized
such that the amount of information is distributed uniformly across levels, maintaining a
‘‘manageable’’ extent of information at each stage. These principles of modularity, regularity,
and hierarchy are cornerstones of engineering design theory and practice (e.g., Suh, 1990).
Though these principles are well established, there is — like biological evolution — still a
lack of a formal understanding of how and why modular, regular, and hierarchical structures
emerge and persist, and how can we computationally emulate these successful principles in the
design automation processes.
.
Functional modularity is the structural localization of function.
In order to measure functional modularity, one must have a quantitative deﬁnition of function and
structure. It is then possible to take an arbitrary chunk of a system and measure the dependency of
the system function on elements of that chunk. The more that the dependency itself depends on
elements outside the chunk, the less the function of that chunk is localized, and hence the less
modular it is. If we represent dependencies as second derivatives of function with respect to pairs of
parameters (i.e., the Hessian matrix of the ﬁtness), then modules will be collections of parameters
that can be arranged with lighter off-diagonal elements (Wyatt and Lipson, 2003).
.
Structural regularity is the compressibility of the description of the structure.
The more the structure contains repetitions, near-repetitions, symmetries, smoothness, self-
similarities, etc., the shorter its description length will be. The amount of regularity can thus be
quantiﬁed as the inverse of the description length or of its Kolmogorov complexity.
.
Hierarchy of a system is the recursive composition of structure and/or function.
The amount of hierarchy can be quantiﬁed given the connectivity of functional or structural
elements (e.g., as a connectivity graph). The more the distribution of connectivities path
lengths among pairs of elements approximates a power law distribution, the more hierarchical
the system is.
4.7.1
Principles of Design
Modularity and regularity are independent principles. Principles of modularity and regularity are
often confused in the literature through the notion of reuse. Indeed, modularity has several
advantages, one of which is that modules can be used as building blocks at higher levels, and
therefore can be repeated. Nonetheless, it is easy to imagine a system that is composed of modules,
where each module appears only once. For example, opening the hood of a car reveals a system
composed of a single engine, a single carburetor, and a single transmission. Each of these units
appears only once (i.e., is not reused anywhere else in the system), but can be considered a module
as its function is localized. Its evolutionary advantage is that it can be adapted more independently,
with less impact of the adaptation on the context. A carburetor may be swapped to a newer
technology without affecting the rest of the engine system.
Similarly, there are instances of regularity without modularity. The smoothness of the hood of
the car, for example, reduces the information content of the structure but does not involve the reuse
of a particular module.
Evolutionary Robotics and Open-Ended Design Automation
151

Though these principles are independent, they often appear in tandem and hence the confusion:
we tend to speak of useful modules being reused as building blocks, and indeed recurrence of a
pattern may be an indication of its functional modularity, though not a proof of it.
An inherent tradeoff exists between modularity and regularity through the notion of coupling.
Modularity by deﬁnition reduces coupling, as it involves the localization of function. Regularity,
however, increases coupling as it reduces information content. For example, if a module is reused in
two different contexts, then the information content of the system has reduced (the module needs to
be described only once and then repeated), but any change to the module will have an effect on both
places. Software engineers are well aware of this tradeoff. As a function is encapsulated and called
from an increasing number of different contexts in a program, so does modifying it become
increasingly difﬁcult because it is entangled in so many different functions.
The tradeoff between modularity and reuse is also observed in engineering as the tradeoff
between modularity and optimality. Modularity often comes at the expense of optimal perform-
ance. Systems that are less modular, that is more integrated, can be more efﬁcient in their
performance as information, energy, and materials can be passed directly within the system, at
the expense of increased coupling. Software engineers are familiar with ‘‘long jumps’’ and ‘‘global
variables’’ that have this effect, similarly, mechanical products will often achieve optimality of
performance or cost through integration of parts into monolithic components wherever possible.
The increased performance gained by reduction of modularity is often justiﬁed in the short term,
whereas increased modularity is often justiﬁed in longer time scales where adaptation becomes a
dominant consideration.
It is not clear whether modularity, regularity, and hierarchy are properties of the system being
evolved (i.e., the ‘‘solution’’), or of the target ﬁtness speciﬁcation (i.e., the ‘‘problem’’). It may well
be that there is a duality between these viewpoints. The evolutionary computation literature
contains several instances of test functions that are themselves modular (separable, e.g., Royal
Roads [Mitchell, 1996]), hierarchical (e.g., Hierarchical-IFF [Watson and Pollack, 1999]), and
regular (e.g., one-max). It is not surprising then to see corresponding algorithms that are able to
exploit these properties and ﬁnd the solutions to these problems.
Engineers often go to great lengths to describe design goals in a way that is solution-neutral,
that is it describes target functionality while placing the least constraints on the solution. Indeed
engineering design is notorious for having multiple — even many — solutions to any given
problem, without any solution being clearly superior. The fact that modular, regular, and hierarch-
ical solutions are more attractive is because — we conjecture — the design process itself tends
to prefer those for reasons of scalability. It is therefore plausible that in search of scalable
algorithms for synthesizing solutions bottom up, we should avoid test functions that have an
inherent modular or hierarchical reward, and have these solution properties emerge from the search
process itself.
4.7.2
Research Methodology
Though robotic systems provide an intuitive and appealing substrate to explore many of these
questions, they also pose many difﬁculties. They are computationally expensive to simulate and
difﬁcult to construct physically. More importantly, like biology, they contain many beautifully
complex but arbitrary details that obscure the universal principles that we are looking for. There
is always a temptation to increase the ﬁdelity of the simulators, adding more biologically
realistic details, in hopes that this would lead to more life-like behaviors. However, it is sometimes
more fruitful to investigate these questions in a simpler, more transparent substrate. In fact we look
for the minimal substrate that still exhibits the effects we are investigating. Many insights can be
gained by looking at these simpliﬁed systems, and the lessons learned brought to bear on the
complex problems of practical importance. Thus much of the research in evolutionary design and
evolutionary robotics is disguised as experiments in much more abstract systems.

CONCLUSIONS
We have followed through a number of cases where principles of biological evolution have been
used to automate the design of machines — from relatively simple examples in controller design to
design and fabrication of complete functional machines in physical reality, sometimes outperform-
ing the human designs. Unlike other forms of biomimicry, however, we are not seeking to imitate
the solutions that present themselves in nature — like the gecko’s feet, a bird’s wing, or a human’s
muscle — because these solutions were optimized for very speciﬁc needs and circumstances that
may not reﬂect our requirements and unique capabilities. Instead, we chose to imitate the process
that led to these solutions, as biology’s design process has shown time and again its ability to
discover new opportunities.
It is clear that the complexity of engineering products is increasing to the point where traditional
design processes are reaching their limits. More manpower is being invested in managing
and maintaining large systems than designing them, and this ratio is likely to increase because
no single person can fathom the complexities involved. Alexander’s quote (above) is truer today than
it was in the 1960s. Engineering and science are moving into scales and dimensions where people
have little or no intuitions and the complexities involved are overwhelming. One way out of this
conundrum is to design machines that can design for us — this is the future of engineering.

INTRODUCTION
Optimization problems are deﬁned by an objective function. The objective function is a
dependent variable, i.e., it is a function of several independent variables. The objective is to ﬁnd
the best combination of the independent variables such that the objective function is either
minimized or maximized (for clarity of the discussion we assume in this chapter that the problem
is minimization). Typically, the objective function is subject to a set of constraints that must
be satisﬁed.
157

Some optimization models are based on continuous variables (linear or nonlinear program-
ming), that is the variables are allowed to obtain any value (whether integer or fractional). Other
optimization models require integer variables, that is variables that must be whole numbers 0, 1,
2, . . . (integer programming, Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1988). Other models require 0 or 1 variables,
that is variables that must be binary, which can assume either a value of 0 or a 1 (such as ‘‘yes’’ or
‘‘no,’’ build or not build, select or not select). For such 0 or 1 (sometimes called Boolean)
programming problems, there is a ﬁnite number of combinations. For example, 10 binary variables
can have 210 ¼ 1,024 combinations that can usually be evaluated within a reasonable computer
time. Theoretically, one can calculate the value of the objective function for all possible combin-
ations of the independent variables and select the best combination (such a process is called total
enumeration). However, the number of possible combinations is often prohibitively large, as it will
take thousands of years to evaluate all of them making it nontractable. For 100 binary variables, the
number of possible combinations is 2100 ¼ 1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376 which
will take over 40,000 trillion years to evaluate even if the evaluation of each combination takes one
millionth of a second.
For instance, consider the location of instruments such as cellular telephone transmitters
(towers) to cover 1000 sites. There are 100 candidate locations (a preselected set) for placing the
instruments. For each candidate location, there is a subset of the 1000 sites that are covered by it.
The objective is to ﬁnd the minimum number of instruments required to cover all 1000 sites. This
is the set covering problem (Daskin, 1995; Current et al., 2002). Alternatively, one may wish to
maximize the number of covered sites with a given number of instruments (the maximum cover
problem, Daskin, 1995; Current et al., 2002). The latter objective is appropriate when there is a
limited budget (a constraint). The variables are assigned a value of ‘‘0’’ if the candidate location is
not selected and ‘‘1’’ if it is selected. Each possible combination is described by a vector of 100
zeroes and ones. If one needs to check all possible subsets of the candidate locations, one has to
check 2100 combinations, which is prohibitive (see above).
In cases where total enumeration is impractical, various optimization techniques have been
developed. One approach for ﬁnding the optimal solution is the branch and bound approach (Land
and Doig, 1960; Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1988). The branch and bound approach implicitly
evaluates all possibilities, but a bound is used to eliminate the need to evaluate all of them. The
number of remaining combinations is signiﬁcantly reduced thereby making it possible to evaluate
them in a reasonable computer time.
When robust approaches (that guarantee ﬁnding the optimal solution) are not efﬁcient enough to
be performed in a reasonable computer time, heuristic algorithms are used. Heuristic algorithms are
designed to ﬁnd a ‘‘good’’ solution but do not guarantee that the optimal solution is found. In the last
three decades, researchers have developed ‘‘metaheuristic’’ methods (Salhi, 1998) that are problem-
independent general heuristic approaches to be applied in any optimization problem.
Following a brief overview of major metaheuristic approaches, we will focus on genetic
algorithms, also referred to as evolutionary algorithms.
It is interesting to note that many of these metaheuristic methods mimic biological and other
natural processes, most notably genetic algorithms mimic evolutionary processes, natural selection,
and survival of the ﬁttest.
5.1.1
Common Metaheuristic Methods
1.
Steepest descent is the ‘‘classic’’ local search for a minimum. A ‘‘neighborhood’’ of nearby
combinations is deﬁned for each particular combination. The number of combinations in the
neighborhood is usually quite small. The algorithm starts at one (usually constructed randomly)
combination and proceeds iteratively. At each iteration, (i) all combinations in the neighborhood are
evaluated, and (ii) if a better combination is found, the search moves to the best combination in
the neighborhood and the iteration is completed. The next iteration applies the same process to the
158
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

newly elected combination (i.e., evaluating all combinations in the new neighborhood, etc.). The
algorithm terminates when there is no better combination in the neighborhood.
2.
Tabu search (Glover, 1986; Glover and Laguna, 1997) is based on artiﬁcial intelligence. The search
starts as a steepest descent algorithm but continues after the steepest descent algorithm has been
terminated. Unlike the steepest descent, tabu search may take upward moves in the hope that a
sequence of upward moves will lead to a better downward move and eventually to a better solution.
The direction of the search is determined by the recent history of moves that are ‘‘memorized.’’
Once a move is performed, the reverse move (i.e., moving back to the previous combination) is
forbidden for some iterations (hence the name tabu which can also be spelled taboo), thus pushing
the search away from previous combinations. Imagine a search on a plane with many craters. One
of these craters is the deepest one, and that one is the desired solution (the global optimum). The
steepest descent performs only downward moves and may land at a shallow crater (a local optimum)
and not at the global one. Tabu search attempts to get out of a shallow crater in the hope of getting
into a better one. Therefore, when the steepest descent algorithm terminates at a bottom of a crater,
upward moves are taken in tabu search while sliding back into the same crater is disallowed with the
hope of sliding into deeper craters and eventually reaching the global optimum.
3.
Simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983) simulates the annealing of metals from a very hot
liquid phase to a cool solid phase. Borrowing the metaphor of the plane full of craters, simulated
annealing is like a ‘‘bouncing’’ rubber ball which we hope will settle at the deepest crater because
it is more difﬁcult to get out of it. The cooling of the temperature means that the ‘‘height’’ of the
bounce diminishes as the process continues.
4.
The ant colonies metaheuristic (Colorni et al., 1992; Dorigo and Gambardella, 1997; Gambardella
et al., 1999) is based on the behavior of ants when they ﬁnd a food source (the optimal solution).
Ants return to their nest discharging pheromone. Other ants follow the pheromone and eventually
form a line leading to the food source. The premise of the algorithm is that more pheromone will be
discharged on the way to the food source than on the way to other points in the plane.
5.
Genetic algorithms (Holland, 1975; Goldberg, 1989; Reeves, 1993) simulate evolution and survival
of the ﬁttest (attributed to Charles Darwin even though Alfred Russell Wallace discovered it ﬁrst).
A population (made of individual combinations) evolves over time (generations). Pairs of popula-
tion members (combinations) mate and produce an offspring (two combinations are merged to
produce a new combination — details below). Good offspring are kept in the population whereas
unﬁt population members are discarded (the survival of the ﬁttest). The population evolves, and at
the end of the process, the population usually consists of fairly good solutions (without a guarantee
that the optimal solution is found). Details of genetic algorithms follow.
5.2
THE FRAMEWORK OF GENETIC ALGORITHMS
In nature, while two dandelions or two squirrels may look the same to us, no two individuals of any
species are identical (including human identical twins, Segal, 2000); some are larger, some healthier,
some faster, some more aggressive in behavior, and the number of traits that distinguish individuals is
seemingly limitless. In any environment, some traits are naturally selected, making an individual
more ﬁt, thus able to live longer and produceviable offspring. The ﬁttest individuals will thus produce
more offspring than the less ﬁt, and thus certain traits are naturally selected in any population over
time. A well-known example is that of the peppered moth in England during the industrial revolution.
This moth is light colored with black spots (hence its name), and rests on lichen-covered trees of the
same coloring. Birds prey upon the moth, therefore good camouﬂage is critical for survival as those
individuals that stand out arequickly spotted and eaten. With theindustrial revolution and the burning
of coal, the trees became dark in color from the release of pollutants into the air. Those moths that
were slightly darker in color, survived more successfully than the slightly lighter colored individuals.
Thus in this case, ‘‘ﬁtness’’ was related to the ability of an individual to blend with the environment,
that is coloring (among other traits). The darker colored moths had higher survival rates and
lived longer, and as a result produced more offspring. Thus the next generation was, on average,
relatively darker in color. After several generations, most of the peppered moths were dark in the
Genetic Algorithms in Optimization Models
159

cities while remaining lighter in rural England. The darker color was ‘‘naturally selected’’ in urban
populations. Since the passage of the Clean Air Act and the resulting reduction of coal burning,
numbers of light colored moths are now increasing in England’s industrial towns.
There are many differences between natural processes and genetic algorithms. In nature, ﬁtness
varies across species, across space, and over time. The ﬁttest individuals of a particular species
18,000 years ago during the last ice age changed as climate warmed and the environment changed,
and as different species’ ranges shifted with the warming climate. In a sense, ‘‘ﬁtness’’ is a moving
target in nature. However, in genetic algorithms the ﬁt function is well deﬁned and does not change
over time.
Another major difference between natural evolution and genetic algorithms is that in nature
there is interaction between different species while none exists in genetic algorithms. In the moth
case, if there is an increase in the bird population, more moths are eaten. In nature, an important
measure of ﬁtness relates to survival from predators. In genetic algorithms, there is only one deﬁned
‘‘species’’ and the evolution occurs in a vacuum.
In genetic algorithms, when two combinations are compared, a mechanism for determining
which one is ‘‘better’’ is needed. This criterion is called the ‘‘ﬁt function’’ named after the concept
of the survival of the ﬁttest in nature. Typically, this ﬁt function is the objective function. The
general framework of genetic algorithms is an evolving population of selected combinations.
A starting population (typically randomly generated) of combinations is established. Each gener-
ation follows a sequence of steps:
1.
Two population members are selected as parents. In most algorithms the two parents are randomly
selected but the selection may be governed by some other rule.
2.
The two parents are ‘‘merged’’ (mate) and produce an offspring. A successful merging process for
producing an offspring is probably the most important feature of a genetic algorithm.
3.
The population is updated. Some offspring are added to the population as some members are
removed. The rules by which offspring are added to the population and population members
‘‘die’’ also affect the effectiveness of the algorithm.
The process continues for a prespeciﬁed number of generations and the best member of the ﬁnal
population is the result of the algorithm.
5.3
MODIFICATIONS OF THE GENETIC ALGORITHM FRAMEWORK
Over the years a variety of modiﬁcations have been proposed to the basic genetic algorithm
described above. It remains essential to design a good merging process for a successful genetic
algorithm. Once a satisfactory merging process is designed, these modiﬁcations may improve even
a good genetic algorithm.
Typically, as the population evolves, the genetic diversity among members declines and the
population becomes more homogeneous. This is because a ‘‘good’’ trait tends to remain in the
population and is transferred to new offspring who are more likely to join the population. ‘‘Bad’’
traits tend to disappear from the population because offspring with bad traits are less likely to
survive and join the population, and if they do join the population, they are more likely to be
discarded from it later in the evolutionary process. Most proposed modiﬁcations tend to increase
genetic diversity among population members thereby slow down the convergence of the population
to similar members. Increasing genetic diversity slows down the convergence as it increases the
chance to obtain the global optimum. If one of the necessary traits required for the global optimum
is missing from the population, the global optimum will be missed. Higher diversity increases the
probability that all necessary traits do exist in the population gene pool (possibly in different
members, though). If all traits exist in the gene pool, the combination that is needed for creating
the global optimum is more likely to be obtained by mating the ‘‘right’’ parents. On the other hand,
160
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

early convergence to a homogeneous population increases the probability that a necessary trait (for
the global optimum) will disappear from the population and the algorithm will terminate in a local
optimum rather than in the global one.
One simple way to retain greater genetic diversity is not to add to the population an offspring
that is identical to an existing population member. Even though it is rare to get two identical
combinations, if it happens and the two identical population members are selected as parents, they
will generate an identical offspring and before long all population members will be identical to this
member. If it is the best population member, it may be at the bottom of a ‘‘shallow’’ crater. If it is
not the best population member, the population may evolve into one with many identical members
and only a few better ones. The probability of generating better members under such circumstances
is signiﬁcantly reduced, and the population may become stagnant.
The modiﬁcations listed below attempt to improve some aspects of the genetic algorithm. All
are rooted in biological or evolutionary processes:
1.
The existence of different populations with movements between them (Parallel Genetic Algorithms
[PGA], Cantu-Paz, 1998).
2.
Improving the creation of the starting population (compounded genetic, Drezner, 2005a).
3.
Improving the newly generated offspring by using a local search such as a descent algorithm or tabu
search. The combination of a local search with a genetic algorithm is called a hybrid genetic
algorithm or a memetic algorithm (Moscato, 2002).
4.
The introduction of mutations that affect the newly generated offspring (Spears, 2000).
5.
Invasions of ‘‘foreign’’ combinations that affect the population (Goldberg, 1989).
6.
Improving parent selection procedures by assigning two genders to population members (Drezner
and Drezner, 2005) or distance-based selection (Drezner and Marcoulides, 2003).
7.
Improving the selection criteria for the removal of population members (Drezner, 2005b).
These modiﬁcations are discussed in detail below.
5.3.1
Parallel Genetic Algorithms
PGA allow for parallel populations of the same species with movements between them. They are
especially suited for parallel computing. Parallel GAs are easy to implement and they have great
potential for substantial improvement in search performance. For a review of PGA, see Cantu-Paz
(1998) and Cantu-Paz and Goldberg (2000).
Multiple-population GAs are more sophisticated, as they consist of several subpopulations
which occasionally are allowed to exchange individuals (movement). This exchange of individuals
is controlled by several parameters (Cantu-Paz, 1999):
.
Movement rate determines how many individuals leave a population.
.
Movement frequency (movement interval) determines how often a move occurs.
.
Movement topology determines the destination of the move.
.
Movement policy determines which individuals move (and are added) and which are replaced at the
receiving population.
Multiple-population PGA are known by different names. Sometimes they are known as ‘‘dis-
tributed’’ GAs, because they are usually implemented in distributed-memory Multiple Instruction
or Multiple Data (MIMD) computers. Since the computation to communication ratio can be
relatively high, they are occasionally called coarse-grained GAs.
5.3.2
Compounded Genetic Algorithms
The compounded genetic algorithm (Drezner, 2005a) is similar to the PGA. The difference is that in
the compounded genetic algorithm there is no movement between the isolated populations. Genetic
Genetic Algorithms in Optimization Models
161

algorithms are applied in two phases, generating the starting population for phase 2 by repeating
genetic algorithms in phase 1. This mimics evolving parallel populations at several isolated
locations. The best species in each location are moved to a common location thus creating a
‘‘high quality’’ starting population. Suppose that a population of P members is applied in phase 2.
Genetic algorithms are run K times in phase 1 using K randomly generated starting populations (it is
convenient but not necessary to have integer P/K). The population size of the phase 1 genetic
algorithm should be at least P/K. The best P/K population members of each run are compiled to
construct the starting population for phase 2. Phase 2 genetic algorithm is run once. It is recom-
mended that a ‘‘quick’’ genetic algorithm is used for phase 1 and an ‘‘effective’’ and possibly
‘‘slow’’ genetic algorithm is used for phase 2.
For example, if a population of P ¼ 100 members is required for phase 2, phase 1 is run K ¼ 20
times (each with a population of at least ﬁve members), the best P/K ¼ 5 population members are
selected from each run and compiled to create a starting population for phase 2.
Note that the best solution found in phase 1 by any of the runs can only be improved by the
compounded genetic algorithm because the best solution found during phase 1 is a member of the
starting population of phase 2 and can only be removed from the population by better solutions.
5.3.3
Hybrid Genetic Algorithms
Hybrid genetic algorithms (also referred to as memetic algorithms, Moscato, 2002) employ an
improvement algorithm on the newly established offspring before considering it for inclusion in the
population. This is analogous to training the offspring to improve its ﬁtness just like training dogs to
follow orders or teaching pupils in order to enhance their knowledge. One may apply a steepest
descent or a tabu search procedure on every offspring before considering it for inclusion in the
population. Even a simple approach may ‘‘correct’’ a few traits in the offspring and provide an
improved solution. The hybrid modiﬁcation tends to accelerate the convergence of the population
because offspring tend to be more similar to one another.
Since such an improvement algorithm can be time consuming, one has to balance the beneﬁt of
employing an improvement algorithm against the time required to do it.
5.3.4
Mutations
Mutations in the formation of offspring occur quite frequently in nature. Most mutations are not
beneﬁcial to the species and can, in fact, be rather harmful. However, on rare occasions, a mutation
is beneﬁcial to the species and improves the offspring. It can be argued that evolution could not
have succeeded without mutations. Mutations may create new beneﬁcial traits that did not exist
before. If a trait is beneﬁcial to the species, the offspring will be ‘‘more ﬁt,’’ will be more likely to
produce better offspring, and will stay in the population longer.
The common way to apply mutations (Spears, 2000) is to occasionally (e.g., 10% of the time, a
parameter of the approach) introduce, by randomly selecting, a new gene in the newly created
offspring (by changing its value).
5.3.5
Invasions
Throughout the history of mankind, invasion of foreign tribes has been quite common, that is ‘‘the
Barbarian invasions.’’ Such invasions increase the gene pool of the local tribe and may lead to a
more advanced population. Following this phenomenon some researchers (Goldberg, 1989) suggest
that occasionally, new randomly generated combinations are added to the population, replacing
below average population members, mimicking an invasion. This ‘‘new blood’’ may generate better
and improved offspring and may introduce new traits that are not found in the population (the local
tribe). Such invasions tend to enhance the genetic diversity of the population with the positive
162
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

effect genetic diversity has on evolution. Some researchers refer to this modiﬁcation as injection.
Salhi and Gamal (2003) propose to inject into the population once in a while a few chromosomes,
which are either randomly generated or obtained from another heuristic. The injection rate is not
necessarily constant but can slightly decrease with the number of generations.
Invasion is also common in nature in the distribution of plants and animals. In such cases,
competition for resources ensues. This competition with the invading species may signal the
extinction of the native species if they are less ﬁt.
5.3.6
Gender
In nature, most advanced species require two genders in order to mate and reproduce. The gender
modiﬁcation attempts to mimic this natural process. One can argue that the division into two
genders was selected over time as the preferred way for producing offspring and is therefore
superior to other possible mating schemes. In gender-speciﬁc genetic algorithms, the diversity of
the population is better maintained with no detrimental effects on run time.
It is easy to ‘‘convert’’ a given genetic algorithm to a gender-speciﬁc one. Three minor
modiﬁcations are suggested (Drezner and Drezner, 2005):
1.
When the starting population is generated, half the population members are designated as males and
half are designated as females. The assignment of gender is done at random and no characteristic of
the population member is used for such determination.
2.
When selecting two parents, the ﬁrst parent is randomly selected while the second is randomly
selected from the pool of the opposite gender.
3.
When an offspring is generated, it is randomly assigned a gender with a 50% probability of being
assigned a male gender and 50% probability a female. Again, no characteristic of the offspring
should be used to determine its gender.
No extra effort is required for the implementation of the gender-speciﬁc modiﬁcation. A vector
of genders for population members needs to be maintained, along with the gender determined for
each offspring. In Drezner and Drezner (2005) it has been statistically shown that the gender-
speciﬁc algorithm signiﬁcantly improves the solutions on four sets of problems.
Note that it is important that an offspring’s gender is randomly determined. An early attempt
(Allenson, 1992) for the gender line a modiﬁcation failed because it was suggested that the
offspring is assigned the gender of the discarded population member. The rationale for his rule is
to keep the population half males and half females. But this rule is inconsistent with nature. The
concern is that if the population becomes all males or all females no further evolution is possible.
The evolutionary process must be terminated prematurely if such a population structure evolves. In
Drezner and Drezner (2005), it is shown that for a sufﬁciently large population (50 or more
members), the probability that all population members will have the same gender is extremely
low and can be ignored.
5.3.7
Distance-Based Parent Selection
All human cultures prohibit marriage between siblings or between parents and children (genetically
similar pairs). In societies where marriages are arranged, similarity in socio-economic standing, but
not genetic make-up, is prevalent. Some plants avoid pollination from genetically similar or
identical individuals because self-pollination or pollination by ‘‘siblings’’ is typically unsuccessful,
a phenomenon referred to in biology as ‘‘inbreeding depression.’’ Mating between close relatives
often results in less ﬁt offspring. Another, less well known biological fact, is that mating between
genetically distant members of the same species can lead to a decline in offspring ﬁtness, a
condition known as ‘‘outbreeding depression’’ or ‘‘hybrid breakdown.’’ Some species avoid pol-
lination from individuals that are geographically distant or genetically dissimilar, as offspring
Genetic Algorithms in Optimization Models
163

may be less suited to the local conditions and may be poorer competitors locally. Edmands (1999,
2002) observed that parental divergence (parents who are genetically distant) leads to less ﬁt
offspring.
In genetic algorithms, if dissimilar individuals mate, the offspring is more genetically diverse
which is critical in maintaining a population’s genetic diversity. However, parents who are too
dissimilar produce less ﬁt offspring. Using the distance criterion for parent selection, Drezner and
Marcoulides (2003) crafted a rule attempting to ﬁnd dissimilar but not too distant parents.
A parameter K ¼ 1, 2, 3, . . . is used. The ﬁrst parent is randomly selected and K candidates for
mating are then randomly selected. The distance (number of variables with different values, the
Hamming distance metric) between the ﬁrst parent and all candidate mates is calculated. The
farthest mate among these K candidates is selected as the second parent. Note that K ¼ 1 is
the ‘‘standard’’ parent selection. Drezner and Marcoulides (2003) found that the efﬁciency of the
modiﬁcation for a set of test problems peaks for K ¼ 2,3. Selecting the farthest population member
as a mate does not work well. It was also found that run time increases with K which further reduces
the appeal of larger Ks.
5.3.8
Removal of Population Members
In most standard genetic algorithms, when an offspring is generated, it is compared with the worst
population member, and if the offspring is better than the worst population member, it replaces
it. Some genetic algorithms employ a rule according to which if the offspring is identical to an
existing population member, it is not considered for inclusion in the population. This precludes the
possibility of having two identical population members.
Drezner (2005c) suggested a different rule for the removal of population members. Two rules
for the removal of a population member, once a better offspring (who is not identical to an existing
population member) is found, are used. Rule 1 is the standard approach and Rule 2 is a new one.
Rule 1: Remove the worst population member.
Rule 2: Distances between all pairs of population members are calculated. Suppose that the shortest
distance among all pairs of population members is d. All existing population members who are at
distance d from another population member form a subset. This subset must have at least two members
(at least one pair of population members are at distance d from one another). Remove the worst
population member in this subset.
In the experiments performed in Drezner (2005c), it was found that Rule 2 is not necessarily
better than Rule 1. The suggested rule is to select Rule 2 with probability p, and to select Rule 1
otherwise. Note that p ¼ 0 is the standard rule (Rule 1), and p ¼ 1 is Rule 2. The mix between the
two rules by selecting 0 < p < 1 seems to work well.
5.4
AN ILLUSTRATION
Three facilities (such as post ofﬁce branches) are to be constructed to serve 20 communities. For
simplicity, we assume that the communities have the same number of residents. Of the 20
communities, seven communities can house a branch and 13 communities cannot (for various
reasons). See Figure 5.1, where communities that can house a branch are denoted by black
circles and the rest by empty circles. Table 5.1 gives the x–y coordinates of the seven potential
facilities. Distances are straight-line (Euclidean) distances. Each community is served by the
closest branch. The objective is to locate the three branches so as to minimize the sum of
the service distances to all 20 communities thus providing the best overall service to all residents.
This problem is a p-median problem. For a discussion of p-median problems, see Current
et al. (2002).
164
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

This particular problem is very simple. There are only 35 possible combinations for
selecting three communities out of seven and thus total enumeration is straightforward. We
list all possible combinations in Table 5.2. A ‘‘1’’ indicates a community selected for a branch
and ‘‘0’’ indicates that it is not. To simplify the illustration, we calculate the objective function
values using an Excel spreadsheet. These values are depicted in the last column of Table 5.2. Since
the objective is the minimization of the sum of service distances to all communities, total
enumeration will ﬁnd that the optimal solution is combination #27 (communities #1, #3, and #7,
see Figure 5.1) with a total service distance of 31.01. To illustrate the genetic algorithm, we
‘‘pretend’’ that the optimal solution is not known and whenever the value of the ﬁt function
(objective function) is needed, it is calculated for that combination.

The p-median problem is well researched in the literature. Various optimization techniques
have been developed for its solution (see Daskin, 1995; Current et al., 2002). Typically, it is
formulated as integer programming (Daskin, 1995; Current et al., 2002). We present here a
different, intuitive formulation. Suppose that x ¼ {x1, x2, . . . , x7} are seven binary variables.
A variable is assigned a value of ‘‘1,’’ if the corresponding community is selected for a branch and
‘‘0,’’ if it is not. The set I is deﬁned to include all variables with a value of ‘‘1.’’ For a feasible
(acceptable) solution, the set I must be of cardinality 3. The service distance for community j is
deﬁned as dj ¼ min

5.4.1
The Genetic Algorithm Process
For the illustrative genetic algorithm problem (post ofﬁce branches), we selected the following
parameters. We maintain a population of ﬁve members. The parents are randomly selected to
produce an offspring. An offspring replaces the worst population member if (a) it is better than the
worst population member and (b) it is not identical to an existing population member. The merging
rule is as follows: the two parents are compared and all variables (genes) common to both retain this
common value. For the variables with different values (one parent has a ‘‘0’’ and the other has a
‘‘1’’), we randomly select the necessary number of ‘‘1’’s to bring the total number of ‘‘1’’s to 3.
Thus, the offspring satisﬁes Equations (5.2) and (5.3). For example, the two parents are 1001001
and 0111000. We ﬁrst determine the common genes creating 0111001
1001000 )***100*, where an asterisk
denotes an undetermined value which may be either ‘‘0’’ or ‘‘1.’’ Two ‘‘1’’s out of the four ‘‘*’’s are
randomly selected, while the rest get a ‘‘0.’’ The ﬁrst two stars were randomly selected as ‘‘1’’s, and
the offspring is therefore 1101000. Its value of the ﬁt function is calculated by Equation (5.1). This
process closely simulates nature with one exception. In the algorithm, if both parents have the same
trait for a speciﬁc gene, it is passed on to the offspring. If they have different traits, one of them
is randomly selected for the offspring. In nature, half of each chromosome is passed on to the
offspring. Also, there are dominant and recessive genes that determine the trait of the offspring.
The step-by-step description of the illustrative genetic algorithm is as follows.
1.
Randomly construct ﬁve different combinations to form the starting population (we employ a
population of ﬁve members). Next to each member is its value of the objective function calculated
by Equation (5.1). Since there are only 35 possible combinations we can construct them all and take
the ﬁt function values from Table 5.2. Typically, such a table cannot be constructed and the ﬁt
function is calculated for each combination separately. The random starting population is:
2.
Generation 1: the second and fourth combinations are randomly selected. The merge is:
0010110
0101100 ) 010 ) 0011100. The objective value is 44.42. It replaces the worst population
member, which is combination #2 above with a ﬁt function of 55.88. The evolved population is:
3.
Generation 2: the ﬁrst and third population members are randomly selected. The merge is:
0001011
0101001 ) 00101 ) 0001011. The objective value is 39.92. It is better than the worst population
member, but it is identical to the ﬁrst one, so the population is not changed and the offspring is
discarded.

5.
The process continues until the number of generations reaches a prespeciﬁed limit. Note that once
the optimal solution is a member of the population, it can never be removed from it, because no
offspring can be ‘‘superior.’’ So, the optimal combination (now #4 in the population) will stay in the
population until we stop the evolution process and will be the best population member and thus the
solution.
6.
Observe the evolutionary process. The ﬁttest survives and the quality of population members
improves throughout the generations. There is no guarantee that the optimal solution will be
detected, but experience shows that the evolutionary process is very efﬁcient and results in very
good solutions.
5.4.2
Illustrating the Steepest Descent Algorithm
A steepest descent approach is a search procedure that checks all ‘‘nearby’’ solutions in the
neighborhood. We deﬁne the neighborhood as the set of all combinations for which one ‘‘1’’ is
moved to another variable with a ‘‘0’’ value (thus retaining three ‘‘1’’s in the combination). Every
combination has 12 neighbors. Suppose that the offspring is 0101010 with an objective function of
41.14 (see Table 5.2). The neighbors of 0101010 along with their objective function values are
listed in Table 5.3. For example, combination 1001010 was obtained by moving the ‘‘1’’ from
second place to ﬁrst place.
The best neighbor is 1101000 with an objective function of 33.35. Since 33.35 is lower than
41.14 (the original value of the objective function), the change is accepted. The steepest descent
continues until there is no improved combination in the neighborhood. Such a steepest descent
algorithm may or may not ﬁnd the optimal solution.
5.4.3
Illustrating a Mutation
Suppose that the offspring 0101010 is selected for a mutation. A mutation is moving one ‘‘1’’ to
another place to replace a ‘‘0.’’ It is equivalent to selecting one of the 12 neighboring members (see
Table 5.3) as the mutated offspring. The mutation may or may not improve the value of the
objective function. On occasion, the value of the objective function deteriorates. Reviewing
Table 5.3, one ﬁnds that 5 out of 12 possible mutations improve the offspring (i.e., have an
objective function value lower than 41.14) while 7 of the 12 possible mutations are harmful.
Therefore, randomly performing a mutation on 0101010, there is a 5/12 ¼ 41.7% probability
that the offspring is improved. Some researchers suggest that only improving mutations should be
accepted, while the majority has the opinion that every mutation should be accepted, as is the case
in nature.

5.4.4
Calculating Diversity
Genetic diversity can be measured by calculating the distances between population members. The
distance between any two members is deﬁned as the number of genes with different values. For
example, the distances between the members of the initial population in the post ofﬁce, for example
are:
The total distance is 80. The expected distance between any two different combinations is 60/
17  3.53, therefore the expected sum of (20) distances between members of a population of 5 (all
different from one another) is 1200/17  70.59. This means that the randomly generated starting
population (with a total distance of 80) is more genetically diverse than expected. When the genetic
algorithm progresses, distances tend to decrease, therefore genetic diversity (total distance) de-
creases as well. The ﬁve best combinations in Table 5.2 have a total distance of 56, that means less
diversity than average. Note that the lowest possible diversity is 40. A population consisting of the
last ﬁve combinations in Table 5.2 has a distance of ‘‘2’’ between any two different members, and
thus a sum of 40. Since all population members are different from each other, the minimum possible
distance between any two different population members is ‘‘2’’ and thus 40 is the lowest possible
sum of distances for a population of 5.
When higher genetic diversity is maintained, convergence of the population is slowed down and
more generations are required. Therefore, the run time of the algorithm increases. It is therefore
important to balance both the advantages of achieving greater diversity and the disadvantages of
increased run time.
5.5
APPLICATION: BALANCING A TURBINE ENGINE
In Chapter 4 of this book, Lipson describes various applications of genetic algorithms mainly in the
ﬁeld of robotics. We describe here an engineering application and demonstrate the effectiveness of
genetic algorithms.
The turbine balancing problem, suggested by Laporte and Mercure (1988), is a good example of
the effectiveness of genetic algorithms. Consider the manufacturing of a turbine engine, such as a
hydro turbine or a jet engine, with n blades. The blades are inserted into equally spaced slots. To
function properly, the turbine must be balanced. If all blades are identical, the turbine engine is
balanced. In reality, there are slight variations in the weights of different blades, therefore, the
turbine is not perfectly balanced. Suppose that the weights are designed to be 5 kg each and
the variations across blades are in the order of magnitude of milligrams. The problem is to ﬁnd the
‘‘correct’’ assignment of blades into slots so that the turbine will be as balanced as possible.
Let the blades’ deviation from the ideal weight be: di for i ¼ 1, . . . , n. The angles of the slots are:
2i
n for i ¼ 1, . . . , n. Let blade p(i) (p denotes a permutation) be installed in slot i. A perfectly
balanced turbine will satisfy:

The turbine engine example is a symmetric quadratic assignment problem (QAP). The QAP was
ﬁrst proposed by Koopmans and Beckmann (1957) and is well researched (Burkard, 1990; Taillard,
1991, 1995; Burkard et al., 1997; Cela, 1998; Rendl, 2002). The general QAP formulation is as
follows. Given two n  n matrices (aij) and (bij), ﬁnd a permutation p(i) which minimizes:
X

ap(i)p( j)bij
A symmetric problem fulﬁlls aij ¼ aji and bij ¼ bji. In our turbine balancing problem aij ¼ didj
except aii ¼ 0; and bij ¼ cos 2(ij)
n
except bii ¼ 0.
There are many applications for the QAP. For example, planning the layout of an ofﬁce
complex. There are n planned ofﬁces and n employees to be assigned to them. The interaction
between any two employees (aij) and the physical distance between any two ofﬁces (bij) are known.
The problem is to assign employees to ofﬁces such that those who interact extensively are as close
as possible to each other. The objective is to ﬁnd the best assignment of employees to ofﬁces so that
the sum of the products of the interactions and the distances is minimized. A variant of this setting is
incorporating the probability that a customer of this complex needs to visit two or more ofﬁces to
complete the service. The objective in this case is to minimize the total distance to the customer.
170
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

Many pairs of ofﬁces will have zero interaction whereas others may have a negative interaction
(such as in planning a military base, top secret intelligence ofﬁces should be as far as possible from
the cafeteria or other frequently visited ofﬁces). Planning a keyboard of 26 letters (Burkard and
Offermann, 1977) is a QAP. The interactions are the probabilities of typing a letter following
another letter, and the distances are the distances between the letter-keys on the keyboard. Different
languages require different key conﬁgurations (even for the same letters). Planning an airplane
dashboard (Drezner, 1980) requires consideration of the frequency that a pilot uses an instrument in
conjunction with another instrument as the interaction factor. The wiring problem of an electronic
board or the construction of a computer chip are additional examples of QAPs, where the wiring
distance between components that send signals to one another has to be minimized (Steinberg,
1961). For a discussion of QAP applications, see Cela (1998).
The QAP is considered one of the most complicated combinatorial optimization problems.
Algorithms that guarantee ﬁnding the optimal solution are very inefﬁcient. Only recently have
problems of up to n ¼ 36 facilities (blades in our example) been optimally solved. Anstreicher et al.
(2002) solved a problem with n ¼ 30 facilities using multiple computers requiring a total computer
time of over 6 years. The number of permutations (ignoring identical solutions due to symmetry) is
n!. For n ¼ 20, evaluating all of the permutations will take over 77,000 years if every permutation
is evaluated in a millionth of a second. Therefore, a large body of research focuses on heuristic
algorithms. There are several proposed genetic algorithms for the solution of the QAP (Fleurent and
Ferland, 1994; Tate and Smith, 1995; Ahuja et al., 2000; Drezner, 2003, 2005b).
The best available hybrid genetic algorithms for the solution of QAP problems are Drezner
(2003, 2005c). The merging procedure of the parents is the same in both algorithms. It is referred to
as the cohesive merging procedure (Drezner, 2003). The algorithms differ in the improvement
algorithm applied to the offspring before it is considered for inclusion in the population. For
complete details, see Drezner (2005b).
5.5.1
A Turbine Balancing Example
We randomly generated a turbine-balancing problem with 20 blades. For simplicity, we multiply
the cosine values by 10,000 and round them off to the nearest integer. The data are given in Table
5.4. We add the sum of the squares of the di to the objective function. Because of rounding-off,
errors introduced by rounding the cosine values, the best found solution is negative (1,550).

Genetic Algorithms in Optimization Models

We solved the QAP problem using a Fortran code compiled by Microsoft PowerStation 4.0 for
Windows. The code uses integer values for the parameters. The experiments were performed on a
desktop PC with 2.8 GHz CPU and 256 MB RAM.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm, we ﬁrst report in Table 5.5 the results
of the steepest descent and the Ring Moves (RM) (Drezner, 2005b) for various levels without using
any evolution. Each algorithm was run 10,000,000 (ten million) times. The best solution, average
solution, and time in seconds for 10,000 runs are reported. The best solution, found with hybrid
genetic algorithms reported below of 1,550, has never been found by any of these 10,000,000
experiments. The quality of the solution increases as the number of levels increases, but it does not
seem to merit the extra computer time.
For the genetic algorithms we employ the hybrid genetic algorithm described in Drezner
(2005b) using the steepest descent, and RM with 10 and 25 levels. The population size is 100,
with 10,000 generations for each solution. Each replication is run 1,000 times thus a total
of 10,000,000 offspring are generated. In Table 5.6 we report the number of times the best
known solution (1550) was found, the average solution, the maximum solution, and the
run time required for one run. To demonstrate some of the modiﬁcations, we repeated the runs
with the gender-speciﬁc modiﬁcation (Drezner and Drezner, 2005) and the distance modiﬁcation
using K ¼ 1, 2, . . . , 5, for a total of 30 experiments. The results of the experiments are depicted
in Table 5.6.
A comparison of Tables 5.5 and 5.6 clearly shows the beneﬁt derived from employing the
evolutionary process. The average result obtained with the evolutionary process is about the same
as the best results obtained in 10,000,000 runs without evolution and in most cases in a shorter
computer time. For example, the ten-levels case required about 9.4 h to evaluate all 10,000,000
replications without evolution. The best solution of –1,550 was never found in 10,000,000 repli-
cations. However, using a genetic algorithm with a K ¼ 3 distance modiﬁcation and no gender
modiﬁcation required a total of only 7.9 h for 1,000 replications and the best known solution was
found in 63.1% of those replications. Even the steepest descent version with K ¼ 2 found the best-
known solution in 12.5% of the replications in a total run time of 9.5 min.
5.6
DISCUSSION
In this chapter we describe genetic algorithms for solving optimization problems. These algorithms
mimic natural selection and the survival of the ﬁttest principles. Modiﬁcations of the ‘‘standard’’
genetic algorithm are also presented.
Genetic algorithms are based on evolutionary premises, and attempt to simulate natural selec-
tion and survival of the ﬁttest. To survive, species must reproduce and regenerate. This requires new
members of the population to be ﬁt and adaptable to changing environmental conditions. Only the
ﬁttest individuals survive while the weak members perish or are killed by their natural enemies.
Inherent to this theory is, therefore, the deﬁnition of what constitutes the ‘‘ﬁttest.’’ In nature, the

deﬁnition keeps evolving with changing environmental conditions and across species. For example,
the male bird of paradise in New Guinea is the ﬁttest when his feathers and tail are very colorful and
attractive to the female bird of paradise. The same colorful and beautiful male would not be the
ﬁttest in a different environment (off the island), one that is predator rich. Similarly, the peppered
moth, in England, during the Industrial Revolution would not have survived without a color
adaptation. In urban areas, the ﬁttest was the darker peppered moth that adapted to the new gray,
ash-covered trees on which it rests. By blending into the tree, it protected itself from predators,
while at the same time, in rural areas, the peppered moth continued to thrive and survive on lichen-
covered tree branches. Unlike nature, in genetic algorithms the deﬁnition of the ‘‘ﬁttest’’ is stable.
The more stable deﬁnition of ‘‘ﬁttest’’ in genetic algorithms, in turn, allows for the ultimate
achievement of an ‘‘ideal’’ population, a situation not paralleled in nature.
In nature, species have to cope with invasion of other species and competition for resources.
Species diversity is rampant as genetic diversity is instrumental to adaptation. The survival of the
ﬁttest individual leads to survival of the species. In genetic algorithms, by comparison, there is one
species only. Occasionally generating offspring who are ‘‘ﬁtter’’ than existing members in order to
‘‘enrich’’ the population ‘‘gene pool’’ incorporates invasion in genetic algorithms. PGA allow
population movements, but those are of the same species. In compounded genetic algorithms,
there is no population movement between the isolated populations.
Offspring mutation is another natural selection tenet incorporated in genetic algorithms. Muta-
tions occur quite frequently in nature. Most mutations are not beneﬁcial to the species, while some,

on rare occasions, are beneﬁcial, are instrumental in adaptation, and, in fact, produce the ‘‘ﬁttest’’
offspring. Some genetic algorithms incorporate mutations, some of which are beneﬁcial.
Other similarities consist of gender-based traits and procedures for replacing and removing
population members. In addition, nature allows for population or species growth and decline. These
are occasionally practiced in genetic algorithms as well.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of evolutionary processes on a turbine balancing problem.
Solving the problem without employing the evolutionary process does not result in good solutions.
Seventy million attempts at its solution did not ﬁnd the best known solution even once. Applying
the hybrid genetic algorithm 1,000 times (which is faster than 10,000,000 replications of a non-
evolutionary algorithm), found the best known solution (in one variant) 691 times out of 1,000
replications. The superiority of the evolutionary process is clearly demonstrated.

INTRODUCTION
A revolution is quietly brewing. The numerous systems and subsystems of intelligent, agile
synthetic organisms are rapidly improving in efﬁcacy. And yet, the tremendous scope of this action
may be less than obvious to the casual observer, because the various points of evidence are rarely
examined in tandem. This chapter seeks to highlight trends that indicate that biorobotics stands
poised to strongly affect our new century.
Our biology and our technology are converging on numerous fronts: genetic engineering,
augmented cognition, artiﬁcial life, and bio-inspired robotics are some examples. While this
chapter focuses on robotics, the boundaries between disciplines grow increasingly porous. This
chapter does not try to limit its purview to technologies that are relevant to robotics exclusively;
much of biomimetic robotics overlaps with other disciplines. Yet this chapter does consider robots
177

in particular, especially robotics’ ambition to physically interact with the world usually guided by
bio-inspired intelligent control systems.
Though many robots bear little semblance to animals, in some regards, robotics’ relationship
to biology is essential. In their more complete, integrated incarnations, robots can be considered to
be synthetic animals containing the perceptual systems, intelligence, motility, and mobility needed
to operate in the world in ways that are derivative of animals or inspired by them. To wit, the
accelerating functionality of robots can be largely traced to the widening intersection of biology and
engineering.
The biosciences and robotics are each exhibiting unprecedented, explosive rates of discovery
and innovation (Kurzweil, 2002), and their junction increasingly operates as a hybrid discipline
known by several alternate names: biomimetics, biorobotics, and bio-inspired robotics being
among them. As bio-discoveries are translated into robotics, the resulting robots look, act, and
function ever more like animals — synthetic organisms which then offer biologists opportunities to
test theories of animal locomotion, intelligence, and materials. This synergistic interplay represents
a feedback loop that propels the pace of discovery and innovation in both biology and technology
and this interplay between biology and robotics is largely the subject of this chapter.
The concept is not new. For thousands of years, people have sought to emulate animals and
people in various media; and as far back as ancient Egypt and Greece, the media included
mechanical automata (Cassell, 2001). In the 19th and 20th centuries, advances in electromotors,
batteries, materials, and manufacturing enabled these artiﬁcial creatures to move with increasingly
lifelike grace and autonomy. While bodies of robots do not yet possess the full capabilities of
humans or animals, the accomplishments and the pace of progress in these areas exceed those of
any other time in history. Already, robots walk and run bipedally in the fashion of humans (Doi,
2004), affect realistic facial expressions (Hanson et al., 2003), ﬂy like hummingbirds (Dickinson,
2001), and perform many other animal-like feats.
In parallel with the progress of synthetic bodies, artiﬁcial brains have evolved swiftly as well.
With the 20th century information sciences, technology began to emulate the nervous system,
beginning with the work of McCulloch and Pitts, Turing, Walter and others (McCorduck, 1979).
From these pioneers, the work has continued with new generations of robotics and artiﬁcial
intelligence (AI) researchers. In AI research, engineers coordinate with biosciences under the
rubric of cognitive science to the profound beneﬁt of both robotics and neuroscience. Since the
foundations of AI research in the 1940s, AI systems have increased enormously in functionality,
and have become widely deployed in commercial applications, such that AI now constitutes a
nearly $9 billion market (BCC, 2003a,b).
While most pioneering AI research focused on a ‘‘top-down’’ symbolic approach that largely
disregarded the importance of a body or embodiment, the work of Brooks and others pushed the
paradigm of intelligence as forming from ‘‘bottom-up’’ — highly distributed and physically-
embodied architectures (Brooks, 1991). This perspective reinvigorated the emulation of animal
and human bodies in robotics, and is validated by much bio and neuroscience, including the work of
Damasio (1994) , which shows that the mind and body are integrally connected, that the abstract
mind does not ﬂoat mysteriously above the organism as Descartes postulated. In addition to
validating research in locomotion, sensing and grasping, this paradigm shift frees researchers and
companies to consider biomimetic displays of anthropomorphic emotion, animated by software
models of ‘‘emotional intelligence’’; and together these tools are characteristic of the booming ﬁeld
of social robotics (Breazeal, 2002).
Although rhetoric generally discusses terms of ‘‘top-down’’ or ‘‘bottom-up’’, most progress is
clearly being rendered in patches of the middle actually, somewhere between top and bottom. The
spreading complexity of this patchwork progress mirrors the ‘‘systems paradigm’’ of biosciences. In
this paradigm, an organism, even an intelligent human organism, is a highly integrated web of
systems. For example, it is well demonstrated that the intelligence of human brain suffers terribly
should any of several ‘‘lower’’ brain systems (such as the amygdala) be damaged (Damasio, 2005).
178
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

Largely a reapplication of information processing theory to biology (arising from the hybrid
discipline of bioinformatics), this systems paradigm of life as an integrated web of interaction at
many scales, has largely moved to center of the biological sciences, complementing the reductionist
view of the organism (Dickinson et al., 2000). This chapter adopts this paradigm to frame a biorobot
as an artiﬁcial organism — a me´lange of composites, subsystems, and integrated supersystems,
which are assembled to achieve a desired function, or multiple functions as the case may be.
To be deﬁnitively a robot though, an artiﬁcial organism must be capable of motility or mobility or
both. Otherwise, the phrase ‘‘artiﬁcial organism’’ can apply to biorobot’s close cousins: artiﬁcial life,
computer animated agents, and the like. Physical embodiment, the ability to move, the ability to
grasp and handle objects, to locomote: these distinguish a robot. And yet clearly, the overlapping of
technologies makes it difﬁcult, and almost arbitrary, to deﬁne ‘‘robotics’’ at this stage. Indeed, many
technologies are relevant to robotics function and are useful without mobile physical bodies, with
examples including machine vision, automatic speech recognition (ASR), and natural language
processing (NLP). Alternately, the robot-like body may exist perfectly well without intelligence, as
is the case with animatronics — entertainment robots used in themeparks and ﬁlms. Truthfully,
many technologies relevant to robotics have yet to be integrated into robots or into whole synthetic
organisms. Such integration represents one of the grand challenges in biomimetic robotics.
As such integration inches forward, robots will reap beneﬁts from the numerous bio-inspired
technologies that are ﬂowering presently. Bio-inspired tunable optics (Buckley et al., 2004), bio-
inspired sensors, actuators (Bar-Cohen, 2002), and materials promise to boost the performance of
robots. Make no mistake, robots also beneﬁt from technology advances that are not bio-inspired,
such as advanced manufacturing technologies like MicroElectricalMechanical systems (MEMS)
and shape deposition manufacturing (SDM).
Many of these technologies can be well used to emulate biological systems. For example,
advanced manufacturing technologies result in faster, iterative robot design (Bailey et al., 2000),
more complex yet affordable robots, and designs at meso, micro, and even nanometer scales.
Advanced digital visualization tools are enabling better design and ﬁnite element testing before the
expense and trouble of manufacturing. Numerous shifts in design paradigms can be associated with
the new tools of manufacturing, design, and the biological sciences.
Biological systems are more capable than technology in countless ways. And yet, technology is
capable in some ways that biology is not. Moreover, when performing the same task as an
organism, humans can often use very different strategies, for example, aerofoil wings versus
ﬂapping wings to achieve ﬂying. So, the most effective robotic creatures can be an amalgam of
pure technology and translated or emulated biology.
When emulating bio-systems, the design approach may be either directly imitative (biomi-
metics) or inspired by physical principles derived from the study of organisms (bio-inspired). In the
ﬁrst approach, technology approximates the end result or function of an organ or organism, for
example: when rotary motors turn leg joints, the mechanics are very different from those of
biological leg muscles, though the effected end motion of the leg is similar. In the second approach,
the principles extracted from bio-systems may be applied in ways very much unlike those exhibited
in the originating organism; for example, the crystalline structures of starﬁsh eyes are being used to
create far more efﬁcient ﬁber-optic routing hubs (Aizenberg et al., 2001). The two sets are not
mutually exclusive — there are many derivations and combinations of these techniques, and the end
objective is similar to create machines that move and function usefully by transferring bio-systems
into techno-systems.
Truly, as physical nature manifested through biological evolution, it solved a staggering number
of design and engineering problems. The job of the bioroboticist, then, is to discover and to abstract
these solutions, and to implement them in the limited media of human technology.
Computers grow more powerful and cheaper. Materials are growing more diverse and effective
in many ways. Manufacturing technologies are growing more automated, efﬁcient, effective, and
ﬂexible.
Robotic Mechanisms

Additionally, the markets for robotics and AI are increasing; they are up tenfold from 1992 to
2002 (UNECE-A) and are projected to expand tenfold again by 2010. The market for personal and
mobile robots, which tend to be more bio-inspired, appears poised to surpass industrial robots this
year (Kara, 2004). According to the U.N., the market for robotics was up 34% each year from 2002
to 2004, and is projected to expand sevenfold from 2004 to 2007, with the largest gains in the
consumer and entertainment robotics (UNECE, 2004).
It does appear that the age of biorobotics is neatly unfolding.
Please note: the speciﬁc examples of robots and technology cited in this chapter are far from
comprehensive. The chapter’s chosen examples are not necessarily more highly meritorious than
others not mentioned, but rather represent an arbitrary cross-section of research that embodies bio-
inspired principles. The ﬁeld is rich with quickly evolving research and researchers. The author
extends apologies to all those researchers whose work is not represented in this chapter, and
encourages readers to research independently to obtain a more effective image of work in this
rich ﬁeld.
6.2
MOBILITY AND MOTILITY: FLYING, WALKING, CRAWLING, MANIPULATION
For many kinds of interaction with the real physical world, technology must have the ability to
move. Such mechanically effected, controlled motion is a distinguishing aspect of robotics. This
motion can be merely motile — anchored like the motion of an industrial robotic arm (biologically
analogous to the anchored motile arms of an anemone), or the motion may be locomotive (like the
ﬂying of a bumblebee).
In all motive and locomotive modes of action, certain issues must be considered — sensing,
mechanical forces and resonances at play, and controls. Beyond these, the end application will
guide the modes of motion required, and together these will determine the speciﬁc, associated
engineering challenges (Bar-Cohen, 1999, 2002).
Undeniably, creating machines that move like animals can involve signiﬁcant challenges. For
one thing, most available motors do not behave like animal muscles, neither mechanically nor in
their controls. Unlike conventional electromotors, biological muscles are inherently linear in
actuation, and are compliant. The linear action of muscles more efﬁciently effects animal-like
motion than do rotary electromotors, and the compliant properties appear key to biological motor
control schemes (Full and Meijer, 1999).
In another extreme difference from biological motor systems, today’s robot technology cannot
maintain or repair itself. This means that many of the materials and motors used in robots must be
even more robust than similar-function materials in animals for the devices to have useful lifespans.
While someday robots may be endowed with self-repair capabilities (perhaps thanks to improving
genetic or protein engineering, MEMS automation, or nano-machines), for now, robots must be
overengineered for durability, and they must be regularly serviced or replaced.
The end application will determine the readiness of today’s technology. Long-term constant
duty applications, like robots used in theme parks or outer space exploration, require very robust
materials and construction (Hanson and Pioggia, 2001). However, low-duty applications, such as
short promotional appearances or ﬁlm special effects, may operate in considerably shorter duty
cycles, in less difﬁcult environment conditions, and with lower requirements on lifespan.
Accordingly, various applications have varying motive requirements. For exploring Mars,
stability over irregular terrain is a critical priority, and therefore a hexapod like McGill’s Rhex
might be more apropos than a biped. For entertainment applications on the other hand, aesthetic
impact on an audience is the critical priority, and so biped humanoids like Honda’s Asimo would
likely serve better.
Fortunately for robotics applications engineers, an unprecedented bounty of robotic motion
technologies is available to choose from, and still others are emerging encouragingly.

6.2.1
Locomotion Principles
Robots presently display a wide variety of legged locomotion strategies (Hanson et al., 2003). Some
engineers explore sprawled-leg hexapod conﬁgurations akin to those of cockroaches, while others
build robots that hop on a singular leg. Others yet build robots that walk or run on two like a turkey,
a dinosaur, or even in the fashion of a human. And still others create robots that self-reconﬁgure to
adopt multiple locomotion styles (Fitch et al., 2000; Butler et al., 2002).
These robots are sometimes built just to resemble animals, while others utilize the physics of
animal locomotion and controls.
Unlike animals, most current legged robots do not employ mechanical compliance, instead
using rigid mechanical systems and, sometimes, computationally intensive digital PID loop con-
trols (although PID loops may be rendered much less expensive and intensive by using analog
elements). Animals, on the other hand, use a number of techniques involving mechanical compli-
ance to simplify controls and absorb shock, regardless of the number of legs. Full and Meijer (1999)
show that during animal-legged locomotion energy is stored in the spring-like compliant materials
as the animal lands in a stride, and then the energy is reemitted as the animal springs forward in the
stride, a dynamic that is akin to an inverted pendulum.
More than 20 years ago, Marc Raibert developed springy, dynamically stable-legged robots,
utilizing the principles described in the preceding paragraph (Raibert, 1983); numerous versions of
these robots bounced, ran, and turned ﬂips to the world’s delight (see Figure 6.1). Since then, many
robots have used this principle, as MIT’s spring series elastic actuators, in Stanford’s urethane–
rubber Sprawl series, and in many others.
In addition to absorbing energy, though, the viscous properties of the compliant material in leg
biomaterial also dampen the vibrations associated with locomotion (Full, 2000), thus stabilizing the

locomotion. And so the visco-elastic biomaterials serve several functions during locomotion:
absorbing shock, stabilizing, and improving locomotion energy efﬁciency (Full and Meijer, 1999).
Moreover, the resonance of the compliant biomaterials appears to perform as the oscillating
elements of analog computers, dynamically stabilizing animal locomotion in response to the
terrain — a low-level intelligence function labeled ‘‘preﬂex’’ by Brown et al. (1996). Note that
such preﬂex would function separately from nerve activity, involving only well-tuned mechanical
compliance.
In a dramatic display of this principle transferred into a robot, Stanford’s Sprawlita robots
traverse highly complex terrain with no sensor feedback at all, stabilized only by the feedforward-
responsive, rubbery compliance of its body and legs (Kim et al., 2004). The latest robot in the
Sprawl series, the small (0.3 kg) autonomous iSprawl runs at 15 body lengths per second — several
times faster than earlier, slower bio-inspired robots (see Figure 6.2). And yet examination and
analysis of iSprawl shows the same bouncing, stable locomotion patterns in as those seen in insects
(Kim et al., 2004).
Comparable to iSprawl, the Mini-Whegsy of Case Western Reserve University is smaller and
lighter than iSprawl, predates iSprawl and runs at 10 body lengths per second. Mini-Whegs also run
rapidly over obstacles that are taller than their legs. The Whegs robots are discussed further in the
next section.
Full and Meijer (1999) show that the principles of compliant locomotion hold regardless of leg
number, but with some variations. Full and Meijer also ﬁnd that in locomotion with four or more
legs, the leading two legs absorb shock and stabilize an animal, while the rear two legs provide
propulsion. In animals with six or more legs, the middle legs provide combined propulsion and
stabilization. In animals with two legs or mono-style hoppers (like a kangaroo), the legs serve for
both shock absorption and propulsion.
Implementing these biological strategies will be more challenging in biped robots, so, many
researchers are initially implementing them in hexapod robots. Such an insect-like hexapod
architecture offers inherent stability, especially when employed with a ground-hugging, sprawl-
legged posture. One sees such a posture in lizards, crabs, cockroaches, and spiders. Both the

stability of a sprawled posture and of an increased number of legs reduce the complexity of controls
and decrease likelihood of catastrophic fall or inversion. Full hypothesizes that six legs offer an
optimal accord between stability and complexity (1999), extra legs being expensive to build,
creating potential failure points, and requiring extra energy to operate.
On the other hand, multipurpose extra limbs could serve as alternate legs for the six in case
of emergency, and in the interim they could operate as sensor antennae, or as arms tipped with
manipulators or instruments.
Similar to Sprawl, in the Rhex robot of McGill the compliance of the six legs improves the
stability and controls of the robot; but Rhex can alternately also run on two legs, in the manner of a
toddler. Such reconﬁgurable design promises to enable robots to be less domain-speciﬁc, and more
capable of meeting the demands of real-world operations. Reconﬁgurable robots are further
discussed in Section 6.2.2.
6.2.2
Flexibility, Hybrids, and Reconﬁguration
Real-world performance can require ﬂexibility and multipurpose applicability in mechanical
architecture. To achieve this ﬂexibility, roboticists have introduced novel hybrid systems such as
wheel–leg combinations (such as the Whegs of Case Western), or reconﬁgurable architectures that
can morph between walking, crawling, and slithering morphologies (such as the crystal robots of
Dartmouth and MIT).
Slithering morphologies are inherently ﬂexible, enabling robots to crawl through tight spaces,
such as arteries, caves, or sewers, in a snakelike or centipede-like manner. The snake robot S5
(1998–1999) built by Gavin Miller, demonstrates untethered legless snakelike slithering locomo-
tion (see Figure 6.3). Miller’s S1–S5 build on earlier work by Shigeo Hirose of Japan, in which
oscillatory deﬂections travel down the length of the snake causing the snake to move forward, while
offset to oscillations steer the device.
MAKRO, a snake robot the Fraunhofer Institute for Autonomous Intelligent Systems in St
Augustin, Germany, boasts an articulated-wheeled, segmented design that enables maneuverability

around sharp bends, over refuse, and up stairs. Most other sewer robots are tethered by power and
control cables and navigate uni-directionally. The wireless, waterproof, and two-headed MAKRO,
however, can autonomously navigate bi-directionally, monitoring its own position, detecting sewer
landmarks, and enacting mission tasks, such as taking sewage samples.
Case Western Reserve University robot Whegs II combines wheels and legs, words that contract
to spell ‘‘whegs,’’ now a trademarked word for wheel–leg combinations (see Figure 6.4). In Whegs
II, a bio-inspired design of the leg is made more functional by the addition of the useful,
nonbiological structure of the wheel. Whegs II boasts a segmented body that enables complex,
insect-like ﬂexures that allow the climbing of large obstacles with improved stability. What makes
Whegs really interesting is that they use only one propulsion motor, yet passively adapt their gait to
the terrain using preﬂexive components. Because of these advantages, Whegs II can climb obstacles
taller than twice their leg lengths, accelerate so rapidly as to jump, and also run faster than 3 body
lengths per second.
Other compound wheel–leg combinations show promise as well. McGill’s ANT hybrid archi-
tecture, with springy, biologically inspired legs that are tipped with actuated wheels, results in
vehicles that can substantially outperform vehicles which use wheels or tank-treads alone (Steeves
et al., 2002).
To contend with the mutability of the real world, a robot may need to change shape and function
on the ﬂy. Many bio-systems self-reconﬁgure to meet environmental circumstances, and this ability
is the inspiration for reconﬁgurable robotics (Fukuda and Kawakuchi, 1990; Rus and Vona, 2001).
For example, a robot could assume a ﬂat or snakelike form to squeeze though a slim passage, but
then morph into a hexapod to traverse rough terrain upon exiting the passage. Reconﬁgurable
robotics researchers do not just focus on macroanimal forms though. Some researchers draw
reconﬁguration analogies to molecules and in particular folding proteins, in robots labeled ‘‘mol-
ecule robots’’ (Kotay and Rus, 1999) (see Figure 6.5).
6.2.3
Walking and Running
Other roboticists choose a four-legged or quadruped conﬁguration. While not as stable as a
hexapod, especially over rugged terrain, four legs do offer better inherent static stability than
two- or one-leg architectures.
In 1999, Sony introduced the Aibo robot dog (Figure 6.6) a quadruped robot with an RISC
processor, camera, and quadruped locomotion, and in this regard Aibo is distinguished from low-

cost toys by being a truly sophisticated biomimetic robot, with a battery of sensors and nimble legs.
Since the robot’s introduction, over 140,000 units have sold mostly to tech enthusiasts, but also to
numerous robotics and AI labs, such as Luc Steels, who use the Aibo’s sophisticated feature set to
investigate navigation, and the vision plus speech sensor fusion in learning (Steels, 2001).
Though emulating humanlike locomotion is a much more challenging task than hexapod
locomotion, numerous Japanese ﬁrms have long poured resources into biped locomotion research.
In recent years, these efforts have borne fruit, with many ﬁrms revealing stable humanlike bipeds,
including Honda, Sony, Toyota, Kawada, Fujitsu, ERATO, VStone, and Wow Wee Toys (see
Figure 6.7). While such robots may not be ready for applications such as rescue operations, etc.,
biped robots are great for entertainment and publicity.
These robots dynamically stabilize in response to live data from six-axis gyro-accelerometer
sensors, taking advantage of fast computation and small footprint of today’s processors, and
wireless uplink to more computation.
When walking, these robots employ a ‘‘controlled fall,’’ where the walking speed maintains a
zero moment point (zmp) such that with each footstep, the ﬁgure catches itself from the fall. While
this controlled fall is also exhibited in human walking, in other ways, these above bipeds resemble
humans in form and not in physics. As discussed earlier in this chapter, animals utilize springy
gaits, whereas most biped robots do not, instead relying on rigid mechanical systems. Thus, most

locomote by using a ‘‘tumbling’’ gait.

bipeds do not receive the shock absorption, ‘‘preﬂex’’ stabilizing advantages, or inverse-pendulum
energy-recycling advantages of mechanically compliant animal locomotion systems.
At least one humanlike biped does take advantage of mechanical compliance: the low cost Wow
Wee ‘‘RoboSapien’’ biped (Figure 6.7a) engineered by physicist Mark Tilden. As a result of this,
Robosapien is more energy efﬁcient than other biped humanoids, running for several hours on a
charge (versus Sony’s and Honda’s bipeds, which run for ~30 min on a charge).
Of the publicly-shown biped robots, the 18 in. tall Sony Qrio (Figure 6.7b) shows the greatest
range of biped functionality and cognitive abilities. As a biped, the robot cannot just walk, but run,
hop, and right itself from a fall. Its movements are extremely swift, graceful, and humanlike, and its
grasping hands enable Qrio to toss a ball.
Of human-scale bipeds, the HRP-2P of Kawada, Japan is remarkable for its ability to climb to its
feet from a lying posture (Figure 6.7c).
The rate of progress in the ability of legged robots and bipeds, in particular, is extremely
encouraging. It is easy to imagine that such devices will be commonplace in entertainment and
service applications in coming years.
6.2.4
Flying, etc.
Many biomimetic or bio-inspired ﬂying robots have shown swift progress of late. Many of these
imitate the small scale ﬂight of insects, while others ﬂy at larger scales, after the fashion of birds.
The Micromechanical Flying Insect (MFI) Project at University of California, Berkeley has
demonstrated a 30-mm MFI prototype (see Figure 6.8), using piezoelectric actuators and a ﬂexible
thorax structure to incur notable thrust force (Dickinson, 2001) and demonstrate ﬂight (MFI
Website, 2002). This performance results from extensive studies of the aerodynamics of ﬂy-wings
in motion, which explain how ﬂies generate three times as much lift as was previously understood
(Dickinson, 2001). This work demonstrates that insect ﬂight results from three phenomena: the
leading-edge vortex (or delayed stall), the rotational lift, and the wake capture. Funded by DARPA,
ONR, and MURI, the ultimate goal of the MFI project is to produce autonomous military robots.
The Mentor robot (1998 to 2002) of SRI International and University of Toronto was the ﬁrst
ﬂapping wing microaviation vehicle (MAV) capable of hovering in place. Weighing 435 g, and 30
cm in height, the double-hummingbird X-wing model ﬂew in a tethered mode, demonstrating both
hovering and forward ﬂight (DeLaurier, 2003). University of Toronto designed and built the
complete aircraft system and SRI investigated actuating the device with dielectric-type electro-
active polymers (EAP) artiﬁcial muscles.

Many other bio-inspired morphologies of locomotion exist in robots, from ﬁsh robots that can
swim like manta rays, to lobster robots, and to robots that tumble like tumbleweeds. The reader is
encouraged to investigate further the astonishing diversity of robotic locomotion that is currently
ﬂowering in the world.
6.2.5
Grasping and Manipulation
Many robots need the ability to grasp and handle objects. On a large scale, this may be done in
the manner of hands, claws, or teeth, while at a smaller scale the task may be accomplished in the
manner of proteins or the sticky feet of ﬂies or geckos.
Numerous issues play into grasping and manipulation. First, the manipulator element must be
guided to the object to be handled, a task that can require machine vision and a high resolution
control system. Second, the mechanical system must be able to reach objects with sufﬁcient
ﬂexibility and dexterity. And when the manipulator handles the object, the manipulator must
contain enough sensors and the right control software to apply just the right amount of force in
the object.
Many robots around the world have accomplished grasping and manipulation tasks, and
some are even developing the ability to learn manipulation tasks by learning and imitation such
as Ripley at MIT, and the juggling robots of USC Georgia Tech and MIT (Atkeson and Schaal,
1997).
Shadow Robotics of the U.K. has developed a robotic hand with 24 degrees of freedom (DOF),
driven by McKibben air muscles. Most of the joints are driven by an opposing pair of muscles,
permitting variable compliance at the joint; however, some of the ﬁnger joints are driven by a single
muscle with return spring. The Shadow hand operates at about half speed of a human.
The NASA Robonaut, a humanoid torso for outer space applications, boasts a pair of dexterous
arms enabling dual-arm operations, and 14 DOF hands that interface directly with a wide range of
tools. Using a humanlike model for autonomous grasping, the Robonaut relies heavily on feedback
from its robotic ﬁngers and palm. Numerous sensor technologies are employed including piezo-
ﬁlms, capacitive pressure sensors, and Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) technology. To achieve the
ﬁne resolution of feedback, tactile sensors for grasping, and the smart algorithms for interpretation
of the signals, are systemically dubbed tactile perception. Robonaut’s manipulation capabilities are
being automated, and can also be run by teleoperation to enable delicate space operations via distant
human presence.

6.2.6
Motion Conclusion Summary
Physically actuated embodiment is certainly essential for robots to interface with the real world.
Additionally, many roboticists debate that interface with the complex, nonlinear real world is
important for the formation of intelligence (Brooks, 1991). Whether that is true or not, intelligence
and perceptive systems are of great importance for robots to be effective in the real world.
6.3
BEHAVIOR, EXPRESSIVITY
6.3.1
Intelligence and Perception
The emulation of human and animal central nervous systems (CNS) stands as the most challenging
domain of bio-inspired robotics. While neuroscience is deciphering the mysteries of mind at
unprecedented rates, thanks largely to novel imaging techniques such as fMRI, many components
of machine perception and intelligence are coming into functional maturity. Though not nearly
as capable as humans, many ‘‘human-emulation’’ technologies have sprouted substantially in the last
decade, showing remarkable surges in functionality including face tracking, feature tracking, visual
biometric identiﬁcation, bipedal locomotion, and semantically rich NLP (Kurzweil, 1999; Menzel,
2001; Bar-Cohen and Breazeal, 2003). With these tools, we can sketch crude models of simulated
mind in technological media. The emphasis, however, is on the word ‘‘crude’’: it must be acknow-
ledged that most of the mysteries of the CNS are well beyond science at this time.
Accordingly, machine intelligence is decidedly below that of most animals and certainly
humans. But our machines must be judged on their own standards. After all, a machine can
understand speech better than a dog can, and what’s more, the machine can speak back. Many of
the intelligent and perceptive systems available today have yet to be integrated into functional
whole. This section ﬁrst considers intelligent systems as parts, and then discusses their integration
into a systematically emulated animal intelligence, with a focus on social intelligence.
6.3.1.1 Language, Ontologies, Top-Down
At the foundation of human–machine language interaction lie ASR, automated speech synthesis
(ASS), and various approaches to NLP. Although only capable of rudimentary language inter-
actions, machine language has recently shown a remarkable rate of progress, both in successful
academic research and in deployed speech solutions.
For many years, basic speech recognition and synthesis were major obstacles even to the most
elementary human–computer language interactions. However, progress in the late 1980s and 1990s
led to a large number of deployed speech applications, ranging from dictation software such as
IBM’s Viavoice to natural language ticketing and customer service agents, such as those offered by
ATT. Companies now marketing commercial speech applications include SpeechWorks, Sensory,
Nuance, and Dragon Naturally Speaking. Another highly effective system is open-source to
researchers: Carnegie Mellon’s Sphinx is highly functional, robust, user-independent ASR software
(Carnegie Mellon, website, 2002).
Several common features operate rather naturally; the ‘‘barge-in’’ capability allows users to
interrupt the system and still have speech recognized. ‘‘Rejection and keyword spotting’’ recognizes
a speaker’s keywords without prompts. Using Bayesian analysis, ‘‘N-best’’ sorts through possibil-
ities of what a speaker might have said to locate a correct word, while the statistical language
modeling of ‘‘N-gram’’ creates a sizable vocabulary and natural language recognition.
Word recognition and synthesis is only the ﬁrst step toward endowing machines with humanlike
language intelligence. Text-to-speech (TTS) software outputs increasingly natural-sounding speech,
with off-the-shelf solutions including Rhetorical, Elan, Nuance, and the open-source Festival.
188
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

Between recognition and synthesis, an intelligent system needs to process language, cross-relate
language to vision and other senses (a task known as multimodal sensor fusion), and make decisions
about how to act in this world. Many labs tackle this problem with natural language as the nexus of
the above, an approach known as NLP.
Some NLP researchers ambitiously attempt to completely model human grammars, while others
such as the Cyc project of Austin, Texas model ontological relationships into expert systems — an
approach that has proven successful for some limited applications. Many functional natural
language applications, such as electronic ticketing agents or IBM’s Natural Language Assistant
(NLA) search engine (Chai et al., 2002), compensate for their inability to understand full, general
language by relying on the constraints speciﬁc to the application’s situations. Other ambitious
language-engine projects attempt to model the emergence of language — the paths by which one (a
human or a machine) can acquire language from a social environment.
Under the hypothesis that language is inherently an emergent phenomenon, Luc Steels and other
researchers at the Sony Computer Science Lab in Paris are teaching Sony AIBO robots to recognize
objects via natural language games (Steels and Kaplan, 2002; Boyd, 2002). The results are
promising. While these robots are learning only the simplest of grammars and words, they are
doing so under highly variable conditions, and can recognize learned objects independent of
lighting or viewing angle. In fact, this method has considerably outperformed other language
acquisition systems that used neural networks or symbolic learning labeling theory (Steels and
Kaplan, 2002). Here emphasis is made that such a natural language system is an integration of many
cognitive components: vision, gesturing, pattern recognition, speech analysis and synthesis, con-
ceptualization, interpretation, behavioral recognition, action, etc.
6.3.1.2 Vision, Other Sensing, Sensor Fusion
TheworkofcomputationalneuroscientistCristophvonderMalsberg’stheoriesofcomplex,nonlinear
behavior in neurons has driven the development of numerous successful vision algorithms (Von der
Malsberg and Schneider, 1986). One descendant of Von der Malsberg’s work developed by Mals-
berg’s student Hartmut Nevin, stands out as the most successful tracker of human facial expressions
from live streaming video is sold as NevenVision FFT. NevenVision modules use these theories to
accomplish numerous other vision tasks as well, including biometric face recognition, object, and
gesturerecognitionaswell.Theauthorofthischapteriscurrentlyinvestigatingtheuseofthissoftware
to endow social robots with emotional-expression recognition in context-driven conversation.
The automated face analysis (AFA) software system developed in the Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity Face Lab determines the emotional state of a subject by automatically analyzing images against
Ekman’s facial action coding system (FACS) (Xiao et al., 2002). While this AFA FACS analysis is
not in real time, if optimized and integrated with quick and robust expression recognition software,
this software will greatly advance progress toward complete and effective sociable robot systems.
Using the work of Steels and Kaplan (2002) described in section 6.3.1.1 and others, Sony has
demonstrated the integration of many visual and perceptual systems and speech in its Qrio biped.
The Qrio can biometrically identify a face, recognize, and respond to a person’s facial expressions,
and recognize objects and environmental attributes. The visual ontologies are fused with the
semantic language ontologies, allowing Qrio to converse in a simple but lifelike way about a
number of subjects. This work is a forerunner of integrated machine intelligence systems with
nimble humanlike embodiment.
6.3.2
Social Intelligence, Social Robots, and Robot Visual Identity
Social robots particularly require the fusion of many perceptual, language, and physical embodi-
ment systems — requirements that drive the systematic integration of these components into a
whole that is greater than the sum of parts (Breazeal, 2002).
Robotic Mechanisms

Sparked largely by the mid-1990s MIT graduate work of Cynthia Breazeal, sociable robots
integrate many of these human-emulation technologies into singular synthetic organisms, designed
to communicate more effectively with people (Breazeal, 2002). While these robots only crudely
simulate social cognition, they are being actively used as modeling tools in cognitive science (Fong
et al., 2003). Since Breazeal’s seminal work, a sizable number of sociable robots have sprung into
existence. Although a comprehensive list is beyond the scope of this paper, a few sociable robots
include: Ridley at MIT (lead by Deb Roy), Nursebot Pearl of CMU, Kismet and Leonardo of MIT,
and Mabel at the University of Rochester (built by a team of undergraduates). Additionally,
companies including Panasonic, Sony, and Honda have lately pursued sociable humanoid robots.
Although these robots all seek to achieve bio-inspired communicative interaction with humans,
none has a realistic humanlike face.
In social robots that do have faces, the hardware mimics the expressive action of the human face
— humanity’s primary mode of expressing affective states (Ekman, 1989). Whether depicting a
realistic human or an abstract character (like a cartoon or animal), the expressive animated motions
of the character should be humanlike in order to be sensible to a human, because the human nervous
system is innately and ﬁnely attuned to understand the human face’s visual language (Levenson
et al., 1990; Bruce et al., 2002).
As discussed later in the chapter, this can be a challenging hardware task, and even harder can be
the socially interactive use of facial expressions. Better mechanization and automation of this social
expression could unlock many useful service and entertainment applications from toys to comfort-
ing companions for the elderly. Even in a military scenario, wherein a robot must communicate
swiftly with human soldiers, the power of emotive communications cannot be over-estimated.
The mechanics of the biological human face are well studied; meanwhile the semiotics of
human-facial communication have been preliminarily deﬁned by anthropologist P. Ekman and
others in the aforementioned FACS (Ekman and Friesen, 1971). Body language, also well studied
(Birdwhistle, 1970), can further enable robotics’ sociable applications. While further work remains
to decipher the cognitive systems that underlie dynamic facial effect (including their complex
relation to language), these robots can still be interesting as entertainment, training devices, and as
quantitative tools for the better study of social cognition.
Most hardware technology for simulating facial expression springs from the entertainment
special effects industry, where the technology is used to animate characters in movies, theme
parks, etc. Stan Winston Studios, Walt Disney Imagineering, and Jim Henson Creature Shop, and
many other ‘‘animatronics’’ (themed animation robots) shops, utilize the power of nonverbal
communication, by simulating human and animal faces and ﬁgures in story-telling context. In
these applications, the complexity of social cognition is theatrically designed by animator and
writers, and is not interactive or intelligent. Nevertheless, these approaches that emphasize com-
mercially presentable results have achieved the highest degree of mechanical aesthetic biomimetics
in history (see Figure 6.9), as shown in feature ﬁlms such as AI and Jurrassic Park among others.
Animatronics seems like a natural match for sociable robotics. Indeed, the merger of anima-
tronics and sociable robotics has begun; in 2002, one of the leading shops in animatronics built the
mechanical and aesthetic systems of Cynthia Breazeal’s Leonardo robot (Bar-Cohen and Breazeal,
2003; Landon, 2003) (see Figure 6.10).
As with the work of Luc Steels and Qrio, the Leonardo project uses learning algorithms with
vision–tactile–language knowledge fusion to accomplish learning by imitation. This work is
collinear to that of other MIT groups such as the Cognitive Machines Group (CGM) led by Deb
Roy, in which the robot Ripley uses a grasping mouth to manipulate objects. Ripley clearly has a
machine identity, and no facial expressions. Leonardo, by contrast, boasts 32 DOF in the face,
achieving very agile facial effect. While Leonardo is anthropomorphic, Leonardo is conscientiously
not human in form (Breazeal, 2002). Leonardo team leader Cynthia Breazeal expresses that realistic
animatronic technology is not quite human enough to be convincing, and just human enough to
push people’s expectations of the intelligence of the machine and too high to be met with today’s
190

technology. This hesitation is a point of some debate in the AI community, with most roboticists
believing that cartoon identities are OK, but humanlike ones are not.
One of the most cited manifestations of this argument, the theory of the Uncanny Valley,
appeared in a 1975 essay by Japanese robotics researcher Masahiro Mori (Reichardt, 1978). Here,
Mori speculated that as an anthropomorphic object looks and acts more realistically human, it will
receive increasingly favorable reaction, but only up to a limited point of realism (see Figure 6.11).
After this node, however, the viewer starts to become more distracted by ﬂaws in humanoid
demeanor, such that the object will soon become highly disturbing to a person. This graphic
depression in favorable opinion is the valley of Mori’s Uncanny Valley.
Mori further speculated that should the object increase sufﬁciently in realism, viewer opinion will
eventually rise back out of the valley, cross the neutral threshold of viewer opinion, and ultimately,
Figure 6.9 (See color insert following page 302)

(once appearance rivals realism) will turn into complete acceptance. Based upon this theory, though,
Mori concluded that anthropomorphic robot designs should always stop short of the Uncanny Valley
to avoid public fear and loathing or worse yet: the complete rejection of robots by the public.
Although no data has been collected to substantiate the Uncanny Valley theory, it is the closest
thing to an engineering principle that exists for guiding the design of anthropomorphic robot identity.
It is important to emphasize that the chart provided in Figure 6.3 is conceptual, and not based on data.
Other aspects of the Uncanny Valley theory are specious as well. For example, in the theory,
verisimilitude is not well deﬁned. Many dimensions of aesthetic percept ﬂuctuate widely in the
examples given with the theory. Examples of rising realism leap from a ‘‘stuffed toy’’ to a ‘‘walking
corpse’’ to a ‘‘decorative robot,’’ without quantifying any of the characteristics of the above. Clearly,
disturbing and unhealthy percepts are associated with corpses, which would represent retrograde in
verisimilitude.
Unfortunately, in the intervening years, hard data on the purported phenomenon has yet to be
gathered, in spite of regular debate of the dogma of the Uncanny Valley. In his original theory, Mori
posits that the valley works in both static representation and dynamic. Yet, clearly the ﬁne arts
represent humans in every possible shade of realism, in paintings and illustrations. People are not
horriﬁed by Van Gogh paintings because they are not perfectly realistic. And the realistic motion of
Sony’s Qrio shows that a robot can move just like a real person without being horriﬁc. In short,
although the Uncanny Valley theory may hint at real phenomena, it is not real science.
The author proposes that the Uncanny Valley effect arises from a distributed network of brain-
systems that, in concert, function as an ‘‘emergency alarm.’’ This alarm system becomes acutely
enabled by the detection of high-verisimilitude anthropomorphic stimuli, and rings with alarm if
patterns that signal crisis are detected. But the alarm also will ring (provided it is enabled) if certain
patterns that signal a healthy social presence are not detected. This revised theory is renamed the
theory of Bridge of Engagement (BOE).
Recent brain imaging (LaBar et al., 2003) has found that visual stimulus of moving fear
expressions shown to test subjects activates a distributed pattern involving the pSTS, right lateral
fusiform gyrus (FFA), and the amygdala. Kesler-West et al. (2001) found similar results, but found
that ‘‘happy’’ expressions activated a very different distributed pattern in test subjects than did
visual percepts of negative affect, and this pattern did not include elevated activity in the amygdala,
but instead involved elevations in activity of the medial frontal or cingulate sulcus, an area that has
been found to be critical to the initiation of language (Crosson et al., 1999). These ﬁndings support
the notion that crisis stimuli such as a fearful expression will trigger a neural alarm of fear, whereas
facial stimuli that do not cause fear lead to preparations for social engagement. Additionally, LaBar
et al. (2003) also show that sliding ‘‘identity morphs,’’ which animate identity change from one
individual to another, activate similar distributed neural patterns as do expressions of fear, notably

with elevated activity in the amygdala. This also supports the concept that if high-resolution
identity cues fall outside expected patterns, the brain will signal alarm. While these studies support
the hypothesis of a social emergency alarm that is more sensitive to high-verisimilitude cues, future
experiments are required.
Intuitively, it seems probable that humans’ visual expertise to human faces helps us to receive
the full bandwidth of paralinguistic semantics. If this is true, then realistic faces in robots will
simply be more communicative.
There are other reasons to consider making robots more realistically humanlike. Clearly, realistic
human depictions have been highly successful in arts, ﬁlm, video games, and toys; so the question
naturally arises: why wouldn’t the appeal of realism extend to robots too, if the robots look good
enough? Shades of realism would certainly be critical for many applications, for example: training
models that enact face-to-face exchange, such as medical, police, or psychology simulation. More-
over, accurately modeling the human face allows scientiﬁc investigation of human communication.
Several groups use computer-simulations of realistic faces for their robots and autonomous
agents, for instance: Cassell’s Rea at MIT and Vikea of CMU’s Sociable Robots Group. Perhaps
this is because video games have made humanlike simulations more acceptable. Two exceptions
that pursue realistic faced robot identities include: Fumio Hara’s lab at the Science University of
Tokyo (Hara, 1998) and the work of the author of this paper at the University of Texas at Dallas
(Hanson, 2003; Ferber, 2003) (see Figure 6.12).
Historically, the most successful mechanically emulated faces have been entertainment anima-
tronics, but these robots actually reinforce the bias against realism by being inadequate in their
expressivity, consuming a great deal of power, and being bulky, weighty, and costly. Each of these
faults prohibits widespread deployment beyond high-end niche markets of theme parks and ﬁlm.
Yet, these drawbacks all spring from one cause: the great force required by animatronics’ solid-
elastomer skins to deform into facial expressions.
The solid elastomer materials that are currently in use to emulate facial soft tissues require
relatively large amounts of force to move, which leads to high costs, high power requirements, and
aesthetic movement unlike human facial tissue. In spite of the pliable, elastic qualities of solid
elastomers, the molecules of such elastomer tangle with their near neighbors, fundamentally
constraining the material when deformed. The molecules of facial ﬂesh are not so constrained,
being in effect an array of liquid-ﬁlled tissue-sacs, which allows molecules of liquid to ﬂow into any

sity of Texas at Dallas.

topological form that cells and fascia will tolerate. Squeeze a water balloon in one hand and a
sphere of solid rubber in the other, and the differences become quickly apparent (Hanson and
White, 2004). The use of currently available materials causes the resulting mechanism to be power
hungry, massive, and costing more than $80,000 to manufacture (Menzel and D’Aluisio, 2000); yet,
animatronic-face hardware nevertheless sells vigorously in niche-markets of movie and theme park
animatronics. However, to impact wider markets and to realize the potential of social robots, new
facial materials are necessary.
To overcome this essential hurdle, the author’s work advances novel materials that affect human
facial expressions more realistically, with approximately 1/20th the force required by solid elasto-
mers (see Figure 6.13). These materials are low cost, nontoxic (made of medical grade materials),
and altogether practicable for mass production.
The ﬁrst pass at the material was a urethane-based foamed elastomer which elongated approxi-
mately 500%, yet compressed like a conventional sponge or foam rubber. Dubbed ‘‘F’rubber’’ (a
contraction of ‘‘face’’ and ‘‘rubber’’), the material exhibits physical characteristics much closer to
human skin versus a solid elastomer. The cells of the material are ﬁlled with air rather than liquid,
which cause the volume of the simulated tissue to be variable, unlike the practically invariable
volume of liquid-ﬁlled facial tissues. Nevertheless, these new materials fold, wrinkle, and bunch in
ways that are highly naturalistic, much more so than can be achieved with solid elastomer. In
addition to improved verisimilitude in simulated facial expressions, this material decreases the
force requirements by an order of magnitude, enabling lower power, lower cost expressive robots,
rendering them applicable to a wider range of art and science.

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

More recently, new F’rubber material has been created out of silicone, which is softer, can
elongate 1050%, and is tolerant to a wider range of environmental conditions. Also, computer-
numeric-controlled (CNC) deposition of thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) into a designed matrix has
shown promising preliminary results, exhibiting elongation up to 1250%. The pores in such a
material need not be spherical; they can be shaped into complex manifolds for improved mechan-
ical and expressive behavior. They may even contain closed cells ﬁlled with liquid for still more
advanced expressive emulation of facial tissues. These processes are described further in Section
6.4.
These new material approaches may help to satisfy people’s discriminating taste for verisim-
ilitude. They may also enable to convey more relevant sociable perceptual patterns when deviating
from verisimilitude. Additionally, however, the novel materials may be used for nonrealistic
cartoon and animal faces, which will beneﬁt from the likeness to animal soft tissues, and the
decreased weight and energy requirements.

ROBOTIC MATERIALS, STRUCTURES, AND MANUFACTURABILITY
Robots are inherently integrated systems, and will be beneﬁciaries of the numerous bio-inspired
technologies that can be integrated into robots. Make no mistake, robots also beneﬁt from
technology advances that are not bio-inspired. Advancing manufacturing technologies, such as
MEMS and SDM, though not themselves bio-inspired, are being used to produce more lifelike
robots.
Multifunctional materials promise to make robots more effective. Single multifunctional ma-
terials, such as carbon nanotubes, offer mechanical strength and ﬂexibility, provide computation,
emit light, capture sensory data, provide electrically actuated motion (Baughman et al., 1999). If
utilized in a robot’s skin, such electroactuative polymers (EAPs) may greatly streamline a robot’s
manufacturing and cost (Bar-Cohen, 2002). Likewise, multiplicity of functions in the locomotive
systems, as may be provided by biomimetic viscoelastic mechanical compliance (Full, 1999) and
reconﬁgurable designs, can allow a robot to transit through more diverse, complex terrain.
Advanced manufacturing is leading to faster robot design, more complex yet affordable robots,
and design control at meso, micro, and nanoscales. Rapid progress is occurring in both materials
sciences (including recent advances in EAP) and manufacturing technologies on multiple scales.
The overlaps with biomimetic engineering are increasing in number impressively.
Rapid prototyping and digital design tools are enabling complex concepts to be turned into
physical objects in very short cycles. Advanced silicon manufacturing techniques, largely innov-
ated for manufacturing microprocessors, have resulted in burgeoning techniques of MEMS in
several interesting robot projects (Dickinson et al., 2000). A comprehensive list of techniques
that may be pertinent to manufacturing and prototyping entertainment robots with EAP actuators
would be prohibitively long to include here, but are covered in more detail in Chapter 18 of Bar-
Cohen (2002/2003) and Hanson et al. (2003).
Fusing several rapid prototyping technologies with mold-making and advanced materials, SDM
has been described in Full (2000) as particularly interesting for use with biorobotics. SDM uses
various computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) technologies to layer and reﬁne materials into
arbitrarily complex conﬁgurations, bonded without the use of mechanical fasteners. Actuators
and sensors can be imbedded directly into the ‘‘ﬂesh’’ of a device, composed of materials of varied
elasticity and rigidity, layered and bonded in situ. This process can achieve fully functional rapid
prototypes, as well as highly efﬁcient manufacturing procedures (Amon et al., 1996). Images of the
SDM process are shown in Figure 6.14.
SDM may be effective for MEMS microscale devices, and may be extensible to nano-devices.
The SDM process is proving decidedly useful in rubbery macroscale robots, which are simpliﬁed by
the absence of mechanical fasteners. As an example, the 15-cm (6-in.) legged robot ‘‘Sprawlita’’ at

Stanford’s SDM Rapid Prototyping Lab was shown in Figure 6.2. This SDM robot is extremely
robust, capable of receiving quite a pounding (Bailey et al., 2000). This approach promises beneﬁts
over traditional, rigid mechanical engineering — wherein systems fail from shock, friction among
parts, and fatigue — factors reduced or absent in such elastomeric devices.
In order to improve robotic facial materials, the author and White (Hanson and White, 2004)
developed a series of fabrication techniques akin to SDM, but utilizing a sacriﬁcial matrix perfused
with elastomer, to create controlled cellular pores in the elastomer. The collection of techniques is
dubbed structured porosity elastomer manufacturing (SPEM). In preliminary experiments using
these materials in robots, the materials have shown dynamic aesthetics vastly more akin to those of
the human face, while requiring only 1/20th the force to actuate relative to solid elastomers.
Emulation of human skin in appearance and properties is one of the most challenging aspects of
creating lifelike robotic faces. HER’s patent-pending ‘‘structured porosity elastomer manufactur-
ing’’ (SPEM) process results in materials that very closely approximate the properties of human
skin, in a way amenable to mass production. SPEM produces a composite elastomer material with a
controlled 3D chamber geometry. The process can produce chambers that are analogous to those in
open-cell foam. Alternately, the pores need not be spheroids and can instead be rectangular, star-
shaped, or any topology that is useful to achieve novel material properties. By implementing
hierarchical chamber sizes, SPEM can relieve localized nodes of stress accumulation in a foamlike
material, thereby increasing the overall elastic strain of the material. With this technique, the author
increased strain in a silicone SPEM foam from 280 to greater than 800% — a value that is 85% of
the solid constituent elastomer, one that enables facial expressions (Hanson and White, 2004)
(Figure 6.15). Realistic facial expressions require up to 400% strain.
Because the enhanced compression of SPEM materials more closely matches that of facial soft
tissues than do solid elastomers (Hanson and White, 2004), SPEM-based faces wrinkle and bunch
more naturalistically, as can be seen at www.human-robot.org. SPEM techniques extend the power
of SDM (Amon et al., 1996; Bailey et al., 2000; Hanson and White, 2004) and rapid prototyping
(Figure 6.16).

composite possibilities of the material, as the material transitions into nonporous solid silicone toward the left.
196
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

We seek to address remaining challenges that were identiﬁed with the use of SPEM. These
challenges include the need to ﬁnd ways to remove the sacriﬁcial matrix more effectively and
quickly. There is a need to optimize the pore structure for expressive robot faces. Also, it is
necessary to design the SPEM to interoperate with other mechanical systems, actuators and anchor
placement, and mechanical attachments such that the face moves truthfully. Once we have devel-
oped the required material and procedures, we will have to evaluate the robustness, stability, and
mechanical performance of SPEM materials.
Even more dramatically, the material requires less than 1/30th the force to compress relative to
nonporous casts of the same silicone material. In facial expression robotics, this is particularly
advantageous as all expressions both compress facial soft tissues and elongate facial soft tissues.
Figure 6.17 shows HER’s latest robot EVA, which has been rendered using several of the
silicone SPEM techniques described above. Because of the silicone SPEM, EVA requires a tiny
fraction of the force to move into facial expressions, relative to other animatronic materials. For this
reason, this robot’s 36 DOF will run for hours on four AA batteries, consuming less than 10 W
average and 40 W peak.

ing urls: http://ndeaa.jpl.nasa.gov/nasa-nde/biomimetics/Biomimetic-robot-Hanson.mov and http://
androidworld.com/HansonHead.wmv.
For widespread applicability, bio-inspired robotic materials, structures, and systems need to be
manufacturable inexpensively and in bulk quantities. The toolset for creating bio-inspired robots is
clearly maturing, though much work remains.

CONCLUSORY REMARKS
Clearly the future glows for bio-inspired robotics. Many trends are showing high degrees of
functionality, and yet are increasing rapidly in function: computational hardware, materials,
software, and mobility are examples. Yet, daunting quantities of work remain to create robots
that are as capable as animals or humans. In fact, the increasing functionality of biomimetic robots
and AI results in humbling insights regarding the complexity of the bio-systems, which let us know
how much we yet know about life.
Future work includes the improved software integration that would accelerate the functionality
of social robots and the advancement of automated design and prototyping systems for robotic
systems from macro scale facial expressions and locomotion systems, to micro scale actuation and
electronics. Additionally, the biosciences need to further discover what makes animals so effective,
and engineers need to replicate these discoveries in technology. As the economy of biorobotics
continues to expand, largely bolstered by the ongoing trends of increasing functionality, there
should be ample resources for future research in this exciting ﬁeld.

At some point if the trends continue to extremes, our biology may be difﬁcult to distinguish from
our technology, and in many ways our human identity will be challenged. As the technology
advances, it will be worthwhile to ask questions regarding the ethical employment of the technol-
ogy. Will robots, like animals and humans, be afforded rights? What happens if they become
conscious? What happens if they get smarter than us? Accelerating progress in robotics clearly
implies that these questions are migrating out of speculative ﬁction and philosophy, and into reality,
faster than many may think.

INTRODUCTION
The underlying principle of biomimetics deals with the understanding, conceptualization, and
mimicking nature’s way of handling various problems and situations. Nature has inspired mankind
for ages and has been a key source from which we can learn and adapt. Natural processes are
extremely efﬁcient in terms of energy and material usage and provide us with many inspiring and
thought provoking designs and principles. This chapter discusses biomimetics at the nano-scale,
where we talk about nanorobotics and its design principles, which are inspired by nature’s way of
doing things at that scale.
Figure 7.1 describes the biomimetics principle and details the various aspects of mimetics. It
explains the mimetics at two levels when nano-scale is considered. One is the ‘‘machine nanomi-
metics’’ principle meaning the creation of nanomachine components inspired by the equivalent
machine components at the macro-scale and the other is the ‘‘bionanomimetics’’ principle where
biological entities such as proteins and DNA are used to create the nanomachine components. The
ﬁeld of nanorobotics hence encapsulates these two mimetic principles and inherits their various
characteristics, design logic, and advantages.
Nanotechnology can best be deﬁned as a description of activities at the level of atoms and
molecules that have applications in the real world. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter, that is,
about 1/80,000 of the diameter of a human hair, or ten times the diameter of a hydrogen atom. The
size-related challenge is the ability to measure, manipulate, and assemble matter with features on
the scale of 1 to 100 nm. In order to achieve cost-effectiveness in nanotechnology, it will be
necessary to automate molecular manufacturing. The engineering of molecular products needs to be
carried out by robotic devices, which have been termed nanorobots (Freitas, 1999, 2003).
A nanorobot is essentially a controllable machine at the nanometer or molecular scale that is
composed of nano-scale components and algorithmically responds to input forces and information.

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

The ﬁeld of nanorobotics studies the design, manufacturing, programming, and control of the nano-
scale robots.
This review chapter focuses on the state of the art in the emerging ﬁeld of nanorobotics and its
applications and discusses in brief some of the essential properties and dynamical laws which make
this ﬁeld more challenging and unique than its macro-scale counterpart. This chapter is only
reviewing nano-scale robotic devices and does not include studies related to nano-precision tasks
with macro-robotic devices that usually are also included in the ﬁeld of nanorobotics (e.g., Atomic
Force Microscope (AFM) and other forms of proximal probe microscopy).
Nanorobots would constitute any active structure (nano-scale) capable of actuation, sensing,
signaling, information processing, intelligence, and swarm behavior at nano-scale. These function-
alities could be illustrated individually or in combinations by a nanorobot (swarm intelligence and
cooperative behavior). So, there could be a whole genre of actuation and sensing or information
processing nanorobots having ability to interact and inﬂuence matter at the nano-scale. Some of the
characteristic abilities that are desirable for a nanorobot to function may include:
(i)
swarm intelligence — decentralization and distributive intelligence;
(ii)
self-assembly and replication — assemblage at nano-scale and ‘‘nano-maintenance’’;
(iii)
nano-information processing and programmability — for programming and controlling nano-
robots (autonomous nanorobots);
(iv)
nano- to macro-world interface architecture — an architecture enabling instant access to the
nanorobots and its control and maintenance.
There are many differences between macro- and nano-scale robots. However, they occur mainly in
the basic laws that govern their dynamics. Macro-scaled robots are essentially in the Newtonian
mechanics domain whereas the laws governing nanorobots are in the molecular quantum mechanics
domain. Furthermore, uncertainty plays a crucial role in nanorobotic systems. The fundamental
barrier for dealing with uncertainty at the nano-scale is imposed by the quantum and the statistical
mechanics and thermal excitations. For a certain nanosystem at some particular temperature, there
are positional uncertainties that cannot be modiﬁed or further reduced (Drexler, 1992).
The nanorobots are invisible to the naked eye, which makes them hard to manipulate and work
with. Techniques like scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)
are being employed to establish a visual and haptic interface to enable us to sense the molecular
structure of these nano-scaled devices. Virtual reality (VR) techniques are currently being explored
in nano-science and biotechnology research as a way to enhance the operator’s perception (vision
and haptics) by approaching more or less a state of ‘‘full immersion’’ or ‘‘telepresence.’’ The
development of nanorobots or nanomachine components presents difﬁcult fabrication and control
challenges. Such devices will operate in microenvironments whose physical properties differ from
those encountered by conventional parts. Since these nano-scale devices have not yet been
fabricated, evaluating possible designs and control algorithms requires using theoretical estimates
and virtual interfaces or environments. Such interfaces or simulations can operate at various levels
of detail to trade-off physical accuracy, computational cost, number of components, and the time
over which the simulation follows the nano-object behaviors. They can enable nano-scientists to
extend their eyes and hands into the nano-world, and they also enable new types of exploration and
whole new classes of experiments in the biological and physical sciences. VR simulations can also
be used to develop virtual assemblies of nano and bio-nano components into mobile linkages and to
predict their performance.
Nanorobots with completely artiﬁcial components have not been realized yet. The active area of
research in this ﬁeld is focused more on molecular machines, which are thoroughly inspired by
nature’s way of doing things at nano-scale. Mother Nature has her own set of molecular machines
that have been working for millions of years, and have been optimized for performance and design
over the ages. As our knowledge and understanding of these numerous machines continues to
Bio-Nanorobotics
203

increase, we now see a possibility of using the natural machines or creating synthetic ones from
scratch using nature’s components. This chapter focuses more on molecular machines and explores
various designs and research prevalent in this ﬁeld. The main goal in the ﬁeld of molecular
machines is to use various biological elements — whose function at the cellular level creates
motion, force, or a signal — as machine components. These components perform their prepro-
grammed biological function in response to the speciﬁc physiochemical stimuli but in an artiﬁcial
setting. In this way proteins and DNA could act as motors, mechanical joints, transmission
elements, or sensors. If all these different components were assembled together in the proper
proportion and orientation, they would form nanodevices with multiple degrees of freedom, able
to apply forces and manipulate objects in the nano-scale world. The advantage of using nature’s
machine components is that they are highly efﬁcient and reliable.
Nanorobotics is a ﬁeld which calls for collaborative efforts between physicists, chemists,
biologists, computer scientists, engineers, and other specialists to work towards this common
objective. Figure 7.2 details the various ﬁelds which come under the ﬁeld of bio-nanorobotics
(this is just a representative ﬁgure and not exhaustive in nature). Currently this ﬁeld is still
developing, but several substantial steps have been taken by great researchers all over the world
who are contributing to this ever challenging and exciting ﬁeld.
The ability to manipulate matter at the nano-scale is one core application for which nanorobots
could be the technological solution. A lot has been written in the literature about the signiﬁcance
and motivation behind constructing a nanorobot. The applications range from medical to environ-
mental sensing to space and military applications. Molecular construction of complex devices could
be possible by nanorobots of the future. From precise drug delivery to repairing cells and ﬁghting
tumor cells, nanorobots are expected to revolutionize the medical industry in the future. These
applications come under the ﬁeld of nanomedicine (Freitas, 1999, 2003), which is a very active area
of research in nanotechnology. These molecular machines hence form the basic enablers of future
applications.
In the next section, we shall try to understand the principles, theory, and utility of the known
molecular machines and look into the design and control issues for their creation and modiﬁcation.
A majority of natural molecular machines are protein-based which involve using the exact replica

of nature’s mechanism, while the DNA-based molecular machines use the basic properties of DNA
to design various synthetic mechanisms (which might not be present in the nature). Nature deploys
proteins to perform various cellular tasks — from moving cargo to catalyzing reactions, while it has
kept DNA as an information carrier. It is hence understandable that most of the natural machinery is
built from proteins. With the powerful crystallographic techniques available in the modern world,
the protein structures are clearer than ever. The ever increasing computing power makes it possible
to dynamically model protein folding processes and predict the conformations and structure of
lesser known proteins (Rohl et al., 2004). All this helps unravel the mysteries associated with the
molecular machinery and paves the way for the production and application of these miniature
machines in various ﬁelds including medicine, space exploration, electronics, and military.

BIOMOLECULAR MACHINES: BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE
7.2.1
Signiﬁcance
The recent explosion of research in nanotechnology, combined with important discoveries in
molecular biology, has created a new interest in biomolecular machines and robots. The main
goal in the ﬁeld of biomolecular machines is to use various biological elements — whose function
at the cellular level creates motion, force, or a signal, or stores information — as machine
components. These components perform their preprogrammed biological function in response to
the speciﬁc physiochemical stimuli but in an artiﬁcial setting. In this way proteins and DNA could
act as motors, mechanical joints, transmission elements, or sensors. If all these different compo-
nents were assembled together in the proper proportion and orientation, they would form
nanodevices with multiple degrees of freedom, able to apply forces, and manipulate objects in
the nano-scale world. The advantage of using nature’s machine components is that they are highly
efﬁcient (Kinosita et al., 2000) and reliable. Just as conventional macro-machines are used to
generate forces and motions to accomplish speciﬁc tasks, bionanomachines can be used to ma-
nipulate nano-objects to assemble and fabricate other machines or products and to perform
maintenance, repair, and inspection operations.
Such bio-nanorobotic devices will hopefully be part of the arsenal of future medical devices and
instruments that will: (1) perform operations, inspections, and treatments of diseases inside the
body, and (2) achieve ultra-high accuracy and localization in drug delivery, thus minimizing side
effects. Figure 7.3 shows an idealized rendition of a biomolecular nanorobot repairing an infected
cell in a blood vessel. The bio-nanorobot will be able to attach to the infected cell alone and deliver
a therapeutic drug that can treat or destroy only the infected cell, sparing the surrounding healthy
cells.
Development of robotic components composed of simple biological molecules is the ﬁrst step in
the development of future biomedical nanodevices. Since the planned complex systems and devices
will be driven by these components, we must ﬁrst develop a detailed understanding of their
operation. From the simple elements such as structural links to more advanced concepts as motors,
each part must be carefully studied and manipulated to understand its functions and limits.
Figure 7.4 lists the most important components of a typical robotic system or machine assembly
and the equivalence between macro and potential bio-nano components. Beyond the initial com-
ponent characterization is the assembly of the components into robotic systems. Figure 7.5 shows
one such concept of a nano-organism, with its ‘‘feet’’ made of helical peptides and its body using
carbon nanotubes while the power unit is a biomolecular motor. For this phase to be successful, a
library of biological elements of every category must be available. At that point, conventional
robotics can be used as a guide for fabrication of bio-nanorobots that function in the same manner.
There will be systems that have mobile characteristics to transport themselves, as well as other
objects, to desired locations.
Bio-Nanorobotics
205

Some bio-nanorobots can be conceived as able to manufacture additional elements and various
structures. There may also be robots that not only perform physical labor, but also sense the
environment and react accordingly. There is no doubt that biomedical applications will be both a
driving force and a beneﬁciary of these developments.
7.2.2
Brief Review of Biomolecular Machines
While the majority of the prior research in this ﬁeld has largely focused on biomolecular motors,
several other nano components such as sensors and even assemblies of components in the form of
mechanisms have been studied. In the macroscopic world, what we understand by a ‘‘motor’’ is a
machine capable of imparting motion associated by the conversion of energy. Biomolecular motors
have attracted a lot of attention recently because: (1) they operate at high efﬁciency, (2) some could
be self-replicating and hence cheaper in mass usage, and (3) they are readily available in nature
(Boyer, 1998). A number of enzymes function as nano-scale biological motors, such as kinesin
(Block, 1998; Schnitzer and Block, 1997), RNA polymerase (Wang et al., 1998), myosin (Kitamura
et al., 1999), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, function as nano-scale biological motors
(Montemagno and Bachand, 1999; Bachand and Montemagno, 2000; Soong et al., 2000; Noji et al.,
1997; Yasuda et al., 1998; Walker, 1998).

7.2.2.1 The ATPase Motor
One of the most abundant rotary motors found in life forms is F0F1 ATP synthase, commonly known
as the ‘‘ATPase motor.’’ Oxidative phosphorylation was demonstrated over 50 years ago as an
important process by which our bodies capture energy from the food we eat. The mechanism of this
process was not known until 1997, when Boyer and Walker described the key role that ATP plays in
the process (Boyer, 1998; Walker, 1998). Noji et al. published the structural and performance data of
the ATPase motor in 1997 (Noji et al., 1997; Yasuda et al., 1998). According to this study, the g-
subunit, which is about 1 nm in diameter, rotates inside the F1 subunit, which is about 5 nm in
diameter, to produce approximately 40 pN-nm of rotary torque. Montemagno and his group were the
ﬁrst to indicate that the rotation of the g-subunit of the ATPase motor could be mechanically useful
based on fabricated nanomechanical inorganic devices, which could be compatible with the force

production and dimensions of the molecular motors (Montemagno and Bachand, 1999; Bachand
and Montemagno, 2000; Soong et al., 2000). Frasch’s group is currently studying the binding
of metals to amino acids of the motor protein. These experiments are providing new insights into
the means by which the energy obtained from the hydrolysis of ATP can be converted into the
physical action of pumping a proton in a unilateral direction (Frasch, 2000).
7.2.2.2 Kinesin and Myosin
Motor proteins are tiny vehicles that transport molecular cargoes within cells. These minute cellular
machines exist in three families: the kinesins, the myosins, and the dyneins (Farrell et al., 2002).
Conventional kinesin was found to be a highly processive motor that could take several hundred
steps on a microtubule without detaching (Block et al., 1990; Howard et al., 1989), whereas muscle
myosin has been shown to execute a single ‘‘stroke’’ and then dissociate (Finer et al., 1994).
A detailed analysis and modeling of these motors has been done (Vale and Milligan, 2000).
Hackney’s group has concentrated upon the usage of ATP energy by motors like kinesin, myosin,
dynenin, and related motor families (Hackney, 1996). Unger’s group is currently working towards
developing a microtubule–kinesin system as a biological linear-motoric actuator. Their work is
aimed at producing force multiplication by parallel action of numerous single driving units as well
as a more efﬁcient means for system control (Bohm et al., 1997). Other researchers have discovered
a new member of the myosin-V family (Myo5c) and have implicated this myosin in the transport of
a speciﬁc membrane compartment (Mehta et al., 1999). The role of ATP hydrolysis in kinesin
motility has also been recently described (Farrell et al., 2002).
7.2.2.3 The Flagella Motors
Escherichia coli and similar organisms are equipped with a set of rotary motors only 45 nm in
diameter. Each motor drives a long, thin, helical ﬁlament that extends several cell body lengths out

into the external medium. In addition to rotary engines and propellers, E. coli’s standard accessories
include particle counters, rate meters, and gearboxes and thus have been described as a nanotech-
nologist’s dream (Berg, 2000). Berg developed one of the earliest models for the rotary motor
(Berg, 1974). Improved models came in 1992 (Ueno et al., 1992, 1994). Flagella motor analysis
coupled to real-time computer assisted analysis of motion has also been performed (Khan et al.,
1998). Researchers in Japan have applied crystallographic studies in order to understand the
molecular structure of ﬂagella motors as well as that of kinesin (Namba and Vonderviszt, 1997).
Finally, Hess’ group is attempting to build a nano-scale train system, complete with tracks, loading
docks and a control system. Since motor proteins are a thousand times smaller than any man-made
motor, they aim to utilize them in a synthetic environment as engines powering the nanotrains (Hess
and Vogel, 2001).
7.2.2.4 Other Motors and Mechanisms
In addition to work on naturally existing motors, considerable effort is also being applied to
develop synthetic molecular motors. The structure of the ATP synthase, a rod rotating inside a
static wheel, suggests the use of rotaxanes as potential artiﬁcial models for natural motors (Harada,
2001). Rotaxanes are organic compounds consisting of a dumbbell-shaped component that incorp-
orates one or more recognition sites in its rod section and is terminated by bulky ‘‘stoppers,’’
encircled by one or more ring components. The possibility of manufacturing speciﬁc forms of
rotaxane and creating molecular motors capable of guided rotary motion and the possibility of
fueling such a motor by light, electrons, and chemical energy have been proposed (Schalley
et al., 2001).
Schemes for using pseudorotaxanes, rotaxanes, and catenanes as molecular switches to perform
chemical, electrochemical, and photochemical switching and controllable molecular shuttles have
also been proposed recently (Balzani et al., 1998). Molecular shuttles have been reported using
a-cyclodextrin — a parent of rotaxanes and catenanes (Harada, 2001). A light-driven monodirec-
tional rotor made of helical alkene, with rotation around a central carbon–carbon covalent bond due
to chirality has been reported (Koumura et al., 1999). Another simple way to convert chemical
energy into mechanical motion in a controlled fashion is by using a metal ion which can be
translocated reversibly between two organic compartments with the change of its ionization state,
controllable by redox reaction or pH change (Amendola et al., 2001). Motility of unicellular
organisms like vortecellids reminds us of energy storage and release by mechanical springs on a
macromolecular scale. Spring-like action has been observed in sperm cells of certain marine
invertebrates during fertilization. Springs and supramolecular ratchets by actin polymerization
have yet to be built in vitro, but they theoretically can be generalized, as recently demonstrated
(Mahadevan and Matsudaira, 2000).
7.2.2.5 DNA-Based Molecular Nanomachines, Joints, and Actuators
Several researchers are exploring the use of DNA in nano-scale mechanisms. DNA is small,
relatively simple, and homogeneous and its structure and function is well understood. The predict-
able self-assembling nature of the double helix makes it an attractive candidate for engineered
nanostructures. This property has been exploited to build several complex geometric structures,
including knots, cubes, and various polyhedra (Seeman, 1998). Mathematical analyses of the elastic
structure of DNA using energy minimization methods have been performed to examine its
molecular stability, wherein short DNA strands were treated as an elastic rod (Tobias et al.,
2000). Initial experiments on DNA visualization and manipulation using mechanical, electrical,
and chemical means have been underway for a decade (Yuqiu et al., 1992; Hu et al., 2002).
A dynamic device providing atomic displacements of 2–6 nm was proposed in Mao et al. (1999),
wherein the chemically induced transition between the B and Z DNA morphologies acts as a
Bio-Nanorobotics
209

moving nano-scale device. A method for localized element-speciﬁc motion control was seen in the
reversible transition between four stranded topoisomeric DNA motifs (PX and JX2) thereby
producing rotary motion (Yan et al., 2002). A very important, though simple DNA machine that
resembles a pair of tweezers has been successfully created, whose actuation (opening and closing)
is also fueled by adding additional DNA fuel strands (Yurke et al., 2000).
7.2.3
Nanosensors
The technology of nanosensing is also under development. For example, silicon probes with
single walled carbon nanotube (CNT) tips are being developed (MIT Media Laboratory Nanoscale
Sensing, http://www.media.mit.edu/nanoscale/). For sensing certain analytes, genetically engi-
neered versions of pore-forming proteins like Staphylococcus aureus a-hemolysin are also being
studied Braha et al., 1997. Light sensors could be made using certain photoreceptive polypeptides
containing azobenzene or spyropyran units as they respond to light or dark environmental condi-
tions by undergoing conformational change, for example, transition from random coil to a a-helix
(Pieroni et al., 2001). An optical DNA biosensor platform has been reported using etched optical
ﬁber bundles ﬁlled with oligonucleotide-functionalized microsphere probes (Ferguson et al., 1996).
Finally, work is in progress to develop sensors for brain implantation, which would foretell the
development of a stroke and be useful for perioperative online monitoring during coronary by-pass
surgery (Manning and McNeil, 2001).
In addition to many of the examples mentioned above which generally correspond to one degree
of freedom (DOF) rotary actuators, there are many other machine elements, the functional capabil-
ities of which have not yet been represented by biomolecular elements. In addition, the assembly of
different molecules in a multi-degree of freedom machine or the formation of hybrid systems
composed of biomolecules and synthetic nonorganic elements has not yet been explored. In this
context, our long term goal is to identify novel biomolecules that can be used as different types of
machine components and to assemble them into controlled multi-degree of freedom systems using
organic and synthetic nonorganic parts.
7.3
DESIGN AND CONTROL PHILOSOPHIES FOR NANOROBOTIC SYSTEMS
The design of nanorobotic systems requires the use of information from a vast variety of sciences
ranging from quantum molecular dynamics to kinematic analysis. In this chapter we assume that
the components of a nanorobot are made of biological components, such as proteins and DNA
strings. So far, no particular guideline or a prescribed manner that details the methodology of
designing a bio-nanorobot exists. There are many complexities that are associated with using
biocomponents (such as protein folding and presence of aqueous medium), but the advantages of
using these are also quite considerable. These biocomponents offer immense variety and function-
ality at a scale where creating a man-made material with such capabilities would be extremely
difﬁcult. These biocomponents have been perfected by nature through millions of years of evolu-
tion and hence these are very accurate and efﬁcient. As noted in the review section on Molecular
Machines, F1-ATPase is known to work at efﬁciencies which are close to 100%. Such efﬁciencies,
variety, and form are not existent in any other form of material found today. Another signiﬁcant
advantage in protein-based bio-nano components is the development and reﬁnement over the last
30 years of tools and techniques enabling researchers to mutate proteins in almost any way
imaginable. These mutations can consist of anything from simple amino acid side-chain
swapping, amino acid insertions or deletions, incorporation of nonnatural amino acids, and even
the combination of unrelated peptide domains into whole new structures. An excellent example of
210
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

this approach is the use of zinc to control F1-ATPase, which is able to rotate a nanopropeller in the
presence of ATP. A computational algorithm (Hellinga and Richards, 1991) was used to determine
the mutations necessary to engineer an allosteric zinc-binding site into the F1-ATPase using site-
directed mutagenesis. The mutant F1-ATPase would rotate an actin ﬁlament in the presence of ATP
with average torque of 34 pNm. This rotation could be stopped with the addition of zinc, and
restored with the addition of a chelator to remove the zinc from the allosteric binding site (Liu et al.,
2002). This type of approach can be used for the improvement of other protein-based nano
components.
These biocomponents seem to beavery logical choicefor designingnanorobots.Inaddition, since
some of the core applications of nanorobots are in the medical ﬁeld, using biocomponents for these
applications seems to be a good choice as they both offer efﬁciency and variety of functionality. This
idea is clearly inspired by nature’s construction of complex organisms such as bacteria and viruses
which arecapable ofmovement,sensing, and organizedcontrol.Hence, ourscope wouldbelimitedto
the usage of these biocomponents in the construction of bio-nanorobotics. A roadmap is proposed
which details the main steps towards the design and development of bio-nanorobots.
7.3.1
The Roadmap
The roadmap for thedevelopment of bio-nanorobotic systems for future applications (medical, space,
and military) is shown in Figure 7.6. The roadmap progresses through the following main steps:
Step 1: Bio-Nano Components
Development of bio-nano components from biological systems is the ﬁrst step towards the design
and development of an advanced bio-nanorobot, which could be used for future applications (see

Figure 7.7). Since the planned systems and devices will be composed of these components, we must
have a sound understanding of how these behave and how they could be controlled. From the simple
elements such as structural links to more advanced concepts such as motors, each component must
be carefully studied and possibly manipulated to understand the functional limits of each one of
them. DNA and carbon nanotubes are being fabricated into various shapes, enabling possibilities of
constructing newer and complex devices. These nanostructures are potential candidates for inte-
grating and housing the bio-nano components within them. Proteins such as rhodopsin and bacter-
iorhodopsin are a few examples of such bio-nano components. Both of these proteins are naturally
found in biological systems as light sensors. They can essentially be used as solar collectors to gather
abundant energy from the sun. This energy could either be harvested (in terms of proton motive
force) for later use or could be consumed immediately by other components, such as the ATP
synthase nano rotary motor. The initial work is intended to be on the biosensors, such as heat shock
factor. These sensors will form an integral part of the proposed bionano assemblies, where these will
be integrated within a nanostructure and will get activated as programmed, for gathering the
required information at the nano-scale. Tools and techniques from molecular modeling and protein
engineering will be used to design these modular components.
Step 2: Assembled Bio-Nanorobots
The next step involves the assembly of functionally stable bio-nano components into complex
assemblies. Some examples of such complex assemblies are shown in Figure 7.8. Figure 7.8A
shows a bio-nanorobot with its ‘‘feet’’ made of helical peptides and its body of CNT, while the
power unit is a biomolecular motor. Figure 7.8B shows a conceptual representation of modular
organization of a bio-nanorobot. The modular organization deﬁnes the hierarchy rules and spatial
arrangements of various modules of the bio-nanorobots, such as the inner core (the brain or energy
source for the robot), the actuation unit, the sensory unit, and the signaling and information
processing unit. By the beginning of this phase, a ‘‘library of bio-nano components’’ will be
developed, which will include various categories, such as actuation, energy source, sensory,
signaling, etc. Thereafter, one will be able to design and develop such bionanosystems that will
have enhanced mobile characteristics and will be able to transport themselves as well as other
objects to desired locations at nano-scale. Furthermore, some bio-nanorobots need to assemble
various biocomponents and nanostructures, including in situ fabrication sites and storage areas;
others will manipulate existing structures and maintain them. There will also be robots that not only
perform physical labor, but also sense the environment and react accordingly. There will be systems
that will sense an oxygen deprivation and stimulate other components to generate oxygen creating
an environment with stable homoeostasis.

Step 3: Distributive Intelligence, Programming and Control
With the individual bio-nanorobots capable of basic functions, we would now need to develop
concepts that would enable them to collaborate with one another to develop ‘‘colonies’’ of similar
nanorobots. This design step could lay the foundation towards the concept of bionanoswarms
(distributive bio-nanorobots) (see Figure 7.9A). Here work has to be done towards the control and
programming of such swarms. This will evolve concepts like distributive intelligence in the context
of bio-nanorobots. Designing swarms of bio-nanorobots capable of carrying out complex tasks and
capable of computing and collaborating amongst them will be the focus of this step. Therefore, the
basic computational architectures need to be developed and rules need to be evolved for the bio-
nanorobots to make intended decisions at the nano-scale.
To establish an interface with the macro-world, the computers and electronic hardware have to
be designed as well. Figure 7.10 shows the overall electronic communication architecture. Humans
should be able to control and monitor the behavior and action of these swarms. This means that
basic computational capabilities of the swarms will need to be developed. A representative
computational bionanocell, which will be deployed within a bio-nanorobot, is shown in Figure
7.9B. This basic computational cell will initially be designed for data retrieval and storage at the
nano-scale. This capability will enable us to program (within certain degrees of freedom) the swarm
behavior in the bio-nanorobots. We will further be able to get their sensory data (from nano-world)
back to the macro-world through these storage devices. This programming capability would control
the bio-nanorobotics system and hence is very important.
Step 4: Automatic Fabrication and Information Processing Machines
Specialized bio-nano robotic swarms would need to be designed to carry out complex missions,
such as sensing, signaling, and data storage. The next step in nanorobotic designing would see the
emergence of automatic fabrication methodologies (see Figure 7.11, which only shows the ﬂoor
concept of assembling bio-nanorobots) of such bio-nanorobots in vivo and in vitro. Capability of
information processing will be a key consideration of this step. This would enable bio-swarms to
have capability of adjusting based on their interacting environment they will be subjected to. These

swarms could be programmed for more than one energy source and hence would have an ability to
perform in an alternate environment. Energy management, self-repairing, and evolving will be
some of the characteristics of these swarms.
7.3.2
Design Architecture for the Bio-Nanorobotic Systems
(a) Modular Organization: Modular organization deﬁnes the fundamental rule and hierarchy for
constructing a bio-nano robotic system. Such construction is performed through stable integration
(energetically in the most stable state) of the individual ‘‘bio-modules or components’’, which
constitute the bio-nanorobot. For example, if the entity ABCD deﬁnes a bio-nanorobot having some
functional speciﬁcity (as per the Capability Matrix deﬁned in Table 7.1) then A, B, C, and D are said
to be the basic bio-modules deﬁning it. The basic construction will be based on the techniques of
molecular modeling with emphasis on principles such as energy minimization on the hypersurfaces

individual bio-nanorobot will deﬁne the arrangement of the swarm. These swarms could be re-programmed to
form bindings with various other types of robots. The number of robots making a swarm will be determined by
the mission. Such swarms will attach additional bio-nanorobots at run time and replace any non-functional ones.

of the bio-modules, hybrid quantum-mechanical and molecular mechanical methods, empirical
force ﬁeld methods, and maximum entropy production in least time.
Modular organization also enables the bio-nanorobots with capabilities, such as organizing into
swarms, a feature, which is extremely desirable for various applications. Figure 7.12A and
Figure 7.12B show the conceptual representation of modular organization. Figure 7.12C shows a
more realistic scenario in which all the modules are deﬁned in some particular spatial arrangements
based on their functionality and structure. A particular module could consist of other group of
modules, just like a fractal structure (deﬁned as fractal modularity). The concept of bionanocode
has been devised, which basically describes the unique functionality of a bio-nano component in

capabilities of energy storage, mechanical actuation, and signaling at the nano-scale. Such repre-
sentations will help in general classiﬁcations and representative mathematics of bio-nanorobots and

(b) The Universal Template — BioNano STEM System: The modular construction concept
involves designing a universal template for bionanosystems, which could be ‘‘programmed and
grown’’ into any possible bionanocoded system. This concept mimics the embryonic stem cells
found in the human beings, that are a kind of primitive human cells which give rise to all other
specialized tissues found in a human foetus and ultimately to all the three trillion cells in an
adult human body. Our BioNano STEM system will act in a similar way. This universal growth
template will be constituted of some basic bionanocodes, which will deﬁne the BioNano
STEM system. This STEM system will be designed in a manner that could enable it to be
programmed at runtime to any other required bio-module. Figure 7.14 shows one such variant of

SELF-REPLICATION — MIMETICS: A NOVEL PROPERTY OF LIVING SYSTEMS
7.4.1
Signiﬁcance
Mimetics of self-replication, as exhibited by nature, would inﬂuence any nano-level application.
We would need an army of nanorobots (or living systems), mass-produced via techniques of
self-replication (or life), to carry out many meaningful tasks at the nano-scale. These applications
involving nanorobots demand that these machines are manufactured in millions or billions and
in a timeframe reasonable for a particular application. One of nature’s noblest properties is
that of life. It is how nature progresses through its environment ever adapting and evolving.
Although philosophically what life means and what constitutes it is not very clear, what is clear
is how nature propagates itself with time and survives, every day and every moment! This is one
attribute of nature which is of prime importance to us as researchers of science and engineering, and
which, if understood, would bring a unique revolution that in a way would change the course of
our lives.
Figure 7.14
A variant of the initial Bio-Nano STEM system (Figure 7.12B), fabricated with enhanced bio-nano
code S, which deﬁnes it as a bio-nanorobot having enhanced sensory capabilities. The other features could be
either suppressed or enhanced depending upon the requirement at hand. The main advantage of using Bio-Nano
STEM system is that we could at runtime decide which particular type of bio-nanorobots we require for a given
situation. The suppression ability of the Bio-Nano STEM systems is due to the property of ‘‘Reversibility’’ of the
biocomponents found in living systems.
218
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

The concept of self-replicating mechanisms (SRM) or mimetics of life is not new (Freitas and
Merkle, 2004). We are perfect examples of these kinds of systems. We are wounded and our
internal mechanisms heal it with some differences in some cases. Taking the example of the wound
and its healing process, we move ahead and try to analyze how we can achieve such behaviors in the
mechanisms that we design. At the core of the concept of self-replication lies the basic material
(DNA/RNA) which undergoes such activity. Though we hardly know why these materials behave
in this fashion, what we do know is how they behave and this provides the stepping stone for us to
move ahead.
Before looking at some of the possible designs, a brief discussion on the application of such
mechanisms is necessary. Why do at all we need living systems or self-replications? Where would
they be best suited?
7.4.2
Applications
(a) Consider that our application depends upon a particular part — mechanical or electrical, or any
other physical, biological, or chemical element — which fails or starts developing problems. We
need self-rectifying mechanisms within our application to detect the problem and rectify it. It
is similar to our example of the wound. We can think of many applications where we would
desire such behavior. Given some initial material feedstock, it would be desired that the self-
replicating mechanisms would rectify the problems. Having said that, we can classify the
self-replicating mechanisms in the order we classify our main mechanisms or machines:
.
mechanical self-replicating mechanisms;
.
electrical self-replicating mechanisms;
.
chemical or biological self-replicating mechanisms.
There could be other classiﬁcations as well and numerous other examples following the lines of our
wound example, can be thought of. It just depends on our imagination. For example, suppose that
we build some SRM which mimics the living system. Its function is to detect the crucial defect in a
mechanical element and then mend that defect. If we are able to devise such an application, it could
signiﬁcantly enhance the life and performance of the system. The system in this example would be
designed and constructed to work at nano-scale, and therefore it would have an ability to detect the
slightest of defects and start working towards rectifying it.
(b) Remote Applications would also beneﬁt from SRM systems. Maintaining remote applica-
tions requires constant human interaction. If these systems mimic the coded logic and goals of the
living system, then it would be able to perform optimally with minimal human interventions. For
example, deep space explorations would require circuits, machines, and equipments to adjust and
adapt with time and as per the conditions they would be subjected to.
(c) Applications at the nano-scale. This category of applications would be most inﬂuenced by
our biomimetic systems because they could lay the foundations of nanodevices that have the
capability of manipulating molecular matter.
In the following section we try to deﬁne some of the guidelines and working philosophies for
designing and fabricating such replicating systems. The details are the thoughts and ideas of the
authors and are not veriﬁed or supported by experimental facts.
7.4.3
The Design of Life-Mimetic Systems
The design of life-mimetic systems requires new innovative materials to be designed that behave in
the same fashion as that designed by nature. These new materials are termed ‘‘intrinsic materials’’
from here on.
Bio-Nanorobotics
219

7.4.3.1 Intrinsic Material
The unique arrangement of the constituent atoms of intrinsic materials would give rise to:
.
unique potential ﬁeld surface around them;
.
unique charge distribution;
.
unique internal energy gradients.
It is through these internal energy gradients that two particular intrinsic materials would interact
with each other. Hence the behavior of the intrinsic material would be a direct function of its
internal energy gradients.
7.4.3.2 Interaction Laws
The ﬁnal objective of any interacting intrinsic materials would be to achieve the intrinsic balance of
the resulting system (termed self-balancing). This would translate to achieving minimum energy
gradients in all directions for all interacting materials. The ﬁnal system would then be deﬁned by its
new achieved internal energy gradients. These intrinsic energy gradients would also be inﬂuenced
by the external ﬁelds.
7.4.3.3 Self-Balancing
It implies that the materials considered would tend to align with its intrinsic energy gradients and
would try to minimize the formed unbalance. The classical instance of self-replication via energy-
minimized self-assembly was ﬁrst demonstrated in the late 1950s. The canonical example of this
approach is called the Penrose Blocks (Penrose and Penrose, 1957; Penrose, 1958). The unbalance
and the property of self-balancing are similar in essence to what is postulated by the law of entropy.
This concept of self-balancing is motivated from the law of maximum entropy production accord-
ing to which a system follows a path which minimizes the potential or maximizes entropy at the
maximum rate (Archives of Science, 2001).
7.4.3.4 Growth and the Reproductive Limit
An intrinsic material would have a property of growth (an important variable for replication). This
property of growth only occurs when the system is provided with some energy maybe in the form of
additional intrinsic material or external gradients. Growth cannot happen in isolation. This implies
that in the process of self-balancing, it is possible that the particular conﬁguration of the intrinsic
material is stable up to a particular level. This level would be governed by the strength of the
potential gradients for that intrinsic material and the extrinsic gradients. Therefore, the growth
implies that the intrinsic material can achieve higher state by not disturbing its self-balance or
increasing it further. But this growth can only be achieved to a particular extent; beyond it, it tends
to disintegrate by following the paths deﬁned by the laws of maximum entropy production. And this
particular limit of growth is termed Reproductive Limit.
7.4.3.5 Self-Filtering and Self-Healing
The concept of replication further demands that the materials thus designed should exhibit the
property of self-ﬁltering and self-healing. Self-ﬁltering implies that the material involved in the
systems exhibiting self-replication will not allow any kind of growth pattern but only a particular
one. This particular growth pattern (which inherently depends on the interactions of the compon-
220
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

ents) will determine which material it binds to and to which it does not. Hence such systems will
only interact with certain intrinsic materials.
In the process of this growth, a realignment of the intrinsic material occurs. As the addition of
further intrinsic material takes place, the whole system tries to realign itself towards the most stable
state and in the fastest possible time. This realignment goes on with the self-ﬁltering process. If at
any incremental stage system does not ﬁnd the kind and type of material it is looking for, it does not
realign and rejects that particular material and does not grow. By rejection, it might imply that
either the system does not align with the material or marks it as an unstable conﬁguration and seeks
for the opportunity to replace it immediately. Hence it acts as a self-healer.
7.4.4
Self-Replication — A Thought Experiment
Let us try to replicate a system, based on the above properties. Consider a system A, consisting of
some intrinsic materials (Figure 7.15). The system A is completely deﬁned by the way these
intrinsic materials are associated and aligned within it. According to the above properties of self-
replicating mechanisms, it is observed that the intrinsic materials of the system could be broken
down into further fundamental intrinsic materials.
Any stable conﬁguration of the individual intrinsic material is in sync with the property of self-
balancing. Now when a particular intrinsic material (say 1) gets in an interactive distance of another
intrinsic material (say 2), then these two intrinsic materials try to form another subsystem A1 within
the super system A, following the property of self-balancing. These two intrinsic materials com-
bined will have some other function of intrinsic energy gradient and could be the sum of the
individual intrinsic energy gradients of the intrinsic materials and the applied external ﬁelds.
Now this argument could be extended to the situation when the third intrinsic material (say 3)
comes into the picture. This intrinsic material 3 would not only interact with intrinsic material 1 but
also with intrinsic material 2. Finally, a system A comes into generation, because of self-balancing
acts of these three intrinsic materials. The conﬁguration they achieve becomes highly stable for that
particular situation. Now let us introduce more energy to the system A. It would be in the form of
introducing intrinsic materials or applying external gradients to the system A or both. Figure 7.16
explains the concept.
System A
Intrinsic Material 3
Intrinsic Material 1
Intrinsic Material 2
Figure 7.15
System of intrinsic materials — a self-replicative system A.
Bio-Nanorobotics
221

Here because of the process of self-ﬁltering, copies of intrinsic material 1, 2, and 3 are introduced.
The property of self-balancing comes into dominance and the systems try to adjust itself into the most
stable state. As deﬁned earlier, the initial state is the most stable state; following is what
happens tozthe system A. Two subsystems within the main systems are made as shown in Figure
7.17. The alignment of subsystems A1 and A2 is similar to the one of the initial system, that is, A.
Please note that such system is possible, because we can control the external parameters, namely,
Figure 7.16
Energy being added to the self-replicative system A in the form of newer intrinsic material (1, 2,
and 3) and external gradient (this external gradient is applied either to aid the interaction between the intrinsic
materials or to impart a particular dynamics to the system for favorable environment for the interaction).

Creation of stable subsystems within the original system A (which as a whole is marginally unstable
under the external gradients and two independently stable subsystems). This step is the most crucial in the process
of attaining a self-replicative super system. This demands a unique selection of such replicative intrinsic materials
in the initial place, namely, 1, 2, and 3.
222
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

extrinsic gradients and the intrinsic material introduced. The triangles drawn in the ﬁgure above show
the conﬁguration of the intrinsic materials of subsystems A1 and A2. The dotted lines depict the
interaction between the old intrinsic materials and the new ones and the possible conﬁguration that
could be achieved. Now because the external gradients are still applicable a unique instability in the
system occurs. The system tries to self-balance and in the process leads to its most stable conﬁgur-
ations, which was its initial one (the initial conﬁguration, system A).Figure 7.18 explains the concept.
In the end, the original system A replicates into systems B and C. Both these new systems have
the same functionalities as deﬁned by the original system A, because they have received the same
conﬁguration and the same intrinsic materials.
7.4.5
Design Parameters for Self-Replicating Systems
Following are the various design parameters that need to be considered while designing a self-
replicating system.
7.4.5.1 Selection of Intrinsic Materials
This is, of course, the most important parameter in designing the desired system. The obvious
choices would be biomaterials and chemicals found in the human body, which have exhibited self-
replication. Their choice is mainly because of their availability and the fact that they themselves are
the materials resulting from a replicative process. This does not limit the selection of other
replicative materials. Also a lot of data on nature’s biomaterials is available from the experiments
performed in the ﬁeld of biology and genetic engineering. The ﬁeld of nanotechnology is the
biggest area where the concept of self-replication system would be a success and the biomaterials
could be managed at that scale.
7.4.5.2 Deﬁning the External Gradient Parameters
It is extremely important to deﬁne the external gradient parameters within which the system needs
to perform. Our choice of the intrinsic materials would be greatly impacted by their behavior. Also
their sensitivities to these external gradients need to be calculated so as to ﬁne tune the system.
External
Gradients

called the child systems are similar to system A in function and its conﬁgurations.
Bio-Nanorobotics
223

7.4.5.3 Generating Stable Alignment and Internal Gradients
Selection of the appropriate intrinsic materials for our system implies that we need to also select the
appropriate internal gradient functions and the alignment generated by these intrinsic materials. We
need to calculate the most stable conﬁguration for our system at no external gradient level and then
ﬁne tune our alignment as it is applied. Application of these external gradients could generate a
situation where no stable conﬁguration is possible within our operating conditions. This calls for
adding some further intrinsic materials to the system, which would help us to get to the stable
conﬁguration (closure engineering) (Freitas and Merkle, 2004). This variation of the intrinsic
gradient in this manner is termed as intrinsic variational gradients to distinguish it from the
inherent intrinsic gradients generated due to the intrinsic materials.
The parameters mentioned above create the foundation for the development of mathematics for
this ﬁeld. To create any system with self-replicating mechanism we need to ﬁrst ﬁnd out its most
stable state, then we need to calculate its behavior in the extrinsic gradients and then we need to excite
it with energy and supply of intrinsic materials so that it replicates. Though these methodologies are
not veriﬁed, further research in this area is being carried on by the authors and their collaborators.
7.5
CONCLUSIONS
Biomimetics and its principles would greatly inﬂuence the ﬁeld of nanorobotics and nanotechnol-
ogy. The way nature is designed and the way nature solves its problems is of great interest to us
because they allow us to understand basic principles that would pave the way to practical
nanotechnology.
The recent explosion of research in nanotechnology, combined with important discoveries in
molecular biology, has created a new interest in bio-nanorobotic systems. The preliminary goal
in this ﬁeld is to use various biological elements — whose function at the cellular level results
in a motion, force or signal — as nanorobotic components that perform the same function in response
to the same stimuli — but in an artiﬁcial setting. This way proteins and DNA could act as motors,
mechanical joints, transmission elements, or sensors. Assembled together, these components would
form nanorobots with multiple degrees of freedom, with the ability to apply forces and manipulate
objects at the nano-scale, and transfer information from the nano- to the macro-scale world.
The ﬁrst research area is in determining the structure, behavior, and properties of basic bio-nano
components such as proteins. Speciﬁc problems include the precise mechanisms involved in
molecular motors like ATP Synthase, and of protein folding. The next step is combining these
components into complex assemblies. Next concepts in control and communication in swarms need
to be worked out. Again, we plan to follow nature’s path, mimicking the various colonies of insects
and animals, and transforming principles learned to our domain. Since it would require specialized
colonies of nanorobots to accomplish particular tasks, the concepts of cooperative behavior and
distributed intelligence need to be developed, possibly by using known hierarchical and other
techniques.
Principles like self-replication are the ones of greatest importance for the ﬁeld of nanorobotics.
It is this life mimetics which will enable us to design and fabricate the future nanorobots having
immense capabilities and potential. These would require innovative materials (intrinsic materials)
and fabrication methodologies, with due regard to well-known manufacturing- and applications-
related safety concerns. The safety issue is of paramount importance in this ﬁeld for researchers and
scientists. The proposed bio-nanorobots would be completely controlled molecular devices and are
far from being dangerous to society. Though these devices would have many unique capabilities,
which are not seen currently, they are harmful as projected in science ﬁction movies and books.
There is an increasing need for educating the community about the exact nature of this research and
its essential differences with the projections of the science ﬁction community.

8.1
DESIGN, SYNTHESIS, AND FABRICATION OF BIOLOGICAL
AND NANO-MATERIALS AT THE MOLECULAR SCALE
Nature is the grandmaster when it comes to building extraordinary materials and molecular
machines — one atom and one molecule at a time. Masterworks include such materials as
minerals, well-ordered clays, and photonic crystals, and in the biological world, composites
of inorganic or organic shells, pearls, corals, bones, teeth, wood, silk, horn, collagen, muscle
ﬁbers, and extracellular matrices. Multifunctional macromolecular assemblies in biology, such as
hemoglobin, polymerases, ATP synthase, membrane channels, the splicesome, the proteosome,
ribosomes, and photosystems are all essentially exquisitely designed molecular machines
(Table 8.1).
Through billions of years of prebiotic molecular selection and evolution, Nature has produced a
basic set of molecules that includes 20 amino acids, a few nucleotides, a dozen or so lipid molecules,
and a few dozens of sugars as well as naturally modiﬁed building blocks or metabolic intermediates.
229

With these seemingly simple molecules, natural processes are capable of fashioning an enormously
diverse range of fabrication units, which can further self-organize into reﬁned structures, materials
and molecular machines that not only have high precision, ﬂexibility, and error correction, but also
are self-sustaining and evolving.
Indeed, Nature shows a highly-ﬂavored bottom-up design, building up molecular assemblies, bit
by bit, more or less simultaneously on a well-deﬁned scaffold. Take for example egg formation
in oviparous animals. The fabrication of an egg involves not only the creation of the ovum, its
various protective membranes, and accompanying nutritive materials (e.g., yolk) but also simul-
taneous synthesis of the eggshell from an extremely low concentration of calcium and other
minerals, all in a very limited space. Oviparous animals synthesize eggshell against an enormous
ionic and molecular concentration gradient due to the high levels of minerals at the site of eggshell
assembly. Dental tissue formations face similar challenges not only when sharks repeatedly form
new teeth, but also when humans form teeth during early childhood.
Nature accomplishes these feats effortlessly, yet recreating them in the laboratory presents an
enormous challenge to the human engineer. The sophistication and success of natural bottom-up
fabrication processes inspire our attempts to mimic these phenomena with the aim of creating new
and varied structures, with novel utilities well beyond the gifts of Nature.
8.1.1
Two Distinctive and Complementary Fabrication Technologies
Two distinctive and complementary fabrication technologies are employed in the production of
materials and tools. In the ‘‘top-down’’ approach, materials and tools are manufactured by stripping
down an entity into its parts, for example, carving a boat from a tree trunk. This contrasts sharply
with the ‘‘bottom-up’’ approach, in which materials and tools are assembled part by part to produce
supra-structures, for example, building a ship using wooden strips (Figure 8.1) and complex
architectures, construction of a building complex. The bottom-up approach is likely to become
an integral part of materials manufacture in the coming decades. This approach requires a deep
understanding of individual molecular building blocks, their structures, assembling properties, and
dynamic behaviors. Two key elements in molecular material manufacture are chemical comple-
mentarity and structural compatibility, both of which confer the weak and noncovalent interactions
that bind building blocks together during self-assembly. Following nature’s leads, signiﬁcant
advances have been made at the interface of materials, chemistry and biology, including the design
of helical ribbons, peptide nanoﬁber scaffolds for three-dimensional cell cultures and tissue
engineering, peptide surfactants, peptide detergents for solubilizing, stabilizing, and crystallizing
diverse types of membrane proteins and their complexes.

8.2
NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY THROUGH MOLECULAR
SELF-ASSEMBLY AS A FABRICATION TOOL
Design of molecular biological materials requires detailed structural knowledge to build advanced
materials and complex systems. Using basic biological building blocks and a large number of
diverse peptide structural motifs (Branden and Tooze, 1999; Petsko and Ringe, 2003), it is possible
to build new materials from bottom-up.
One of the approaches is through molecular self-assembly using these construction units (Bran-
den and Tooze, 1999; Petsko and Ringe, 2003). Molecular self-assembly is ubiquitous in nature,
from lipids (that form oil droplets in water) and surfactants (that form micelles and other complex
structures in water) to sophisticated multiunit ribosome and virus assemblies. Molecular self-
assembly has recently emerged as a new approach in chemical synthesis and materials
fabrication in polymer science, nanotechnology, nanobiotechnology, and various other engineering
pursuits. Molecular self-assembly systems lie at the interface of molecular and structural biology,
protein science, chemistry, polymer science, materials science, and engineering. Many self-assem-
bling systems have been developed. These systems range from organic supramolecular systems, bi-,
tri-block copolymers (Lehn, 1995), and complex DNA structures (Seeman, 2003, 2004), simple and
complex proteins (Petka et al., 1998; Nowak et al., 2002; Schneider et al., 2002) to peptides (Aggeli
et al., 2001; Hartgerink et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 1993, 1995, 2002; Zhang, 2003). Molecular self-
assembly systems represent a signiﬁcant advance in the molecular engineering of simple molecular
building blocks for a wide range of material and device applications.
8.3
BASIC ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES FOR MICRO- AND NANO-FABRICATION
BASED ON MOLECULAR SELF-ASSEMBLY PHENOMENA
Programmed assembly and self-assembly are ubiquitous in nature at both macroscopic and micro-
scopic scales. The ancient Great Wall of China, the Pyramids of Egypt, the schools of ﬁsh in the
ocean, ﬂocks of birds in the sky, herds of wild animals on land, protein folding and oil droplets on
water are all such examples. Programmed assembly describes predetermined planned structures. On
the other hand, self-assembly describes the spontaneous association of numerous individual entities
into a coherent organization and well-deﬁned structures to maximize the beneﬁt of the individual
without external instruction (Figure 8.2).
Just like the construction of a wall, a house, or a building, many other parts of structures can
be prefabricated and program assembled according to architectural plans (Figure 8.3). If we shrink
Figure 8.1
Two distinctive and complementary fabrication technologies: Top-down vs. bottom-up. In the top-
down approach, the boat is limited by the size of the tree. On the other hand, the bottom-up approach, the boat is
built with smaller parts of the tree. There is no size limit to the boat for which parts are used to build it.

construction units by many orders of magnitude into nano-scale, such as structurally well-ordered
protein fragments, or peptides (Fields, 1999; Yu et al., 1997), we can apply similar principles to
construct molecular materials and devices, through molecular self-assembly and programmed
molecular assembly. This ﬁeld is growing at a rapid pace and it is impossible to summarize all
aspects of the work being done by others in this limited space, and hence this chapter focuses on
a few examples especially from the author’s laboratory.
In this chapter, two distinct classes of self-assembling peptide construction motifs are described
(Figure 8.4). The ﬁrst class belongs to amphiphilic peptidesthat form well-ordered nanoﬁbers (Zhang
et al., 1993, 1995). The ﬁrst member of such self-assembling peptides, EAK16, was discovered in a
segment fromyeastprotein,zuotin(Zhang etal.,1992).Thesepeptideshavetwodistinctivesides,one
hydrophobic and the other hydrophilic. The hydrophobic side forms a double sheet within the ﬁber
and hydrophilic side the outside of the nanoﬁbers that interact with water molecules. The hydrophilic
side can form extremelyhigh water content hydrogel,containing as high as 99.9% water similar as the
water content of a jhellyﬁsh. At least three types of molecules can be made, with , þ, /þ on the

hydrophilic side (Zhang and Altman, 1999; Zhang, 2002). The second class of self-assembling
peptide belongs to a surfactant-like molecule (Vauthey et al., 2002; Santoso et al., 2002; von
Maltzahn et al., 2003). These peptides have a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail, much like
lipids or detergents. They sequester their hydrophobic tail inside of micelle, vesicles or nanotube
structures and expose their hydrophilic heads to water. As in the previous case, at least three kinds of
molecules can be made, with , þ, /þ heads.
The ﬁrst class includes: ‘‘Peptide Lego’’ that forms well-ordered nanoﬁber scaffolds and can be
used not only for 3-D tissue cell culture but also for regenerative medicine, namely to promote
healing and replacing damaged tissues. The second class includes peptide surfactants and deter-
gents that can be used not only for drug, protein and gene deliveries, but also for solubilizing,
stabilizing, and crystallizing membrane proteins. Membrane proteins are crucial for biological
energy conversations, cell–cell communications, speciﬁc ion channels and pumps including our
senses, sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and temperature sensing.
Like bricks and architectural construction units, these designed peptide construction motifs are
structurally simple, versatile for a wide spectrum of applications.
8.4
CHEMICAL COMPLEMENTARITY AND STRUCTURAL COMPATIBILITY
THROUGH NONCOVALENT WEAK INTERACTIONS
Molecular self-assembly, by deﬁnition, is the spontaneous organization of numerous molecules
under thermodynamic and kinetic conditions into structurally well-deﬁned and rather stable
arrangements through a number of noncovalent interactions. These molecules undergo self-asso-
ciation forming hierarchical structures. The ribosome is one of the most sophisticated molecular
machines nature has ever remarkably self-assembled (Figure 8.5). It has more than 50 different
kinds of proteins and 3 different size and functional RNAs, all through weak interactions to form
the remarkable assembly line (Stillman, 2002). The other molecular machines include the photo-
systems I and II that collect photos to convert into electrons in order to produce energy needed for
nearly all living systems on Earth (Barber, 1992).
Molecular self-assembly is mediated by weak, noncovalent bonds — notably hydrogen bonds,
ionic bonds (electrostatic interactions or salt bridges), hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals
interactions, and water-mediated hydrogen bonds. Although these bonds are relatively insigniﬁcant
in isolation, when combined together as a whole, they govern the structural conformation of all
biological macromolecules and inﬂuence their interaction with other molecules (Pauling, 1960).
The water-mediated hydrogen bond is especially important for living systems as all biological
materials interact with water (Ball, 2001).
Figure 8.4 (See color insert following page 302)
Two distinct classes of self-assembling peptide construction
motifs are shown here. (a) The ﬁrst class belongs to amphiphilic peptides that form well-ordered nanoﬁbers. These
peptides have two distinctive sides, one hydrophobic and the other hydrophilic. The hydrophobic side forms a double
sheet inside of the ﬁber and hydrophilic side forms the outside of the nanoﬁbers that interact with water molecules
and they can form extremely high water content hydrogel, containing as high as 99.9% water. At least three types of
molecules can be made, with , þ, /þ on the hydrophilic side. (b) The second class of self-assembling peptide
belongs to surfactant-like molecules. These peptides have a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail, much like lipids
or detergents. They sequester their hydrophobic tail inside of micelle, vesicles or nanotube structures and expose
their hydrophilic heads to water. At least three kinds of molecules can be made, with , þ, /þ heads.

These weak interactions promote the assembly of molecules into units of well-deﬁned and stable
hierarchical macroscopic structures. Although each of the bonds or interaction is rather weak, the
collective interactions can result in very stable structures and materials. The key elements in
molecular self-assembly are chemical complementarity and structural compatibility. Like hands
and gloves, both the size or shape and the correct orientation, that is chirality, are important in order
to have a complementary and compatible ﬁtting (Schnur, 1993).
The key engineering principle for molecular self-assembly is to artfully design the molecular
building blocks that are able to undergo spontaneously stepwise ﬁne-tuned interactions and
assemblies through the formations of numerous noncovalent week chemical bonds.

SELF-ASSEMBLING SYSTEMS — MODELS TO STUDY MOLECULAR
ANTENNA FOR PROGRAMMED ASSEMBLY, SURFACE ENGINEERING,
AND FABRICATION OF NANOSCAFFOLD TO NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY
8.5.1
Fabricating Nanowires using Bioscaffolds
In the computing industry, the fabrication of nanowires and nanofeatures using the ‘‘top-down’’
approach increasingly faces tremendous challenges. Thus, the possibility of molecular fabrication
of conducting nanowires using DNA (Braun et al., 1998; Keren et al., 2003) peptides and protein
scaffolds is of particular interest to electronics industry. One can readily envision that nanotubes,
nanoﬁbers, actin ﬁlaments, yeast prion nanoﬁbers made from self-assembling peptides and proteins
may serve as templates for metallization (Djalali et al., 2002; Scheibel et al., 2003; Reches and
Gazit, 2003; Mao et al., 2003). Once the organic scaffold is removed, a pure conducting wire is left-
behind and immobilized on a surface. There is great interest in developing various methods for
attaching conducting metal nanocrystals to DNA, peptides, and proteins for such a purpose.
Furthermore, the coupled DNA, peptides and proteins may not only respond to electronic
signals but may also be used as antennae for a wide range of applications including to study
detailed molecular interactions and fabricate miniature devices (Hamad-Schifferli et al., 2002;
Sung et al., 2004).
8.5.2
Molecular Ink and Nanometer Coatings on Surfaces
Molecular assembly can be targeted to alter the chemical and physical properties of a material’s
surface (Whitesides et al., 1991; Mrksich and Whitesides, 1996; Whitesides and Grzybowski,
2002). Surface coatings instantly alter a material’s texture, color, compatibility with, and respon-
siveness to the environment. Conventional coating technology is typically accomplished through
Figure 8.5 (See color insert following page 302)
The bacterial ribosome. 30S ribosome (left panel) and 50S
ribosome (right panel). The ribosome is one of the most sophisticated molecular machines nature has ever self-
assembled. It has more than 50 different kinds of proteins and 3 different size and functional RNAs, all through weak
interactions to form the remarkable assembly line. (Source: http://www.molgen.mpg.de/~ag_ribo/ag_franceschi/.)

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

painting or electroplating. These coatings are usually in the tens and hundreds micron range and the
interface is often not complementary at the molecular level. Thus, erosion is common.
We have developed a class of biologically active molecular ink (Figure 8.6), self-assembling
peptides with linkers that anchor on surfaces (Zhang et al., 1999). In conjunction with self-assembled
monolayers prepared through microcontact printing, we can place molecules (nanometer scale) and
cells (micron scale) into complex patterns. This approach may facilitate research into detail mo-
lecular interactions and cell–cell communication. Recently, we have moved one step further: using
peptides and proteins as ink, we have directly microprinted speciﬁc features onto the nonadhesive
surface of polyethylene glycol to fabricate any arbitrary patterns rapidly without preparing a mask or
stamps. The process is similar to using an ink pen for writing — here, the microprinting device is the
pen and the biological or chemical substances are the inks (Sanjana and Fuller, 2004).
8.5.3
Nanoﬁber Peptide and Protein Scaffolds
We have also focused on fabricating three-dimensional peptide scaffolds using the self-assembling
peptides (Figure 8.7) by exposing them to a salt solution or to physiological media that accelerate
the formation of macroscopic structures (Zhang et al., 1993, 1995; Holmes et al., 2000). Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), transmission EM (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Marini
et al., 2002) reveal that the matrices formed are made of interwoven nanoﬁbers having a diameter of
~10 nm and pores of ~5 to 200 nm in size. If the alanines are changed to more hydrophobic residues,
such as valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, or tyrosine, the molecules have a greater
tendency to self-assemble and form peptide matrices. These simple, deﬁned and tailor-made self-
assembling peptides have provided the ﬁrst de novo designed scaffolds for three-dimensional cell
culture, with potential implications for basic studies of cell growth and applied studies in tissue
engineering and ultimately regenerative medicine (Kisiday et al., 2002; Zhang, 2004).

linker that can be directly anchored on surface (Top). The molecular ink was used to print speciﬁc patterns for cells
and neurons (Bottom). The MIT letters are ~400 mm tall.
Molecular Design of Biological and Nano-Materials

We have shown that a variety of tissue cells encapsulated and grown in three-dimensional
peptide scaffolds exhibit interesting functional cellular behaviors, including proliferation, func-
tional differentiation, active migration, and extensive production of their own extracellular
matrices (Kisiday et al., 2002; Zhang, 2003, 2004). When primary rat hippocampal neuron cells
are allowed to attach to the peptide scaffolds, the neuron cells not only project lengthy axons that
follow the contours of the scaffold surface, but also form active and functional synaptic connections
(Figure 8.8). (Holmes et al., 2000). Furthermore, when the peptide scaffold was injected into brain
of animals, it bridged the gap and facilitated the neural cells to migrate across the deep canyon. The
animals regained their visual function. Without the peptide scaffold, the gap remains, and
the animals did not regain visual function (Ellis-Behnke et al., unpublished results).
8.5.4 Designer Peptide Surfactants or Detergents
We designed another new class of peptide surfactants or detergents with short hydrophobic tail and
hydrophilic head (see Figure 8.4, lower panel), taking advantage of the self-assembly properties in
water (Vauthey et al., 2002; Santoso et al., 2002; von Maltzahn et al., 2003). Several peptide
surfactants have been designed using the nature lipid as a guide. These peptides have a hydrophobic
tail with various degrees of hydrophobicity and a hydrophilic head, either negatively charged
aspartic and glutamic acids or positively charged lysine or histidine (Figure 8.9). These peptide
monomers contain 7 to 8 amino acid residues and have a hydrophilic head composed of aspartic
acid and a tail of hydrophobic amino acids such as alanine, valine, or leucine. The length of each
peptide is approximately 2 nm, similar to that of biological phospholipids (Vauthey et al., 2002;
Santoso et al., 2002; von Maltzahn et al., 2003). The length can also be varied by adding more
amino acid, one at a time to a desired length as shown in Figure 8.9.
Although individually these peptide surfactants or detergents have completely different com-
positions and sequences, these peptides share a common feature: the hydrophilic heads have 1 to
2 charged amino acids and the hydrophobic tails have four or more consecutive hydrophobic amino
acids. For example, A6D (AAAAAAD), V6D (VVVVVVD) peptide has six hydrophobic alanine or
valine residues at the N-terminus followed by a negatively charged aspartic acid residue, thus having
two negative charges, one from the side chain and the other from the C terminus; likewise, G8DD
(GGGGGGGGDD), has eight glycines followed by two asparatic acids with three negative charges.
In contrast, KV6 (KVVVVVV) and V6K (VVVVVVK) have one positively charged lysine as the
Figure 8.7
The individual self-assembling peptide molecules are 5 nm long (left). The ﬁrst such peptide, EAK16-
II, was discovered from a yeast protein, zuotin (Zhang et al., 1992). This peptide inspired us to design a large class
of self-assembling peptide construction motifs. Upon dissolving in water in the presence of salt, they spontaneously
assemble into well-ordered nanoﬁbers, further into scaffolds. The AFM image of peptide RAD16-I nanoﬁbers and
PuraMatrix scaffold is shown (right).

Figure 8.8 (See color insert following page 302)
When primary rat hippocampal neuron cells are allowed to
attach to the peptide scaffolds, the neuron cells not only project lengthy axons that follow the contours of the
scaffold surface, but also form active and functional synaptic connections, each green dot is a functional neuronal
connection (upper panel). Furthermore, when the peptide scaffold was injected into brain of animals, it bridged the
gap and facilitated the neural cells to migrate across the deep canyon (lower panel). The animals regained their
visual function. Without the peptide scaffold, the gap remains, and the animals did not regain visual function.

A few of the self-assembling peptide surfactant or detergent molecules are modeled here. These
peptides have a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail, much like lipids or detergents. They sequester their
hydrophobic tail inside of micelle, vesicles or nanotube structures and their hydrophilic heads expose to water. At
least three kinds of molecules have been made, with , þ, /þ heads.

hydrophilic head and six valines as the hydrophobic tail. Leucine and isoleucines are also used as
tails. Positively charged lysine and histidine and negatively charged aspartic acid and glutamic acids
have also been used as heads. (Vauthey et al., 2002; Santoso et al., 2002; von Maltzahn et al., 2003).
These peptides undergo self-assembly in water to form nanotubes and nanovesicles having an
average diameter of 30 to 50 nm (Vauthey et al., 2002; Santoso et al., 2002; von Maltzahn et al.,
2003). The tails consisting of alanines and valines produce more homogeneous and stable structures
than those of glycines, isoleucine, and leucine. This property may be due to their hydrophobic and
hydrophilic ratios. These monomer surfactant peptides were used for molecular modeling. The
negatively charged aspartic acid is modeled as red and positively lysine is blue with the green as the
hydrophobic tails.
Quick-freeze or deep-etch sample preparation where the sample is instantly ﬂash-frozen below
1908C produced a 3-D structure with minimal structural disturbance. Using transmission electron
microscopy, it revealed a network of open-ended nanotubes with three-way junction to connect the
nanotubes (Figure 8.10) (Vauthey et al., 2002; Santoso et al., 2002; von Maltzahn et al., 2003).
They seem to be dynamic molecular entities overtime. Likewise, A6K cationic peptide also

exhibited similar nanotube structures with the opening ends clearly visible. The wall of the tube has
been determined by neutron scattering as ~5 nm, suggestive of a bi-layer structure modeled here.
It is interesting that these simple peptides surfactants can produce remarkable complex and
dynamic structures. This is another example to build materials from the bottom-up.
One may ask how could these simple peptide detergents form such well-ordered nanotubes and
nanovesicles? The answer may lie in the molecular and chemical similarities between lipids and the
peptides since both have a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail. Organic detergents have been well
studied over last few decades. The key lies in the molecular packing. However, the packing between
lipids and peptides is likely to be quite different. In lipids, the hydrophobic tails pack tightly against
each other to completely displace water, without formation of hydrogen bonds at all. On the other hand,
in addition to hydrophobic tail packing between the amino acid side chains, peptide detergents also
interact through intermolecular hydrogen bonds along the backbone. Some of these peptide detergents
displayed typical beta-sheet structures, implying the backbone extended. Thus, the tails are likely
packed in the beta-sheet form with certain curvature due to the repulsion charged heads.

PEPTIDE DETERGENTS STABILIZE MEMBRANE PROTEINS AND COMPLEXES
Many grand challenges remain in the postgenomic era, one of which is the fundamental understand-
ing of membrane biology, namely, the study of the structure and function of membrane proteins, and
speciﬁcally, the elucidation of high-resolution structures of integral membrane proteins.
Nearly all cellular signal transduction cascades occur through membrane proteins (Brann, 1992;
Haga et al., 1999; Wess, 1999). All our senses including sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch, and
temperature sensing, use membrane proteins for us to communicate with the external world. Many
important drugs used as human therapeutics act through their interaction with membrane proteins. Yet,
despite much effort in last few decades, very little is known about the intricacies and function of many
membrane proteins. Thus, meticulous and systematic determination of high-resolution membrane
protein structure will not only further our understanding of proteins as a whole, but will also enhance
our knowledge of signal transduction and accelerate development of ultra-sensitive sensing devices.
Although membrane proteins are composed of approximately one-third of total cellular
proteins (Wallin and von Heijne, 1998; Loll, 2003) and carry out some of the most important
functions in cells, only ~170 membrane protein structures have been elucidated. This is in
sharp contrast to over 30,000 nonmembrane protein structures that have been solved (http://
www.rcsb.org/pdb/). The main reason for this delay is difﬁculty to purify and crystallize membrane
proteins because removal of lipids from membrane proteins affects protein solubility and conform-
ation stability. Despite a variety of detergents and lipids as surfactants being used to facilitate,
solubilize, stabilize, purify, crystallize, and manipulate the membrane proteins for over the several
decades, how detergents interact with membrane protein to impact its structure and functions and
how to choose good detergents for the right membrane proteins remain largely unknown. This is
partly due to complexity of membrane protein–detergent–lipid interactions and lack of ‘‘magic
material’’ detergents. Therefore, the need to develop new material is urgent.
Recent experiments show that these peptide detergents are excellent materials for solubilizing,
stabilizing (Kiley et al., 2005), and crystallizing several classes of diverse membrane proteins
(Figure 8.11). These simply designed peptide detergents may now open a new avenue to overcome
one of the biggest challenges in biology — to obtain large number of high-resolution structures of
membrane proteins.
Study of the membrane proteins will not only enrich and deepen our knowledge of how cells
communicate with their surroundings since all living systems respond to their environments, but
these membrane proteins can also be used to fabricate the most advanced molecular devices, from
energy harness devices, extremely sensitive sensors to medical detection devices, we cannot now
even imagine. Following nature’s lead, as the late legendary Francis Crick best put it: ‘‘You should
always ask questions, the bigger the better. If you ask big questions, you get big answers.’’

INTRODUCTION
Muscle tissue mechanical actuators have evolved over millions of years within animals as nature’s
premier living generators of force, work, and power. The unparalleled efﬁciency and plasticity of
form of living muscles arise from the properties of biomolecular motors. Muscle cells serve to self-
organize, maintain and repair, and control the mechanical actions of large arrays of biomolecular
motors. Muscle tissues provide the chemomechanical interface between muscle cells and the
environment. It is at the tissue level that muscle becomes a practical, responsive, and robust
actuator because of the presence of the critical tissue interfaces: the neuromuscular interface, the
myotendinous junction (MTJ), and the vascular bed. Tendon tissue is an extension of the muscle
extracellular matrix (ECM) and muscle tendon junctions at the end of each muscle ﬁber.
The mechanical structures that make up this transition from muscle to tendon are critical for the
transduction of force, work, and power between muscle tissue and the external environment.
Systematic derangements of these structures at any level result in severe and sometimes lethal
disease resulting from the impairment of the contractility of skeletal muscle and the increased
susceptibility to contraction-induced injury.
A detailed description of the biology of muscle development and morphology is beyond the
scope of this chapter. The interested reader is referred to the deﬁnitive text on this subject: Myology
(Volume I, Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4, Engel and Armstrong, eds., 1994, McGraw-Hill).
Embedded within the genetic code of naturally occurring muscles lies the potential to build
mechanical actuators that are adaptable, self-healing smart materials (with integrated sensors for
position, force, and velocity) from the submillimeter to meter size scale in the form of tubes, rods,
sheets, hollow spheres, cones, and many other physical conﬁgurations. The key to engineering
efﬁcient, robust, and practical muscle actuators lies in understanding the mechanisms by which to
control muscle phenotype, that is, the size, shape, ﬁber type, and architecture of the muscle tissue
itself. The environmental signals that control muscle phenotype are mediated by the tissue
interfaces, and thus it is critical to understand, and to ultimately engineer, adequate tissue interfaces
for muscle actuators.
There are four basic approaches (classes) to engineering functional living muscle actuators: the
use of whole surgically explanted muscles, recellularized muscle within a muscle-derived ECM,
scaffold-based engineered muscle, and self-organized muscle tissue engineered culture. When
considering muscle tissue as a functional element in an engineered system it is important to
formulate well-deﬁned quantitative Figures of Merit (FoM). It is also important to note that at
the time of this writing, practical living muscle actuators are an as-yet unachieved research

objective. The remainder of this chapter will discuss many of the reasons why living muscle is being
given serious consideration for use as a mechanical actuator in hybrid robotic systems, as well as
the many special considerations involved when attempting to employ living actuators in
an engineered biohybrid system. The incorporation of functional living elements into otherwise
synthetic engineered systems is called biomechatronics.
9.2
SYSTEMS ENGINEERING OF LIVING MUSCLE ACTUATORS
Tissue engineering of skeletal muscle could be broadly deﬁned to include any alteration to or
enhancement of the musculature of a living organism. This deﬁnition, though interesting, would not
be speciﬁc enough to be useful, as it would include the agricultural use of steroids to rapidly
increase the total lean body mass of livestock, the use of resistance training by athletes to induce
hypertrophy, and surgical procedures including transplants and ﬂaps in which preexisting
skeletal muscle is modiﬁed and utilized in clinically relevant procedures (including graciloplasty,
cardiomyoplasty, and musculoskeletal reconstructive surgery). Though all of these approaches to
the modiﬁcation and use of skeletal muscle are of interest, this chapter will only address skeletal
muscle tissue engineering to generate functional muscle tissues actuators.
Successful tissue engineering must include a focus on the organization of large numbers of cells
into higher-order structures that confer emergent properties, which are an important aspect of the
tissue-level function. Thus, the engineering of functional tissues is by deﬁnition within the domain
of ‘‘systems engineering.’’ These living structures may be known as tissues or organs depending on
the level of anatomical complexity and structural integration. Though all tissue functions arise from
fundamental cellular mechanisms, the organization of tissues and organs confers function that is not
possible to achieve with individual cells or masses of unorganized cells in a scaffold. By analogy, a
pile of bricks does not provide the functionality of a house, nor does a crate full of car parts function
as an automobile. Furthermore, when removed from an organism, muscle tissue in general does not
persist for long periods. Isolated from its proper environment, muscle tissue tends to degenerate
rapidly. The environment that is required to maintain healthy, adult phenotype muscle is highly
complex and incompletely understood, involving many chemical, structural, and mechanical
signals. In order to understand both natural and tissue-engineered skeletal muscle, we must have
a clear working deﬁnition of muscle function and understand how the structure of muscle contrib-
utes to the emergence of that function. A major challenge facing the use of muscle tissue as a
practical living actuator is the identiﬁcation of suitable tissue interfaces to allow the application of
external cues (such as mechanical forces and growth factors) to guide tissue development and to
allow the controlled generation of mechanical power.
9.3
MUSCLE: NATURE’S ACTUATOR
Skeletal muscle accounts for nearly half of the total mass of the average adult human and is unique in
its ability to actively modify its mechanical properties within tens of milliseconds to allow animals to
rapidly react to their environment. Muscle tissues have evolved over the last several billion years as
nature’s premier living generators of force, work, and power. The success of muscle tissue actuators
hinges in part upon the very favorable efﬁciency of biomolecular motors. Biomolecular motors are
the mechanically functional units of muscle cells and tissues, providing motility and mobility for
organs and organisms. Muscle cells (also known as muscle ﬁbers) serve to self-organize, maintain
and repair, and control the mechanical actions of large arrays of biomolecular motors. The tremen-
dous plasticity of form of muscle actuators is ﬁrst realized at the level of cells: biomolecular motors
are added in parallel to allow greater force generation, and are added in series to permit more rapid
movements over larger displacements. Damaged biomolecular motors are repaired or replaced by
Engineered Muscle Actuators
245

intracellular mechanisms. Muscle tissues provide the chemomechanical interface between muscle
cells and the environment. It is at the tissue level that muscle becomes a practical, responsive, and
robust actuator. Tissue level organization provides an ECM for the mechanical support and mechan-
otransduction of signals to and from the biomolecular motors within each cell. Specialized trans-
membrane structures transduce force from the arrays of biomolecular motors to the external
environment. Failures of these tissue-level structures result in severe pathology of muscle.
Muscle phenotype is known to be a result of a complex interaction between the muscle and its
environment. In the absence of the proper signals, muscle will rapidly degenerate. These signals
must include chemical signals, mechanical signals, and the activation pattern of the muscle itself.
The most important point is that these signals are mediated by the tissue interfaces, and thus it is
critical to understand, and to ultimately engineer, adequate tissue interfaces for muscle actuators.
The critical interfaces are:
1.
Vascular: the primary chemical interface, necessary for sections larger than 0.4 mm in diameter.
Perfusion of muscle tissue is important for many reasons, including the removal of metabolically-
generated heat, delivery of circulating hormones and metabolic substrates, and removal of meta-
bolic byproducts.
2.
Myotendinous (MTJ): the primary mechanical interface, necessary for mechano-transduction in
muscle, transmission of force and power to the environment without damage to the muscle cells, and
transmission of environmental loads to the muscle cells in such a way that the tissue can respond
favorably through functional adaptation. In fact, force and power are transmitted transversely into
the ECM surrounding each myoﬁbril as well as directly into the tendon. The ECM extends to meet
the tendon and transmit this additional force and power. Derangements of these paths of force
transduction at any level in general will lead to pathologies of muscle or tendon or both, often
resulting in contraction-induced injury to muscle, as is the case in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

dominant role in the control of muscle metabolism and phenotype.
9.3.1
Potential Classes of Living Muscle Actuators
There are four basic approaches to the use of muscle as a mechanical actuator: whole explanted
muscles, recellularized muscle ECM, muscle engineered in an artiﬁcial ECM, and self-organized
muscle tissue engineered in vitro. Each class of muscle actuator has technical advantages and
presents technical challenges:
9.3.1.1 Whole Explanted Muscles
Whole muscles are frequently explanted to in vitro test systems to carry out muscle tissue
evaluations. This is common practice in the pharmaceutical industry as well as in muscle research
laboratories around the world. These preparations do not qualify as muscle actuators, as they
generally have no provision to maintain the muscle explant for longer than a few hours, and they
are not conﬁgured in such a way that the muscle could perform useful external work. Such
preparations are a far cry from any practical actuator embodiments. It is possible, however, to
remove whole muscles from a variety of animals and maintain their contractile function for long
periods of time (weeks). The use of such explants as practical mechanical actuators was the focus of
preliminary work in biomechatronics at MIT in the year 2000.
Advantages: the tissue interfaces are intact and muscle can often be removed with neurovascular
pedicles to allow perfusion ex vivo.
Disadvantages: architecture is limited to that available in nature. Most natural muscles do not
have an architecture suitable for use external to the animal, often due to the tendon geometry or lack
of suitable tendons.
Potential applications: drug testing, actuator applications limited by natural architectures.

9.3.1.2 Recellularized Muscle Extracellular Matrix
Under ideal conditions in this process, muscle cells are chemically removed from the tissue, leaving
the ECM intact. The matrix would then presumably provide a perfect scaffold for the reintroduction
of suitable myogenic cells. In preliminary experiments it has been demonstrated that the acellular-
ized muscle matrix is entirely nonantigenic, so scaffolds can be removed from one animal and
implanted in another without fear of tissue rejection.
Advantages: The ECM retains much of the complex physical architecture of the tissue inter-
faces, so currently it is hypothesized that it will facilitate the reformation of suitable myotendinous
and neuromuscular junctions and vasculature for the creation of tissues suitable for surgical repair
of lost or damaged muscle tissue. Because the ECM is nonantigenic, it will be possible to remove
intact muscle structures from cadavers and acellularize them to form scaffolds for the reengineering
of living muscle tissue from the intended recipient, using the recipient’s cells (from a biopsy or
other method) to preclude subsequent postsurgical tissue rejection. Genetically engineered muscle
cells, cells from established cell lines, and primary cells may be reintroduced, as dictated by the
actuator application. The existing ECM structure of the acellularized vascular bed allows the
acellular muscle to be directly perfused.
Disadvantages: Like whole explanted muscles, the architecture of these actuators is deﬁned by
the ECM, and therefore is limited to those forms available in nature. The acellularization process
may damage some of the important chemical messages on the matrix, so this method needs to be
optimized with this in mind.
Potential applications: Recellularized ECM actuators have the complex architecture of
whole muscles in vitro, and can be recellularized using cells isolated from any animal, so they
would be perfectly suited for engineering complex muscles for surgical transplantation, such
as facial muscles. The acellularization process can be readily carried out on cadaveric muscle,
so donor tissue availability should present no difﬁculties whatsoever, thus this class of
muscle actuators presents a very promising approach for engineering muscle for surgical trans-
plantation. The acellularized matrix could be repopulated with cells donated (and subsequently
ampliﬁed in culture) by the recipient of the transplant, thereby totally eliminating the risk of tissue
rejection.
9.3.1.3 Muscle Cultured in an Artiﬁcial Matrix
A wide range of matrices are available for engineered tissues, but most are unsuitable for
engineered muscle due to their limited ability to tolerate repeated macrostrain (+15% or more
the physiologic range for muscle).
Advantages: This is the simplest class of engineered muscle, typically involving the casting of
isolated myogenic precursor cells into a gel. It is still the most commonly employed method for
engineering muscle in culture, only because it is the easiest method to carry out with the resources
available in a typical molecular biology laboratory.
Disadvantages: These constructs in the current state of the art tend to have very weak
mechanical interfaces and are thus prone to damage at their points of attachment. In addition, the
cellular density in these constructs tends to be well below that of the other three classes, thus they
pose signiﬁcant challenges when their performance is normalized by tissue volume for any
functional metric, including protein production, force generation, or sustained power output. To
date, these constructs have failed to perform adequately as mechanical actuators. Finally, the most
commonly used matrix materials inhibit myocyte fusion into myotubes, arresting the process of
muscle development and thereby limiting force and power output. The synthetic matrix materials
tend to mechanically fail (tensile failure at the tissue interface) within approximately 2 weeks in
culture, whereas self-organized engineered muscle (see below) will persist in culture for approxi-
mately 4 months, or longer.
Engineered Muscle Actuators
247

Potential applications: Drug delivery when used as an implanted device, in vitro model for
basic research in cultured muscle cells.
9.3.1.4 Self-Organized Muscle Tissue Engineered In Vitro
Isolated myogenic cells are cultured under conditions to provide cues that promote self-assembly of
the cells into functional three-dimensional (3-D) tissues.
Advantages: Self-organizing muscle tissues can take full advantage of genetic engineering
combined with the inherent phenotypic potential of all muscle tissues. Thus, a virtually limitless
range of tissue architectures are possible. In principle, any myogenic cell type from any species can
be employed. The authors (Dennis et al.) have successfully engineered skeletal and cardiac
precursor cells into functional 3-D tissues in culture from a range of animal species.
Disadvantages: The cells within the tissues tend to remain at an arrested stage of development
(neonatal phenotype), exhibiting low levels of contractility and excitability. The mechanical and
chemical environment during development must be emulated in order to promote the formation of
adequate tissue interfaces.
Potential applications: With appropriately engineered tissue interfaces and the application of
the correct external signals, self-organized muscle actuators can be used in any application for
which muscle tissue is needed. This is the most general form of engineered muscle, and has the
greatest ultimate potential for many applications. Correspondingly, this class of actuators presents
the greatest number of technical challenges.
9.4
BIOMECHATRONICS: WHY USE LIVING MUSCLE IN MACHINES?
The ability to engineer muscle actuators may have signiﬁcant impact on many areas including: (1)
drug testing and screening in in vitro bioreactors, (2) drug delivery when implanted as a living
‘‘protein factory,’’ (3) the ability to construct practical hybrid mechanical actuators and robotic
devices using both motile cells and self-organized tissues, (4) the ability to build biohybrid
prosthetic devices, (5) engineered tissue for surgical transplantation, including both skeletal
muscle (~45% of adult human body mass) and cardiac, (6) the ability to harvest high-quality
animal protein for food from a controlled bioreactor environment. The importance of the last
application becomes clear in light of recent concerns about prion disease, a growing social pressure
to reduce animal suffering, and the need for closed ecosystems for long-duration space ﬂight and
exploration.
The focus of this chapter is the use of living muscle as a mechanical actuator in engineered
systems. The main reason that living muscle is seriously considered for such use is simply because
the performance of muscle tissue as an actuator is generally quite favorable when quantitatively
compared with synthetic actuator technologies. Direct quantitative functional metrics of various
mechanical actuator systems, including muscle, have been reviewed in detail by Hollerbach et al.
(1991). The benchmark for most of the synthetic muscle actuator systems currently under devel-
opment is living muscle. Muscle has considerable advantages over many synthetic actuator
technologies both in terms of quantiﬁable FoM, as well as in terms of many qualitative features
unique to living muscle. The potential qualitative advantages of muscle are many: muscle operates
almost silently, generates biodegradable substances when converting fuel to mechanical work, can
functionally adapt to changing demands, and can take many forms and sizes unlike any traditional
synthetic actuator technology. The potential quantitative advantages of living muscle as a mech-
anical actuator are principally the high-chemomechanical efﬁciency when operating at nearly room
temperature, and the high power density with peak values ranging from 50 to 150 W/kg, depending
248
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

upon the muscle tested and the method of evaluation. There are many synthetic actuator systems
with much higher power density, but in these cases often excluded is the external power supply and
related hardware that are required to drive the actuator. Examples include hydraulic and pneumatic
actuators, as well as some types of electro-magnetic actuator systems.
9.5
QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE FUNCTION
OF LIVING MUSCLE ACTUATORS
There are many FoM that have been formulated to quantify the performance of muscle actuators to
allow comparisons between each class of muscle actuator and synthetic actuators. These standard-
ized FoM may be employed when evaluating a new engineered muscle construct or any living
muscle-based actuator system.
9.5.1
Efﬁciency (Volumetric, Metabolic, Excitatory)
9.5.1.1 Volumetric
Natural muscle tissue is characterized by an extraordinarily efﬁcient packaging of biomolecular
motors. Histologic cross-sections of healthy muscle clearly demonstrate that approximately 95% of
the muscle CSA is comprised of tightly packed ﬁlaments of biomolecular motors (the contractile
proteins actin and myosin) in a hexagonal lattice. There is little opportunity for improvement upon
nature with respect to the volumetric efﬁciency of the packaging of biomolecular motors into
functional macroscopic actuators. Synthetically organized contractile proteins are likely to have an
advantage only in single-molecule or molecular monolayer applications, and are likely to be
extremely disadvantaged when compared with natural muscle, in terms of volumetric efﬁciency.
Current cultured muscle tissues suffer from low volumetric efﬁciency in terms of contractile
proteins, typically 5 to 10% of the value of adult phenotype healthy control muscle. Also, muscle
actuators do not require external support machinery to operate in the same way that many synthetic
actuators do. One could reasonably argue that muscle requires many of the other physiologic
systems of the body to operate (pulmonary, cardiovascular, neural, gastro-intestinal, etc.), so
consider the relative masses of the actuators and the external support system. In an adult human,
approximately half of the body mass is muscle tissue. This is supported entirely by the remaining
mass of the body, which comprises all other physiologic systems. Compare this with hydraulic or
pneumatic systems, for example, for which the power generation system often weighs many times
the total mass of all actuators in the system.
9.5.1.2 Metabolic (Chemomechanical Transduction)
The metabolic efﬁciency is readily mapped into the most commonly deﬁned form of thermodynamic
efﬁciency: work OUTPUT 7 energy INPUT. In the case of muscle, this would translate simply into
the mechanical work done by the muscle actuator divided by the caloric content of the fuel (e.g.,
glucose) consumed plus the energy required to excite the muscle to contract. Corrections must be
made for the glucose stored within the muscle prior to the measurement, and for this and a number of
other reasons several indirect measures of metabolism are well advised, such as lactate production.
The metabolic efﬁciency of the muscle actuators will of course be sensitive to many factors,
including the mechanical load, muscle phenotype, fuel source, pH, temperature, diffusion distances
within the tissues, etc. The sensitivity of the actuator to these factors should be considered, in
addition to ‘‘peak’’ or ‘‘optimal’’ efﬁciency values. For example, certain species of amphibians have
muscles that operate relatively efﬁciently over large temperature ranges.
Engineered Muscle Actuators
249

9.5.1.3 Excitatory (Excitation–Contraction Coupling)
This aspect of efﬁciency is often overlooked in muscle research, but it can easily be the dominant
form of energy loss in engineered muscle actuators. This is because muscle rapidly degenerates
when maintained in an inactive state. In addition to loss of mass (atrophy), muscle tissue also
experiences a loss of excitability. In order to elicit a contraction, muscle is subjected to electrical
pulses characterized by a speciﬁed pulse width and pulse amplitude at a speciﬁed duty cycle and
duration. For any given level of contractile activation, reduced excitability manifests as either
increased pulse width, pulse amplitude, or both that are required to elicit the desired force or power
output. Based upon our extensive preliminary data with engineered muscle, developing muscle,
injured and aging muscle, denervated muscle in vivo, and denervated–stimulated muscle both
in vivo and in vitro, we calculate that unless care is taken, muscle tissue can degenerate to the
point, where the excitability is reduced by three orders of magnitude, thus requiring approximately
1000 times the electrical energy to elicit any given level of contraction. We have also reported that
the excitability of denervated muscle can be maintained at control levels by applying the correct
form of electrical stimulation.
9.5.2
Static Contractility
Static measures of contractility are readily made, and allow repeatable quantitative evaluation of
living muscle function and normalized comparisons between muscle preparations of vastly differ-
ing size and architecture. These metrics include: peak twitch force (Pt), peak tetanic force (Po), the
force–frequency relationship, speciﬁc force (sPo), baseline force (Pb), excitability (rheobase, R50
and chronaxie, C50), and the length–tension relationship.
Principal FoM (physical units follow deﬁnition):
peak normalized twitch force: Pt ¼ maximum force, single pulse input (kPa);
speciﬁc force: sPo ¼ peak tetanic contractile force or physiologic CSA (kPa);
speciﬁc baseline force: sPb ¼ baseline tensile force or physiologic CSA (kPa);
rheobase: R50 ¼ pulse ﬁeld amplitude to elicit 0.5Pt at wide pulse width (V/m);
chronaxie: C50 ¼ pulse width to elicit 0.5Pt at ﬁeld amplitudes ¼ 2R50 (s).
9.5.3
Dynamic Contractility
Measures of dynamic contractility are considerably more experimentally challenging than meas-
ures of static contractility; however, they provide considerably more insight into the function of
living muscle as a practical actuator. For this purpose, it will in general be necessary to develop
bioreactors speciﬁcally to monitor these values during the extended ex vivo maintenance of each
class of living muscle actuator (whole explanted or engineered). Dynamic contractility is generally
evaluated using one or more the following metrics: peak power, sustained power, power density
(W/kg), maximum velocity (Lf/s, where Lf ¼ muscle ﬁber length), rate of force development
(dp/dt), fatigue resistance (metabolic), and work loop performance (net power output during cyclic
loading).
Principal FoM (physical units follow deﬁnition):
peak normalized power density: i.e., peak power output/tissue mass (W/kg);
sustained power: i.e., power output at 20% duty cycle continuous (W/kg);
maximum contractile velocity: Vmax ¼ maximum contractile velocity, unloaded (Lf/s);
rate of force development: dp/dt (where p is relative force, P/Pmax) (s–1)
In general it is necessary to assemble the instrumentation systems that are necessary for quantitative
evaluation of muscle actuator function. For larger muscles that generate at least 10 mN of force
250
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

these systems can employ commercially available components that are typically used in muscle
physiology research. For smaller muscles, or muscles at early stages of development, it is in general
necessary to build many of the components. The necessary instrumentation and methods have been
reviewed by Dennis and Kosnik (2002).
In addition to the quantitative performance FoM above, the following additional evaluation
tools can be employed to quantitatively evaluate living muscle actuator systems:
.
Functional resilience: Total work output capacity per unit mass of actuator over the functional
lifetime of the actuator (J/kg)lifetime.
.
Cellular function and phenotype, as determined by quantitative histology and molecular biology.
This will include the presence of known adult isoforms of myosin heavy chain, mitochondrial
density, prevalence of central nuclei in myotubes and muscle ﬁbers, cross-sectional density of
contractile protein lattice, and indications of cellular necrosis or apoptosis.
.
Failure mode analysis and the demonstrated efﬁcacy of countermeasures that have been engineered
into the living actuator system.
9.6
PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE
USE OF LIVING MUSCLE ACTUATORS
When considering the use of living muscle in an engineered system, it is important to take into
account a number of factors that are generally not signiﬁcant challenges in traditional mechatronic
system design.
9.6.1
Fuel Sources
Muscle ex vivo can operate on a range of fuel sources that are inexpensive and readily available.
Ultimately, biomechatronic designers envision the ability of a robot to eat while it travels, much
like a ﬁsh or a horse. It will be necessary to experimentally evaluate each fuel source for use with
muscle powered actuators, since each fuel source has practical limitations and advantages. These
include speciﬁc energy (kJ/kg), solubility, thermal lability, chemical stability, toxicity, transmem-
brane transport ability in the absence of systemic metabolic modulatory hormones, and second-
order effects such as undesired chemical reactivity. The two principal fuel groups utilized by living
muscle are fatty acids and sugars. Evaluation criteria should include quantitative comparisons of
muscle actuator efﬁciency and contractility.
9.6.2
Failure Modes
Based upon our experience with each class of living muscle actuators, the following modes of
failure have been identiﬁed. For each failure mode, the muscle actuator class(es) that are subject to
the failure mode is identiﬁed, the theoretical basis for the failure is addressed with supporting
experimental veriﬁcation (if available), and corrective actions are proposed that could be imple-
mented in a biomechatronic system.
9.6.2.1 Septic Degradation of Tissue Structure
This mode of failure affects all types of muscle actuators and at room temperature typically results
in rapid functional deterioration within 24 h in the absence of countermeasures. Barrier asepsis is
probably not practical in the ultimate ﬁeld applications of living muscle actuators. Chemical
countermeasures using broad-spectrum antibiotic or antimycotic formulations in the culture
media are effective (Dennis et al., 2000, 2001). These are commercially available for tissue and
Engineered Muscle Actuators
251

organ culture and when properly employed are effective for long-term maintenance of living
tissue ex vivo.
9.6.2.2 Mechanical Failure within the Tissue (Intracellular, ECM)
Also known as contraction-induced injury, this mode of failure is prevalent in muscle tissue
subjected to maximal contractions during forced lengthening, and affects all classes of muscle
actuators. The effective countermeasure involves employing control algorithms that prevent
repeated eccentric contraction of fully activated muscle actuators. Living muscle can functionally
adapt to tolerate lengthening contractions if the proper maintenance protocols are employed. An
attempt can be made to implement such protocols in the muscle actuator bioreactors using feedback
control.
9.6.2.3 Mechanical Failure at the Tissue Interface
Less common for muscle in vivo, this is a major failure mode for explanted and engineered tissues
in general. For whole explanted muscles, the interface typically involves suture or adhesive applied
to the preexisting tendons. Lack of process control in this tissue or synthetic junction leads to
unpredictable mechanical failures over time. In engineered tissues the problem is more serious, as
tissue failure frequently occurs at the tissue or synthetic interface under relatively mild mechanical
conditions. We have extensive experimental data on this failure mode in engineered muscle tissue
subjected to external loading. We hypothesize the failure to be due to stress concentration at the
tissue or synthetic interface, compounded by inadequate force transduction from the appropriate
intracellular force generating machinery to the extracellular synthetic load bearing ﬁxtures, leading
to cell membrane damage at the interface with subsequent rapid tissue degradation and necrosis.
The best countermeasure requires the engineering of a muscle–tendon interface (MTJ), which is a
major objective of current research in muscle tissue engineering. Tendon tissue is 80 to 90% ECM,
composed chieﬂy of parallel arrays of collagen ﬁbers. The tendon-to-synthetic interface, where
biology meets machine, is a separate and equally important technical challenge.
9.6.2.4 Metabolic Failure
This failure mode results most frequently from inadequate delivery of metabolic substrates and
inadequate clearance of metabolic byproducts, and is exacerbated at elevated temperatures. The
best countermeasure for this failure mode is to restrict the muscle actuator cross-section to more
than approximately 200 mm diameter, or to provide perfusion through a vascular bed in the case of
larger cross-sections. This mode of failure typically initiates at the axial core of cylindrical muscle
actuators. For this reason, sustained angiogenesis and perfusion is a major technical objective in
current tissue engineering research.
9.6.2.5 Cellular Necrosis and Programmed Cell Death
Several controllable circumstances can lead to this general mode of failure in all classes of muscle
actuators. Cellular hypercontraction and hyperextension in muscle results in rapid necrosis. This
mechanism will occur more or less uniformly across the muscle cross-section, but will theoretically
occur more frequently in areas with reduced physiologic cross-sectional area or inhibited sarco-
meric function. This failure mode can be prevented by control of the internal mechanical compli-
ance and stroke of the muscle actuator. Muscle maintained at an inappropriate length, either too
short or too long, will deteriorate, even if the muscle is quiescent. In explanted muscles, mainte-
nance at lengths greater than the plateau of the length–tension curve appears to be the most
damaging over time.
252
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

9.6.2.6 Fatigue (Mechanical and Metabolic)
These failure modes apply to all classes of living muscle actuators. For metabolic fatigue the
preferred countermeasures will include genetic engineering of the muscle to promote fatigue-
resistant ﬁber types, the provision of adequate perfusion of the tissue actuator, and the development
of protocols for actuator control that optimize total work output, such as the intermittent locomotory
behavior of both terrestrial and aquatic animals. It is in terms of mechanical fatigue that living
actuators have an enormous advantage over fully synthetic actuators. By monitoring the state of
health of the actuator and modifying the mechanical demands accordingly, it is possible to promote
functional adaptation of the living component of the actuator as well as the tissue or synthetic
interface. It will be necessary to identify biomarkers of mechanical fatigue, such as reduced or
altered contractility, to actively detect these markers, and to respond with appropriate modiﬁcations
of the embedded excitation and control algorithms to allow tissue functional adaptation. In
principle a properly monitored and controlled living muscle actuator will exhibit improved dy-
namic performance and structural resilience with use over a period of decades, unlike any synthetic
actuator technology currently available.
9.6.2.7 Toxicity
A serious problem for all classes of living muscle actuators, the best countermeasure is barrier
exclusion of exogenous toxic agents, the use of biocompatible materials in the ﬂuid-space of the
hybrid actuator assembly, and the clearance of toxic metabolic byproducts via a perfusion and
ﬁltration system integrated with the living actuator.
9.6.2.8 Electrochemical Tissue Damage
This failure mode affects all classes of living muscle actuators when exposed to chronic electrical
stimulation. The single best countermeasure is to promote and maintain tissue phenotype exhibiting
very high excitability. In addition to vastly improving the excitation efﬁciency of the tissue, adult
muscle phenotype excitability can yield as much as a 99.9% reduction in electrical pulse energy
requirements for any given level of muscle activation, when compared with chronically denervated
or tissue engineered muscle tissue arrested at early developmental stages. For this reason, the
development of electro-mechanical muscle bioreactor systems and maintenance stimulation proto-
cols form a core component of all current research on muscle tissue engineering. Additional
countermeasures include the selection of appropriate electrode materials, the use of minimally
energetic stimulation protocols, the use of pure bipolar stimulation pulses with careful attention to
charge balancing, and the use of high-impedance outputs to the electrodes when not stimulating.
9.6.2.9 Damage from Incidental Mechanical Interference
The living actuator will require electrodes to be placed in contact with the tissue, the presence of
tubing for perfusion, and other structures required within the hybrid actuator. Lateral mechanical
contact between these synthetic objects and the living muscle tissue can result in a range of
mechanical failures, including abrasion, incision, and chronic pressure atrophy. The appropriate
countermeasure for this is careful mechanical design of the hybrid actuator assembly, with these
considerations explicitly included in the system Design Speciﬁcation.
9.6.2.10 Retrograde or Arrested Phenotype (Failure to Thrive)
Effective countermeasures for this failure mode have been reported for denervated whole muscles
in vivo, employing a long-term electrical stimulation protocol (Dennis et al., 2003; Dow et al.,
Engineered Muscle Actuators
253

2004). This failure mode is most prevalent in engineered muscle maintained in culture. There are
two approaches to dealing with this in engineered muscle: (1) genetic enhancement and (2)
development of electromechanical tissue maintenance protocols. In the case of genetic enhance-
ment, the approach is to forcibly express desired genes in an attempt to promote the desired tissue
phenotype. The effectiveness of this approach is the core issue in gene therapy for diseases of
muscle, but this approach has not yet been demonstrated to be effective for engineered muscle ex
vivo. Optimal tissue maintenance protocols are a much more natural and subtle approach, based
upon the fact that all viable muscle cells contain the necessary genetic machinery to develop any
desired muscle phenotype, if the correct signals and growth conditions prevail. In addition to
genetic engineering of myocytes to enhance performance of tissue-based actuators, other potential
countermeasures include: (1) development of appropriate tissue interfaces to permit signal trans-
duction to the cellular machinery, (2) development of tissue and organ culture bioreactors to allow
the experimental determination of optimal control and maintenance protocols for ex vivo muscle
tissue, (3) use of these protocols to guide tissue development (cell phenotype and tissue architec-
ture), and (4) implementation of this technology into the hybrid actuator system. This topic is
currently an area of very active research. Success in terms of counteracting this failure mode in
engineered muscle will constitute an extraordinarily signiﬁcant scientiﬁc contribution, as well as
providing the key enabling technology to the further development of practical living actuators.
9.7
SELF-ORGANIZING MUSCLE TISSUES
Self-organization within developing animals gives rise to an enormous array of muscle actuator
architectures. Each myogenic precursor cell contains the genetic potential to self-organize into
muscle tissue with the desired phenotype and tissue interface. The ability to guide the development
of self-organizing muscle tissues in culture will provide the systems engineer with the greatest
level of design ﬂexibility, since it will in principle be possible to start with a small population of
muscle progenitor cells and guide them to self-organize into a muscle actuator of any imaginable
geometry. It will also be possible to construct hybrid actuators not found in nature, containing
regionally organized tissue structures, perhaps even consisting of fundamentally different types
of muscle tissue (skeletal, cardiac, or smooth), depending upon the functional requirements of
the actuator system. It is implicit in most muscle tissue engineering research programs that
skeletal muscle self-organization and development can be guided by the application of the correct
external cues. The general method of guided tissue self-organization in culture (Figure 9.1)
brieﬂy is:
.
Isolate and coculture the desired cells. The cells may be primary or from cell lines.
.
Engineer a cell culture substrate with controlled adhesion properties for the cells.
.
Provide permanent anchor points and surfaces to guide tissue architecture formation.
.
Culture the cells to permit the formation of a cohesive monolayer.
.
Induce monolayer delamination from the substrate at the appropriate point in cell differentiation
(the monolayer remains attached to the anchor points).
.
Promote tissue self-organization and further development by applying external signals: chemical,
electrical, mechanical.
Self-organization of tissues in culture is one effective way to produce small functional tissue
constructs from a range of tissues. Examples include:
.
Cardiac myocytes cocultured at conﬂuence with ﬁbroblasts will self-organize into long cylinders
and tapered cones in culture in 340 to 400 h. These constructs are electrically excitable and also
spontaneously contract as a syncytium to continuously generate signiﬁcant mechanical work
cycles. Such constructs could be engineered to power cell-scaled implantable pumps, pumps for
254
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

stand-alone hybrid tissue actuators, or to engineer cardiac tissue for surgical transplantation in
cardiac reconstructive surgery.
.
Tendon (Ligament) tissue will self-organize in culture under the appropriate conditions. The ﬁbro-
blasts within the tissue produce a prodigious amount of ECM material, with collagen ﬁbers that are
oriented along lines of tensile stress, particularly at locations within the tissue where mechanical
interfaces are present (such as suture anchor materials, metal posts, etc.). Self-organization is driven
by loss of substrate adhesion and the generation of internal tensile stress by the action of the
ﬁbroblasts on the order of 0 to 6 Pa, which can be experimentally controlled by external factors
such as the presence of ascorbic acid, serum concentration in the cell culture medium, pH, etc.
.
Muscle Chimeras: One additional interesting technical possibility is the in vitro fusion of myogenic
precursor cells from different tissue sources to form chimeric self-organized engineered muscles.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that skeletal muscle satellite cells from differing species will
fuse to form multinucleated myotubes with desirable contractile function. In addition, isolated
cardiac myocyteswill fuseinto preexisting myotubes inculture, toproducea skeletal–cardiac muscle
hybrid. Such chimeric muscle tissues are not known to exist in nature, but our preliminary data
indicate that they are both stable and functional in culture. The contractile function of such chimeric
cells and tissues could potentially be engineered to produce tissue-based actuators with combinations
of desired characteristics that would be advantageous for use in hybrid bioactuator applications.
9.8
ACELLULARIZED–RECELLULARIZED ECM ENGINEERED MUSCLES
The native ECM of muscle tissue occupies approximately less than 5% of the tissue volume, yet it
contains information about the complex architecture of muscle and the corresponding soft tissue

interfaces. The cellular components of muscle can be chemically removed while retaining the
detailed architecture of the muscle ECM. Preliminary results indicate the success of the reintro-
duction of myogenic cells into these natural ECM scaffolds. This approach to engineering muscles
as actuators has several advantages, among these are that heterogenic cells can be introduced into
the preexisting matrix. For example, skeletal–cardiac chimeric muscles could be employed or
myogenic precursors from an entirely different species. The main advantage of the use of
natural ECM scaffolds is that the ﬁne architecture of the entire muscle organ is retained by the
acellularized ECM scaffold. It is possible to perfuse the scaffold using the remnant vascular bed
ECM to reintroduce cells and later to provide perfusion to the reengineered muscle organ. The
acellularized muscle ECM also has matrix architecture speciﬁc to the MTJ and tendon, which may
be advantageous in the development of this very critical tissue interface. The principal disadvantage
of this approach is that the ECM scaffold architecture is limited to those architectures that are
available in nature.
9.9
TISSUE INTERFACES: TENDON, NERVE, AND VASCULAR
For any type of muscle actuator, it will be essential to provide appropriate tissue interfaces. In some
cases, the tissue interfaces are already in place and speciﬁc measures must be taken to maintain
them properly. In other cases, their formation must be guided and facilitated. Based upon our in vivo
work, we have demonstrated that muscle phenotype can be controlled and maintained in the
absence of innervation via electrical stimulation. A considerable volume of published research
has been directed toward the promotion of adult phenotype in muscle tissue in culture directly
by electrical stimulation, in the absence of nerve-derived trophic factors or depolarization via
the neuromuscular junction and related synaptic structures. It remains to be demonstrated,
however, that muscle can be guided through the necessary developmental stages in the absence
of innervation to achieve adult phenotype. Adequate and functional vascular and tendon interfaces
to muscle engineered in vitro are also yet to be demonstrated, although they are the topic of
intensive research.
9.9.1
Vascular Tissue Interface
Nutrition and oxygen delivery in static culture conditions always limit the cross-sectional area,
particularly for tissues with high metabolic demand, such as muscle. Therefore, a 3-D organ culture
system with perfusion of a vascular bed within the muscle tissue is a core objective of current
research. Cell types associated with angiogenesis, such as endothelial cells, are also crucial players
in organ development (Bahary and Zon, 2001). Endothelial progenitor cells from peripheral blood
are readily isolated, and have been shown to incorporate into neovessels (Asahara et al. , 1997) and
also have potential to expand to more than 1019-fold in vitro (Lin et al., 2000). Furthermore,
functional small-diameter neovessels can be created in culture by using endothelial progenitor cells
(Kaushal et al., 2001).

Strategies for Engineering Functional Vascularized Muscle Tissue
There are three strategies for generating vascularized muscle constructs:
(1)
Recellularization of an acellular muscle construct.
(2)
Coculture of myoblasts with endothelial cells and growth factor stimulation for induction of the
endothelial cells to form capillary like structures.
(3)
Induction of sprouting of microvessels into temporarily implanted tissues or from vascularized and
perfused tissue explants (such as adipose) cultured adjacent to the engineered muscle.
256
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

The strategies for generating functional muscle tissue can be broadly divided into in vitro and in vivo
strategies, the ultimate outcome of which would be a vascularized muscle construct. In any case,
once a vascular bed is established, the constructs need to be maintained in a bioreactor to provide
further electrical, mechanical, and chemical stimulation, thus guiding both the phenotype and
resulting in the development of a fully function muscle construct.
9.9.2.1 Recellularization of an Acellular Muscle Construct
This experimental approach involves harvesting muscle tissue from any natural source and
using chemical acellularization to remove myoblasts and ﬁbroblasts leaving behind an intact
ECM. The ECM should be evaluated for structural integrity and immunogenic behavior and
its ability to support myoblast growth and differentiation. The ECM should then be used as
scaffolding material for seeding primary myoblast and the construct will be placed in a perfusion
bioreactor allowing formation of functional skeletal muscle tissue (Hall, 1997). Immunohis-
tochemical studies should be performed to determine which ECM components are present in
the acellular construct, such as collagen types I and IV, ﬁbronectin, laminin, vitronectin,
entactin, heparin sulfate, proteoglycan, and elastin. The acellular muscle can be repopulated
by obtaining a puriﬁed sample of myogenic precursor cells, which may be injected or perfused
into the acellular muscle. Although some initial success has been reported with this
general approach, it has not yet been possible to maintain perfusion of the tissue samples in culture
for a period sufﬁciently long to promote and maintain full cellular inﬁltration into the acellular
scaffold.
9.9.2.2 Coculture Systems
Since the early 1990s, there have been reports of the use of various coculture systems to study cell–
cell interactions and the formation of tissue interfaces. For vasculogenesis, the cells in question are
presumed to be myoblast and endothelial cells. Although promising initial reports have been
published, a truly successful demonstration of a vascular bed self-organizing within a tissue
construct has yet to be demonstrated. The design of bioreactors for such a technology must
stimulate the myoblasts to form functional muscle tissue and simultaneously guide the endothelial
cells to form capillary-like structures within the newly forming muscle tissue, while providing
perfusion during development. The environment, which the bioreactor provides together with
soluble growth factor stimulation, will presumably allow formation of a functional muscle con-
struct (Vernon, 1999).
9.9.2.3 Induced Microvessel Sprouting
This approach can be attempted either in vivo or ex vivo using small vascularized tissue explants
which are cannulated and perfused while adjacent to an avascular tissue such as engineered skeletal
muscle. This is an active area of current research. For the in vivo approach, it is necessary to
mechanically support the muscle tissue while implanted to prevent hypercontraction and subse-
quent tissue damage. It is also necessary to take measures to prevent tissue rejection to implantation
into syngenic animals, or the use of immune-suppressive agents, is required. Otherwise, this method
is relatively quite simple and often yields satisfactory results. In addition to vascularization of the
implanted muscle tissue, there are collateral effects, as yet not fully understood, that also tend to
drive the muscle phenotype toward an adult phenotype, with enhanced contractility. For this reason,
it is likely that the future of tissue engineering will see increasingly common application of the
approach where the intended recipient is used as a ready-made bioreactor vessel. The engineered
tissues would be implanted within the person, presumably along with means to enhance tissue
development and to prevent tissue degeneration or resorption while implanted. The tissue need not

257

be implanted at the ultimate site for which it is intended, however, it is essential to consider the
morbidity of the site at which the disuse will be initially developed.
9.9.3
Engineered Tissue Interface: Tendon
The MTJ is critical for the ability of muscle tissue to transduce force to and from the external
environment, and to produce maximal power without subsequent injury to the muscle cells in
the contractile tissue. The MTJ contains specialized structures at the cell membrane which
facilitate transmembrane transmission of force from the contractile proteins (biomolecular
motors) within the cell to the surrounding collagen ﬁbrils in the ECM (Trotter, 1993). These
structures include a large number of infoldings of the muscle cell membrane at the MTJ, increasing
the membrane surface area and acting to transfer stress from the cytoskeleton to the ECM in
the tendon. These structures have also been demonstrated to occur when myotubes are cocultured
with ﬁbroblasts concentrated near the ends of the muscle constructs in vitro (Swasdison and
Mayne, 1991). In the case of whole explanted muscle actuators, the MTJ already exists, and it
is necessary to maintain this structure in vitro. In all other classes of muscle actuator it is
necessary to generate or regenerate the MTJ and tendon structures. Currently, attempts to engineer
tendon-like structures and muscle–tendon junctions in culture follow one of three distinct
approaches:
(1)
Scaffold-based tendon, used as an anchor material for engineered muscle.
(2)
Self-organizing tendon and muscle-tendon structures in co-culture.
(3)
Direct laser transfer of muscle and tendon cells into deﬁned 3-D structures.
9.9.4
Nerve–Muscle Interfaces
Skeletal muscle phenotype is deﬁned largely by the motor nerve which innervates each muscle
ﬁber. Adult muscles may be either fast- or slow-twitch, but in general in humans muscles are
mixed, containing signiﬁcant populations of both fast- and slow-twitch ﬁbers. Denervated muscle
rapidly loses tissue mass and the adult phenotype, with contractility eventually dropping to
essentially zero. Although it is possible to maintain adult phenotype of adult skeletal muscle in
the absence of innervation, it is not yet clear whether it is possible to guide skeletal muscle
tissue development to an adult phenotype in an entirely aneural culture environment. For that
reason, nerve–muscle synaptogenesis in culture is an area of active research in tissue engineering.
Putative synaptic structures in vitro have been reported for decades (Ecob et al., 1983; Ecob, 1983,
1984; Ecob and Whalen, 1985), in some cases axon sprouting from nerves to muscle tissue
in culture is clearly visible (Figure 9.2) and veriﬁed upon histologic examination; however,
functional nerve–muscle in vitro systems that result in advanced tissue development have yet to
be demonstrated.
9.9.5
Tissue–Synthetic Interfaces
Another key challenge is to develop means to mechanically interface living muscle cells and tissues
to synthetic ﬁxtures in such a way that the tissue development and function will not be inhibited.
The technical challenge is to provide a transition of mechanical stiffness and cell density in the
region between the contractile tissue and the synthetic ﬁxture, to reduce stress concentrations at the
tissue interface and provide mechanical impedance matching. Several approaches are currently
under investigation, including the chemical functionalization of synthetic surfaces to bind collagen,
and the use of porous scaffolds to promote tissue in-growth at the desired tissue or synthetic
interface.

MUSCLE BIOREACTOR DESIGN FOR THE IDENTIFICATION,
CONTROL, AND MAINTENANCE OF MUSCLE TISSUE
The engineering of complex functional tissues such as skeletal muscle is by deﬁnition a systems
engineering problem. Functional muscles are composed of a number of highly integrated tissue
systems, none of which is known to function in isolation for any signiﬁcant period of time without
massive deterioration in performance. Any attempt to engineer a functional muscle tissue system
ex vivo, and to employ that muscle system as a source of motility in robots or prostheses, will by
necessity require the development of bioreactor technologies to (1) guide the tissue development to
the desired phenotype ex vivo, (2) maintain the tissue at the desired phenotype while it is performing
its function, and (3) control the mechanical output of the tissue through electrical stimulation.
Critical to these three objectives are bioreactor technologies that are capable of monitoring and
controlling a muscle’s mechanical and electrical environment.
In Figure 9.3, a muscle bioreactor is shown that can implement muscle identiﬁcation, control,
and maintenance protocols under generalized boundary conditions while also providing ﬂexible
feedback control of electrical stimulation parameters (Farahat and Herr, 2005). These features are
accomplished by having two real-time control loops running in parallel. The ﬁrst loop, or the
mechanical boundary condition (MBC) control loop, ensures that the mechanical response of
the servo simulates the dynamics of the associated muscle boundary condition. For example,
if the desired boundary condition is a second order, mass–spring–damper system, the MBC control
loop controls the motion of the end points of the muscle–tendon unit as if the muscle–tendon were
actually pulling against physical mass–spring–damper mechanical elements. The MBC control
loop allows for a whole host of boundary conditions, from ﬁnite (but nonzero) to inﬁnite impedance
conditions. Clearly, to understand muscle tissue performance, muscle dynamics, and the dynamics
of the load for which the muscle acts upon must be taken into consideration. Examples of ﬁnite-
impedance boundary conditions include loads such as springs, dampers, masses, viscous friction,
coulomb friction, or a combination thereof. Such loads prescribe boundary conditions that are
generally deﬁned in terms of dynamic relationships between force and displacement. Under these
loading conditions, it would be expected that the dynamics of the load will interact with the
contraction dynamics of the muscle, leading to a behavior that is a resultant of both. This is

Tissue Engineering Laboratory at the University of Michigan: Calderon, Dow, Borschel, Dennis.)

primarily because the force generated by muscle is dependent on its mechanical state, namely its
length and velocity.
The second control loop for the bioreactor design of Figure 9.3 implements the electrical
stimulus (ES) control based on measurements of the muscle’s mechanical response. This loop,
referred to as the ES control loop, offers simultaneous real-time modulation of pulse width,
amplitude, frequency, and the number of pulses per cycle. There is increasing experimental interest
in real-time control of muscles, primarily in the context of functional electrical stimulation (FES)
(Chizeck et al., 1988; Veltink et al., 1992; Eser et al., 2003; Jezernik et al., 2004). In these
investigations, attempts were made to control the response of muscle(s) and associated loads to a
desired trajectory by varying electrical stimulation parameters as a function of time. Electrical
stimulation patterns are typically square pulses characterized by frequency, amplitude, pulse width,
and number of pulses per trigger (considering the cases of doublets, triplets, or more generally
N-lets). For testing a variety of FES algorithms, the ES control loop is designed for real-time
modulation of these stimulation parameters as a function of a muscle’s mechanical response,
including tissue length, contraction velocity, and borne muscular force.

CASE STUDY IN BIOMECHATRONICS:
A MUSCLE ACTUATED SWIMMING ROBOT
Biomechatronics is the integration of biological materials with artiﬁcial devices, in which the
biological component enhances the functional capability of the system, and the artiﬁcial component
provides speciﬁc environmental signals that promote the maintenance and functional adaptation of
the biological component. Recent investigations have begun to examine the feasibility of using
animal-derived muscle as an actuator for artiﬁcial devices in the millimeter to centimeter size scale
Figure 9.3 (See color insert following page 302)
Muscle Bioreactor Technology. Muscle identiﬁcation, control,
and maintenance apparatus is shown with the primary sensors and actuators noted. The coarse positioning stage is
adjusted at the beginning of the experiment to accommodate different tissue lengths, but is typically kept at a
constant position during a particular contraction. The primary stage provides the motion that simulates the boundary
condition force law with which the muscle specimen pulls against. The vertical syringe has a suction electrode at its
tip that is connected to the stimulation electronics in the background. The encoder and load cell measure muscle
displacement and force, respectively, and are employed as sensory control inputs during FES control experimen-
tation. Silicone tubing recirculates solution via a peristaltic pump, while oxygen is injected in the loop.

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

(Herr and Dennis, 2004). Although a great deal of research has been conducted to develop an
actuator technology with muscle-like properties, engineering science has not yet produced a motor
system that can mimic the contractility, energetics, scalability, and plasticity of muscle tissue
(Hollerbach et al., 1991; Meijer et al., 2003). As a demonstratory proof of concept, Herr and Dennis
(2004) designed, built, and characterized a swimming robot actuated by two explanted frog
semitendinosus muscles and controlled by an embedded microcontroller (Figure 9.4). Using open
loop stimulation protocols, their robot performed basic swimming maneuvers such as starting,
stopping, turning (turning radius ~ 400 mm), and straight-line swimming (max speed > 1/3 body
lengths/sec). A broad-spectrum antibiotic or antimycotic ringer solution surrounded the muscle
actuators for long-term maintenance, ex vivo. The robot swam for a total of 4 h over a 42-h lifespan
(10% duty cycle) before its velocity degraded below 75% of its maximum. The mechanical
swimming efﬁciency of the biomechatronic robot, as determined by a slip value of 0.32, was
within the biological efﬁciency range. Slip values increase with swimming speed in biological
swimming, ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 in most ﬁsh (Gillis, 1997, 1998).
The development of functional biomechatronic prototypes with integrated musculoskeletal
tissues is the ﬁrst critical step toward the long-term objective of controllable, adaptive, and robust
biomechatronic robots and prostheses. The results of the swimming robot study of Herr and Dennis
(2004), although preliminary, suggest that some degree of ex vivo robustness and controllability is
possible for natural muscle actuators if adequate chemical and electromechanical interventions are
supplied from a host robotic system. An important area of future research will be to establish
processes by which optimal intervention strategies are deﬁned to maximize tissue longevity for a
given hybrid-machine task objective. Another important research area is tissue control. It is well
established that natural muscle changes in size and strength depending on environmental work-
load, and when supplied with appropriate signals, changes frequency characteristic or ﬁber type
(Green et al., 1983, 1984; Delp and Pette, 1994). Hence, an important area of future work will be to
put forth strategies by which muscle tissue plasticity can be monitored and controlled. Still further,

actuators, two lithium ion batteries (4) are attached to the robot’s frame (5). During performance evaluations, the

strategies must also be devised to control the force and power output of muscle, in the context of
robotic systems, through the modulation of electrical pulses to the muscle cell. Also, for the
development of controllable, adaptive and robust biomechatronic systems, feedback control sys-
tems that monitor and adapt the mechanical, electrical, and chemical environment of muscle
actuators are of critical importance.
9.12
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Muscle tissue as a mechanical actuator has great, though as-yet unrealized potential for use
in engineered systems. Synthetic technologies such as electroactive polymers are rapidly emerging
as quantitatively functional equivalents to muscle tissue, and it is likely that the technological
evolution of EAP muscles will soon out-pace the natural functional evolution of living muscle
tissue. This means that the quantitative performance advantages that muscle tissue has over some
forms of synthetic actuators in terms of efﬁciency, power density, and so forth are not likely to
remain the case for very much longer. One then invariably must ask why it is advantageous to even
consider the use of living muscle tissue as a mechanical actuator. It is easy to point out that the
many disadvantages of muscle outweigh the few performance advantages it may have. The answer
lies chieﬂy in the qualitative differences between muscle and competing synthetic actuator tech-
nologies, among these are those qualities that arise from muscle being a living tissue: its ability to
functionally adapt and to potentially integrate seamlessly with other living structures. So it is likely
that living muscle actuators will only be employed in practical systems where their qualitative
advantages as living tissue can be exploited to maximum beneﬁt, such as in hybrid biomechatronic
prosthetic systems and implants, and perhaps in bioreactors where their biological products (such as
edible proteins) are of primary importance. Certainly though, living muscle tissue serves as the
explicit benchmark against which the performance of synthetic actuator technologies will be
evaluated for many decades to come.

INTRODUCTION
Natural muscles are one of the most important actuators in biological systems larger than a
bacterium. They are highly optimized since they are fundamentally driven by the same mechanism
in all animals and the difference between species is relatively small. The drive mechanism of
muscles is complex and they are capable of lifting large loads with short time response in the range
of milliseconds. Human made actuators that most closely emulate muscles are the recently emerged
267

electroactive polymers (EAP) that exhibit a large strain in response to electrical stimulation. For
this response, EAP have earned the moniker ‘‘artiﬁcial muscles’’ (Bar-Cohen, 2001, 2004). The
impressive advances in improving their actuation strain capability are attracting the attention of
engineers and scientists from many different disciplines. These materials are particularly attractive
to biomimetics since they can be used to mimic the movements of humans, animals, and insects for
making biologically inspired intelligent robots (Bar-Cohen and Breazeal, 2003) and other biomi-
metic mechanisms. Increasingly, engineers are able to develop EAP-actuated mechanisms that
were previously imaginable only in science ﬁction.
For many decades, it has been known that certain types of polymers can change shape in
response to electrical stimulation. Initially, these EAP materials were capable of producing only a
relatively small strain. Since the beginning of the 1990s, new EAP materials emerged exhibiting
large strains and leading to a great paradigm change with regard to the capability of EAP and their
potential. Generally, EAP materials can generate strains that are as high as two orders of magnitude
greater than the striction-limited, rigid, and fragile piezoelectric ceramics. Further, EAP materials
are superior to shape memory alloys (SMA) in higher response speed, lower density, and greater
resilience. They can be used to make mechanical devices without the need for traditional compon-
ents like gears, and bearings, which are responsible for the current high costs, weight, and
premature failures. The current limitations of EAP materials that include low actuation force,
mechanical energy density, and robustness constrain the practical application but improvements in
the ﬁeld are expected to overcome these limitations.
In 1999, in recognition of the need for international cooperation among the developers, users,
and potential sponsors, the author initiated a related annual SPIE conference as part of the
Smart Structures and Materials Symposium (Bar-Cohen, 1999). This conference was held in
Newport Beach, California, USA and was the largest ever on this subject, marking an important
milestone and turning the spotlight onto these emerging materials and their potential. The
SPIE EAP Actuators and Devices (EAPAD) conferences are now organized annually and have
been steadily growing in number of presentations and attendees. Also, the author releases the
semiannual WW-EAP Newsletter electronically, and mentors a website that archives related
information and includes links to homepages of EAP research and development facilities world-
wide (http://eap.jpl.nasa.gov). In the past few years, in addition to the SPIE conferences, several
other conferences and special sessions within conferences focusing on EAP actuators have also
taken place.
10.2
HISTORY AND CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ACTIVE POLYMERS
The beginning of the ﬁeld of EAP can be traced back to an 1880-experiment that was conducted by
Roentgen using a rubber-band with ﬁxed end and a mass attached to the free end that was subjected
to electric ﬁeld across the rubber-band (Roentgen, 1880). Sacerdote (1899) followed this experi-
ment with a formulation of the strain-response to electric ﬁeld activation. Further milestone
progress was recorded in 1925 with the discovery of a piezoelectric polymer called electret when
carnauba wax, rosin, and beeswax were solidiﬁed by cooling while subjected to a DC-bias ﬁeld
(Eguchi, 1925). Generally, electrets are polymer materials with aligned electrical dipole moments
equivalent to magnets, and they are deformed when subjected to voltage across them. However,
their strain and work output is generally too low to be applicable as actuators and therefore their use
has been limited to sensors.
Generally, electrical excitation is only one of the types of stimulators to cause elastic deform-
ation in polymers. Other activation mechanisms include chemical (Kuhn et al., 1950; Otero et al.,
1995), thermal (Li et al., 1999), pneumatic (Chou and Hannaford, 1994), optical (van der Veen
and Prins, 1971), and magnetic (Zrinyi et al., 1997). Polymers that are chemically stimulated
268

were discovered over half-a-century ago when collagen ﬁlaments were demonstrated to revers-
ibly contract or expand upon dipping into acidic or alkaline aqueous solutions, respectively
(Katchalsky, 1949). Even though relatively little has since been done to apply such ‘‘chemo-
mechanical’’ as practical actuators, this early work pioneered the development of synthetic poly-
mers that mimic biological muscles (Steinberg et al., 1966). The convenience and practicality
of electrical stimulation, and technology progress led to a growing interest in EAP materials.
Following the 1969 observation of a substantial piezoelectric activity in polyvinylidene ﬂuoride
(PVDF) (Bar-Cohen et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 1998), investigators started to examine other
polymer systems, and a series of effective materials have emerged. The largest progress in EAP
materials development has been reported in the last 15 years (Bar-Cohen, 2001, 2004) where
materials that can create linear strains that can reach up to 380% have been developed (Pelrine
et al., 2000; Kornbluh et al., 2004).
Generally, EAP can be divided into two major groups based on their activation mechanism:
ionic (involving mobility or diffusion of ions) and electronic (driven by electric ﬁeld or Maxwell
Forces) (Bar-Cohen, 2001, 2004). A summary of the advantaged and disadvantages of these two
group of materials are listed in Table 10.1. The electronic polymers (electrostrictive, electrostatic,
piezoelectric, and ferroelectric) are driven by Maxwell Forces and can be made to hold the induced
displacement under activation of a DC voltage, allowing them to be considered for robotic
applications. Also, these materials have a greater mechanical energy density and they can
be operated in air with no major constraints. However, they require a high activation ﬁeld
(>100-V/mm) close to the breakdown level. In contrast, ionic EAP materials (gels, polymer–
metal composites, conductive polymers, and carbon nanotubes) are driven by diffusion of ions
and they require an electrolyte for the actuation mechanism. Their major advantage is the

requirement for drive voltages as low as 1 to 2 V. However, it is necessary to maintain wetness, and
except for conductive polymers and carbon nanotubes it is difﬁcult to sustain DC-induced dis-
placements. The induced displacement of both the electronic and ionic EAP can be geometrically
designed to bend, stretch, or contract. Any of the existing EAP materials can be made to bend with a
signiﬁcant curving response, offering actuators with an easy to see reaction and an appealing
response. However, bending actuators have relatively limited applications due to the low force or
torque that can be induced.
10.3
TYPES OF ELECTROACTIVE POLYMERS
The types of EAP in each of the two material groups are given below:
10.3.1
Electronic EAP
The electronic types of EAP consist of materials that are squeezed by the attraction force between
the charged electrodes. Some materials in this group are internally affected to augment the
squeezing effect. The dielectric elastomer sustains a deformation under the stress induced by the
electric ﬁeld driven by Maxwell Forces (Zhang et al., 2004). The other type of electronic EAP
materials is internally active and sustains realignment of the molecular structure (e.g., pendant
group on a backbone chain) or shift of atoms in the crystallographic structure in response to the
ﬁeld. The electronic type of EAP materials include:
10.3.1.1 Dielectric Elastomer EAP
Polymers with low elastic stiffness and high dielectric breakdown strength can be used to produce a
large actuation strain by subjecting them to an electrostatic ﬁeld. Such EAP materials also known as
dielectric elastomer EAP can be represented by a parallel plate capacitor as shown in Figure 10.1
(Pelrine et al., 1998; Kornbluh et al., 2004). The electrodes are highly compliant so as not to impede
the deformation of the ﬁlm. The strain that results from applying an electric ﬁeld is proportional to
the square of the electric ﬁeld square, multiplied by the dielectric constant, and it is inversely
proportional to the elastic modulus. To reach the required electric ﬁeld levels, one needs to use high
voltage or employ thin ﬁlms or both. Under an electric ﬁeld, the ﬁlm is squeezed in the thickness
direction, causing expansion in the transverse planar direction.
The above characteristic allows for the production of linear actuators using dielectric elastomer
ﬁlms that appear to act similar to biological muscles. For this purpose, SRI International scientists
constructed actuators using two elastomer layers with carbon electrodes on both sides of one of the
layers, where the layers were rolled to form a cylindrical actuator. The rolled actuator expands
longitudinally as a result of the Poisson effect of transverse expansion of the ﬁlm that is caused by
its being squeezed by Maxwell Forces. Thereby, the lateral expansion leads to a lateral stretch of the

EAP. A variety of other actuator conﬁgurations are also possible (Kornbluh et al., 2004). Dielectric
elastomer EAP actuators require large electric ﬁelds (~100 V/mm) and can induce signiﬁcant levels
of strain (10 to about 380%). Overall, the associated voltages are close to the breakdown strength of
the material, and a safety factor that lowers the potential is used. Moreover, the relatively small
breakdown strength of air (2 to 3 V/mm) presents an additional challenge for packaging the
actuator. Another concern that is associated with the use of dielectric elastomer EAP is that the
actuator requires prestraining the elastomer ﬁlm and over time the prestrain is released due to creep
degrading the actuator performance. Research at Sungkyunkwan University, Korea, shows promise
with regard to actuators that do not require prestrain (Jung et al., 2004). Recently, an SRI
International research team designed a multi-functional electroelastomer roll (MER) in which
highly prestrained dielectric elastomer EAP ﬁlms were rolled around a compression spring to
form an actuator (Pei et al., 2002, 2004). By selectively actuating only certain regions of electrodes
around the periphery of the actuator, the actuator can be made to bend as well as elongate. An
example of this MER actuator is shown in Figure 10.2 and it represents advancement in making
practical EAP-based actuators with a standard conﬁguration.
10.3.1.2 Ferroelectric Polymers
Piezoelectricity was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Paul-Jacques Curie, who found that when
certain types of crystals are compressed (e.g., quartz, tourmaline, and Rochelle salt), along certain
axes, a voltage is produced on the surface of the crystal. The year afterward, they observed the
reverse effect that upon the application of an electric voltage these crystals sustain an elongation.
Piezoelectricity is found only in noncentro-symmetric materials and the phenomenon is called
ferroelectricity when a nonconducting crystal or dielectric material exhibits spontaneous electric
polarization. There are also polymers with ferroelectric behavior and the most widely exploited one
is the poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride), which is known as PVDF or PVF2, and its copolymers (Bar-Cohen
et al., 1996). These polymers are partly crystalline, with an inactive amorphous phase, having a
Young’s modulus near 1 to 10 GPa. This relatively high elastic modulus offers a relatively high
mechanical energy density. A large applied electric ﬁeld (~200 MV/m) can induce electrostrictive
(nonlinear) strains of nearly 2% (Zhang et al., 2004). Unfortunately, this level of ﬁeld is danger-
ously close to dielectric breakdown, and the dielectric hysteresis (loss, heating) is very large. In
1998, Zhang and his coinvestigators introduced defects into the crystalline structure using electron
radiation to increase the dielectric constant of the copolymer P(VDF-TrFE). As a result, electro-
strictive strains as large as 5% were demonstrated at low frequency drive ﬁelds having amplitudes
of about 150 V/mm. Furthermore, the polymer has a high elastic modulus (~1 GPa), and the ﬁeld-

Park, CA, U.S.A.)
Artiﬁcial Muscles Using EAP

induced strain can operate at frequencies higher than 100 kHz, resulting in a very high elastic power
density compared with other EAP materials.
The irradiation of P(VDF-TrFE) into a relaxor ferroelectric with high electrostriction also
introduces many undesirable defects to the copolymer including the formation of crosslinkings,
radicals, and chain scission (Mabboux and Gleason, 2002; Bharti et al., 2000). By a proper
molecular design which enhances the degree of molecular level conformational changes in the
polymer, terpolymers are produced that can exhibit a higher electromechanical response than the
high energy electron irradiated copolymer (Zhang et al., 2004).
Ferroelectric EAP polymer actuators can be operated in air, vacuum, and water. To reduce the,
level of voltage that is needed to activate the ferroelectric EAP, Zhang et al. (2004) used an all-
organic composite with organic particulates that have a high dielectric constant (K > 10,000).
These researchers used a blend of the particulates in a polymer matrix to increase the dielectric
constant from single digits to the range from 300 to 1,000 (at 1 Hz). This approach led to an EAP
that requires signiﬁcantly lower voltage as predicted by the author (Section 14.2.2 in Bar-Cohen,
2001). For example, a strain of about 2% is generated by a ﬁeld of 13 V/mm for a CuPc-PVDF-
based terpolymer composite having an elastic modulus of 0.75 GPa. A photographic view of this
EAP in passive and activated states is shown in Figure 10.3. One of the challenges to using this
material in practical applications is the large dielectric losses involved.
10.3.1.3 Electrostrictive Graft Elastomers
In 1998, a graft-elastomer EAP was developed at NASA Langley Research Center (Su et al., 1999).
This EAP material exhibits a large electric-ﬁeld-induced strain due to electrostriction (Zhang

et al., 2004). This electrostrictive polymer consists of two components, a ﬂexible backbone
macromolecule and a grafted polymer that can form a crystalline structure. The grafted crystalline
polar phase provides moieties in response to an applied electric ﬁeld and cross-linking sites
for the elastomer system. This material offers high electric-ﬁeld-induced strain (~4%), relatively
high electromechanical power density, and excellent processability. Combination of the elec-
trostrictive-grafted elastomer with a piezoelectric poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride-triﬂuoroethylene)
copolymer yields several compositions of a ferroelectric–electrostrictive molecular composite
system. Such a combination can be operated both as a piezoelectric sensor and as an electro-
strictive actuator. Careful selection of the composition allows the creation and optimization of the
molecular composite system with respect to its electrical, mechanical, and electromechanical
properties.
10.3.1.4 Electrostrictive Paper
The use of paper as an electrostrictive EAP actuator was demonstrated at Inha University, Korea
(Kim et al., 2000). Paper is composed of a multitude of discrete particles, mainly of a ﬁbrous nature,
which form a network structure. Since paper is produced in various mechanical processes with
chemical additives, it is possible to prepare a paper that has enhanced electroactive properties. Such
an EAP actuator has been prepared by bonding two silver laminated papers with silver electrodes
placed on the ouside surface. When an electric voltage is applied to the electrodes the actuator
produces bending displacement, and its performance depends on the excitation voltages, frequen-
cies, type of adhesive, and the host paper. Studies indicate that the electrostriction effect that
is associated with this actuator is the result of electrostatic forces and an intermolecular interaction
of the adhesive. The demonstrated actuator is lightweight and simple to fabricate. Various appli-
cations that are currently being considered include active sound absorbing materials, ﬂexible
speakers, and smart shape-control devices. The energy density of these materials and electromech-
anical coupling is relatively small.
10.3.2
Ionic EAP
Ionic EAP materials consist of a polymer with electrolyte and two electrodes where the phenom-
enon of electroactivation involves diffusion of ions through the thickness of the polymer (Bar-
Cohen, 2004). This group includes of the following types of EAP materials:
10.3.2.1 Ionic Polymer Gels
Polymer gels can be synthesized to produce signiﬁcant actuation forces potentially matching
the force and energy density of biological muscles (Calvert, 2004). These materials (e.g., poly-
acrylonitrile) are generally activated by a chemical reaction, changing from an acidic to an
alkaline environment causing the gel to become dense or swollen, respectively. This reaction can
be stimulated electrically as was shown by researchers at the University of Arizona, U.S.A. (Liu
and Calvert, 2000). When activated, these gels bend as the cathode side becomes more alkaline and
the anode side more acidic. However, the response of this multilayered gel structure is relatively
slow because of the need to diffuse ions through the gel. A signiﬁcant amount of research and
development efforts and application considerations using ionic gel polymers (IPG) were explored
at the Hokkaido University, Japan (Osada and Kishi, 1989). The polymers that were explored
include electrically induced bending of gels and electrical induced reversible volume change of
gel particles. Further, Schreyer and his coinvestigators at the University of New Mexico,
Albuquerque used a combination of ionic gel and conductive polymer electrodes to demonstrate
an effective EAP actuator (Schreyer et al., 2000; Section 10.6).

10.3.2.2 Ionomeric Polymer–Metal Composites
Ionomeric polymer–metal composites (IPMC) is an EAP that bends in response to an electrical
activation (Figure 10.4) as a result of mobility of cations in the polymer network (Nemat-Nasser
and Thomas, 2004). In 1992, IPMC was realized to have this electroactive characteristic by three
groups of researchers: Oguro et al. (1992) in Japan, as well as Shahinpoor (1992) and Sadeghipour
et al. (1992) in the U.S. The operation as actuators is the reverse process of the charge storage
mechanism associated with fuel cells (Heitner-Wirguin, 1996; Holze and Ahn, 1992). A relatively
low voltage is required to stimulate bending in IPMC, where the base polymer provides channels
for mobility of positive ions in a ﬁxed network of negative ions on interconnected clusters. Two
types of base polymers are widely used to form IPMC: Naﬁon1 (perﬂuorosulfonate made by
DuPont, U.S.A.) and Flemion1 (perﬂuorocarboxylate, made by Asahi Glass, Japan). In order to
chemically electrode the polymer ﬁlms, metal ions (platinum, gold, or others) are dispersed
throughout the hydrophilic regions of the polymer surface and are subsequently reduced to the
corresponding zero-valence metal atoms.
Generally, the ionic content of the IPMC is an important factor in the electromechanical
response of these materials (Bar-Cohen et al., 1999; Nemat-Nasser and Li, 2000). Examining the
bending response shows that using low voltage (1 to 5 V) induces a large bending at frequencies
below 1 Hz, and the displacement signiﬁcantly decreases with the increase in frequency. The
bending response of IPMC was enhanced using Liþ cations that are small and have higher mobility
or large tetra-n-butylammonium cations that transport water in a process that is still being studied.
The actuation displacement of IPMC was further increased using gold metallization as a result of
the higher electrode conductivity (Abe et al., 1998; Oguro et al., 1999).
10.3.2.3 Conductive Polymers
Conductive polymers (CP) typically function via the reversible counter-ion insertion and expulsion
that occurs during redox cycling (Otero et al., 1995; Sansin˜ena and Olazabal, 2004). Oxidation and

reduction occur at the electrodes, inducing a considerable volume change due mainly to the
exchange of ions with an electrolyte. A sandwich of two conductive polymer electrodes (e.g.,
polypyrrole or polyaniline (PAN) doped in HCl) with an electrolyte between them forms an EAP
actuator. When a voltage is applied between the electrodes, oxidation occurs at the anode and
reduction at the cathode. Ions (e.g., Hþ in PAN) migrate and diffuse between the electrolyte and the
electrodes to balance the electric charge. Addition of the ions causes swelling of the polymer and
conversely their removal results in shrinkage and as a result the sandwich bends (Figure 10.5). One
of the parameters that affects the response is the thickness of the layers; thinner layers are faster (as
fast as 40 Hz) (Madden et al., 2000, 2001) but induce lower force. Since strong shear forces act on
the electrolyte layer, attention is needed to protect the material from premature failure. In addition,
actuators made of this type of EAP materials are sensitive to cyclic operation and they tend to
fail after several tens of cycles. Conductive polymer actuators generally require voltages in the
range of 1 to 5 V, and the speed increases with the voltage having relatively high mechanical energy
densities of over 20 J/cm3 but with low efﬁciencies at the level of 1% if no electrical energy is
recovered (Madden et al., 2002).
In recent years, several conductive polymers were reported, including polypyrrole, polyethyle-
nedioxythiophene, poly(p-phenylene vinylene)s, polyanilines, and polythiophenes (Anquetil et al.,
2002). Complexes between polypyrrole and sulfonated detergents offer relatively good stability in
aqueous media, but they are relatively soft compared to other conjugated polymers. Most actuators
that use conductive polymers exploit voltage-controlled swelling to induce bending. Conjugated
polymer microactuators were ﬁrst fabricated at Linko¨pings University, Sweden. Among the devices
that were demonstrated include a miniature box that can be opened and closed electrically (Smela
et al., 1995). Efforts are also being made to develop linear CP actuators where a number of groups
have used polypyrrole for this purpose. The reported actuators were measured to produce a stress of
approximately 5 MPa with moderate strains (~ 2%) (Kaneto et al., 1995). Current efforts at Eamax,
Japan, seem to suggest signiﬁcant increase in the actuation capability that can be obtained using
conductive polymer EAP materials.

10.3.2.4 Carbon Nanotubes
In 1999, carbon nanotubes (CNT) with diamond-like mechanical properties emerged as formal EAP
(Baughman et al., 1999; Spinks et al., 2004). The carbon–carbon bond in nanotubes (NT) that are
suspended in an electrolyte and the change in bond length are responsible for the actuation
mechanism. A network of conjugated bonds connects all carbons and provides a path for the
ﬂow of electrons along the bonds. The electrolyte forms an electric double layer with the nanotubes
and allows injection of large charges that affect the ionic charge balance between the NT and the
electrolyte. The more the charges injected into the bond the larger the dimension changes. Removal
of electrons causes the nanotubes to carry a net positive charge, which is spread across all the carbon
nuclei causing repulsion between adjacent carbon nuclei and increasing the C2C bond length.
Injection of electrons into the bond also causes lengthening of the bond resulting in an increase in
nanotube diameter and length. These dimension changes are translated into macroscopic movement
in the network element of entangled nanotubes and the net result is extension of the CNT.
Considering the mechanical strength and modulus of the individual CNTs and the achievable
actuator displacements, this actuator has the potential of producing higher work per cycle than
any previously reported actuator technologies and of generating much higher mechanical stress.
However, to date such energy densities and forces have not been realized in macro-scale devices.
The material consists of nanometer-size tubes and was shown to induce strains in the range of 1%
along the length. A CNT actuator can be constructed by laminating two narrow strips that are cut
from a CNT sheet using an intermediate adhesive layer, which is electronically insulated. The
resulting ‘‘cantilever device’’ is immersed in an electrolyte such as a sodium chloride solution, and
an electrical connection is made in the form of two nanotube strips. Application of about 1.0 V is
sufﬁcient to cause bending of the actuator, and the direction depends on the polarity of the ﬁeld with
a response that is approximately quadratic relationship between the strain and charge.
10.4
EAP CHARACTERIZATION
Accurate and detailed information about the properties of EAP materials is critical to designers of
related mechanisms or devices. To assess the competitive capability of EAPs, a performance matrix
that consists of comparative performance data is necessary. Such a matrix needs to show the
properties of EAP materials as compared to other classes of actuators, including piezoelectric
ceramic, shape memory alloys, hydraulic actuators, and conventional motors. Studies are currently
underway to deﬁne a uniﬁed matrix and establish effective test capabilities (Sherrit et al., 2004).
Test methods are being developed to allow measurements with minimum effect on the EAP
material. While the electromechanical properties of electronic-type EAP materials can be addressed
with some of the conventional test methods, ionic-type EAPs such as IPMC pose technical
challenges. The response of these materials suffers complexities associated with the mobility of
the cation on the microscopic level, strong dependence on the moisture content, and hysteretic
behavior. Video cameras and image processing softwares allow the study of the deformation of
IPMC strips under various mechanical loads. Simultaneously, the electrical properties and the
response to electrical activation can be measured. Nonlinear behavior has been clearly identiﬁed in
both the mechanical and electrical properties and efforts were made to model this behavior (Sherrit
et al., 2004).
10.5
APPLICATIONS OF EAP
Compared to existing actuators, EAPs have properties that potentially make them very attractive for a
wide variety of biomimetic applications. As polymers, EAP materials can be easily formed in various
276
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

shapes, their properties can be engineered and they can potentially be integrated with microelec-
tromechanical system (MEMS) sensors to produce smart actuators. Unfortunately, the materials that
have been developed so far still exhibit low conversion efﬁciency and are not robust; besides there are
no standard commercial materials available for consideration in practical applications. To be able to
take these materials from the development phase to application as effective actuators, it is necessary
to adequately establish the ﬁeld infrastructure (Bar-Cohen, 2004).
In recent years, signiﬁcant progress has been made in the ﬁeld of EAP towards making practical
actuators, and commercial products are beginning to emerge. The ﬁrst milestone product, a
biomimetic device in the form of a ﬁsh-robot, was announced by Eamax, Japan, at the end of
2002. Moreover, a growing number of organizations are exploring potential applications for EAP
materials, and cooperation across disciplines is helping overcome related challenges. The mech-
anisms and devices that are being considered or developed are applicable to aerospace, automotive,
medical, robotics, exoskeletons, articulation mechanisms, entertainment, animation, toys, clothing,
haptic and tactile interfaces, noise control, transducers, power generators, and smart structures.
Some of the biologically inspired applications of EAP are discussed in the following section.
10.5.1
Artiﬁcial Organs and Other Medical Applications
Considering the use of EAP for artiﬁcial organs requires addressing a number of challenges. These
challenges include biological compatibility — avoiding rejection — and ability to meet the
stringent functional requirements to operate as organ replacements. Currently, electronic EAP
materials seem to be most applicable since they are highly robust and they generate the largest
actuation forces. However, the required voltage range — from hundreds to thousands of voltage —
presents concerns. Even though the electric current is relatively low, the use of high voltage levels
can cause such dangers as producing blood clots or injury due to potential voltage breakdown and
short circuits in the body. On the other hand, the ionic group of EAP materials is chemically
sensitive requiring careful protection. It is also difﬁcult to maintain their static position, particularly
for the IPMC, because these materials involve chemical reaction and even DC voltage causes a
reaction.
Interfacing between human and machine to complement or substitute our senses may enable
important capabilities for medical applications. A number of such interfaces have been investigated
or considered. Of notable signiﬁcance in this area is the ability to interface machines and the human
brain. A development by scientists at Duke University (Wessberg et al., 2000; Mussa-Ivaldi, 2000)
enabled this possibility where electrodes were connected to the brain of a monkey, and using brain
waves, the monkey operated a robotic arm, both locally and remotely via the Internet. Success in
developing EAP-actuated robotic arms with the strength and dexterity to win a wrestling match
against a human opponent (Bar-Cohen, 2004) can greatly beneﬁt from this interface development by
neurologists. Using such a capability to control prosthetics would require feedback to allow the
human operator to ‘‘feel’’ the remote or virtual environment at the artiﬁcial limbs. Such feedback can
be provided with the aid of tactile sensors, haptic devices, and other interfacing mechanisms. Besides
providing feedback, sensors will allow users to protect the prosthetic from potential damage (heat,
pressure, impact, etc.) just as we do our biological limbs. The development of EAP materials that can
provide tactile sensing is currently under way as described in (Bar-Cohen, 2004).
The growing availability of EAP materials that exhibit high actuation displacement and force is
opening new avenues to bioengineering in terms of medical devices for diagnosis, treatment, and
assistance to humans in overcoming different forms of disability. Applications that are currently
being considered include catheter steering mechanism (Della Santa et al., 1996), vein connectors for
repair after surgery (Jager et al., 2000; http://www.micromuscle.com/1024.htm), smart prosthetics
(Herr and Kornbluh, 2004), Braille displays (Bar-Cohen, 2004), and others. Recent research at the
Sungkyunkwan University, Korea, has led to the development of a series of mechanisms and devices
that use dielectric elastomer EAP (Jung et al., 2004). These devices include a smart pill, a tube-like
Artiﬁcial Muscles Using EAP
277

biomimetically moving mechanism with inchworm motion for traveling inside the gastrointestinal
track. The ﬂexible skin of the smart pill was fabricated using a 3-D molding technique.
A photographic view of this smart pill is shown in Figure 10.6. Using dielectric EAP, another
application is currently investigated at the Sungkyunkwan University, Korea, is the development of
a Braille display for the visually impaired. It was designed to be compatible with existing Braille
devices and its performance is under evaluation. Blind patients are given display patterns of letters
and symbols and they are asked to recognize them. A photographic view of the display and its mode
of test with a ﬁnger placed on the device are shown in Figure 10.7. In Figure 10.8, a photographic
view of a blind person testing the new EAP Braille display is seen. The use of dielectric elastomer
EAP for Braille display has also been a subject of study at SRI (Heydt and Chhokkar, 2003;
Kornbluh et al., 2004) where a simple mechanism was constructed taking advantage of the large
strains and high energy density of this EAP material. For this purpose, individually addressable
diaphragm actuators were developed at the scale of Braille dots of: 1.5 mm diameter and 2.3 mm
center-to-center spacing. The resulting 2-mm-diameter diaphragm actuators that were made of
acrylic ﬁlms exhibited pressures of up to 25 kPa (3.7 psi) resulting in 10–25 g of actuation force
on the Braille dot that is needed for easy reading. This approach is scalable to large numbers of cells,
and is expected to enable the building of refreshable displays with many lines of characters at an
affordable price.

10.5.2
EAP-Actuated Biomimetic Robots
With current technology, the appearance and behavior of biological creatures are animated in
various simulation studies, computer generated imagery (CGI), and commercial movies (Blum-
berg, 2003). However, in past years, engineering such biomimetic intelligent creatures as realistic
robots was a signiﬁcant challenge due to the physical and technological constraints and the
shortcomings of available technology. Making robots that can hop and land safely without risking
damage to the mechanism, receive pushes while staying stable or make body and facial expressions
of joy and excitement — which are very natural for humans and animals — are extremely complex
to engineer. The use of AI, effective artiﬁcial muscles, and other biomimetic technologies is
expected to make the possibility of realistically looking and behaving robots into practical engin-
eering models (Bar-Cohen and Breazeal, 2003). Mimicking nature would immensely expand the
collection and functionality of the robots allowing performance of tasks that are impossible with
existing capabilities.
The ﬁeld of artiﬁcial muscles offers many important capabilities for the engineering of robots
that are inspired by biological models and systems. The capability to produce EAP in various
shapes and conﬁgurations can be exploited using such methods as stereolithography and ink-jet
processing techniques. Potentially, a polymer can be dissolved in a volatile solvent and ejected
drop-by-drop onto various substrates. Such rapid prototyping processing methods may lead to
mass-produced robots in full 3D details including the actuators allowing rapid prototyping and
quick transition from concept to full production (Bar-Cohen et al., 2004).
Using EAP actuators, biologically inspired robots may be developed with capabilities that are far
superior to natural creatures since they are not constrained by evolution and survival needs. Examples
may include artiﬁcial bugs that walk, swim, hop, crawl, and dig while reconﬁguring themselves as
needed. An important addition to this capability can be the application of telepresence combined with
virtual reality using haptic interfacing. While such capabilities are expected to signiﬁcantly change
future robots, additional effort is needed to develop robust and effective polymer-based actuators.
Potential actuators may include the dielectric elastomer or the ferroelectric EAP.
To promote the development of effective EAP actuators in support of future development of
such future biomimetic robots, toys, and animatronics, two testbed platforms were developed (see
Figure 10.9). These platforms are available at the author’s JPL’s NDEAA lab and they include an

android head that can make facial expressions and a robotic hand with activatable joints. Currently,
conventional electric motors produce the deformations required for the android to make relevant
facial expressions of the Android. Once effective EAP materials are available they will be modeled
into the head. There they can receive control instructions for the creation of desired facial ex-
pressions. The robotic hand is equipped with sensors for the operation of the various joints and is
capable of mimicking the human hand. The index ﬁnger of this hand is currently being driven by
conventional motors to establish a baseline. The motors would be replaced by EAP when they are
developed as effective actuators.
10.5.2.1 Gripper and Robotic Arm Lifter
To mimic a biological hand using simple elements, the author and his coinvestigators constructed a
miniature robotic arm that was lifted by a rolled dielectric elastomer EAP (Section 10.3.1.1) as a
linear actuator and four IPMC-based ﬁngers as a bending actuator (Chapter 21 in Bar-Cohen, 2004).
The linear actuator was used to raise and drop a graphite or epoxy rod which served as a simplistic
representation of a robotic arm. Unfortunately, after activating this actuator, the arm sustains a
series of oscillations that need to be dampened to allow accurate positioning. This requires sensors
and a feedback loop to support the kinematics of the system control. Several alternatives were
explored, including establishment of a self-sensing capability, but more work is needed before such
an arm can become practical. To produce an end-effector for the arm, a four ﬁnger gripper was
developed (see Figure 10.10). These bending actuator ﬁngers were made of IPMC (Section
10.3.2.2) strips with hooks at the bottom emulating ﬁngernails. As shown in Figure 10.10, this
gripper grabs rocks just like the human hand.
10.5.2.2 Biologically Inspired Robots for Planetary Robotics
The evolution in the capabilities that are inspired by biology has increased to a level where more
sophisticated and demanding ﬁelds, such as space science, are considering the use of such robots.
At JPL, four- and six-legged robots are currently being developed for consideration in future
Figure 10.9 (See color insert following page 302)

missions to such planets as Mars. Such robots include the Limbed Excursion Mobile Utility Robot
(LEMUR) shown in Figure 10.11. These robots are still mobilized by conventional motors. In
contrast, the use of EAP can lead to capabilities that are identiﬁed as biomimetic including running
on complex terrains at the speed of a horse or even a Cheetah.
Such robots would potentially be mobile in complex terrains, acquire and analyze samples, and
perform many other functions that are attributed to legged animals including grasping and object
manipulation. This evolution may potentially lead to the use of life-like robots in future NASA
missions that involve landing on various planets. Equipped with multi-functional tools and multiple
cameras, the LEMUR robots are intended to inspect and maintain installations beyond humanity’s
easy reach in space. This spider-like robot has six legs, each of which has interchangeable end-
effectors to perform the required mission. The radially symmetric layout is a lot like a starﬁsh or
octopus, and it has a panning camera system that allows omni-directional movement and manipu-
lation operations.
The possibility of making an aircraft that ﬂaps its wing as a bird was recently envisioned by
(Colozza et al., 2004) who conceived a ﬂying machine that uses EAP as an actuator supported by
polymeric solar cells on the wings. This solid state aircraft does not use any conventional moving
parts, where the airfoil, propulsion, energy production, energy storage, and control are integrated
into the structure (Figure 10.12). For the purpose of producing the required bending deformation at
low voltage, IPMC-based wings were considered for the development of the concept of Solid State
Aircraft. Using a ﬂight proﬁle similar to a hawk or eagle, the conceived aircraft can potentially soar
for long periods of time and utilize ﬂapping to regain lost altitude. By analyzing the glide and ﬂap
durations, wing length, and distance of travel, it has been determined that a number of design
conﬁgurations can be produced to enable ﬂight over a range of latitudes and times of the year
on Earth, Venus, and possibly Mars. The implementation of this capability will require signiﬁcant
advances in the development of IPMC towards producing signiﬁcantly higher energy efﬁcient
actuators.

MILESTONE FOR THE FIELD
Improved collaboration among developers, users, and sponsors as well as increased resources with
a growing number of investigators have led to rapid progress in the ﬁeld. In the last two years
several milestones have been made in this ﬁeld:
(a)
In December 2002, the ﬁrst commercial product emerged in the form of a Fish-Robot (Eamex,
Japan). An example of this Fish-Robot can be seen at http://eap.jpl.nasa.gov where there is also a
link to a video showing Fish-Robots swimming in a ﬁsh tank. These robots swim without batteries
or motor and use EAP materials that simply bend on stimulation. For power they use inductive coils
that are energized from the top and bottom of the ﬁsh tank.
In 1999, in an effort to promote worldwide development towards the realization of the potential
of EAP materials an arm wrestling challenge was posed to the engineers worldwide (Bar-Cohen,

2001). Success in developing such an arm will lead to the possible use of EAP to replace damaged
human muscles, that is making ‘‘bionic human.’’ A remarkable contribution of the EAP ﬁeld would
be to see, one day, a handicapped person jogging to the grocery store using this technology.
A graphic rendering of this challenge that was posed by the author is illustrated in Figure 10.13.
The intent of posing this challenge was to use the human arm as a baseline for the implementation
of the advances in the development of EAP materials. Success in wrestling against humans will
enable biomimetic capabilities that are currently considered impossible. It would allow applying
EAP materials to improve many aspects of our life where some of the possibilities include smart
implants and prosthetics (also known as cyborgs), active clothing (de Rossi et al., 1997), realistic
biologically inspired robots as well as fabricating products with unmatched capabilities. Recent
advances in understanding the behavior of EAP materials and the improvement of their efﬁciency
led to the historical ﬁrst competition held in March 2005. In this competition, three robotic arms
participated and the human opponent was a 17-year-old female student. The three arms were made
by Environmental Robots Incorporated (ERI), New Mexico; Swiss Federal Laboratories for
Materials Testing and Research, EMPA, Dubendorf, Switzerland; and three senior students from
the Engineering Science and Mechanics Department, Virginia Tech.
1.
The arm that was made by Environmental Robots Incorporated (ERI), New Mexico held for 26 sec
against the 17-year-old student. This wrestling arm (see Figure 10.14) had the size of an average
human arm and it was made of polypropylene and Derlin. This arm was driven by two groups of
artiﬁcial muscle. One group consisted of dielectric elastomeric resilient type that was used to
maintain an equilibrium force and the other was composed of ionic polymer–metal composites
(IPMC) type strips that ﬂex to increase or decrease the main resilient force.
2.
The Materials Testing and Research, EMPA, Dubendorf, Switzerland, arm (see Figure 10.15) held
for 4 sec before losing. This arm was driven by the dielectric elastomer type using multi-layered
scrolled actuators that were organized in four groups. A photo of one of the group lifting two
5-gallon water containers (about 20-kg) is shown in Figure 10.16. Using electronic control, these
actuators were operated similar to human muscles, where two of these groups acted as protagonists
and the other two operated as antagonists. The arm had an outer shell made of ﬁberglass that was
used as a shield for the electric section. The arm structure was made of composite sandwich
consisting of ﬁberglass and carbon ﬁbers.

The arm that was made by the three senior students from the Engineering Science and Mechanics
Department, Virginia Tech (see Figure 10.17) managed to last 3 sec. As an EAP actuator they
constructed batches of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) gel ﬁbers that were designed to operate as artiﬁcial
muscles. This EAP material was shown experimentally to produce close to 200% linear strain and

pulling strength that is higher than human muscles (Schreyer et al., 2000). To encase the ﬁbers and
chemicals that make up their EAP actuator, they designed an electrochemical cell. For the skeleton
of the arm they used a structure that is made of composite material and, for support, this structure
was connected to an aluminum base.
This competition has been a very important milestone for the ﬁeld and helped accomplish the goals
of this challenge, namely:
1.
promote advances towards making EAP actuators that are superior to the performance of human
muscles;
2.
increase the worldwide visibility and recognition of EAP materials;
3.
attract interest among potential sponsors and users;
4.
lead to general public awareness since it is hoped that they will be the end users and beneﬁciaries in
many areas including medical, commercial, and other ﬁelds.

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
For many years, EAP received relatively little attention due to their limited actuation capability and
the small number of available materials. In the last 15 years, a series of new EAP materials have
emerged that exhibit large displacement in response to electrical stimulation. The capability of
these new materials is making them attractive as actuators for their operational similarity to
biological muscles, particularly their resilience, damage tolerance, and ability to induce large
actuation strains (stretching, contracting, or bending). The application of these materials as
actuators to drive various manipulation, mobility, and robotic devices involves multi-disciplines
including materials, chemistry, electromechanics, computers, and electronics. Even though the
force of actuation of existing EAP materials and their robustness require further improvement, there
has already been a series of reported successes in the development of EAP-actuated mechanisms.
Successful devices that have been reported include a ﬁsh-robot, audio speakers, catheter-steering
element, miniature manipulator and gripper, active diaphragm, and dust wiper. The ﬁeld of EAP
has enormous potential in many application areas, and, judging from the range of inquiries that the
author has received since his start in this ﬁeld in 1995, it seems that almost any aspect of our lives
can potentially be impacted. Some of the considered applications are still far from being practical,
and it is important to tailor the requirements to the level that current materials can address. Using
EAP to replace existing actuators may be a difﬁcult challenge and therefore it is highly desirable
to identify niche applications where EAP materials would not need to compete with existing
technologies.
Space applications are among the most demanding in terms of the harshness of the operating
conditions, requiring a high level of robustness and durability. Making biomimetic capability using
EAP material will potentially allow NASA to conduct missions in other planets using robots that
emulate human operation ahead of a landing of human. For an emerging technology, the require-
ments and challenges associated with making hardware for space ﬂight are very difﬁcult to
overcome. However, since such applications usually involve producing only small batches, they
can provide an important avenue for introducing and experimenting with new actuators and

match against Panna Felsen, the 17-year-old student from San Diego.

devices. This is in contrast to commercial applications, for which issues of mass production,
consumer demand, and cost per unit can be critical to the transfer of technology to practical use.
Some of the challenges that are facing the users of EAP materials in expanding their potential
applications to space include their capability to respond at low or high temperatures.
Space applications are of great need for materials that can operate at single digit degrees of
Kelvin or at temperatures as high as hundreds of Celsius as on Venus. Another challenge to EAP
is the development of large scale EAP in the form of ﬁlms, ﬁbers, and others. The required
dimensions can be as large as several meters or kilometers and in such dimensions they can be
used to produce large gossamer structures such as antennas, solar sails, and various large optical
components.
In order to exploit the highest beneﬁts from EAP, multidisciplinary international cooperative
efforts need to grow further among scientists, engineers, and other experts (e.g., medical doctors,
etc.). Experts in chemistry, materials science, electromechanics or robotics, computer science,
electronics, etc., need to advance the understanding of the material behavior, as well as develop
EAP materials with enhanced performance, processing techniques, and applications. Effective
feedback sensors and control algorithms are needed to address the unique and challenging aspects
of EAP actuators. If EAP-driven artiﬁcial muscles can be implanted into a human body, this
technology can make a tremendously positive impact on many human lives.
This ﬁeld of EAP is far from mature and progress is expected to change the ﬁeld in future
years. Recent technology advances led to the development of three EAP-actuated robotic arms
that wrestled with a 17-year-old female student who was the human opponent in the competition
held on March 7, 2005. Even though the 17-year-old student won against the three arms
the competition helped increase the visibility of the ﬁeld worldwide and the recognition of
its potential. While more work is needed to reach the level of winning against humans it is
inevitable that this would happen just like the chess game between the champion and the
Big Blue IBM computer (http://www.geocities.com/siliconValley/lab/7378/comphis.htm). Ini-
tially, the challenge is to win a wrestling match against a human (any human) using a simple
shape arm with minimum functionality. However, the ultimate goal is to win against the strongest
human using as close as possible a resemblance of the shape and performance of the human arm.
Once such a robotic arm wins against humans, it would become clear that EAP performance has
reached a level where devices can be designed and produced with the many physical functions of
humans with far superior capability. Such a success is one of the ultimate goals of the ﬁeld of
biomimetics.

INTRODUCTION
Of the ﬁve senses, the mechanism of sight is perhaps the most diverse in the animal kingdom. There
exist at least eight generalized types of optical systems with numerous variations within each
classiﬁcation. This is to be expected, as each animal-eye is tailored to the speciﬁc needs of its
owner. From the defense-oriented pinhole clam eye to the night-adapted owl eye, nature has
provided a plethora of examples to study and emulate.
The ability to reproduce biological optical systems using man-made materials has applications
in navigation systems, specialized detectors, and in surveillance cameras. Of late, there has been
particular interest within the military which has provided much of the funding towards research in
this ﬁeld. Advancements in materials science and manufacturing technologies have shown to be
invaluable in the construction of biomimetic optics.
Biomimetic optics is a relatively new and expanding ﬁeld, although it can be argued that older
technologies such as photographic cameras already mimic biology by having analogous structures
(i.e., glass lens to biological lens, ﬁlm to retina, etc.). However, this chapter is devoted to those
optical devices, which, by their design, seek to imitate living organisms. The examples that follow
291

offer a survey of the ever-increasing attempts to reconstruct biological eyes. They are roughly
divided by the general classiﬁcations of the eyes they seek to replicate; that is, they are separated
into biomimetic camera (single lens) eyes, compound eyes, and others.
11.2
CAMERA EYES
Certainly the most familiar example, the human eye is but one of many forms of camera-type eyes
and generally relies on a single lens to focus images onto a retina for image acquisition. The lens
material properties, structure, and focusing mechanism vary from organism to organism. For
example, some amphibian species have eyes which accommodate by moving a lens closer or
farther to the retina. By contrast, the human eye adjusts the curvature of the lens itself to accomplish
the same task. Birds have the added beneﬁt of being able to reshape the cornea as well as the lens for
accommodation. Some of the various camera eye designs are shown below (Figure 11.1).
These natural eyes have provided the inspiration for a number of optical systems with speciﬁc
capability requirements. These include different approaches for adaptive optics, efﬁcient image
processing, and size-constrained wide-angle views.
11.2.1
A Fluidic Adaptive Lens
Some forms of camera eyes, oftentimes in amphibious animals, use hydraulics to adjust their focal
lengths. A chamber behind the lens is ﬁlled or emptied with ﬂuid depending on the desired focus
(Figure 11.2). One example of this is the whale eye, where this design allows for good vision both
in and out of the water. In addition, the ﬂuid also compensates for increased pressure at deeper
aquatic environments.

mammalian ciliary muscle allows for passive changes in lens thickness. Brucke’s muscles attached to bony
ossicles in reptiles and birds, on the other hand, actively change the lens thickness. Birds have an additional
muscle, Crampton’s muscle, which can alter the shape of the cornea. The protractor lentis in some amphibian eyes
moves a ﬁxed-shape lens closer to or farther from the retina for accommodation.

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

By using similar principles, Zhang et al. (2003) at the University of California at San Diego have
created an adaptive ﬂuidic lens. The lens itself is made of an inexpensive polymer, polydimethyl-
siloxane (PDMS), processed using soft lithography to include a ﬂuid chamber and injection port.
The 60-mm thick PDMS membrane is then bonded to a glass substrate using oxygen plasma
bonding technology. By ﬁlling the chamber, Zhang et al. were able to demonstrate a focal length
range from 41 to 172 mm, with corresponding numerical aperture values of 0.24 to 0.058. The
highest recorded resolution was 25.39 lp/mm in both horizontal and perpendicular directions. These
results are shown in Figure 11.3.
This unique design allows for a variable focal length system in a rather compact and robust
arrangement. It should be noted, however, that it may be possible to improve upon their design by
studying nature further. It is well known that a homogenous spherical lens will suffer from spherical
aberration, when the peripheral light rays are refracted more than the axial ones. In the biological
world, this problem has been managed in two ways. The ﬁrst, and most appropriate to this design, is
to have a nonspherical proﬁle such that the periphery of the lens is ﬂatter than the center. By
following nature’s example again, Zhang et al. may achieve even better results.
11.2.2
An Artiﬁcial Cephalopod Eye
As alluded to in the previous section, there is a second method nature has used to deal with spherical
aberration (Land, 1988). This involves the use of a ball lens with a spherically-symmetric refractive
index gradient that decreases from the center outwards (Figure 11.4).
This is a particularly
appropriate adaptation to the watery habitat of cephalopods, such as octopi and squid. Such an
environment necessitates that the entire focusing power of the eye lie within the lens itself, as both
sides of the cornea consist of essentially the same medium. In this arrangement, a spherical lens
provides the shortest possible focal length. The result is a wide ﬁeld of view from a relatively
compact apparatus.
The theory that cephalopods use a spherical lens with a refractive index gradient was initially
postulated in the latter half of the 1800s, ﬁrst by Maxwell and later by Matthiessen (Land, 1988).
Indeed, it was Matthiessen who determined that the ratio of the focal length to the lens radius is
approximately 2.5 (‘‘Matthiessen’s ratio’’) in animals with lenses of this design. A precise math-
ematical description of the gradient was not established until 1944 (Luneberg, 1944), followed by a
numerical solution in 1953 (Fletcher, 1953). Still, it was not until 33 years later that Koike et al.
created an artiﬁcial ball lens with the required index of refraction gradient (Koike et al., 1986).
Besides the lens, construction of an artiﬁcial cephalopod eye involves a critical design issue.
The retinas of many animals including cephalopods are curved structures, whereas man-made
photodetector arrays are ﬂat. This has much to do with the way electronics are manufactured in
general, on ﬂat semiconductor surfaces. Hung et al. (2004) have overcome this limitation by

fabricating a unique array where individual photodetectors are connected by ﬂexible structures on
top of a PDMS polymer substrate. These S-ﬂexures are a key requirement in the development of an
artiﬁcial cephalopod eye, as each pixel remains connected to those around it while allowing a
ﬂexible, curve retina (Figure 11.5).
While research is ongoing, it is apparent that the development of this type of optical system will
allow for a much wider ﬁeld of view (180 to 2008) than conventional cameras. At the same time, the
device will maintain a compact arrangement, allowing for space-efﬁcient implementation in
various applications.
11.2.3
A Foveated Imaging System
A ﬁnal example of a camera-type system borrows more from the strategy of certain living organisms
than from the design. A commonly observed trait in animals is the ability to scan a scene in order to
increase their ﬁeld of view. Many animals, including humans, have a much higher resolution in the

center of their ﬁeld of view than towards the periphery. This is known as foveated imaging and
allows for a relatively wide angle of view with the option of detailed resolution by scanning.
Optical engineers are often faced with a similar challenge of increasing the ﬁeld of view while
maintaining resolution. Traditional methods include decreasing the entrance pupil size (which
increases the f/# at the expense of resolving power and illumination) and adding optical elements
(increasing the complexity, size, and weight of the system). Martinez et al. (2001) have devised an
artiﬁcial foveated viewing system as a unique solution.
Their design uses liquid crystal spatial light modulators (SLM), which are used to manipulate
optical wavefronts. Voltages applied to liquid crystals alter the index of refraction such that
aberrations are corrected. However, only aberrations from a limited range of angles can be
corrected at one time (Figure 11.6). Rays of light from different ﬁeld angles are not corrected,
and the result is a region of high resolution surrounded by areas of low resolution.
By appropriately varying the SLM, the optical system effectively scans with a narrow ﬁeld of
view of high resolution while maintaining peripheral vision much like the human eye. An additional
beneﬁt of this optical system is a decreased bandwidth requirement for transmitting digital images,
as only a portion of the entire ﬁeld of view has high resolution. The low resolution areas may serve a
purpose as well; they may be used as an initial assessment of whether an area warrants high
resolution probing.
11.3
COMPOUND EYES
The appeal of insect compound eyes may be due, in part, to their being so different than our own.
On the surface they also appear to be more diverse and complex with anywhere from a single
ommatidium (individual eye unit) in the ant species Pomera punctatissima to over 10,000 per eye in
some species of dragonﬂies. Again, the various manifestations of compound eyes are customized to
the needs of their users. In general, compound eyes are broadly divided into two categories,
superpositional and appositional.
The individual facets of appositional compound eyes are optically isolated, and each of them
provides part of a scene. The result is a series of images slightly offset from one another (see Figure
11.7). The advantage of this arrangement is that the images are processed in parallel, leading to

very fast image recognition and motion detection. However, this comes at the expense of the
brightness of the image, as only a limited amount of light is captured.
By contrast, the facets of superpositional compound eyes are not optically isolated, and, as their
name would indicate, form images from the superposition of their respective light rays (see Figure
11.8). The light rays fall from multiple lenses onto a shared retina, with a concomitant increase in
photosensitivity. Surprisingly, these eyes form a single erect image, which can be accomplished by
cleverly designed refractive index gradients or mirrors.
In terms of biomimetic engineering, it seems that the appositional arrangement is vastly more
popular than the superpositional. This may be due to the relative conceptual simplicity in setting up
multiple cameras versus coordinating multiple lenses on a shared retina. Still, as will be discussed
later, the superpositional compound eye is well adapted for certain ﬁelds and successes there may
spur increased interest.
11.3.1
Appositional Compound Eyes
In the early 1990s, Ogata et al. (1994) fabricated an artiﬁcial compound eye and integrated electronic
retina by taking advantage of integrated circuit technologies at the time. Their design used planar
arrays (16  16) of gradient index of refraction rods (GRIN rods) which focused light through
pinholes onto a photodetector array (with eight shades of gray scale). The pinholes acted as lens-
isolating elements and the arrangement of the arrays in a circle increased the available ﬁeld of view.
The image output was decidedly pixelated, but this modest beginning has led to modern versions with
increased resolution and color capabilities (Figure 11.9) (Tanida et al., 2003; Duparre et al., 2004).
Continuing with the theme of nonﬂat surfaces from their cephalopod eye design, Jeong et al.
(2005) have also developed a number of appositional compound eyes arranged spherically. More
faithful to biological designs than previous work, these eyes contain separate ommatidia, each with
its own lens, waveguide, and photoreceptor. The difﬁculties lie primarily with shaping the polymers
appropriately. Hemispherical substrates are produced by natural surface tension forces on droplets
of liquid polymer which are then allowed to cure onto a ﬂexible membrane. A micromolded lenslet

array is then superimposed upon this substrate, allowing for each lenslet to be facing a different
radial direction. Subsequent exposure to light through the lenslets provides a method for deﬁning
the corresponding waveguides (Figure 11.10). The individual lenslets have been shown to have
comparable ﬁelds of view to natural compound eyes.
Researchers in Israel have recently been developing an artiﬁcial version of a subset of the
appositional compound eye. To biologists, it is known somewhat confusingly, as the neural super-
positional eye. While the ommatidia are optically isolated from one another, the information from
each one is superimposed through neural processing (Figure 11.11).
In this way, the images
obtained from multiple facets are compared in order to increase sensitivity. The structure is slightly
different than the pure appositional eye described previously.
Rosen and Abookasis (2003) have taken this approach to develop a sensor capable of imaging
through scattering media such as biological tissue. Coherent light is projected through a biological
sample to a microlens array. Each microlens detects a unique speckle pattern and summation of
these patterns reveal an outline of interior structures of the sample. Rosen et al. have demonstrated
the ability to image bony arrangements placed between two slices of muscle tissue (Figure 11.12).
While still in its initial stages, this technology has the potential for low-cost, safe, and noninvasive
medical diagnoses.
11.3.2
Superpositional Compound Eyes
One of the most famous examples of biologically inspired optics comes from a paper written in
1979, entitled ‘‘Lobster eyes as x-ray telescopes’’ (Angel, 1979). As described in various papers of
the time, lobster eyes consist of tapered tubes having rectangular cross-sections and reﬂective
interior surfaces (Figure 11.13). These tubes are arranged spherically, and light reﬂecting twice
from the interior surfaces behaves identically to a spherical mirror. The tubes share a common
retina making the lobster eye a superpositional compound eye (Figure 11.14).
Roger Angel theorized that such a mechanism could be adapted for x-ray telescopes if each
cell could be made with an aspect ratio of approximately 100. Conventional x-ray telescopes

use concave mirrors, but the majority of x-rays pass through unaffected. Only at glancing angles
are x-rays reﬂected in this manner, leaving conventional x-ray telescopes with only a 18 ﬁeld of
view. A lobster eye design, on the other hand, has the potential for a nearly unlimited ﬁeld of view.
However, interest waned until Australian scientists revived the idea in 1989 and research
began in earnest for a working device. While these attempts have not yet come to fruition, support
for the concept of using lobster eyes has spread internationally and expanded to include
satellite astronomy (Peele et al., 1996) and computer microchip processing (Chown, 1996a,b).
Peele et al. have demonstrated x-ray focusing using microchannel plates manufactured by
LIGA (lithographie, galvanoformung, abformung) processing of poly-methyl-methacrylate
(PMMA). In the case of microchip technology, the lobster eye design is used in reverse to produce
parallel x-rays (Figure 11.15). Traditionally, circuit linewidths are deﬁned by light, with shorter
wavelengths allowing smaller electronics. The wavelengths of x-rays are well-suited to this
application, but it has proven difﬁcult to generate parallel x-rays. The lobster eye design may be
a feasible solution.

11.3.3
Hybrid Appositional or Superpositional Compound Eyes
In 2004, Szema et al. z proposed a new kind of compound eye based on both the superpositional and
appositional arrangements. While not found in nature, the design attempts to combine the advan-
tages of both types of systems. It begins with a standard superpositional compound eye modiﬁed by
attaching optical shutters to each of the facets. In this way, images are acquired from individual
ommatidia separately, as in the appositional arrangement. However, the use of a single retina
simulates the superpositional compound eye.
Such a design not only reduces bandwidth and parallel processing requirements, but also has an
additionaladvantagebyrecovering usefulinformationthatislost inatypical superpositional arrange-
ment.Namely,whenimagesfrommultiplelensesareprojectedsimultaneouslyontoacommonretina,
it is difﬁcult to correlate image points to their originating facets (see Figure 11.16). This is signiﬁcant
becausebyknowingtherelativepositionofthelensesandtheobjects intheirrespective ﬁelds ofview,
it is possible to derive three-dimensional information (Figure 11.17).

As humans can triangulate depth from the ﬁelds of view of two eyes, a compound eye may prove
to be even more adept at discerning distances and dimensional measurements. This is because the
distances measured are based on calculations using multiple data points, decreasing the error of any
pair of eyes alone. This has applications in robotic navigation systems, surveillance cameras, and
borescopic devices.
11.4
OTHER BIOMIMETIC APPROACHES
This section deals with biomimetic engineering approaches to optics which do not ﬁt easily into the
categories of camera or compound eyes. While the ﬁrst two examples of brittlestar microlenses and
Melanophila acuminate beetle pit organs may seem simplistic relative to the other eye designs, they
are no less suited for their applications. In addition, it is important that ‘‘simple’’ is not confused
with ‘‘easily replicated’’ or even ‘‘easily understood.’’ Indeed, the idea of image formation by
projection from a lens onto a retina was noted by Johannes Kepler in 1604. But, as described below,
it was not until 2001 that scientists even recognized that the brittlestar had eyes, let alone was
covered with them.
11.4.1
Brittlestar Eyes
By all accounts, the brittlestar is a curious creature (see Figure 11.18). In particular, the species
Ophiocoma wendtii demonstrates marked photosensitivity and the ability to evade predators, all
without readily apparent eyes or a brain. In a letter published in 2001, Aizenberg et al. (2001)
reported that, in fact, the calcite crystals embedded throughout the skeletal structure were the
elements of an enveloping compound eye. The crystals, 40 to 50 mm in diameter, appear to form
doublet lenses with the ability to correct for spherical aberration and birefringence. In addition, the
focal point of the lenses is approximately 4 to 7 mm with a 3-mm spot size. This matches nerve
bundle locations and sizes beneath the calcite crystal array, supplying evidence to the notion that
the array forms a pixelated image of its surroundings.
Bell Laboratories or Lucent Technologies have used this discovery to design process ﬂows for
artiﬁcial lenses which also limit birefringence and spherical aberration effects. This may have
applications in optical networking equipment and improved photolithography techniques. By organ-
ically modifying micropatterned templates, researchers are able to direct the growth of single calcite
crystals into sub-10-mm patterns and deﬁned crystallographic orientation (Aizenberg et al., 2003).
Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of v-terminated alkanethiols on gold or silver supports are
used as crystallization templates, and organic posts can be added without upsetting single-crystal
growth. These posts allow for removing water and impurities during the transition from an

amorphous calcium carbonate phase to the crystalline phase. The result is a large, microporous
single crystal. Light microscopy images of the crystallization process, as well as infrared spectral
response of the crystals, are shown below (Figure 11.19).
11.4.2
Melanophila acuminate Beetle
Yet another interesting animal, the M. acuminate beetle, has the uncanny ability to ﬁnd forest ﬁre
areas for breeding purposes. Females of this species lay their eggs in burnt wood, where the natural
defense mechanisms of living trees are absent. This is the only place their larvae can survive. While
M. acuminate is not the only creature with this practice, it is often the ﬁrst to arrive, sometimes
outpacing other insects by weeks to months (Sowards et al., 2001).
M. acuminate are guided by specialized structures, known as pit organs, which are more
sensitive to the frequency of infrared light emitted by forest ﬁres (Figure 11.20). These organs
(450 mm  200 mm  108 mm deep) house 50 to 100 sensilla (each 15 mm in diameter). Following
infrared light absorption, the expansion of a cuticular apparatus is detected by mechanoreceptors
which direct the beetles to the ﬁre (Sowards et al., 2001).
Equivalent man-made guidance systems, heat-seeking missiles, for example, rely on sensors
that need to be cooled to freezing temperatures at signiﬁcant cost. Schmitz et al. have been working
on adapting insights gleaned from analyzing the M. acuminate beetle for use in similar applications
(Roach, 2004). Their design uses a disc which expands in response to infrared radiation. The
composition of the disc depends on the infrared source, with examples such as Teﬂon for heat from
a human hand or polyethelene for ﬁre detection. Currently, the mechanosensors used are able to
detect a source 30 to 40 cm away. The sensitivity is expected to increase greatly with more sensitive
mechanosensors and tailored disc materials.
11.5
CONCLUSION
When it comes to designing optical systems, humans have been unquestionably creative. Still, it has
not been until relatively recently that there has been a major thrust towards biologically inspired
optics. Of the multitude of natural vision systems that exist, only a relative few have been emulated
using man-made materials. And it is probably safe to say that none of these artiﬁcial systems have
matched the performance of their biological counterparts.

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

The goal of biomimetic devices, however, should not be merely to imitate nature. Rather,
devices should be designed according to their application with biology providing a valuable
resource for consultation. Nature should be used to improve human designs. This will involve an
increasing collaboration between biologists and engineers so that, eventually, we may improve
upon nature’s designs as well (Figure 11.21).

INTRODUCTION
Multifunctional structural materials possess attributes beyond the basic strength and stiffness that
typically drive the science and engineering of the material for structural systems. Structural
materials can be designed to have integrated electrical, magnetic, optical, locomotive, power
generative, and possibly other functionalities that work in synergy to provide advantages that
309

reach beyond that of the sum of the individual capabilities. Materials of this kind have tremendous
potential to impact future structural performance by reducing size, weight, cost, power consump-
tion, and complexity while improving efﬁciency, safety, and versatility.
Nature offers numerous examples of materials that serve multiple functions. Biological
materials routinely contain sensing, healing, actuation, and other functions built into the primary
structures of an organism. The human skin, for instance (see Figure 12.1), consists of many layers of
cells, each of which contains oil and perspiration glands, sensory receptors, hair follicles, blood
vessels, and other components with functions other than providing the basic structure and protection
for the internal organs. These structures have evolved in nature over eons to the level of seamless
integration and perfection with which they serve their functions. Scientists now seek to mimic these
material systems in designing synthetic multifunctional materials using physics, chemistry, and
mathematics to their advantage in competing with the unlimited time frame of nature’s evolutionary
design process. The multifunctionality of these materials often occurs at scales that are nano through
macro and on various temporal and compositional levels.
12.1.1
Multifunctional Concepts
In recent years, wide arrays of multifunctional material systems have been proposed. Each of these
systems has sought to integrate at least one other function into a material that is capable of bearing
mechanical loads and serves as a structural material element. Researchers at ITN Energy Systems
and SRI International have integrated a power-generating function into ﬁber-reinforced composites
(Christodoulou and Venables, 2003). Individual ﬁbers are coated with cathodic, electrolytic, and
anodic forming layers to create a battery. The use of the surface area of ﬁbers as opposed to that of a
foil in a thin ﬁlm battery allows greater energy outputs, measured on the order of 50 Wh/kg in a
carbon ﬁber-reinforced epoxy laminate. These batteries may be deposited on various substrates,
including glass, carbon, and metallic ﬁbers. This research and many others, including our own
research, have been supported by DARPA under the ﬁrst generation of Synthetic Multifunctional
Materials Initiative (Figure 12.2).
Other power-generating schemes integrated into structural composites have been proposed,
where the composite structure is consumed to generate power after its structural purpose is
complete (Joshi et al., 2002; Thomas et al., 2002; Baucom et al., 2004; Qidwai et al., 2004).
Physical Sciences Inc. have incorporated oxidizers into thermoplastic matrix composites and
demonstrated signiﬁcant energy output from directly burning the material (Joshi et al., 2002).
Such a material would be useful for instance in a space application, where weight saving is critical,
and structures required only for launch could provide an energy source once the structure is no longer
needed.

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

The integration of sensing into materials has made many advances in recent years. Much of the
research has been conducted under the context of Structural Health Monitoring, or SHM. In line
with the overall theme of this book, researchers seek to make a material sense its environment, feel
internal damage, and signal an alert that repair is needed, essentially mimicking the behavior of
biological organisms. Later in this chapter we provide an approach to integrating sensing into
composite materials. For a comprehensive overview of the ﬁeld, the reader is directed to a recent
review paper on the subject (Mal, 2004).
This brief introduction to multifunctional materials only scratches the surface of the various
multifunctional concepts developed to date. The remaining sections of this chapter will detail a
further example of a multifunctional material under development at University of California, San
Diego (UCSD), in the ﬁrst author’s laboratories. The functionalities of this material include
integrated structural, electromagnetic, thermal, healing, and sensing capabilities. While this ma-
terial in no way encompasses all of the possible functionalities that may be integrated into a
material, it offers an example of how such an integration may be achieved while maintaining the
structural integrity of the overall material. Particular attention is given to the interplay and resulting
synergy between the various elements that contribute these functionalities.
12.2
MULTIFUNCTIONAL COMPOSITES
We focus on the issues that relate to integrating multiple functions into ﬁber-reinforced
polymers to create composites with basic structural attributes that can also perform other functions.
We discuss various methods that have been used to control the mechanical, electromag-
netic (EM), and thermal properties of the material, while introducing self-healing, and environ-
mental-sensing and prognostic capabilities into the material. The polymer matrix of these
composites has the ability to covalently heal microcracks at rates that can be facilitated by
moderate heating through thin conductors which are also used to control the EM properties of
the material. The same conductors can also be used to create sensor-integrated electronic
networks within the composite, capable of sensing, and local and global communications and
decision making.

12.2.1
Electromagnetic Functionality
Recent advances in electromagnetic (EM) metamaterials have provided an opportunity to change
and tune the dielectric constant as well as the index of refraction of the material over a range of
useful frequencies. Electromagnetic metamaterials are artiﬁcially structured media with unique and
distinct EM properties that are not observed in naturally occurring materials. A variety of meta-
materials with striking EM properties have been introduced, most notably those with a negative
refractive index (NRI). NRI is associated with a medium of simultaneously negative electric
permittivity, « and the magnetic permeability, m. There are no known conventional materials
with such exceptional properties. Recently, Smith et al. (2000a,b) at UCSD have produced a
medium with effective « and m that are measured to be simultaneously negative. Later, Smith
et al. performed a Snell’s law experiment on a similar metamaterial wedge sample, and demon-
strated the negative refraction of a microwave beam (Shelby et al., 2001). Thus they showed that
their medium does indeed possess an NRI, that is, it is a negative index material (NIM). Such a
property has been hypothesized by Veselago who termed the medium ‘‘left-handed’’ (Veselago,
1968). The work on controlling the dielectric constant and producing negative « and m has been
discussed by Smith et al. (Smith et al., 2002, 2003, 2004a,b,c; Kolinko and Smith, 2003; Pendry
et al., 2003). However, until recently, the NIMs produced have been experimental samples, suitable
only for proof-of-concept demonstrations.
Based on the calculation of the effective EM properties of a medium containing period-
ically distributed very thin conducting wires and electric resonators, the authors at UCSD have
introduced into structural composites electromagnetic enhancements in the form of tunable index
of refraction, radio frequency (RF) absorption, and when desired, a negative index of refraction
(Starr et al. 2004). Such properties are the result of embedding periodic metal scattering elements
into the material to create an effective medium response over desired RF frequency ranges. We have
identiﬁed two wire architectures, namely thin straight wire arrays and coiled wire arrays, that are
suitable for direct integration into ﬁber-reinforced composites (Nemat-Nasser et al., 2002). These
arrays act as inductive media with a plasma-like response to control the electric permittivity. As a
result, the dielectric constant may be tuned to negative or positive values. Such a medium may be
used as a window to ﬁlter electromagnetic radiation. When the dielectric constant is negative, the
material does not transmit incident radiation. As the dielectric constant approaches to and exceeds
the turn-on frequency, the incident EM radiation is transmitted through the composite. Further-
more, over a desired frequency range, the dielectric constant may be tuned to match that of the
surrounding environment. For instance, the dielectric constant may be tuned to match that of air,
with a dielectric constant of unity, such that incident radiation does not experience a difference
when encountering the composite.

suggested an artiﬁcial plasmon medium composed of a periodic arrangement of very thin conducting
wires, predicting a plasma frequency in the microwave regime, below the diffraction limit. Recently,
other researchers have presented examples of artiﬁcial plasmon media at microwave frequencies
(Smith et al., 1999). The dielectric constant k of a dilute neutral plasma is given by

where c0 denotes the speed of light in vacuum, d is the lattice spacing, and r is the radius of the wires
(Pendry et al., 1996). Straight wire arrays, such as those shown in Figure 12.3, are designed such
that the radius of the wires is very small compared to the lattice spacing, so that the wavelength of
the electromagnetic excitation frequency is large compared to the lattice size. For the medium to
behave as a plasma at microwave frequencies, for instance, the wire radius must be on the order of
tens of micrometers and spaced on the order of centimeters. To integrate such electromagnetic

designs into materials, one needs a periodic material that can accommodate the arrangement of the
wire elements. Fiber-reinforced polymer composites facilitate such arrangements due to the natural
periodicity of their ﬁber and laminate construction. The arrangement of ﬁbers within each layer
provides ﬂexibility in orientation, spacing, and geometry of the conducting wire elements. Each
layer may contain elements with orientation in only one direction, as in a uni-directional laminate,
or the elements may be woven such that each layer has bi-directional elements. Variation of the
spacing of these elements in the thickness (z) dimension of the material is controlled by the
sequence in which laminates are stacked to form the laminate.
As an example, we have introduced arrays of thin, straight wires into various types of composite
materials. Composite panels were made by hand-layup of preimpregnated woven fabric (prepreg).
The samples varied in the type of host material, wire diameter, and number of electromagnetic
layers. Host materials included E-glass ﬁbers impregnated with epoxy resin, Spectra1 (Honeywell
UHMW polyethylene) ﬁbers impregnated with vinyl ester resin, and quartz ﬁbers impregnated with
cyanate ester resin, chosen for their mechanical attributes and favorable dielectric characteristics.
The dielectric constant of epoxy/E-glass was 4.44 at microwave frequencies with a loss tangent of
0.01, and that of vinyl ester/Spectra was 2.45 with a loss tangent of 0.002. Cyanate ester/quartz
provided the best overall electromagnetic characteristics with a dielectric constant of 3.01 and a
loss tangent of 0.001, where a low dielectric constant and loss tangent are preferable for optimal
microwave transmission. The ﬁber volume fraction for each material was about 60%. The fre-
quency at which the panels behave as plasma depends upon the dimensions of the embedded wire
array. Numerical simulations were performed to predict the necessary array for plasma response in
the microwave regime. In making each panel, copper wire of 75 or 50 mm diameter was strung
across a frame to form the desired pattern and was subsequently encased in layers of prepreg. Panels
were processed at elevated temperature and pressure to cure the resin and form the solid composite
as shown in Figure 12.3. Electromagnetic characterization was performed to extract the effective
material properties through measurements in an anechoic chamber that we developed in the Physics
Department of UCSD. Additional characterizations have been performed on a focused beam
electromagnetic system in the ﬁrst author’s laboratories, CEAM (Center of Excellence for Ad-
vanced Materials), as is discussed in connection with Figure 12.13 later on.
Representative dispersion relations of the dielectric constant in the microwave regime for each
of these panels are given in Figure 12.4, comparing analytical and numerical predictions with the
experimental results. The graphs in this ﬁgure show the characteristic trend of changing the
dielectric constant from negative to positive values as a result of the plasmon media in a composite
panel of each type. Results for the different host materials show similar behavior, though the turn-
on frequency is shifted depending on the dielectric constant of the host material and the wire
diameter and spacing. Moreover, the results show that a host material with a lower dielectric
constant provides a wider bandwidth over which the dielectric constant of the free space can be
matched (Plaisted et al., 2003b).
12.2.1.2 Coiled Wire Plasmon Media Composites
As an alternative to processing thin wires into composites, we may incorporate thicker, more
robust wires in the form of coiled arrays. By proper design of the coil geometry, various degrees
of inductance may be achieved with thicker wires as compared with the thin straight wires. Textile
braiding of reinforcing ﬁbers with wire is an ideal method to integrate the coil geometry into
the composite. The braiding process interlaces two or more yarns to form a uniﬁed structure.
Our process uses a two-dimensional tubular braiding machine, as shown in Figure 12.5, which
operates in a maypole action, whereby half of the yarn carriers rotate in a clockwise direction,
weaving in and out of the remaining counter-rotating carriers. This action results in a two-under
two-over braid pattern. Each yarn makes a helical path around the axis of the braid to create a
uniform coil. To integrate the wire coil into such a structure, we simply replace one of the ﬁber
314

carriers with a wire carrier. A comprehensive description of the textile braiding process is given by
Ko et al. (1989) and Ko (2001). Modeling of the mechanical properties has also been developed for
textile braids (see e.g., Cox et al., 1994; Naik, 1995; Xu et al., 1995; McGlockton et al., 2003; Yang
et al., 2003).
Braiding wire with the reinforcing ﬁbers results in an electromagnetic element with uniform
geometry that maintains its shape under considerable handling and other processing conditions. The

braid itself is a tough structure that protects elements woven into the outer sheath, as well as other
elements in the core. Thus functional elements (wires and/or perhaps sensors) are truly integrated
into the ﬁbers of the host composite, rather than acting as inclusions in the matrix phase.
Furthermore, braiding allows ﬁne control of the pitch and diameter of the wire coil such that the
electromagnetic properties may be tuned for desired performance. The sense of the coil, as left-
handed or right-handed, may also be varied in this process to address issues of chirality, as
discussed below (see Amirkhizi et al., 2003).
12.2.1.2.1
Chirality
The introduction of coil geometry not only affects the inductance of the medium and consequently
the overall dielectric constant, but also introduces different capacitative response than mere straight
wires. This capacitative response usually changes the overall magnetic properties of the medium,
although the inductive response still remains the dominant effect. Part of the magnetic response is
induced by the chirality effect which is discussed presently. However, a more careful and thorough
study is needed since the techniques that can be used to eliminate chirality do not necessarily
change the axial magnetic effects.
Of importance is the effect of the handedness of the coils on the EM ﬁeld vectors. The geometry
of the coils requires that the current density in the conductors has a circumferential component, in
addition to the axial component which is the only component present in the case of the straight
wires. The oscillating circumferential component of the current enhances the magnetic ﬁeld of the
propagating wave with a component parallel to the axis of the coils. Note that as the active
component of the electric ﬁeld is parallel to the axis of the coils, the accompanying magnetic
ﬁeld is normal to it. Therefore the enhanced magnetic ﬁeld is normal to the external excitation.
Moreover the extra component is in phase with the current density and in turn with the external
electric ﬁeld, whereas the external magnetic ﬁeld and electric ﬁeld are out of phase by a quarter of a

carriers that rotate on a circular track. Fibers may be braided around a center mandrel or other ﬁbers in the core of

cycle. If the created magnetic component were in phase with the external excitation, the superposed
ﬁeld would be slightly skewed from the original ﬁeld. This would have meant that one could still
deﬁne principal axes for the material property tensors, although they are slightly angled compared
to the structural axes. However, the phase incompatibility creates rotating magnetic ﬁelds which in
turn create rotating electric ﬁelds. The principal propagating polarizations are not linear any more,
but rather have elliptical polarization (see Figure 12.6).
The effect of chirality can be used to beneﬁt some applications. However, in most cases, it may
introduce unwanted complexity. In order to eliminate this behavior, two methods have been
proposed. The ﬁrst method is to include alternating coils in the array so that every right-handed
coil should be adjacent to a left-handed coil. We considered this solution only for regular arrays as
will be discussed, but we conjecture that since the wavelength is much larger than the spacing
between coils for effective media, a randomly homogenous and statistically equal distribution of the
right and left-handed coils should also have a similar effect. Note that for an irregular medium, the
size of the volume that is randomly homogeneous must be considerably smaller than the wavelength
as compared with a regular array. Another way to eliminate the chirality effect is to use double coils
instead of simple single coils. If two concentric coils with the opposite handedness are together, most
of the magnetic ﬁeld created by the circumferential electric current is effectively canceled.
In the ﬁrst method, one can stack alternating layers of right- and left-handed coils together. The
traveling wave undergoes the opposite effects of the two layers and therefore the polarization of the
ﬁelds will not be rotated. Another arrangement that has the same effect is to design each layer to
have alternating coils. In other words, instead of having alternating layers in the thickness direction,
one has alternating layers in the normal direction. Moreover by shifting these layers by one lattice
spacing, one can achieve a 2-D checker board design. These three designs have similar behavior
and do not signiﬁcantly affect the plasmon frequency, compared to the original chiral medium. The
design with alternating layers normal to the propagation direction is preferable, since the period
length in the propagation direction is smallest and therefore the diffraction frequency limit is
higher, as shown in Figure 12.7.
In the second method, the effect of clockwise or counter-clockwise circumferential current is
not cancelled by adjacent coils, but by a local and concentric coil of the opposite handedness. The
attraction of this method lies in the fact that no special ordering or arrangement at the time of
manufacturing of the composite is required. The double coils can either be made by a two-stage
braiding scheme or a similar design can even be achieved by braiding the conducting coils of
insulated wires at the same time in opposite orientations. The double coils may have an advantage

calculated for a unit cell of a coiled medium using ANSOFT-HFSS. The wave is propagating in the x-direction and
the ﬁelds on the two yz faces have 508 phase difference. The incoming wave (electric ﬁeld) from the far yz face is at
this time polarized parallel to the axis of the coil. However, the effect of the coil adds an out of phase normal
component.Therefore,theﬁeldvectorsofbothelectricandmagneticﬁeldsrotateasthewavetravelsthroughthecell.

in mass production of composites. However, the additional inside loop increases the plasmon
frequency and reduces the effective range of the pass band. Numerical studies show that higher
pitch values can overcome this difﬁculty, as indicated in Figure 12.8. Simulation parameters for
these results are given in Table 12.1.

As an example, we have braided coil elements with para-aramid (DuPont Kevlar1) reinforcing
ﬁber and polyamide (DuPont nylon 6,6) thermoplastic ﬁber. The outer braid consists of a single 30
gauge (0.254 mm diameter) copper wire, four ends of 200 denier Kevlar ﬁber, and three ends of 210

through the medium in the x-direction, each of the above sets can be used to cancel the polarization rotation
effect. To envision the whole array, imagine these as blocks and ﬁll the 3D space with similar blocks in each
case (only translated by the size of the block in each direction). Top left: Each layer through the thickness consists of
alternating coils. The layers are then stacked, such that normal to the thickness, the coils are similar. Top right:
Layers of uniform right-handed and left-handed coils are stacked through the thickness. Bottom left: Checker board
conﬁguration. All four adjacent coils to any single one are of opposite handedness. Bottom right: The effect of the

maintained through the medium. Note that the periodic length of the medium for the top right and bottom left cases
is twice as much as it is for the top left case, hence providing a smaller diffraction frequency limit. The dispersion
relation and plasmon frequency for the principal propagating modes remain essentially unaltered compared to the
uniform arrays. However, the modes are dramatically different.

denier nylon ﬁber. The core of the braid consists of one end of 1000 denier Kevlar ﬁber and three
ends of 420 denier nylon ﬁber. An illustration is provided in Figure 12.9 showing the constituents
of the braid architecture. Nylon is included in the braiding process since it will serve as the polymer
matrix of the ﬁnal composite, although it may not be the optimal choice in terms of mechanical
strength of the resulting composite. Complete ﬁber wet-out can be a difﬁcult processing challenge
in braided composite materials, due to the inherent tight packing of ﬁbers in the braiding process.
We have initially addressed this issue by developing a commingled braid composite, which
integrates the eventual matrix phase as a thermoplastic ﬁber that is braided along with the structural

ﬁbers. Overall, the composite is designed to have a Kevlar ﬁber volume fraction of about 50%.
Selection of the diameter of the core allows control of the diameter of the coil that is braided around
it. The core may be composed of various other elements, including other electromagnetic elements,
or perhaps sensors, though in this initial design we have incorporated only reinforcing ﬁbers. The
pitch of the braids is determined by the take-up and rotation speed of the carriers. The pitch of these
coils was maintained at 608 from the axis of the braid.
The braided elements take the form of a laminate by weaving with other reinforcing ﬁbers to
form a cohesive fabric. The braids may be oriented in a single direction in each layer or may be
woven together bi-directionally. Due to the inherent stiffness of the dry braid, tight weaving
patterns in a bi-directional weave, such as plain weave and satin weave, may be restricted since
the braid cannot be woven over small intervals without kinking, which compromises the braid
structure. This factor is dependent on the braid and wire diameter, where smaller diameters are not
subject to such limitations. This limitation is avoided when braids are woven uni-directionally since
the ﬁll yarns (weft direction) are able to accommodate such undulation while allowing the braid
elements (warp direction) to remain straight. To achieve the desired spacing of the coil array, while
maintaining a uniform composite fabric, blank braids may be woven into the layer or inserted
between layers. The blank braid is identical to the electromagnetic braid element, however, the
copper wire is replaced with an end of reinforcing ﬁber. Additionally, as mentioned above,
chiral effects of the coil geometry can be eliminated by alternate placement of a left-handed
coil next to a right-handed coil. Such an arrangement can be easily achieved in the braiding and
weaving processes. Woven layers are stacked in accord with the electromagnetic design and
processed with additional thermoplastic matrix at elevated temperature and pressure to form the
consolidated composite.
These braided elements have been integrated into a composite panel and characterized
electromagnetically. Figure 12.10
shows such a panel consisting of Kevlar braids woven into
laminates and pressed into a nylon matrix composite. The coils were arranged in an alternating
square matrix in one direction of the composite. Hence, the panel showed a plasmon response in one
orientation and not in the other. The experimental results showed good agreement with our
simulations. The dielectric constant of the structure is measured as a function of frequency

from 11 to 21 GHz, whereupon at around 18 GHz, the dielectric constant passes through zero. This
dispersion relation follows the characteristic trend of the thin straight wire arrays studied previously.
Between the plasma frequency and the upper limit of our frequency sweep, the dielectric constant of
the composite array approaches unity. Since the index of refraction of the material is the square of the
dielectric constant, we may also conclude that the index approaches unity.
12.2.1.4 Controlling the Effective Magnetic Permeability
Following Pendry et al. (1999), Smith et al. (2000a,b), and Shelby et al. (2001), we have shown that
the effective magnetic permeability, m, of free space can be rendered negative over a certain
frequency range by suitably integrating the so called split-ring-resonators, as shown in Figure
12.11. The structure, however, cannot be integrated into a thin composite panel. To remedy this
fundamental barrier, we considered collapsing the rings into nested folded plates, as shown in

a focused beam EM characterization system, Figure 12.13, revealed that indeed the composite
had a negative m over a frequency range of about 8.5 to 9.5 GHz. Following this, a new design was
conceived, numerically simulated, and constructed that had a more pronounced negative m. This
construction is shown in Figure 12.14, and the measured results are given in Figure 12.15. As is
discussed in the next section, combining the negative « and m, it is possible to construct a composite
panel with negative index of refraction.

12.2.1.5 Negative Refractive Index Composites
As mentioned above, over the past several years, the authors at UCSD’s Center of Excellence
for Advanced Materials (CEAM) have developed methods to design, fabricate, and characterize
NIMs, and have demonstrated these capabilities in illustrative microwave experiments. Composite
panels of 2.7 mm thickness have been produced that possess through-the-thickness negative index
that has been measured unambiguously by full S-parameters retrieval, as discussed below (Starr
et al., 2004). Such samples are relatively easy to characterize, as both transmission and reﬂection
measurements can be carried out on very thin samples.
Several views of the actual panel along with the dimensions of the elements within a unit cell of
the CEAM NIM are shown in Figure 12.16–Figure 12.18. The elements that give rise to both
electric and magnetic response are fabricated using multi-circuit board techniques. The composite
is assembled from three laminated layers. The top and bottom layers consist of Rogers 4003 circuit
board laminates (« ¼ 3.38, tan d ¼ 0:003), with a prepreg layer of Gore SpeedBoard (« ¼ 2.56,
tan d ¼ 0.004). The measured (solid) and simulated (dashed) values of the real (black) and
imaginary (gray) index of refraction are shown in Figure 12.19.
The layers are bound together by a layer of adhesive at the interfaces between the Gore and Rogers
circuit boards. Both of the Rogers circuit boards initially have a thin layer of copper (half-ounce or
approximately 1 mm in thickness) deposited on both sides from which the elements are patterned
using conventional optical lithography. The wire elements are patterned on the sides of the Rogers
boards that face the Gore SpeedBoard. This prototype was manufactured by Hughes Circuits.2

Heating Functionality
Initial simulation and testing has been conducted to demonstrate the heating capabilities of our
integrated thin wire arrays (Plaisted et al., 2003a,b; Santos et al., 2004). Using the same wire diameter
and array dimensions as designed for EM functionality, we have applied direct current to resistively
heat a composite sample. Embedded wires are currently used for resistive heating as a method of
welding thermoplastic polymers and polymer composites (Eveno and Gillespie 1988; Jakobsen et al.,
1989; Ageorges et al., 2000) Similarly, embedded heating elements have been used to cure the resin
matrix in thermoset polymer composites (Sancaktar et al., 1993; Ramakrishnan et al., 2000).
12.2.2.1 Simulation and Testing
The thin copper wires in our composite can be connected to a DC electrical source and leveraged as
heating elements, dissipating heat as a result of Ohm’s Law:

where P is power, V is voltage across the circuit element, I is direct current through the circuit, and
R is the resistance of the circuit element. Finite element computer simulation software, NISA, is
used to model the heating in conjunction with experimental testing. The heat transfer module of
NISA, known as NISA/HEAT, uses ﬁnite element methods to solve the heat conduction equation
for temperature based on a set of initial and boundary conditions.
Our thin wire arrayed composites typically have a spacing of 0.125 in. (3.175 mm) between
copper wires of 100 mm diameter. To simulate this geometry in NISA’s graphical interface, a unit
cell of 0.125 in. by 0.125 in. is constructed to represent a cross-section of the composite as shown in
Figure 12.20. To reduce calculations to a 2-D problem, the unit cell is assumed to have unit depth
and a constant cross-section along the length of the wire.

mesh based on: thermal conductivity, mass, density, and speciﬁc heat of the material; electrical
power input and heat generation; and conditions at the edges of the unit cell. We approximate the
thermal properties of the polymer matrix with those of epoxy commonly used in composites. These
properties are prescribed on the polymer elements of the mesh, while the properties of annealed
copper are prescribed on the wire elements. It is assumed that the electrical power input is constant
over time and converted fully into heat, so a constant heat generation is prescribed on the wire
elements. The conditions at the edges of the unit cell are either ‘‘insulated,’’ implying that
boundaries of zero heat ﬂux are prescribed on all edges of the cell, or ‘‘exposed to air,’’ where
convection boundary conditions are prescribed on two opposite edges of the cell instead of zero
heat ﬂux. The insulated condition simulates a unit cell surrounded on all sides by identical material
through periodic boundary conditions.
According to the results of our simulation, the temperature of the insulated unit cell increases
linearly for a constant power input, while the temperature of the exposed unit cell holds constant
after a period of time (Figure 12.21). Also, the temperatures at different locations in the exposed
unit cell vary by as much as 158C, as shown by the multiple lines on the graph. For the insulated unit
cell, the temperature distribution differs by 48C at the most. The power density value (W/cm2) in
these graphs denotes power distribution over the ﬂat area of the composite panel, not the power
distribution over the cross-section.
A sample composite panel was fabricated from glass–ﬁber-reinforced epoxy prepreg and 100-
mm copper wire to test the resistive heating process. Copper wires were strung in a parallel
arrangement in one direction and three thermocouple wires were included at various depths
between the prepreg layers to monitor internal temperatures. The dimensions of the panel were

15 cm by 15 cm by 0.32 cm thick and its ﬁber volume fraction was around 60%. After curing, the
copper wire strands that protruded from the edges of the panel were retained since they provided
electrical connection.
The wires in the composite panel were combined into a single circuit by a custom apparatus we
refer to as a conductor frame. The frame consists of conductor bars to which adhesive copper strips
are attached. By clamping groups of wires to the conductor bars, a combined series–parallel circuit
through the entire panel is created (Figure 12.22). The copper strips extend around the sides of the
upper conductor bar so that they may be connected to the power source. The DC power source used
in these tests was a voltage generator with maximum output of 36 V and 8 A. In addition, the
thermocouple wires were connected to a multi-channel thermocouple monitor. To measure the
electrical power input, two multimeters were included in the setup to measure total voltage across
all wires in the composite and total current across the entire circuit.
The voltage for our initial tests was based on simulation and remained constant throughout each
individual test. The voltage was then iteratively optimized in subsequent tests to achieve our target
temperature. Prior to turning on the power source the initial temperature for all thermocouple
channels was recorded. Once power was supplied to the composite panel, temperatures were
recorded for each of the thermocouple wires at 30-s intervals. The voltage and current were also
recorded every 30 seconds for a total duration of about 20 min.
Noninsulated test conditions were conducted with the panel conﬁguration as shown in Figure
12.22. To test insulated conditions, sheets of cotton-like ﬁberglass were placed on both sides of the
panel to minimize heat loss. The results of the resistive heating tests are qualitatively similar to the
results of the ﬁnite element simulations. The temperature for an insulated composite rises almost
linearly, while the temperature in the exposed composite rises quickly at ﬁrst before holding
constant (Figure 12.23). However, the quantitative results differ noticeably between simulation
and experiment. For insulated conditions, the temperature after 1200 s is above 3008C in simula-
tion, whereas the temperature in the actual test only exceeds 808C. This error is less pronounced for
the exposed case; the simulation predicts a maximum constant temperature of 708C while the test
results have a maximum temperature of 848C. However, the simulation of exposed conditions

predicts a local temperature difference of 158C between different areas in the composite, while this
temperature difference is only about 58C in the actual test.
The tests were carried out for different levels of electrical power, and a linear correlation was
found between the ﬁnal temperature and the power input (Figure 12.24).
Power density over
the face of the panel is used in place of total electrical power so that the value is normalized for
any size of composite panel. Temperature rise is used in place of the actual ﬁnal temperature so that
temperature results are normalized for any initial temperature. According to the graphs, an insulated
panel requires about 60% less power than the exposed panel to reach the same temperature. If an
ambient temperature of 208C is assumed, and our target temperature is 808C, then a temperature
increase of 608C is desired, which corresponds to 0.073 W/cm2 power input for the insulated panel,
compared to the exposed panel’s 0.20 W/cm2.
Thermal management within the composite may be leveraged for a number of applications. In
our multifunctional composite, we may utilize this heating function to induce a thermally activated
healing process as detailed in the next section.
12.2.3
Healing Functionality
A material that can heal itself is of great utility where access for manual repair is limited or
impossible, as in a biological implant or a material that is launched into orbit in the solar system.
Structures made of such a material may have signiﬁcantly prolonged service life in addition to
improved safety if failure mechanisms such as cracking can be repaired in situ. Nature has long
demonstrated this property in various biological materials, whereas, until recently, man-made
healing materials have essentially not been demonstrated. However, interest in synthetic healing
materials has recently gained signiﬁcant attention with the creation of a truly autonomic healing
polymer by White and other researchers at the University of Illinois (White et al., 2001). Since then
other healing materials have been proposed (Bleay et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2002), one of which is a
novel polymer that will be the focus of further research at UCSD. Wudl and his research group at

UCLA have created a strong, tough polymer that forms a high degree of thermally reversible,
covalent cross-links. Mechanical failure of this polymer occurs preferentially along these cross-
links, and due to the reversible nature of this bond it may be repaired by application of moderate
pressure and heat.
12.2.3.1 Polymer Healing
Polymers offer many attributes that allow for healing of damage within the material. Polymers
consist of long chain molecules with molecular weights ranging from 104 to 106. These long chains
are made up of a string of monomers, which are the molecular repeat unit identifying that particular
polymer. Linear, branched, and the other nonnetworked polymers generally form amorphous or
semicrystalline polymers with thermoplastic character. Interaction between chains occurs through
noncovalent bonding such as hydrogen bonding and chain entanglements. As a thermoplastic, the
polymer may be heated to its melting temperature and solidiﬁed repeatedly with little change in the
properties. In contrast, thermosets consist of cross-linked networks formed by covalent bonding and
will degrade, rather than melt, upon heating.
Healing damage within a polymer is most often associated with the softening and ﬂow of
material across a damaged interface that occurs upon heating a thermoplastic polymer. This
technique is commonly known as thermoplastic welding. Healing in thermoplastic polymers occurs
largely due to the restoration of entanglements in the polymer interface. Secondary bonding
between chains, in the form of van der Waals or London dispersion forces, is also critical to the
healing process. Other bonding, such as hydrogen bonding and chemisorption, can play an
important role. Chains are able to diffuse across the interface when heated above the glass transition
temperature, Tg. The rate of crack healing is strongly time dependent, as the once separated
molecular structures diffuse across the interface to form an equivalent bonding state to that of the
virgin material. Crack healing in thermoplastic polymer surfaces seldom results from the reforma-
tion of broken bonds (primary bonds) in the polymer backbone. Typically the polymer chains at the
crack interface have been irreversibly damaged through bond breakage which results in an average
molecular weight signiﬁcantly lower than that of the bulk polymer. Furthermore, the catalyst for
polymerization (through addition or condensation reactions) is not present to repolymerize the
material. The crack healing and welding in thermoplastics has been widely studied in the literature,
particularly by Wool and Kausch and their co-workers (Wool, 1978, 1979, 1995; Jud and Kausch,
1979; Jud et al., 1981; Wool and O’Connor, 1981a,b, 1982; Kausch and Jud, 1982; Kausch, 1983;
Kausch et al., 1987; Kausch and Tirrell, 1989; Wool et al., 1989)
Healing damage within thermoset polymers is typically not possible due to the cross-linked
nature of these materials. The cross-link network prevents the polymer chains from diffusing
through the material when heated above the Tg. Rather the material begins to thermally degrade
when heated excessively, and in contrast to thermoplastics, cannot be returned to its original state.
Until recently, there has been no evidence of repairing damage in highly cross-linked materials. An
interesting repair scheme has been proposed by White et al. to embed a healing system within an
epoxy polymer (White et al., 2001) Liquid monomer is microencapsulated and embedded with
dispersed catalyst in an epoxy polymer, such that a propagating crack intersects a microcapsule and
releases the healing agent to effectively glue the crack shut. A schematic of the healing process
is given in Figure 12.25. Another system, proposed by Wudl and coworkers, uses a novel reversible
bonding approach to repair cross-links (Chen et al., 2002). It is this polymer that has been utilized in
the multifunctional material under development at UCSD.
12.2.3.2 Thermo-Reversibly Cross-Linked Polymer
In 2002, Wudl and coworkers published work on a polymer with the ability to repair internal
cracking (Chen et al., 2002). Until that time, there had been no highly cross-linked polymers that
Multifunctional Materials
329

could be repaired without the use of additional monomers or surface treatment to repair a cracked
interface. Chen et al. accomplished this by synthesizing a polymer based on a thermally reversible
Diels–Alder (DA) and retro-DA cycloaddition. The Diels–Alder cycloaddition is a widely used
reaction in organic synthesis. Many polymers involving the DA cycloaddition have been synthe-
sized, though in many cases the retro-DA reaction is not observed if the diene and dieneophile are
not sufﬁciently stable on their own. Those polymers with suitable monomer combinations to exhibit
the retro-DA reaction have incorporated the DA adduct into the backbone of the polymer (Chujo
et al., 1990; Engle and Wagener, 1993; Imai et al., 2000) In contrast, the unique aspect of the
polymer created by Chen et al. is that all of the monomer linkages, or cross-links, are formed by DA
cycloaddition and furthermore exhibit the retro-DA reaction.
12.2.3.3 Healing Experiments
The weakest bond in the polymer structure is the polymerization or cross-linking bond of the DA
adduct. While strong in comparison to other types of noncovalent chemical bonds, this is the
ﬁrst bond to break when the material is loaded to failure or heated above its transition temperature.
However, because this bond is reversible, this is also the bond that reforms when the material
is cooled below the transition temperature. To test the healing ability of this bond, quantitative
testing of the fracture toughness was performed (Chen et al., 2003). Compact tension samples were
notched with a razor blade and loaded in a direction perpendicular to the pre-crack. To arrest crack
propagation in these tests, a hole was drilled into the middle of the specimen. In this way the cracks
were arrested before fracturing the material into two halves and allowed more accurate alignment of
the fracture surfaces during the healing treatment. Healing was carried out at 1158C for about 30 min
with pressure applied by a clamp. Averaging over three tests, the material was able to recover 81% of
its original fracture load. Furthermore, when the same healing procedure was applied a second time,

the material recovered an average of 78% of the original fracture load, indicating that the material
could be repaired multiple times. It was noted that the crack usually propagated along the same
crack plane.
In addition, we have observed the healing mechanism in samples of this healable polymer. Our
aim was to arrest crack growth prior to complete fracture of the sample. In this way we could improve
the ability to match the severed interfaces back to their original location prior to heating. Due to the
inherent high mechanical strength of this material, a controlled cracking procedure was devised.
Samples were machined to 0.25 in. by 0.15 in. by 0.20 in. dimensions with a 0.08 in. diameter hole
penetrating through the middle. Two notches were cut into the hole to initiate the crack on opposing
sides of the hole. The samples were cooled in liquid nitrogen and immediately loaded in compression
in the direction of the machined notch. The applied load caused cracks to grow from the notches in a
controlled manner in the direction of the applied load. Cracked samples were then placed in a spring
device that applied compression normal to the crack faces so as to put the crack faces in contact. Heat
was then applied at various levels and durations. For samples treated for at least 6 h above 808C
under a nitrogen atmosphere with about 8 kPa of compression normal to the interface, the crack was
observed to disappear, indicating healing. In these cases, no visible scar remained, apart from the
initial starter notch. These tests were only qualitative in nature. However, it appeared that the crack
had been completely repaired and visually the material had been restored to its original state. Figure
12.27 shows representative photographs before and after the healing event.

12.2.3.4 Healing Summary
A cross-linked polymer with thermally reversible covalent bonds, such as that created by Wudl
et al., offers many attractive attributes. When combined with a medium that distributes heat, such
as a network of resistive heating wires, the healing mechanism may be initiated throughout the
material. The effectiveness of such a system has yet to be fully determined, however, since healing
occurs on the molecular level to reestablish broken covalent bond, there is considerable promise.
Initial results on macro-cracked neat polymer samples show excellent potential that near full
recovery of original strength is possible. Moreover, healing may be carried out multiple times on
the same broken bond. This polymer requires outside intervention to initiate the heating (healing)
process. We are developing self-sensing smart materials to embed in this material, where an
integrated self-sensing, self-healing composite may act autonomously.
12.2.4
Sensing Functionality
The goal is to add information-based properties into multifunctional composites, mimicking
nature’s approach to local and global information acquisition, processing, and communication.
Figure 12.28 identiﬁes the necessary three interwoven challenges that must be successfully met in
order to create intelligently sensing composite materials that are:
.
Aware of their environmental and internal changes; and
.
Can selectively acquire, process, and store or communicate information locally and globally.
As is suggested in this ﬁgure, integrating sensing functionality into structural materials begins with
the challenge of composite fabrication that seamlessly integrates within the material the necessary
sensing and electronic platforms, without sacriﬁcing the structural attributes of the resulting system.
The next challenge is that the structurally integrated micro-sensors must be able to monitor, interact
with their neighboring sensors, make on-board decisions, and report on the local structural
environment upon request, or in real-time as necessary. And, the ﬁnal but equally vital challenge
is to create an efﬁcient data handling architecture with local–global processing and communication
algorithms.

12.2.4.1 Integrating Sensing into Composites
Here we focus on the development of a new type of composite with integrated high density of small,
advanced sensors that would enable sensing without compromising the structural integrity. The
volume of work in related areas is vast, and there have been a number of contributions aimed at
incorporating novel nonstructural elements into composite systems (Varadan and Varadan, 2000;
Lin and Fu-Kuo, 2002; Zhou and Sim, 2002). In this section we discuss several of the challenges
associated with sensorized composites, including electronics, mechanical integration, and data
management. We conclude by presenting results of some preliminary work.
12.2.4.2 Sensor Communications and Power
We seek to take advantage of advances in microelectronics, new capabilities in MEMS and sensor
development, data feature extraction algorithms, multi-drop networking protocols, and composite
fabrication technology to enable in situ sensing and damage detection at scalable, and potentially
high areal density. Data bandwidth limitations require local data handling and efﬁcient processing
algorithms. Power management will be necessary to make high sensor densities possible. Embed-
ded sensors require both power and a means of communication. Ideally, this would be done with the
fewest number of conductors possible, and use a multi-drop network if feasible. The 1-Wire1
network allows for distribution of power and two-way communications among many devices over a
single pair of conductors.3
The 1-Wire network is speciﬁed for operation over a supply voltage range of 2.8 to 6 VDC. The
positive, or data, line is held high by a nominal 5 kV impedance source. Multiple devices may be
attached to the same network wire pair. Each device has a unique 64-bit address. The network
protocol uses half duplex communications in master–slave architecture, where devices respond
only upon command from the master. The protocol uses serial bit communications at 16.3 kbps. An
overdrive mode is available that increases the data rate to 142 kbps. The network protocol not only
allows individual device addressing, but also enables a novel search algorithm that allows a
network master to discover all unique 64-bit addresses on any particular network. Power is
drawn by the network device from the data line while it is high, and stored onboard the device in
a nominal 800 pF capacitor for use during the intervals when the line is low.
The presence of multiple devices on a single network can increase the capacitive load on the
network. Reﬂections at longer network distances and higher capacitance per unit length conductor
pairs can cause slew rate problems, and contribute to limitations in the total fanout, or number
devices that can be accommodated on a single network. Active pull-up drivers, careful attention to
line termination, and proper transmission line design can compensate some of these effects. A well-
designed system might accommodate several hundred devices, and has been demonstrated in a
laboratory setting (Dallas, 2004).
12.2.4.3 Mechanical Integration
Previous efforts to integrate sensors and MEMS devices into ﬁber-reinforced composites have often
required that such a device be placed between the ﬁber layers of a composite as it is being
fabricated. As a result, the device is usually surrounded by the matrix phase, typically a polymer,
which is generally the weak phase within the composite. Interlaminar regions are often the source
of failure within a composite due to delamination, since often there is no reinforcement in the
thickness direction (this problem may be minimized by through-the-thickness stitching). Depend-
ing on the size of an embedded device, this region is further weakened by the presence of sensors
which can serve as stress concentrators. These sensors act as discontinuities in transferring stress
within the material, leading to matrix cracking, debonding, delamination, and ultimately mechan-
ical failure. Fiber optic sensors do not present a similar problem, since the sensor itself is a ﬁber that
Multifunctional Materials
333

commingles with the other reinforcing ﬁbers of the material. However, ﬁber optic sensors do not
offer the diverse sensing potential of MEMS and other microsensors. More importantly, they do not
present a networking option within the structure itself, which is an essential ingredient of a truly
sensing composite, as will be discussed in greater detail below.
To address the issues associated with structural integrity, we envisage a multicomponent braid,
which consists of ﬁbers for mechanical reinforcement, metallic (e.g., copper) wires for power and
communications, and polymer matrix material impregnated around periodically spaced sensor or
electronics packages, that can be integrated into the composite as a single ﬁbrous braided element
(see Figure 12.29). The multicomponent braid also acts to isolate the sensor or electronics elements
within a protective environment that is commensurate with the composite structure as a whole.
Rather than acting as an inclusion, the sensor network is integrated directly into the ﬁber phase of the
composite. Braiding these sensors into and along with reinforcing ﬁbers forms a protective casing
around the discontinuity that mitigates the ﬂaws and related failure modes of embedded designs.
The resulting sensor braid is suitable for inclusion in the composite panel in one of two ways.
First, it may be directly laid into the composite layup, forming an integral vein within the composite
structure, the woven ﬁber sheets forming the basis of the material in the usual manner of laminated
composites. The spacing of these sensor braids can be such that they are isolated from each other
while providing the desired degree of sensing within the material. Alternatively, the braided
elements may be used in creating a woven fabric that commingles the braids with further reinfor-
cing ﬁbers, similar to the woven fabric used in traditional laminated composites. Depending upon
the desired sensor density, the electronic sublattice braid can be included at appropriate spacing in
one or multiple directions as needed.
A critical issue to be addressed in forming a multicomponent braid with sensing elements is the
behavior of the sensor interconnects during normal composite processing. Both the high tempera-
ture and pressures can contribute to loss of interconnects during the processing; also, if not properly
managed, stresses can build during the thermal equilibration that can result in both interconnect
failure and incipient failure sites.
Three-dimensional braiding has been employed in the past as a method to integrate ﬁber
optic sensors into 3-D woven preforms of composites (El-Sherif and Ko, 1993). Our method,
however, uses two-dimensional tubular braiding to create continuous ﬁbrous braids that protect
the sensor and wiring within the core of the braid. In our tubular braiding process, carriers containing
spools of reinforcing ﬁber weave in and out of each other in a radial pattern to form a protective
sheath around the sensor and wiring that feeds from a central carrier. As mentioned previously, these
Figure 12.29 (See color insert following page 302)
Illustration of a sensor embedded in a composite braid.
334
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

braids may be woven with further reinforcing ﬁbers to form composite fabric, or they may be placed
between the layers of a laminate composite. Conventional resin transfer molding techniques such as
VARTM may then be used to wet the composite ﬁbers with thermoset polymer. Care must be taken
in this step to avoid damage to the sensors due to excess pressure and in some cases temperature, if
curing and/or postcuring of the polymer matrix at elevated temperature were necessary.
12.2.4.4 Data Management
As the number of sensor nodes increases, and as the data load at each sensor increases, data
management becomes a key issue. If data were processed and analyzed external to the embedded
network, the bandwidth needed to transport the data would grow to unrealizable levels for any
reasonably sized structure. The computational requirements whether in- or ex-network become
intractable as well. The size of the envisaged network of embedded sensors, even for a moderately,
sized structure, will likely generate immense quantities of data that must be coordinated, inter-
preted, and acted upon. While optimal data fusion algorithms have been developed for small,
typically unconstrained, networks of sensors (Waltz and Llinas, 1990; Goodman et al., 1997;
Varshney, 1997), less is known about data fusion in networks of large numbers of sensors.
Localized processing algorithms provide a solution for the management of large data sets, and
are appropriate for sensorized composites. In local processing algorithms, some primitive process-
ing capability must be introduced to each sensor node, such that decision making in part becomes
controlled by the local elements. The local processing scheme is entirely compatible with the low
power, low bandwidth networks that can be scalably embedded in materials. Processing schemes
from communication theory (Middleton, 1960; Gabrielle, 1966), speciﬁcally the FFT and decoding
large block length codes, suggest that efﬁcient and near optimal solutions can be achieved with
local, hierarchical algorithms. The alternative to local processing, for example, extracting all data
and performing external processing, is a computationally infeasible procedure (NP-complete);
large-sized data sets cannot be used optimally (Tsitsiklis and Athans, 1985).
Any proposed method of data handling or processing will not be speciﬁcally applicable to all
applications. The nature of the data or problem will generally dictate the type of solution needed.
12.2.4.5 Preliminary Results
We have undertaken some preliminary work to verify the feasibility of embedding sensors in
composites. An early issue is whether the proposed sensors, as well as interconnects, can survive
composite processing. As an initial test case, we embed sensors into a layup of thermally cured
prepreg composite.
The DS18B20X 1-Wire digital thermometer was chosen as a demonstration sensor.4 The
DS18B20X has a 1.32 by 1.93 mm footprint, and is 0.6 mm high. A microprocessor was programmed
to communicate over the micro-network. A planar substrate was chosen for the initial demonstration.
The substrate was a conventional ﬁberglass-based printed circuit board material (FR4), 0.010 in.
thick, 0.080 in. wide and 6 in. long with a 1
2 oz. Cu foil overlayer. Strips with the device land pattern
shown in Figure 12.30 were fabricated using a rapid PCB prototyping numerical controlled milling
machine.5 While 1-Wire devices can operate in a two conductor ‘‘parasitic’’ mode, a more robust
three-wire conﬁguration was selected to allow the power and communications to have separate lines,
sharing a common ground. Convection hot gas solder reﬂow was used to connect to the substrate.
Following preliminary electronic testing of the device, it was embedded in a glass ﬁber-
reinforced epoxy composite. Style 7781 E-glass fabric was preimpregnated with BT-250 epoxy
resin supplied by Bryte Technologies, Inc. The substrate with attached sensor was embedded in the
middle of eight layers of prepregged material. The layup was consolidated at 2508F for 1 h under
50 psi pressure according to the material processing speciﬁcations. The connecting wires were
passed through a silicone sealing tape that protected them from excess resin during the curing

process. The sensor as embedded was demonstrated to work successfully. The 1-Wire protocol was
implemented in an SX48-based microcontroller that serves as the 1-Wire master. The total network
length (master to device) was about 20 cm for this proof-of-principle work.
Any sensor with a temperature-dependent output may require control or calibration of
thermal effects. Repetitive reads of the DS18B20X were observed to cause a temperature increase

cients of the particular sample determine the dynamic and ultimate steady-state temperature increase.
A 10 by 10 array of the same sensors was also fabricated on similar FR4 circuit board material.
After veriﬁcation of the operation of the 10 by 10 array it was embedded in an aramid ﬁber (Kevlar)
reinforced composite panel. The panel is 15 cm by 15 cm square, and is about 2.5 mm thick. It was
formed from 16 layers of aramid fabric under vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding. A two-part
epoxy resin was pulled through the fabric by the vacuum action to provide complete wetting of the
ﬁbers. In this case, the fabric was draped over the sensors and substrate. This panel is shown in
Figure 12.32.

Continued research is necessary to successfully develop a sensor integration technology within a
braided ﬁber component of a composite. It will be necessary to measure the mechanical properties

of the embedded sensor composite in a variety of mechanical loading scenarios to determine and
limit any adverse impacts on the strength of the composite. Additionally, detailed electrical design
of the embedded network will need to be undertaken. If higher sensor densities are to be contem-
plated, the network architecture and data handling strategies will also need careful study.
The current work is focused on the implementation of a composite embedded network. As those
problems are solved, it will be necessary to turn to speciﬁc structurally signiﬁcant sensors to ﬁnally
realize integrated structural health monitoring of composites. We expect continued progress in
electronic miniaturization and power management. Smaller IC linewidths will drive the overall size
of chip scale packages smaller. Current work in implementing 458 on chip interconnects also promise
to reduce Si real estate demands. Higher levels of integration of MEMS-based sensors with standard IC
processing will result in greater choices of microsensors to integrate into composite structures.

SUMMARY
The ﬁeld of multifunctional materials is still in its infancy with regard to various functionalities that
may be integrated into structural materials. With Nature as our guide the possibilities are limitless.
We have presented an overview of a multifunctional composite material being developed at UCSD.
This material incorporates electromagnetic, thermal management, healing and sensing functional-
ities into a structural composite. Integrated copper conductors resonate to provide a tuned dielectric
constant and index of refraction, ranging from negative through positive values. These conductors
may also serve as resistive heating elements to provide thermal management, which may be further
utilized to activate a thermal repair mechanism in a healable polymer matrix. Integrated network
sensors provide in situ sensing and damage detection at scalable and potentially high areal density
with local processing and decision making. Future work will include the fabrication of smaller scale
conductive element designs to achieve EM functionality in the terahertz frequency regime. The
architecture of the braided elements is being tailored to obtain optimal mechanical properties of the
composite structure. We are now studying other sensing technologies, such as piezoelectrics and
MEMS devices, which will interact through a network similar to that which we have demonstrated
with our thermal sensors.

INTRODUCTION
Whilst there are several proposed uses of biomimetics in defense or attack (martial, general law
enforcement) systems, at present they seem to be mostly development of novel materials (occa-
sionally novel mechanisms) in an established context. Examples are armor, personal or otherwise,
made of analogs of silk, mother-of-pearl (nacre), or wood. I do not intend to rehearse this topic
further. Camouﬂage is another area that has been examined, especially adaptive camouﬂage, but
since there is still much to be learned about camouﬂage techniques in nature (which I take to
include mimicry — camouﬂage is ‘deception’), I have included it. In general, camouﬂage and
armor are inimical; the tendency is for the more primitive ( ¼ evolutionarily older) animals of any
particular phylum to be well armored but slow and relatively easily seen, whereas the more highly
evolved ones are less well armored, or have no armor at all, but are fast-moving, or very well
camouﬂaged, or both. Thus they rely on speed and behavioral adaptiveness and subtlety for their
safety. The inevitable conclusion is that nature often employs guerrilla techniques rather than what
we think of as ‘‘conventional’’ ones. This may be related to the perceived ﬁnancial investment. In
human warfare, an infantryman is seen as more expendable than the combination of a pilot and
aircraft. Indeed a signiﬁcant reason for having a pilot is as a hostage to the aircraft’s expensive
technology, so that it is brought back in one piece from a sortie.
The preparation of a chapter like this is especially difﬁcult since I could not think of a suitable
narrative to cover all the possibilities that exist in nature. Also, I have little understanding of the
techniques that are available to, or desired by, the military and police (the obvious users of defense
mechanisms). I decided, therefore, to adopt a classiﬁcatory approach, and to use an existing military
classiﬁcation as my template (Alexander et al., 1996). I have removed the obviously nonbiological
techniques that involve explosives, lasers, etc., have retained others which, although biology does
not present us with the same resource, are obvious functional analogs, and have included some that
seemed to be missing from Alexander’s list but are present in biology. These latter are presented
without citations.
Man has many martial devices that have their reﬂections in nature, but the similarities have
either not been recognized or have not been developed. And since the outcome in nature is, mostly
for all parties, in an intraspeciﬁc encounter to live to ﬁght another day (or at least live), perhaps we
have still much to learn. As for the rest, I suspect we have an untapped resource for biomimicry;
I have mostly left the extrapolation from biology to technology to the reader, otherwise this chapter
would have been too long. But most of the examples quoted either have a technological counterpart
or could be realized without much difﬁculty.
The Department of Defense deﬁnes (non-lethal) weapons as designed and deployed so as to
incapacitate people or their weapons and other equipment, rather than destroying them; also to

have minimal effects on the environment. Unlike conventional, lethal, weapons that destroy their
targets principally through blast, penetration and fragmentation, non-lethal weapons have rela-
tively reversible effects and affect objects differently (Alexander et al., 1996).
13.2
ACOUSTICS
13.2.1
Blast Wave Projector
Energy generation from a pulsed laser that will project a hot, high pressure plasma in the air in
front of a target. It creates a blast wave with variable but controlled effects on hardware and troops
(Alexander et al., 1996).
This could be akin to cavitation bubbles that are the loudest source of sound from ship
propellers.
Snapping shrimps (Stomatopods or mantis shrimp) are very noisy; it has been long assumed that
the noise was caused by their claws closing. In Odontodactylus scyllarus, the sound is caused by the
collapse of cavitation bubbles due to the high speed at which the claw moves, powered by a highly
elastic part of the exoskeleton. The shrimps appear to use cavitation to stun their prey (small crabs,
ﬁsh, and worms); it certainly wreaks havoc with the shrimp’s own exoskeleton. Although the claw
is highly mineralized, its surface becomes pitted and damaged; stomatopods moult frequently and
produce a new smashing surface every few months (Patek et al., 2004).
13.2.2
Infrasound
Very low-frequency sound that can travel long distances and easily penetrate most buildings and
vehicles. Transmission of long wavelength sound creates biophysical effects; nausea, loss of
bowels, disorientation, vomiting, potential internal organ damage or death may occur. Superior
to ultrasound because it is ‘‘in band’’ meaning that its does not lose its properties when it changes
mediums such as from air to tissue. By 1972 an infrasound generator had been built in France that
generated waves at 7 Hz. When activated it made the people in range sick for hours (Alexander
et al., 1996).
Whales are certainly able to generate low frequencies (15 to 30 Hz) which they use for
communication over long distances (the capercaillie, a ground-living bird of the Scottish wood-
lands, uses low frequencies for the same reason) but they have not been tested for any damaging
effects (Croll et al., 2002).
Although it does not really belong to ‘‘infrasound,’’ animals (e.g., frogs, birds, and deer)
advertize a false impression of exaggerated size by making low frequency sounds (Reby and
McComb, 2003). The implication for other animals is that a low noise can only come from a
large resonant cavity, so the animal producing the noise is probably large and therefore probably
strong. Producing low frequency vibrations is therefore a premium especially if the animal cannot
be seen and the assessment of size can be made only from the frequency range of the noise.
13.2.3
Squawk Box
Crowd dispersal weapon ﬁeld tested by the British Army in Ireland in 1973. This directional device
emits two ultrasonic frequencies which when mixed in the human ear become intolerable. It
produces giddiness, nausea or fainting. The beam is so small that it can be directed at speciﬁc
individuals (Alexander et al., 1996).
There are many reports of dolphins using a similar technique, either when hunting or when
swearing at a human experimenter. In a U.K. radio programme some years ago, a researcher
recounted playing back its own sounds to a dolphin to see what it would do, including listening
Defense and Attack Strategies and Mechanisms in Biology
343

to the dolphin’s response with a hydrophone. The dolphin was quite amenable to this game and
cooperated well. But by mistake the experimenter sent the dolphin a rather loud signal to which
the dolphin obviously objected. The dolphin looked at the experimenter through the walls of the
aquarium, then went to the hydrophone and blasted into it before the experimenter could rip off his
earphones. The experimenter experienced much pain! The implication is that we could probably
learn about physiologically damaging noise from dolphins and other cetaceans that are also much
more experienced with the technique, having been using it for longer than we have.

ANTILETHAL DEVICES
13.3.1
Body Armor
Many animals have a hard outer covering that serves as armor, but there are many different ways in
which the function is realized. Whereas the armor developed for individuals or vehicles is based on
the inevitability of attack, and relies on resisting by strength, biological armor can come in many
guises. Obvious ones are armadillo and tortoise, although nobody seems to have made any
measurements of the protection that is given. The same is not true of ankylosaurs (Figure 13.1)
and their relatives, herbivorous dinosaurs that grew to 10 m long during the late Jurassic and
Cretaceous. They had centimeter-sized osteodermal plates that covered back, neck, head, and also
protected the eyes. In polarized light, sections of the plates show where collagen — a normal
precursor of bone and an essential component of skin — was incorporated. Comparing similar
dermal bones from stegosaurus and crocodile, the polocanthids had extra collagen ﬁbres that may
have stabilized the edges of the bony plates. But in nodosaurids — which also had plates between 2
and 5 cm thick, the collagen ﬁbres ran parallel and perpendicular to the surface, and then at 458 to
each of these axes, providing reinforcement in all directions. Ankylosaurids had thinner plates that
were 0.5 to 1.0 cm thick, convex shaped, which will have increased their stiffness in bending, and
with the collagen ﬁbres randomly arranged.
The dinosaur structure seems to be repeated in the bone-free collagenous skin of the white
rhinoceros, which is three times thicker and contains a dense and highly ordered three-dimensional
array of relatively straight and highly crosslinked collagen ﬁbres. The skin of the back and sides
of the animal is therefore relatively stiff (240 MPa) and strong (30 MPa), with high breaking
energy (3 MJ m3) and work of fracture (78 kJ m2). These properties fall between those of tendon
and skin as would be expected from a material with a large amount of collagen (Shadwick
et al., 1992).

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

Unfortunately the data on ‘‘soft’’ body armor (e.g., Kevlar) does not quote performance in these
units, preferring to equate energy of an incoming threat to depth of penetration through the armor.
Presumably one has to go to reports from the old big game hunters to get similar information about
the rhinoceros. However, leather is still tougher than Kevlar, although nobody really understands
why, since the collagen ﬁbres are not dissimilar from Kevlar in general morphology.
A concept that is entirely alien to the current design of man-made armor is the porcupine quill,
although the pikestaff of the medieval infantryman might be considered analogous, and parts of
mediaeval armor and their weapons were equipped with spikes to keep the enemy at bay. The
porcupine has several different types of quill; those with a length-to-diameter ratio greater than
about 25 are mostly rattles to warn enemies that there are quills here. Those with a lower length-
to-diameter ratio (15 or less) act as columns when they meet an end load, and with the sharp tip, can
easily penetrate ﬂesh. They are sometimes brittle and the tip can break off, but they also have weak
roots in the porcupine’s skin and so can easily be pulled out when the impaled attacker moves away.
The quills are ﬁlled with a variety of reinforcing foams, struts, and stringers, so that they rarely
break when buckled (Vincent and Owers, 1986). Quills are modiﬁed hairs and are made of keratin.
In general, plants have totally passive defense mechanisms, which is energetically probably
much cheaper. They are thus built to survive a certain amount of damage due to grazing, and may
even grow more vigorously in response. Many plants, especially those living under dry conditions,
such as the acacia, have spines, thorns, or hooks that cause pain to the animals attacking them.
Presumably the giraffe, which feeds on such plants, has a reinforced surface to its tongue so that it
can cope with the abuse. Many of the grain-bearing plants (Graminae) have silica particles —
sometimes as much as 15% of the dry weight — which wears down the teeth of the animals feeding
on them. Indeed the performance of the teeth is frequently dependent on such wear, exposing a
complex of self-sharpening cutting and grinding surfaces (Alexander, 1983). The literature on
plant–animal interactions is large, mostly concerned with how plants control the ease with which
they can be grazed, commonly by limiting crack propagation with inhomogeneities such as
embedded ﬁbres; and their chemical defenses which range from repulsive taste or smell, through
manipulation of the digestion or behavior of the grazer (by psychoactive drugs) to lethal chemicals,
mostly in those plants which cannot afford to be eaten since they grow so slowly.
In both plants and animals, spines and thorns are passive and are of use only at close quarters.
The closest equivalent is barbed wire which many claim to be biomimetic.
Horns and antlers can be used for both attack and defense, an unusual concept for technology —
the closest analogy is the sword, which can be used both to deliver a blow and to parry one. The
utility of antlers (dead, made of bone, replaced each season, grown from the tip) and horns (living,
made of a thick keratin sheath over a bone core, incremented each season, grown from the base) has
been questioned by animal behaviorists who ﬁnd difﬁculty coping with the wide range in sizes of
horns and antlers, and the range in forces imposed on them during ﬁghting. These problems were
largely resolved by Kitchener, who showed that there is a linear relationship between the second
moment of area at the base of the horn or antler and the body weight of the animal, and that this
relationship is constant for any single style of ﬁghting. Most styles are ritualistic and akin to
wrestling; sheep and goats are far more agonistic, throwing themselves at each other resulting in
more random forces being exerted on their horns (Kitchener, 1991).
Ever since their discovery in the 16th century, the enormous antlers of the extinct Irish elk or
giant deer (Megaloceros giganteus) have attracted scientiﬁc attention. Mechanical analysis of the
antlers of the Irish elk shows that they are massively over-designed for display (for which, as John
Currey pointed out, they really only need to be made of waterproof cardboard) because the force
exerted by gravity acting on the antlers is less than 1% of their strength. In contrast, the antlers seem
to be optimally designed for taking the maximum estimated forces of ﬁghting, that are more than
50% of the strength of the antler, as would be expected for a biological structure of this kind.
However, this analysis assumes that the mechanical properties of the bone of the Irish elk antlers
and living deer are similar. It would be unwise to measure directly the mechanical properties of
Defense and Attack Strategies and Mechanisms in Biology
345

Irish elk antler after more than 10,000 years in a peat bog. Instead, neutron diffraction, which
measures the degree of preferred orientation of the hydroxyapatite crystals that comprise bone,
showed that the orientation of the hydroxapatite is predictable from the presumed forces generated
during ﬁghting. Thus on the tensile faces of the antler, the orientation was along the length of the
antler, whereas on the compressive faces, the orientation was more orthogonal to the long axis —
exactly what the theory of ﬁbrous composite materials predicts (Kitchener et al., 1994).
13.3.2
Passive Camouﬂage
Many American hunters recommend that more effort should be put into the research on camou-
ﬂage, and that body armour should be a second priority to ﬁnding effective concealment. The logic
is that what you can’t see, you can’t hit. Body armour is required only when you can be seen and
identiﬁed.
Many animals and plants, especially insects, can look like inert objects such as bits of wood
or stones (e.g., the succulent South American plant Lithops). Because of their colored wings,
many moths can conceal themselves when placed against a suitable background such as the bark
of a tree. The peppered moth (Biston betularia) in industrial areas of England has been held
as a classic example of natural selection, with birds eating those moths that they could see
only when they were sitting on an unsuitably colored bark. In this instance the moth was
originally light with small black speckling, but pollution produced in the early industrial revolution
blackened the trees, so an initially rare dark form of the moth was selected by being less easily seen
and eaten (Kettlewell, 1955). Later, with reduced pollution and clearing of the woods, the bark was
lighter and better lit and the lighter-colored form again predominated. Similarly many nesting birds
are difﬁcult to see; ground-nesting birds have camouﬂaged eggs and chicks. Many insects,
especially grasshoppers, have bright hind wings which disappear when the insect stops ﬂying,
settles, and folds its wings thus becoming camouﬂaged. This sudden change makes it difﬁcult to
spot the insect.
Another basic component of passive camouﬂage, well known to technology, is countershading,
in which, those parts of the body that are normally well illuminated are darkly colored, and those
that are normally shaded lightly colored . This is seen in both terrestrial and aquatic animals; the
corollary is the larva of the privet hawk moth (Sphinx ligustri) which is dark on the underside and
light on the upperside, and habitually hangs inverted beneath its twig. The effect is to ﬂatten the
aspect of the animal, making it difﬁcult to judge its size and how far away it is.
The literature of camouﬂage in biology is very large (Wickler, 1968).
13.3.3
Warning Coloration
The announcement that you are strong or dangerous is useful since it can deter an enemy from
attacking, and gains its best effect by the strong making themselves easily seen. But one can also
pretend strength. This is not novel, and has been used for hundreds of years with armies making
themselves appear larger than they are with hats on sticks, unattended guns protruding through the
battlements, and soldiers circulating past a small gap for the enemy to see . . .
Many animals and plants (especially fruits) advertize that they are poisonous or that they have
a very nasty sting or bite. Typical warning colors are bright, for instance red and yellow associated
with black, mutually arranged to maximize contrast and visibility (aposematic coloration). There is
a vast amount of literature on this aspect of coloration, which includes mimicking of an unpalatable
animal by a palatable one (Batesian mimicry) and mimicry of palatable mimics of unpalatable
animals (Mu¨llerian mimicry). Such mimicry is probably commonest amongst butterﬂies, where the
main selection agent is predatory birds and the habitat is thick forest or woodland (Wickler, 1968).
Thus, the predatory bird probably only ever gets a ﬂeeting glimpse, poorly illuminated of its
prospective prey, and with this minimal information it has to decide whether or not to attack. It
346
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

is imaginable that under these conditions even a slight resemblance to an unpleasant species is
enough to convince a bird not to attack.
Most insects, in particular beetles, butterﬂies, and moths, get their noxious chemicals from the
plants they feed on. The ﬁrst bird to be discovered with warning coloration and toxic feathers is the
Pitohui of New Guinea (Dumbacher et al., 2004). The source of the alkaloids, also found in poison-
dart frogs, is Melyrid beetles.
13.3.4
Active Camouﬂage
Created by dynamically matching the object to be camouﬂaged to its background colors and light
levels thus rendering it virtually invisible to the eye. This is conceptually the same camouﬂage
process as that used by a chameleon. This is accomplished through a sophisticated color and light
sensor array that detects an object’s background color and brightness. This data is then computer
matched and reproduced on a pixel array covering the viewing service of the object to be
camouﬂaged.
Pattern control is achieved by ﬂatﬁsh such as the plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) that can change
its shading and patterns to suit a variety of backgrounds — including a chequer board! However, it
can manage only black and white, and then only slowly, over a matter of minutes, since its color-
change cells (melanophores) are hormonally controlled. They change color by moving pigment
around inside the cell going from ‘‘concentrated’’ (the pigment is centered making the cell white or
translucent) to ‘‘dispersed’’ (the pigment is spread around the cell which now appears dark) (Fuji,
2000; Ramachandran et al., 1996).
Color control in octopus and squid (cephalopod — literally ‘‘head-footed’’ — molluscs) is
managed by colored cells — chromatophores — that are found in the outer layers of the skin. Each
comprises an elastic sac containing pigment to which is attached radial muscles. When the muscles
contract, the chromatophore is expanded and the color is displayed; when they relax, the elastic sac
retracts. The chromatophore muscles are controlled by the nervous system. Differently colored
(red, orange, and yellow) chromatophores are arranged precisely with respect to each other, and to
reﬂecting cells (iridophores producing structural greens, cyans and blues, and leucophores, reﬂect
incident light of whatever wavelength over the entire spectrum) beneath them. Neural control of the
chromatophores enables a cephalopod to change its appearance almost instantaneously (Hanlon
et al., 1999), a key feature in some escape behaviors and during ﬁghting signalling. Amazingly the
entire system apparently operates without feedback from sight or touch (Messenger, 2001).
The primary function of the chromatophores is to match the brightness of the background and
to help the animal resemble the substrate or break up the outline of the body. Because the chroma-
tophores are neurally controlled, the animal can, at any moment, select and exhibit one particular
body pattern out of many, which presumably makes it difﬁcult for the predator to decide or
recognize what it is looking at. When this is associated with changes in shape or behavior, the
prey can become totally confusing. Consider this performance by an octopus found in Indo-
Malaysian waters. It is seen on the seabed as a ﬂatﬁsh and swims away with characteristic
‘‘vertical’’ (remember the ﬂatﬁsh swims on its side) undulations. As it does so it changes into a
poisonous zebra ﬁsh. It then dives into a hole and sends out two arms in opposite directions to
mimic the front and back ends of a poisonous banded sea snake (videos of these behavior patterns
are available to download with the paper by Norman et al.). It also sits on the sea bed with its arms
raised, possibly in imitation of a large poisonous sea anemone. Or it can sink slowly through the
water column apparently imitating a jellyﬁsh (Norman et al., 2001). Each of these types of animal
requires a different response on the part of the predator, which presumably is totally confused. Such
dynamic mimicry is seen only in cephalopods and the ﬁlms of the Marx Brothers.
Countershading in animals is widespread and cephalopods are no exception. On the ventral
surface, the chromatophores are generally sparse, sometimes with iridophores to enhance reﬂec-
tion; dorsally the chromatophores are much more numerous and tend to be maintained tonically
Defense and Attack Strategies and Mechanisms in Biology
347

expanded. More remarkably, however, cephalopods can maintain countershading when they
become disorientated. The countershading reﬂex ensures that chromatophores on the ventral
surface of the entire body expand when the animal rolls over on its back: a half-roll elicits
expansion of the chromatophores only on the upper half of the ventral body. Such a response is,
of course, possible only in an animal whose chromatophores are neurally controlled (Ferguson et al.,
1994). When matching brightness, the chromatophores act like a half-tone screen; color matching is
achieved with the chromatophores, iridophores, and leucophores (Hanlon and Messenger, 1988).
On variegated backgrounds, a cuttleﬁsh will adopt the disruptive body pattern, whose effect is
to break up the ‘‘wholeness’’ of the animal (Figure 13.2). Disruptive coloration is a concealment
technique widespread among animals. Octopus vulgaris has conspicuous frontal white spots;
loliginid squids show transverse dark bands around the mantle that probably render the animal
less conspicuous, and the harlequin octopuses have bold black-and-white stripes and spots.
Although many animals use patterning for concealment, it is nearly always a ﬁxed pattern.
Because they control their chromatophores with nerves and muscles, cephalopods can select one of
several body patterns to use on a particular background.
Cephalopods also produce threatening or frightening displays. In its extreme form, the animal
spreads and ﬂattens, becoming pale in the middle and dark around the edges, creating dark rings
around the eyes and dilating the pupil, and in sepioids and squids, creating large dark eyespots on
the mantle. This effect is extremely startling. The animal also seems to get bigger.
13.3.5
Translucent Camouﬂage
The best way to avoid being seen is to be invisible and so cast no shadow. The equivalent of
translucence is to present the observer with the scene which the object is blocking out. In a
technical world this can be done using a camera to ﬁlm the scene that is blocked and presenting
it to the observer in front of the object.
Whole animals (e.g. pelagic marine organisms such as jelly ﬁsh, sea gooseberries, and many
larval forms) or parts of animals (e.g. the cornea of the eye) can be translucent and therefore nearly
invisible. To be translucent, reﬂection of incident light must be kept to a minimum and light must
be neither scattered nor absorbed as it passes through the body. Scattering is caused by variations
in refractive index. Animal tissue normally has many variations in refractive index (cells, ﬁbres,
nuclei, nerves, and so on). The most important factors are the distribution and size of the
components; refractive index is less important; the shape of the components is least important.
For instance, if a cell requires a certain volume of fat to survive but must scatter as little light as
Figure 13.2 (See color insert following page 302)
A cuttleﬁsh (Sepia ofﬁcinalis) can change its appearance
accordingto the background. Here the animal changes its body patternwhen movedfrom a sandyor gravel substrate
to one with shells. (Courtesy of Roger T. Hanlon, Senior Scientist, Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA.)
348
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

possible, it is best to divide the fat into many very small droplets. Slightly worse is to divide it into a
few large droplets, but the very worst is to divide it into drops about the size of the wavelength of
light (Johnsen, 2001).
Variations in refractive index do not always cause scattering. If the refractive indices vary by
less than half the wavelength of light, the scattered light is eliminated by destructive interference
and the light waves overlap in such a way that they cancel each another. This happens in the cornea
of the eye, which is constructed of an orthogonal array of collagen ﬁbres.
Many organisms living in the deeper ocean, where there is little or no ambient light to be
reﬂected or by which camouﬂage color can be seen, produce their own light. The organs that do this
— photophores — can be mounted on mechanisms which rotate them so that they face the body and
are effectively obscured, hence can be modulated and switched on and off (Johnsen et al., 2004).
13.3.6
Reﬂecting Camouﬂage
If an object can simply reﬂect the color and pattern of its surroundings, then it will be adaptive. But
if it merely reﬂects the sky when looked at from above, or the ground when looked at from below,
this will be ineffective. The geometry of the reﬂecting surface is crucial. In deep water, the laterally
scattered light is equal in intensity from a range of angles. Looking up, one sees brightness; looking
down there is dim blue-green. A perfect mirror suspended vertically in the water would be invisible
since the light from the surface is reﬂected to a viewer below, making the mirror appear translucent.
Many ﬁsh have platelets of guanine in their scales arranged vertically, thus generating such a mirror
independently of the shape of the section of the body. The ﬁsh is also countershaded. Viewed
laterally the ﬁsh is a reﬂector and therefore invisible. Viewed from the top, it is dark like the depths
below it. Viewed from below it is silvery white like the surface.
The most difﬁcult view to camouﬂage is that from directly below when the ﬁsh obscures light
from above. Many clupeids, such as the threadﬁn shag Dorosoma petense, are thin and come to a
sharp edge at the belly. This allows light from above to be reﬂected vertically downwards over the
entire outline (Johnsen, 2002).
Another form of reﬂecting camouﬂage is provided by the cuticle of some scarab beetles. The
cuticle is made of structures that look like liquid crystals, mainly nematic and cholesteric. Thus, of
the incident light on the cuticle, the right circularly polarized component can be reﬂected and the
left circularly polarized light can penetrate the helicoidally structured cuticle. However, at a certain
depth, there is a layer of nematic structure that acts as a half-wave plate, reversing the sense of
polarization of the light, which is then reﬂected when it reaches the next layer of helicoidal
structure, has its sense of polarization reversed again by the nematic layer, and continues back
out through the helicoidal cuticle with very little loss.
The refractive index of the cuticle is
increased by the addition of uric acid. Thus the cuticle is an almost perfect reﬂector, making the
beetle appear the same green as its surroundings. This system will work only when the color and
light intensity are the same in all directions (Caveney, 1971).
13.3.7
Motion Camouﬂage
This is included here since it is a way of observing and approaching an object without making it
obvious to an observer or the object that it is being observed. The technique might have been
unintentionally deployed by attacking ﬁghter aircraft, and is currently in development for disguis-
ing the intended target of guided missiles. An everyday equivalent, converted to the acoustic
environment, would be that if you are following someone closely, make sure that the noise of
your footfall is in synchrony with that of your quarry.
This is a stealth shadowing technique used by, for instance, the dragonﬂy approaching its prey
on the wing. The dragonﬂy follows a path such that it always lies on a line connecting itself and a
ﬁxed point. Then the only visual cue to the dragonﬂy’s approach is its looming (i.e., the increase in
Defense and Attack Strategies and Mechanisms in Biology
349

the size of its image as it closes in on the object). The observer of the object thus sees no movement
away from the direction of the ﬁxed point. The ﬁxed point could be a part of the background against
which the dragonﬂy is camouﬂaged, or the initial position of the dragonﬂy, in which case the
dragonﬂy appears not to have moved from its starting point (Anderson and McOwan, 2003).
13.3.8
False Target Generation
A device that creates and presents an image of a target that causes a weapon to aim at a false
target. Used as a countermeasure to precision guided weapons (Alexander et al., 1996).
This is a common ploy in insects; for instance, butterﬂies have eye spots on the trailing edge of
the hind wing. Predating birds tend to aim for the eyes rather than the body of the insect, and so the
insect escapes with relatively slight damage to the hind wing. Similarly ﬁsh can have an eyespot on
the tail ﬁn with the true eye concealed in a dark marking across the head. A number of moth larvae
have a false ‘‘head’’ at the tail end which can simply be eye spots or an image of the head of another
animal such as a snake. The advantage then is not just that the attack will be at the ‘‘wrong’’ end of
the animal, thus protecting the nervous system, but that the animal will apparently move backwards
in order to escape.
A more sophisticated false target is generated by autotomy of part of the animal. A well-known
example is the salamander which leaves the end of its tail behind. A more sophisticated example
is provided by certain opilionids (harvestmen), which can autotomize a leg which will continue to
move and thus confuse and divert the predator whilst the putative prey makes its escape (Gnaspini
and Cavalheiro, 1998). Since the opilionid has eight legs (at least at the start of the chase) it can
employ this subterfuge a number of times. However, studies on wolf spiders (which play a similar
trick) show that the loss of a leg slows them down (Amaya et al., 1998).
13.4
BARRIERS
13.4.1
Slick Coating
Teﬂon lubricants that create a slippery surface because of their chemical properties. These
chemical agents reduce friction with the intent to inhibit the free movement of the target. In the
1960s Riotril (‘‘Instant Banana Peel’’) was applied as an ostensibly inert white powder to a hard
surface and wetted down. It then became like an ice slick. It is virtually impossible for an individual
to move or stand up on a hard surface so treated; tyres skid. Riotril, if allowed to dry, can easily be
peeled away or, because it’s water-soluble, can be washed away (Alexander et al., 1996).
A similar phenomenon is found in the carnivorous pitcher plants (Figure 13.3).
Several
mechanisms have been proposed for the way they capture insects, mostly slippery surface wax
crystals. But the important capture mechanism is due to the surface properties of the rim of the
pitcher, which has smooth radial ridges. This surface is completely wettable by nectar secreted by
the rim, and by rain water, so that a ﬁlm of liquid covers the surface when the weather is humid. The
rim is then slippery both for soft adhesive pads (the liquid sees to that) and for the claws, due to the
surface topography. This dual system starts sliding ants down the slippery slope (Bohn and Federle,
2004).
13.4.2
Sticky Coating
Polymer adhesives used to bond down equipment and human targets. Also known as stick’ems’ and
superadhesives (Alexander et al., 1996).
The best known biological adhesives are those occurring in spiders’ webs and those on the
leaves of the sundew, Drosera. Neither adhesive has yet been characterized.
350
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

The Peripatus (the velvet worm, Figure 13.4) shoots out sticky adhesive threads that entangle
its prey. The threads contain protein, sugar, lipid, and a surfactant, nonylphenol. The proteins
are the principal component of the slime; the amino acid composition suggests collagen. The
original function of the secretion was probably defense, developing into attack as the viscosity,
amount, and distance that the substance could be expelled all increased. This defensive substance
would in turn be also useful for hunting, if the original condition consisted of capturing prey
directly using mandibles, as when onychophorans handle small prey. The adhesive substance
probably allows the entanglement of larger and therefore more nutritious prey (Benkendorff et al.,
1999).
When in danger, some species discharge sticky threads that can entangle predators. Some like
the sea cucumber can even expel their internal organs, which they regrow causing it no harm at all.
Although the mechanical properties of the threads have not been measured, they are obviously very
Figure 13.3

platform onto which insects can walk.

Defense and Attack Strategies and Mechanisms in Biology

tough since the Palauan people of the south Paciﬁc squeeze the sea cucumber until it squirts out its
sticky threads, which they put on their feet to protect them when they walk around the reef.
When attacked, the centipede Henia rolls itself up with its ventral surface facing outward. This
is the opposite to most centipedes, which either attack with their large mandibles or roll up with
their dorsal surface — the most armored — facing outward. However, Henia has a large gland on
the underside of each segment which secretes an adhesive. The amount of adhesive is more than
10% of the body weight. The adhesive sticks to the mouthparts, etc., of the assailant preventing the
parts from working. While, the assailant retires to clean itself, the centipede escapes. The glue
seems to be made of two components: a ﬁbrous protein (possibly silk-like) and a globular protein,
which is the actual adhesive. At high magniﬁcation, the adhesive appears as a large number of ﬁne
ﬁbres stuck ﬁrmly at each end. Thus removing the adhesive is not as simple as initiating a crack and
propagating it; each ﬁbre has to be broken separately, taking a lot of time and effort (Hopkin et al.,
1990). The adhesive can stick to dirty wet surfaces, desirable for any technical adhesive. When
sticking two glass plates together it is as effective as a cyanoacrylate adhesive.
13.4.3
Sticky Foam
A name given to a polymer-based superadhesive agent. The technology ﬁrst began appearing in
commercial applications such as ‘‘super glue’’ and quick setting foam insulation. It is extremely
persistent and is virtually impossible to remove. Sticky foam came to public attention on February
28, 1995 when U.S. Marines used it in Mogadishu, Somalia, to prevent armed intruders from
impeding efforts to extricate United Nation forces from that country (Alexander et al., 1996).
A foam allows a limited amount of material to occupy a greater volume, and since the intent is to
impede rather than to entrap, the greater difﬁculty of breaking a structure that can accommodate
higher strains, and is made of multiple threads, contributes to the effectiveness of the mechanism.
This is probably why it occurs in the adhesive plaque which sticks the byssus thread of the mussel
onto the rock. Otherwise, foams in biology are more used for protection than for attack and are an
integral part of many egg cases, especially in snails and insects (e.g., Mantis, Locusta). They are
commonly made of protein, often phenolically tanned and waterproofed, although their primary
stability comes from their liquid crystalline structure (Neville, 1993)
13.4.4
Rope
Nylon rope dispersed by a compressed air launcher mounted on a truck (Alexander et al., 1996).
With animals the rope can become part of an entrapment mechanism — basically with an
adhesive device on the end of the rope. Examples are the ballistic snares of the chameleon and the
squid.
In the arms of the squid, transverse muscle provides the support required for the relatively slow
bending movements while in the tentacles the transverse muscle is responsible for the extremely
rapid elongation that occurs during prey capture. In the squid Loligo pealei, the thick ﬁlaments of
the obliquely striated muscle ﬁbres of the arms are approximately 7.4 mm long while those in the
cross-striated ﬁbres of the tentacle are approximately 0.8 mm long. This results in more series
elements per unit length of ﬁbre. Since shortening velocities of elements in series are additive, this
results in the shortening velocity of the tentacle ﬁbres to be approximately 15 L0 s1 compared with
the arm transverse muscle 1.5 L0 s1 at 198C.
The strike of L. pealei when it is capturing its prey takes as little as 20 ms. During the strike, the
proximal portion of the tentacle, the stalk, elongates. The nonextensible distal portion of the
tentacle, the club, contacts the prey and attaches using suckers. Extension takes 20 to 40 ms with
peak strains in the stalk of 0.43 to 0.8. Peak longitudinal strain rates vary from 23 to 45 s1. The
stalk can extend at over 2 ms1 at an acceleration of 250 ms2. Once the tentacular clubs have
contacted the prey, the stalks often buckle (Kier and Thompson, 2003).

13.4.5
Smoke
A thick, disorienting ‘‘cold smoke’’ that can be generated in areas from 2,000 to 50,000 cubic feet. It
restricts an intruders eye–hand coordination and interactions among members of an intruding
group. White obscuring smoke can be delivered by grenades or smoke pots. Relatively inexpensive,
noncontaminating and tactically ideal for police use. Obscuring smokes are temporarily irritating
to the nose and throat and cause those affected to lose their senses of purpose and direction
(Alexander et al., 1996).
Compared to smell, all the intricate color and shape changes of the octopus are ineffective. One
way to counter this threat is to block the predator’s sense of smell, which has been shown to be one
way in which the ink is used, though in large quantities. Obviously ink can be used to cover the
animal’s hasty departure, but it can also be used as a decoy, since the octopus or cuttleﬁsh can
produce a coherent plume of ink that is more or less of its own size and shape.
13.4.6
Stakes
A sharp stake, often of wood or bamboo, that is concealed in high grass, deep mud or pits. It is often
coated with excrement, and intended to wound and infect the feet of enemy soldiers. Can be utilized
both as a booby trap and as a barrier. Commonly known as punji stick or punji stakes (Alexander
et al., 1996).
The Komodo Dragon, Varanus komodoensis, the largest land-living lizard, feeds mainly on
carrion. Even though it is large and strong, mostly when it attacks living animals, it only wounds
rather than kills them. But even minor wounds often become septic, so septicemia seems to be a
signiﬁcant mechanism for weakening and eventually killing prey. However, when the dragons ﬁght
each other, they appear to suffer no ill effects, even though their ﬁghts are frequent and often result
in deep puncture wounds. If one could identify the bacteria in the dragon’s saliva, including those
capable of killing its mammalian prey, then one might have not only a chemical weapon but also its
antidote. Additionally the wounds made by the dragon bleed profusely and it takes longer for the
blood to clot, so the saliva also contains an anticoagulant.
13.5
BIOTECHNICALS
13.5.1
Hypodermic Syringe or Dart
Modiﬁed shotgun or handgun in which the projectile is a drug-ﬁlled syringe activated by a small
charge on impact. Wide variety of drugs available including emetics (Alexander et al., 1996).
Organisms have two methods of delivering poison: externally (on being attacked) and internally
(on being eaten). Since plants can usually afford to lose a leaf or two, they tend to have the poisons
internally and are not necessarily brightly colored as warning. Animals are either brightly colored
(for instance, the poison-dart frogs, Dendrobates spp. or poisonous nudibranchs or insects, q.v.) or
carry their poisons in spines or stings. Bees, wasps, and scorpions are obvious examples of the
latter; the sting is deployed, penetrates the victim with effort from the stinger, and poison is injected
from a sac which contracts. In hive bees and presumably others, the sting sac also releases a
pheromone which attracts other bees and encourages them to sting — rather like a beacon or marker
used in bombing raids. The urticaceous hair found on stinging nettles (Urtica spp.) and many
caterpillars is a passive mechanism. On the stinging nettle there are hollow hairs (Figure 13.5)
containing several irritating substances such as histamine (the mediator of some allergic reactions),
serotonin, acetylcholine, and formic acid. When lightly brushed against, the tip of the hair (made of
brittle silica) snaps off at an angle leaving a sharp tip that pierces the skin and delivers the cocktail.
A similar system operates in caterpillars. The urticating hairs or spines of the larva of the moth
Defense and Attack Strategies and Mechanisms in Biology
353

Automeris io (which is related to silkworms) are of two types, both having a poison gland (Gilmer,
1925). The chemical nature of the poisons is not fully known, though they can contain formic acid,
histamines, and enzymes which can dissolve human tissues and cause dermatitis. The spines work
very much like nettle stings. Severe allergic reaction can cause death. The skin bleeds after contact
with caterpillars of the Venezuelan Lonomia achelous which have poison spines containing an
anticoagulant.
13.5.2
Neuro-Implant
Computer implants into the brain that allow for behavioural modiﬁcation and control. Current
research is experimental in nature and focuses on lab animals such as mice (Alexander et al.,
1996).
There are several (probably many) parasites which affect the behavior of the host to the beneﬁt
of the parasite. The parasite can therefore be thought of reprogramming its host, though of course
the effective agent, being chemical, is far more subtle and would be much easier to administer.
Consider Dicrocoelium dendriticum, a parasitic worm; its main or primary host is sheep. The eggs
are released in the dung of the sheep and are eaten by the snail Cionella lubrica. The eggs develop
and the next stage (cercaria) is released into the snails mucus slime balls (which form in its
respiratory chamber) and deposited on vegetation. Ants (Formica fusca) then eat the slime balls.
Most of the cercaria become dormant in the ant’s abdomen. However, some of them migrate into
the ant’s head where they enter the nervous system of the ant and affect its behavior. As evening
approaches and the air cools, the infected ants, instead of returning to their nest, climb to the top of
Figure 13.5

354

the vegetation and clamp on to the leaves with their mandibles. They stay there immobile until the
next morning. The ants are thus likely to be eaten by passing sheep, thus completing the life cycle of
the parasite. Although the parasite is obviously far more complex than a computer chip, the change
in the ant’s behavior is minimal: the interaction of the insect’s temperature response with its
response to gravity.
13.5.3
Pheromones
The chemical substances released by animals to inﬂuence physiology or behavior of other members
of the same species. One use of pheromones, at the most elemental level, could be to mark target
individuals and then release bees to attack them. This would result in forcing them to exit an area or
abandon resistance (Alexander et al., 1996).
Lima beans (Phaseolus lunatus) infested with spider mites release chemicals that attract preda-
tory mites that then prey on the spider mites. The uninfected plants downwind also attract predatory
mites. Jasmonic acid sprayed onto tomato plants may regulate volatiles that attract parasitoid
wasps that prey on caterpillars feeding on the tomato plants. Such indirect defenses may be
even more complex. This may then be why some plants house and feed the predators as has
happened in ant plants. The ants can be considered to be an induced biotic defense because the
number of ants that patrol the leaves increases severalfold as a result of attraction by volatiles
emitted from the damaged tissue when a herbivore chews a leaf. The ants are acting as a Praetorian
body guard.
13.6
ELASTIC MECHANISMS
Human technology used elastic mechanisms as power ampliﬁcation of human or animal energy to
launch arrows and other projectiles; this approach is used in nature but man has replaced elastic
mechanisms with explosives.
The ability to escape quickly from a predator is vital for most prey,while predators have obvious
advantages if they are able to outrun fast prey and overpower it using even faster weapons.
The speed of running, jumping, predatory strikes, etc. is generally correlated with the animal’s
size. In order to achieve velocities comparable to those of larger animals, small ones such as
most arthropods have to rely on very high accelerations (Alexander and Bennet-Clark, 1977).
Therefore, in many insects, the speed of action reaches or even surpasses the velocity limitations
inherent in muscle contraction. Irrespective of phylogenetic relationships, convergent evolution has
resulted in special mechanical designs (e.g., springs or catapults) that overcome the constraints of
muscle action in many arthropods (Bennet-Clark and Lucey, 1967).
In addition to fast mechanics, both prey and predators rely on rapid neuronal and muscular
systems to initiate and control their swift escape or predatory actions. Among the ants, several
species employ particularly fast mandible strikes in order to catch swift prey or to defend
themselves. This so-called trap-jaw mechanism (a mandible strike which far exceeds the speed
allowed for by muscular contraction) has evolved independently in three ant species (Gronenberg,
1996). These studies reveal that the fast strike results from energy storage in a catapult design, and
its control relies on fast neurones and on a high velocity trigger muscle.
In biological elastic mechanisms, strain energy is stored only when the spring mechanism is
in the position from which the energy will be released — its loaded conﬁguration. This is in
contradistinction to most man-made systems, where the assumption of the loaded conﬁguration
is also the means by which the energy is stored (e.g., drawing a bow). For instance, the locust
brings its legs into the jumping position, then loads the main jumping tendon using muscle power.
This probably makes the system safer and allows a lower safety factor in the strength of the
components (Bennet-Clark, 1975).
Defense and Attack Strategies and Mechanisms in Biology
355

Nature commonly uses bistable mechanisms. This is intimately associated with the separation
of the assumption of the loaded conﬁguration from the storage of strain energy. The mechanism
is drawn over center by the main spring, and then the spring is loaded. The main spring has a low
mechanical advantage and can store a large amount of strain energy, generating high forces.
When the system is ‘‘ﬁred’’ the trigger, which can generate only a low force but has a high
mechanical advantage, allows the mechanism to move back over center and the energy from the
main spring is fed into the system (Bennet-Clark and Lucey, 1967). This has the advantage that
there are no ﬁring pins or hooks to jam or break. Thus, control is smoother and reliability
improved. In the snap-jaw ant, the mandibles are clicked against each other, rather like snapping
ﬁnger and thumb over each other. The ant can then move comparatively massive objects. The
mandibles are ﬁrst held with the tips just touching, then loaded. Large muscles contract against
the closed mandibles that are thus bent and store some elastic energy. However, most of the
muscular energy is transformed and elastically stored within the apodeme and its cuticular
threads, within the muscle ﬁbres and probably also within the entire head capsule. Slight rotation
of one of the mandibles then causes its lower edge to bend slightly inwards and lets the other
mandible slide above it, powered by the strain energy stored within the contracted muscles and
the mandible shaft (Gronenberg et al., 1998). Immediately afterwards the unstimulated mandible
hits the object and bounces it away. The stored energy thus is spent and the mandibles are
decelerated during the second half of their trajectory and come to a hold before they could bump
into the front of the head.
The Venus ﬂy trap (Dionaea muscipula) preys on insects and other small animals that venture
onto its trap leaves and trigger their closure by disturbing certain sensitive hairs. The leaves
routinely shut in 1/25 s. Such speed of movement is uncommon amongst plants and so has attracted
attention and theories for many years. The mechanism is based on a turgor-driven elastic instability
of the leaf, which is in effect a prestressed mechanical bistable structure (Forterre et al., 2005;
Thom, 1975). A better understanding of this mechanism and the way in which it is designed and
actuated would not only solve a long-standing conundrum, but could also give rise to a series of
novel hydraulic actuators and switches.
Nature does use explosives, in the sense that an explosive chemical reaction proceeds at very
high speed, is exothermic, and produces large amounts of hot gas that do the damage. The insect
in question is the bombardier beetle, of which there are many species, for example Brachinus
explodens, which produces a jet of steam and hydroquinone at a temperature probably in excess of
1008C. The propellant is oxygen produced from the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide. The jet is
pulsed (at about 500 Hz) and can, depending on the species of beetle, be aimed very accurately
(Dean et al., 1990).
13.7
ELECTRICAL
13.7.1
Stun Gun
A small, two-pronged, hand held electrical discharge weapon. Effective range is less than an arm
length. It works by affecting the muscle signal paths, disturbing the nervous system (Alexander
et al., 1996).
The electric eel is different from other electric ﬁsh in its ability to generate a stunning or even a
killing electrical discharge. The electric eel can produce up to 600 V in a single discharge. The
electric organ, which consists of a series of modiﬁed tail muscles, is similar to a row of batteries
connected in a series. It is subdivided into three sections: two small and one large. One small battery
is used for navigational signals. The large battery and the other small one are used to generate the
stunning discharge. After delivering a strong shock, the electric eel must then allow the electric
organ to recharge (Heiligenberg, 1977).
356
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

A discharge from an electric eel can kill the small ﬁsh that are its primary food, but electric eels
can also shock potential predators. A touch from the electric eel’s tail can effectively disable a
human or a large animal with a stunning shock, although a single discharge is usually not enough to
kill. However, repeated shocks could kill.
13.8
ENTANGLERS
13.8.1
Bola
Device consisting of two or three heavy balls attached by one or two ropes or cords and used for
entanglement purposes. It is twirled overhead in one hand and hurled or cast at the intended target.
Designed to entangle legs to retard or stop movement. Probably an ancient weapon, but made
famous by the gauchos of South America, who used them to catch cattle and ostriches (Alexander
et al., 1996).
Ordgarius magniﬁcus, the Australian bola spider, hides in a silk-lined retreat among the
leaves of native trees such as eucalypts. At night it hangs, head down, from a horizontal silk
strand, and using an extended front leg, suspends a silk thread about 4 cm long with a sticky blob on
the end (Figure 13.6). Thread þ blob ¼ bola. The blob contains an attractant moth pheromone.
When the spider detects the vibrations in the air made by an attracted moth ﬂying close, it begins to
jerk its body so as to swing the bola around in a circle. When the moth is close enough, she lets
the thread run then ﬂicks it to hit the moth. The moth is then entangled, the spider reels it in, wraps
it in silk and sucks it dry. Different pheromones are used for different seasons or growth stages
to capture the moth species that are available or are of best size. The difference is that whilst
in technology the target is probably running away, in nature it is ﬂying towards you, with
friendly intent!

13.8.2
Cloggers
Polymer agents, sticky-soft plastics, used in burst munitions to clog up jet and tank engine intakes
(Alexander et al., 1996).
Hagﬁsh slime is a mixture of mucus and threadlike ﬁbres, secreted in concentrated form from
pores on the side of the hagﬁsh’s body. Upon contact with the seawater, the slime absorbs water
rapidly, expands into a sticky gel that can ensnare and sometimes suffocate an attacker. Up to 5 l
of gel can be produced within seconds (Koch et al., 1991). We are probably missing a trick by
producing only single-phase ‘‘cloggers.’’ The addition of ﬁbres would greatly increase the coher-
ence of the clogging substrate, generating a compliant ﬁbrous composite material.
The hagﬁsh rids itself of the mucus by tying itself into a knot that it runs down its body pushing
the mucus ahead of it (Fernholm, 1981). Over the ranges of temperature encountered by the hagﬁsh,
the gel strength is relatively independent of temperature, which perhaps ensures that slime is an
effective defense in a variety of conditions.
13.9
PROJECTILE
13.9.1
Water Stream
Mobile unit that projects a continuing stream of water for riot control purposes (Alexander
et al., 1996).
The archer ﬁsh (Toxotes jaculator) is the best-known analog, though it conserves its energy by
aiming the jet of water very carefully and bringing down one object at a time. The object is usually an
insect or other small animal sitting on a plant overhanging the water. With the tongue against a
groove on the roof of the mouth, the ﬁsh forms a tube, and forces water out by snapping the gills shut.
The jet of water is directed with the tip of the tongue. The ﬁsh can squirt up to seven times in quick
succession, and the jet can reach 2 to 3 m, but it is accurate to only 1 to 1.5 m. Fish as small as 2 to 3 cm
long can already spit, but their jets reach only 10 to 20 cm (Rossel et al., 2002). The disadvantage
of this technique is obviously that when the dislodged prey falls into the water, it can be taken by
any of the other ﬁsh. So the archer tends to position itself below the prey, and also knows how to
catch an object falling on a curved trajectory, a skill that would make it a good ball player!
13.10
RIOT CONTROL AGENT
13.10.1
Chemical Mace
Small spray can containing a 0.9% solution of agent CN in a variety of petroleum-based carriers
including a mixed freon/hydrocarbon solvent. First introduced in 1966. CSMace then developed in
1968 by suggestion of the U.S. Army (Alexander et al., 1996).
Chemical agents produced by animals or plants tend to be for defense, sometimes against a
single individual and sometimes against large numbers. Carnivorous ground- and water-beetles
(Adephaga) are some of the better known animals that deliver compounds in one of three ways:
(1)
Oozing: The glands of many beetles do not have muscles for discharging large amounts of
substance and so the material only oozes out from the openings. This is helped by internal pressure.
(2)
Forceful spraying: Many ground beetles have intrinsic muscles with the glands. The beetle
Pasimachus subsulcatus can forcibly discharge a spray up to several centimetres that is irritating
to the eyes and hurts abraded skin.
(3)
Crepitation or squirting is characteristic of bombardier beetles (q.v.). Hydroquinones are stored
with hydrogen peroxide in the major gland chambers and the ezymes catalase (which converts
358
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen) and peroxidase are stored in an accessory chamber. When
the beetle is disturbed, these compounds are mixed. This produces a strongly exothermic reaction
that generates quinines, discharged as a vapour of about 1008C, an effective deterrent against
predators. The emission occurs as a pulsed jet rather than as a steady stream that allows for a higher
discharge velocity due to increased pressure in the reaction chamber (Dean et al., 1990).
Many compounds in these beetles have been implicated as toxins or feeding deterrents against
predators; the secretions are usually mixtures of a number of components. Some surfactant
components may help the toxic compounds penetrate the skin of a predator.
Amongst sea birds, fulmars are well-known masters of the art of projectile vomiting. Also they
are exceptionally courageous and will stay by their single egg if people come close. They are mostly
silent apart from a low cackling noise made to other fulmars. So the ﬁrst a person may know of the
presence of a fulmar is a stream of foul and evil-smelling orange vomit spewing straight into their
eyes from a few feet away. Even a young fulmar chick can do this.
Spitting cobras also ﬁgure here among projectile vomitters.
13.11
OPERATIONAL
13.11.1
Long-Term Disablement
The outcome of the application of nonlethal force that affects the opponent beyond duration of the
confrontation or conﬂict. Blinding, maiming or psychologically deranging the opponent represent
forms of long-term disablement. This form of disablement burdens a society and is anathema to the
Western deﬁnition of nonlethality (Alexander et al., 1996).
Few animal encounters end with disablement — the tendency is for the victor to eat the
vanquished. This is not true of herbivores, of course, when the ﬁght will be in dispute of territory
or reproductive access to a harem. Deer, whose antlers grow afresh every year, can cope with the
30% breakage which results from ﬁghts in the rutting season (Kitchener, 1987), although they may
get wounded on the ﬂank. On the other hand, sheep, goats, and antelope, whose horns grow from the
root and are not renewed annually, lose the ability to ﬁght if the horn is broken and thus cease to
be reproductively active. It is likely that only amongst elephants and cetaceans is there any care
for the disabled; social carnivores (wolves, lions, wild dogs) also show some concern. Otherwise
the injured die and are no further burden.
13.11.2
Passive Deterrents
Non-lethal weapons that do not affect the physiology of the target individual. Includes dyes,
personal alarms, and scent sprays (Alexander et al., 1996).
The best-known animal using a similar technique is the striped skunk that has about a table-
spoonful of oily yellow musk in its scent glands located at its anus. This will produce ﬁve or six
sprays, each of which is accurate and can travel up to 5 m. The mist from the spray can travel 10 to
15 m with the smell carrying up to 2 km. A great many insects produce repellant chemicals (q.v.).
13.12
PHYSIOLOGICAL
13.12.1
Neurochemical
There are many neurotoxins. For instance, a sea anemone uses its tentacles to capture prey and
defend itself against predators. Every tentacle is covered with thousands of tiny stinging capsules
Defense and Attack Strategies and Mechanisms in Biology
359

called nematocysts about 5 mm across. Each capsule contains a coiled hollow thread with a barb at
the end. The capsules contain a poison capable of paralysing or killing small animals. When a small
animal contacts the tentacles, the capsules are triggered and ﬁre their barbed threads like harpoons,
which pierce the skin of the animal and inject their poison. In the fresh-water polyp Hydra vulgaris,
the capsule contains a 2 M salt solution and so reaches a turgor pressure of 150 atmospheres (15
MPa) before it shoots out the dart at an acceleration of 40,000 g (Holstein et al., 1994). The sea
anemone uses its stinging cells for defense, as do other animals. The digestive tract of the
nudibranch sea slug Aeolidia (a sort of snail) is lined with a protective coating to prevent injury
from any unactivated nematocysts it consumes, which it then transports into its skin to use for its
own defense. Sea anemones also use their poisonous stings against their own kind, usually while
competing for territory. Some species even possess special club-like structures, packed with potent
stinging capsules, that they use to battle other anemones. Territorial ﬁghts often result in serious
injury and even death to one or both anemones.
13.12.2
Diversion
A diversion that acts directly by affecting one or more of the ﬁve senses. Noise that lasts less than
one second (Alexander et al., 1996).
An obvious example from biology is ﬂash coloration and its commonest manifestation is in the
hind wings of cryptically colored moths with brightly colored hind wings that are revealed suddenly
when the insect is threatened. The hind wings can be of one or two colors in well-deﬁned patches
(often red or yellow with black) or have large and colorful eyespots (Figure 13.7). Another well-
known example is feigning injury; the lapwing nests on the ground and will lure a potential predator
away from its nest by dragging one wing on the ground with the pretence that it is broken. When the
predator is safely away from the nest, the lapwing ﬂies away.
13.13
SURVEILLANCE
13.13.1
Electrosensing
A ‘sixth sense’ based on reception of electrical signals in the environment. Akin to electronic
eavesdropping.
Teleost (bony) ﬁsh, elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) and the duckbilled platypus (and probably
many more types of animals) have an electric sense. It is best developed in the elasmobranchs,
which have rows of pit organs (ampullae of Lorenzini) that can detect electric ﬁelds as weak as
Figure 13.7

warning- or ﬂash- (below) wing positions.

5 nV cm1 and so detect the ﬁelds induced through their bodies as they swim through the earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld. They can use this sense to detect the presence of prey and there is evidence
that they also use it in navigation. However, the electroreceptors cannot measure DC voltages
so that a voltage due to water ﬂow in the ocean is not uniquely interpretable in terms of the
speed and direction of ﬂow at the point where the electrical measurement is made. Perhaps the
cue is the directional asymmetry of the change in induced electroreceptor voltage during
turns. A neural network could use this cue to determine swimming direction by comparing
electrosensory signals and signals from the semicircular canals of the inner ear, which function
as an accelerometer (Kajiura and Holland, 2002). Weakly electric ﬁsh such as nocturnal ﬁsh and
the gymnotids and mormyrids of the murky waters of the Amazon use active electrolocation — the
generation and detection of electric currents — to explore their surroundings. Although electro-
sensory systems include some of the most extensively understood circuits in the vertebrate central
nervous system, relatively little is known quantitatively about how ﬁsh electrolocate objects (Assad
et al., 1999).
13.14
CONCLUSIONS
Biomimetics is not a particularly new study, but it seems to be generating success. It is possible to
calculate the number of functions of biology that appear in a technical environment, which is about
a 10% overlap. This does not mean that the route has been biomimetic, but it does mean that the
technology has been transferred. The transfer has so far been somewhat adventitious, so a chapter
like this one can perhaps not so much report what has been successful (not a lot), but what might be
successful. The difference is: how many of the possibilities have been tried? This chapter is more a
list of things to do than of things done.

INTRODUCTION
The biological world utilizes an amazing range of materials that provide function and survival to
organisms faced with a wide range of environmental threats. The biosynthesis, processing, and
assembly of these materials provide insight into design rules and strategies that can serve as useful
templates for broader materials science and engineering needs. High strength ﬁbers, toughened
organic–inorganic composites, designs for efﬁcient ﬂuid ﬂow, adhesion mechanisms, and actuators
are examples reviewed herein. The knowledge gained from the study of these types of complex high
performance materials systems should continue to stimulate new directions in materials science,
including new hybrid systems to exploit the strengths and utility of both biological and synthetic
versions of future materials designs.
The ﬁeld of biomimetics encompasses a broad range of topics, generally based on the concept
of ‘‘learning from Nature’’ in areas of materials science and engineering. This ‘‘learning’’ may be
through inspiration in design, function, or a combination of both. Usually, this inspiration derives
from a novel attribute of a biological system that suggests new and important insights into structure
and function for materials science applications. Examples used in this chapter illustrate features of
unique materials from Nature to inspire designs and functions for new materials: (a) silk proteins
used by spiders and silkworms to construct composite encasements (cocoons) or strong and
365

functional webs to entrap prey; (b) organic–inorganic composite structures found in sea shells to
form highly engineered, hard, tough materials; (c) surfaces such as shark skin to reduce hydro-
dynamic friction; (d) modes of ‘‘sticking’’ to surfaces used by the gecko to produce strong
adhesives; and (e) muscles in the human body to create highly engineered actuators. These
examples, optimized through evolution, provide a range of topics for inspiration in materials
designs and functions. They also provide generic insight into the underlying principles employed
by biological systems to achieve remarkable plasticity in materials structure and function.
Each of the topics listed above is reviewed with a focus on what is currently understood in
terms of structure and function, a mechanistic view of the system, and the current state of the art
in mimicking these systems. It will be obvious at the end of this chapter that the learning curve is
barely past the lag phase (microbial growth curve perspective). It is also worth considering that
we are inherently limited in gaining additional insight into these systems due to the complexity of
the biological systems of interest, our current limited understanding of their structure and
function, and our preconceived bias of how to understand these systems due to training or
perspective from more traditional materials science and engineering approaches. The excitement
with Nature as a guide to materials science and engineering is that this is only the beginning and
there is a lot to be learned in order to elucidate the ‘‘rules’’ that govern the processes involved.

COMPARISONS: BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS
AND SYNTHETIC MATERIALS: SYNTHESIS AND ASSEMBLY
At the core of this chapter are the novel ‘‘rules’’ that govern materials formation in Nature. These
rules originate from the template-based synthesis driven by genetic blueprints. Furthermore, the
building blocks (e.g., amino acids, sugars, nucleic acids) are linked (via enzymatic coupling
reactions) into polymers with control of stereochemistry to affect regularity in chemistry and thus
higher order interactions (intra and interchain). These polymeric building blocks (proteins, poly-
saccharides, nucleic acids, and other biological macromolecules) are therefore ‘‘programmed’’
(chemically and physically) to self-organize into more complex materials through hierarchical
structural complexity that gives rise to novel materials performance. The control of this structural
hierarchy initiates with the regularity in structure at the individual monomer and chain levels, and is
propagated up length scales from the molecular (chains), through the mesoscopic (mesophases), and
ﬁnally to the macroscopic (material ultrastructure) level. Remarkably, these processes occur within a
complex mixture of small and large molecules inside and outside of the sites of synthesis (cells).
Compartmentalization helps in these processes, along with membrane interfaces. Most of the
details involved in these processes are largely unexplored territory scientiﬁcally. The entire materials
assembly process is governed by the interplay between genetic programs, environmental conditions
inside and outside of the cells, and the remarkable speciﬁcity and control achieved through enzym-
atic processes. Historically, these hierarchical interactions have been studied from the ‘‘top-down’’
or at the macro-scale, using electron microscopy to interrogate ultrastructure, or by testing mechan-
ical properties of the materials and using this to interpret structural organization. In recent years, the
focus of inquiry has shifted to the ‘‘bottom-up’’ paradigm, molecular-level interactions.
Polymer assembly as the basis for structural hierarchy and function in biology is most often
governed by many weak bonds (hydrogen bonding, van der Waal). It is the high frequency and
location of these types of bonds that allow assembly or disassembly of these material systems
within reasonable energy demands to permit functions (e.g., such as denaturation and renaturation
(replication fork) of DNA during semiconservative replication). These processes are mediated by
water, structure, and location, with respect to the organic components and features such as
hydrophobic hydration play a major role in the processes. General themes to consider that contrast
the process of materials formation and assembly in Nature vs. in the laboratory via synthetic
approaches are listed in Table 14.1.

14.2.1
Silk Processing and Assembly by Insects and Spiders
— High Performance Fibers from Nature
Background — Silks are externally spun protein ﬁbers generated by spiders and insects (Kaplan
et al., 1994). Reeled silkworm silk (Bombyx mori) has been used in the textile industry for over 5,000
years. Unlike silkworm silks, spider silk production has not been domesticated because spiders are
more difﬁcult to raise in large numbers due to their solitary and predatory nature. In addition, orb
webs are not reelable as a single ﬁber and they generate only small quantities of silk. Silkworms can
be raised in large numbers and generate one type of silk at one stage in their lifecycle, forming the
basis for the sericulture industry. Many spiders have evolved families of silk proteins (different
polymer chain chemistries — primary amino acid sequences) with different functions. For example,
the spider, Nephila clavipes, generates at least six different silks from sets of different glands, each
silk speciﬁcally matched to function — such as for environmental glues, strong or ﬂexible web
components, prey capture, and encapsulation (cocoons) for offspring development.
Silks are of interest for their remarkable mechanical properties as well as their durability, luster,
and ‘‘feel.’’ Silk ﬁbers generated by spiders and silkworms represent the strongest natural ﬁbers
known, even rivaling synthetic high performance ﬁbers in terms of mechanical properties (Gosline
et al., 1986). The best properties of N. clavipes native dragline ﬁbers collected and tested at quasi
static rates were 60 and 2.9 GPa for initial modulus and ultimate tensile strength, respectively. In
addition, these ﬁbers display resistance to mechanical compression that distinguishes them from
other high performance ﬁbers (Cunniff et al., 1994). Based on microscopic evaluations of knotted
single ﬁbers, no evidence of kink-band failure on the compressive side of a knot curve was
observed. Synthetic high performance ﬁbers fail by this mode even at relatively low stress levels.
Silks are mechanically stable up to almost 2008C (Cunniff et al., 1994).
Spider dragline and silkworm cocoon silks are considered semicrystalline materials with the
crystalline components termed b-sheets (Gosline et al., 1986). Most silks assume a range of
different secondary structures during processing from water-soluble protein in the glands to
water-insoluble spun ﬁbers. Marsh et al. (1955) ﬁrst described the crystalline structure of silk as
an antiparallel hydrogen bonded b-sheet. The unit cell parameters in the silk II structure (the spun

form of silk that is insoluble in water) are: 0.94 nm (interchain), 0.697 nm (ﬁber axis), 0.92 nm
(intersheet). These unit cell dimensions are consistent with a crystalline structure in which the
protein chains run antiparallel with interchain hydrogen bonds perpendicular to the chain axis
between carbonyl and amine groups, and van der Waal forces stabilizing the intersheet interactions
(based on the predominance of short side chain amino acids such as glycine, alanine, and serine in
b-sheet regions). Generally, silkworm ﬁbroin in cocoons contains a higher content of crystallinity
(b-sheet content) than spider dragline silks such as from N. clavipes.
As more protein sequence data from various spiders and silkworms has been elucidated, it is
clear that these families of silk proteins are similar but also encompass a range of sequence
variations that reﬂect their functional properties. Silkworm ﬁbroin is the protein that forms the
structural aspects of the ﬁbers. These ﬁbers are encased in a family of glue-like sericin proteins. The
primary sequence of amino acids of these proteins is found to be highly repeated, thus, small
regions of sequence chemistry in the protein chain are found elsewhere in other regions of the
chains. This design feature is critical to the function of this group of proteins as structural materials.
This design feature also allows the sequences of these large proteins to be represented in relatively
short sequences in terms of polymer design. This has led to the option of forming synthetic genetic
variants to represent the larger proteins, a useful laboratory technique to enhance the ability to
understand these proteins in a simpliﬁed form. These shorter genetic pieces can be polymerized
(multimerized) into longer genes to explore sequence and size relationships. These powerful tools
in molecular biology facilitate direct insight into the role of sequence chemistry, protein block sizes
and distributions, and protein polymer chain length on materials structure and function. Native and
synthetic silk clones have been generated in a variety of heterologous expression systems, including
bacteria, yeast, insect cells, plants, and mammalian cells (Wong and Kaplan, 2002).
Mechanism — Silk proteins are hydrophobic based on the predominance of glycine and alanine
amino acids. The chains self-assemble into insoluble b-sheets. Spiders and silkworm keep these
hydrophobic proteins soluble in water during their processing into ﬁbers at concentrations up to 30
weight percent. The formation of liquid crystalline phases during silk processing has been reported
as part of this process (Vollrath and Knight, 2001). This process is accomplished in vivo without
premature crystallization into the insoluble b-sheets. Premature crystallization would be cata-
strophic for the animal as it would clog the spinning device. In recent studies, micelle and gel
states were identiﬁed that suggest these are important steps governing chain silk protein interactions
toward organized silk structures. These features can be duplicated in part using regenerated
silkworm silk and the control of water removal from aqueous solutions of these proteins via
osmotic stress (Jin and Kaplan, 2003). These ‘‘soft’’ micelles consist of ﬂexible molecules and
the structures can grow and change shape in response to changes in protein concentration. This is
typical behavior of amphiphilic ﬂexible surfactants that assemble into small spherical micelles and
evolve morphologically into cylinders and lamellar-layered structures. Lyotropic liquid crystalline
phase behavior can help explain the assembly of silk protein polymer chains into domains of high
concentration (Vollrath and Knight, 2001), with orientation driven by micellar behavior and water
efﬂux through channels in these structures.
Based on the micellar behavior and subsequent morphological features generated during silk
processing, critical design rules (chemistry of the amino acid sequence and blocks or regions of the
sequence chemistry) to match the processing environment have been described (Bini et al., 2004).
These design rules demonstrate a modiﬁed triblock design for these proteins that also contrasts in
important ways with traditional synthetic triblock co-polymers. In silks, the large (dominating in
size and chemical inﬂuence) internal hydrophobic blocks (crystallizable domains which promote
intra and interchain folding) are interrupted with very short hydrophilic blocks or spacers, puta-
tively to control water content in micellar states to prevent premature crystallization into b-sheets.
The large N- and C-terminal hydrophilic blocks interact with water and deﬁne micellar partitioning.
All protein sequences in silks adopt these general block ‘‘design rules’’ (Bini et al., 2004)
presumably to match the limits of the all aqueous processing environment. There is, however,
368
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

signiﬁcant sequence (chemistry) variability permitted in the hydrophobic or dominant regions of
the protein which give rise to the variations in functional properties of the different silks. In the ﬁnal
step of the process of formation of silk ﬁbers, the assembled proteins are spun through oriﬁces in the
abdomen of spiders or mouth of silkworms, inducing the structural and morphological transition of
the gel state from the gland into the b-sheet structure and ﬁber morphology. The spun ﬁbers are
insoluble in water.
In general, the combined control of sequence chemistry and processing conditions is central to
the successful formation of high-performance ﬁbers based on silk proteins. Included in this is the
presence of suitable blocks and chemical features of these blocks to deal with the processing
environment and the appropriate mechanical properties. To date, no successful example has been
reported of spinning recombinant or reconstituted silk proteins that emulate the full range of novel
mechanical properties of silkworm or spider silk ﬁbers.
Mimetic Systems — Many aspects of the silk spinning process can be mimicked in vitro and the
all-aqueous environment used is instructive as a model for polymer processing, in general. Employ-
ing new insights into silk ﬁbroin solubility and assembly has permitted new forms of these protein-
based materials to be generated. For example, porous 3-D sponges have been formed from
regenerated silk ﬁbroin (Nazarov et al., 2004). Blending silk ﬁbroin and polyethylene oxide to
obtain sufﬁcient solution viscosity suitable for electrospinning to generate nanoscale-diameter
ﬁbers has also been reported (Jin et al., 2002). The insights into silk protein assembly have been
utilized toward the formation of patterned peptide multilayer thin ﬁlms with nanoscale order
(Valluzzi et al., 2003). This engineered liquid crystallinity to form smectic layers was generated
with thin ﬁlms and bulk materials, with tunability of the layer thickness and patterning based on
sequence design and chain length. In addition to recapitulation of the silk assembly process in vitro
as outlined above based on new insight into the process of silk protein–protein interactions, efforts
are underway in many laboratories to develop synthetic analogs of silk. For example, copolymers of
glycine–alanine repeats (hard segements, b-sheet formation) with polyethylene glycol (soft seg-
ments) have been studied to provide fundamental insight into control of polymer assembly and
structure (Rathore and Sogah, 2001).
With continuing advances in genetic engineering, improved quantities and the availability of
additional sequence variants of silk proteins can be anticipated. These materials, combined with
new understanding of aqueous processing of these polymers, should help with continued improve-
ments in the ability to generate silk-based materials for a wide range of potential utility. At the same
time, novel polymer mimics of these systems in which the key design rules are considered will
continue to emerge. Finally, with the wealth of silk protein sequence–structure–function data being
generated from the study of different silks, this family of unusual protein polymers can serve as a
blueprint for future designs and engineering to develop synthetic analogs using more traditional
synthetic polymer approaches.
14.2.2
Seashells — High Performance Organic–Inorganic Composites from Nature
Background — The shells of mollusks exhibit exceptional toughness, despite compositions of
predominately brittle inorganic salts. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3), or ‘‘chalk’’ comprises up to 98%
of the content of many of these shells, with the remaining few percent consisting of proteins and
glycoproteins (Levi-Kalisman et al., 2001). The organic components create a molecular-level
template for control of nucleation and crystal growth. The mechanical strength of these shells
can be attributed to these molecular interfaces as well as the complex hierarchal structure consisting
of ordered lamellae or layers (Song et al., 2003). The nacreous layer, the interior lining of seashells,
exhibits three orders of magnitude increased mechanical strength when compared to pure aragonite
crystals (Almqvist et al., 1999). Aragonite, calcite, and vaterite are polymorphs of these calcium
salts with the same chemical composition (CaCO3), but different crystal shape, size, and symmetry.
In the nacreous layer, these inorganic ‘‘bricks’’ are polygonal aragonite tablets separated by a thin
Biological Materials in Engineering Mechanisms
369

layer of soluble and insoluble proteins (predominately) that act as the ‘‘mortar.’’ Soluble, aspartic
acid-rich glycoproteins direct crystal formation by binding with calcium leading to the formation of
aragonite crystals. Depending on the species, the organic matrix also consists of insoluble b-chitin
and silk-like proteins that do not contribute to the mineralization process directly, but function by
establishing a more rigid scaffold in part responsible for the superior fracture toughness and
strength associated with these shells. In recent studies, some of these concepts were studied through
the isolation of speciﬁc proteins or groups of proteins from native mollusks and utilized in studies of
controlled mineralization, such as for the formation of biopearls (Zaremba et al., 1996). It is also
worth noting that other organic–inorganic composites in nature, such as bone and tooth enamel, are
similarly organized in terms of organic templates and molecular scale interactions, although the
speciﬁc organic components are different. For example, collagens represent the bulk of the organic
matrix in these composites and hydroxyapatite is the major inorganic component.
Mechanism — Unlike the mortar in a brick wall, the organic matrix of the nacreous layer in
mollusk shells is ﬂexible and contributes to the strength and toughness of the shell by absorbing and
displacing stress applied to the aragonite tablets. Insoluble ﬁbers bind to the aragonite tablets at
the optimized inorganic interface, acting as a natural adhesive between the layers. In addition, the
organic matrix acts to dissipate crack propagation (Pokroy and Zolotoyabko, 2003). The fracture
toughness of these types of structures is directly related to the presence of speciﬁc proteins in
the organic matrix with domains characteristic of elastic behavior based on the amino acid sequence
chemistry. For example, studies of nacre with Atomic Force Microscopy illustrated stepwise
unfolding of the associated proteins, reﬂective of this elastic behavior (Smith et al., 1999). Speciﬁc
proteins have been isolated and ascribed with these features, such as Lustrin A, which contains
cysteine- and porline-rich domains (Zhang et al., 2002). Other domains in this protein also appear to
provide regions with direct interactions with the aragonite component of nacre (Wustman et al.,
2002).
Biomimetics — To form relatively inexpensive materials that mimic the mechanical features of
nacre, weak interfaces have been layered between sheets of ceramics. In this method each layer of
ceramic is approximately 200 mm thick and is cut from a larger sheet made by treating silicon
carbide powder with boron to create a pliable material. The silicon carbide layers are coated with
graphite and subsequently pressed together and sintered at 20008C. The resulting material has a
fourfold increase in fracture toughness when compared to monolithic silicon carbide, requiring 100
times the amount of work to break the layered ceramic (Clegg et al., 1990). This ceramic material
also offers increased heat resistance, which contributed to its successful testing as a combustion
liner for gas turbine engines. Although this ceramic mimics nacre, it does not harness the strength
and toughness associated with the nano-scale architecture found in biocomposites such as nacre,
bone, and coral. The ability to manufacture materials that resemble nacre structure and properties
has been approached using alternating layers of clay and polymer. Unlike the self-assembling
components of nacre, this artiﬁcial nacre is prepared by physically applying sequential layers of
negatively charged clay, montmorillonite, and positively charged polyelectrolytes, poly(diallydi-
methylammonium) chloride. The high afﬁnity between the two components induces a strong
inorganic/organic interface. Under stress, these sacriﬁcial bonds are broken to allow platelet
movement, which results in displacement of force much like the organic matrix of the nacreous
layer. Two hundred sequential clay and polymer layers resulted in the formation of a ﬁlm with a
thickness of 4.9 mm, thus each clay or polymer layer had an average thickness of 250 nm (Tang
et al., 2003). This ﬁlm exhibited similar mechanical properties to nacreous layers.
The self-assembly of the shell components is an attractive feature because this ensures highly
speciﬁc spacing, alignment, and placement of material components at small length scales, a feature
more difﬁcult to attain by current synthetic fabrication methods. Molecular erector sets have been
proposed to mimic this self-assembly process by employing cell-surface and phage display tech-
nologies, which can produce polypeptide sequences that speciﬁcally interact with an inorganic
surface with high afﬁnity (Sarikaya et al., 2003). The development of molecular erector sets is

under study in a number of laboratories and uniformly thin layers over inorganic surfaces have been
generated (Tamerler et al., 2003).
14.2.3
Shark Skin — Biological Approaches to Efﬁcient Swimming
Via Control of Fluid Dynamics
Background — Sharks are in the class Chondrichthyes, or cartilaginous ﬁsh that includes rays,
skates, and others. The dermis is composed of collagen type I ﬁbers organized in helices around the
shark’s body in alternating layers that form 50 to 708 angles with each layer between the pectoral
and anal ﬁns and 45 to 508 angles in the thin caudal peduncle just in front of the tail. The epidermis
is covered with placoid scales called dermal denticles, which are like thousands of teeth embedded
in the skin. Unlike the scales of ﬁsh, which in most species tend to be broad and ﬂat, placoid scales
of sharks are pointed with a basal plate, a pedicel, and a crown enclosure. The denticles vary among
species and as sharks age, the number of scales increases. The scales are compared to teeth, given
that each is covered by dentine and composed of enamel and have a pulp cavity. Denticles vary
widely in size among species. For example, the nurse shark has denticles that are so large and so
closely spaced that they can form a barrier against even harpoons. The morphologies vary including
blunt, scalloped, spade-shaped, thorn-like, geometric, and heart-shaped. Occasionally, denticles
develop independently and become comparatively gigantic structures as in the ﬁn spine, a thorn-
like quill, in the spiny dogﬁsh and Port Jackson shark, or the tooth found in the sawﬁsh and the
stinger of stingrays.
Mechanism — The roughness of shark skin is paradoxical to principles of ﬂuid dynamics since
rough surfaces increase drag, and shark skin is considered rough due to the denticles. However, the
rough texture of shark skin reduces drag due to the presence of microscopic riblets on the surface of
the skin. Riblets channel the laminar ﬂow over the skin to further reduce drag after the larger
structures, the denticles, create a boundary against turbulent ﬂow. The water is channeled through
the small valleys created by the microscopic ridges, speeding up the ﬂow of water over the surface
of skin. Without the riblets and denticles, the water would ﬂow over smooth skin and suffer the full
effects of friction. The ridges on the denticles, like the ridge that runs longitudinally along the
shark’s body, help in drag reduction and in the smoothing boundary layer turbulence. The efﬁciency
of shark skin and shark swimming in water originates in principles of ﬂuid dynamics. Body
geometries, movements, and wake evolution have been modeled (Cheng and Chahine, 2001).
The structure and dynamic behavior of the vortex wakes generated by a swimming body are
responsible for the highly efﬁciency propulsion and maneuverability.
Hydrostatic pressure under the skin of sharks varies with the swimming speed (Wakling,
2001). The stress in the skin varies with internal pressure and this stress controls skin stiffness.
The inertial pressure on sharks increases tenfold between slow and fast swimming. The skin
acts as an external tendon by transmitting muscular force and displacement to the tail. Hydro-
static pressures of 7 to 14 kN m2 occur just under the skin when swimming slowly and with
bending pressure vary between 20 and 35 kN m2. During bursts of swimming, tighter
bends generate pressures up to 200 kN m2. To bend sharply as in fast swimming the muscles
on one side shorten and increase in cross-sectional area, causing the ﬁbers in the skin overlying
the contracting muscles to increase their angle. The changes in ﬁber angle cause the skin to
remain taut in and avoid wrinkling or loss of tension.
As a variation, some sharks have special arrangements of riblets that converge or diverge in a V
pattern on the skin surrounding the shark’s sensory organs. One set angles in toward the shark’s pit
organ and others angle away from the lateral-line organ. The function of the pit organ is unclear but
the lateral-line organ functions similarly to the human ear (Koeltzsch et al., 2002). It is suspected
that the diverging riblets draw water away from a shark’s ‘‘ears’’ to prevent the noisy sound of
rushing water, which would otherwise inhibit hearing. At the rostrum and on the leading edges of
the ﬁns, the skin is almost totally devoid of riblets. This arrangement promotes smooth water ﬂow to

each side. If the leading edges of the body and ﬁns were covered by the same denticles as the
majority of the body, a swimming shark would deﬂect the boundary layer away from the body and
increase drag. The posterior edges of ﬁns are ﬂexible and denticle-free. This may help to reduce
turbulence, saving energy lost to the vortices occurring immediately behind the ﬁns (Bargar and
Thorson, 1995). Three factors affect the drag reducing properties of riblets, sharp-edged riblets,
riblet protrusion height as there is an optimal height for riblets to protrude into the boundary layer
beyond which they would interfere with the ﬂow of seawater, and the lateral spacing of the riblets to
affect the dynamics of the water passing over the skin (Bechert et al., 1986).
Biomimetics — The structure of shark skin has prompted swimsuit and wetsuit manufacturers
to develop new designs to reduce drag in water to improve times for competitive swimmers or to
improve navigation by scuba divers. Properties of shark skin have also been used as models for
movements of submersible and surface vessels in order to reduce the drag created by the speed
of solid boat structures through water. Finally, aeronautics research has keyed into the structures of
shark skin to reduce air resistance for planes. The human’s body with smooth skin covered with hair
creates a great deal of drag. Speedo, Inc. has developed a swimsuit for competitive swimmers based
on shark skin designs. The Speedo Fastskin FSII suit reduces drag in water by as much as 4%.
Passive drag affects a swimmer in the streamline position, usually after the initial dive into the
water and following a turn. During a 50-m race, a swimmer is likely to be in the streamline position
for up to 15 m. Swimmers from more than 130 countries wore this biomimetic suit at the Sydney
Olympics and over 80% of the swimming medals and 13 out of the 15 world records set were with
swimmers in this new suit. Computational ﬂuid dynamics were used to design the swimsuit which
directs water along grooves in the fabric, allowing the water to swirl in microscopic vortices,
reducing drag. This control of ﬂuid ﬂow creates greater efﬁciency in movement and up to 3%
improvement in overall speed. A similar design could be applicable to wetsuits to reduce transit
time to great depths. Other applications include the design of highly efﬁcient, fast, and maneuver-
able underwater craft, and options for pipes in water distribution systems. Lining a pipe with riblet-
like grooves speeds ﬂow by up to 10% (Koeltzsch et al., 2002).
Interest in these general features has also been seen in the aerospace industry for airplane design.
In 1997, two Airbus Industry A30 planes were designed to test a specially ribbed plastic ﬁlm that
cuts aerodynamic drag when attached to aircraft surfaces and is expected to decrease fuel con-
sumption by 1% (Ball, 1999). The riblets are barely perceptible to the touch, and they appear like a
matte ﬁnish on the aircraft skin. Cathay Paciﬁc and Lufthansa have already begun ﬂying planes with
small percentages of their surfaces covered in riblets to test durability.

Gecko and Burrs — Biological Solutions to Sticking to Surfaces
Background — Gecko lizards do not have little suction cups on their feet but are able to climb
up walls and stick to ceilings. The feet of these animals have toe pads consisting of tiny hair-
like structures called setae, made of keratin (Autumn et al., 2000, 2002). The setae are arranged
in lamellar patterns and each seta has 400 to 1,000 microhair structures, called spatulae. These
tiny structures allow geckos to climb vertical walls or across ceilings. Lizards can cling to
hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces, although adhesion strength is related to the polarity of the
substrate with the more polar the better (Autumn et al., 2002). Setae range from 30 to 130 mm,
and there are 5,000 setae per mm2, thus the total number of setae per gecko foot is greater than
half a million (Autumn et al., 2000). The size of the spatulae that are attached to the setae ranges
from 0.2 to 0.5 mm, distances in which molecular interactions can occur and accounting for van der
Waals interactions (Autumn et al., 2002). The average adhesive force of a seta is ~194 + 25 mN
(Autumn et al., 2000). If the average lizard foot is 100 mm2, the total adhesive force by a lizard is
~400 N. If a human hand were covered in setae, similar to a gecko lizard, the total adhesive
force created from just human hands would be over 30,000 N (equivalent to 6,744 pound-force or
3,059 kg-force).
372
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

Mechanism — Geckos use van der Waal forces to adhere to different surfaces and do not use
secreted sticky materials for this function (Autumn et al., 2002). With such strong adhesive forces
the movement of a lizard could be problematic. However, to ‘‘unstick’’ their feet, lizards curl their
toes. This movement breaks the van der Waal forces and allows movement across substrates. The
critical angle needed to break the forces is 30.68 + 1.8 (Autumn et al., 2000).
Biomimetics — New tapes, similar in design to lizard feet, have been designed and developed as
a dry adhesive to eliminate the sticky residue normally left from more traditional tapes and glues.
The adhesive sticks to most surfaces. Various microﬁbers have been synthesized from polyester,
silicone, and polyimide materials. Their adhesive forces are 294 + 21 nN per spatula, 181 + 9 nN
per spatula, and 70 nN per hair, respectively (Geim et al., 2003). These microﬁbers adhere in a
similar fashion to natural keratinous setae, but after repeated use, the microﬁbers lose their
stickiness due to bunching of the ﬁbers (Geim et al., 2003). Further research studying the traits of
chitin microﬁbers, similar to those found in insects, should help resolve this problem. This type of
Gecko-like adhesive could eventually be used for a wide range of applications, from hanging
tapestries and rock climbing to wound closure in surgery.
14.2.5
Muscles — Efﬁcient Biological Conversion of Chemical Energy into
Mechanical Energy
Background — Muscles are classiﬁed into (a) skeletal — often associated with bone, (b) cardiac —
found in the heart, and (c) smooth — lining of hollow organs in the gastrointestinal, urogenital, and
cardiovascular systems. Skeletal muscle functions in generating force and movement but also in the
support and maintenance of body structure. Cardiac muscle pumps and regulates ﬂow of blood
throughout the body. Smooth muscle contractions function in general housekeeping activities, such
as the movement of food through the gastrointestinal system. The scaling and interactions of
proteins to form contractile muscle systems provide a classic example of the structural hierarchy
in biological materials to achieve remarkable function. Skeletal muscle contains myoﬁbrils which
consist of a series of sarcomeres, the functional units of muscle contraction, composed of contract-
ile proteins, actin, and myosin. The thick myosin and thin actin ﬁlaments are arranged in a repeating
interlocking mesh structure, generating a striated appearance. In addition to contractile proteins,
there are also energy stores and signaling mechanisms associated with the myoﬁbrils.
Mechanism — The mechanism of muscle contraction is based on the crossbridge cycle (sliding
ﬁlament model) and Lymn Taylor actomyosin ATPase hydrolysis kinetic scheme. Myosin consists
of a globular head with ATP and actin binding sites and a long tail that is involved in polymeriza-
tion into myosin ﬁlaments. Actin is polymerized into ﬁlaments and forms the ‘‘ladder’’ along which
the myosin ﬁlament climb to generate motion. Contraction and force generation result from the
shortening of the sarcomere as a result of thin actin ﬁlaments sliding over thick myosin ﬁlaments.
The formation of crossbridges between the ﬁlaments is ATP dependent. In sequence, (a) ATP binds
to myosin, which results in the dissociation of the myosin head, the crossbridge between the
ﬁlaments, from the actin ﬁlament, (b) the free myosin bridge moves into position to reattach to
the actin and ATP is hydrolyzed, (c) the free myosin bridge rebinds to the actin ﬁlament and the
working stroke, and (d) force is generated and the products of ATP hydrolysis are released from the
myosin crossbridge.
Skeletal muscles are attached to two or more bones by tendons. They work in antagonistic
groups such as ﬂexing or bending vs. extending or straightening. Antagonist groups can also
contract together to stabilize joints or maintain body posture. Muscle arrangement is based on the
orientation of the ﬁbers relative to the axis of force generation. The physiological cross-sectional
area (PCSA) of a muscle is the estimated sum of the cross-sectional areas of all the myoﬁbers. The
PCSA is proportional to muscle force generation, increased PCSA results in increased force.
The extent and velocity of muscle contraction increases with myoﬁber length. Two other relation-
ships used to describe muscle properties are based on length–tension and force–velocity. The
Biological Materials in Engineering Mechanisms
373

length–tension relationship illustrates that the isometric tension generated in skeletal muscle is a
function of the magnitude of overlap between actin and myosin ﬁlaments. The greatest force is
generated at an intermediate ‘‘optimal’’ sarcomere length. Long lengths result in decreased myosin
cross-bridges with actin ﬁlaments and short lengths create actin ﬁlament overlaps, which interfere
with crossbridges. Passive tension increases as a muscle is stretched, providing a resistive force in
the absence of muscle activation. The force–velocity relationship demonstrates that the maximum
force generated by a muscle is a function of its velocity and is used to deﬁne the kinetic properties of
the cross-bridge cycle during contraction.
Cardiac muscle has actin and myosin assemblies similar to that of skeletal muscle, but
the muscle cells are mononucleated and arranged in a continuous network of branching and
anastomosing cells. Cardiac muscles maintain constant, continuous contractions to pump blood
throughout the body. Smooth muscles also contain actin and myosin ﬁlaments that produce
contractions but not in a striated pattern. The cells are spindle shaped and mononucleated. Smooth
muscle contractions are slower and can be sustained for longer periods compared with skeletal
muscle. Smooth muscles are responsible for the contractability of hollow organs and have a role
in various functions such as regulating ﬂow through blood vessels. Smooth muscle ﬁbers
are organized into sheets that are arranged into two layers, which alternately contract. The ﬁbers
have a longitudinal arrangement in the outer layer and ﬁbers of the inner layer are organized
in a circular pattern. Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and smooth muscle control is
involuntary.
Biomimetics — Muscles are natural actuators. Actuators are controllable machines that convert
energy to mechanical work by means of a shape or dimensional change. Braided pneumatic muscle
actuators, also known as McKibben artiﬁcial muscles, were ﬁrst developed in the 1950s speciﬁcally
for use in artiﬁcial limbs. The device consists of an expandable ﬁber mesh wrapped around an
inﬂatable bladder. When the bladder is ﬁlled with pressurized air, its volume increases. A muscle-
like contraction is produced as the actuator expands radially while contracting along its axis due to
the constant length of the mesh ﬁbers. Pneumatic muscles produce a large force when shortened and
can achieve greater power or weight ratios than natural muscle. They can operate in antagonistic
modes like natural muscles and are capable of more natural motion and control. The system is
lightweight, adaptable, and easily powered. Pneumatic actuators have high power efﬁciency and are
capable of ampliﬁable force output. Precise control of pneumatic muscles can be difﬁcult because
of their nonlinear and time varying characteristics. Actuator properties can also vary with tempera-
ture and use. Another limitation is that current pneumatic actuators have a short fatigue life in
the order of 10,000 cycles, but a new pneumatic device in which the ﬁber mesh is impregnated
inside the bladder has demonstrated a fatigue life of 10,000,000 cycles. Force output is dependent
on the thickness of the actuator and the speed of the McKibbean muscle is slow relative to natural
muscle response.
Other examples of mimetic structures include shape memory alloys, such as Ni–Ti (Nitinol).
These are a class of metallic materials capable of returning to a predetermined size and shape when
subjected to a thermomechanical load. Macroscopic deformations of the material are caused by
microscopic crystalline structure changes between the hard, high temperature austenite phase and
soft, low temperature martensite phase. Shape memory alloys exhibit typical thermomechanical
properties of psuedoelasticity and shape memory effects. Nitinol wires have been used as artiﬁcial
muscles for robotic and prosthetic applications (De Laurentis and Mavroidis, 2002). Actuation
occurs by a voltage drop across the wire causing current ﬂow through the material, which results in
heating that causes a crystalline transformation and accompanying shape change such as bending.
The advantages of using shape memory alloys are ease of actuation, small size and weight,
noiseless operation, and low cost. Shape memory alloys have high strength to area ratios and are
capable of high grasping strength. Disadvantages include slow response, high power consumption,
dependence of attainable motion and force on wire length and thickness, and heat generation.
Actuation effects are also nonlinear and have short life cycles.
374
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

Electroactive polymers often exhibit the closest performance resemblance to biological muscle.
They are considered to be electrically hard but mechanically soft materials. There are many types of
actuators which fall into this category with varying characteristics and properties. Ionic polymer–
metal composites are capable of large deformations in response to low applied voltage (Jung et al.,
2003). These structures are composed of an ion exchange polymer such as a perﬂuorinated ion
membrane chemically deposited with a metal such as gold or platinum. The metal ions are
dispersed throughout the hydrophilic regions of the polymer. Bending is under the control of
diffusion and Coulomb forces, occurring as a result of mobile ions migrating within the polymer
network due to the application of an electric ﬁeld. These structures do not function in a dry
environment, necessitating a protective coating to retain moisture for function. Electrolysis occurs
at high voltages, which result in degradation of the material and the release of heat and gases,
restricting allowable voltage. Force generation is proportional to the thickness of the material. Ionic
polymer–metal composites have a fast response time, are tough, and can achieve large actuation
strain. They are light, compact, soft, and can be miniaturized. Conducting polymers such as
polypyrrole have been evaluated as artiﬁcial muscles (Otero et al., 1996). Volume changes are
induced by the movement of charge compensating ions to or from the polymer layers during
oxidation and reduction reactions. During oxidation electrons are extracted from the polymer
chains, resulting in the rearrangement of bonds and storage of positive charges. Conformational
movements of the chains in order to maintain electroneutrality generate free volume, which are
occupied by counterions and water molecules from the solution, resulting in swelling of the ﬁlm.
During reduction, these series of events are reversed, promoting shrinkage of the ﬁlm. A polymeric
triple layer muscle made of polypyrrole has demonstrated smooth, uniform movement comparable
to that of natural muscle. In addition to reproducible actuation, the rate and direction of movement
can be controlled by applied current conditions. Polymer actuators exhibit large strain and high
strength, are lightweight, and can operate at room or physiological temperatures. Actuation of
conducting polymers can be achieved at low voltages. Development of conjugated polymer
actuators containing a polymer electrolyte, which functions as the electron source and sink,
between polypyrrole layers has allowed for ‘‘dry’’ actuator function outside of an aqueous solution.
Carbon single-walled nanotube sheets exhibit properties such as mechanical ﬂexibility, high
toughness, and electrochemical behavior that have potential for development as artiﬁcial muscles
(Baughman et al., 1999). Unlike conducting polymers in which actuation is based on
electrochemical dopant intercalation, carbon nantotube actuation results from quantum chemical
and double-layer electrostatic effects. Dimensional changes occur in covalently bonded directions
caused by a double charge injection. Applied voltage change injects an electronic charge into the
carbon nanotube sheet that is compensated at the nanotube electrolyte interface by electrolyte
ions, the double-layer. Carbon nanotube (CNT) actuator sheets are nanoscale actuators that are
organized into nanotube arrays in a manner similar to natural muscle. CNTs exhibit high work
density and good work capacity per cycle. Compared to natural muscle, CNT-actuators are
stronger and more durable. Activation only requires low voltages and the material is capable
of operation at high temperatures. The material is light, shows fast response, has a long life cycle,
and is capable of large displacements. Like most electroactive polymers, actuation requires an
electrolyte solution.
Other examples include vanadium oxides which can be used in various redox-dependent
applications such as the conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy (Gu et al., 2003).
Also, hydrogels are an intermediate between a liquid and solid state, consisting of a polymer
network and interstitial ﬂuid. Gel actuators made of materials such as poly(vinyl alcohol), poly-
acrylonitrile, polyacid acrylic, and polyacrylamide can undergo large volume changes in response
to stimuli such as pH, temperature, or electricity. Bending action can be induced by controlled
swelling. Conformational changes are dependent on the diffusion of solvent through the gel and as a
result of the amorphous nature of many gels, response time can be slow. The size of the gel and
distance for ﬂuid ﬂow are other factors that can affect response time. Hydrogels also tend to lack
Biological Materials in Engineering Mechanisms

mechanical strength or are unable to hold a load. A greater degree of cross-linking would improve
response time and mechanical strength but result in reducing the extent of deformation. Develop-
ment of copolymer gels made of cross-linked hydrogels have resulted in actuators with improved
response time and good mechanical properties (Galaev and Mattiason, 1999). Cross-linked hydro-
gel actuators undergo linear contraction and expansion without volume change, and show faster
response time and improved mechanical strength compared to the individual components (Calvert
and Liu, 1999). Gels require an aqueous environment for operation, so a sealed environment or
coating is required for ‘‘dry’’ operation. Hydrogel actuators are light, compact, and ﬂexible.
A natural polymer hydrogel made of a semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semiIPN) composed
of glutaraldehyde cross-linked chitosan and interpenetrating silk ﬁbroin has demonstrated
reversible swelling–shrinking behavior and may have applications as an artiﬁcial muscle (Chen
et al., 1997).
An emerging area of research has been the development of ‘‘molecular actuators,’’ molecules, or
molecular assemblies that undergo conformational change in response to stimuli and perform work.
Rotaxane is a molecular system that consists of a ring threaded on a rod-like structure with blocking
elements at the ends. The ring shuttles along the rod between two points and can be driven by
chemical, photochemical, or electrochemical forces. A multicomponent rotaxane system consisting
of two string and ring units threaded together that contracts and stretches in response to a metal
exchange reaction has been developed (Collin et al., 2001). The string contains both bidentate and
terdentate ligands and the ring contains a bidentate ligand. This synthetic molecular muscle unit
adopts a stretched conformation in the presence of copper ions, which prefer to bind to two
bidentate ligands. Zinc ions prefer binding to a bidentate and terdentate ligand. When zinc ions
replace the copper, the rings slide along the string from the bidentate ligand to the terdentate ligand,
resulting in a contracted conformation. This synthetic molecule replicates the sliding motion of
natural muscle actin and myosin ﬁlaments.
In addition to the synthetic replication of molecular motors, there has been research into
developing actuators using natural proteins. An artiﬁcial muscle from real muscle components
has been synthesized in vitro (Kakugo et al., 2002). Isolated myosin molecules cross-linked under
stretching showed self-organization capabilities and orientated to form hierarchical structures.
ATPase activity comparable to native myosin was seen in the presence of actin and addition of
ATP resulted in the motion of F-actin along the axis of oriented myosin gel. Actin gels formed from
cross-linked actin–polymer complexes also showed preferential motility on the orientated myosin
gel in the presence of ATP. NonATP based molecular motors have been isolated from sieve
elements of legumes (Knoblauch et al., 2003). The crystalloid protein bodies, dubbed forisomes,
are part of the microﬂuidic system for transport of water and minerals throughout the plant.
Forisomes have a disordered (extended) shape in the absence of calcium ions. In the presence of
calcium ions forisomes take on an ordered (swollen) conformation, acting as a cellular stopcock to
block ﬂuid ﬂow. Isolated forisomes were observed to swell radially and contract longitudinally in
the presence of calcium ions. This anisotropic deformation response was reversible in the absence
of calcium ions and multiple expansion–contraction cycles were induced without causing a
decrease in responsiveness.
Tissue engineering is a means of creating a biological substitute that is capable of restoring,
maintaining, and improving function. Smooth muscle tissue has been successfully engineered
in vitro on tubular scaffolds of poly(lactic-glycolic acid) seeded with bone marrow derived
mesenchymal stem cells (Cho et al., 2004). The differentiated cells exhibited smooth muscle-like
morphology and expressed smooth muscle cell speciﬁc markers, SM a-actin and SM myosin heavy
chain. Bone marrow cells also have the capacity to differentiate into cardiac tissue both in vivo and
in vitro. Stem cells injected into the myocardium develop a cardiomyogenic phenotype and BMSC
transplant experiments have been shown to be effective in treating infarcted myocardium
by generating de novo myocardium (Orlic et al., 2001). Differentiation of stem cells treated with
5-azacytidine, a cytosine analog, that regulates differentiation into cardiomyocytes has also been
376
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

demonstrated in vitro (Makino et al., 1999). The cultured cells beat spontaneously, expressed
cardiomyocyte-speciﬁc genes, and exhibited electrophysiological characteristics similar to in vivo
cardiomyocytes. Another progenitor cell that exhibits developmental plasticity is the hematopoietic
stem cell. Transplanted hematopoietic stem cells have been shown to be involved in skeletal muscle
repair and regeneration (Camargo et al., 2003). However, it is still unclear whether the hemato-
poietic stem cells switches to a myogenic cell fate in response to microenvironmental cues as in the
case of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells or the generation of myogenic cells result
from the fusion of hemopoietic stem cells with the muscle myoﬁbers. In the later case, it is believed
muscle nuclear factors may play a role in activating a myogenic program in the fused hemopoietic
stem cells. A variety of specialized bioreactors have been used to optimize tissue outcomes (Kim
et al., 1998; Carrier et al., 1999; Radisic et al., 2004).
14.3
CONCLUSIONS
The examples provided from Nature illustrate the diverse and functional (high performance)
materials that are available as blueprints for exploitation in the broader ﬁeld of materials science
and engineering. The gap between synthetic and natural polymers in terms of diverse yet controlled
sequence chemistry, coupled with control of regioselective and stereoselective chemical features,
suggests that a signiﬁcant hurdle will remain for some time for synthetic systems to fully emulate
the novel features of natural materials. As control of synthetic processes for polymers continues to
improve, and as models from biology continue to be understood via reverse engineering, more
crossover among these systems will be realized. The marriage of both biological and synthetic
approaches may provide a useful bridge toward the future such that new materials, new processing
paradigms, and new assembly controls can be studied and technologically exploited.

INTRODUCTION: FUNCTIONS OF BIOLOGICAL SURFACES
Biological surfaces represent the interface between living organisms and the environment and serve
many different functions: (1) They delimit dimensions, often give shape to the organism, and
provide mechanical stability to the body. (2) They are barriers against dry, wet, cold, or hot
environments. (3) They take part in respiration and in the transport of diverse secretions, and
serve as a chemical reservoir for the storage of metabolic waste products. (4) A variety of
specialized surface structures are parts of mechano- and chemoreceptors. (5) The coloration and
chemical components of surfaces are important components for thermoregulation, and are often
involved in diverse communication systems. (6) A number of specialized surface structures may
serve a variety of other functions, such as air retention, food grinding, body cleaning, etc.
There are numerous publications describing biological surfaces by the use of light and electron
microscopy. Because of the structural and chemical complexity of biological surfaces, exact
working mechanisms have been clariﬁed only for a few systems. However, biological surfaces
hide a virtually endless potential of technological ideas for the development of new materials and
systems. Because of the broad diversity of functions, inspirations from biological surfaces may be
interesting for a broad range of topics in engineering sciences: adhesion, friction, wear, lubrication,
ﬁltering, sensorics, wetting phenomena, self-cleaning, antifouling, thermoregulation, optics, and so
on. Since all biological surfaces are multifunctional, it makes them even more interesting from the
381

point of view of biomimetics. It is also important to mention here their rather special properties as
living structures, such as growth without interruption of function, ability to adjust to changing
environment, and ability of self-repair. These functions are still unavailable to engineers using
nonliving materials, but clearly represent a challenge for the future developments.
In the present chapter, we discuss some functions of biological surfaces (Figure 15.1) that are
potentially interesting for biomimetics, and demonstrate several examples of materials and systems
that were developed based on inspirations from biology.
15.2
SURFACES OF JOINTS AND SKIN: ANTIFRICTION AND DRAG REDUCTION
One of the challenges in designing moving parts of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) is
fabrication of joints allowing precise motion of parts about one rotational axis or multiple axes. One
problem is the high friction, stiction, and wear rate of joints (Scherge et al., 1999; Komvopoulos,
2003). Wear of the interacting surfaces is a consequence of friction, affecting the material’s
contact points by becoming deformed or being torn away. Friction and wear are strongly correlated
processes by which the points of the surfaces in contact change their topography continuously.
Capillary adhesion, due to the presence of a water layer in contact, can account for a great part of
the measured friction or lead to the stiction between a contact pair (Scherge et al., 1999). These are
critical issues limiting the operational lifetime and negatively inﬂuencing the technological poten-
tial of MEMS. Conventional methods of lubrication cannot always be used, especially in devices
with medical applications. Friction reduction in some man-made mechanical systems is based on
the different hardnesses of elements in contact (Miyoshi, 2001; Li et al., 2004), the use of
hydrophobized surfaces, and the application of surface texture, which minimizes the real contact
area between two solid surfaces. Research on optimization of surface texture has been done using a
‘‘trial and error’’ approach (Scherge and Schaefer, 1998; Etsion, 2004). However, ideas from the
studies of surface properties of biological micro-joints might represent a shortcut towards a
solution.
The biological world is part of the physical world, and therefore, the rules of mechanics also
apply to living systems. Living creatures move on land, in air, and in water. Complex motions
inside their bodies provide ﬂuid circulation or generate forces for locomotion. The resistance
against motion mediated by surrounding media and by the mechanical contact with various
substrates was an evolutionary factor, which contributed to the appearance of many surfaces
adapted to reduce such resistance. But, one always needs friction to generate force to move on a
substrate or to overcome the drag caused by friction elsewhere. A living motion system becomes
optimized when it is capable of minimizing friction at one end of the system while maximizing it at
the other end (Radhakrishnan, 1998). In other words, a living device needs a combination of

maximum friction required for acceleration, deceleration, and maneuvering combined with min-
imum friction in joints for economic energy expenditure. Adhesion phenomena can also contribute
to the functionality of such a system.
Vertebrate bones, that are joined with each other, are covered by cartilage, which is the gliding
surface of the joint. The coefﬁcient of friction is very low (0.0026) (Fung, 1981). Cartilage is a
ﬁbrous composite material of collagen ﬁbers embedded in a highly hydrated proteoglycan gel
(Buckwalter, 1983; Aspden, 1994). The so-called white ﬁbro-cartilage is responsible for joint
mobility. It provides lubrication of surfaces in contact (Ateshian, 1997) and serves as a kind of
damper under dynamic loads. Four theories explaining the cartilage lubrication mechanism have
been previously reviewed. These are ﬂuid transport theory, lubrication layer theory, roller-bearing
theory, and cartilage material theory (Fung, 1981; Scherge and Gorb, 2001). In insect joints, which
work under lower loading forces, but much higher frequencies than vertebrate joints (Wootton and
Newman, 1979; Gronenberg, 1996), the joint surfaces are usually smooth or present a combination
of wavy and smooth counterparts (Figure 15.2). Underlying tissues are penetrated with canals,
which are presumably responsible for delivering lubricants in the contact area. The specialized
surface structures in the insect joints have been shown to confer friction-reducing properties in
certain insect surfaces (Perez Goodwyn and Gorb, 2004). The next step is to transfer the structural
and functional solutions found in biological joints to industrial systems.
Evolutionary processes have adapted swimming and ﬂying organisms to interact efﬁciently with
the surrounding medium. Reduction of drag due to friction in the boundary-layer close to the body
surface is one of these adaptations. Skin secretion (mucus), compliant material of skin, scales,
riblets and the degree of roughness may inﬂuence the ﬂow velocity gradient, the type of ﬂow, and
the thickness of the boundary-layer around animals, and may seriously affect their drag in a positive
or negative way. Boundary-layer damping results from a combination of elastic and viscoelastic
structures in the skin of some animals. Dolphin skin has a very special design (Nachtigall, 1977). It
is very smooth and relatively soft. Under the pressure of microturbulence, the rubber-like outer

layer deforms and changes the local shape of the skin surface due to a shift of the damping ﬂuid
located under the rubber-like layer. Such a material design seems to be able to damp turbulences.
Many ﬁsh have developed another mechanism to reduce friction (by up to 60% in some species)
in the boundary-layer. They produce skin secretions, which are usually slightly soluble in water. In
areas, where microturbulence is strong, these substances can be locally dissolved. This results in the
damping of microturbulence (Nachtigall, 1977). Due to skin secretions, ﬁsh can reach an extremely
high speed in a short time.
In aquatic vertebrates, skin, specialized for increased friction, often contains patterns with
microridges and micro-outgrowths (Fahrenbach and Knutson, 1975). Friction in the boundary-
layer of the body moving in the medium at high Reynolds numbers may be decreased due to such a
sculpturing of the surface. The grooved scales of the shark skin is an example of such a system.
Their size ranges from 200 to 500 mm. The surface of each scale contains parallel grooves between
so-called riblets directed almost parallel to the longitudinal body axis. Interestingly, grooves and
riblets of neighboring scales correspond exactly to each other so that the shark surface looks like a
pattern of parallel stripes (Reif and Dinkelacker, 1982). Experiments on ﬂow resistance have been
carried out with smooth-bodied models and with those covered with grooves of dimensions similar
to original shark skin. The ﬂow resistance measured in the grooved model was about 5 to 10% lower
than the resistance in the smooth model at a Reynolds number of 1.5  106. The geometry of the
grooves and riblets can also inﬂuence results. Small bristles, scales, and microtrichia of the wings of
ﬂying insects (Bocharova-Messner and Dmitriev, 1984; D’Andrea and Carﬁ, 1988) have similar
function (Figure 15.3). The microturbulences, generated around such structures in ﬂight, presum-
ably build a kind of a lubricating layer of air between an air stream and the insect surface. This can
possibly decrease friction during high-speed ﬂight. A foil covered by tiny riblet-like structures,
inspired by biological surfaces, has been suggested for aeroplane surfaces (Bechert et al., 2000).
Terrestrial animals, such as snakes, must overcome problems related to friction in contact with
solid or friable media. Friction-modifying nanostructures of the scaly surface of snakes have
recently been described (Hazel et al., 1999). These include an ordered microstructure array (Figure
15.4), presumably to achieve adaptable friction characteristics. Signiﬁcant reduction of adhesive
forces in the contact areas caused by the double-ridge microﬁbrillar geometry provides ideal
conditions for sliding in a forward direction with minimum adhesive forces. Low surface adhesion
in these local contact points may reduce local wear and skin contamination by environmental
debris. The highly asymmetric proﬁle of the microﬁbrillar ending with a radius of curvature of 20 to
40 nm may induce friction anisotropy along the longitudinal body axis and functions as a kind of
stopper for backward motion, while providing low friction for forward motion. Additionally, the
system of micropores penetrating the snakeskin may serve as a delivery system for a lubrication or
anti-adhesive lipid mixture that provides boundary lubrication of the skin.
15.3
ATTACHMENT SYSTEMS
Materials and systems preventing the separation of two surfaces may be deﬁned as adhesives. There
are a variety of natural attachment devices based on entirely mechanical principles, while others
additionally rely on the chemistry of polymers and colloids (Gorb, 2001; Scherge and Gorb, 2001;
Habenicht, 2002). There are at least three reasons for using adhesives: (1) they join dissimilar
materials; (2) they show improved stress distribution in the joint; and (3) they increase design
ﬂexibility (Waite, 1983). These reasons are relevant both to the evolution of natural attachment
systems and to the design of man-made joining materials.
In general, adhesive-bond formation consists of two phases: contact formation and generation of
intrinsic adhesion forces across the joint (Naldrett, 1992). The action of the adhesive can be
supported by mechanical interlocking between irregularities of the surfaces in contact. Increased
surface roughness usually results in an increased strength of the adhesive joint, due to the increased
384

contact area between the contacting surfaces and the adhesive substance. Strong adhesion is also
possible between two ideally smooth surfaces. If sufﬁcient contact between the substrate and
adhesive interface is reached, forces will be set up between atoms and molecules of both contacting
materials, and they will adhere. Van der Waals forces are the most common of such forces, together
with the hydrogen bond. Electrostatic forces may be also involved. However, for typical biological
adhesion, their contribution is not signiﬁcant.
Adhesive organs, which may be used for attachment to substrates as well as being involved in
catching prey, demonstrate a huge diversity among living organisms due to their structural and
chemical properties. Biological adhesion underlies the organization of all living tissues. Cell
contact phenomena have been extensively reviewed in the biomedical and biophysical literature
(Weiss, 1970; Steinberg, 1996; Strange, 1997). The function of attachment appeared very early in
evolution; early unicellular organisms have a variety of cellular adaptations for adhesion. Many
multicellular organisms often bear adhesive organs composed of single cells. In many cases,
however, cells are specialized into glands, which may be composed of several cell types.
Attachment devices are functional systems, the purpose of which is either temporary or
permanent, attachment of an organism to the substrate surface of another organism or temporary
interconnection of body parts within an organism. Their design varies enormously and is subject to

different functional loads (Nachtigall, 1974; Gorb, 2001). There is no doubt that many functional
solutions have evolved independently in different lineages. Many species of animals and plants are
supplied with diverse attachment devices, the morphology depending on the species biology and the
particular function in which the attachment device is involved. Evolutionary background and
behaviour inﬂuence the speciﬁc composition of attachment systems in each particular species.
There are eight fundamental classes of attachment principles: (1) hooks, (2) lock or snap, (3) clamp,
(4) spacer, (5) suction, (6) expansion anchor, (7) adhesive secretions (glue), and (8) friction (Gorb,
2001). However, different combinations of these principles also occur in existing attachment
structures. Three types of adhesion at the organism level are known: (1) temporary adhesion
allowing an organism to attach strongly to the substrate and detach quickly when necessary (see
below the subsection about locomotory attachment devices); (2) transitory adhesion permitting
simultaneous attachment and movement along the substrate; (3) permanent adhesion involving the
secretion of a cement. These three types of adhesion do not have the same purpose and use different
adhesive systems.
The industry of adhesives presently follows three main goals (Hennemann, 2000): (1) an
increase in the reliability of glued contact; (2) mimicking of natural, environment-friendly glues;
(3) development of mechanisms for application of a minute amount of glue to the surface. An
additional challenge is the use of substances or mechanisms which allow multiple attachment and
detachment, and enable attachment to a variety of surfaces.
Many biological attachment devices correspond to some of these requirements. One such
example is the hairy surface of the leg pulvillus in ﬂies. This system uses a secretion enabling
hairs to attach and detach to diverse substrata very quickly. The hair design includes a mechanism
that delivers the secretion, in extremely small amounts, directly to the contact area, and only then
when contact to the substrate is achieved (Figure 15.5).
Walking machines usually use suckers to hold onto vertical and overhanging surfaces. A primary
disadvantage of this attachment principle is that a very smooth substrate surface is required. The
future goal should be to make robots that are able to walk on a variety of surfaces. Insects can walk
rather well on smooth and structured substrata, on inclines, vertical surfaces, and some of them even
on the ceiling.
In their evolution, animals have developed two distinctly different mechanisms to attach
themselves to a variety of substrates: with smooth pads or with setose, or hairy surfaces. Due to
Figure 15.4

386

the ﬂexibility of the material of the attachment structures, both mechanisms can maximize the
possible contact area with the substrate, regardless of their microsculpture (Figure 15.6a,b,e,f).
Tenent setae are relatively soft structures (Figure 15.6c,d). In Calliphora ﬂies, their tips are usually
compressed, widened, and bent at an angle of 608 to the hair shaft (Bauchhenss and Renner, 1977).
When walking on smooth surfaces, these hairs in ﬂies and beetles produce a secretion, which is
essential for attachment (Ishii, 1987; Gorb, 1998).
Different forces may contribute to the resulting attachment force: capillary adhesion and
intermolecular van der Waals forces. Geckos, which possess hairy attachment system, do not
produce any secretory ﬂuid in contact area. Different authors have carried out force measurements
of gecko attachment system, at the global and local scales, and found evidences for contribution of
both van der Waals and capillary forces, generated by the layer of absorbed water, to the overall
adhesion (Hiller, 1968; Autumn et al., 2000; Autumn and Peattie, 2002; Huber et al., 2005). The
action of intermolecular forces is possible only at very close contact between surfaces. The forces
increase, when the contacting surfaces slide against each other. This may explain, why ﬂies placed
on a smooth undersurface always move their legs in a lateral–medial direction (Wigglesworth,
1987; Niederegger and Gorb, 2003). During these movements, pulvilli slide over the surface
obtaining optimal contact. A contribution of intermolecular interaction to the overall adhesion
has been shown in experiments on the adherence of beetles (Stork, 1980) and beetle setae (Stork,
1983) on a glass surface. The presence of claws, decrease of air pressure, decrease of relative
humidity, or electrostatic forces do not inﬂuence beetle attachment on the smooth substrata. In the
beetle Chrysolina polita (Chrysomelidae), the resulting attachment force directly depends on the
number of single hairs contacting the surface. Recently, the contribution of intermolecular inter-
action and capillary force has been demonstrated for the ﬂy, Calliphora vicina, in a nanoscale
experiment with the use of atomic force microscopy (Langer et al., 2004). Smooth systems are
composed of cuticles of unusual design (Figure 15.6g,h). The key property of smooth attachment
devices is deformability and the softness of the pad material. Viscoelastic properties have recently
been demonstrated (Gorb et al., 2000; Jiao et al., 1999).

Hairy and smooth leg attachment pads are promising candidates for biomimetics of robot soles
adapted for locomotion. Similar principles can be applied to the design of microgripper mechan-
isms with an ability to adapt to a variety of surface proﬁles. Most recent data on hairy systems
demonstrated their excellent adhesion and high reliability of contact. In contrast to smooth systems,
some hairy systems seem to operate with dry adhesion, and do not require supplementary ﬂuids in
the contact area. Contacting surfaces in such devices are subdivided into patterns of micro or
nanostructures with a high aspect ratio (setae, hairs, pins). The size of single points gets smaller and
their density higher as the body mass increases (Scherge and Gorb, 2001). We have explained this
general trend by applying the Johnson-Kendall, Roberts (JKR) contact theory, according to which
splitting up the contact into ﬁner subcontacts increases adhesion (Arzt et al., 2003). The funda-
mental importance of contact splitting for adhesion on smooth and rough substrata has been
explained by a very small effective elastic modulus of the ﬁbre array (Persson, 2003). Adhesion
enhancement by division of the contact area has also been demonstrated experimentally (Peres-
sadko and Gorb, 2004). A patterned surface, made out of polyvinylsiloxane (PVS), has signiﬁcantly
higher adhesion on a glass surface than a smooth sample made out of the same material (Figure
15.7). This effect is even more pronounced on curved substrata. An additional advantage of
patterned surfaces is the reliability of contact on various surface proﬁles and the increased tolerance
to defects of individual contacts.
Recently, Continental has developed a winter tyre with honeycomb proﬁles similar to those
existing on the attachment pads of the grasshopper Tettigonia viridissima (Gorb et al., 2000)

and tree frogs (Hanna and Barnes, 1990) (Figure 15.8a–d). The company promises enhanced wear
performance on dry roads, less aquaplaning and better braking on wet roads, substantially improved
lateral guidance, better grip, and more traction on ice. Fine grooves and longitudinal sipes in the
individual tread blocks, provide lateral guidance. These are intersected by lateral sipes that provide
maximum traction. This optimization ensures maximum safety on wintry roads. As lateral forces
are generated in bends, the honeycomb sipes provide more gripping edges than conventional sipes,
thus considerably improving trackholding when cornering (Barnes et al., 2002) (Figure 15.8e).
15.4
ANTI-ADHESIVE AND SELF-CLEANING SURFACES
Some biological systems have developed surfaces covered with micro and nanostructures, having
antiwetting, anti-adhesive, and self-cleaning properties. The most prominent example is the so-
called lotus-effect recently described for plant surfaces and successfully applied in numerous
industrial materials, such as paints, roof tiles, spoons, and sinks.
The majority of surfaces of vascular plants are covered by a hydrophobic cuticle, which has an
external layer consisting of so-called epicuticular waxes. The layer often contains wax crystalloids,
with dimensions ranging from hundreds of nanometers to micrometers (Figure 15.9). The roughness
of the hydrophobic plant surface decreases wettability (Holloway, 1969a,b, 1994), which is reﬂected
in a greater contact-angle of water droplets on such surfaces, compared to smooth surfaces of the
same chemical composition. This property of structured hydrophobic plant surfaces results in their
ability to be cleaned by rolling drops of water (Barthlott and Neinhuis, 1997, 1998). Particles
contaminating plant surfaces consist, in most cases, of material that is more readily wetted than
hydrophobic wax components. Contaminants usually rest on the tips of the surface structures, so that
the real contact area between the particles and plant surface is minimized. Thus, these particles can
be easily removed by water droplets rolling over the surface. In this case, adhesion between particles
and water droplets is greater than between particles and plant surfaces due to the reduced contact
between the particles and plant surfaces. In the case of a smooth plant surface, the real contact
area between the contaminating particles and the surface is large enough to avoid particle adherence

to rolling water droplets. A series of experiments revealed that surfaces of such plants as Nelumbo,
Colocasia, and Brassica are richly covered by wax crystallites, which are responsible for the
cleaning effect of their surfaces (Barthlott and Neinhuis, 1997). Similar adaptations have also
been described for animal surfaces. Wings of insects (Odonata, Ephemeroptera, and Neuroptera)
are covered with wax crystallites with dimensions that are comparable to those found in plants.
These surfaces have been experimentally proven to be extremely nonwettable (Wagner et al., 1996).
Wax crystalloids on the ﬂowering shoots of plants, such as Salix spp, Hypenia, and Eriope are
adaptations to prevent crawling insects from robbing nectar and other resources (Eigenbrode,
1996). The wax blooms of ant-plants from the genus Macaranga seem to be an ecological isolation
mechanism for the symbiotic ants. This mechanism is based exclusively on the inﬂuence of the ant
attachment abilities, but not on the repellent effects of the wax. The comparison of surfaces in
different species of the Macaranga revealed a high correspondence between the occurrence of wax
coverage and obligatory ant associations (Federle et al., 1997). To explain the anti-adhesive
properties of plant surfaces covered with waxes, several hypotheses are proposed: the roughness-
hypothesis, the contamination-hypothesis, the wax-dissolving-hypothesis, and the ﬂuid-absorption-
hypothesis (Gorb and Gorb, 2002).
Many aquatic and semiaquatic arthropods have sculptured surfaces involved in holding air
underwater for respiration. Such surfaces, called plastrons usually contain ﬁelds of microtrichia
(Heckmann, 1983). These structures appear convergently in various arthropod taxa, as an adapta-
tion to aquatic environments: Collembola, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Diptera, Araneae,
and Diplopoda (Thorpe and Crisp, 1947; Hinton, 1976; Messner, 1988). Some terrestrial insects,
such as Aphididae (Auchenorrhyncha), also bear similar structures in the form of bristles, mush-
room-like spines, or stigmal plates, which can protect their surfaces from moisture (Heie, 1987). In
water striders and some spiders, antiwetting surfaces of legs and ventral body side are involved in
the locomotion mechanism of walking on the water surface (Figure 15.3i,j).
15.5
OPTICS
Structural coloration, due to the presence of scales and bristles, is well-known in insects such as
butterﬂies (Ghiradella, 1989) and beetles (Schultz and Hadley, 1987). For example, scales of the
scarabaeid beetles from the genus Hoplia bear additional microtrichia on their surfaces responsible

for lustreless appearance of the elytra surface (Figure 15.3c,d). The coloration pattern serves for
species and sex recognition, and also for camouﬂage and mimicry. The most interesting type of
structural coloration is called iridescence, which is well known in insects and birds, and has been
characterized for many different species (Ghiradella et al., 1972; Huxley, 1975). The iridescence is
a result of optical interference within multilayer structures (Ghiradella, 1991) which are rather
complex in their architecture (Figure 15.10) and may be incorporated into systems that can produce
several different optical effects. Such effects include diffraction-assisted reﬂection angle broad-
ening (Vukusic et al., 1999, 2000a), all-structural color mixing and strong polarization effects
(Vukusic et al., 2000b).
Another interesting optical property of surface structures has been described from the eye
surface of insects. Ommatidial gratings are antireﬂective structures on the eyes of insects, espe-
cially those which are nocturnally active (Figure 15.3b). These protuberances are very small
microtrichia (200 nm in diameter), which increase visual efﬁciency through decreased surface
reﬂection in their density, and increased photon capture for a given stimulus condition (Parker et al.,
1998; Vukusic and Sambles, 2003). Such a grating is particularly useful on a curved corneal
surface, as it would increase the transmission of incident light through the cornea, compared with
a smooth surface. For an increase in transmission and reduced reﬂection, a continuous matching of
the refractive index n1 and n2 at the boundary of both adjacent materials is very critical. If the
periodicity l1 of the grating is smaller than wavelength l2 of transmitting light, only light of zero
order can be reﬂected or transmitted. For a constant ratio of both materials (cuticle-air) at the
boundary between media, the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength of incoming light is nearly constant
(Bernhard et al., 1965). This region, therefore, can be considered as homogenous and an effective
refractive index can be given. Such structured surfaces may also be self-cleaning utilizing the lotus-
effect mechanism described above.
15.6
THERMOREGULATION AND PREVENTION OF DRYING
Surface outgrowths may provide multi-level reﬂection of sunlight. Such an ability of wing scales is
suggested to be an adaptation for cooling in butterﬂies (Grodnicky, 1988). Body coverage by
bristles, scales, and hairs in the honey-bee, Apis mellifera, may be used for warming up and
inﬂuencing metabolism at low temperatures (Southwick, 1985). In species of curculionid beetles
of the genus Tychius inhabiting arid areas, cuticular scales have been suggested to be a system

wing scales.

responsible for maintaining thermal balance (Karasev, 1989). An additional function of such
coverage is preventing water loss. This function was suggested for leaf-like bristles at the body
margins in Aphididae (Auchenorrhyncha) (Heie, 1987). Surfaces of desert plants are covered with
hydrophobic wax-crystalloids decreasing water loss through the cuticle.
15.7
SOUND GENERATION
Highly specialized areas of cuticle, responsible for sound generation, usually consist of patterns of
cuticular plates, seldom of microtrichia ﬁelds (Hinton, 1970). When these surfaces slide over each
other, sound is generated. Such structures have been previously described from elytra, abdomina,
and coxae in phylogenetically distantly related arthropod taxa: spiders (Aranei), crustaceans
Trizopagurus, bugs Cimicomorpha, Pentatomorpha, and beetles Geotrupes (Scarabaeoidea)
(Gogala, 1984; Starck, 1985; Field et al., 1987; Palestrini et al., 1987). The sound frequency
corresponds to the periodicity of these structures contacting functionally corresponding surfaces,
and the speed of sliding. These systems should be very wear-resistant. However, rigorous experi-
ments supporting or rejecting this statement are absent in the literature.
15.8
DEFENSE, GROOMING, SAMPLING, FILTRATING, GRINDING
Long, stiff, sclerotized cuticular spines are often used as defense mechanisms against predators.
These structures are particularly widespread in the marine arthropods, such as zoea of crabs
(Morgan, 1989). A similar function was described for long setae of certain beetle larvae from the
family Dermestidae (Nutting, 1963).
Grooming is a very important function for insects, which sometimes live in extremely dirty or
dusty environments. Their rich sensory equipment has to be kept clean in order to respond adequately
to external signals. Many Hymenoptera bear modiﬁed leg spines specialized for the cleaning of
antennae (Scho¨nitzer and Lawitzky, 1987; Francouer and Loiselle, 1988). In aquatic environments,
the problem of grooming is even more important because of biofouling. Pinnoterid crabs (Decapoda,
Brachiura) use epipodite lobes covered by bristles for cleaning the gills (Pohle, 1989).
The collection of pollen grains and food sampling are functionally similar to grooming. They
require similar surface structures and similar motorics. In bees (Apoidea), systems responsible for
collecting pollen grains are usually equipped with urticating bristles (Pasteels and Pasteels, 1972;
Hesse, 1981). Mouthpart surfaces used for scratching food particles from substrates appeared
independently in the evolution of such phylogenetically far-related animal groups as insects (Figure
15.3h), crustaceans, molluscs and even some vertebrates (Arens, 1989). When food is sampled
from rough hard substrata, surfaces of sampling devices show traces of wear. Cuticular protuber-
ances that grind food items occur not only in the insect mouthparts, but also in one part of the
insect digestive system, called the proventriculus. Specialized spines on the inner surface of
the proventriculus have been reported in insects (Richards and Richards, 1969). Similar teeth are
found in crustacean stomachs.
Filtration systems are usually equipped with long bristles too. Such systems are well-known
from mouthparts of aquatic insect larvae. The ﬁltering system of insect spiracles that keeps the
tracheae free of dirt particles is composed of branched acanthae (Figure 15.3g). However, in some
cases, completely different principles may be involved in the design of these systems. The labellum
of many ﬂies (Brachycera, Diptera) bears so-called pseudotracheae (Gracham-Smith, 1930; Elzinga
and Broce, 1986). Outgrowths of the pseudotracheae have a complex material design. Labellum and
pseudotracheae are driven by muscles, resilin springs, and hydraulic pressure, which enable a
change in the diameter of the ﬁltration sieve, depending on the size of the particles in the food
(Figure 15.3f).

BIOMIMETICS OF SURFACES: WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM EVOLUTION?
Throughout evolution, nature has constantly been called upon to act as an engineer in solving
surface-related technical problems. Organisms have evolved an immense variety of shapes and
structures. Although often intricate and fragile, they can nonetheless deal with extreme mechanical
loads. This chapter has demonstrated that many functions are based on a variety of ingenious
surface-related solutions. The success of biologically inspired technological surfaces is an indica-
tion that knowledge from biology is also highly relevant for technical applications.
One of the greatest challenges for today’s engineering science is miniaturization. Many organ-
isms have solved many problems correlated with extremely small size, during their evolution.
Zoologists and botanists have collected a huge amount of information about the structure of such
living micromechanical systems. This information can be utilized to mimic them for further
industrial developments. An important feature of the evolution of functional surfaces is the multiple
origins of similar solutions in different lineages of living organisms, and in different functional
systems. For example, there is no doubt that attachment systems consisting of a pair of microtrichia-
covered surfaces appeared independently in the head-arresting system of Odonata, coxal-locking
devices of Neuroptera, and the elytra-locking system of Coleoptera (Gorb, 1999, 2001). In the case
of locomotory attachment devices, hairy pads appeared three times independently within insects
and additionally at least two times within other animals (Gorb and Beutel, 2001). Also, similar
optical structures, made of different materials, have been described for insects, birds, and plants
(Vukusic and Sambles, 2003). Such examples of convergence are the most interesting from the
engineering point of view, because they indicate a kind of optimal solution for a particular problem.
These examples should be the very ﬁrst candidates for biomimetics.
An engineering approach, applied after detailed studies on the natural system, involving
modeling and then prototyping, would be most promising. However, in some cases, engineers
can also, simply copy the surface shape and replicate it at a variety of scales and materials using
available technologies of chemistry and processing. Both approaches may run parallel for some
time and possibly converge later.

REVIEW OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF SYSTEM CONTROL
From the micro-level of molecular biochemical reactions to the macro-level of ecosystems, control
exists everywhere in complex biological systems. System control engineering, which is strongly
motivated by mimicking biological systems, affects powerfully the late development of overall
engineering ﬁelds including bioengineering. Recent rapid development of biological science and
technologies will further improve the active applications of control engineering. Meanwhile,
system control theory itself will also be promoted by advanced biomimetic researches.
The aim of system control engineering is to abstract the essences of control existing in
biological and physical systems of nature and to apply them to create artiﬁcial systems. In 1948,
N. Wiener published his book Cybernetics, in which he deﬁned cybernetics as the science that deals
with the control and communication of systems that have an organized structure (Wiener, 1948). By
considering the similarity between control in biological systems and in artiﬁcial systems, he tried to
399

unify the interpretation of living organisms and machines from the viewpoint of organized systems.
Several theoretical concepts have been evolved in control theory, typiﬁed by feedback control,
optimal control, sequence control, and so on. The main roles of feedback control are regulation
and adjustment, whereas optimal control involves planning and supervision with a higher level
of control state than feedback control. Sequence control, on the other hand, has the objective of
rationalizing logical procedures, scheduling, and decision.
Basically, the objective of feedback control is to follow up a desired command input (set point)
by controlled variables subjected to unpredictable external disturbance. For the constant set point,
the control problem is referred to as a constant value control (regulator problem), and if the
command changes over time, it is referred to as a follow-up control (servomechanism problem).
The linear feedback control theory using transfer functions has already reached its maturity in the
1940s. The similarity of biological and mechanical systems in terms of homeostasis was considered
within the framework of feedback control in that time. For example, tremor can be seen in many
neurological disorders, their hand trembles when they attempt to grasp an object. Some tremors
may be related to feedback instabilities. Since the feedback control is used to suppress disturbances
and to maintain a set point in constant value control, it corresponds to homeostasis in living
organisms.
In the 1960s, modern control theory based on the foundation of state space methods has been
established. This leads to the rapid appearance and development of the pole assignment principle,
observer theory, optimal regulator, Kalman ﬁlter, the internal model principle, and their extension
to multiple-input–multiple-output systems. While the modern control theory contributed to the
reﬁnement of the linear feedback theory, an even more important development was the clariﬁcation
of the principles related to duality of control and observation. Speciﬁcally, Kalman (1960)
introduced the concepts of controllability and observability and demonstrated the duality of control
and observation for the linear systems. He showed that it is possible to construct the pole-
assignment of a closed-loop system and the state-estimation of a controlled system in the same
framework. Furthermore, optimal regulator and Kalman ﬁlter can also be constructed in the
same way. Therefore, if a system (the controlled system) is controllable and observable, then it is
possible to construct any kind of desired dynamics (poles) for a closed-loop system.
Although the similarity of biological and mechanical systems was studied in terms of feedback
control, often the subject was limited to the range in the vicinity of operating point in which the
linear theory holds. In the 1980s, the control design theory has returned to the frequency response
methods and robust control theories based on H1 norm were developed (Doyle et al., 1989). H1
control theory makes it possible to quantitatively handle the inﬂuence from the variations of the
controlled object’s dynamic characteristics, which had been previously treated only qualitatively.
However, the control concept remains unchanged within feedback control.
On the other hand, adaptive control is a more direct strategy than robust control to handle
the inﬂuence of the object’s variations. In robust control, the controller itself does not change
even if the controlled object was ﬂuctuated. However, adaptive control has the function of
identiﬁcation to monitor the ﬂuctuation in the controlled object, and based on the result of
identiﬁcation, the controller is adjusted. Accordingly, identiﬁcation and adjustment are the two
basic functions of adaptive control. Recently, robust adaptive control has also been developed
to increase the system’s robustness against the ﬂuctuations of the controlled object. Adaptive
control system can be regarded as a nonlinear system in the sense that the compensation is adjusted.
However, since the controlled system and the compensation element are simply linear, and the
purposes of the control are still limited to suppress disturbances and to track command input as in
feedback control, present adaptive control does not have the ability to self-organize the system’s
internal states with respect to the environmental dynamic variations as seen in biological systems. It
left far from the goal of automatic system control design. The meaning of adaptation in the adaptive
control systems that has been developed so far is still quite different from the one featured in living
systems.

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

System control is not simply limited to regulation or adjustment as that in the feedback control,
it also includes management. In the 1960s, system optimization was extensively discussed in
modern control theory. This brought forth the optimal control theory typiﬁed by Pontryagin’s
maximum principle (Boltyanski et al., 1960) and Bellman’s dynamic programming (Bellman and
Kalaba, 1960). Optimal control is related to the optimization of a dynamic system while the theory
to optimize a static system is referred to as optimalizing control. Both concepts correspond to
planning and management or supervision. They are different from regulation. An example of
optimal control problem is a terminal control problem, such as to design trajectories of a rocket
to send a satellite accurately onto a preprogrammed orbit. This can be regarded as the problem of
obtaining a desired command input for a follow-up control in the feedback control problem.
Therefore, it is recognized that this control strategy is on the planning level, which is generally
one level higher than the strategy of feedback control. Mathematically, Pontryagin’s maximum
principle and Bellman’s dynamic programming can be regarded as an extension of the classical
calculus of variations to control problems, that is, the Hamilton’s canonical equations and the
Hamilton–Jacobi formula. On the other hand, optimalizing control optimizes a performance
function by considering only the static input–output relationship in steady state as opposed to
optimizing dynamic processes in optimal control. In early 1951, Draper and Li ﬁrst considered
the optimalizing control problem in order to keep the internal combustion engine running at an
optimum operating condition regardless of variations in load (Draper and Li, 1951). Recent
electronic fuel injection (EFI) system, in which a microprocessor adjusts the air–fuel ratio, has
replaced the carburetor in some automobiles. Although it was not exactly what Draper and Li
intended to do, optimalizing control has been implemented in various ﬁelds. In this way, optimaliz-
ing control determines the optimum set point (i.e., target value) of the constant value control, it can
also be regarded as an upper level above feedback control.
Though half a century has passed since Wiener’s Cybernetics, machines are not even close to
resembling animals and their abilities. When we dreamed of ﬂying like a bird, the airplane was
born, far outdoing the birds in speed and size. However, the airplane cannot realize the bird’s agility
to move from branch to branch. The same thing can be found for the present robots and computers.
Nowadays, industrial robots can only perform predeﬁned operations in a well-structured task space
but do not have full capability to deal with unexpected situations in natural complex environment.
An autonomous robot, which is able to identify its own environment and determine its own
voluntary actions, is yet something of the future. Similarly, though the computer has increased
enormous computational capabilities, it is nevertheless a serial sequential machine that can perform
only preprogrammed actions. Therefore, although machines have been made to imitate and to
amplify special functions of human and animals, they are far from achieving the level of the
autonomy, ﬂexibility, environmental adaptability, and functional variety of biological systems.
Recently, as marked by the rapid spread of computers, internet, and mobile communication, the
developments of the information science and technologies make it possible for us to process higher
capacity of information much faster and more intelligently in the worldwide scale. It provides us
with enormous challenging realms. Meanwhile, the systems around us are becoming larger and
more complex. It becomes more and more important for the artiﬁcial systems to have high
ﬂexibility, diversity, reliability, and afﬁnity. System control theory, which forms the core founda-
tion for understanding, designing, and operating of systems, is still limited and insufﬁcient to
handle complex large-scale systems and to process spatial temporal information in real time as
biological systems. Under this background, biomimetic and biologically inspired control research
is becoming a very important subject. This subject is widely expected to breakthrough the next
information and system control theories.
Animals acquire and develop their extremely sophisticated movement through active interaction
with the environment using parallel decentralized processing of spatial temporal information in real
time. They also use logical recognition together with dynamic physical motion. The analysis
and clariﬁcation of these functions mathematically at the system level, and imitation of them in

401

engineering, will lead to a deeper understanding of ourselves and will be signiﬁcant for constructing
the next generation of advanced artiﬁcial systems such as human friendly robots.
The following sections of this chapter will introduce the recent biomimetic system control
researches. From the point of view of the system’s self-organization, we will describe in Section
16.2 the nonlinear and redundant sensory-motor learning problem. We will introduce the problem
of optimal motion formation under environmental constrains in Section 16.3. In Section 16.4, we
will study the system’s mechanical interaction and environmental adaptation, and show a novel
biologically inspired two degree of freedom adaptive control theory with its application to a robot’s
force tracking control. The conclusion will be given in Section 16.5.
16.2
SENSORY-MOTOR ORGANIZATION
Animals survive in complex natural environment using their sensory-motor behavior. The organ-
ization and development of brain nervous system’s motor control functions largely depend on the
physical interaction with the external environment. Self-organization of the environmental adaptive
motor function is one of the most interesting characteristics that we should learn in biomimetic
control research.
Charles T. Snowdon, who was a President of the Animal Behavior Society, described animal’s
behavior as follows: ‘‘Animal behavior is the bridge between the molecular and physiological
aspects of biology and the ecological. Behavior is the link between organisms and environment, and
between the nervous system and the ecosystem. Behavior is one of the most important properties
of animal life. Behavior plays a critical role in biological adaptations. Behavior is how we humans
deﬁne our own lives. Behavior is that part of an organism by which it interacts with its environment.
Behavior is as much a part of an organisms as its coat, wings, etc. The beauty of an animal includes
its behavioral attributes’’ (Snowdon).
Historically, there are two broad approaches to studying animal behaviors: (1) ethological
approach and (2) experimental physiological approach (http://salmon.psy.plym.ac.uk/). Ethologists
mainly concern with the problems of how to identify and describe species-speciﬁc behaviors.
They try to understand the evolutionary pathway through which the genetic basis for the
behavior came about. They use ﬁeld experiments and make observations of animal behavior
under natural conditions. On the other hand, behaviorists and comparative psychologists concen-
trate on how we learn new behaviors by using statistical methods and carefully controlled
experimental variables for a restricted number of species, principally rats and pigeons, under
laboratory conditions.
The famous Russian physiologist Pavlov, who is recognized as the founder of behaviorism,
trained a dog by ringing a bell before mealtime. Through the course of time, he discovered that
simply by ringing the bell, the dog would salivate. It is now known as the concept of conditioned
reﬂex (Pavlov, 1923). A similar conceptual approach was also developed by him to study human
behavior. Sherrington, on the other hand, studied spinal reﬂexes and gave out his theory of the
reciprocal innervation of agonist and antagonist skeletal muscle innervation, which is known as
Sherrington’s Law (Sherrington, 1906). Bernstein, another Russian scientist, further pointed out
different important problems in motor learning and organization. Dealing with the redundancy
problem in motor behavior, he proposed the concept of synergy in muscles’ coordinative actions so
as to constraint the motion D.O.F. with respect to the required tasks. He suggested that it is such a
synergy that results in the reﬂex motions between each D.O.F. Moreover, this synergy changes with
respect to the environmental variations, which is beyond the philosophy of Pavlov’s conditioned
reﬂex (Bernstein, 1967).
Today, with the development of information science, robotics, and control engineering, it
becomes easier to study the motor behaviors and the principal control mechanisms of the brain
nervous system more quantitatively and systematically.

16.2.1
Nonlinear and Redundant Sensory-Motor Organization
Even simple reaching movements that can be performed by a 5-month-old baby are never simple in
cybernetics. At least, it requires solving several nonlinear coordination transformations from the
object space to the muscle space. The transformations may also contain the problem of redundancy.
Figure 16.1 shows a 3D computer simulation model of whole body dynamic musculo-skeletal
system of human developed in RIKEN BMC. As seen from this model, in order to realize the
natural human motions, it is necessary to control more than 105 D.O.F by over 300 muscles. Figure
16.2 shows another research example on how to control the 3 D.O.F. position of an object by whole
arm cooperative manipulation under the inﬂuence from the external forces. Here, each arm has 4
D.O.F. and interacts with the object by all links not the end-effectors. Human body is such a super-
redundant system, and the redundancy exists in a lot of levels of the motor coordinates. The inverse
solution of the redundancy problem generally forms a solution manifold in the motor control space,
the solution is not unique and thus is not easy to deﬁne. Therefore, although the redundant D.O.F.
provides the biological system with powerful hardware foundation to realize various smooth and
delicate motions that have high tolerance (fault-tolerance to the functional disability in some
parts of the system) and adaptability (adapt to the environmental uncertainties, variations, and
different objectives), in order to enjoy these beneﬁts, during organizing the sensory-motor coord-
ination, we have to overcome the ill-posed nonlinear problems. These problems come not only from
the kinematics but also from the dynamics. By now, there are many researches proposed from the
viewpoints of robotic engineering as well as biologically inspired learning theory. The proposed
approaches can be largely summarized as: (1) learning approach based on neural network; and (2)
Jacobian approach from robotic engineering.

16.2.2
Motor Learning Using Neural Network
In the learning-based approach, the main efforts have been made through: (1) supervised learning;
and (2) self-organization.
Fundamentally, supervised learning depends closely on the availability of an external teacher. In
this approach, we ﬁrst construct a neural network and deﬁne a smooth nonlinear function for a set of
neurons. Then, for a given set of inputs, we use the error between the desired response from the
teacher and the network’s actual output to adjust the interconnection weights between each neuron.
Researches of supervised learning resulted in the later biological discovery of long-term depression
(LTD) in cerebellum (Rosenblatt, 1962; Ito, 1984), which in turn clariﬁed one of the basic functions
of cerebellum in motor learning and adaptation. However, the later developments of supervised
learning in artiﬁcial neural network may not match in detail with the real neural networks
(Rumelhart et al., 1986).
One of the important abilities of supervised learning is the so-called generality, which means
that, after sufﬁcient learning, for a new input that was not learned before, the network can generate
proper output. It is proved for the multi-layered artiﬁcial neural networks that, with sufﬁcient
numbers of neurons in the hidden layer, the network can approximate any continuous mapping from
input to output (Funahashi, 1989). For motor learning, however, the condition of sufﬁcient learning
indicates that we have to perform sufﬁcient physical trial motions by the body. This is necessary in
supervised learning but is not efﬁcient for motor learning in biological systems. For motor learning,
the main target is rather to realize the generality of motion with limited physical trials.
By modifying the supervised learning, three models: (1) direct inverse (Kuperstein, 1988); (2)
distal supervised learning (Jordan and Rumelhart, 1992); and (3) feedback error learning (Kawato
et al., 1987; Miyamoto et al., 1988) have been proposed for the speciﬁc problem of motor learning.
The main considerations of the modiﬁcations are about the selection of the suitable teacher signal
and the concave property of the nonlinear transformation. However, these three models have two
common disadvantages derived more or less from supervised learning. Firstly, in applying an
algorithm such as backpropagation, global information of the network’s output error is used to
adjust all weights between nerve cells. It requires massive connections among all neurons, which is
difﬁcult to realize artiﬁcially. Secondly, the resultant motor output may not have topology con-
serving property with respect to the sensory input, or even no spatial optimality as we will show in
the next subsection. Because of these disadvantages, in the tasks such as to move the hand smoothly
in the task space, there may exist a dramatic change in the joint angles (Guez and Ahmad, 1988;
Gorinevsky, 1993).

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

Comparing with supervised learning, the self-organization approach does not depend on
any external teacher. It focuses on the spatial order of the input data and organizes the learning
system so that the neighbor nodes have the similar outputs (Amari, 1980; Kohonen, 1982). By
considering spatial characteristics of motor learning, self-organization algorithm has also been
extended to generate the topology conserving sensory-motor map (Ritter et al., 1989). In this
approach, we ﬁrst construct a three-dimensional lattice, and specify the sensory input vectors, the
corresponding inverse Jacobian matrixes, and the joint angle vectors to each node within the lattice.
The lattice then outputs desired joint angles for the arm to perform many physical trial motions. For
each trial motion, a visual system is used to input the end-effector position of the arm in the task
space. The algorithm is then used to search for a winner node with its sensory vector closest to the
visual input. After that, the sensory vector, the inverse Jacobian matrix as well as the joint angle
vector of the winner node, together with that in its neighbor nodes, are adjusted, respectively. The
neighbor region of adjustment decreases as the learning proceeds. As a result, the vectors (or a
matrix) in one node are similar to that of its neighbor nodes. That is, a topology conserving map is
self-organized without any supervisor’s command. In this algorithm, for every adjustment step, the
arm has to perform the real physical trial motions. Since it is still within the learning process,
sometimes these trial motions are dangerous or may be impossible due to the incorrectness of the
map. In addition, both in searching the winner node as well as when adjusting the neighbor nodes,
the approach requires a centralized gating network to interact with all nodes, which makes the
learning algorithm centralized and not parallel as seen from the computation point of view. Finally,
besides the fact of topology conserving, we could not obtain any information about the map’s
spatial optimality.
16.2.3
Diffusion-Based Learning
Researches on motor learning of biological system are not limited to the two learning approaches
in above subsection. In order to overcome their drawbacks, we presented a diffusion-based motor
learning approach, in which each neuron only interacts with its neighbor neurons and generates a
sensory-motor map with some spatial optimality.
In detail, we consider the spatial optimality of the coordination: to minimize the motor control
error of the system as well as the differentiation of the motor control with respect to the sensory
input overall the bounded task space. By using variational calculus, we derive a partial differential
equation (PDE) of the motor control with respect to the task space. The equation includes a
diffusion term. For the given boundary conditions and the initial conditions, this PDE can be solved
uniquely and the solution is a well-coordinated map (Luo and Ito, 1998).
From the motor learning point of view, our approach contains both the aspects of supervised
learning and self-organization. Firstly, we assumed that the forward many-to-one relation from the
hand system’s motor control to the task space sensory input can be obtained using supervised
learning, and at the boundary, the supervisor can provide correct motor teacher information. Then,
by evolving the diffusion equation, we can obtain the sensory-motor coordination overall the
bounded task space.
16.2.3.1 Robotic Researches of Kinematic Redundancy
Before describing diffusion-based learning, we ﬁrst brieﬂy review the redundancy problem
and summarize previous robotic approaches. Without losing generality, we only consider the
kinematic nonlinear relation between the work space and the joint space which is represented as
x ¼ f(u)
(16:1)

where u ¼ u1, u2, . . . , um

T, x ¼ x1, x2, . . . , xn

T, m > n, and
dx ¼ J du
(16:2)
where J is a n  m matrix. As shown in Figure 16.3, the range and null spaces of J are
R(J) ¼
˙x 2 Rn: ˙x ¼ J(u) _uu for 8 _u 2 Rm


, N(J) ¼
_u 2 Rm: J(u) _u ¼ 0


(16:3)
and dim R(J) þ dim N(J) ¼ m.
Assuming the Jacobian J is known, we summarize ﬁve typical inverse kinematics approaches:
1.
By using the transpose of the matrix J, we calculate
_u ¼ JT(xd  x)
(16:4)
where xd is the desired end-effector position (Chiacchio et al., 1991).
2.
For the case when rank (J) ¼ n, we use Jþ, the pseudo-inverse of J, to obtain
_u ¼ Jþ˙x
or
_u ¼ Jþ˙x þ (I  JþJ)h
(16:5)
where JJþ ¼ I and vector (I  JþJ)h 2 N(J). When rank(J(u)) < n, then J is singular, the joint u is
the singular conﬁguration (Klein and Huang, 1983).
3.
By specifying additional task constraints to extend J as a full rank square matrix Je, we have
(Baillieul, 1985)
_u ¼ J1

4.
The regularization method to minimize the cost function k dx  Jdu k þl k du k.
5.
Based on compliance control, by using the relations:
t ¼ Ku du , F ¼ Kx dx;
and
t ¼ JTF;
dx ¼ J du
(16:7)
then we have Ku ¼ JTKx J; and therefore du ¼ (JTKxJ)1JTKx dx.
In approach 3, the speciﬁcation of the additional task constraints may be closely related to the
Bernstein’s concept of synergy. However, from the biological point of view, the main problem
inherent in all the above approaches is the assumption that the system’s Jacobian is known
a priori, which seems unlikely in biological system. In addition, the cost functions and task

constraints considered in some of these approaches may not really be applied by the biological
system. There are also several drawbacks such as: (1) all approaches need numerous computation
of the Jacobian matrix and/or its pseudo-inverse; (2) the approaches 2 and 3 may be numerically
unstable; and (3) the so-called quasicyclic problem (Lee and Kil, 1994). Therefore, research
on how the biological system organizes its sensory-motor coordination should reﬂect not only
the mathematical aspects of the algorithm and its computational efﬁciency, but also the bio-
logical reality.
16.2.3.2 Diffusion-Based Learning Algorithm
Consider again the nonlinear and redundant relation represented by an unknown function
x ¼ g(y);
x 2 Rn,
y 2 Rm, m $ n
(16:8)
We try to obtain the inverse y ¼ g1(x) that minimizes a spatial criterion in a bounded task space:
V(y) ¼ 1

(16:9)
where a(t) and b(t) are two adjustment coefﬁcients, and A is the inverse Jacobian that will be
mentioned later. Using variational method, it can be proved that the optimal solution of the inverse
y ¼ g1(x) follows the PDE:
@y
@t ¼ a(t)r2y þ b(t)A[x  g(y)]

This PDE has two terms. The ﬁrst term is a diffusion term that has the effect to interpolate the
solutions of the y in the task space x, while the second term acts for reducing the position errors. The
discrete version of the equation is

where t is the evolution step, (i, j) are position in task space. As shown in Figure 16.4, ytþ1

adjusted by its four neighbor sides. Here, in order to represent all conﬁgurations of a 3 D.O.F. robot
reaching its end-effector to all discrete positions of the x space, we reduce the scale of the robot and
shift its origin to each discrete points of x.
One of the main points in this approach is how to set the adjustment coefﬁcients a(t) and b(t) in
the learning process. In our study, in order to learn the inverse Jacobian matrix A, we set the time
functions a(t) and b(t), so that b(t) ¼ 1  a(t). For example, initially we select coefﬁcients a ¼ 1
and b ¼ 1 for only diffusion, after that, set a ¼ 0 and b ¼ 1 for error correction. Therefore, during
the diffusion process, the inverse matrix A can be obtained by

Note that, for the step 1, since x ¼ g(y) is a function from high to lower dimension, it is possible to
learn it using the general supervised learning. If we already learned the system’s forward relation in
step 1, then during performing the learning steps of 5 and 6, the motor system is not necessary to
perform the physical trial motions. Figure 16.5 shows the resultant map for a three-link robot arm
using above learning approach. It is clear that the arm not only reaches its desired positions in all of
the task space, but also the joints change smoothly with respect to the change of the arm’s end-
effector.
This approach has three advantages:
1.
It does not require too many trial motions for the sensory-motor system.
2.
During the map formation process, it requires only the local interactions between each node.
3.
It guarantees the ﬁnal map’s spatial optimality overall the bounded task space.
The detailed proof of the above diffusion-based learning algorithm using variational technique is
given in Luo and Ito (1998).
It should be noted that the redundancy considered here only involves the kinematic aspect. For
the redundancy problem considering the system’s dynamics, refer to Arimoto’s recent research
(Arimoto, 2004).

16.2.3.3 Diffusion-Based Generalization of Optimal Control
Diffusion-based learning can also be effectively applied to generalize an optimal control for a robot
manipulator (Luo et al., 2001).
Generally, in optimal control we have to solve a two-point boundary value problem with respect
to increase and decrease of time. However, it is very difﬁcult to solve it analytically, especially for a
nonlinear system like a robot.
By now, there are many numerical approaches to solving the optimal control problem for a
given set of initial and terminal conditions. However, these approaches require enormous
computations. For every change in the initial and terminal conditions, they have to perform the
complex computation again, which make it difﬁcult to realize the optimal control for the robot in
real time.
In our approach, we assume that, for some initial and terminal conditions, we already obtained
the optimal solutions. Then, by using the diffusion-based learning algorithm, these optimal solu-
tions can be generalized overall the bounded task space. For example, as shown in Figure 16.6, we
assume that if for the initial S and four terminal conditions of T1 to T4, the optimal control inputs

different conﬁgurations. For the smooth change of the end-effector’s position, the robot’s joint angles are also

are already obtained, then, by using diffusion-based algorithm, we can obtain all semioptimal
control solutions for all the initial and terminal conditions within a bounded work space as shown in
Figure 16.7 without solving the nonlinear two-point boundary value problem.
Our approach greatly reduces the computational cost. In addition, since the diffusion-based
learning process is completely parallel distributed, it only requires local interaction between the
nodes of a learning network (a lattice) and therefore can be realized by the modern integrated circuit
technology easily.
Recent neuron scientiﬁc discoveries show that, nitric oxide (NO), a gas that diffuses between
neuron cells locally, can modulate the local synaptic plasticity and thus plays an important rule in
motor learning and generalization (Yanagihara and Kondo, 1996). We expect that our diffusion-
based learning theory may provide some mathematical understanding of the function of NO in the
neural information processing and motor learning.
16.3
OPTIMAL MOTION FORMATION
In the previous section, we described on how to solve the sensory-motor organization from the
redundant sensory space input to the motor control output. In this section, we consider the optimal
motion formation problem for the arm to move from one position to another in the task space.
16.3.1
Optimal Free Motion Formation
For a simple human arm’s point-to-point (PTP) reaching movement in free motion space, it is found
experimentally that the path of human arm tends to be straight, and the velocity proﬁle of the arm
trajectory is smooth and bell-shaped (Morasso, 1981; Abend et al., 1982). These invariant features
give us hints about the internal representation of motor control in the central nervous system (CNS).
One of the main approaches adopted in computational neuroscience is to account for these
invariant features via optimization theory. Speciﬁcally, Flash and Hogan (1985) proposed the
minimum jerk criterion

value problems.

Uno et al., on the other hand, proposed to take into account about the arm’s dynamics as a

is presented (Uno et al., 1989a), which implies that human implicitly plans the PTP reaching
movements in the human body space based on the arm’s dynamic model. Here t is the combined
vector of the joint torques. They also expanded this model to a muscle model (Uno et al., 1989b)
and proposed the minimum muscle force change criterion to show that CNS may generate unique
hand trajectory by minimizing a global performance criterion of

Kawato et al. also presented a cascade neural network model that may be possible for the
nervous system to solve such a minimizing torque–change problem (Kawato et al., 1987; Miyamoto
et al., 1988).
16.3.2
Optimal Motion Formation under Environmental Constraints
Studies of above section considered only the simple PTP human arm movements in the free motion
space. However, how about the optimal criterion for the more complex constraint motions such as
opening a door, turning a steering wheel, rotating a coffee mill, et al.?
To ask this question, we performed experiments of crank rotation task. As shown in Figure 16.8,
rotating a crank requires only one degree of freedom force, however, we have to deﬁne the torques
for the two joints of the arm. This is also a force redundant problem.
At the same time, we have performed many optimum calculations for the different kinds of
criterions including the minimum jerk, minimum torque change, the minimum muscle force
change, the minimum end-effector’s interaction force change as well as our proposed criterion
to minimize the combination of end-effector’s interaction force change and muscle force change.

tasks.

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

Compared with the experimental result of the measured force shown in Figure 16.9(a), the
computational results for the cases of the minimum muscle force change criterion and the combin-
ation of the hand interaction force change and muscle force change criterion are, respectively,
shown in Figure 16.9(b) and (c) (Ohta et al., 2004).
From Figure 16.9, it is observed that the predicted numerical result of the contact force vectors
when using the minimum muscle force change criterion (which was proposed for P.T.P. motion in
the free motion space) is inadequate here. Instead, the human arm tends to minimize
J ¼
ðTf
0
( _FT _F þ w_fT_f)dt
the combination of the hand interaction force F change and the muscle force f change as in
Figure 16.9(c) and Figure 16.10. Therefore, we strongly suggest that human arm movement is
realized by different optimal criterions according to different task conditions as well as task
requirements.
The combined criterion also captures well the muscle activities in the constrained multi-joint
motions. It covers both the motions in the free motion space and the constrained motion space, since
in the free motion space the interaction force at the end-effector is zero. Therefore, the combined
criterion reduces merely to the minimum muscle force change criterion in the free motion space.
How can the central nervous system measure the hand contact force and how can it solve the
optimal constraint dynamic motion control are left as open questions.
16.4
MECHANICAL INTERACTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL ADAPTATION
This section further goes to describe the motor control functions on the mechanical interaction with
dynamic environment. It is well known that human can perform physical interactions with uncertain
dynamic environment skillfully. In fact, through force feedback from tendon and the co-activation
of antagonist muscles, human can control the arm’s mechanical impedance adaptively with respect
to the environmental dynamics so as to realize the desired time response of the motion as well as the
contact force (Hogan, 1984).
In order to realize such adaptive motor functions by a robot, we should not only search for the
soft artiﬁcial actuators such as biological muscles, but also discover the control principles of the
motor functions. Technically, according to the task requirements, the contact tasks can be speciﬁed

into two classes: those that require compliant interaction with the environment such as to push and
open a door, and those that require to impose some exact force to the environment. With respect to
these two different contact requirements, impedance control and explicit force control have been
proposed, respectively. In this section, we summarize these two control approaches and introduce
their recent developments.

16.4.1
Impedance Control
Let us formulate a robot’s dynamic equation in contact task space as
IrðxÞx:: þ Crðx, ˙xÞ˙x ¼ ur  f
(16:18)
where Ir x
ð Þ is the robot’s inertia matrix, cr x,˙x
ð
Þ˙x is the centrifugal and Coriolis force vector,
respectively. ur is the robot’s control input vector and f is the contact force from the environment.
For simplicity, let us consider the environmental dynamics as
Mex:: þ De˙x þ Kex ¼ f
(16:19)
where Me, De, and Ke are the environmental inertia, viscosity, and stiffness, respectively, and is
assumed unknown. It is well known that by specifying nonlinear compensation of
ur ¼ f þ M1
r Ir(x)[u  Dr˙x  krx] þ cr(x,˙x)˙x
(16:20)
the robot’s dynamics becomes
Mrx:: þ Dr˙x þ Krx ¼ u  f
(16:21)
where Mr, Dr, and Kr are the robot’s inertia, viscosity, and stiffness, respectively, and u(t) is a new
control input of the robot that we should design late.
In impedance control, we usually control the robot’s position and use the force feedback to
adjust the robot’s mechanical impedance as seen from the environment so as to keep a compliant
contact with the environment (Hogan, 1985; Luo and Ito, 1993).
In detail, the control input is designed as
u ¼ Cxðxd  xÞ þ Cff
so that the robot dynamics as seen from the environment be as
Mrdx þ Drd˙x þ Krdðx  xdÞ ¼ f
where Cx and Cf are the robot’s position and force feedback controllers, respectively.
From the stability point of view, we usually require the robot to be passive with respect to the
environmental interactions. Passivity is deﬁned as the property that the system does not ﬂow energy
to outside. The robot’s passivity as seen from its environment or the manipulated object is very
useful for the stable and safely mechanical interaction. When applying impedance control, if the
desired position xd is constant, then the robot is passive. However, if the xd changes with respect to
time, then the robot may lose the passivity as seen from the environment.
Inorder fortherobot torealizethe passivity while performingthetimevarying interactions,Li and
Horowitz(1999)proposedapassivevelocityﬁeldcontrol(PVFC),theyalsosuggestedtoapplyPVFC
to control a human interactive robot and smart exercise machines. Unlike the passivity based control
scheme by Slotine and Li (1991), in which they considered the passivity of a tracking error system,
PVFC remains passive of the robot with respect to the external environment by adding a virtual
ﬂywheel to exchange the mechanical energy with the real robot. However, PVFC has the following
two main problems. Firstly, when specifying desired velocity vector ﬁeld, PVFC does not consider
theuncertaintiesoftheenvironmentalgeometricconstraints.Secondly,althoughPVFC maintainsthe
Biomimetic and Biologically Inspired Control
415

passivity, the contact task performance cannot be adjusted with respect to the environment dynamics.
In most contact tasks, we do not know the environmental constraints before performing the tasks;
speciﬁcally,its shape,size,location aswell asits mechanical dynamics.Therefore, the environmental
uncertainties will inﬂuence the robot’s task performance even using PVFC.
Mussa-Ivaldi et al., on the other hand, investigated the organization of motor output of
spinally dissected frogs. They stimulated the spinal cord with microelectrodes and observed
isometric forces produced by the muscles of the legs. It is reported that, elicited by a single
stimulation, the ankle position converges to a single equilibrium point of a force vector ﬁeld,
and the point of convergence is shifted by superposing several vector ﬁelds resulting from
multiple stimulations (Mussa-Ivaldi and Gister, 1992). Inspired by the biological studies on
primitive motor behavior, we proposed an adaptive PVFC approach where learning of the unknown
environmental geometry is based on the vector ﬁeld interpolation theory (Luo et al., 1995;
Saitoh et al., 2004). In our approach, we ﬁrst parameterize the desired velocity vector ﬁeld by the
weighted combination of a set of basis vector ﬁelds according to the environmental model. Then, in
order to overcome the inﬂuences from the model uncertainties of the environment, we use force
feedback to adjust the weight parameters of the desired velocity ﬁeld for the robot to approach the
real environment.
For the dynamic environment, in order to maintain the passivity of the impedance control with
time varying impedance center, a sufﬁcient condition to adjust the impedance center is derived as
follows (Kishi et al., 2003).
Theorem: Deﬁne V(x) as the robot’s desired velocity vector of impedance center in the task space
without considering the environment uncertainties, ˙x0 ¼ aV(x); the adjustable robot impedance
center, where a is an adjustment parameter. For a given constant r > 0, if we adjust

then the impedance controlled robot with time varying impedance center remains passive with
respect to the supply rate ˙xTf for any initial SO > 0 and any velocity vector V(x). Where

and

x is the robot’s position and f is contact force between the robot and its environment.
16.4.2
Force Control
Here we consider another contact task requirement to realize a speciﬁc desired interaction force to
the environment at the end-effector of a robot manipulator as shown in Figure 16.11.
For above robot’s dynamics (16.18), the basic control objective considered here is to design the
robot’s control input ur such that the robot realizes the desired contact force fd.
By Equations (16.19) and (16.21), the force controlled object from u to f becomes
P(s) ¼ [I þ E(s)R(s)]1E(s)R(s)
(16:22)
which includes the robot dynamics R(s) ¼ [Mrs2 þ Drs þ Kr1 and the dynamic environment
E(s) ¼ Mes2 þ Des þ Ke, P(s) is usually assumed to be biproper.
416
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

By now, there are many approaches to designing the force control loop. Among them, the
simplest one is the constant feedforward þ PI feedback control
u(t) ¼ fd þ KP(fd  f(t)) þ KI
ðt
0
(fd  f(t))dt
(16:23)
that uses the force feedback error to generate the control input (Raibert and Craig, 1981). However,
since the feedback control always has loop delay, the robot is impossible to realize the exact force
tracking.
In what follows, we simply consider the scalar case and introduce a recent two D.O.F. adaptive
tracking control theory. We then study its application to the robot force tracking control. We will
show by computer simulations and experiments that, if we perform this adaptive control for the
complex time varying force reference (we call it a PE condition and will explain it later), then after
the adaptation process, the robot can realize exact force tracking without any loop delay.
16.4.2.1 Two D.O.F. Adaptive Tracking Control
Referenced from the biomimetic research of biological motor control functions of brain, Ito and
Kawato proposed a feedback error learning approach to show that brain may learn the inverse
dynamics model of the controlled object within the cerebellum, and uses this model in the
feedforward loop so as to realize exactly tracking of the desired motions (Ito, 1984; Miyamoto,
et al., 1988). Artiﬁcial neural network was also applied to learn the inverse dynamics model.
Inspired by these biomimetic studies of the feedback error learning, Miyamura et al. (2002)
proposed a two D.O.F. adaptive control limited to linear systems. By assuming that the controlled
plant is biproper together with a condition on the strictly positive realness of a speciﬁc transfer
function (see Miyamura and Kimura, 2002 for the details), they proposed an adaptation algorithm
and proved its convergence. However, since the speciﬁc transfer function in their condition
contains both the feedback controller and the unknown parameters in the inverse model, the strictly
positive realness condition requires a high gain in the feedback controller with respect to the
unknown parameters of the inverse model. This makes it difﬁcult to design the feedback controller
in advance. To overcome this problem, Muramatsu and Watanabe (2004) proposed a new two
D.O.F. adaptation algorithm without the assumption on the strictly positive realness condition.
Here, we brieﬂy introduce this algorithm.

Interaction between a robot and its unknown dynamic environment.

As shown in Figure 16.12, P is an unknown transfer function from the control input u(t) to the
control output f(t), K, and Q(u) are the feedback and feedforward controllers, respectively,
with the adjustable parameter u. P is assumed unknown and is stable and has stable inverse.
The objective here is not only limited to the convergence of the control error e(t) ! 0 as in
the previous adaptive control or learning control researches, but also to realize the inverse of P by
Q(u). It is clear that, once Q(u) ! P1, then the control system can track any other types of desired
signals without any loop delay. The only condition here is to perform an adaptation process with
respect to a desired input that satisﬁes a PE condition that will be explained later in the theorem.

Finally, to derive an adaptive rule, let us deﬁne
^u(t): ¼ uT(t)~j(t)
(16:36)

Substituting Equations (16.32) and (16.36) into (16.37), the signal «(t) is transformed to
«(t) ¼ ufb(t) þ c(t)Tje(t) þ k(t)e(t)
(16:39)
Using these signals, we have then the following two D.O.F. adaptive control theorem:
Theorem: For the force controlled object P(s) with its unknown inverse dynamics given as (16.24)–
(16.26), if we adjust the parameter of the feedforward controller (16.28)–(16.30) as
du(t)
dt
¼ a~j(t) ufb(t) þ c(t)Tje(t) þ k(t)e(t)


(16:40)
then the force control error e(t) ! 0. In addition, if ~j(t) satisﬁes the PE condition such that ~j(t)~j(t)T
be positive, then the feedforward controller Q(u) described by (16.28)–(16.30) tends to P1
The detailed prove of this theorem is given in Muramatsu and Watanabe (2004).
The adaptation law (16.40) can be interpreted as a combination of the feedback error learning
and the learning control, since u(t) is adjusted by both the feedback input ufb(t) and the feedback
error e(t). In addition, je(t) is also generated by e(t).
Note that the convergence of Q(u) ! P1 means that we can realize the time response f(t) exactly
as the desired fd(t) without any feedback loop delay. However, in order to realize this convergence, it
is necessary for the desired fd(t) to satisfy the PE condition during adaptation process.
The convergence of adaptation can be increased further by the following modiﬁcation:
d u(t)
dt
¼ G~j«(t)
and
dG
dt ¼ G~j~jTG
(16:41)
instead of Equation (16.40).
16.4.2.2 Application to a Robot’s Force Tracking Control
To evaluate the effectiveness of above two D.O.F. adaptive tracking control, we performed
computer simulations and robotic experiments.
In the simulations, as shown in Figure 16.13, we set the robot’s parameters as mr ¼ 1, dr ¼ 2, and
kr ¼ 0.5; and the unknown dynamic environmental parameters as me ¼ 1, de ¼ 2, and kr ¼ 2,
respectively, at the beginning of the simulation. The simulation results are given in Figure 16.14,
where Figure 16.14(a) shows the result for the adaptation law (16.40), and (b) is the fast conver-
gence result when using (16.41). We change the environmental viscosity from de ¼ 2 to 0.5 at the
simulation time t ¼ 250[s] in Figure 16.14(a) and at t ¼ 15[s] in (b). In order for the feedforward
controller (Q(u) in Figure 16.12) to converge to the inverse of the force controlled object
P(s) ¼
mes2 þ des þ ke
(me þ mr)s2 þ (de þ dr)s þ (ke þ kr) ,
we set the desired force fd(t) as noise at the beginning 100[s] and during the time of 250[s] to 350[s]
in Figure 16.14(a) and at the beginning 4[s] in (b).
In both cases, since the force tracking error converged very fast, it is hard to distinguish between
the desired and the reaction forces in these ﬁgures. Figure 16.14 also shows that the unknown
parameters of the robot and environment are converged to the real parameters, which means that
the feedforward compensation realizes the exact inverse of the force controlled object P(s).
Therefore, even for the rectangle type of desired forces, the control system can realize exactly
420
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

the same reaction force. It is also clear that when the environment changes its dynamics (at
simulation time t = 250[s] in Figure 16.14(a) or t = 15[s] in (b)), only if the desired forces satisfy
the PE condition, we can obtain the new inverse of the force controlled object. Therefore, the
adaptation (16.40) or (16.41) has the so-called generality as we discussed in the learning theory of
artiﬁcial neural networks.

Experiments of the robot force tracking control are also performed on the robot system shown
in Figure 16.11. The two-link robot is ﬁrstly controlled using a high gain position feedback so that it
can only move along the force control direction. The environment is set as a second-order mass-
spring-damper system as that in Figure 16.13.
Figure 16.15(a) shows the time response of the reaction force when using the usual constant
feedforward þ PI control as in Equation (16.23), while (b) is the result of the two D.O.F. adaptive
tracking control that uses the same PI feedback controller as in (a) but the feedforward controller of
(16.28)–(16.30) and (16.33) with the adaptation law (16.41). The matrices F and g in (16.28),
(16.29), and (16.33) are set as

:
Technically, in order to overcome the inﬂuence of force measurement noise in the experiments, we
simply choice to stop the adaptation if the signal «(t) in Equation (16.41) is small.
From the experiments, it is clear that the adaptive tacking control approach can lead to better
tracking performance with almost no transitional delay, even if we change the desired force to the
sine wave (at the time 30[s] in the experiments here).
16.5
CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER RESEARCHES
Traditional biomimetic researches mainly abstract the speciﬁc functions of speciﬁc biological
systems under speciﬁc environmental conditions. As a result, many artiﬁcial systems such as
airplanes, computers as well as present robots were generated. These efforts not only realized but
also greatly improved the speciﬁc functions within artiﬁcial systems, sometimes far beyond the
biological systems. However, as seen from the system ﬂexibility, diversity, and the environmental
adaptability, there still exists too large a gap between the biological and artiﬁcial systems. This
gap exists not only at the material levels such as muscle and skeletal structures but also at system
control level.

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

In this chapter, we have introduced some of the recent researches from the point of view of
biomimetic control. Especially we have concentrated our discussions on how to organize the system
redundancy, the optimal motion formation, and the environmental adaptive control.
There are also many other issues, such as autonomous decentralized system control and
hybrid system control, that is not mentioned here but are basically important in biomimetic
control.
An autonomous decentralized system is a system in which the functional order of the entire
system is generated by cooperative interactions among its subsystems (Yuasa and Ito, 1990). Each
subsystem has the autonomy to control a part of states of the system. It is well known that biological
systems possess this autonomous decentralized characteristic. For example, animal movements are
generated by the cooperation of many motor neurons. These motor neurons control muscular ﬁbers
to generate different movements. Rhythmic movements, such as walking, ﬂying and swimming, are
generated by the control from the mutually coupled endogenous neural oscillators. The rhythmic
moving patterns can be changed with respect to the environmental conditions as well as various
objectives. The walking movement of a cat is a typical example. Here, the periodic motions of each
limb cooperate with each other to generate stable gait patterns. As the cat moves faster, the gait
pattern changes from ‘‘walk’’ to ‘‘trot,’’ and ﬁnally to ‘‘gallop.’’ Although the gait changes
discontinuously, the speed of the body movement varies continuously. This pattern switching
behavior can be formulated based on the bifurcation theory of nonlinear dynamic systems. In
addition, the graph structure of the interaction network between all subsystems and the time delay
of the interactions are important to determine the over system’s performance such as synchroniza-
tion (Wu and Chua, 2002; Amano et al., 2004).
On the other hand, if the system contains both continuous time-driven and discrete event-driven
dynamics, it is called a hybrid system. Human brain has a high ability to mix discrete logical
thinking with dynamic body movements control simultaneously. It realizes the diversity of the
movements with respect to the environmental conditions as well as task requirements. The
biological research on basal ganglia suggests that such kind of a skillful optimal motion pattern
scheduling function is generated through the interaction between the basal ganglia and the
high level motor cortex (Hikosaka et al., 1996). Nowadays, hybrid system arises in a large
number of application areas. However, the problem of the hybrid system is inherently difﬁcult
because of its combinatorial nature. A straightforward application of the available frameworks
faces the limitation of computational complexity and lacks the theoretical prediction of system
properties. Hybrid systems can be formulated by many kinds of models, such as piecewise
afﬁne (PWA) system, linear complementary (LC) system, and mixed logical dynamical (MLD),
system, etc. The equivalence between each model formulation was studied. For the MLD system,
several powerful mixed integer quadric programming (MIQP) algorithms have been proposed to
solve the on-line optimization procedures (Bemporad, 1999). In robotic applications, recently,
modeling and control of dexterous multi-ﬁngered hand operations and multi-legged dynamic
walking movements are studied from the hybrid system point of view (Yin et al., 2003). But still
few theoretic results have been achieved, and there remain many challenging problems in biomi-
metic control research. It is expected that theoretical study of hybrid system control may also lead
to a better understanding of biological motor control functions at the high level of brain motor
cortex and basal ganglia.

INTRODUCTION
Vision is an enormously complex form of information processing that depends on a remarkable
neuroprocessor at the back of the eye called the retina (Figure 17.1). For an intelligent living being
to see, every component of this complex system has to work in tandem. Blindness can result when
any step of the optical pathway — the optics, the retina, the optic nerve, visual cortex, or other
cortical areas involved in the processing of vision — sustains damage (Zrenner, 2002).
427

Blindness afﬂicts more than 1 million Americans; approximately 10% amongst them have no
light perception (Chiang et al., 1992). Some of these patients can be considered for experimental
approaches, such as gene therapy and drugs, to prevent the development of blindness. But there are
very few approaches to treatment of total loss of vision; one of them considered to be a serious
contender is visual prosthesis.
During the 18th century, scientists began to understand that electricity could elicit a response in
biological tissues. This knowledge has been applied to medicine with electronic implants such as
the cardiac pacemakers and cochlear implants. Success of these implantable devices and improved
electronic technology aroused interest in the development of a visual prosthesis that could help
blind people.

Initial work in the ﬁeld of visual prostheses started with electrical stimulation of the visual cortex.
Direct electrical stimulation of the cortical surface under local anesthesia of a sighted human
subject resulted in seeing a spot of light, described as phosphene. The position of the light in space
corresponded correctly to the stimulated anatomical region (Foerster, 1929; Greenberg et al., 1999).
Subsequently, similar results were obtained in blind patients (Maynard, 2001; Ranck, 1975). Also,
further experiments showed that a chronically activated electrical stimulation device could be safe,
and the patient could read random letters (Button and Putnam, 1962; Brindley and Lewin, 1968;
Brindley and Rushton, 1974).
In spite of the success with the experiments (Pollen, 1977; Dobelle and Mladejovsky, 1974),
there were major issues that prevented widespread use: high currents and large electrodes were
required to induce phosphenes (Karny, 1975); a single stimulating electrode induced multiple
phosphenes; those produced were sometimes inconsistent. Other drawbacks included limited
two-point discrimination, local heating and electrolysis (Bak et al., 1990), phosphene persistence
following cessation of electrical stimulation (Dobelle et al., 1976), and phosphene ﬂickering during
surface stimulation (Brindley and Lewin, 1968; Pollen, 1977; Karny, 1975). These problems forced
development of intracortical electrodes (Dobelle et al., 1976; Uematsu et al., 1974; Schmidt et al.,

eceptors convert light into neural signals that are then transmitted to the proximal visual centers by the optic nerve.
The optic nerve is composed of 1 million axons from the retinal ganglion cells, which are the output cells of the
retina. In outer retinal diseases, the photoreceptors are degenerated, but the inner retina cells remain and can be
electrically stimulated.

1996; Normann et al., 1999; Jones and Normann, 1997; Maynard et al., 1997; Nordhausen et al.,
1996). Experiments done with intracortical electrodes conﬁrmed that the stimulus current threshold
was 10 to 100 times lower than that for stimulation using surface electrodes (Dobelle et al., 1976).
Subjects were also able to perceive phosphenes at a predictable and reproducible location in the
visual space (Schmidt et al., 1996). Separate patterned perceptions could be evoked by electrical
stimulation via electrodes spaced as close as 500 mm apart. The preferable stimulation location was
probably the fourth layer of the visual cortex (Dobelle et al., 1976).
Undoubtedly, the lower current threshold of the intracortical microstimulation, the predictable
forms of generated phosphenes, the capability of increasing the number of electrodes, power
requirement improvement, and the current reduction per microelectrode are the main advantages
of the intracortical microstimulation approach (Dobelle et al., 1976; Schmidt et al., 1996). Also, the
skull protects both the electronics and the electrode array. The cortical prosthesis will bypass all
diseased neurons distal to the primary visual cortex, and hence, has the potential to restore vision to
the largest number of blind patients. However, there are problems in this approach. Spatial
organization is more complex at the cortical level and two adjacent cortical loci do not necessarily
map out to two adjacent areas in visual space, so that patterned electrical stimulation may not
produce the desired patterned perception. In addition, the convoluted cortical surface makes it
difﬁcult for implantation, and surgical complications can have serious and devastating complica-
tions, including death.
17.1.2
Concept of Retinal Prostheses
A patent for a subretinal microphotodiode was issued to Graham Tassicker in the 1950s. This is the
ﬁrst written record of a retinal prosthesis. The device was never realized as described in the patent.
During the early 1970s, it was found that blind humans can also perceive electrically elicited
phosphenes in response to ocular stimulation, with a contact lens on the cornea as the stimulating
electrode (Potts et al., 1968; Potts and Inoue, 1969, 1970). When obtainable, these electrically
elicited responses indicated the presence of at least some functioning inner retinal cells. Clearly,
stimulation through a single channel on the cornea could not produce form vision, yet it did
demonstrate that electrical stimulation at the level of the eye could evoke phosphenes in blind
subjects.
The idea of stimulating the remaining inner retina with an electrode array on the retinal surface
came about due to the fact that a number of blinding retinal diseases are predominantly outer retinal
or photoreceptor degeneration (Stone et al., 1992; Santos et al., 1997; Humayun et al., 1999a,b).
Two of the more common outer retinal degeneration diseases are retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-
related macular degeneration (AMD). Incidence of RP is 1 in 4000 live births; there are approxi-
mately 1.5 million people affected worldwide and it is the leading cause of inherited blindness
(Berson et al., 1993). AMD is the main cause of visual loss amongst older adults (>65 years old) in
Western countries. Annually, there are approximately 700,000 new patients in the U.S. who lose
vision due to AMD; 10% of these become legally blind each year (Curcio et al., 1996).
Analysis of eyes with outer retinal degeneration suggests that cells are present, but the retinal
circuitry is disrupted. Morphometric analysis of the RP retina has revealed that many more inner
nuclear layer cells (bipolar cells and others — 78.4%) are retained compared to outer nuclear layer
(photoreceptors — 4.9%), and ganglion cell layer — 29.7% (Potts and Inoue, 1970; Stone et al.,
1992). Similar results were obtained from AMD patients (Kim et al., 2002). Thus, it appeared
feasible to stimulate remaining retinal neurons. However, more recent studies of animal and human
retina with outer retina disease have shown that the retinal circuitry and structure undergoes
signiﬁcant changes after photoreceptor loss.
Stimulation in blind humans with temporarily implanted electrodes demonstrated the principle
of electrical stimulation with epiretinal electrodes. Focal electrical stimulation elicited phosphenes
in all patients; four out of ﬁve patients were able to describe spatial and temporal aspects of
Interfacing Microelectronics and the Human Visual System
429

the stimuli. The resolution could be estimated to be 4.5/2000, a crude ambulatory vision (Humayun
et al., 1996). The electrical stimulation threshold has been found to be dependent on the location of
the electrode; the macular region required higher threshold currents than the peripheral retina to
elicit visual perceptions. Also, patients with less advanced RP or AMD required lower threshold
currents than those with more advanced disease stages. These ﬁndings are important because lower
thresholds would allow for smaller electrodes and greater resolution. Lower threshold values in
healthier retinae were later conﬁrmed by other experiments (Suzuki et al., 1999; Chen et al., 1999;
Weiland et al., 1999; Rizzo et al., 2000; Majji et al., 1999). Perhaps the most important result of
these studies was associated with form recognition. Patients were able to identify crude forms such
as letters or a box shape during the short period of electrical stimulation testing. When the electrical
stimulation ended, there was no persistence of the image. Another group later conﬁrmed this result
of form recognition by electrical stimulation of a healthy retina of a sighted volunteer (Rizzo et al.,
2000). Other important psychophysical perceptions of this study included ﬂicker fusion (at a
frequency of 40 to 50 Hz) and different color perceptions (Humayun et al., 1999a,b).
17.1.3
Optic Nerve Prostheses
Attempts have been made to stimulate the optic nerve to generate optical impulse. But the high
density of the axons within the optic nerve (1.2  106 within a 2-mm diameter cylindrical structure)
could make it difﬁcult to achieve focal stimulation and detailed perception. In addition, any surgical
approach to the optic nerve requires dissection of the dura and can have harmful side-effects.
Similar to the retina prosthesis approach, optic nerve stimulation requires intact RGCs and is
limited to outer retinal pathologies. A volunteer with retinitis pigmentosa and no residual vision
was chronically implanted with an optic nerve electrode connected to an implanted neurostimulator
and antenna. An external controller with telemetry was used for electrical activation of the nerve
which resulted in phosphene perception. Low perception thresholds allowed for large current
intensity range within safety limits. In a closed-loop paradigm, the volunteer was using a video
camera to explore a projection screen. The volunteer underwent performance evaluation during the
course of a training program with 45 simple patterns. After learning, the volunteer reached a
recognition score of 63% with a processing time of 60 sec. Mean performance in orientation
discrimination reached 100% with a processing time of 8 sec (Veraart et al., 2003).
17.1.4
Sensory Substitution Devices
An alternative to direct stimulation of the visual system has been tried and is being developed to aid
visually handicapped people. This method attempts to convert visual information into vibro-tactil
or auditory signals (i.e., sensory substitution devices) (Margalit et al., 2004; Brabyn, 1982; Rita
et al., 1998).
17.2
CURRENT CONCEPTS IN RETINAL PROSTHETIC DEVICES
Worldwide, there are currently several groups involved in the process of development of retinal
prostheses. Their respective work is classiﬁed according to the location of the device in relation to
the retina: on the retinal surface (epiretinal), or behind the retina (subretinal). There is also another
group in Japan developing a new approach, suprachoroidal–transretinal stimulation (STS), where
the array is to be placed in the suprachoroidal space (Kanda et al., 2004).
Epiretinal implantation has the advantage of keeping the majority of electronics outside the eye,
minimizing the risk of failure, and optimizing the ease of replacement or upgrading the electronics.
Additionally, the majority of the intraocular electronics could be placed in the vitreous cavity, a
naturally existing space, which is ﬂuid ﬁlled postsurgery. This greatly helps in dissipating the heat
430
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

generated by the electronics (Majji et al., 1999; Eckmiller, 1997; Rizzo and Wyatt, 1997).
However, an epiretinal prosthesis will be exposed to ocular rotational movements, making the
need for a nontraumatic and yet sturdy attachment method paramount. Also, by physically being
closer to the retinal ganglion cells (RGC), it may be difﬁcult to stimulate bipolar cells and therefore
one may lose visual processing that takes place in this layer.
The subretinal positioning of the retinal prosthesis has the advantage of placing the stimulating
electrodes close to the bipolar cells, which may also permit lower stimulus thresholds (Zrenner
et al., 1997, 1999; Chow and Peachey, 1998; Tassicker, 1956; Chow and Chow, 1997; Peyman et al.,
1998; Guenther et al., 1999). However, the placement of any object between the choroid and the
retina can be more disruptive to the nutritional supply of the retina derived from the choroids
(Zrenner et al., 1999). Another drawback of this method is the limited amount of light that can reach
the array coupled with the inefﬁciency of modern day photovoltaic or solar cells. This translates
into using a very bright image intensiﬁer (10 suns) in order for the stimulator chip to generate the
level of currents that have resulted in visual perceptions in the blind.
There are advantages and disadvantages of the retinal stimulation approaches. The advantages
include the ability to use the retinotopic organization of the eye in addition to the natural processing
ability along the proximal visual pathways. Furthermore, the vitreous cavity ﬂuid can be utilized as
a heat sink and the prosthesis can be visualized by dilating the pupil in an out-patient setting. Less
surgical morbidity and mortality are expected in comparison to any of the cortical prostheses
implantation methods. But there are disadvantages as well. These include possible disruption of
retinotopic organization due to stimulation of ganglion cells’ axons along their path to the optic
nerve, as axons from different retinal locations pass within short distances from each other.
Ganglion cells encode many properties of the visible light (color, intensity, onset of light, extinction
of light, etc.) and the question is which property will be encoded during electrical stimulation if
many ganglion cells are activated simultaneously. Also, this approach will probably be limited to
outer retinal pathologies.
Suprachoroidal–transretinal stimulation approach has the electrodes away from the retina. The
anodic stimulating electrode is positioned on the choroidal membrane, while the cathode is placed
in the vitreous body. STS is expected to activate the retinal network on the basis that various types
of transretinal stimulation induce ﬁeld responses in central visual areas (Lederman and Noell, 1969;
Potts et al., 1970; Crapper and Noell, 1963; Shimazu et al., 1999). Since the STS is not in contact
with the retina, it may require a high threshold for stimulation of the retinal circuitry. The strong
electrical stimulation may damage the retina and increase the power load on implanted electronic
devices. It may also stimulate a broader area of the retina, resulting in low resolution.
A different approach to retinal prostheses is the Artiﬁcial Synapse Chip (Peterman et al., 2003).
This group is working on a high-resolution, physiologic ﬂexible retinal interface, incorporating cell
micropatterning and localized chemical stimulation with ﬂexible biocompatible materials. This
device aims to improve visual resolution of an electronic retinal prosthesis by addressing cells
individually and mimicking the physiological stimulation achieved in synaptic transmission. By
patterning the growth of cells to individual stimulation sites, the selectivity of stimulation is
increased by selective stimulation of individual cells amongst closely packed neighbors, while
decreasing the distance of cells from the stimulation sites and therefore the associated power
requirements. This technology is to be coupled to a prosthesis based on localized, microﬂuidic
neurotransmitter delivery.
Another approach to a retinal implant has been dubbed ‘‘Hybrid Implant.’’ This approach
proposes to develop an integrated circuit, which would include both electronic and cellular
components. The electronics will perform image recognition and the neurons on the device will
extend their axons to synapse with the lateral geniculate body and thus create a device–CNS
interface and restore vision (Yagi and Watanabe, 1998). The advantage of this approach would
be its capability of reconstructing an eye with total or inner retinal degeneration. Disadvantages
include difﬁculties in precisely directing axons to the lateral geniculate body, developing the
Interfacing Microelectronics and the Human Visual System
431

interface between the electronics and neurons, and the matrix to enable survival of the cellular
components while being housed in microelectronics.
17.2.1
Simulations of Prosthetic Vision
One of the major arguments supporting the concept of a retinal prosthesis is the fact that cochlear
implant patients can understand speech with only six input channels. Simulations of cochlear implant
audition have shown that speech reduced to as few as four frequencies provides enough information
for the human brain to understand language. Similarly, it is hoped that visual prostheses will be able
to transmit useful information without replacing the input from all 100 million photoreceptors.
Several experiments were done to deﬁne the minimum acceptable resolution for useful vision. Early
studies in this area focused on simulating prosthetic vision from a cortical implant. The points of
stimulation (pixels) required for speciﬁc activities varied from 80 to more than 600, depending on
the activity being performed (Brindley, 1965). Most recent studies show that 625 pixels is a better
estimate for certain tasks. It was concluded that 625 electrodes implanted in a 1 cm2 area near the
foveal representative of the visual cortex could produce a phosphene image with a visual acuity of
approximately 20/30. Such acuity could provide useful restoration of functional vision for the
profoundly blind (Cha et al., 1992a–c).
Although these studies began to delineate the number of electrodes needed, the fact that all the
pixels were projected on a very small area of the retina, made it impractical to translate to the design
of a retinal prosthesis, in which the electrodes would be spread over the entire macular region. Thus,
a low vision enhancement system (LVES) has been modiﬁed to ﬁlter images on a head mounted
display in order to simulate pixelized prosthetic vision and to produce an array of dots. The results
suggested that a fair level of visual function can be achieved for facial recognition and reading large
print text using pixelized vision parameters such as a 25  25 grid in a 108 ﬁeld, with high contrast
imaging and four or more gray levels.
17.3
MECHANICAL EFFECTS OF IMPLANTATION OF RETINAL PROSTHESIS
Retinal tissue is delicate and can easily tear or detach from the back of the eye. The delicate nature
of the retinal tissue can also predispose it to pressure necrosis by a chronic implant being placed on
it. Increased intraocular pressure, typical in glaucoma, can lead to damage to retinal ganglion cells
and signiﬁcant visual loss. Also, there is an abundant blood supply within and underneath the retina.
Disruption of this vasculature can lead to chronic inﬂammation or new blood vessel formation, both
of which can lead to retinal damage. Studies have shown that an epiretinal array can be secured to
the inner retinal surface in a safe and secure manner, is mechanically stable, and biologically
tolerated over a 6-month period (Majji et al., 1999).
Any intraocular implantable device has to be tested for biocompatibility. Since these devices are
to remain within the intraocular environment for many years, they have to continue to be electric-
ally effective, and also not cause mechanical damage over time. Moreover, the device should also
not undergo long term degradation, like corrosion, in the ocular environment.
17.3.1
Infection and Inﬂammation
The eye, as is the central nervous system, has been described as immunological or partially
immunological privileged (Rocha et al., 1992). Despite this fact, the inﬂammatory course is
identical to that occurring elsewhere in the body once an incitement for inﬂammation has occurred
(Oehmichen, 1983). Mere surgical manipulation, any infection, biodegradation or any release of
toxic substances from a foreign body can provoke a severe inﬂammatory response. Bacterial
infections are often delayed and appear to be due in part to the host’s inability to respond properly
432
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

to infections. Their origins are frequently distant infected sites in the body or skin ﬂora (Dougherty
and Simmons, 1982).
17.3.2
Ocular Side-Effects of Long Term Implantation
Since the ﬁeld of retinal implants is relatively new, there are few reports available on the long-term
side-effects or complications related to implantation of a device. Sham surgeries have been done,
with no electrical stimulation, to simulate prosthetic implantation, to study the mechanical damage
to the eye. In one such study, performed in four dogs, mild retinal folds were noticed at one edge of
the array, which did not progress over time; there was no retinal detachment (RD) seen in any of the
dogs. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) changes were noted near the retinal tacks which are used to
ﬁx the epiretinal implant (Majji et al., 1999). In another study (Walter et al., 1999), nine out of ten
rabbits were implanted without serious complications. The implant was found to be stable at the
original ﬁxation site and there was no change noted in retinal architecture underneath the implant
by light microscopy. In three cases, mild cataract formation was observed, while in one case, a total
RD was found after a 6-month follow-up. In another study, three rabbits were implanted with an
electrode array in the subretinal space. No side-effects were reported (Chow and Chow, 1997).
The anatomy and physiology of the retina evaluated after implantation of a retinal implant.
Vascular integrity was evaluated by injection of ﬂuorescent dye into the blood stream and
subsequent imaging of the dye’s presence in the ocular blood ﬂow (a technique called ﬂuorescein
angiography). Good vascular perfusion was noted during the entire follow-up period of more than 6
months (Majji et al., 1999). Also, in the same study, electroretinogram (ERG) ﬁndings were found
to be within reasonable limits after the surgery. There is histopathological conﬁrmation that the
retina underneath an epiretinal array does not undergo any damage over 6 months of follow-up.
Light microscopy and electron microscopy have proved that the retinal microstructure does not
show any signs of degradation over this time, though the area around the tack showed localized loss
of retinal and RPE layers.
A single volunteer with end-stage RP has been chronically implanted with an optic nerve cuff
electrode connected to an implanted neurostimulator and antenna in February 1998. Chronic
follow-up of this patient has not shown any side-effects to the surgery or the presence of electrodes
around the optic nerve.
17.3.3
Attachment of the Implant to the Retina
Any implanted device will be exposed to the ocular movements, especially in cases where vitreous
surgery replaces the vitreous gel with ﬂuid-ﬁlled cavity, where counter-currents from the ﬂuid can
generate forces on the epiretinal implant; hence, it requires a stable ﬁxation to its intended anatomic
location. Ocular rotational movements have been recorded to reach 7008 visual angle/sec. These
extreme movements can certainly dislodge the epiretinal device and move it away from the required
location. The subretinal implant will not face the same counter-current movements as an epiretinal
implant would, since it is expected to stay within the conﬁnes of the subretinal space taking the
advantage of the adherence forces between the sensory retina and the retinal pigment epithelium.
Even though the likelihood of displacement of such devices is low, they have been known to be
displaced after implantation (Peyman et al., 1998). Surgical implantation of such a device can be
either through the sclera (ab externo) or intraocularly through a retinotomy site after a vitrectomy
procedure.
There have been various approaches to the attachment of the epiretinal implant or device to the
retina. Bioadhesives, retinal tacks, and magnets have been considered and tested as some of the
methods for the array attachment. Retinal tacks and the electrode array have been shown to be
ﬁrmly attached to the retina for up to 1 year of follow-up with no signiﬁcant clinical or histological
side-effects (Majji et al., 1999). Similar results were seen in rabbits (Walter et al., 1999).
Interfacing Microelectronics and the Human Visual System
433

There have been studies on the use of commercially available compounds for their suitability as
intraocular adhesives in rabbits. One type of adhesive (SS-PEG hydrogel, Shearwater Polymers,
Inc.) proved to be strongly adherent and nontoxic to the retina (Margalit et al., 2000). Other groups
have done similar experiments (Lowenstein et al., 1999).
The preferable ﬁxation site for the intracortical microstimulation arrays is the cortex itself; skull
will not be a good site due to the brain’s constant movement in relation to the skull. These arrays are
currently inserted either manually in an individual fashion or in a group of 2 to 3 electrodes normal
to the cortical surface to a depth of 2 mm or by a pneumatic system that inserts 100-electrode arrays
into the cortex in about 200 msec.
17.3.4
Hermetic Sealing of the Electronics
Prostheses will be composed of electronic parts within the eye. These components will be exposed
to the chemical environment in the eye. These implanted parts will have to be sealed, such that they
are not exposed to corrosion of the ocular ﬂuids. Also, this protective coat will have to last for some
years or decades for the continued functioning of the implant. The requirement of hermetically
sealing a circuit in the case of neural stimulating devices is complicated by the demand that
multiple conductors (feedthroughs) must penetrate the hermetic package so that the stimulation
circuit can be electrically connected to each electrode site in the array. These connections are the
most vulnerable leakage points in the system (Margalit et al., 2004).
17.4
ELECTRICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN RETINAL PROSTHETIC DEVICES
The effectiveness of an electrical stimulation for an intraocular retinal prosthesis, whether epiretinal
or subretinal, is governed by a number of parameters characteristic of the electrode array, including
shape and size of the electrodes, spacing between electrodes, electrode materials, current return
positions, and stimulating current waveform, to name a few. Optimal electrode array type and
characteristics must also take into account other factors that can inﬂuence the one or more
parameters, including thermal or electrical safety or ease of surgical implantation.
17.4.1
Stimulating Electrodes: General Considerations with Regard to Electrical
Stimulation of the Retina
The characteristics of the stimulating electrode array are often of competing nature: for example, it
might be desirable to mechanically position the electrodes as close as possible to the ganglion and
bipolar cells, but that would then result in penetrating electrodes that could harm the fragile
structure of the retina. Similarly, it may appear natural to develop small electrodes to achieve
high-resolution electrical stimulation of the retina; however, current densities needed to elicit
phosphenes may exceed safety limits and potentially cause damage to the retina. Further, it is not
completely clear, to say the least, the relation between size of the electrode and size of the visual
spot induced by that electrode.
The problem is phenomenally complex, as it simultaneously involves neural activation at the
microscopic level and control of the spread of the current in retinal tissue at the macroscopic level.
Both problems are strongly coupled and involve very different scales and methods of analysis,
which increases the complexity of solving the problem of optimal stimulation of retinal tissue and,
indirectly, the problem of optimal physical characteristics of the stimulating electrode arrays.
Besides geometrical considerations that can affect the effectiveness of the electrical stimulation
of the retinal tissue, other aspects of the system design can have a signiﬁcant impact on the induced
stimulation. Among the challenges that must be considered to achieve optimal electrical stimula-
tion, in the sense of an electrical stimulation which uses as little current as possible to elicit visual
434
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

perception, there are the actual characteristics of the ‘‘contact’’ between retina and electrode, which
strongly impact the current magnitude and direction in retinal tissue. In fact, even though each layer
of the retina is characterized by a different conductivity, the vitreous humor is in general signiﬁ-
cantly more conductive than each of the layers of the retinal tissue. The consequences of this can
easily be understood by thinking of the vitreous humor as the ‘‘preferred path’’ of the electrical
current as opposed to the retina, if the conditions are such to make this possible. Therefore, if a
stimulating electrode has its surface in contact with the vitreous humor, and not only with the retina
as it may happen for example with dome-shaped electrodes with only the tip in actual contact with
the retina, most of the current will tend to ﬂow through the vitreous humor without passing through
the retina when the current return is located in the eyeball. This, in turn, may result in higher
currents needed to stimulate the retina and therefore elicit vision. It is therefore clear that the choice
of stimulating electrodes in terms of shape, size, and characteristics, as well as the system design in
its entirety, including the choice of the current return location for the electrodes, can have a
substantial impact on the effectiveness of the electrical stimulation of the retina. This, in turn,
has a signiﬁcant impact on the feasibility of the entire system, since a more effective stimulation
will require less current, which will result in less power dissipation by the stimulating microchip,
leading to a lower temperature increase in the eye and surrounding tissue due to the operation of the
retinal prosthesis.
17.4.2
The Impedance Method for the Solution of Quasi-Static
Electromagnetic Problems
The problem of characterizing the current spread in retinal tissue, which can also lead to a better
understanding of the neural activation once coupled with models of the neural cells, can be solved
through quasi-static electromagnetic methods. A very versatile method that has a number of
beneﬁts in the modeling of the system is the impedance method (Gandhi et al., 1984) (or admittance
method [Armitage et al., 1983]), but other methods based on the solution of the quasi-static
electromagnetic problem can be used as well (ﬁnite-element method, ﬁnite-difference method,
scalar potential ﬁnite-difference method [Dawson et al., 1996], to name a few). The impedance
method is based on the discretization of the physical model that must be modeled into computa-
tional cells. The edges of these computational cells are impedances (or admittances) which are
computed using the electrical conductivity of the material in the cell and the width, length, and
height of the computational cell. Therefore, the physical model is represented by means of an
electrical network with resistance or admittances derived from the physical properties of the
physical model itself. In its basic formulation, the impedance method uses uniform cells to
discretize the physical model; however, nonuniform cells, leading to a multiresolution impedance
method, can be used to reduce the computational time and computer memory needed to solve the
problem (Eberdt et al., 2003).
The problem of characterizing the current spread in the retina translates, therefore, into the
problem of developing an accurate model of the eye and the retina, with a geometrical resolution
sufﬁciently high to describe current variations on the geometrical scale of interest (DeMarco et al.,
2003). Even with the multiresolution impedance method, however, it is extremely challenging to
develop a model that reaches cellular scales in the retinal tissue and at the same time covers an
extended area such as the entire eyeball. Therefore, some compromise must be reached in terms of
resolutions vs. geometrical scales of interest for the complete characterization of the system.
A possible approach is to discretize the ﬁne retinal structure and electrode geometries with
resolutions as low as 5 mm, for example, and subsequently use neural models with the current
levels found in the neural layers in order to model the response to electrical signals. Another
approach would be the direct coupling of the macro-scale current spread modeling with electrical
circuits to model the neural interaction. This is because in methods such as the impedance or
admittance methods, there is no restriction on the circuit element used between two nodes. In the
Interfacing Microelectronics and the Human Visual System
435

simplest case this is impedance related to the electrical properties of the biological tissue or
electrodes: in more complex cases it can be an arbitrarily complex circuit that can be solved with
circuit simulators such as SPICE1. In fact, the entire impedance or admittance network can be
solved with such circuit simulators, with subcircuits describing speciﬁc functions or particular
behaviors related to the electrical stimulation.
Figure 17.2 shows an example of a multiresolution computational mesh of a retinal section, with
its various layers classiﬁed and associated to a conductivity speciﬁc for each of them (Eberdt et al.,
2003). Figure 17.3 shows instead the current spread in this classiﬁed model of the retina for two
types of electrodes, coaxial electrodes and dome electrodes with side current return, respectively, as
obtained by two-dimensional multiresolution impedance method simulations. It can be qualita-
tively seen that the current magnitudes in various layers of the retina depend upon the type of
electrode. Higher resolution and coupling with neural models can also be incorporated in these
models. It should be noted, however, that there is a degree of uncertainty with respect to a number
of parameters, such as the conductivity of each layer, which is estimated based on water content and
afﬁnity with other tissues, and actual retinal geometric features, which can be signiﬁcantly distorted
in diseased retinas.
17.5
RETINAL PROSTHESIS AND RELATED THERMAL EFFECTS
An implantable device for neural stimulation should generally receive power and data wirelessly
(Rucker and Lossinsky, 1999) — through a telemetry link — process the received data, and inject
currents in the neural tissue by means of a number of stimulating electrodes that in general need to
accommodate desired waveforms, frequency of stimulation, and amplitudes of stimulating signals.
Each of these characteristics is generally responsible for power dissipation, which may result in
thermal increase in the human body in proximity of the implanted device.
A dual-unit epiretinal prosthesis (DeMarco et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2000), consisting of
an extraocular unit with an external camera for image collection, a data encoding chip, and the
primary coil for inductive power and data transfer and an intraocular unit with the secondary
coil, data processing chips, an electrode stimulator chip, and the electrode array for epiretinal
stimulation, could potentially lead to signiﬁcant temperature increase in the eye and surrounding
tissues.

The wireless link causes electromagnetic power deposition in the head and eye tissues, which
could lead to indirect thermal rise in the tissue, known to be the dominant physiological hazard due
to power deposition in human tissues (Adair and Petersen, 2002). Moreover, the implanted
electronic IC chips will dissipate power in the form of heat, which will directly lead to the thermal
elevation in the surrounding tissues. It is therefore necessary to quantify these thermal effects in
order to determine the safe limits of operation of the prosthetic system.
The temperature rise in the head and eye tissues due to the operation of the prosthesis can be
experimentally determined with in vivo experiments or computationally evaluated by means of a
computer code for the solution of the bio-heat equation. Preliminary computational predictions
have been performed to evaluate the thermal inﬂuence of a dual-unit epiretinal prosthesis system on
the human head and eye tissues and, therefore, provide a quantitative measure of the temperature
rise in human body as a result of the operation of an implantable neurostimulator. As an example of
typical methods and results, the following paragraphs and subsections provide a brief account of the
methods and model used in such bio-engineering computations.
To quantify the thermal impact of the dual-unit epiretinal prosthesis system, the bio-heat
equation can be numerically discretized both spatially and temporally using the well-known
ﬁnite-difference time domain (FDTD) method (Sullivan, 2000; Wang and Fujiwara, 1999). In
this example, the computational prediction was performed on a very high-resolution anatomically
accurate three-dimensional human head model obtained from the National Library of Medicine
(The National Library of Medicine, The Visible Human Project, 2000). For the computational
study, the different tissues in the head model were modeled by their dielectric and thermal
properties (DeMarco et al., 2003). Figure 17.4 shows the head model, which was utilized in the
computational domain to evaluate the natural steady state (or basal, initial) temperature distribution
in the model (due to the internal tissue metabolism with no implanted heat sources).

The bio-heat equation is developed from the well-known heat equation (Necati, 1985) by con-
sidering the additional sources of thermal inﬂuence for computations involving the human body
(DeMarco et al., 2003; Bernardi et al., 2003; Gosalia et al., 2004). In the presence of implantable
devices and sources of electromagnetic power deposition, the bio-heat equation is given as:

which equates the product of thermal capacitance (Cr) and temperature rise per unit time to the

Besides the bio-heat equation, the heat exchange at the tissue interface with the external environ-
ment has to be modeled accurately. At this interface, a boundary condition to model the heat
exchange with the surrounding environment is imposed on the computations,

where n is perpendicular to the skin surface and the right hand expression models the heat losses
from the surface of the skin due to convection and radiation, which is proportional to the difference
between skin temperature (T(x, y, z)) and external environmental temperature (Ta).
For all the computations performed in the example above, the temperature of blood was
assumed to be constant at 378C, while Ha is the heat convection coefﬁcient and is assumed to be
10.5 W/(m2
. 8C). The thermal parameters for all the tissues in the head model have been directly
obtained from previous studies (DeMarco et al., 2003; Bernardi et al., 2003).
In order to validate the thermal method and model used, in vivo experiments conducted with dogs
were simulated, and experimental and computational results were compared. The experiment com-
prised of mechanically holding a heater probe (1.4  1.4  1.0 mm in size) dissipating 500 mW in the
vitreous cavity of the eye of the dog for 2 h (Gosalia et al., 2004; Piyathaisere et al., 2003). The
experimental set up included thermocouples to measure the temperature rise at different locations in
the vitreous cavity and the retina during this period. Figure 17.5 shows the comparison between the
experimentally observed and the simulated results for temperature rise at the retina and the vitreous
cavity. The uncertainty in the exact locations of the thermocouples during the actual experiment is the
likely cause of the small difference between simulated and experimental results.
17.5.1
Heat and the Telemetry System
As mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, the wireless telemetry system can be a source of thermal
rise since it causes deposition of electromagnetic (EM) power in the head and eye tissues. Using the
FDTD technique, the deposited EM power can be quantiﬁed in terms of the speciﬁc absorption rate
(SAR) and several studies have quantiﬁed the thermal effects in the human head and eye tissues
based on the evaluated SAR using the bio-heat equation (DeMarco et al., 2003; Bernardi et al.,
1998, 2000; Hirata et al., 2000). SAR is expressed as sE

and mass density r at each cell (x, y, z) in the computational model. In the radiofrequency range, the
IEEE/ANSI (IEEE standard safety levels, 1999) safety limit for peak 1-g EM power deposition is
1.6 W/kg for the general population (the reader is encouraged to refer to the standard for a detailed
description of maximum permissible exposure [MPE], SAR, and effect of the frequency for EM
safety considerations). In general, if the EM power deposition remains well within this limit, the
thermal effects induced will be negligible. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify the EM power
deposition in the head tissues due to the wireless telemetry link to establish if there could be
potential hazards. As an example and to illustrate the procedure, we have used a circular coil of
approximately 37 mm diameter modeled at a distance of 20 mm from the eye and excited by a 2 A
current at the center operation frequency of 10 MHz. Computed peak 1-g SAR observed in the head
model due to such an excitation was 0.02 W/kg. At this currently estimated operating current level
for the wireless telemetry link, the SAR values do not exceed the IEEE safety limits for power
absorption (IEEE Standard exposure to RF, 1999). Thus, it can be reasonably concluded that the
contribution of SAR to the ﬁnal temperature elevation would be negligible compared to the rise in
temperature due to power dissipation in the implanted chip. In these cases, the power dissipation
due to the implanted chip and coil alone can be considered as the extraneous heat source (besides
the natural metabolism of the eye).
However, it should be noted that this will not always be the case. The peak 1-g SAR value
directly depends upon the wireless link employed for supplying power and data to the implanted
device, the geometrical characteristics of the wireless devices, the frequency of operation, their
placement with respect to the human body, and their power level. In general, one must evaluate the
SAR to ensure that it is within guidelines and determine whether such SAR could result in a thermal
increase and therefore would need to be included in the bio-heat equation.
17.5.2
Power Dissipation of Implanted Electronics
In order to compute the thermal elevation due to implanted electronics, the implanted chip was
modeled in the three-dimensional head model. The chip was modeled to have a composite thermal
conductivity K ¼ 60 J/(m sec 8C) and encapsulated in a 0.5-mm thick layer of insulation (K ¼ 60
J/[m sec 8C]). These values of thermal conductivity are very high compared to the values of the
tissues in the human head (Gosalia et al., 2004).
When an actual prosthesis is implanted, there are several parametric options that can be
explored to minimize the thermal elevation in the surrounding tissues. In order to characterize
these options, several thermal simulations were performed with the chip modeled with different
sizes, placed at different locations (within the eyeball) and also dissipating different amounts of
power in order to gain an insight into the best possible conﬁguration (from the point of view of least
thermal elevation) for an implant in the eye.
As an example of the impact of the location of the implanted microchip on the temperature
increase, we considered two locations for positioning the implanted unit within the eyeball of the
patient. In the ﬁrst case, the lens can be removed and the implanted chip hinged between the ciliary
muscles of the eye (referred to as the anterior position). The other considered position is in the
middle of the vitreous cavity parallel to the axis of the eyeball (referred to as the center position).
Both these cases were characterized computationally. The implanted chip was modeled at both
these locations and thermal simulations were performed to study the variation in temperature
increase in different human head tissues as a function of the implant location.
For both the above cases, the size of the implanted chip was kept constant at 4  4  0.5 mm
and was allowed to dissipate 12.4 mW (anticipated worst case power dissipation from an implanted
current stimulator chip driving a 16 electrode array positioned on the retina). The power density for
each cell of the model of the chip was calculated from the total power dissipated (12.4 mW) and was
kept uniform throughout the total volume of the chip (it should be noted that uniform power
dissipation is a further simpliﬁcation since such an implanted device could, in effect, exhibit
440

nonuniform ‘‘hot-spots’’). It was observed that within 26 min of actual stimulation time (because of
the extremely small time step in the FDTD simulations, the actual simulation time was signiﬁcantly
higher), the thermal elevation proﬁles in the tissues reached to within 5 to 7% of their ﬁnal values.
Since this provided a good indication of the approximate thermal rise, all the simulations were
performed for approximately 26 min (physical time).
The maximum temperature increase for both chip positions was observed on the surface of
the insulating layer. In both cases, the maximum thermal increase was approximately 0.828C. In the
ﬁrst case where the chip was placed in the anterior position, the temperature of the ciliary muscles
rose by 0.368C as compared to 0.198C when the chip was placed in the center position. In
the vitreous cavity, temperature rise was 0.268C for the chip placed in center of the eye while the
anterior chip raised its temperature by 0.168C (Gosalia et al., 2004).
A chip placed in the anterior chamber of the eye raised the temperature of the retina by less than
half the amount that a chip placed in the center did (0.05 8C by anterior chip as compared to 0.128C
by a center chip) (Gosalia et al., 2004). In these simulations, it was observed that the vitreous cavity
was acting as a heat sink since the rise in temperature of tissues beyond the eyeball is very small.
A graphic comparison of the thermal elevation observed for the anterior and the center placed chips
is provided in Figure 17.6. The anterior position is certainly preferable for the implanted unit in
order to minimize the temperature rise in the vitreous cavity and on the retina.
A similar analysis can be performed to compute the impact of the size of the implant and
dissipated power on the temperature increase in the tissue (Gosalia et al., 2004). It is worth pointing
out, however, that power dissipation of the implanted microchip is probably the most signiﬁcant
parameter among all to be considered.
Two cases were considered in this example: in the ﬁrst case, the chip dissipated 12.4 mW
and in the second case, it dissipated 49.6 mW. For both of these cases, the size of the chip was

4  4  0.5 mm and it was placed in the center of the eyeball. Power density was again kept
uniform throughout the chip. The computation was performed for 26 min of simulated physical
time.
Figure 17.7 graphically compares the temperature increase observed on the insulation, in the
vitreous cavity and on the retina for both cases. From the thermal elevation results, it is observed
that increasing the power dissipation by a factor of 4 does not necessarily lead to a rise in the
temperature by the same factor. In the majority of tissues, a temperature rise by a factor of around
3.5 to 5 is observed for a four times increase in the power dissipation in the implant.
This preliminary investigation provided a qualitative and quantitative estimate of the thermal
inﬂuence of such an implanted prosthetic system in the eye. Also, in the actual system, the various
parametric variations can be optimized to yield the least harmful conﬁguration from the point of
view of thermal damage to the tissues of the eye of head. Several efforts are currently underway to
accurately quantify the contribution of each aspect of such a prosthetic conﬁguration to the eventual
thermal and electromagnetic inﬂuence on the human tissues.
17.6
FUTURE IMPLICATIONS
A retinal prosthesis will form several interfaces with the eye including thermal, electrical, and
mechanical. All of these interfaces must be considered simultaneously during the design of a safe
and effective retinal prosthesis. For example, it may be possible to reduce the thermal concerns by
using a larger electrode that consumes less power. However, such an electrode may stimulate a
large area of the retina and not allow ﬁne resolution vision. Many other optimization problems are
presented by such a complex interaction. Therefore, future designs may well need to use automated
optimization algorithms to yield the most effective device.

While future implants will depend on the continued advances in technology, the success of these
implants (i.e., helping the blind see) will be jeopardized if we do not understand the neurobiology of
the electrically stimulated visual system (Weiland and Humayun, 2003). The sense of vision is
enormously complex and the nervous system has the ability to remodel in response to new stimuli.
The development of prototypes that can be permanently implanted in research animals now gives
us the ability to study these effects by applying advanced microscopy and tissue labeling methods
developed in neuroscience basic research. While these studies are absolutely necessary and will
yield valuable information, human implant studies are the only way to verify the effectiveness of
the devices. Therefore, a multifaceted effort including technology development, biological re-
search, and strict monitored, limited human tests is needed to advance the current artiﬁcial vision
devices from proof-of-principle to accepted clinical treatment for blindness.

SUMMARY
The work in visual prostheses has come a long way from the days of laboratory research and the
initial volunteer experiments. Today, we have a few patients implanted with the actual device; these
devices have shown no major side-effect or complication related to surgery. Some of these patients
have shown encouraging responses. Artiﬁcial visual stimulus is being tried at various levels, from
the retina all the way to the cortex. Each type of implant has its own advantages and problems. The
implant has to be not only biocompatible, but also be able to avoid damage from corrosion in the
biological spaces the device will be implanted in. Long term damage from electrical current is an
issue, as is the issue with the type of vision generated by the blind patients through these implants.
There are several challenges involved and issues to be considered during the design and
development of a retinal prosthetic system, which can restore a limited form of vision. The
electrical considerations of the prosthetic system (size and shape of electrodes, magnitude of
current injection, size and shape of the implanted unit and its power dissipation, frequency, and
strength of the wireless telemetry link) are closely coupled with safety considerations of the entire
system (maximum allowable current densities and thermal elevation). These issues have to be
resolved to realize a safe and effective retinal prosthesis system or any other implantable neuro-
stimulator with a large number of channels. Several electromagnetic methods and computational
techniques are being utilized to investigate the electrical performance characteristics of a prosthetic
implant. The impedance (or admittance) method coupled with the multiresolution meshing scheme
(to represent the intricate details of the retinal tissues — with a 5 mm resolution) appears very
promising for characterizing the current spread in the retinal layers for given current stimulation
and electrode array parameters. The computational implementation of the bio-heat equation
through the FDTD method has been utilized to characterize the thermal elevation in the eye and
head tissues due to the operation of the wireless telemetry link and power dissipation of the implant.
Both these numerical techniques employ a very high spatial resolution and anatomically accurate
model of the human head and eye. Tissues are represented by their dielectric and thermal properties
as required for the speciﬁc computational investigation. Using these methods, it is possible to
optimize the performance of an implantable neurostimulator such as the epiretinal prosthesis
system with respect to effectiveness of stimulation and power dissipation.

18.1
INTRODUCTION
Heart disease is a leading cause of death and contributes to 29% of total deaths in USA (Anderson
and Smith, 2003). About ﬁve million people suffer from heart failure each year with additional
500,000 being diagnosed new every year (AHA, 2003). Approximately 1,000,000 will die within
2 years of their diagnosis. Heart transplant is the only deﬁnitive therapy for these patients
(Baumgartner et al., 2002). Respiratory failure accounts for the fourth leading cause of death
followed by kidney and liver failure (Anderson and Smith, 2003). The current gold standard for
treating organ failure is transplantation (UNOS, 2003). There are strict criteria for patients to be
accepted as suitable candidates for transplantation and in 2002, there were close to 80,000 patients
in the USA on the waiting list to receive organ transplantation (UNOS, 2003). During the same year
24,000 received a transplant, with a majority (18,000) receiving them from deceased donors. The
latter accounted mostly for kidney and liver transplantation. In 2002, approximately 14,000 patients
had kidney transplants and in the same period 5,000 liver transplants were performed (UNOS,
2003). Each year approximately 3,000 heart transplants are performed (AHA, 2003; Baumgartner
et al., 2002; UNOS, 2003). As pointed out earlier, the strict criteria for organ transplantation mean
that many patients do not have the option of organ transplantation, in addition, as mentioned above,
a signiﬁcant number of patients die waiting for a transplant due to the mismatch in supply and
demand of the organs (Baumgartner et al., 2002; UNOS, 2003).
The only alternative for these patients today is the supportive management offered by artiﬁcial
organ systems. The design and development of the most of the artiﬁcial organ systems can be traced
to the 1950s and 1960s (Cooley et al., 1969; Gibbon, 1954; Gottschalk and Fellner, 1997; Kolff,
2002). The subsequent modiﬁcations were added later on as the experience with these systems
increased. The substitution of organ function by artiﬁcial organs represents one of the most
remarkable achievements in the 20th century (Lysaght and Reyes, 2001). It is currently estimated
that close to 20 million people worldwide derive beneﬁt of prolonging the organ function and
quality of life with the use of some kind of artiﬁcial medical implant (Lysaght and Hazlehurst,
2004; Malchesky, 2001). Artiﬁcial organ supports constitute a part of this population. It represents
a ﬁnancial spending of 350 billion per year on organ replacement therapy and is likely to increase
in the future as the population grows old in the next few decades (Lysaght and Reyes, 2001; Lysaght
and Hazlehurst, 2004; Malchesky, 2001).
18.2
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
The history of organ replacement can be traced to human origins. This happened when the primitive
man took support of a wooden stick to support an injured limb. However, the replacement or
mimicking of the internal human organs had to wait until after the industrial revolution, which
brought about the technical expertise combined with newer insights and understanding of human
anatomy and functioning. First such attempts were primarily to sustain the isolated organ function
outside the body by perfusion. LeGalliois (1813) ﬁrst proposed the idea of mechanically supporting
the circulation. In 1885, Von Frey and Gruber built a perfusion apparatus to sustain organ function
outside the body (Zimmer, 2001).
Alexis Carrel contributed monumental work in the perfusion studies and cell and organ cultures
in addition to some original work on organ transplantation at the beginning of the last century
(Zimmer, 2001). His work on the heart and vessels led him to the problem of biocompatibility of
materials (Malinin, 1996). A death of a close relative of Charles Lindbergh was the reason behind
the unexpected and unique collaboration between these two to develop a perfusion apparatus (Bing,
1987; Malinin, 1996). The original dream of Charles Lindbergh to bypass the function of the heart
and lungs to correct heart defects had to wait another 30 years, when Gibbon developed a heart–
lung machine (Gibbon, 1954).

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

At the same time, Willem Kolff, who saw a young patient dying of kidney failure, reasoned that
if urea can be removed from the blood, then that can prevent patients from dying. Using a simple
sausage tubing made of cellophane he was able to remove urea from the blood; this lead to the
development of the artiﬁcial kidney or what we call today, the hemodialysis machine (Kolff, 2002).
A chance observation of blue blood turning red during the early experiments with rotating drum
kidney led to the development of disc oxygenators. This was later helpful in devising the oxygen-
ators in the heart–lung machine, and ultimately led to the development of modern artiﬁcial lung,
what is known as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (Wolfson, 2003). Further
improvements in the artiﬁcial kidney led to the modern capillary membrane based hemodialysis
machines (Gottschalk and Fellner, 1997).
The work of Gott and Daggett was important in understanding the biocompatibility issues
in heart valve implants. They designed one of the ﬁrst bileaﬂet heart valves, with a graphite–
benzalkonium–heparin coating, and later proved the extraordinarily low thrombogeneicity with
pyrolytic carbon (Gott et al., 2003). This has been the primary component of valve implants for the
last 35 years.
The story of development of artiﬁcial human organs is both fascinating and remarkable.
Fascinating because, it made possible things which could only be dreamed of before. And
remarkable in the unique collaboration that developed between doctors, engineers, scientists, and
physicists from diverse disciplines that led to the development of various organ support systems
and replacement options. From the highs of achievements in 1950s and 1960s to the recent ugly
lawsuits concerning patents for artiﬁcial support systems, artiﬁcial organ development has wit-
nessed both public curiosity and skepticism with equal measure.
We will be reviewing the relevant historical landmark later in this chapter when we look at the
individual organ replacement systems. I have tried to keep the language as simple as possible,
avoiding medical jargon to aid easier understanding by nonmedical readers. It is impossible to
cover all the technical and medical details of all the artiﬁcial organs and organ replacement systems,
but I have made every effort to provide a glimpse of this fascinating ﬁeld. In a true sense of an
artiﬁcial organ, currently the heart is the only organ which can be replaced as an artiﬁcial implant in
the human body after removing the native heart, and as such I have focused on the current available
artiﬁcial heart and assist devices in more details. Other artiﬁcial medical implants have been
covered in corresponding chapters.
18.3
ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY
We have come a long way from the simple construct of sausage skin, a type of cellophane tubing
to remove toxins and harmful waste products (Kolff, 2002). The earlier advances consisted of
an artiﬁcial kidney made at Johns Hopkins by Abel and colleagues in 1913 using colloidon and
hirudin anticoagulant. It took another 15 years before the modiﬁcation of the Hopkins kidney
was used by Hass in Germany to perform ﬁrst clinical hemodialysis (Vienken et al., 1999). With
the use of a rotating drum kidney, developed by Willem Kolff in 1943, the modern era of
hemodialysis truly began (Gottschalk and Fellner, 1997). The advances in artiﬁcial kidney devel-
opment were halted due to the Second World War. Soon after the end of Second World War,
unprecedented technological developments made what was essentially an experimental therapy
into a routine clinical tool in treating kidney failure (Gottschalk and Fellner, 1997; Vienken
et al., 1999).
The modern dialyzers consist of semipermeable membranes which are conﬁgured into a hollow
ﬁber design. These membranes are essentially cellulose derived or noncellulose synthetic polymers.
High ﬂux membranes have a higher ultra ﬁltration coefﬁcient which facilitates higher clearance of
the solutes during ﬂuid removal. The technical and clinical aspects of the myriad of these devices
available are beyond the scope of this chapter.
Artiﬁcial Support and Replacement of Human Organs
451

Although hemodialysis revolutionized the treatment of kidney failure, it is far from perfect in
mimicking the functions of the kidney. Patients need to be hooked to the machine for prolonged
periods and therefore limit their mobility. Besides removing the toxic waste and maintaining the
electrolyte and water balance, the human kidney plays an important role in terms of endocrine and
metabolic activities. To solve this problem, and mimic the functioning of a normal human kidney,
developments are underway to develop a bio-artiﬁcial kidney which incorporates tubular cells in
the hollow ﬁbers (Moussy, 2000). Cells are grown as conﬂuent monolayers along the inner surface
of these hollow ﬁbers; the membrane acts as a scaffold and allows the cells to carry out the
important metabolic and endocrine activities (Humes et al., 1997; Nikolovski et al., 1999). Another
novel aspect of these cell-seeded hollow ﬁbers is that the cells are not exposed to the patient’s blood
and hence do not develop an immune response (Humes et al., 1997). Early results of these systems
are encouraging.
18.4
ARTIFICIAL LIVER
The liver plays an important role in the detoxiﬁcation, synthesis, and digestion in the body.
Currently, liver transplantation is the only viable and satisfactory option for liver failure (UNOS,
2003; van de Kerkhove et al., 2004). But the paucity and mismatch of demand and supply
of available donors is a major impediment for widespread application of this therapy. The liver
has a tremendous capacity to regenerate and if given adequate time to rest, the liver has the
capability of regrowing the damaged cells and can potentially recover. Currently, support systems
function as a bridge and try to exploit this regenerative capacity of the damaged liver until recovery
or transplantation. Attempts to replace the function of the liver are complex and currently are in
their infancy. Several earlier attempts to use hemodialysis to remove undesirable toxic products did
not meet with success (van de Kerkhove et al., 2004). Several other modalities like hemoﬁltration,
hemodiaﬁltration, and hemodiabsorption were not particularly attractive (van de Kerkhove et al.,
2004). One of the reasons is that these systems replace only one or two of the myriad functions
undertaken by the liver. However, a few of the promising techniques include the Molecular
Adsorbents Recirculating System (MARS), Artiﬁcial Liver Support Systems, and Albumin Dialysis
System (Jalan et al., 2004; Mullin et al., 2004; van de Kerkhove et al., 2004). These are based on
detoxiﬁcation of water soluble and protein bound toxins in dialysis (Boyle et al., 2004). But all of
these systems share the common disadvantage of inability to synthesize and produce liver speciﬁc
factors and proteins.
The above limitations have turned attention to options of biologically mimicking organ function
by using liver cells from animal and human origin (Kobayashi et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2004a–c).
Theoretically, they can carry out detoxiﬁcation, metabolic function, and synthesize important
proteins. Earlier attempts involved using cross-circulation with animal livers or liver-tissue pre-
parations (van de Kerkhove et al., 2004). Liver cells can be used in suspended, attached, or
encapsulated fashion with the aid of a semipermeable membrane akin to a bio-artiﬁcial kidney.
These are collectively called bio-artiﬁcial liver systems (Demetriou et al., 2004; Fruhauf et al.,
2004; Kobayashi et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2004a–c). Currently, there are few systems available which
have undergone even limited human trials (Demetriou et al., 2004). They include the Extracorpor-
eal Liver Assist System (ELAD), which uses a transformed hepatocyte cell line (Figure 18.1). Other
systems such as the HepatAssist System, the TECA-hybrid artiﬁcial liver support system, the bio-
artiﬁcial liver support system, the radial ﬂow bioreactor, the liver support system, the AMC-
bio-artiﬁcial liver, and the bio-artiﬁcial hepatic support system, all use porcine derived hepatocyte
cells (Demetriou et al., 2004; van de Kerkhove et al., 2004). However, there are concerns about
using tumor derived or transformed cells due to their potential to develop cancer. On the other hand,
porcine cells pose the risk of exposing the human body to animal tissue thus setting up an immune
response and the added risk of transporting infections from animals to humans. The widespread
452

clinical application of such systems is currently limited, although some of the bio-artiﬁcial liver
support systems have shown favorable clinical outcomes (Demetriou et al., 2004; van de Kerkhove
et al., 2004).
18.5
HEART AND LUNG MACHINE
A 20-year quest by John Gibbon realized the dream of building an artiﬁcial heart–lung machine,
which in turn allowed the ﬁeld of open heart surgery to bloom (Gibbon, 1954). The day was May 6,
1953, when thisdevicewas ﬁrstused torepair aholeintheupper chambers oftheheart.Since then,the
machine has undergone several changes (Boettcher et al., 2003) from the initial disc and screen
oxygenators to De Wall bubble oxygenators and ﬁnally to the membrane oxygenators (Cook, 2004).
The modern heart–lung machine consists essentially of a venous reservoir which drains venous blood
from the vena cava system. The blood is then pumped through a membrane oxygenator and subse-
quently pumped back into the aorta to support the circulation. There is a heat exchanger incorporated
in the circuit. Over the years various sensors and safety features have been added to this system,
although the basic design has remained the same for the last few decades (Boettcher et al., 2003).
The conventional bypass machine requires considerable priming ﬂuid which can lead to
signiﬁcant hemodilution. This in turn can have adverse effects on the functioning of the cellular
components of the blood. The large surface area initiates an immune systemic response. The latest
efforts have been to miniaturize the heart–lung machine (Boettcher et al., 2003; Remadi et al.,
2004; von Segesser et al., 2003).
The widespread use of the heart–lung machine has provided an opportunity for its use in heart
failure. The earlier attempts were to use the heart–lung machine for extended time to allow the heart
to recover (FC Spencer, 1959). But they had inherent problems associated with damage to the blood

Artiﬁcial Support and Replacement of Human Organs

due to the heart–lung machine. This necessitated a development of artiﬁcial ventricular assist
devices and total artiﬁcial heart to sustain the function of the heart (Deng et al., 2001; Portner,
2001). The application of the heart–lung machine also led to efforts at constructing an artiﬁcial
lung, which we will review prior to the ventricular assist devices and artiﬁcial heart.
18.6
ARTIFICIAL LUNG
The human lungs are essential in the oxygenation of blood. An artiﬁcial ventilator can supply the
oxygen in a controlled fashion to allow oxygenation in the lungs, and is used extensively during
surgeries and sometimes for prolonged ventilation. But patients with diseased lungs and failing
heart need extraordinarily high oxygen content and pressures to be maintained by the ventilators;
this itself can cause ﬁbrosis and destroy the lungs over time. The solution for these patients with
potentially reversible lung and cardiac failure is to achieve oxygenation of blood without exposing
the lungs to high ventilatory pressures and potentially toxic oxygen levels; this is particularly
important in children and neonates (Hansell, 2003; Lawson et al., 2004; Wolfson, 2003).
In 1955, Clowes and associates reported oxygen diffusion across plastic ﬁlms, which led to the
foundation for the later development of artiﬁcial lungs, more commonly called Extracorporeal
Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) (Clowes et al., 1955). One of the authors of this original
publication later reported the use of a silicone for membrane oxygenation; this is ﬁve times more
efﬁcient in carbon dioxide permeability compared to oxygen (Kolobow and Bowman, 1963). The
use of a silicone membrane allows a much smaller force for carbon dioxide transfer. The ECMO
interposes a semipermeable membrane of silicone between blood and oxygen, thus aiding gas
transfer. A traditional ECMO circuit drains the deoxygenated blood from the right side of heart, and
it is then pumped through a membrane oxygenator which allows the gas exchange to take place
(Cook, 2004; Hansell, 2003). The blood is then rewarmed and returned to the left side of the heart.
The transfer from and to the heart can be done by cannulating peripheral vessels such as the
internal jugular and carotid artery. The concerns about manipulating and ligating the carotid artery
led to a venovenous ECMO, in which a double lumen catheter does the job of taking blood from and
returning to the heart (Hansell, 2003).
In spite of earlier discouraging results, ECMO has proven to be a very useful tool in treating the
neonatal population needing cardio-respiratory support (Bartlett et al., 1976; Cook, 2004; Hansell,
2003; Petrou and Edwards, 2004). Its value in treating adults is currently limited. However, ECMO,
in a true sense does not replace the lungs but allows them to rest and recover, and hence is a
temporary substitute. Other systems such as hollow ﬁber systems have been used both clinically and
preclinically with good results. Microporous hollow ﬁber oxygenators are widely applied and are
popular for short-term cardiopulmonary bypass. Hollow ﬁber nonporous oxygenators are mostly
employed for long-term extracorporeal circulatory support. Unlike other organs there is no reliable
method available for bridging patients waiting for lung transplantation. Recent developments in
ﬂuid dynamics have allowed development of low-resistance membrane oxygenators (Figure
18.2). One such system relies on the pumping capacity of the right ventricle to sustain an artiﬁcial
lung oxygenator (Figure 18.3). Initial animal studies have been encouraging (Lick et al., 2001;
Zwischenberger et al., 2001). How this paracorporeal lung device will inﬂuence the treatment
of acute lung failure in the clinical setting is yet to be explored.
18.7
VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICES
The quest to support the function of the heart or to temporarily support it commenced soon after the
introduction of the Gibbon screen oxygenator (Gibbon, 1954). Earlier attempts employed the heart–
lung machine itself to support patients for extended period (FC Spencer, 1959). The ﬁrst ventricular
454
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

device was developed by DeBakey et al. in 1964 (DeBakey, 1971; Hall et al., 1964). Cooley made
an attempt to support the heart by one of the earlier artiﬁcial hearts as a bridge to transplant (Cooley
et al., 1969). Oyer was ﬁrst to successfully implant the Novacor device (Pierce, 1988). DeVries and
colleagues successfully implanted the Jarvik-7 model in Barney Clark (DeVries et al., 1984).
Pulsatility has been the main difference between the different devices, as one tries to mimic nature
by producing a beat with every ejection of the pump. These mechanical systems consist of the
pusher plate activated devices or compression of collapsible sacs by pneumatic power (Deng et al.,
2001; Portner, 2001). Nonpulsatile devices are essentially motor driven centrifugal pumps (Portner,
2001). Here we review some of the clinically used devices. All that the ventricular assist devices do
is to bypass the native heart; they do not replace the heart. The heart is kept in place, and the devices
merely bypass the blood ﬂow. The devices can either be connected with tubings to and from the

heart with the pump lying outside the body (centrifugal pumps and paracorporeal devices) or are
implantable in the body (intracorporeal). On the other hand, artiﬁcial hearts provide total replace-
ment of the heart, which is excised.
In the last few years, mechanical circulatory support has provided clinically relevant solutions
in the form of bridge to recovery, bridge to transplantation, and as a deﬁnitive therapy (Rose et al.,
2001). The rematch trial conclusively demonstrated beneﬁt with reduction of the mortality by 48%
in patients treated with devices versus those who received maximal medical management (Rose
et al., 2001). Patients in this study were ineligible for heart transplantation.
18.7.1
Centrifugal Pumps
Centrifugal pumps do not have valves or multiple moving or occluding parts; blood is pumped by
rotating blades or by use of impellers (Curtis et al., 1999). They are able to provide high ﬂow rates
with low pressure rises. There are various devices available; for example, BIO-PUMP (Medtronic,
Inc., Minneapolis, MN), St Jude pump (Bard Cardiopulmonary Division, Haverhill, MA), Carmeda
Bio-Pump (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), Sarns pump (3M Healthcare, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI),
Nikkiso pump (Nikkiso Pumps America, Inc., Plumsteadville, PA) (Curtis et al., 1994, 1996, 1999;
Magovern, 1993; Noon et al., 1995). The BioMedicus pump is depicted in Figure 18.4. One of the
disadvantages of centrifugal pumps is that they can only be used for short-term support of hours to
days (Hoy et al., 2000).
18.7.2
Paracorporeal Devices
Paracorporeal devices are placed outside the body and support each ventricle separately. For
example, the Abiomed BVS 500 is a pneumatically driven, asynchronous, pulsatile, polycarbonate
housed dual chamber pump (Dekkers et al., 2001; Wassenberg, 2000). During systole, compressed
air enters the ventricular chamber and compresses the polyurethane bladder. Another paracorporeal
device used clinically is the Thoratec VAD (Figure 18.5), which is also pneumatically driven
(Farrar, 2000; Farrar et al., 2002).
18.7.3
Intracorporeal Devices
These devices have the pump mechanism implanted in the body with power and driveline, being
connected to an external console. The HeartMate device is an implantable, pulsatile, pneumatically

actuated (IP) device (Frazier, 1994). The unit is made from sintered titanium and houses a ﬂexible,
textured polyurethane diaphragm and operated by a pusher plate mechanism. The newer electrically
vented model is HeartMate VE (Figure 18.6) and which was introduced in 1991 (Frazier et al.,
2001). This latter unit is composed of textured titanium, incorporating titanium microspheres; the
polyurethane diaphragm specially treated with textured polyurethane, encouraging deposition of
ﬁbrin–collagen matrix, and is more biocompatible with reduced need for anticoagulation (Morgan
et al., 2004; Rose et al., 2001). Novacor LVAS (World Heart Corp., Ottawa, Canada) incorporates a
dual pusher-plate sac type pump, with a smooth blood contacting surface (Di Bella et al., 2000;
Robbins et al., 2001). The system uses a high efﬁciency linear motor, with a pulsed solenoid energy
converter with a two armature assembly (Figure 18.7). This system requires no gears, cams, or
intermediate hydraulic conversion; theoretically, it has advantage of low mechanical failure. The
advantage of the LionHeart LVAS (Arrow International, Reading, Pennsylvania) is that it is
completely implantable; it has a brushless motor which actuates a pusher plate using a roller and
screw mechanism (El-Banayosy et al., 2003; Mehta et al., 2001). Energy transfer through the chest
wall is achieved using radiofrequency induction (Figure 18.8).
18.7.4
Newer Rotary Axial Pumps
In order to overcome the disadvantages offered by the various paracorporeal and intracorporeal
devices such as external drivelines and the large consoles, the radial axial ﬂow devices were
devised (Kung and Hart, 1997; Nose, 1998; Okada et al., 1997; Wu et al., 1999). These devices
have only one moving part and hence are smaller in size with less need for energy (Mesana, 2004;
Nose et al., 2000). There are, however, some inherent problems associated with the simplicity of the
design. For example, the absence of a valve can result in signiﬁcant backﬂow with device failure,
which can be detrimental in an already diseased heart. There are also concerns about the very high
speeds at which axial pumps rotate and some aspects regarding bio-compatibility are still open to
question (Mesana, 2004). The three systems which are clinically used include: (1) DeBakey VAD
(MicroMed Technology, Inc, Houston, Texas), a small 30-mm diameter device, 76 mm in length,
which weighs 95 gm (Figure 18.9) and is made of titanium (Goldstein, 2003; Noon et al., 2001);
(2) The Flowmaker (Jarvik 2000), (Jarvik Heart, Inc., New York, NY) titanium based pump, which
is 25 mm in diameter, 51 mm in length and weighs 90 gm (Frazier et al., 2004; Kaplon et al., 1996);
and (3) HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp., Pleasanton, CA), which has a diameter of 40 mm, length of
70 mm and weighs 176 gm (Figure 18.10) (Burke et al., 2001; Grifﬁth et al., 2001).
All these devices work on similar principle and are composed of an impeller and inducer
assembly with blood lubricated bearings. In spite of their perceived shortcomings, these devices
offer the advantages of small size and potential for a destination therapy for heart failure.

Some of the newer magnetically levitated centrifugal pumps like HeartQuest VAD (MedQuest

LVAS (Arrow Intl.) (Figure 18.11) (Doi et al., 2004) offer the similar advantages as above and are
in the early stages of clinical investigation.

TOTAL ARTIFICIAL HEART
The era of total artiﬁcial heart replacement began in 1958 with the successful sustenance of
circulation of a dog for 90 min by Akustu and Kolff (1958). This was followed by the implantation
of the Liotta heart by Cooley in 1969 (Cooley et al., 1969) and the Akutsu III heart in 1981 (Frazier

et al., 1982); both had unfavorable outcome. It was in 1982 that the Jarvik-7 total artiﬁcial heart
(TAH) was implanted in Barney Clark by DeVries and colleagues (DeVries et al., 1984). This
operation attracted much public attention as a result of signiﬁcant coverage in the lay media. The
New York Times went as far as calling this a ‘‘Dracula’’ of medical therapy. The following devices
are some of the clinically available TAH which have been used.
18.8.1
AbioCor Total Artiﬁcial Heart (ABIOMED, Inc, Denver, CO)
This device is composed of a high efﬁciency miniature centrifugal pump situated between the two
artiﬁcial ventricles; this system is implanted after removing the native heart. A two position
switching valve is used to alternate the direction of the hydraulic ﬂow between the pumping
chambers resulting in alternate contraction of the chambers (Dowling et al., 2001, 2003). In
addition, there is a balance chamber which balances the volume between right and left sided
chambers. This device is in the initial clinical trial stage and at the time this publication went to
press, 15 patients have undergone device implantation.
18.8.2
CardioWest TAH (SynCardia Systems, Inc, Tucson, AZ)
This device is a precursor of the Jarvik-7. It is a pneumatically driven biventricular pulsatile
device (Figure 18.12) (Leprince et al., 2003). Blood collects in to a polyurethane blood sac and is
compressed by the air (Copeland, 2000; Copeland et al., 2001). There are two artiﬁcial
ventricles which are connected to the native atria. An external console delivers the compressed air.
18.8.3
Penn State TAH (ABIOMED, Inc, Denver, CO)
This device is an electromechanical TAH and consists of a titanium rigid case with blood sacs and
energy converters. The energy converter is a brushless DC electric motor. The actuation moves dual
pusher plates to both sides by a roller screw. It has low associated vibrations and minimal noise
(Weiss et al., 1999). It has a stroke volume of about 64 ml and can reach a maximum output of about
8 l/min. This device is in the preclinical testing stage.

TOTAL JOINT REPLACEMENTS
Attempts have been made since decades to ﬁnd a cure for the treatment of arthritis which affects
mainly the hip and knee joints. Earlier treatments included fusion of joint spaces (arthrodesis),
removing some part of bone (osteotomy), disrupting the nerve supply and cleaning (de´bridement)
of the joint spaces to remove the irregular coverings over the bone in the joints. In an attempt to
smoothen the joint spaces, calcium deposits, parts of cartilage, and extraneous bony spurs were
removed. Attempts were made to cover the joint spaces with fat, muscle, fascia, or metals like
gold, magnesium, and zinc. These strategies had limited success, and they proved short lived at
the best. Smith Peterson in 1925 in Boston proposed using a glass molding of the ball of the hip
joint to reduce friction (Neff, 1954). However, it was soon apparent that glass could not withstand
the stress of the normal body weight in the erect posture. Other materials like plastics and
stainless steel were tried, and steel was proven to be biocompatible. Other material used was
cobalt–chromium to allow a resistant free joint movement; this met with some mixed success.
Austin Moore and Frederick Thompson independently demonstrated the feasibility of replacing
the entire ball of the hip, but this only addressed the problems of the arthritic femoral head, since
the hip socket (acetabulum) was not replaced.
In 1938, Jean Judet and his brother used acrylic material to replace the hip surfaces; although
unsuccessful initially due to the limited adhesiveness offered by acrylic, this was the precursor for
using the dental fast setting acrylic in joint replacement (Lukes and Merckelbach, 1958). John
Charnley is credited with using polyethylene to create the hip joint socket and used to achieve a
smooth surface between the metal ball component and the new socket, which was cemented using
polymethyl acrylate (Mallory, 2004). This essentially established the ﬁeld of total hip replacement
(Wroblewski, 2004). Around 100,000 hip replacements are performed annually in the United
States. The aspect of breakdown in the cement ﬁxation has been the area of intense research in
Figure 18.12 (See color insert following page 302)

the recent years, and implants with textured surfaces have been developed in an effort to allow bone
to grow into the implant, this theoretically has the advantage of allowing much stronger biological
cementing. One of the long-term problems after hip replacement is loosening of the components,
which can result in bone loss and pain. This restricts the use of total hip replacement among
younger patients. This happens due to very small plastic particles produced by the wearing of the
cup. Recently metal on metal joints have regained popularity and are particularly suited for the hip
joint replacement in middle age patients since it gives a much longer lasting results compared to the
other hip replacements (Dorr et al., 2000).
Parallel developments allowed the development of total knee replacement. Initial attempts were
to replace the joint cavity with hinges which can cover the joint space to reduce friction. But
problems with loosening and infection frequently occurred. Frank Gunston developed a metal on
plastic knee replacement joint in 1968 (Gunston, 1971). A three component knee-joint prosthesis
was proposed by John Insall in 1972 which covered the femur, tibia, and the patella, and were held
in place using cement (Ranawat et al., 1975). This has resulted in the development of the modern
knee-joint prosthesis. Currently more than 150,000 knee-joint replacements are undertaken in
United States alone (Noble et al., 2005). Similar to the hip prosthesis, attempts have been underway
in recent years to achieve a cementless joint replacement, using biological ability to glue these
components together by allowing new bone growth in the roughened surfaces of these devices,
which then can give strength and eliminate the need for artiﬁcial gluing materials that could come
loose.
18.10
BIO-ARTIFICIAL PANCREAS
Long standing diabetes mellitus (types I and II) results due to the inability of the pancreas to secrete
insulin. Therapy has been focused at administering the insulin exogenously to achieve acceptable
blood sugar levels, however, it is often difﬁcult to manage. Transplantation of the isolated islet cells
(which secrete insulin) although promising is limited due to the associated need for immunosup-
pression and limited organ supply.
Devices such as microencapsulated islets (small diameter spherical chamber), and microencap-
sulated islets (including hollow ﬁber, disk-shaped diffusion chambers and Millipore cellulose
membranes) have been proposed (Lanza et al., 1992; Lim and Sun, 1980; Reach et al., 1981;
Sullivan et al., 1991). Advancements in glucose sensing and insulin sensing technology have
allowed developing automated closed loop insulin delivery systems that can deliver insulin in a
more physiologic way. One such system currently undergoing clinical trials is a diffusion chamber
for a bio-artiﬁcial endocrine pancreas (Bio-AEP), which is constructed by placing pancreatic islet
cells, trapped in a scaffold; this is sandwiched between semipermeable membranes, and shielded by
silicone (Hirotani et al., 1999). Although some of the results achieved in animal studies have been
difﬁcult to reproduce in large animal models, this therapy holds promise for the future treatment of
diabetes mellitus.
18.11
VISUAL PROSTHESIS (ARTIFICIAL EYE)
The understanding of the mammalian visual system has given impetus for conceptualizing an
artiﬁcial visual prosthesis that can be used in the profoundly blind. The goal of these systems is to
produce a visual perception to allow activities like reading, recognizing shapes and faces, negoti-
ating complex spaces, and giving the perception of light surroundings. This is dealt with in greater
detail in Chapters 11 and 17.

18.12
ARTIFICIAL SKIN SUBSTITUTES
Successful application of skin substitutes has been applied widely in the clinical ﬁeld for a few
decades now. The development of skin substitutes or artiﬁcial skin began with growing sheets of
cells in culture media and has progressed to developing complex structures with bi-layered skin that
mimics the human skin. A deeper dermal element is constructed using synthetic epidermis.
Currently there are three approaches used for manufacturing artiﬁcial skin, the gel approach where
cells are grown in a gel of extracellular material like collagen; the scaffold approach where porous
scaffolds created from collagen or synthetic material are used to allow cells to be seeded subse-
quently (Jones et al., 2002); the third approach entails, self-assembly, it is still in animal testing
stage and has to await clinical application.
Some of the artiﬁcial skin substitutes available are, Alloderm1 introduced in market in 1992
and is based on treating fresh cadaver skin in which the epidermal layer is removed and cellular
components are destroyed (Bello et al., 2001). The freeze drying of this skin substitute renders it
immunologically inert and hence is not rejected by the recipient (Losee et al., 2005; Terino, 2001).
Integray approved in 1996 by FDA is another skin substitute available commercially and is made
from cellular collagen and glycosaminoglycans matrix (Winfrey et al., 1999). The dermal compon-
ent is made of collagen and the epidermal element is substituted by synthetic silicon. Dermagraft1 is
an allogenic dermal substitute, it comprises of a scaffold of polyglactin seeded with allogenic
ﬁbroblasts (Eaglstein, 1998). This is now used to treat skin ulcers and burn wounds. Another
allogenic frozen dermal substitute is TransCyte1, which is used as a temporary replacement for
wounds and burns (Noordenbos et al., 1999). It is created by seeding ﬁbroblasts into a scaffold made
from nylon mesh and silicone sheet. Bilayered substitutes are composed of allogenic keratinocytes
seeded on a nonporous collagen gel and covered with a bovine collagen scaffold containing
ﬁbroblasts (OrCel1). They offer the more biologically mimicking skin substitute (Still et al., 2003).
18.13
ARTIFICIAL BLOOD
Inadequate oxygen delivery to the tissues is common sequelae when signiﬁcant blood loss occurs
due to trauma or surgery. This is commonly treated in clinical practice by administering donated
human blood. However, the availability of donors and the risk of transmission of infections limit this
approach. Fatal reactions can occur due to a mismatch or presence of antibodies in the blood of the
recipient; in addition, repeated blood transfusions can depress the immune function in the host. This
is one of the reasons why an artiﬁcial blood substitute is highly desirable since it can avoid these
complications. Two main approaches are used for achieving an artiﬁcial blood substitute, bio-
artiﬁcial oxygen carriers and totally synthetic oxygen carriers. Bio-artiﬁcial oxygen carriers are
hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers and use human, animal, or recombinant hemoglobin. Synthetic
oxygen carriers use metal chelates that mimic the hemoglobin’s oxygen binding capacity. Artiﬁcial
ﬂuorinated organic compounds can physically dissolve large amounts of oxygen, perﬂurocarbon-
based oxygen carriers are commonly employed for this purpose. However, in a strict sense they
constitute oxygen carrier substitutes and not blood substitutes since they lack the coagulation
factors and immune cells ﬁghting infection that are essential in aiding coagulation and clot
formation and ﬁghting infection, which can be vital in the patients receiving these therapies.
Examples of bio-artiﬁcial oxygen carriers include modiﬁed human or animal hemoglobin-based
carriers, stabilized hemoglobin tetramers, polymerized hemoglobin, conjugated hemoglobin, and
liposome encapsulated hemoglobin. Other carriers also include recombinant hemoglobin or from
transgenic studies. Synthetic oxygen carriers include lipid–heme vesicles, hemoglobin aquasoms, and
perﬂurocarbonbasedcarriers.Moredetailedreviewispresentedelsewhere(KimandGreenburg,2004).

18.14
OTHER SUBSTITUTES
The last few decades have seen an explosive growth in the development of various implants
such as pacemakers, stents for the arteries, cochlear implants (Rubinstein, 2004) to improve
hearing, apheresis, small joints for the ﬁngers and other joints, etc., the list is quite long and
a brief review like this is unable to cover these areas in detail. Another ﬁeld that is currently
undergoing intense research is the ﬁeld of xenotransplantation. Theoretically, this should allow
transplantation of organs from animals to humans; however, there are several issues which need to
be addressed include the risk of transmission of animal diseases to humans, the altered immune
response that may accompany the species speciﬁc difference (Hammer, 2004; Schmidt et al., 2004).
18.15
LIMITATIONS OF THE CURRENT ORGAN REPLACEMENT SYSTEMS
In spite of the signiﬁcant advances made in the development of the artiﬁcial organs, some common
problems plague all the systems. Biocompatibility (Hernandez et al., 2004; Jalan et al., 2004) is still
a major problem, necessitating heparinization to avoid thrombosis. The use of heparin, to combat
thrombosis, puts the patient at risk of bleeding-associated complications (Boyle et al., 2004;
Minami et al., 2000; Rose et al., 2001). The organ systems do not truly replace the organs except
in the case of total artiﬁcial heart. Most of the systems work on the principle of passive transport as
in artiﬁcial kidney, artiﬁcial liver, and lung and hence fail to mimic the physiological functions of
these individual organs.
Most of these systems expose the body to increased infection risk due to the various lines and
ports used for access (Rose et al., 2001; Tobin and Bambauer, 2003). This risk of infection can be
serious in an already sick group of patients (El-Banayosy et al., 2001; Minami et al., 2000). Other
limitations include nonphysiological support; for example, the organ support in case of kidneys
need not be continuous as is the case of normal kidney which carries out the work 24 h a day, and
this can disturb the delicate physiological balance necessary for the optimum biological function-
ing. Mobility is restricted in all types of the support devices.
The issue of energy supply is very important in the case of artiﬁcial ventricular assist devices
and the artiﬁcial heart; these devices need to work continuously and lack of back-up systems can
be catastrophic (Portner, 2001). Mechanical failure is an important issue if long term support is
envisaged.
18.15.1
Impact of Other Technologies
Technological advances are rapidly taking place around us and it is natural that these will
signiﬁcantly affect future organ support systems. The current organ replacement systems were
designed in the 1960s and 1970s; it is a natural evolutionary step that new technology will replace
the older systems.
In concluding this section, we will take a glimpse at current developmental research in related
ﬁelds and how it will impact the future of organ replacement systems.
18.15.1.1 Tissue Engineering
Tissue engineering is a science that uses living cells combined with biomaterials for diagnostic and
therapeutic purposes. This involves generation of cells, tissues, and complex organoid structures
in the laboratory to replace natural organ function partially or completely (Fuchs et al., 2001).
Application of tissue engineering has resulted in the development of bio-artiﬁcial kidney
(Aebischer et al., 1987), liver (Chamuleau, 2002; Kulig et al., 2004), tissue-engineered heart
valves (Hoerstrup et al., 2000a,b; Stock et al., 2002) and generation of myocardial cells to treat
464
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

heart failure (Thompson et al., 2003). From the initial euphoria in 1990 to disappointment in 2004,
tissue engineering has been put to test; a number of products have not shown beneﬁt in clinical
trials, that in turn is reﬂected in the lack of market interest in these products (Lysaght and Reyes,
2001; Lysaght and Hazlehurst, 2004).
Tissue engineering has the necessary potential of seeding appropriate scaffolding with cells of
interest as in the case of tubule cells used in artiﬁcial kidney (Fey-Lamprecht et al., 2003; Humes,
2000; Ozgen et al., 2004). As our understanding increases in terms of cell growth characteristics in
relation to biomaterials, we are likely to move towards bio-artiﬁcial organ replacement systems.
Normal organs, however, are composed of many different cell types with complex messaging and
interactions. Using a single cell type may not necessarily guarantee adequate functioning of such
systems. The importance of developing appropriate scaffolds for the blood vessels to grow can be
key to future development of solid organs (Kaihara et al., 2000; MacNeill et al., 2002). The current
systems use altered cancerous cells or cells from animal origin, which raises the likelihood of risk of
cancerous transformation and transmission of animal originated diseases (van de Kerkhove et al.,
2004). However, using adult stem cells from the patients’ own bone marrow may be the solution
which will be more widely applied in the future.
18.15.1.2 Stem Cell Technology
Stem cells are the precursor cells from which any type of cell differentiation is possible (Jain,
2002). There are two types of stem cell sources that can be used, one from the embryonic stage
and another from the adult stem cells within the bone marrow. Stem cells from the embryonic stage
offer the characteristic of differentiating into any possible cell type (Kakinuma et al., 2003; Sukhikh
and Shtil, 2002); but recent ﬁndings, however, of increasing plasticity shown by the human
hematopoietic stem cells to differentiate into different cell types has led to interest in developing
them as a cell therapy for organ failure (Liu et al., 2004a–c; Schuster et al., 2004; Strom et al., 2004;
Yokoo et al., 2003).
18.15.1.3 Impact of Understanding the Human Genome
The human genome sequence now has been decoded (Venter et al., 2001). This offers the potential
of synthetic DNA which can create proteins of interest. Theoretically, this can be used to develop
synthetic organ systems and conceivably a complete organism. However, there are several limita-
tions to this concept since we still do not have the insight into the function and role of all the human
genes. Early indications suggest a possibility of tailor-made treatment based on the individual
patient’s genomic characteristics; how this will apply to the treatment and replacement of organ
systems remains to be fully explored.
18.15.1.4 Microelectromechanical Systems
Microdevices have been applied for certain diagnostic, therapeutic, and selected surgical proced-
ures (Evans et al., 2003; Polla et al., 2000; Richards Grayson et al., 2004). Microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS) employ the same manufacturing methods as silicone chips for computer industry.
They can be a useful tool for rapid screening of diseases, measurement of blood levels of hormones
and drugs, targeted drug delivery, and novel micro-stimulators in neurosciences (Evans et al., 2003;
Huang et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2004a–c; Polla et al., 2000; Roy et al., 2001).
What makes MEMS more promising is the building of small rotors capable of running on
miniscule energy (Epstein and Senturia, 1997; Miki et al., 2003). These have enormous potential
to provide the energy source for organ replacement systems. In addition, they can provide the
capability to detect the minute changes in hormones and endorphins on which the response of the
organ support system can be tailored.

18.15.2
Nanotechnology and Biomimetics
Living organisms are the perfect example of the advanced nanotechnological manufacturing by
nature. What could be more interesting than trying to build artiﬁcial organs from the beginning and
mimicking nature?
Advances in the development of artiﬁcial organs to date have relied mainly on supplanting
the function of an organ with an alternative process. As in the case of heart, it is the pumping
mechanism, in lungs the oxygenation of the blood, and in liver and kidney, the removal of harmful
wastes. But biological organs play even more complex and dynamic role in the physiological mileu
in terms of metabolic and other organ function. The biofeedback in these natural organs takes place
at nano-dimensions, which the present replacement systems are unable to mimic precisely enough
to bring about changes in the functionality of the devices.
Nanotechnology can provide molecularly manipulated nanostructured materials which will
mimic the natural surfaces. Sensing and control can be achieved in these systems using microelec-
tronics and novel interface technologies (Lee et al., 2004). Drug delivery systems at nanoscale can
maintain the function of normal cells (Prokop, 2001). Molecular self-assembly can simulate the
surface geometry by polymeric patterning; since this has immense importance in the behavior of the
individual cell and cell to cell communication, adhesion and migration (Chaikof et al., 2002; Hilt,
2004). Current cell and tissue culture systems fail to mimic the natural processes that provide
extracellular matrix. Extracellular matrix plays an important role in the repair processes and thus
inﬂuences cell behavior and survival. Scaffolds at a micro-level can be created using nanotechnol-
ogy, and can incorporate the extracellular matrix containing glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins
supporting cell growth and proliferation (Bouhadir et al., 2001; Chaikof et al., 2002).
The advances in nanotechnology allow us to synthesize novel materials, fabricate them in two or
three-dimensional forms as scaffolds and allow the growth of new cells and ultimately whole
organs (Chaikof et al., 2002; Karlsson et al., 2004; Moldovan and Ferrari, 2002).
The National Institute of Health (NIH) has taken a big initiative in funding nanomedicine-
related research and development. The NIH roadmap aims to have applications in drug delivery,
cell repair, anticancer methodologies, and biomachines that could remove and replace a damaged
cell or tissue. The biggest advantage of nanotechnology will be in understanding the organ function
at minute levels and creating bio-engineered cells and tissues capable of replacing human organs.
Structural and functional creation of artiﬁcial organs using nanotechnology will need precise
understanding of the structure and function of the organ; the current knowledge of anatomical
structures can greatly help in this regard. This can allow bioengineers to create exact scaffolds for
the blood vessels and cells to grow. The issue of energy source can only be solved, however, if
micro-machines are built which can derive energy from oxygen, glucose and other substances that
are easily available in the body.
18.16
SUMMARY
The current emphasis on replacement by mechanical systems is already profoundly affected
by newer technologies. In the future, bio-compatible surfaces will be designed keeping in
mind the precise interactions at atomic and molecular levels rather than the trial-and-error approach
that was adopted several decades ago. These newer technologies will deﬁnitely have an impact on
future artiﬁcial medical implants, be it artiﬁcial heart valves, vascular conduits, or artiﬁcial organ
systems.
Design and technology will certainly move to center stage in the coming years. Unique
problems will be posed for the today’s scientists, physicians, and engineers, who are slow to adjust
to collaborative research. Current funding structure is limited in supporting such collaborations; the
cost of such design and manufacturing will be prohibitive for one group or individual organizations

to sustain. Answers to these problems will hopefully be addressed in the future federal funding
mechanism as outlined in the initiative by NIH on nanotechnology.
One of the questions that is frequently debated is whether future organ replacement technology
will involve miniaturizing the current systems or building newer organ replacement systems
from scratch. As outlined above, current organ replacement systems have several disadvantages
which will be difﬁcult to overcome even if they are miniaturized. Miniaturization will certainly
play an important role in devising therapeutic interventions such as drug delivery. Devising
organ replacement systems from scratch will help address the current problems of biocompati-
bility and better mimic the organ function at cellular level. This will involve creating novel
anatomical models of scaffoldings which are biocompatible and bioactive to allow cell growth
and differentiation so that complex organs can be developed. Such new organ systems will need
to produce energy from oxygen, glucose, and other substances freely available in the blood and be
self-sufﬁcient.
How far we are from the reality of buying off-the-shelf artiﬁcial organs? May be in next 10
years? As the pace of developments in the ﬁelds of nanotechnology, tissue engineering, and others
is accelerating, the reality of having a self-sustaining artiﬁcial organ replacement system is a
possible reality in the upcoming years.

INTRODUCTION
In the preface to his 1992 popular book Exploring Biomechanics, R. McNeill Alexander reﬂected
that ‘‘one of the liveliest and most fascinating branches of biomechanics is the study of animal
locomotions.’’ In this chapter, we hope to show that nastic movements in plants are just as intriguing
and reveal design principles that are uniquely ﬁtted to the sessile lifestyle of plants and to the many
challenges encountered by human engineering. This expectation may be surprising if we conﬁne
our considerations to the free movement of entire individuals (locomotion). Higher plants are rooted
and migrate only as seeds dispersed by wind and animals. Only the climbing seedlings of one higher
plant — the parasitic dodder in the genus Cuscuta — have shown that they can actively change their
individual location by abandoning and regrowing root and root-like haustoria.
However, translocation of individuals occurs frequently in some developmental stages of lower
plants and in motile single-celled and multicellular algae. Botanists call this type of individual
473

movement taxis or tactic movement. Depending on the type of activating stimuli, such as light, ions,
sugars, or hormones, and electric ﬁelds we ﬁnd directed translocations in the form of phototactic,
chemotactic, or even galvanotactic movements. The direction of the response to the triggering
stimulus is indicated by a positive or negative sign, for example, a single green alga moving
towards a light source carry out a positive phototactic move whereas light avoidance is referred to
as negative phototaxis. In higher plants, we ﬁnd positive chemotaxis in fern sperms, which respond
to a malate signal from unfertilized archegonia. Similarly, pollen tubes change their direction of
growth towards a calcium or hormone signal from unfertilized ovules. Whether the last example
should be referred to as a tactic movement is disputable, since only the internal part of the original
organism — the pollen grain — is moving.
The locomotion of entire large organisms can be viewed as a zoological specialization that
derived from organ movements. It was useful only for the evolution of animals to coordinate these
organ movements with a purpose to translocate the entire organism as a unit. Primarily, both animals
and plants show only autonomous movements of their organs whether these are leaves, ﬂower parts,
tendrils, legs, wings, or ﬁns. In plants, there are two types of organ movements; tropisms and nastic
movements. Tropisms are based on an induced difference in the irreversible expansion between two
ﬂanks of a growing plant organ that cause the organ to bend and adopt a new direction of growth.
Accordingly, tropisms are growth responses that respond to the direction of the triggering stimuli.
Stimuli, such as light, gravity, hormones, mechanical stimulation, and electric ﬁelds induce directed
responses in the form of phototropic, gravitropic, chemotropic, seismotropic, and galvanotropic
curvatures. A well-known example for positive gravitropism is the growth of the main root towards
the earth’s center of gravity. Negative gravitropism is the response that leads a growing organ away
from the earth’s center of gravity and appears, for example, in the vertical reerection of trampled or
fallen plants. Since tropistic changes in growth direction are caused by different expansion rates on
the opposite ﬂanks of plant organs, they resemble monomorph and bimorph actuators. Contrasting to
tropisms are organ movements that are independent from the direction of the inducing stimulus, for
example, raising and lowering of leaves, folding and unfolding of leaves, opening and closure of the
Venus ﬂytrap. This second type of organ movement is called nastic. Like before, with tactic and
tropistic movements we can also specify photonastic, seismonastic, and chemonastic movements.
Nastic movements are often reversible and deﬁned by joint-like structures that conﬁne their mobility
options. Although these characteristics are shared by many human-made machines, we will ﬁnd
nastic motors and structures to be uniquely arranged.
In engineering terms, plants are adaptive (smart) structures with remarkable capabilities that
were developed and perfected over millions of years of evolution in constantly changing and
increasingly complex environments. It is therefore smart to study, understand, mimic, and modify
nature’s time-tested principles and mechanisms. Life originated in water, and nastic structures as
well as their motors are optimized to use the potentialities of this unique solvent. In addition to
ATP-dependent molecular motors, contracting and inﬂating molecules, such as the P-protein in the
phloem conduits, plants rely heavily on three hydration motors (osmotic, colloidal, and ﬁbrous) that
ﬁgure as the major workhorses for nastic plant movements. After examining the three major types
of plant motors, we will review selected examples for their action in simple and then more complex
nastic structures.
19.2
MOTORS IN NATURE’S NASTIC DESIGNS
When exploring the designs of moving things, one usually starts with the force-generating units or
motors. Animal locomotion involves molecular motors called muscles, which consist of long
ﬁber cells with the ability to contract. With an almost ubiquitous force of contraction of about
30 g mm2, muscles develop their strength in pull but not in push. It follows that they must operate
any reversible joint in antagonistic pairs attached to different locations of the relevant bone levers.
474
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

To increase speed, muscles can slowly tension elastic polymers like resilin and elastin that can
release the stored energy much more rapidly (Alexander, 1992). To increase muscle strength,
animals can only increase the cross-sectional area by bundling the ﬁbers in thicker and longer
fascicles. Only engineering is able to amplify force beyond this natural limit by combining
elementary machines (lever, wedge, inclined plane, pulley, wheel, and screw) in devices like
cranking wheels, compound pulleys, and hydraulic ampliﬁers.
Although plants possess similar molecular motors as animals (cytoplasmic streaming and pollen
tube movement use actin-based myosin motors, while cytokinetic chromosome movements use
microtubule-based kinesin motors), these remain conﬁned to movements inside cells and do not
play a causal role in the macroscopic movements of plant organs (Asada and Collings, 1997;
Shimmen et al., 2000). Only animals have adopted molecular motors to drive their macro-
movements by an energy-consuming cell contraction. In these movements, motor elements
(muscles) are external to the moving parts (bones). Plants use hydration motors to drive their
macro-movements and here the motors are an inconspicuous, integrated part of the structure. Plant
cells differ from those of animals in their ability to undergo multifold expansions by the ability to
incorporate large amounts of water into a special organelle, the vacuole. Consequently, nastic
motors extract work from a change in hydration pressure. Their operation differs not only from
muscles but also from related technical, that is, hydraulic designs and is for this reason alone
worthwhile reviewing. Moreover, plant motors generally power autonomous movements that are
locally controlled and operate without remote control through central nervous systems or computers.
19.2.1
Osmotic Motors
Hydraulic motors and actuators work on the basis of a change in hydrostatic pressure. In animals
and human-made designs this is achieved by muscles and mechanical pumps that subject water to
pressure. Plant osmotic motors are different. Rather than compressing the water directly, plants
generate hydrostatic pressure by injecting solutes into a conﬁned space that must be surrounded by
a selective membrane that retains the solutes but allows water to permeate freely into this space.
Osmosis therefore requires two components: a semipermeable membrane inside to concentrate the
solutes and a restraining, but elastic and expandable wall outside to prevent the compartment from
bursting when water is taken up during the hydration of these solutes. The hydration of the solutes
generates hydrostatic pressure inside the osmotic compartments. All plants use osmosis to pump
and concentrate water-binding electrolytes and nonelectrolytes into the inside of their cells and in
particular into the vacuole, a membrane-surrounded compartment speciﬁcally designed for storing
solutes and water. Osmotically operating plant cells allow the build-up of internal pressures far
exceeding that of car tires.
The accurateness of this principle was ﬁrst demonstrated by a model ingeniously devised by
Traube; an artiﬁcial cell consisting of a porous clay cylinder covered with a copper ferrocyanide
membrane permeable only for the small water molecules. The combination of this device with a
manometer allowed the experimental determination of osmotic pressure values for a variety of
concentrations and solutes (Pfeffer, 1873). The model allowed Pfeffer to predict the existence and
properties of membranes too thin to be visible in the light microscopes of his time. Pfeffer’s
osmometer was the ﬁrst truly man-made osmotic motor, one of the earliest biomimetic designs and
instrumental for a breakthrough in the biology of ion and water transport.
The internal cell pressure of plant cells can be determined with external solutions of an equal or
higher osmotic pressure that draw water from the cells, relieve the internal pressure so that the cell
membranes are no longer closely pressed against the cell wall but separate from it; a process called
plasmolysis. Internal cell pressures can reach up to 5 MPa in storage roots of sugar beets and in the
shoots of some halophytic and xerophytic desert plants (Walter, 1953). As in human-made
inﬂatable structures (e.g., sleeping bags) pressurization of the cells leads to the expansion as well
as stiffening and hydrostatic stabilization of the cells, tissues, and entire structures (e.g., Niklas,
Nastic Structures: The Enacting and Mimicking of Plant Movements
475

1992). To prevent an explosive rupture of the membranes, the huge pressures have to be counter-
balanced by strong but ﬂexible cell walls made of cellulose and other polymers. However, when
considering mobile, nastic structures, the walls must have also the ability to yield to the pressure
and so to allow plastic and elastic expansion. Not all cell expansions are driven by the pressure of
vacuolar osmotic motors though. The 15-fold volume increase in root cap cells occurs without the
formation and expansion of a large vacuole and — at least in part — is likely to be driven by a
colloid motor (Juniper and Clowes, 1965).
The osmotic motor is the most common of the three types of hydration motors used by plants.
Some plant species can also use osmosis to pump water and solutes into the upper shoot, an action
that becomes necessary when a highly humid air prevents normal ion transport by transpiration.
Pumping ions into the xylem vessels of the lower end of the root cylinder, roots generate a local
pressure increase of up to 0.1 MPa sufﬁcient to push a water column 9 to 10 m above the ground.
This so-called root pressure is generated by only some plant species and becomes apparent in such
phenomena like guttation (the appearance of droplets at the leaf periphery of grasses and broad-
leafed plants) and the so-called bleeding of decapitated stumps (e.g., Stahlberg and Cosgrove,
1997).
Osmotic motors have the disadvantages that they depend on the intactness of a very thin, fragile
membrane that also must be permeable to the small water molecules alone. Freezing and subse-
quent thawing destroy these membranes and with it all osmosis-based mechanisms. The same
failure occurs when the ionic solutions are so severely dehydrated that they crystallize. The
shrinking of osmotically operating vacuoles that often occupy more than 90% of the cell volume
leads to harmful structural deformations of tissues (exceptions are discussed in Section 19.2.2.4).
Some plants, for example, in the genus Selaginella, can repeatedly dry and rehydrate without
structural damage. They avoid critical cell deformations during severe dehydration by using
vacuoles of smaller size that are ﬁlled with tannin colloids instead of ions. Upon dehydration
these colloids undergo minimal volume changes (Walter, 1956). Nature itself points here to the
interesting alternative of replacing crystallizing small molecules with larger-sized colloids.
19.2.2
Colloid-Based Motors
Colloids are hydrating particles with a size ranging from 5 nm to 0.5 mm. Most colloids do not form
true solutions but suspensions that are not completely transparent and show light diffraction
(Tyndall effects) and other optical effects not found in true solutions. Many natural macromol-
ecules, such as starch, pectins, latex, nucleic acids, and proteins, ﬁt this deﬁnition. Due to their
larger particle size, colloidal solutions cannot be as concentrated as osmotic solutions and their
osmotic effect is therefore considerably smaller. This is demonstrated in the following comparison.
A 10% (w/v) solution of glucose has an osmotic pressure of 1.35 MPa whereas a 10% solution of
the colloidal bovine serum albumin (BSA, a soluble protein) has only 3.2 kPa, that is, it is
osmotically almost three orders of magnitude less effective (Levitt, 1969).
For the purpose of constructing a colloid-based motor, there are primarily three desirable
characteristics of colloids: (i) the potential expandability, that is, the volume change they undergo
per volume absorbed water; (ii) the reversibility of the volume change; (iii) a low hydraulic
capacitance, deﬁned as the volume change per unit applied pressure (Meidner and Sheriff, 1976).
A high force development per volume change is desirable for any motor and leads to the practical
question for both nature and human engineers of whether colloid-based motors can equal the
generated pressures of osmotically operating systems like vacuoles ﬁlled with ionic solutes. Natural
macromolecules bind water to different degrees, for example, 1 g of starch binds 0.8 g water. Due to
high particle size and molecular weight, colloid hydration looks more impressive if we express
it as the binding of 30,000 to 100,000 water molecules per molecule gelatin (Walter, 1957). This
high degree of hydration is not osmotic but due to the presence of adsorptive forces (called adhesion
or imbibition) that can equal and exceed the pressure of osmotic systems by reaching values of up to
476
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

100 MPa. Due to internal adsorption, the volume increase of colloidal systems is smaller than the
volume the adsorbed water occupies in its free form. Note also that the response of colloid-based
hydration motors is not limited to water alone but can also be strongly affected by the concentration
of Ca2þ, ATP, temperature, and pH (Pollack, 2004). This is one reason to consider colloid-based
hydration motors as more promising for biomimetic designs than osmotic motors.
Water-soluble proteins (albumins and globulins) from seeds are well-hydrating colloids that bind
1.3 g of water per gram. Although proteins have been studied for a long time, a recently isolated slime
or P-protein from beans generated a lot of interest because of its large, calcium-dependent expansion
(and contraction) that led to a rapid plugging of pores near the wound sites (Knoblauch et al., 2003;
Mavroidis and Dubey, 2003). Many other interesting colloids in plants remain unidentiﬁed; they
often contain both carbohydrate and protein polymers and are summed under the name of mucilage
(e.g., Wainwright, 1995). Mucilage is known to swell perceptibly in water and can be precipitated
(dehydrated) with alcohol. The water-holding capacity of mucilage is known and has been used in the
herbal sciences where mucilage coating soothes inﬂamed mucous membranes and keeps them
hydrated (emollients) during coughs and bronchial infections. Large amounts of mucilage are
found outside and inside cells from plants in highly dehydrating environments, for example, cacti
and halophytes (Englmaier, 1987). Interesting are recent ﬁndings of mucilage in the water-transport-
ing xylem vessels of plants. The adhesion of water molecules to capillary walls ﬁlled with mucilage
could become stronger than their cohesion in the column and so localized mucilage secretion may be
a way to segment the long and heavy water column that otherwise would stretch uninterruptedly from
the soil to the tip of the plant and require a pull of more than 0.01 MPa per meter to be moved
(Zimmermann et al., 1994). An increase in xylem-bound mucilage was found after mechanical
wounding and might also have a blocking function for pathogens (Crews et al., 2003). Having a
conﬁrmed role in water storage and volume changes in desert, salt, and normal plants, we suggest that
mucilages are worth testing as potential motor material.
19.2.2.1 Macroscopic Swelling Bodies
One of the few investigated colloid-based plant motors are seeds, in particular pea seeds (Kuhne and
Kausch, 1965; Larson, 1968; see also Figure 19.1). The authors showed that the ﬁrst phase of
hydration is not associated with the development or enlargement of vacuoles and is hence not an
osmoticbutsimplecolloid-basedhydrationprocess.Thehydrationiseasytofollowsincetheseedsare
big and their expansion can be measured macroscopically. The imbibition pressure of hydrating pea
seeds is very high. For centuries botany students in Europe have been impressed by their
Figure 19.1
Dry (left) and hydrated (right) natural swelling bodies in the form of split pea seeds (A, shells have
been removed) and corn grits (B, grits are particles of broken seed endosperm). The ﬁnal volume increase is about
150% in split pea seeds and 200% in corn seed particles. Note that the smaller grit particles hydrate much faster
than the larger peas.
Nastic Structures: The Enacting and Mimicking of Plant Movements
477

teacher’s demonstration of how hydrating pea or bean seeds easily and effectively crack glass bottles
and animal skulls by what must be considered a slow, controlled, and silent demolition (Brauner and
Bukatsch, 1980). Although consisting of many smaller colloidal subunits (storage cells) pea seeds
are large, compact bodies that hydrate and expand as one unit. A hydration motor operating with
such compact swelling bodies rather than solute molecules has a huge advantage over an osmotic
design. It no longer needs a fragile membrane with ﬁne pores but can operate with a sturdy
and inexpensivemetallic or ceramic sieve with pores small enough to retain the dehydrated swelling
bodies.
However, pea seeds are designed to hydrate slowly and for that reason less than ideal motor
material. Two factors keep their rate of hydration low: (i) the mechanical resistance of seed shells to
expansion and (ii) the limited accessibility of the internal seed space to water (Larson, 1968). To
become technically attractive one needs swelling bodies with an increased access for water or other
solvents. The access to internal parts of a swelling body depends on the rate of diffusion and this
parallels the surface to volume ratio or speciﬁc surface (Levitt, 1969). The speciﬁc surface Sv is the
total area of all surfaces (S) of a body divided by its volume (V ):
Sv ¼ S=V:
In the case of a sphere (pea) with radius r this equation simpliﬁes to Sv ¼ 3/r and shows that with
increasing radius of round swelling bodies their Sv and with it accessibility to water decreases.
Large storage organs, such as potato tubers, fruits, and seeds, have very densely packed cells and
with no internal surfaces; that is, their accessibility or exchange of matter is restricted. The swelling
rate of such compact bodies can be increased by a reduced size. It is for this reason that the breaking
of seeds into smaller particles (grits) accelerates their hydration process (Figure 19.1).
Alternatively, hydration can be sped up by using particles with a more elaborate internal surface
as in plant organs like leaves where large intercellular airspaces provide an internal surface that is
10 to 32 times larger than their external surface (Turill, 1936). Exchange rates for leaves are many
orders of magnitude higher than for seeds. Rapidly swelling bodies can be produced by packing
colloid particles inside a porous and elastic shell. Such rapid swelling bodies would allow to
construct a simple and robust sieve-based colloid motor as shown in Figure 19.2.
A last consideration for the efﬁciency of colloid hydration is based on the fact that the diffusion of
water molecules is by 2 orders of magnitude faster in the gas phase than in liquid. The use of water-
saturated air rather than water in the motor shown in Figure 19.2 would considerably increase its

efﬁciency. We can combine this fact with the ﬁnding that quite a few plants developed hygroscopic
tissues that are able to extract water from the air. The list includes not only lichens, mosses, and tree
ferns but also higher plants like the gigantic mammoth trees (Sequoiadendron) and rootless epiphytic
orchids and bromeliads, including the so-called Spanish moss in the genus Tillandsia. Their hygro-
scopic tissues contain colloidal and matrix substances that hydrate easily and reversibly, character-
istics of prime interest for motor material. Another example is velamen, the dead tissue that coversthe
aerial roots of epiphytic orchids (Figure 19.3). Although the hygroscopic swellingof this tissue has no
apparent mechanical function, it functions to transfer the humidity of air to the internal root tissue and
the plant. Even among plants, this is an incredible achievement. It is useful to study the hydration of
such materials in more detail to understand the aggressive mechanisms of such hygroscopic struc-
tures. In the case of velamen, the hydration material consists of easily accessible, hygroscopic, and
dead cell walls; that is, the material is ﬁbrous.
19.2.3
Fibrous Motors
Fibrous motors are based on the adhesive absorption of water in internal capillary spaces of
parallel-arranged ﬁbers. Fibers are used as reinforcing elements in both technical and biological
designs; their role as hydration motors identiﬁes them as multifunctional materials. And yet this
multifunctionality has often been overlooked. With the exception of blotting paper and the wooden
stone splitters of ancient times, hydration-dependent form changes of wood have been mostly seen
as an annoyance rather than an opportunity.
The most common natural ﬁbrous material is cellulose. Cellulose is a polymer with a clearly
deﬁned hierarchical structure. Cellulose ﬁbers are made of long chains of glucose molecules twisted
together in a micellar bundle. These bundles are often found in a parallel arrangement to increase
the breaking strength of the material. Unlike isometrically expanding colloids, parallel ﬁbers swell
in a diametric fashion, that is, they expand only in the two directions that are perpendicular to the
direction of the ﬁbers (Figure 19.4).
Diametric expansion occurs when water ﬁlls the inter-ﬁbrillar spaces where it pushes the ﬁbers
apart without altering their length (Figure 19.4 and Figure 19.5). The space between the microﬁbril
bundles resembles small-sized capillaries and is large enough for water to move and be adsorbed
(Figure 19.5; Frey-Wyssling, 1959; Robards, 1974). The large internal or speciﬁc surface (Sv) of
cellulose bundles and other ﬁbers accounts for their rapid hydration. Fibrous hydration occurs in
the walls outside the living cell and therefore does not contribute to internal cell (turgor) pressure.
The obvious lack of operating osmotic motors in dead tissues led to an early acceptance of
operating ﬁbrous or wall-based hydration motors in nonliving tissues. Although this has not been
Figure 19.3

part of the root (gray) and the nonliving hygroscopic ﬁbrous layer, called velamen (white), surrounding it. Right side

demonstrated yet, there is no obvious reason that would exclude ﬁbrous motors from having a role
in some living tissues as well. Fibrous wall materials also line the plant’s water transport tubes
(called xylem vessels) and are known for their high adhesion for water molecules. This high
adhesion results in a considerable capillary pull of water. The high afﬁnity of wall materials is
technically used in blotting paper, which can absorb a considerable amount of water without a
considerable volume change (due to the random arrangement of the cellulose ﬁbers).
At some cells the same capillary spaces can be rapidly ﬁlled with the polyphenolic resin lignin
instead of water (Brett and Waldron, 1996). This process turns the water-permeable, hydrating–
swelling net of cellulose microﬁbrils into an inexpandable, water-repelling composite called wood
(Figure 19.5). Another way to create a layer with little hydration-dependent area change is a random
arrangement of the ﬁbers (Figure 19.6a). By combining swelling, modestly swelling, and non-
hydrating cellulose layers, plants generate a various monomorph actuators (Figure 19.6). Botanists
were among the ﬁrst who studied and correctly explained the movements of dead ﬁbrous hydration
motors as actuators consisting of two (or sometimes more) layers with different hydration-mediated
expansion characteristics. The encountered plant movements were modeled with paper laminates in
the form of two joined paper strips (Figure 19.6), each with a different orientation of the ﬁbers (Jost,
1933). The simple combination of a modestly or nonswelling layer (random orientation of the
ﬁbers) and a swelling layer with parallel ﬁbers generates a simple bending when the laminate is
hydrated (Figure 19.6a). A combination of two swelling layers with a perpendicular orientation of
their parallel aligned ﬁbers adds a rolling movement to the simple bending (Figure 19.6b). Finally,
with a 458 angle between the parallel oriented ﬁbers of the two strips, hydration subjects the
laminate to twisting and torsion (Figure 19.6c).

hydrating ﬁbrous motors is conﬁned to the two directions perpendicular to the parallel-oriented ﬁbers. Ancient
engineers used similar wooden motors to break rocks and walls.

they can be immediately ﬁlled with hydrophobic, water-prooﬁng lignin generating a sturdy, no longer swelling resin–

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

One should not forget that these paper models differ from nature’s designs in that they are glued
together when they are ﬂat and dehydrated and that they bend and twist when hydrated. The
opposite is the case in plant designs (see about seed containers in the following), which develop as
straight structures when hydrated and green, while tension and torsion arise with the severe
dehydration of the ripening seeds. This difference aside, these models are extremely useful to
mimic and hence fully comprehend existing natural ﬁbrous motors. They also elegantly demon-
strate the countless possibilities for multifunctional biomimetic designs where ﬁbers can serve both
as structural elements and as motors. One can safely predict that the biomimetic use of ﬁbrous
hydration will not stop with the development of blotting paper that is lignin-free and features a
loose and random orientation of the ﬁbers. Bio-inspired design of ﬁbers with larger relative volume
increase and force development than the original cellulose ﬁbers are a useful step on the way.
One example for the use of ﬁbrous motors in plants is the opening of seed containers like legume
pods to release the seeds. The walls of the seed pods are made of two attached ﬁbrous hydration
layers that have an angle of  908 to each other. Dehydration of the maturing walls leads to a
torsional twist that rips the pod apart spreading the seeds in different directions (Figure 19.7).
Although dehydration-induced torsion of ﬁbrous motors was used for an ‘‘advanced version of
medieval catapults,’’ called the ballista, few human-made designs use ﬁbrous torsion today.

NASTIC STRUCTURES IN PLANTS
Nastic movements are strictly deﬁned as organ responses lacking directional input from the causal
stimuli (see Introduction). In spite of this classic limitation to organs, one cannot avoid realizing
that similarly responding structures exist at any structural level from protein complexes to sub-
cellular swelling bodies (e.g., P-proteins, mucilage, and colloid vacuoles), dead cell walls
(Figure 19.5), one or more living cells (guard cell of stomatal complex, leaf-rolling bulliform
cells), organs (trap closure, shoot bending) to entire organisms (e.g., emergence of mescal cactus
Figure 19.6
Laminate paper models of monomorph (a) and bimorph (b, c) hydraulic actuators. The joining of a
swelling and a nonswelling layer leads to a structure that will show simple bending upon hydration (a). When joining
two swelling layers with their ﬁbers and swelling direction at a 908 angle, hydration causes rolling and bending in the
same structure (b). A 458 angle between the ﬁbers of the two layers (c) leads to torsion and a twisted structure.

from the soil). In spite of their different complexity, all these structures show movements that are
reversible, independent from the direction of the triggering stimuli, and powered by some type of
hydration motors. While the deﬁnition could be expanded to suborgan levels of structure, it is
general enough to include two different types of nastic structures: (i) autonomous structures that
are driven by their own hydration motor and (ii) nonautonomous structures that depend on external
energy sources to work. Nonautonomous nastic structures are most frequently found in ﬂowers
where they work as strictly mechanical machines that force pollen on unsuspecting visitors. It is
the transmitted energy of the weight and impetus of a landing insect (legume ﬂowers) or bird
(Strelitzia reginae or bird-of-paradise ﬂowers) that causes the movement of stamens (legume
ﬂowers) or the opening of a protective envelope around the stamens (S. reginae). Details of these
structures can be found in many reviews and monographs on plant reproduction (e.g., Meeuse and
Morris, 1984).
The following part focuses on examples for the even more intriguing, autonomously working
nastic structures that contain their own motors and hence depend on external factors only for
stimulation. Such autonomous nastic devices consist of a motor and structures that modify and
direct the forces it generates. Therefore, nastic structures could be well deﬁned as asymmetric or
heterogeneous elastic restraints of hydration motors. Whether they surround osmotic, colloidal
or ﬁbrous motors, the unequal restraints are almost always realized by heterogeneous depositions of
the cell wall material and in particular by a different direction of the deposited layers of cellulose
microﬁbrils. Depending on the complexity of the nastic structures, the asymmetry can be located
between the opposite walls of one cell (e.g., guard cell), between cell layers (Venus ﬂytrap) or
between internal and external tissues (growing stems). Nastic cells or organs are characterized
by asymmetric capacities for elastic expansion that result in asymmetric expansions in the form
of curved responses. The following part of the chapter describes the functioning of nastic
structures through different levels of complexity and provides useful examples of how plants use
their motors.
19.3.1
Hydrostat Motor Cells — Source and Location of Movements
Most plant movements and growth are driven by osmotic motors. These motors are located in either
young cells or specialized cells that feature thin, expandable walls and a large, osmotically
pressurized central vacuole (Figure 19.8). If not part of specialized units (guard cells of stomatal
pores, pulvinus cells of bendable petioles, etc.) these young and undifferentiated cells are constitu-
ents of a tissue called parenchyma. The behavior of these cells compares well to pressure-dependent
mechanical softness and rigidity of human-made inﬂatables and they are referred to sometimes as
Figure 19.7

(angle of 908). When dehydrating (top), this torsion motor rips the pod apart and releases the seeds.

hydrostats (Niklas, 1989, 1992), sometimes as motor cells (Pfeffer, 1873). The term motor cell
refers to the ability of cells to rapidly expand or shrink their vacuoles, cell volume, and surface area.
The term hydrostat refers to the characteristic of cells and cell complexes (tissues) to undergo
striking changes in their mechanical properties in dependence on the degree of water uptake and
inﬂation. The soft walls and plasticity of hydrostat tissues turns into a very rigid structure upon full
hydration or inﬂation, which generates a high internal pressure and exposes the cell walls to high
tension and rigidity. The most common and basic function of such hydrostats is (i) to constitute the
expanding, growing parts of the plant and (ii) to provide rigidity, stability, and expandability to
these parts. Niklas (1992) calculated that only cells with a wall thickness considerably less than
20% of the cell radius will exhibit hydrostat and motor behavior. Reversibly expanding motor cells
need to have walls with sufﬁcient elasticity, that is, the walls should stretch while building an elastic
tension that returns the cell to its original size when the initiating pressure is relieved.
A ﬁtting example for a hydrostat motor tissue is the pith parenchyma in the core of younger
sunﬂower stems (Figure 19.9). When well-hydrated, the parenchyma cells of the pith exert radial
pressure on the peripheral cell layers of the stem and give it rigidity and straightness (Kutschera,
1989). Dehydration of the pith cells softens and bends (wilts) the upper, younger part of the stem.
Observation of stem slices shows that it is the lack of pressure from the shrinking pith cells that
causes wilted bending of the stem (Figure 19.9). In older, no longer growing parts of the stem, pith
cells die and ﬁll with air (sectioned pith appearance turns to white) before disappearing altogether
(stem becomes hollow). Meanwhile the older stem is reinforced through lignin depositions in the
peripheral ring of vascular bundles that turns their walls into a stable ﬁber–resin composite. The
older stem is no longer a hydrostatically stabilized structure.
19.3.2
From Isotropic Cell Pressure to Anisotropic Cell Expansion
The form of cell expansions is always determined by a combination of motors and nonexpandable
materials surrounding them. While ﬁber motors are inherently structural by showing anisotropic
expansions, the common vacuole-based osmotic and colloid motors are unstructured in the sense
that they exert equal pressure in all directions. To convert the isotropic vacuolar pressure into a
anisometric cell expansion, plant cells use anisotropic depositions in their cell walls. The original
cell wall is made of cellulose and similar ﬁbers, polyelectrolyte gels like pectin (made of galac-
turonic acid monomers that keep an unbalanced carboxyl group after polymerization), as well as
Figure 19.8
A hydrostat network of thin-walled, elastic and expandable parenchyma cell walls internally pres-
surized by vacuoles. This kind of tissue is soft when dehydrated and rigid when fully pressurized (inﬂated) and
provides the basis for most reversible (cell walls undergo elastic expansion) and irreversible (cell walls yield to
stress and are plastically altered) volume changes in plant tissues. Volume changes of these thin-walled cellular
networks are the motor behind many nastic movements.

other colloid materials (for detailed reviews see Vincent, 1982; Taiz, 1984; Cleland et al., 1990;
Brett and Waldron, 1996).
Cellulose ﬁbrils wrap the internal cell motor in either a single or many subsequently deposited
layers creating either a primary or secondary walls. If there are many layers and the microﬁbril
directions between these separate layers are diverse enough, the wall will provide multidirectional
support and the cell has no directional preference for expansion. Older cells with secondary walls
resist the vacuolar pressure equally well in all directions. The same principle applies to the
multidirectional strength of plywood (Figure 19.10). However, if a cell is young or part of a nastic
structure, it has only a thin primary wall with one cellulose layer with one dominant direction of the
microﬁbrils. Such anisotropic walls provide young cells with a preferred direction for their
expansion. Young tubular stem cells most frequently show preference for a transverse (radial)
orientation of the microﬁbrils or for a low pitch helix. Since such microﬁbril arrangements favor
axial and restrict diametrical extension, the cells are bound to elongate and develop into a narrow
cylindrical shape.
During the growth of plant stem cells have most of their microﬁbrils around them in rings or
helices with increasing pitch. The feature of helical microﬁbril bundles, particularly prominent
in the collenchyma cells of vascular tissues and tendrils, provides stems with an astonishingly
high resistance to tension, high strain, and breaking strength they are famous for (Wainwright,
1980; Vincent, 1982). Both osmotically driven expansion and external pull affect an increasingly
vertical reorientation of the cellulose microﬁbrils that ﬁnally terminates cell expansion (Robards,
1974). Additional processes like the deposition of multiple cellulose layers or the resin lignin, as
well as the disappearance of expansion-catalyzing enzymes, complete the termination of cell
expansion. Some older cells may also lose their liquid content and turn into dead wood or cork
cells. The stability of such cells no longer depends on internal pressure but exclusively on the static
stability of their walls (Gibson and Ashby, 1982). Even in dead wood cells it is the spiral
arrangement of the most prominent S2 cell wall layer that resists tension and deﬂects cracks and
makes wood ten times more resistant to fracture than plain ﬁber–resin composites (Gordon and
Jerominidis, 1980).
Figure 19.9 (See color insert following page 302)
A stable, erect sunﬂower stem (left panel) depends on the
pressure of internal, easily expandable hydrostat tissue (pith ¼ transparent cells in center panel) that tensions the
stronger-walled surface layers of the stem giving them rigidity and stability. The well-known limp shape of wilting
young plant stems (right panel) occurs when the internal, thin-walled pith tissue dehydrates, shrinks (center panel)
and ceases to exert radial pressure on the surface layer and keeps it under tension. Left panel shows fully hydrated
sunﬂower stem and right panel a dehydrated stem; the center panel demonstrates volume reduction in pith during
dehydration of a segment slice. Pith parenchyma acts as a hydrostat motor that provides herbaceous stems with
stability and the driving force for expansion.

19.3.3
Guard Cells or How to Make a Pore
Although directional deposition of microﬁbrils provides different wall resistance to diametric and
axial cell expansion of stem cells, the wall resistance does not differ on both sides of the elongating
cell axis and therefore such cells have a directed but linear expansion. Guard cells, however, are an
example where asymmetrical wall resistance on the ﬂanks of the cell axis lead to an unequal
expansion of the ﬂanks and a curved shape of the cell. Since these cells are used to create openings
in a surface layer, guard cells always occur in pairs. Their asymmetric expansion leads to the
opening of a stomatal pore within the inexpandable ﬂanks of two cells (Figure 19.11). A stomatal
pore is a reversible, nastic structure that operates as a valve in the leaf surface to balance the
photosynthetic intake of carbon dioxide (to be assimilated into sugars) with the loss of water exiting
the leaf in a process of forced evaporation that generates negative pressure.
Plants use the opening of these pores to (i) cool the leaf surface, (ii) access the carbon dioxide in
the air, and (iii) as the jets of a capillary vacuum pump that through evaporation generates
(absolute) negative pressures far beyond the capacity of human-made designs and lifts water
and ions in the capillary tubes of the xylem. Different models have been developed to explain
the asymmetric expansion of guard cells (Figure 19.12). All models agree that the basis for this
behavior is an asymmetry of cell wall characteristics but they differ in the speciﬁcs of this structural
requirement. The oldest model claims that this kind of expansion is due to the conspicuousthicken-
ing of the inner walls adjacent to the stomatal pore. Later models deny the role of wall thickening
and explain the asymmetric expansion of the guard cells and the resulting pore formation by either
the symmetry of guard cells (Cooke et al., 1977) or more convincingly with the arrangement of the
radial microﬁbril bundles that are tightly wound near the ends and looser near the center of the
guard cells (Aylor et al., 1973). Still others (including the authors of this chapter) think that it is not
so much the thickening of the inner walls but the enigmatic structure that is behind the thickening
— a ring made of cutin, a waterprooﬁng resin polymer found as a common coating on the walls of
most epidermal cells of leaves. Even after the guard cell walls have been digested by
enzymatic mixtures, the cutin rings remain intact and ﬂoat in the solution in the form of a gaping
mouth. Aside from separating the inner walls and water-prooﬁng the pore walls, the ring itself is
the only direct physical connection between the two guard cells. Attached only to the inner

If the microﬁbril directions between the separate cell wall layers are diverse enough, the wall will
provide multidirectional support and the cell has no directional preference for expansion. This principle is also the
biomimetic basis for the design of plywood. (From Brett C, Waldron K (1996) Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant

walls, it connects only the ends of the cells and resists all attempts of the guard cell to increase the
vertical axis of the pore (Figure 19.11 and Figure 19.12). With the expansion of the inner walls
prevented by the ring and an enlargement of the diameter prevented by radial arrangement of the
microﬁbril bundles, the only expandable surface left is then the outer wall and any volume increase
of the guard cell must now lead to cell bending and the formation of a pore.
Using hydrostatic devices like bicycle tubes, balloons, tapes, and ropes all three mechanical
models were able to reproduce opening and closure of a pore and hence, supported the validity of
each of the suggested explanations (Figure 19.12). With three alternative mechanical models
simulating pore openings it seems possible that nature used more than just one mechanism — the
principle of redundancy — to produce a highly reliable design.

19.3.2
Leaf Motors
Although microstructural arrangements at the cell wall level sufﬁce to generate functioning
structures like stomatal valves, most nastic structures involve multiple cells and cell layers. We
show here the functioning of three different nastic structures that serve (i) to rapidly bend (ii) to fold
or unfold, and (iii) to position a leaf in either a horizontal or vertical direction.
19.3.2.1 Venus Flytrap (Dionea muscipula)
Venus ﬂytraps have a leaf with two rapidly closing halves designed to trap insects needed to
supplement their nitrogen supply. The closure of Venus ﬂytraps is an example showing how nastic
movement is organized at a more complex level than the cell pair of stomatal pores. Although there
is still considerable uncertainty about the exact mechanism (for a recent version see Forterre et al.,
2005), we can state with conﬁdence that the operating principle also consists of an internal hydrostat
or motor being asymmetrically restricted. Although the ﬂytrap leaf seems to bend like a bimorph
actuator, it is a trimorphic structure with exceptionally large motor cells in the center of a trap leaf
(Figure 19.12). These motor cells are so intimately connected to the two adjacent, epidermal surface
layers that they cannot be separated experimentally (Hodick and Sievers, 1988). The inner (upper or
red) surface has sensory hairs and the digestive glands and with only 5% a strikingly lower
extensibility than the outer (lower or green) surface featuring 20% or a ﬁve times higher extensi-
bility. According to the different extensibilities, a sudden, rapid and powerful expansion of the
internal motor cells leads to an equally rapid curving of the leaf halves towards the center and the
closure of the trap (Figure 19.13). Forced to beat the rapid movements of the muscles and extremely
rapid resilin-springs of its insect prey (Alexander, 1992) the ﬂytrap developed one of the fastest
nastic movement known in plants.
Figure 19.13 (See color insert following page 302)
Leaves of Venus ﬂytraps have large, powerful motor cells
in their center. The rapid expansion of these cells is modiﬁed by different extensibilities of the two adjacent surface
(epidermis) layers. These anisotropic restraints turn a linear expansion into the rapid curving of the leaf and closure
of the trap. This mechanism is triggered when the sensory hairs at the upper surface are repeatedly touched.

19.3.2.2 Leaf Rolling or the Autonomous Unfolding of Surface Area
Similar, slower leaf-folding movements are carried out by many by other plants, not with the
purpose to trap insects but to restrict transpirational water loss. Structural unfolding of rhododen-
dron leaves, grass leaves, cacti stems, etc., occurs in response to favorable environmental condi-
tions (in particular sufﬁcient humidity or root water supply). Under adverse conditions many
grasses, such as Kentucky bluegrass Poa pratense, tall wheatgrass Agropyron elongatum, Trades-
cantia species, as well as dicot leaves of some rhododendrons, roll their leaves to prevent excessive
dehydration. In grasses this response is triggered by large, bulliform cells in the upper epidermis
(Figure 19.14). Since these cells have no or only a very thin impregnating coat (cuticle) they lose
water more rapidly than other epidermal cells, thereby shrinking the surface area of the upper leaf
and rolling it around the midvein. This measure drastically reduces any further evaporation from the
upper surface. A similar mechanism operates in dicot leaves of rhododendrons that roll in the
opposite direction. The preferred dehydration and shrinking of the lower epidermis cells (all of
them), as well as the shrinking of patches of very loosely arranged mesophyll cells in the blade
center (cross sections not shown), cause a very rapid, reversible coiling of the blade around the
midvein of Rhododendron leaves (Figure 19.15).
Figure 19.14
Leaf rolling in grass blades of Agropyron elongatum, the tall wheatgrass. This nastic movement is
driven by leaf rollers — small hydration motors that consist of only a few large bulliform cell joints (left panel) placed at
regular intervals along the upper surface of the leaf. The easy dehydration of these uncoated cell clusters contracts
the upper surface and so rolls and even sharply folds the leaves of grasses in a rapid and reversible manner. Right
panel: rapid rolling is visible in dehydrating leaf slices (sequential pictures taken with interval of 1 min).
Figure 19.15
Rolling in dehydrated rhododendron blades differs from grass blades in that it is downwards and
not driven by discrete bulliform cell joints. The preferred dehydration and shrinking of the lower epidermis, as well
as patches of very loosely arranged mesophyll cells in the blade center (cross sections not shown), cause a
downward curving of the blade around the midvein (a). A rectangular leaf section turns into a roll within a few
minutes exposure to dry lab air (b).

19.3.2.3 Leaf ‘‘Muscles’’ or Pulvini
Leaves of Phaseolus, Oxalis, Desmodium, Mimosa and many other plants can undergo slow or
sudden nastic ‘‘sleep movements,’’ in which the drooping leaf stalk brings the leaf blade from a
horizontal into a more vertical position. Although reasons for this movement are still unknown, the
fact that several unrelated plant species independently developed similar designs, makes one safely
conclude that it is worth the effort. The organ involved in elevating and lowering the antenna-like
structure of the leaf blade is a so-called leaf muscle or pulvinus, a swollen joint-like structure at the
basal part of a lever (the leaf stalk or petiole) that attaches the leaf to the stem. The functioning of
this unusual crane rests solely with the hydrostat motor cells of the parenchyma below the central
vascular bundle of the pulvinus (Figure 19.16). As these cells dehydrate and shrink the leaf drops
rapidly. It rises slowly again when they regain a pressure large enough to overcome the gravita-
tional force of the leaf blade. An antagonistic course of events in the cells on top of the vascular
bundle of the petiole help these movements but is less critical for the mechanism (Satter and Morse,
1990). Intriguing is that so far no ion channel has been found that is rapid and large enough to
account for the rapid loss of pressure and volume in the motor cells of the lower petiole of Mimosa
and Oxalis species. It is instructive to note that the petiole construction (cross sections pictured
above the leaf stalk in Figure 19.16) changes from a statically stable design supported by ﬁbrous
bundles in the periphery to a statically unstable structure (after the vascular support moved from the
periphery to the center) that now has to be supported by the hydrostatic pressure of the parenchyma
cells at the lower half of the pulvinus.
19.3.2.4 External Structures Allowing Large Volume Changes
The expansion and shrinking of entire plant bodies qualiﬁes as a slow nastic movement. A truly
remarkable example was ﬁrst mentioned by Paturi (1976). He refers to the impressive adaptation of
the mescal cactus Lophophora williamsii, which converts the dehydration-induced shrinking during
the beginning of the dry season to reduce the shoot length and submerge below the desert ﬂoor.
After just one seasonal rainfall the hydrating shoot reemerges by pushing the photosynthesizing
apex out of its soil cover into the light and open air (Figure 19.17). Although smaller-sized volume
oscillations occur also in fruits, leaves, and stems, they are most prominent in the strange, leaﬂess
Figure 19.16
Longitudinal and cross sections of the swollen base (pulvinus) of a leaf stalk of Mimosa pudica.
Cross sections (pictured above the stalk) show that a centralization of the vascular bundles allows bending of this
organ in an almost joint-like fashion. Loss of ions from the hydrostat parenchyma cells below the central vascular
tubing leads to simple and reversible buckling of the structure and drops the leaf into a vertical position. (From

column-like shoots of xerophytic desert plants. The unique circumferential shape of these xero-
phytes reminds us of an accordion or the Eiffel tower (Figure 19.18). It is this structure that allows
the ribbed xerophyte shoots to undergo extensive volume changes (shrinking and swelling) without
exposing the most important surface to a parallel but highly dangerous change in their area. The
external cell layers include both the shoot’s only photosynthesizing cells and the mechanical
support structure of the shoot in the form of an external, ﬁbrous network.
These accordion-like, inﬂatable shoot structures allow substantial volume changes for water
storage in the stem center (white area in Figure 19.18b), while an unchanged surface area is
maintained by changing from a concave to a convex shape (Figure 19.18c). The unique adaptation
of this stem design becomes apparent if we compare it with volume changes in herbal plants
from moderate climate zones. Figure 19.9 shows clearly how a shrinking pith tissue in a sunﬂower
stem reduces the surface tension and with it the stability of the entire stem, which turns limp
showing the familiar structural collapse known as wilting. Another adaptive advantage of this
pleated-column structure is that dehydration and shrinking increase the length of protruding ridges
and so provide increased self-shading of the shoot surface in an environment that has little other
shade to offer.
Figure 19.17
Picture shows the almost completely buried shoot of a mescal cactus. Vertical shoot expansion
after rainfall and shrinking in the dry period cause the appearance and disappearance of the photosynthetically
active shoot apex in the ground — a very useful adaptation of this plant to a harsh environment, the Mesoamerican
desert.
Figure 19.18 (See color insert following page 302)
The shoots of desert plants in the Cactus and Euphorbia
families often adopt the shape of pleated columns (a) a structure which allows the photosynthesizing periphery to
maintain its area in spite of massive volume losses in the shoot center. Cross sections of a pleated-column shoot
show increasing dehydration from upper to lower pictures (b) with a considerable volume loss of the shoot center
(c) and remarkable constancy in the area of a surface that changes its shape from a convex to a concave outline.

BIO-INSPIRED MATERIALS FOR BIOMIMETIC ACTION — CONCLUSIONS
Plants are adaptive machines that have developed and perfected their structures over millions of
years of evolution in constantly changing and increasingly complex environments. With their
autonomous and locally controlled responses plant movements do not require remote control
through a central nervous system or computer. Life originated in water and nastic structures as
well as their motors are optimized to use the potentialities of this unique solvent. In addition to
ATP-dependent molecular motors, contracting or inﬂating molecules, such as the P-protein of the
phloem conduits, we presented here three types of hydration motors (osmotic, colloidal, and
ﬁbrous) that ﬁgure as the major workhorses for nastic plant movements. Most plant movements
and growth are driven by osmotic motors, and several examples illustrate how the isometric,
internal cell pressure is transmitted into anisometric movement patterns. Colloid motors are
known to be used by plants to overcome the formidable resistance of multilayered seed shells to
start germination. Fibrous motors are known to be involved in the opening of seed containers.
A striking particularity of nastic structures is an efﬁcient and inconspicuous design that integrates
two or more functions (like motor and valve or sensor, motor and lever) in one smoothly operating
unit. The knowledge gained from studying nastic structures is key input for designing human-made
adaptive structures and smart materials and includes novel and increasingly complex multifunctional
materials like ﬁber-reinforced bio-composites, pressure-sensing, humidity-sensing, sugar (or other
chemical)-sensing ﬁber-reinforced hydrogels, nastic-inspired combinations of actuators, and force-
guiding structures like matrixes with pressurized body inclusions, as well as arrayed actuators
combining memory shape alloys, photomechanical ﬁlms, electro-active polymers, and sensing
hydrogels in one multifunctional unit. Even the most modest, selective presentation of such bio-
inspired materials and designs is far beyond the scope of this chapter but good examples can be
found in some chapters of this book and other publications as well (e.g., Taya, 2003). In the past, some
passive plant structures have served as the basis for a few successful phytomimetic designs of
buildings (Paxton’s Crystal Palace in London following rib construction of ﬂoating leaves from
Victoria amazonica), attachments [VELCRO fastener after burdock or Arctium seed pods (Paturi,
1976; Benyus, 1997; Vincent, 1997; Vogel, 1998)], and airplanes [wings of glider and motor planes
with extremely reduced stalling features were designed after Zanonia seeds (Etrich, 1915)]. The next
generation of phytomimetic designs is more likely to be inspired by active plant structures like
those reviewed here. Powerful and energy-efﬁcient, auto-sensing and autonomously adjusting,
multifunctional, exhaust-free and silent actuators, tools, motors, as well as new materials from
leak-free storage of liquids to the silent demolition of buildings, can be based on the integrated
workings of nastic structures. By reviewing the major guiding principles and selected examples of
natural nastic structures, this chapter is meant to inspire, stimulate, and broaden their current and
future technical application.

INTRODUCTION
After 3.8 billion years of evolution, nature has learned how to use minimum resources to achieve
maximal performance and come up with numerous lasting solutions (Gordon, 1976). Recognizing
that nature’s capability continues to be signiﬁcantly ahead of many of our technologies, humans
have always sought to mimic nature. The ﬁeld of study pertaining to this, which is also called
biomimetics, bionics, or biogenesis, has reached impressive levels. It includes imitating some of
the human thinking process in computers by mimicking such human characteristics as making
decisions and operating autonomously. Biology offers a great model for the development of
mechanical tools, computational algorithms, effective materials, as well as novel mechanisms
and information technology. Some of the commercial implementations of the progress in biomi-
metics can be seen in toy stores, where toys seem and behave like living creatures (e.g., dogs, cats,
birds, and frogs). More serious beneﬁts of biomimetics include the development of prosthetic
implants that appear very much like they are of biological origin, and sensory aiding mechanisms
that are interfaced to the brain to assist in hearing, seeing, or controlling instruments. As described
and discussed throughout this book, the topic of biomimetics is very broad and covers many
disciplines, with applications and implications for numerous areas of our life.
495

Robotics is one biomimetic area in which advances are continually being made. The movie
industry has created a vision of robots that are human-like at a level signiﬁcantly far beyond what is
currently feasible. However, even though it will be a long time before such robotic capabilities
become a reality, there are already numerous examples of accomplishments (Bar-Cohen and
Breazeal, 2003). Initially, robots were not well received because they were considered too bulky
and too expensive, requiring major amount of work to employ, maintain, modify, and upgrade.
Solving these problems by making robots more biomimetic became feasible when powerful
lightweight microprocessors were introduced. These improvements included high computation
speed, very large memory, wireless communication with a wide bandwidth, effective control
algorithms, miniature position indicators using Global Positioning Satellites (GPS), and powerful
software tools including artiﬁcial intelligence techniques. Advancements in computers and control
methodologies led to the development of sophisticated robots with a signiﬁcant expansion of the
capability to emulate biological systems. Autonomous robots were developed and they have
successfully demonstrated their ability to perform many human- and animal-like functions. Such
robots offer superior capabilities to operate in harsh or hazardous environments that are too
dangerous for humans. Progress in intelligent biomimetic robots is expected to impact many aspects
of our lives, especially in performing tasks that are too risky to execute by humans, or too expensive
to employ humans (e.g., operate as movie actors). These robots may also be used in tasks that
combine the advantages of biological creatures in a hybrid form, which are far beyond any known
system or creature, including operating in multiple environments (ﬂying, walking, swimming,
digging, etc.).
This book has focused on aspects that are related to biology which have inspired artiﬁcial
applications and technologies. Many inventions have been based on concepts that have had their
roots in biology. However, since natural inventions are not recorded in a form that one can identify
in engineering terms, the inventions that were produced by humans may have been coincidently
similar, subconsciously inspired, or their origin in nature may not have been well documented. In
this chapter, the author makes an attempt to summarize the current status of biomimetics, its
challenges, and its outlook for the future.
20.2
BIOLOGY AS A MODEL
Nature has an enormous pool of inventions that passed the harsh test of practicality and durability in
a changing environment. In order to harness the most from nature’s inventions it is critical to bridge
the gap between the ﬁelds of biology and engineering. This bridging effort can be a key to turning
nature’s inventions into engineering capabilities, tools, and mechanisms. In order to approach
nature in engineering terms it is necessary to sort biological capabilities along technological
categories using a top-down structure or vice versa. Namely, one can take each aspect of the
biologically identiﬁed characteristics and seek an analogy in terms of an artiﬁcial technology.
The emergence of nano-technologies, miniature, highly capable and fast microprocessors, effective
power storage, large compact and fast access memory, wireless communication and so on
are making the mimicking of nature capabilities signiﬁcantly more feasible. One reason for this
is both natural and artiﬁcial structures depend on the same fundamental units of atoms and
molecules. Generally, biological terms can be examined and documented analogously to engineer-
ing categories as shown in Table 20.1.
Some of nature’s capabilities can inspire new mechanisms, devices, and robots. Examples
include the beaver’s engineering capability to build dams, and the woodpecker’s ability to impact
wood while suppressing the effect from damaging its brain. Another inspiring capability is the
ability of numerous creatures to operate with multiple mobility options including ﬂying, digging,
swimming, walking, hopping, running, climbing, and crawling. Increasingly, biologically inspired
capabilities are becoming practical including collision avoidance using whiskers or sonars,
496
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

controlled camouﬂage, and materials self-healing. One of the challenging capabilities will be to
create reconﬁgurable systems that match or exceed the butterﬂy life stages that include egg,
caterpillar, cocoon, and butterﬂy. Other challenges include making miniature devices that can ﬂy
with enormous maneuvering capability like a dragonﬂy; adhere to smooth and rough walls like a
gecko; camouﬂage by adapting itself to the texture, patterns, and shape of the surrounding
environment like a chameleon, or reconﬁgure its body to travel through very narrow tubes like
an octopus. Further challenges also include processing complex 3D images in real time; recycling
mobility power for highly efﬁcient operation and locomotion; self-replication; self-growing using
resources from the surrounding terrain; chemical generation and storage of energy; and many such
capabilities for which biology offers a model for science and engineering inspiration. While many
aspects of biology are still beyond our understanding, signiﬁcant progress has been made.
Biological designs and processes follow the template that is written in the organisms’ DNA,
which deﬁnes the building blocks of all living organisms. This archival storage of construction
codes of all organisms’ is stored in the nucleus of all living cells and it consists of strands of nucleic
acids: guanine, adenine, thymine, and cytosine. These four nucleic acids are assembled as long
sentences of biological laws and they guide the function of living cells through a simple universal
process. Information contained in the DNA is transcribed in the nucleus by RNA polymerase and
sent out of the nucleus as messenger RNA that is translated at the ribosomes into amino acids, the
building blocks of proteins. Proteins are the foundation of all life: from cellular to organism levels
and they play a central role in the manifestation of populations, ecosystems, and global dynamics.
Designers of human-made systems are seeking to produce sequence-speciﬁc polymers that consti-

tute proteins in order to make products and services that meet the needs of humans and the demand
of consumers. Cloning the DNA allows you to produce synthetic life while adapting nature’s
principles allows you to create artiﬁcial life and biomimetic tools and capabilities.
20.3
CHARACTERISTICS OF BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED MECHANISMS
There are many characteristics that identify a biomimetic mechanism and some of the important
ones include the ability to operate autonomously in complex environments, perform multifunc-
tional tasks and adaptability to unplanned and unpredictable changes. Making mechanisms with
such characteristics dramatically increases the possible capabilities and can reach levels that can be
as good or superior to humans or animals. This may include operating for 24 h a day without a break
or operating in conditions that pose health risks to humans. Beneﬁts from such capabilities can
include performance of security monitoring and surveillance, search and rescue operations, chem-
ical, biological, and nuclear hazardous operations, immediate corrective and warning actions as
well as others that are only limited by our imagination. Some of the biologically inspired capabil-
ities that are/can be implemented into effective mechanisms include:
.
Multifunctional materials and structures (Chapters 12 and 14):
Biological systems use
materials and structures in an effective conﬁguration and functionality incorporating sensor and
actuation to operate and react as needed. Using multifunctional materials and structures allows
nature to maximize the use of the available resources at minimum mass (Rao, 2003). An example is
our bones, which support our body weight and provide the necessary body stiffness while operating
as our ‘‘factory’’ for blood that is produced in the bone marrow. Another example is the feathers in
birds, which are used for ﬂying as well as for thermal insulation and the control of heat dissipation.
Mimicking multi-functionality capabilities, system are made to operate more effectively in robots
provided with ability to grasp and manipulate objects and with mobility of appendages or sub-
appendages (hands, ﬁngers, claws, wings). Some of the concerns with regard to the application of
multiple functionality is the associated design difﬁculties where there is a need to simultaneously
satisfy many constraints. Design changes in one part of the system affect many other parts.
.
High strength conﬁgurations:
The geometry of birds’ eggs have quite interesting character-
istics. On the one hand, they are amazingly strong from the outside, so a bird can warm its eggs by
sitting on them till the chicks hatch. On the other hand, they are easily breakable from the inside, so
the chicks can break the shell with their beak once they are ready to emerge into the outside world.
.
Just-in-time manufacturing:
Producing as needed and at the time of the need is widely used in
biology and such examples include the making of the web by spiders or the production of the toxic
chemicals by snakes. Such a capability is increasingly adapted by industry as a method of lowering
the cost of operation. Many industries are now manufacturing their products in small quantities as
needed to meet consumers demand right at the assembly line. Thus, industry is able to cope with the
changing demand and decline or rise in orders for its products.
.
Deployable structures:
The leaves of most plants are folded or rolled while still inside the bud.
The way they unfold to emerge into to a fully open leaf can inspire deployable structures for space,
including gossamer structures such as solar sails and antennae as well as terrestrial applications
such as tents and other covering structures (Guest and Pellegrino, 1994; Unda et al., 1994;
Kobayashi et al., 1998).
.
Hammering without vibration back-propagation:
The woodpecker (Picidae family) has the
amazing capability to tap and drill holes in solid wood in search of insects and other prey (Bock,
1999). One example is the Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus), which is a member of the
woodpecker family, shown in Figure 20.1. The brain of the woodpecker is protected from damage
as there is very little space between it and the skull preventing rotation during impact. Some
woodpecker species have modiﬁed joints between certain bones in the skull and upper jaw, as well
as muscles which contract to absorb the shock of the hammering. A strong neck, tail-feather
muscles, and a chisel-like bill are other hammering adaptations in some species. This ability to
absorb the shocks and prevent damage to the bird brain or cause disorientation could inspire a
498
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

mechanism for protecting operators of jackhammers. The vibrations generated by the jackhammer
back-propagate into the hand and body of the operator. These vibrations can cause severe damage
including the pulling out the teeth from the operator mouth. Mimicking the shock-absorbing
mechanism of the woodpecker beak may offer an effective approach to suppressing back-propa-
gated vibrations from the jackhammer.
.
Nanostructures (Chapters 7 and 8):
Biology consists of complex nanostructures that allow
many capabilities that are far beyond current human capabilities. Recent developments in nano-
and micro-fabrication, as well as self-assembly techniques, are driving the development of new
functional materials and unique coatings that mimic biomaterials. For controlled adhesion, efforts
are underway to mimic the geckos and their setae. These setae, which are microscopic hairs on the
bottom of their feet, use van der Waals forces to run fast on smooth surfaces such as glass (Autumn
and Peattie, 2003). Further, there are efforts to produce the biomimetic equivalence of cells as
described in Chapters 1 and 15.
.
Behavior and cooperative operation (Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 16):
Biologically inspired systems
need to autonomously recognize and navigate in various environments, perform critical tasks that
include terrain following, target location and tracking, and cooperative tasks such as hive and
swarm behavior. Such activity requires the incorporation of principles that are derived from
biological behaviors of social groups. Ants serve as a model for accomplishing tasks that are
much bigger than an individual.
.
Mimicking aerodynamic performance:
The development of aerodynamic structures and sys-
tems was inspired by birds and the shape of wind-dispersed seeds. Trees disperse their seeds to
great distances using various aerodynamic principles that allow them to use the wind. The
propelling capability of seeds has inspired designs of futuristic missions with spacecraft that
could soft land on atmospheric planets such as Mars. Adapting this design may offer a better
alternative than parachutes, with a better capability to steer towards selected sites. In recent years,
increasing efforts have been made to develop miniature ﬂying vehicles, especially since the terror

attack in September 11, 2001. Micro-air-vehicle (MAV) with wing spans of several centimeters has
been developed using a propeller, and efforts are currently underway to produce even smaller MAV
units (http://uav.wff.nasa.gov/).
.
Mobility (Chapter 6):
Mobility is a characteristic of animals that involves multi-functionality,
energy efﬁciency (not necessarily optimized), and autonomous locomotion. Animals can operate in
multiple terrains, performing various locomotion functions and combinations, including walking,
crawling, climbing (trees, cliffs, or walls), jumping and leaping, swimming, ﬂying, grasping,
digging, and manipulating objects. Integration of such locomotion functions into a hybrid mech-
anism would potentially enable mobile transitions between air, land, and water. Making robots with
such capabilities will far exceed any biological equivalence.
.
Attaching to steep walls and upside down from a ceiling:
As shown in Chapter 1, the swallow is
capable of attaching itself to walls by carrying its body weight on its ﬁngernails. The gecko is capable
of controlled adherence to rough and soft surfaces. Mimicking this capability, a gecko tape was made
by microfabrication of dense arrays of ﬂexible plastic pillars, the geometry of which was optimized
to ensure their collective adhesion (Geim et al., 2003). This approach showed a way to manufacture
self-cleaning, reattachable dry adhesives, although problems related to the gecko tapes durability
and mass production are yet to be resolved. Generally, controlled adhesion is a capability that is
sought by roboticists to adapt into robotic devices. A four-legged robot, named Steep Terrain Access
Robot (STAR) (Badescu et al., 2005), is being developed at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and is
designed to climb rocks and steep cliffs using an ultrasonic/sonic anchor that uses low axial force to
anchor the legs (Bar-Cohen and Sherrit 2003). This robot is shown in Figure 20.2.
.
Autonomous locomotion:
Inspiration from biology led to the introduction of robots and systems
that operate autonomously with self-learning capability (Chapters 3, 4, and 6). Such a capability to
operate without real-time control by a human operator is critical to the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) missions that are performed at distant extraterrestrial conditions
where remote-control operation is not feasible. The distance of millions of miles from Earth to
Mars causes a signiﬁcant communication time delay, and necessitates an autonomous capability to
assure the success of the NASA planetary exploration missions.
.
Sensors and feedback:
The integration of sensors into biomimetic systems is critical to their
operation and it is necessary to provide closed-loop feedback to accomplish biologically inspired

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

tasks. Nature uses many types of sensors, and some of them were already mimicked in artiﬁcial
devices, including the collision-detection whiskers in automatic vacuum cleaners and mobile toys.
Combining the input from the sensor and the control system is critical to the operation of the
speciﬁc systems. The use of biologically inspired centralized and decentralized control architec-
tures offers advantages in speed of operation and simplicity of the selected control architecture. The
topic of vision as human sensing and its imitation were covered in Chapters 11 and 17 of this book.
.
Optimization tools and algorithms:
Various optimization tools have been developed using
biological models. As described in Chapters 4 and 5, the simulation of natural selection and
survival of the ﬁttest, which is the key to the process of evolution, has been adapted mathematically
in the form of genetic algorithm. To survive, individuals of any species must reproduce and
regenerate and this requires new members of the population to be ﬁt and adaptable to changing
environmental conditions. Only the ﬁttest individuals survive while the weak members perish or
are killed by their natural enemies. Inherent to the genetic algorithm approach is, the deﬁnition of
what features identify the ﬁttest, where in nature, the deﬁnition keeps evolving with changing
environmental conditions and across species. Unlike nature, in genetic algorithms the deﬁnition of
the ﬁttest is stability. By identifying the stable elements in a population, genetic algorithms allow
for the ultimate achievement of an ‘‘ideal’’ population and this is a situation that is not paralleled in
nature.
.
Machine–human interaction:
Intuitive interaction between human and machines is increasingly
becoming an issue of attention of computer and instrument manufactures. As efforts are made to
reach consumers outside the pool of high-tech individuals, it is increasingly critical to make
human–machine interaction more users friendly. To address this need many computer monitors
and input pads are equipped with touch screen capability. Systems with voice recognition are
becoming a standard in information services that are provided over the phone. When calling your
bank, airline, phone operator, and many businesses today you are greeted by a computer operator
that interacts with you and understands your answers from a selected menu of choices. In parallel,
efforts are underway to develop robots that can recognize body language and emotional expressions
(sad, happy, etc.) and respond accordingly (Chapter 6; Bar-Cohen and Breazeal, 2003). Other forms
of interaction that are emerging include direct control from the human brain to allow disabled
individuals to operate independently.
20.4
TURNING SCIENCE FICTION INTO ENGINEERING REALITY
Biology is ﬁlled with solutions and inventions that has been the subject of mimicking and continues
to offer enormous potential for human-made mechanisms, tools, and algorithms (Benyus, 1998).
Some of the functions that are performed by creatures are far from becoming an engineering reality,
such as the octopus’ capability to travel through narrow passages signiﬁcantly smaller than its body
cross section. Making a robot that can camouﬂage itself as well as an octopus (Cott, 1938; Hanlon
et al., 1999) and defend itself with multiple tentacles using numerous suction cups and poisonous
needles offers enormous potential for homeland defense, but it is far from reality. Science-ﬁction
movies and literature have created a level of expectation for the ﬁeld of biomimetics and robotics
that is far from reality, though these expectations offer creative ideas. Employing biologically
inspired principles, mobility, sensing, and navigation are driving revolutionary capabilities in
emerging robots. Development in biomimetics may lead to a day when intelligent robots could
replace dogs, offering unmatched beneﬁts in terms of capability and intellectual support. It may
become possible to discuss with robots strategies for stock market investment, obtain advice about a
personal problem, or possibly debate philosophical thoughts and politics. Also, one may be able to
have the robot read books in any desired language, accent, or gender voice, and answer questions
about unclear words or sentence in a book, as well as provide related information and background.
The robot may be able to cheer you up, laugh when a funny situation occurs, smell and identify
odors, as well as taste food and provide detailed nutrition and health information. Being fully
autonomous, biomimetic robots would conduct self-diagnostics and go to the selected maintenance
Biomimetics: Reality, Challenges, and Outlook
501

facility for periodic checkup and possibly repair themselves as needed. Rapid prototyping will
enable fast development of this technology as improvements are introduced to the ﬁeld. While
many positive aspects may result from the development of such robots with humanistic capabilities
and behavior, negative issues may arise that will require attention. Such issues may include owner
liability in case of accident or ‘‘misbehavior’’ of the robot, as well as the potential use of robots for
unlawful acts.
For many years, the beneﬁciaries of biologically inspired robot have been the entertainment
industry, including toys and movies. Robots with biomimetic characteristics are becoming popular
consumer products, reﬂecting the public fascination with the realistic capabilities that can be
enabled in robots. Such products include robotic toys such as the Mattel’s Miracle Moves Baby,
which was created and developed in partnership with TOYinnovation, Inc. Miracle Moves
Baby was introduced in 2001, and sold widely at its introduction. This doll wakes up the way a
real baby would, yawns, appears tired, sucks her bottle and her thumb, giggles, burps, and is rocked
to sleep in the most life-like manner.
Further, as the evolution in capability has increased it has reached the level that the more
sophisticated and demanding ﬁelds as space science are considering biomimetic robots. At the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, which is part of the NASA, four and six-legged robots have been under
development for future missions to Mars. Such robots include the Limbed Excursion Mobile Utility
Robot (LEMUR) and the Steep Terrain Access Robot (STAR) (Badescu et al., 2005). These types
of robots are developed to travel across rough terrain, acquire and analyze samples, and perform
many other functions that are attributed to legged animals including walking, grasping, object
manipulation, and wall climbing. Advances in this technology may potentially lead to future NASA
missions, in which operations could resemble a plot from a movie or science-ﬁction book more than
conventional mission operations. Equipped with multi-functional tools and multiple cameras, the
new models of LEMUR are intended to inspect and maintain installations beyond humans’ easy
reach. This robot has six legs, each of which has interchangeable end-effectors as required to
perform the required mission. The axi-symmetric layout is much like a starﬁsh or octopus, with a
panning camera system that allows omni-directional movement and manipulation operations.
Besides the possibility of robots that emulate human capabilities, science ﬁction also suggests
humans with supernatural capabilities. A human being with bionic muscles is synonymous with
superhuman characters in movies and TV series. Driven by bionic muscles, these characters are
portrayed as capable of strength and speeds that are far superior to humans. The development of
artiﬁcial muscles using electroactive polymers (EAP) materials has made the use of bionic muscles
a potential reality. These materials can induce large strains (stretching, contracting or bending) in
response to electrical stimulation (Bar-Cohen, 2004). EAP-based actuators may be used to elimin-
ate the need for gears, bearings, and other components that complicate the construction of robots,
reducing their costs, weight, size, and premature failures. Further, these materials can be used to
make biomimetic robots that appear and behave more realistically. Robots are being introduced
with increased capability and sophistication, including the ability to express emotions both verbally
and facially as well as respond emotionally to such expressions. The ﬁrst commercial product
driven by EAP that emerged in 2002 is a Fish-Robot (Eamex, Japan) that swims without a motor or
batteries. It uses EAP materials that simply bend upon stimulation. For power it uses inductive coils
that are energized from the top and bottom of the ﬁsh tank. This toy represents a major milestone for
the ﬁeld, making a very realistic looking ﬁsh.

Simulators and Virtual Robots
For many years, the entertainment industry has been imitating living creatures using numerous
forms that include puppets, cartoons, manikins, and others. Making animated movies is a well-
established industry with an extensive heritage, where artists draw creatures that represent living
animals, humans, or imagined creatures. These cartoon ﬁgures are made with biomimetic appear-
502
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

ance and behavior but with capabilities that are only limited by the artist’s imagination and
creativity. Generally, such animated creatures do not have to obey the laws of physics, and they
can perform unrealistic tasks that defy gravity and other forces of nature. However, cartoons can
indicate future advances in biomimetic technology. While the operation of biomimetic robots could
use some of the kinematic algorithms that are well developed by the animation industry, there are
many issues that need to be addressed when making actual robots. These issues include control,
stability, feedback, vibration suppression, effect of impact, power, mass, volume, obstacle avoid-
ance, environmental conditions, workspace, and other real-world requirements. In order to address
these issues without the costly process of making and testing real robots, one can use computer
simulations, in which the laws of physics are accurately represented.
Computer simulation has become a critical development tool that can be used to test the
behavior of simulated system and rapidly make modiﬁcations without the high cost of fabrication
and testing. The analytical phase is followed by rapid prototyping and other procedures of
accelerated software development. The development of computers and analytical tools, including
numerical and logical models, has made possible a very powerful simulated representation of real-
world activity. Such tools are used to investigate the performance of complex systems, and address
such parameters as thermal, aerodynamic, mechanics, material behavior, and time-dependent
effects. Also, electronic and mechanical issues of driving and operating the developed systems
can be integrated into the simulation model and studied on the computer. Testing a real-world
system can be prohibitively expensive, or even impossible for situations in which making changes
can be very difﬁcult and time consuming. Also, simulated testing to the point of failure can be
repeated many times without serious consequences to the tested systems. An example includes the
simulation of a car crash into a wall, in which safety engineers evaluate potential designs. The
advantage is that it reduces the number of real cars that may need to be instrumented and sacriﬁced.
Other examples of simulated systems include the response of an aircraft structure to bird strikes,
and the effect of loads on mechanical systems and new products. Because of the complexity of
products, their behavior cannot be perfectly modeled. Therefore, test products must still be
physically built and tested to destruction.
20.4.2
Robots as an Integral Part of our Society
Making biomimetic robots requires attention to technical, philosophical, and social issues. Inspir-
ation from science ﬁction sets expectations that will continually be bound by reality and the state of
the art. Making biomimetic robots is the electro-mechanical analog of biological cloning. Being
increasingly capable, the development of biomimetic robots, or the performance of artiﬁcial
cloning, raises issues of concern with regard to questionable implementations. This issue may
become a topic of public debate in years and may reach the level that is currently involved with the
topics of fetal stem cells and human cloning. As biomimetic robots with human characteristics are
becoming more an engineering reality, there may be a growing need to equip them with limited
self-defense and controlled-termination. In parallel, there may be a rise in potential use of such
robots for unlawful applications, and proper attention may be required by lawmakers to head off
this possibility in order to assure that such robots are used for positive applications. As this need
begins to rise, it will become more important to give serious attention to the laws of Asimov (1950)
that he deﬁned for robots. These laws address the human concern that robots may be designed to
harm people. According to these laws, the desired status of robots is as slaves to humanity, where
they are allowed to protect themselves only as long as no human is physically hurt. While these
laws reﬂect the desire to see ‘‘peaceful’’ robots as productive support tools it might not be realistic
to expect them to be designed only as Asimov’s law-obedient robots. One would expect that some
robots would be designed by various governments to perform military and law enforcement tasks
that may involve violation of these laws.
Biomimetics: Reality, Challenges, and Outlook
503

One can expect a revolution in our lives as such robots are developed to the point that they
become part of our daily activity. It would require the implementation of direct interaction schemes
that include the ability of robots to express themselves both in body language and verbal expres-
sions. Since different people view emotions and moods differently, users will need to have the
capability of user-friendly programming of the robot’s behavior, emotion, and mood. This may also
be provided through self-learning and adaptive behavior just as kids learn that which is appropriate
or acceptable and that which is not. Further, while computers will have superior capabilities over
humans, there will be a need to assure the social order with the clear role of robots as the slaves in
master–slave relation. A certain level of independence will need to be provided with a user-selected
autonomous operation vs. fully programmable performance depending on the desired task. Also,
robots will need to have selectable behavior speciﬁcations that deﬁne their desired personality. This
personality may include friendliness, and ‘‘cool’’ operations with various algorithms of human
interaction and behavior.
20.5
SMART STRUCTURES AND MATERIALS
The development of smart materials has been the objective of researchers and engineers for over
three decades. Materials, systems, and structures are identiﬁed as smart if they can interact with the
environment and have an ability to predict the required future actions and to respond to change in
various ways. Adaptive capabilities have already been implemented in commercial materials. For
instance, liquid crystals are used to indicate changes in temperature, and there are commercially
available optical glasses that become dark with the increase in light intensity. To behave ‘‘smart’’
beyond the simple reactions to a speciﬁc condition, as sunglasses change their shade, it is necessary
to provide systems with the ability to learn the required response to various stimulations from the
environment and be capable of predicting future conditions and prepare to respond optimally.
It would be interesting to develop systems with individual characteristics that would be the
result of learning from the environment in which they operate and exhibit relatively wide variety of
shapes while still working properly. It may be feasible to deﬁne structures in terms of the ability to
carry loads and the positions or places where it can hold or place objects. Thus, such systems would
not need to be engineered to high tolerances, yet they will learn how to functionally deal with the
design details. Such development will require taking advantage of the increasingly evolving nano-
technology, where minute sensors will be integrated throughout the structure to provide informa-
tion and feedback for smart control. Ultimately, such smart structures would need to design and
construct themselves using resources from the environment or redistribute their structural materials
to allow effective handling of large loads. Such an approach would enable producing lighter and
safer structures that eliminate stress concentrations, perform optimally, and operate with long life
duration. Structures will need to be designed with scalability in mind to allow adapting the
technology to various aspects of our daily lives. An interesting distinction between biological
structures with bones compared to robots is the fact that the biological elements are not rigidly
connected. It would be a challenge for future roboticists to develop robots that have such a
structural ﬂexibility of being an integrated system while still able to carry loads, move rapidly,
and perform all these functions that we recognize as biological.
20.6
IMPACT OF BIOMIMETICS ON NONENGINEERING FIELDS
Throughout the history of mankind, nature has been an inspiration to many nonengineering ﬁelds
including entertainment, toys, and art with the results well documented in such artistic objects as
paintings, statues, structures, and other artifacts. Engineering and art with biomimetic character-
istics are increasingly being integrated in the construction of modern buildings and other structures.
504
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

Examples of the inﬂuence of nature on construction are the architectural landmarks such as the
Sydney Opera House in Australia and the Esplanade Theater in Singapore. The Sydney Opera
House has an artistic conﬁguration of sea shells. It was originally designed by the Danish architect
Joern Utzonhas and opened in 1973. The construction of the Esplanade Theater in Singapore was
inﬂuenced by the durian fruit (see Figure 20.3, right). In Singapore, this fruit is considered the king
of fruits — it is sweet, spiky, and weighs about 1 to 2 kg. It is native to Malaysia and Indonesia,
green to brown in color, oblong to round in shape, prickly with strong sharp thorns, emitting a
strong, distinctive smell that puts most foreigners off. For this reason, in Singapore it is forbidden to
carry it on public transportation such as aircraft and subway. The durian fruit inspired the
construction of the Esplanade Theater that was opened in October 2002. This building consists of
two domes having the shape of this fruit with durian-like spikes that are used as sun shields (see
Figure 20.3, left). Due to its shape this theater is also known as the Durians Building.
Another example shown in Figure 20.4 is the beech (Fagus sylvaticus) leaf (Kobayashi et al.,
1998), which serves as an inspiring model. The leaves of the beech emerge from the bud by
unfolding its corrugated surface (Figure 20.4a). Interestingly, the leaf uses high angle folds to allow
it to be folded more compactly within the bud, though this arrangement it requires more time to
expand. This may be needed to allow the plant to optimize the timing of the leaf deployment with
ecological and physiological conditions. An artistic object that mimicked this leaf is shown in
Figure 20.4b. Called the ‘‘Leaf-Mat’’, it was created as a folding mat for children’s play-time and it
consists of a polypropylene base and felt.
Another area that mimics biology is economy. In nature, entities compete for energy, while in an
economy they compete for money (Mattheick, 1994; Vincent, 2001). Plants compete to grow higher
in order to gain more sunlight, while animals compete for territory, sex, and food. On the other hand,
industry competes for customers to assure survival and growth. In business, if a company cannot
survive competition in the changing environment of the marketplace, it goes bankrupt, analogous to
death in biology. The use of subsidies to support small companies can be viewed as similar to a small
plant that is supported with a stick or animal that is helped by its parents in its early stages. These
animals and plants need to learn to operate independently; otherwise they will require support
throughout their life and will never be able to handle the tough challenges of the real world.
As mentioned in Chapter 1, the use of terminologies that are biologically inspired makes
communication of complex details easier to understand. Examples include the use of the terms
male and female for plugs, erection of structures to describe their construction, head or tail for the
location in a structure and many other such terms. Increased use of such terms can be highly
beneﬁcial to improvement in communication, training, and friendliness of users’ manual for
Figure 20.3 (See color insert following page 302)

Esplanade Theater (left) has the shape of this fruit that is considered the king of fruits (right). (The photo on the

operation of new instruments. The interface of machine and humans is becoming increasingly
complicated, but the instructions for using them can be simpliﬁed by using biological terms and
principles. One can make new instruments more intuitive if concepts from nature are used, making
it easier to ‘‘ﬁgure out’’ how the instrument works, thereby reducing instructions or training.
20.7
HUMAN DEVIATION FROM NATURE MODELS
In order to ensure both the short-term existence and long-term species sustainability, all organisms
must grow, maintain existence, feed, and reproduce. Generally, most organisms meet their basic life
needs within the boundaries of the habitat in which they live. If they cannot compete in this habitat,
then they must either adapt a different strategy, move to a different habitat in which they can
compete, or die. In the short term, the adaptation capability of individual organisms helps species
survive if followed by genetic modiﬁcations that sustain the long-term survival of the species. The
speciﬁc characteristics of the adaptation are determined by the constraints of the environment and
the genetic make up of the speciﬁc species.

Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

For many thousands of years, humans lived harmoniously with nature and migrated periodically
allowing for nature to recover from the damage to the speciﬁc habitat. As the human race advanced
its capability, efforts have increasingly been made to deviate from the process of evolution. We have
signiﬁcantly extended our life, increased our survival rate, reduced our reproduction, and stopped
migrating to allow recovery of our habitats. Also, we are using signiﬁcant amount of energy,
consuming oil at enormous levels, processing our food, polluting the environment with nondegrad-
able chemicals, changing the temperatures around us, affecting the weather (e.g., inducing rain),
blocking or diverting the path of rivers, bringing many species to extinction, destroying the ozone
layer, and doing so many other things that affect our environment in nonreversible ways. The
pollution that we have released into our environment has reached levels where every aspect of our
life has been impacted including the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. For
example, there are some ﬁsh that are not recommended for consumption because of the levels of toxic
chemicals in their system, including mercury, PCB, and others. In deﬁance of other organisms, we
often adapt our environments to suit ourselves and even change those constraints that are supposed to
make us adapt to the environment. Effectively, we are operating against the laws of biology and
pushing the limits of our existence. However, we are also increasingly becoming aware of these facts
and making greater efforts to live more in harmony with nature. There are examples now of our
efforts to ensure our own sustainability with many success stories. These include increased use of
biodegradable materials, making and operating mechanisms that consume energy more efﬁciently,
recycling our resources, and protecting the ozone layer from our pollution and chemicals.
Biomimetics can provide an important guide in our efforts to live harmoniously with nature
(Benyus, 1998). We can learn from plants how to use the Earth’s pollution that is in the form of CO2
to produce oxygen, which is also critical to human life. Also, plants pump water and minerals from
the ground to great heights and use these as resource for growth and also as a source of energy that is
completely Earth-friendly, that is, solar energy. Another example is nature’s recycling of its
resources where plants are eaten by plant-eaters, which in turn are consumed by predators whose
bodies decompose to fertilize plants. The mimicking of this recycling process can be seen in
the recycling of trash to produce recycled materials as well as energy and it is one of the human
success stories.
20.8
PRESENT TECHNOLOGY, FUTURE POSSIBILITIES, AND POTENTIALS
The focus of this book has been on the making of technologies that one can label ‘‘artiﬁcial’’ as
opposed to the ones that are known as ‘‘natural’’. Parallel to the efforts to mimic biology in
engineering and science terms, there are also efforts to create synthetic systems that include making
cells, tissues, and in future years, possibly organs. Although the latter is a form of mimicking nature
it is outside the scope of this book.
Developing biomimetic mechanisms requires employing many disciplines, tools, and capabil-
ities. It involves materials, actuators, sensors, structures, control, and autonomous operations. As
described in this book, mimicking nature has immensely expanded the collection of tools that are
available to us in performing tasks that were once considered science ﬁction. As technology
evolves, increasing numbers of biologically inspired mechanisms and functions that emulate the
capability of creatures and organisms are expected to emerge. The challenges to making such
biomimetic technologies that are copied or adapted depend on the complexity that is involved.
Many examples of biomimetic applications that are currently in use or expected to emerge in future
were described and discussed in this book. Other examples may include marine vehicles that mimic
shark skin by having low friction surface in water or use antifreeze proteins found in some marine
creatures allowing them to sustain temperatures below freezing points.
One of the emerging areas of biomimetics is artiﬁcial muscles, a moniker for electroactive
polymers (EAP). It offers enormous potential for many areas of our life. The easy capability to
Biomimetics: Reality, Challenges, and Outlook
507

produce EAP materials in various shapes can be exploited to make future mechanisms and devices
using such methods as stereolithography and ink-jet printing techniques. A polymer can be
dissolved in a volatile solvent and ejected drop-by-drop onto various substrates. Such processing
methods offer the potential of making systems and robots in full 3D details that include EAP
actuators allowing rapid prototyping and quick mass production (Bar-Cohen, 2004). A possible
vision for such technology can be the fabrication of insect-like robots that can be made to ﬂy and
pack themselves into a box, ready for shipping, once they are made. These miniature robots may
help to inspect hard-to-reach areas of aircraft structures, where they can be launched to conduct the
required inspection procedures and download information about the structure integrity. Other
examples can be the rapid prototyping of robots with controlled characteristics that follow speciﬁc
movie scripts and with the appearance and behavior of the desired artiﬁcial actors. The robots’
appearance and behavior can be modiﬁed rapidly as needed for the evolving script, and when
changes need to be made, the artiﬁcial actors can be rapidly produced with any desired modiﬁca-
tion. Using effective EAP actuators to mimic nature would immensely expand the collection and
functionality of devices and mechanisms that are currently available. Important addition to this
capability can be the application of telepresence combined with virtual reality using haptic
interfaces (Mavroidis et al., 2004). While such capabilities are expected to signiﬁcantly change
future robots, additional effort is needed to develop robust and effective EAP-based actuators.
Considering the current limitations of artiﬁcial muscles and their capability to support biomi-
metic applications, the author posed a challenge to the worldwide science and engineering
community to develop a robotic arm that is actuated by artiﬁcial muscles to win an arm-wrestling
match against a human opponent (Figure 20.5) (Chapter 10; Bar-Cohen, 2004). The ﬁrst compe-
tition was held on March 7, 2005 during the EAP Session of the SPIE’s EAP Actuators and Devices
(EAPAD) Conference, which is part of the Smart Structures and Materials Symposium. As
described in Chapter 10, three EAP-actuated arms wrestled against a 17-year-old female student
who won all three matches. Progress in making robotic arms that win a match against humans will
lead to signiﬁcant beneﬁts, particularly in the medical area of effective prosthetics. A remarkable
contribution would be to see a disabled person jogging to the grocery store using this technology.
Figure 20.5 (See color insert following page 302)
Grand challenge for the development of EAP-actuated
robotics.
508
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

It would lead to exciting new generations of robots that can change our daily life; possibilities would
include robots as a household assistant and intelligent companion replacing the dog as ‘‘man’s best
friend.’’ Another important beneﬁt that may be achieved with success in winning this challenge
would be a milestone demonstration of the capability to produce superior biomimetic robots.
Availability of strong and robust artiﬁcial muscles may enable future years to produce biomi-
metic legged robots that can run as fast as a cheetah, carry mass like a horse, climb steep cliffs like a
gecko, reconﬁgure its body like an octopus, ﬂy like a bird, and dig tunnels like a gopher. This is an
incredible vision of robots that can potentially be used in future exploration of planets in the
universe leading to future NASA mission plans that may include a script for the robots operation
that may follow science-ﬁction ideas. Hopefully, these robots will be able to operate autonomously,
detecting water, various resources, and possibly even biological indicators of past or present life.
They may even be able to construct facilities for future human habitats.
20.9
AREAS OF CONCERNS AND CHALLENGES TO BIOMIMETICS
Throughout this book there are descriptions and discussions of many examples of concepts,
devices, and mechanisms that were mimicked or inspired by biology. One of the amazing capabil-
ities of nature that were described include the spider’s ability to create in room temperature and
pressure, incredibly ﬂat and strong web structures that are durable in outdoor conditions. The
spider’s web may have inspired the ﬁshing net, the fabric of the clothing that we wear, and many
other things that we use in our daily life. In some cases, the possibilities seen in nature have allowed
us to make things with far superior capabilities. For example, human efforts to copy birds’ wings in
order to produce a ﬂying machine led to very limited capabilities as was demonstrated in the late
1880s and 1890s by Horatio Phillips and Otto Lilienthal. Only after we mastered aerodynamic
principles we managed to make ﬂying machines far superior to birds. Aircraft capabilities are an
incredible human success that far exceeded capabilities of any ﬂying creature that ever existed. This
includes ﬂying signiﬁcantly higher and faster, and carrying far more load as aircrafts have
enormous volume as we can see in airports today. The only thing airplanes cannot do yet is
perch on a wire (though microplanes now under development may end up doing just that).
Some human inventions that appear biomimetic may have not necessarily been the result of an
actual adaptation of nature’s ideas (Altshuller, 1988). The process of innovation and introduction of
invention by humans as problem solvers can be difﬁcult to trace. In some tools, nature may not have
been the immediate model, and similarities may just be coincidental. Honeycombs, used in many
aircraft structures (Gordon, 1976) may not have been directly inspired by the honeycombs made by
the bees; however, it is still the same structure and the aircraft structure’s name is the same as the
product made by the bees. The potential of reinventing nature’s innovation may be reduced if these
inventions can be documented, not as biological observations but as engineering mechanisms and
tools. Effectively, there is a need to establish a database and handbooks that logically catalog
nature’s capabilities, speciﬁcations, mechanisms, processes, tools, and functions in terms of
principles, materials, dimensions, limitations, etc. Such documented information, which can be
produced by biologists for use by engineers, may greatly help humans in making novel biomimetic
inventions. Working towards such an objective, one can consider nature in technological terms,
while possibly considering the use of a uniﬁed approach to describe biological inventions. Such
documentation might help to accelerate advances in human-made technologies.
The December 2004 tsunami disaster caused over two hundred thousand casualties and led
to million homeless people, where in contrast very few animals died. This fact suggests that
humans have lost the ability to sense and be forewarned of such natural calamities. It is difﬁcult
to believe that such a sensing capability can be reacquired by humans and therefore alternative
detection techniques are needed. Most countries do not have the required monitoring system due to
the very high associated cost and the fact that such disaster may occur once in tens or hundreds of
Biomimetics: Reality, Challenges, and Outlook
509

years. Adapting the sensing capability of animals would potentially lead to affordable detection
technology.
Nature offers many capabilities that are unique to some species, and understanding the require-
ments for their adaptation can help us in many ways. Some of these capabilities are still mysteries
that can offer enormous potential for humans. One may wonder about bears’ ability to sleep for
6 months without urinating and poisoning its blood. For medical applications, learning the clues to
this capability may help ﬁght diabetes. The ability of the lizard to drop its tail as a decoy in case of
danger, and grow it back without scars is another important model for the ﬁeld of medicine.
Adapting this capability can help heal the disabled and severely injured.
20.10
CONCLUSION
Over the 3.8 billion years of evolution, nature has come up with inventions that are great models for
imitation and adaptation. Nature consists of a large pool of inventions although it has its own
evolution drawbacks including that nature is irreversible, cannot be planned and has crevasses in its
solution space. The ﬁeld of biomimetics is multidisciplinary requiring the use of expertise from
biology, engineering, computational and material sciences, robotics, neuroscience, biomechanics,
and many other related ﬁelds. Further, several disciplines have emerged in recent years as a result of
the effort to develop biomimetic systems. The technology requires the ability to produce scaleable
mechanisms ranging from miniature — as small as nanometers scale — to giant sizes — as large as
several meters. There are still numerous challenges, but the recent trends in the ﬁeld of biomimetics
— international cooperation, the greater visibility of this area of study and the surge in funding of
related research projects — offer great potential.
Nature uses minimum resources to produce maximum results, and one of the characteristics of
this aspect is the effective packing and deployment techniques that have been used by nature
allowing organisms to be ﬁtted for the environment in which they need to operate. As seen
throughout this book, both plants and animals have used various techniques of packing where
ﬂowers and leaves grow from a highly packed structure in the bud. Further, animals are using
appendages for locomotion that are conﬁgured in easy-to-deploy structures, which include the ﬁns,
legs and wings (Kresling, 2000). Beside the inspiration of effective robots, there are numerous other
inventions and mechanisms that one can be inspired to develop using such packing techniques. One
may consider deployable structures that can include tents and other large surface foldable structures
as well as gossamer structures and deployable antennas for space applications. For commercial
applications and user-friendly household products one may consider future improvements to such
tools as the food mixer that has many parts and need to be assembled and disassembled each time
the mixer is used. One may think of integrated parts that can be deployed like the wings of the bird.
Another example can be vacuum cleaners that also consist of many parts which can be easily and
rapidly deployed when needed and packed and stowed when not.
There are many areas where nature is superior, and one example is the ability to recognize
patterns and objects. We can recognize people whom we have not seen for years and who may have
grown quite older and changed signiﬁcantly and we can do so even from some distance. Efforts
have been done to develop such a technology of face recognition at airports as part of the US
homeland defense technology. While signiﬁcant success was observed in the early tests, the
systems that were installed at airports for face recognition were removed. This has been the result
of the many false positive indications that have been encountered.
One can ﬁnd many examples in our daily life where human-made technology can be traced to
nature’s inventions that were mimicked or used as an inspiration. These include many aspects of
science and engineering and learning how to do more will help humans even further. In this age of
international terror and with the need for more innovative homeland security and defense tools one
may want to examine nature’s techniques and investigate the possibilities of learning more.
510
Biomimetics: Biologically Inspired Technologies

We have learned to use various techniques of camouﬂage, shields and body armor as well as the
stings and barbed arrows and there should be many more ideas that we can mimic.
As we learn from nature we are becoming better able to implement the adapted inventions
into the world of artiﬁcial tools that we create and continue to improve. The cover page graphics
(see the top panel of Figure 20.6) shows an illustration of human learning to make tools by watching
nature. This idea can be turned into a vision for the future of the artiﬁcial world that we are
continuing to create and improve as illustrated at the bottom panel of Figure 20.6. In this ﬁgure, an
evolutionary chain of the inspiration of nature is drawn where technology that we learned from
nature is implemented into robot’s end-effectors including robotic arms, manipulators, and other
biomimetic support ﬁxtures.
For the question ‘‘what else can we learn?’’ it would be highly helpful to create a documented
database that would examine biology from an engineering point of view and offer possibly a
catalog of nature’s inventions. This catalog needs to include the inventions that have already been
used and possibly even offer different ways of looking at nature’s innovations to enrich other
ﬁelds that have not been beneﬁted yet. This database can be documented in a format of webpages
with hyperlinks that crossrefer related information. An example of a tool for documenting the
database one can use the Wiki online database system (see for more information: http://wiki.org/
wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki).

Biomimetics: Reality, Challenges, and Outlook
511

There are many challenges to mimicking nature but the possibilities are endless. As long as we
would not reach the level of having a chip grows from a micron size in a hibernated state to an
active fully grown robot that is highly intelligent and autonomous, biomimetics will still be a useful
source of inspiration for inventors. Success in developing and implementing nature’s ideas will
bring science ﬁction and imaginations to engineering reality. One of the great challenges to
imitating biology is to create robots that mimic such creatures as octopus. This would mean having
robots that are highly ﬂexible and dexterous that operate intelligently and autonomously with the
capability to crawl through very narrow strips, camouﬂage its body by matching the colors, shape
and texture of the surrounding, be equipped with multiple tentacles and suction cups for gripping on
objects, using ink as a smoke screen, see clearly without blind spots, and having many other
capabilities and multifunctional components that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
The future of biomimetics is quite exciting but it is hard to predict what would be learned or
mimicked next. One can envision in the years to come that many more tools and capabilities will
emerge in every scale of our life from nano levels to macro and beyond. The beneﬁts can be
expected in such areas as medical, military, consumer products, and many others.

Figure 8.4
Two distinct classes of self-assembling peptide construction motifs are shown here. (a) The ﬁrst class
belongs to amphiphilic peptides that form well-ordered nanoﬁbers. These peptides have two distinctive sides, one
hydrophobic and the other hydrophilic. The hydrophobic side forms a double sheet inside of the ﬁber and hydrophilic
side forms the outside of the nanoﬁbers that interact with water molecules that they can form extremely high water
content hydrogel, containing as high as 99.9% water. At least three types of molecules can be made, with , þ, /þ
on the hydrophilic side. (b) The second class of self-assembling peptide belongs to surfactant-like molecules. These
peptides have a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail, much like lipids or detergents. They sequester their
hydrophobic tail inside of micelle, vesicles or nanotube structures and expose their hydrophilic heads to water. At
least three kinds molecules can be made, with , þ, /þ heads.

Figure 8.5
The bacterial ribosome. 30S ribosome (left panel) and 50S ribosome (right panel). The ribosome is one
of the most sophisticated molecular machines nature has ever self-assembled. It has more than 50 different kinds of
proteins and 3 different size and functional RNAs, all through weak interactions to form the remarkable assembly
line. (Source: http://www.molgen.mpg.de/~ag_ribo/ag_franceschi/.)
Figure 8.8
When primary rat hippocampal neuron cells are allowed to attach to the peptide scaffolds, the neuron
cells not only project lengthy axons that follow the contours of the scaffold surface, but also form active and
functional synaptic connections, each green dot is a functional neuronal connection (upper panel). Furthermore,
when the peptide scaffold was injected into brain of animals, it bridged the gap and facilitated the neural cells to
migrate cross the deep canyon (lower panel). The animals regained their visual function. Without the peptide
scaffold, the gap remains, and the animals did not regain visual function.

Muscle Bioreactor Technology. Muscle identiﬁcation, control and maintenance apparatus is shown
with the primary sensors and actuators noted. The coarse positioning stage is adjusted at the beginning of the
experiment to accommodate different tissue lengths, but is typically kept at a constant position during a particular
contraction. The primary stage provides the motion that simulates the boundary condition force law with which the
muscle specimen pulls against. The vertical syringe has a suction electrode at its tip that is connected to the
stimulation electronics in the background. The encoder and load cell measure muscle displacement and force,
respectively, and are employed as sensory control inputs during FES control experimentation. Silicone tubing
recirculates solution via a peristaltic pump, while oxygen is injected in the loop.

attached to either side of elastomeric tail (2), alternately contract to move the tail back and forth through a
surrounding ﬂuid medium. Two electrodes per muscle (3), attached near the myotendonous junction, are used to
stimulate the tissues and to elicit contractions. To depolarize the muscle actuators, two lithium ion batteries (4) are
attached to the robot’s frame (5). During performance evaluations, the robot swam through a glucose-ﬁlled ringer
solution to fuel muscle contractions.

The human eye in cross section with an enlarged section of the retina (right). The light sensitive
retina covers more than half the back of the eye. Over 100 million photoreceptors convert light into neural signals
that are then transmitted to the proximal visual centers by the optic nerve. The optic nerve is composed of 1 million
axons from the retinal ganglion cells, which are the output cells of the retina. In outer retinal diseases, the
photoreceptors are degenerated, but the inner retina cells remain and can be electrically stimulated.

A stable, erect sunﬂower stem (left panel) depends on the pressure of internal, easily expandable
hydrostat tissue (pith ¼ transparent cells in center panel) that tensions the stronger-walled surface layers of
the stem giving them rigidity and stability. The well-known limp shape of wilting young plant stems (right
panel) occurs when the internal, thin-walled pith tissue dehydrates, shrinks (center panel) and ceases to exert
radial pressure on the surface layer under tension. Left panel shows fully hydrated sunﬂower stem and right
panel a dehydrated stem; the center panel demonstrates volume reduction in pith during dehydration of a segment
slice. Pith parenchyma acts as a hydrostat motor that provides herbaceous stems with stability and the driving force
for expansion.
Figure 19.13
Leaves of Venus ﬂytraps have large, powerful motor cells in their center. The rapid expansion of
these cells is modiﬁed by different extensibilities of the two adjacent surface (epidermis) layers. These anisotropic
restraints turn a linear expansion into the rapid curving of the leaf and closure of the trap. This mechanism is
triggered when the sensory hairs at the upper surface are repeatedly touched.

The shoots of desert plants in the Cactus and Euphorbia families often adopt the shape of pleated
columns (a) a structure which allows the photosynthesizing periphery to maintain its area in spite of massive
volume losses in the shoot center. Cross sections of a pleated-column shoot show increasing dehydration from
upper to lower pictures (b) with a considerable volume loss of the shoot center (c) and remarkably constancy in the
area of a surface that changes its shape from a convex to a concave outline.
