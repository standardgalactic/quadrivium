SYSTEMS (IDPS)
IDPS plays a crucial role in identifying and
thwarting attacks in real-time, serving as a
vigilant sentinel against the relentless efforts
of cybercriminals.
Regular updates, continuous monitoring, and
proactive maintenance are vital to keeping your
defense mechanisms effective. 
NIDPS focuses on monitoring network traffic for
suspicious behavior, while HIDPS resides within
individual systems, providing detailed insights
into system-level activities.
