EDITOR’S NOTE
A WORD 
FROM
THE 
EDITORIAL 
TEAM
Editor’s Review pg.60
H
ello from the team! 
Happy August. This month we are celebrating 60 
years of independence for Malaysia. 
Merdeka means different things for different 
people. In the last six decades, we have seen rapid growth 
and development in the technology sector. Malaysia is now 
recognised as one of the most progressive country in Southeast 
Asia, with a tech savvy population. With telco and data coverage 
across most parts of the nation, Malaysia has one of the most 
connected population; most Malaysian residents own at least one 
mobile device. 
To pay tribute to 60 years of transformation, we have a 
special supplement in the magazine starting from page 42 – where 
we will feature some of the tech companies that have set up their 
operations in Malaysia, to grow their footprint around the region. 
Speaking of a connected age, we are a generation 
of sharers. Social media has made it easy for us to share our 
best moments; it comes with dangers as well. With SnapChat 
introducing SnapMaps, we look at whether location based sharing 
is more helpful or harmful. All this on page 37. 
Another notable anniversary this month, we look at the 
Cupertino giant’s well-loved handset – the iPhone. It’s been 10 
years since Steve Jobs first introduced the revolutionary phone 
back in 2007, and has since set the standards for smartphones 
today. In anticipation of the 10th anniversary device slated to be 
announced later this year, we round up some neat gadgets that will 
complement the latest release. Turn to page 51 for our op-ed and 
page 52 for the gadgets.
In our showdown this month, we pitted mini PCs head to 
head. These machines might be small, but they pack a punch! 
Forget 22-inch towers, these 4-inch boxes can handle your daily 
workloads like a dream and perhaps even support some gaming if 
you so wish. Find out which came up top at page 87. 
Finally, the popular Crash Bandicoot makes an appearance 
on page 103, where we reviewed the latest remastered version of 
the classic game. 
It’s a packed month, we hope you enjoy what we have in 
store for you. Signing off, till next month!

To Ryzen or Not to Ryzen ?
LETTER 
OF THE 
MONTH
It’s definitely recommended. A HDD made for NAS is designed for continuous up time for extended periods of 
time. Besides being reliable for 24/7 usage, a NAS HDD would be optimised for performance as well as vibration 
tolerance – so your disk isn’t just speedy, it would be less prone to wear and tear compared to a regular hard disk. 
Well….it really boils down to “What is your budget?” We do find that the Ryzen platform to be very, very good 
option if you want to buy and build a budget machine. It can even go head-to-head with Intel at their best, and 
this is even before overclocking is thrown into the mix. The only factor that can make or break your decision is 
that the Ryzen family is still new, so not many products are out in the market now. But even so, they have the best 
combination of latest technology, features and great value for your wallet. You can read our Ryzen reviews in the 
magazine and online, to see how the new products can fit into your need.

printer range designed for creative and 
printing houses looking to open up new 
opportunities and revenue streams for 
their businesses. Thanks to its low upfront 
cost, the Pro9000 series is ideal for light 
production and graphics art printouts 
where top-notch quality is paramount over 
high volume. The A3 printer series delivers 
high-quality prints with a low cost-per-page

creative businesses looking to offer more.
“The new Pro9000 Series from 
OKI offers local printing companies and 
creative businesses the flexibility to 
take creative printing to a whole new 
level. It also improves their own business 
performance thanks to the vibrant 
four and five-colour technology and 
innovative printing processes available

– Malaysia Rep Office.
The printers in the Pro9000 series

to 1,200 x 1,200 dpi, output prints as 
fast as 50 pages per minute (ppm) and 
can handle a wide variety of media up to

Hello, internet!
The internet can be a daunting place. 
Sometimes you just want to get things done.

he age of virtual reality (VR) and 
augmented reality (AR) is already 
upon us, and ASUS has jumped 
onto the bandwagon. The ASUS 
ZenFone AR is the world’s first Tango-enabled 
smartphone, as well as being optimised with 
the Google Daydream VR headset.
Retailing at RM3,799, the ZenFone 
AR features a Snapdragon 821 processor 
with 64-bit quad-core CPU, which has 
been optimised for Tango. An Adreno 
530 GPU is added for enhanced graphics 
while the display is a 5.7-inch WQHD 
Super AMOLED with a Corning Gorilla 
Glass 4 cover glass for better protection. 
Another outstanding feature is its 8GB 
RAM, something that is still uncommon 
in smartphones.
The ZenFone AR boasts a TriCam 
System, featuring a motion-tracking camera 
to better understand its movements, 
a depth-sensing camera with an 
infrared (IR) projector to measure its 
distance from real-world objects and a 
23-megapixels PixelMaster camera. It 
comes with a Sony IMX 318 sensor, f/2.0 
aperture, 6p Largan lens and a Sapphire 
cover glass for protection. There is also 
a 4-axis OIS for steadier photos paired 
with a 3-axis EIS for shake-free videos.
While it is the perfect combination 
for the Google Daydream, the ZenFone 
AR will not be made available with 
the VR headset as it has yet to make 
its way to Malaysian shores. Although 
the ZenFone AR can be used with other 
VR headsets like the HTC Vive and the 
Oculus Rift, it will not be at its full 
potential as the phone is calibrated to 
work best with the Google Daydream.

Is It A TV? Is It 
an Artwork?
Samsung shows off The Frame to Malaysia 
amsung just unveiled a TV that 
could have very easily been 
mistaken for an artwork. The 
Frame will soon be available for 
Malaysians to decorate their houses with – 
or to confuse unsuspecting guests.
Redefining the way we view TVs, 
The Frame is designed not only as a 
functional screen that allows users to 
enjoy their favourite entertainment; it 
is also a statement piece for displaying 
customisable art pieces at home.
The Frame comes in 55-inch and 65-
inch models. Unlike conventional TVs, The 
Frame doesn’t fade to black when powered 
off – rather, the display transforms into 
bespoke works of art. Through the Art 
Mode feature, The Frame can display a 
choice of 100 exclusive works of art by 37 
renowned designers or family photos; all 
controlled using a smartphone application.
The display is equipped with a 
brightness sensor, allowing for the contents 
that are displayed on screen to adjust 
to natural levels of lights in the room, 
S
providing the illusion of a picture frame on 
the wall. To further integrate the design 
of the TV with other interior, it comes 
with customisable frames which includes 
Walnut, Beige wood and White.
The setup of the TV is also designed 
to be simple, claiming to require only 
15-minutes to mount the TV onto the 
No Gap Wall-mount. The mount uses 
a universal mount system built into the 
back, allowing for easy adjusting after 
being positioned on the wall. As the name 
suggests, the No Gap Wall-mount allows 
the TV to be positioned flushed against the 
wall. With Invisible Connection, The Frame 
also eliminates messy cables, bringing a 
clean feel for the home.
The Frame will make its debut 
in Malaysia on 15 August 2017 
with 
a 
recommended 
retail 
price 
of RM14,999 for the 65-inch model 
and RM9,999 for the 55-inch model.

Digi introduces its new 900MHz spectrum
ith the introduction of the new

forth to the public its newly activated 
900MHz spectrum. This provides mobile 
phone signals to reach outwards to offer 
wider coverage, especially to rural areas.
This goes together with the SBK line 
as most of its journey is done underground 
so Digi users will prosper from the new 
900MHz spectrum. The lower spectrum 
provides customers with better indoor 
coverage as it penetrates walls at a 
lower frequency. “We listen to what our 
customers want and indoor coverage is an 
area for improvement. With the 900MHz 
spectrum, we are confident of serving our 
customers better whether they are in the 
comfort of their living rooms or at work in 
office buildings,” says Kesavan Sivabalan, 
Digi’s Chief Technology Officer.
“With our current infrastructure in 
place, we are looking towards bringing 
more freedom to our customers so

Promise of Perfection
vivo brings its selfie game to the next level
Advertorial
C
oming from the same parent 
company 
(BBK 
Electronics), 
vivo must stand against other 
Chinese smartphone competitor to 
gain some traction in the ever-growing 
smartphone market. Although there is 
room for healthy competition, vivo has 
managed to hold its own in China and 
the rest of the world with the release 
of its latest smartphone, the vivo 
V5s. Dubbed as the ‘Perfect Selfie’ 
smartphone, vivo has marketed the 
V5s towards humanity’s inner demons: 
the need of perfection.
While most smartphones place 
emphasis on its rear camera, vivo 
took a different approach with the 
V5s and made its front-facing camera 
the unique feature. Its 20-megapixel 
IMX376 front camera sensor talks 
a big game with creating crystal 
clear selfies, promising to remove 
blemishes and scars while still looking 
natural. To capture even more light, 
the V5s features an updated Selfie 
Softlight flash to capture your radiant 
complexion in the most arduous of 
situations.
Of course, just because vivo 
placed more importance to its front-
facing camera, doesn’t mean it left 
the rear camera behind. Featuring 
a 13-megapixel shooter with PDAF 
technology, you will be able to capture 
all the special moments in your life. 
Burst mode on the rear camera lets 
you shoot in quick succession, giving 
you outstanding 52-megapixel pictures 
in stunning detail and clarity.
On an everyday basis, the V5s can 
hold its own thanks to its octa-core 
processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of 
internal storage space. Paired with 
FunTouch OS 3.0, the V5s comes with 
two distinctive features that keeps it 
apart from the hoi polloi. App Clone 
allows you to create an identical 
application with a different account 
so you can distinguish between work 
and personal while Smart Split 2.0 
takes multitasking to another level. 
You can now chat with your friends 
without having them disrupt your 
video streaming time.
When speed is of the essence, 
the V5s doesn’t crumble under 
pressure as it comes with the fastest 
fingerprint unlocking system at just 
0.2 seconds. However, when locked, 
the V5s is a sight for the eyes with 
its elegant U-shaped cover lines. 
The back panel meets the sides in 
seamlessly curved edges, giving you 
great comfort when holding as well 
as looking.

A Spark of Creativity
DJI brings forth a new mini drone
JI has once again sets itself at 
the pinnacle of drone technology 
with its latest addition: the DJI 
Spark. Comparing to the Mavic 
Pro and Phantom series, DJI takes a different 
route with the Spark, making it an affordable 
consumer drone - especially for beginners.
The Spark is the first consumer 
drone from DJI where users can control it 
via hand gestures. You can now signal the 
Spark to come closer, go further back and 
even take a picture. 
“Controlling a camera drone with hand 
movements alone is a major step towards 
making aerial technology an intuitive part of 
everyone’s daily life, from work and adventure 
to moments with friends and family,” says 
Kevin On, DJI’s Director of Communications.
Weighing only 300 grams with a small 
footprint, the Spark can be stored into the bag 
with ease. DJI introduces a new QuickShot 
Intelligent Flight Mode for the Spark 
where you can now create professional 
videos easily and on-the-go.
The four QuickShot modes are: Rocket, 
which sends the Spark straight up into the 
air with the camera pointed down; Dronie, 
flying up and away from your subject; 
Circle, where the Spark rotates around the 
subject; and Helix, which sends the Spark 
into a spiral away from the subject while 
flying upwards. Previous Intelligent Flight 
Modes such as TapFly and ActiveTrack are 
also included into the Spark.
You can now shoot in stabilised 
HD 1080p videos under normal flight 
mode with the Spark as it houses a 
camera with 1/2.3-inch CMOS sensor 
with 12-megapixels. Included with the 
camera is a 2-axis mechanical gimbal and 
UltraSmooth technology to ensure your 
videos are shake-free videos.
D
The Spark is available for RM2,288 
and comes in five different colours: Alpine 
White, Sky Blue, Meadow Green, Lava Red 
and Sunrise Yellow. The bundle includes an 
aircraft, a battery, a USB charger and three 
pairs of propellers. 
The Spark Fly More Combo will be 
available soon and will retail at RM3,188. It 
features an aircraft, two batteries, four pairs 
of propellers, a remote controller, propeller 
guards, a charging hub and a shoulder bag.

end. The wireless design of the Relays Sports 
Wireless allows it to be looped around the 
back of your neck and comes with up to eight

Keeping it Digitally Clean
Microsoft pushing awareness of best practices for using technology
he biggest source of malware 
attacks in Asia-Pacific is from 
non-genuine software. In light 
of the recent cyberattacks, 
Microsoft has invited regional media to 
Singapore to share findings on a report, as 
well as warn against careless practices. 
The study was commissioned by 
Microsoft and conducted by the National 
University of Singapore, which found 
that cybercriminals are compromising 
computers by embedding malware into 
pirated software. According to results of 
the study, without exception, websites 
that host pirated software download links 
comes with high security risks.
In Asia-Pacific alone, 60% of personal 
computers are not using genuine software; 
amongst those, 92% were infected with 
malware; this is an alarming number. 
The study was led by Associate 
Professor 
Biplab 
Sikdar 
from 
the 
Department 
of 
Electrical 
& 
Computer Engineering at NUS Faculty 
of Engineering. “What we would like to 
achieve with this report is to help users 
recognise that the personal and business 
risks and financial costs are always much 
higher than any perceived costs they 
save from using non-genuine software.”
In Asia, cultural perception plays 
a huge part in the effectiveness of these 
attacks. It’s not the question of whether 
the technology is available to provide that 
protection. In fact, most attacks are down to 
poor cyber hygiene. 
Cyber hygiene is a set of best practices 
when using technology; most users tend to 
cut corners, favouring convenience over 
cumbersome security practices. Often, 
hackers and organised cybercriminals target 
these vulnerabilities and human errors. 
“While 
cybersecurity 
defenses 
continue to evolve, users are slow at 
adapting, whereas cybercriminals are 
constantly advancing their attack vectors 
(malware strains) and delivery mechanisms.” 
says Keshav Dhakad, Assistant General 
Counsel & Regional Director, Digital Crimes 
Unit (DCU), Microsoft Asia.
When Wannacry spread across 
the globe, the vulnerability that was 
exploited were old Microsoft Windows 
systems that weren’t up to date with the 
latest patch. With the latest Windows 
10, Microsoft is aiming to roll out vital 
patches in real time, rather than a 
monthly Patch Tuesday update. 
Speaking with Michael Montoya, 
Microsoft’s Chief Security Advisor, Asia 
Enterprise Cybersecurity Group, he notes 
that while some non-critical patches will 
still be rolled out monthly, the approach 
they are taking with Windows 10 is to roll 
out real-time patches. 
With 
Microsoft 
rolling 
out 
emergency patches for Windows XP, 
which has long been unsupported in the 
wake of WannaCry, critics note it could 
breed complacency for companies. 
“In this case, we just thought it was 
the right thing to do.” Montoya explains. 
He emphasised that it is not wise to rely on 
the possibility that Microsoft will continue 
issuing emergency security patches. 
“There’s a concern that we are 
sending a bad message to the industry, 
saying that we well take care of you when 
there’s a big problem,” Montoya explains. 
“There’s a reason users haven’t moved from 
XP, and we have to understand that reason. 
But it’s a big risk for companies to take, 
thinking that Microsoft is going to continue 
to update out of date software.”

COVER 
STORY

In the day and age of the social media, is it that 
important to share your locations on the Internet?
Sharing Isn’t 
Always Caring
Teh Wi-Liam

 
n general, people tend to share too much on the 
internet. If you were to scroll through your Facebook 
feed right now, you would probably spot your friend’s 
ex-girlfriend’s cousin’s sister ranting away about how 
all men are pigs and deserve to be castrated. Aside from 
the usual ‘popcorn-grabbing’ moment, you will also see 
friends posting up statuses about a new café that opened 
in town, hawking beans, décor and concept design like 
many others. If you pay close enough attention, you will 
notice the area being geotagged as well.
What started out as a trend has since grown into a 
fully marketable option for marketing and advertising 
agencies, targeting milennials who are a weird bunch. They 
are constantly craving for attention and want to be seen 
in places that ‘social media influencers’ and key opinion 
leaders (KOLs) ferociously promote because they are the 
very definition of ‘cool’. But what happens when you share 
too much of your life on social media, especially when it 
comes to sharing your location with hundreds and thousands 
of followers, many of which you have never met before?
In the eyes or potential marketers and clients, having 
people geotag their locations are a great way to market 
themselves out at no extra charge. To them, it's free publicity 
and will take full advantage of it. This started to take shape 
in Malaysia with the help of Foursquare, a social media app 
that made checking-in to locations a competition between 
friends and strangers. The objective of Foursquare was to 
check-in to a specific location for a certain amount of times 
a day, which could lead you to being the 'King' of said area. 
While it all seemed fun and harmless as we fight against our 
friends for control over favourite hangout spots, we seem to 
forget that other people could also see our locations, which 
could lead to trouble.
One minute, you could be enjoying a drink with a 
friend and next, four random strangers are seated beside 
you, trying their hardest to keep their gaze off of you. It 
paints a very grim picture, but that is our reality these 
days. What more now with the Snapchat and its latest 
feature – Snap Map.
For those who are unsure, Snapchat is a popular social 
media app founded by Evan Spiegel and allows users to post 
up snippets of their lives in a short 10-second video. Called 
Snaps, the app was also famous for its unique feature during 
its prime where users could chat back and forth whilst 
sending pictures and videos with no conversation history. 
If one were to even take a screenshot of a conversation 
or someone’s Snapchat story, the user who posted it will 
receive a notification, thus protecting said user from any

COVER STORY
 possible incriminating evidence. However, this allowed for 
some nefarious activities to go down but we shall save that 
for another time.
Having lost ground against Instagram and the craze of 
Insta Stories, Snapchat needed to come back into the game 
and it did so with the introduction of Snap Map. This allowed 
users to check out where exactly their friends are through a 
virtual map in real-time. The bojio-ness is real.
Sure, the initial reactions of Snap Map made for some 
compelling Internet jokes and memes but below the surface 
is where trouble brews. Being able to see where your friends 
are one thing, but a girl/guy you have been developing a 
crush on that’s bordering on psychotic? That’s where things 
start to spiral out of control.
As a socially acceptable member of society, no one in 
their right state of mind and sanity would want to commit such 
crimes like excessive stalking and privacy invasion. Sadly, in 
today’s modern society where we have been spoon-fed and 
corrupted with the help of social media, we can’t help but 
feel that we’re already stalking certain personalities, even if 
we’re not doing so physically.
From the perspective of a parent, this is a cause for 
concern as you would not want your children to become a 
potential victim to yet another rape/molestation case, which 
could eventually lead to a homicide (excuse the bluntness). 
If you’re a parent with a child who is aged from 16 onwards, 
chances are, they probably have an Instagram and Snapchat 
account. To ensure what you can do to keep your child safe, 
Snapchat has introduced a ‘Ghost Mode’ option, which 
allows you to hide yourself on the Snap Map.
As for other social media platforms like Facebook 
and Instagram, it would be wise to not geotag yourself in 
locations until you’re about to leave instead of geotagging 
the moment you reach. This creates the illusion that you’re 
still there when in fact, you’re not.
Although this probably wouldn’t help much in improving 
how geotagging in general works, at least it is one step 
towards creating a safer environment for Malaysians. The 
last thing we need is a front-page headline of a serial rapist/
murderer on the loose in Kuala Lumpur; we already have 
plenty of psychopaths running loose in the streets and some 
may even be next to you.

Celebrating 60 
Years of Innovation
 Looking back at the growth and development of tech companies in Malaysia
I
t’s that time of year again where you dust 
off your old Jalur Gemilang, to hang it 
proudly on your roof or stuck to your car. 
Merdeka isn’t just a time of celebration; 
it’s also a time of reflection. For the tech 
industry, the past 60 years has seen much 
innovation and advancement whether in a 
technical or infrastructure standpoint. To 
celebrate the 60 years of independence, 
we look back at the progress of technology 
in the country, and the companies that 
made it possible. 
Over the past six decades, Malaysia 
enjoyed recognition for being a progressive 
country, in part due to its quick adoption 
to the latest technology. Malaysia is one 
of the most connected nation; most of the 
population owning at least one mobile 
device, with data coverage in nearly every 
part of the country. 
Strategically situated, Malaysia has 
been a popular choice for tech companies 
to expand their footprint in the South 
East Asian region. From international 
conglomerates such as Dell, Acer, Microsoft, 
as well as home grown giants such as TM, 
Maxis, Cyberview; we see these companies 
growing from strength to strength. 
Through aggressive efforts by agencies 
such as MDEC, MCMC, MaGIC and Cradle, 
the government has been ardent in nudging 
the nation to embrace the digital industrial 
age. Initiatives such as Transformasi 
Nasional 2050 scheme is technology driven; 
working closely with tech big names as 
well as entrepreneurs and startups, the 
government is set to shape the digital 
landscape and transformation of Malaysia. 
Especially with the recent surge in 
entrepreneurial efforts by the private sector, 
the country has seen multitudes of potential 
– not just in terms of business operations, 
but also in terms of talents and investments. 
The continued support from the government 
to push forward with new innovations and 
developing young minds, has brought much 
progress for welcoming a digital age. 
For this Merdeka, we want to look at 
some companies that have contributed to 
this transformation. We will be focusing 
on Lenovo bringing back the Moto brand, 
reviving an old sleepy name. Amaryllo 
might be a newcomer to the Malaysian 
market, but has been garnering a steady 
fanbase thanks to its innovative approach 
and attention to details. 
Not forgetting homegrown Shopee, 
combining the best of technology to provide 
convenience for shopping services; as well 
as OnePlus, who was once an underdog, 
turned a renowned and respectable brand. 
Through discovering the brand story of 
these companies, we hope to pay tribute to 
the many companies that decided to set foot 
and grow their business, contributing to the 
transformation of Malaysia.

Always on guarantee ensures no compromise for your security.
T
here is no short of home security 
products in the market. Gone are 
the days when setting up security 
cameras required a specialist to lay the 
wirings and set up a proprietary program 
for viewing. Now, most IP cameras require 
only a simple set-up.  
While only introduced to the Malaysian 
market in October 2016, Amaryllo is entering 
to a highly saturated market. With big names 
like D-Link and Netgear dominating the 
scene, it is difficult for a relatively unknown 
brand to plant a solid footing. Despite this, 
Amaryllo has been gaining a loyal following, 
partly due to its unique product offering.
Unlike other available brands in the 
market, Amaryllo doesn’t limit functionality 
on their line-up. New features added 
to the newer product line aren’t limited 
to the latest versions; like smartphone 
updates, older versions get free automatic 
updates over-the-air, ensuring that both 
existing and new users have access to all 
the latest features. 
Amaryllo also puts a lot of thought 
into its designs. For customers requiring 
a portable and inconspicuous device, 
the Koova easily fits the bill. Winning 
the 2017 CES Innovation Award, it is 
hailed to be one of the smallest auto 
tracking IP cameras in the market. It is 
built for portability and blends in with 
the surroundings, with a simple setup for 
plug-and-play use. 
Despite its small size, it comes 
with the same features expected of 
its larger siblings; the only difference, 
it’s designed for indoor use. With only 
one USB port for power, the device 
is secured with a 256-bit encryption 
and 8GB of built-in storage. Koova is 
designed down to the details, ensuring 
that there are no accidental exploits 
that could lead to a security breach. 
Besides the thoroughly detailed 
design, Amaryllo puts a lot of attention 
to its software and services. Promising 
99% server up time, the company 
guarantees to always have your back. 
The Koova, like the rest of the line-
up, comes with facial recognition 
capabilities. Amaryllo will be rolling 
out further capabilities for the system 
to recognise humans, vehicles and 
pets as well, instead of detecting only 
generic motion. 
Aside from making sure its servers 
will always allow users to access their 
stream, Koova also comes bundled with 
backup services, allowing users to have 
unlimited storage for backing up the 
video streams onto their own Google 
Drive or Network Attached Storage 
(NAS). The device can hold up to four 
SSIDs, automatically switching into the 
strongest signal based on user location. 
With all these features, Amaryllo is 
slowly climbing the ladder to be one of 
the leaders in this avenue. Although 
new 
to 
Malaysia, 
Amaryllo 
has 
certainly proven to be different through 
its exceptional attention to details.

Never Settle for Less
OnePlus builds solid foothold in Malaysia since 2014
F
rom 
a 
small-time 
China-based 
brand to a global mobile technology 
company that challenges conventional 
concepts, OnePlus has grown by leaps 
and bounds in both branding and product 
offerings. Created around the “Never 
Settle” mantra, OnePlus offers the 
smartphone market beautifully designed 
devices with premium build quality and 
high-performance hardware.
While it is a relatively new brand 
compared to the industry big boys; 
OnePlus has garnered a large fanbase in 
Malaysia since the introduction of its first 
smartphone back in 2014.
The OnePlus One, touted as the 
“2014 Flagship Killer”, has changed the 
way consumers view high-performance 
smartphones. At the time, many models 
in the market boasting top-of- the-line 
hardware costed an arm and a leg.
The brand disrupted the market with the 
introduction of the One. Its specifications 
were comparable to other flagship 
smartphones; some may say that it was 
even better than most. With a starting price 
of RM1,000, the One flew off the shelves, 
and the rest was history.
Staying true to its mantra, OnePlus has 
continuously released devices that whet 
the appetite of Malaysian smartphone 
consumers. This year is no different.
Through a strong partnership with one of 
Malaysia’s biggest technology distributors, 
Brightstar Distribution Sdn Bhd, OnePlus 
unveils its OnePlus 5 – the latest in its line-
up of premium flagship smartphones.
Further demonstrating its mission of 
sharing the best technology with the 
world, the OnePlus 5 features the highest 
resolution dual-camera system. Fitted with 
a 16-megapixel and 20-megapixel sensor, 
the duo comes with a telephoto lens to 
accurately determine the distance between 
the sensor and objects in the environment. 
Its large f/1.7 aperture allows for faster 
snaps and helps compensate for stuttering 
to improve image stabilisation.
At 7.25 mm thick, the OnePlus 5 is the 
thinnest flagship from the brand thus far. 
It comes equipped with the Qualcomm 
Snapdragon 835 processor, coupled with 
up to 8 GB of RAM and up to 128GB of 
storage. This combination allows for the 
model to provide powerful performance 
while drawing up to 40% less power.
The impressive hardware is paired 
with its proprietary Dash Charge – 
OnePlus’ 
industry-leading 
charging 
technology. First introduced with the 
OnePlus 3, Dash Charge is the fastest 
charging solution in the global market. 
A quick half-hour charge gives the 
OnePlus 5 enough power for the day.
There are two variants available: 
Midnight Black (8GB RAM / 128GB 
storage) and Slate Gray (6GB RAM / 
64GB storage). The smartphones retail 
(inclusive of 6% GST) for RM2,688 and

Lucas Tan,

Malaysians are demanding for a more technology-based 
lifestyle, no matter young or old. I foresee that government 
and private sectors will establish more IT based facilities.
Derek Shen
The Malaysian competitive gaming scene is becoming 
more established, and this is inspiring. From just watching 
at the sidelines, we now have many local teams that are 
doing well internationally. 
Mina Subri 
We are a generation of sharers – we share so much 
on social media! It’s much easier to keep in touch with 
people and share your life moments, without having to 
call everyone individually. 
Sara Heng 
Since the early days of phones, we’re communicating 
more freely with each other. Telco signals have been 
improving and you can be connected to anyone, 
anywhere, anytime. 
Alex Chaudhary 
There’s so much more choices in computer hardware. 
We used to see a lot of cool technology overseas that 
we don’t get. Now we can readily pick and choose 
what we need, available in Malaysia. 
Naseem Ahmad
Businesses are going online. I see a lot more 
transactions happening online, through e-commerce 
websites, or through social media groups. It’s now 
easier to shop for things, even rare collectibles. 
Andy Pereira
IT and gadgets used to be a very specialised field, but now 
most people’s lives are integrated with IT. Not just in terms 
of smartphones. There are also more hobbyists, whether 
fixing up their own PC, setting up blogs or websites, digital 
photography or even creating apps with coding.

We look back at a decade of iPhone evolution
Phone celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. We look back at some notable 
versions, and how it has changed the mobile market. 
The very first iPhone was a far cry from today’s standards. It didn’t support 
3G, and App Store wasn’t a thing yet. At that time, Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry 
were still the kings of mobile phones. The iPhone was the second device with capacitive 
touch screen (first being the LG Prada). 
The first iPhone to support 3G, allowing for quick browsing on mobile web. The 
advent of AppStore meant the iPhone isn’t just a device with some preloaded fancy 
functions – it opens all sorts of avenues for developers. 
While iPhone 4’s most notable point is perhaps its front facing camera, the 4S saw 
the introduction of Siri, Apple’s much loved personal assistant with the occasional sass. 
It could perform tasks like sending texts, scheduling calendar events and setting alarms. 
iCloud also came around this time, for backup and restore purposes. 
Apple was a bit late into the party, adopting LTE in 2012 while other handsets 
have started offering LTE. The design is slightly taller, supporting widescreen; the 30-
pin connector has been phased out in favour of the Lightning port. The later 5S and 5C 
version also saw the addition of touch fingerprint ID on the home button.
By now, the market is maturing into increased convenience. With the iPhone 6, they’ve 
included near-field communication (NFC) for contactless credit card payment and Apple Pay. 
Throughout the years, the screen has also increased in size.
Arguably a more controversial design, as Apple omitted the headphone jack. A huge 
debate sparked controversy towards whether it’s a smart move to remove the 3.5mm 
standard plug. Another   argument went towards Apple’s marketing by pushing its wireless 
earbuds known as AirPods onto its users.
10th anniversary handset, expected to launch around September. Leaks suggest a near 
bezel-less design, along with a list of rumoured features. 10 years along, would there be 
any controversial designs? Further ground-breaking innovations? Might it turn out to be a 
disappointing release signifying the loss of momentum? We’ll have to see.

It’s been 10 years since Steve Jobs revealed the first iPhone.

honor 8 Pro
A Step Closer to the Future
In terms of benchmark scores alone, the 
honor 8 Pro is a beast for mobile gamers. 
The  Quad HD display makes mobile games 
look stunning without any visual lag or 
stutter. There’s even a pre-installed Jaunt 
VR app for all you VR fanatics. Featuring 
VR games and videos, the honor 8 Pro can 
bring you into the thick of the action or 
even courtside at a basketball game.
Keeping Cool
The honor 8 Pro doesn’t 
heat up under pressure, 
even when used for 
long hours of  gaming 
or video streaming.
A Carbon Copy
While there are dual 
cameras at the back, the 
honor 8 Pro doesn’t have 
any tie-ups with Leica so 
it wouldn’t be carrying 
the signature logo.
Still Somewhat 
Lacking
Sadly, the honor 8 Pro 
only comes in Blue or 
Black, giving you very 
few choices.
The honor is All Mine
Stepping Out of the Shadows
A literal upgrade from the honor 8, the 
honor 8 Pro takes over its younger brother 
in a distinctive fashion. Although it shares 
very similar looks and can be mistaken 
for the honor 8 at first glance, the honor 
8 Pro features a brushed metal look and 
feel similar to the Huawei P10. The honor 
8 Pro also kept its fingerprint scanner at 
the back, making it much easier if you’re 
converting from its predecessor.
First of its Name
Being the latest device to come out of 
Huawei to use its Kirin HiSilicon 960 
processor, you would think the honor 
8 Pro would cost an arm and a leg. 
Surprisingly, the honor 8 Pro can be 
considered in a mid-tier price group. 
Paired with 6GB of RAM and 64GB 
internal storage, switching between 
different apps in rapid succession 
doesn’t even slow it down. This makes 
multitasking a walk in the park.

While it is not a remarkable shooter, the honor 8 Pro does get the job done in making the most boring of shots look good. 
Being able to see the clear differences in fruits based on colour while making a boring plate of pasta look good enough to eat 
(which I did), the honor 8 Pro will do just fine for the ‘gram.
A Mobile Gaming Beast
Thanks to the Quad HD display, the honor 
8 Pro is the perfect representation of a 
smartphone made for gaming and your 
daily binge-watching needs. It captures 
accurate colour representation and 
details fully when gaming while being 
able to accommodate high-quality 
videos without any screen tearing. 
Streaming the latest episode of Game 
of Thrones was amazing (Game of 
Thrones is already amazing; the device 
just made it look even better). 
Staying Alive
The honor 8 Pro is kitted with a 4,000mAh high-density battery capable of lasting for two full days when used conservatively. If you’re 
a heavy user, the phone will last a little bit over a day, give or take a few hours. The honor 8 Pro also has fast charging technology so 
you don’t have to wait long for the phone to juice up.

ASUS Zenfone AR
Augmented Performance
The phone isn’t just an AR gimmick. 
The performance of the device itself is 
quick, with no problems multitasking or 
swapping between applications. Loading 
content is quick, while gaming is a breeze. 
However, the touch sensors are less 
sensitive than we’d like and that might 
cause a slight annoyance to some. 
Leather Back
Unlike many phones with a 
metallic finish, the ZenFone 
AR opted for a faux leather 
finish, making it feel much 
more resistant against wear 
and tear. 
Hey, Google!
The phone is pre-loaded with 
Google Assistant. Fire away with 
your questions and requests!  
One-way Speaker
With only a downward-firing 
speaker, it is easy to accidentally 
cover up the speaker if you were 
holding it in your hand.  
AR magic
There are three cameras here 
– a 23-megapixel camera for 
snapping photos; the other two 
additional cameras are for depth 
sensing and motion detection.  
It Takes a Phone to Tango
Augmented Life
Being one of the first smartphones marketed 
specifically for AR, we were eager to try out 
all the new functions with Google Tango. 
While the accuracy could do with more 
work, overall, it was a pleasant experience 
using the phone to map out the work areas, 
take measurements, explore the interiors of 
a car and more. We can definitely see some 
practical use, as well as entertainment use 
for AR-enabled phones. 
Super Clear Camera
The camera isn’t just powerful, it comes 
with many presets and features, allowing 
you to choose your preferred shooting 
mode easily. Low-light isn’t a problem, 
with the super resolution mode taking 
clear pictures and capturing action shots 
easily. ASUS’s beautify mode also lets 
you take great selfies – I swear I’ve never 
seen myself with such good skin before!

A Better Alien than Some
Illegear Troika
Make Space
Weighing in at 12kg, the Troika is 
certainly heavy and commands a 
large amount of desk space so 
you might want to make some 
room.
Y U No Give Tempered 
Glass?
All three panels of the Troika are 
encased in textured aluminium but 
if you want something a bit flashier, 
there is also a tempered glass 
option.
Invest in Headphones
One of the very few downsides of 
the Troika is its radiator fan for 
the all-in-one cooling system. The 
CPU fan is much more annoying 
compared to the subdued GPU 
fan.
Stranger Things Season 3?
Being Illegear’s first ever gaming 
rig and taking a break from creating 
customisable 
gaming 
laptops, 
the 
Illegear Troika is in a league of its own. 
Featuring a one-of-a-kind shape that 
resembles an alien spaceship, Illegear 
has quite clearly gone to town with its 
design, making it stand out. Even though 
its design doesn’t seem constructive, 
you can slide open its three panels, 
which will reveal what’s beneath the 
hood like its PSU, motherboard and GPU.
Time to Own
Although benchmarks should be taken 
with a pinch of salt, the scores on the 
Troika are still impressive. Topping the 
charts on 3DMark, the Troika can handle 
with the best and still come out on top. 
Throw any graphic-intensive game at it 
and it will most certainly shine. When 
putting it through the AIDA64 Stress Test 
at 100% CPU usage, the results were 
surprising as CPU temperatures ranged 
between 45-47° while the motherboard 
maintained at a cool 41°.
A Worthy Investment?
Almost breaching the five-digit price point, 
the Troika is clearly a top-end gaming 
desktop rig. One could argue that it would 
cost less to customise an entirely new rig 
for a lower price point, and one would be 
right. Of course, there are other factors 
at play such as the time it takes to put 
together an entire rig and having to take 
the time to source all the components 
needed. Overall, it comes down to how 
much you would be willing to pay for the 
price of convenience.

Nokia 5
Smooth Performance
Although the processor in the Nokia 5 is an 
entry-level Snapdragon, you barely feel any 
lag in performance. The operations were 
smooth, which made swapping between 
apps or running a few parallel operations 
no big deal. Gaming and navigation were 
equally responsive without any hint of 
a blip in performance power. Precisely 
because the device uses an entry-level 
Snapdragon, the battery can last for a long 
while. Using up less processing power, the 
3000mAh battery can run comfortably for a 
couple days under heavy use.
Asisstant on your 
fingetips
The phone comes with Google 
Assistant pre-installed, making life 
much more convenient and fun.
Android O-kay
This phone is slated to get 
the Android O update when it 
becomes available.  
SIM and microSD 
Instead of hybrid SIM trays, the Nokia 5 
comes with separate trays for dual SIM as 
well as microSD card. No need to choose 
between a work number or extra storage!
Almost Premium
Beautiful design
Our first reaction to the Nokia 5 was how 
sleek the design was. Holding a 5-inch 
screen, it didn’t feel like a big phone. The 
body was smooth and while it didn’t feel 
heavy, it wasn’t flimsy either. The display 
is crisp with a clean, minimalistic user 
interface. This is one phone that will 
display every tiny detail in full clarity. 
Disappointing camera
One letdown of the phone is the camera. 
The operation was rather slow and 
shooting in low-light was disappointingly 
subpar. Although it works well enough in 
bright conditions, it is a decent camera 
that gives clear pictures. However, use 
it in a darker setting or with quick action 
shots and it fails to impress.

Want to Give a Squeeze?
HTC U11
Squeeze Me Tightly
The biggest feature of the HTC U11 is the 
collection of sensors located on the sides 
of the device. These pressure-sensitive 
sensors can detect how hard you are 
squeezing. Depending on the level of 
pressure applied, you can execute actions 
or run apps that you prefer on the phone. 
By default, a hard squeeze will launch the 
camera and a quick squeeze will snap a 
photo. Pretty nifty.  
High Performance 
Underneath the pretty glass body is the 
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 – the fastest 
SoC currently in the market. It blazes 
through all benchmarks like a hot knife 
through butter and thanks to the 6GB 
RAM, apps will run silky smooth with 
minimal lag. The 5.5-inch 2K display 
shows all your content in high definition, 
right in the palm of your hand.
Two Steps Forward,
One Step Back
The built-in 6GBs of RAM means the apps 
running on the tablet will not be facing 
the dreaded low memory notification, 
while 128GB of on-board storage means 
the tablet can handle as much data 
as you have; it can even be expanded 
through the microSD slot. 
Great Imaging 
Experience
The camera on the 
HTC U11 is one of the 
best we have seen on 
a smartphone thus far, 
befitting their podium 
win at DxOMark.

Camera Wonderphone
Wiko UPulse
Sub-par Performance
After testing Harry for our previous issue, 
we certainly felt the lag in the UPulse. 
Harry was much more responsive while 
the UPulse pales in comparison. It isn’t 
a catastrophic lag – most applications 
hold up quite decently, and day-to-
day functions won’t be a problem. Run 
a few more applications for multi-
tasking though, the phone slows down 
significantly. Maybe we’ve been spoilt by 
Wiko Harry’s speedy performance.   
Low-light Wonder 
Despite 
its 
slightly 
disappointing 
performance, the camera isn’t shabby 
at all. It comes with a night mode that 
the phone will suggest in low-lighting 
situations. The night mode holds up 
surprisingly well, bringing out some colours 
and details despite situations being close 
to pitch black. Although parking just a 
13-megapixel lens, the Super Pixel pairs 
with a 5-piece lens system to give up to 
52-megapixel shots. 
Power to Entertainment
What it lacks in performance, it makes up 
with not only the smart camera, but also 
a larger, clearer screen compared to its 
peers. The 3,000mAh battery gives plenty 
of playtime for watching movies, playing 
games, or snapping photos. The phone is 
a joy to play general games with, bringing 
vivid colours and details to the screen.  
Removable Back
As with many of its 
siblings, 
Wiko 
phones 
have removable backs. 
Unlike its other siblings, 
the UPulse’s battery is non-
removable though. 
More than a 
Fingerprint
The fingerprint sensor is 
more than just a security 
feature. It doubles up for 
other functions, such as a 
shutter button. 
Muffled Sound
The speaker output is via 
the back-bottom section, so 
if your phone was flat on a 
surface the sound will turn 
out heavily muffled.

The Jabra Evolve 75 will detect any 
available Bluetooth device so it’s just 
connect-and-go. For PCs, the USB dongle 
comes pre-paired, so you can plug the 
connector to the USB and you are ready 
to rock out. If you run into any issues with 
the device detecting the dongle, you can 
manually pair your headphones with the 
JabraDirect software on your PC easily. 
Freedom to Move
Not restricted by wires, you are free to 
move about without getting yourself 
tangled. When we tested this, there 
were no problems moving from one room 
to another; the music was still playing 
clearly without disruption. While the 
audio quality isn’t top-notch, the Evolve 
75 gets the job done, especially for those 
who enjoy music while working.  
Sorry, Can You Repeat That 
Please? 
The active noise-cancelling function of 
the device works like a charm. This works 
well in a noisy office environment as you 
won’t hear much when it’s turned on. The 
headphones feature handy buttons on 
each side, making it easy to switch on/
off the noise-cancelling feature, volume 
controls and an ‘added bass’ for those 
looking to head bang.
Stick it to the Side
The side of the head band has a small 
magnet where you can attach the mic 
when it’s not in use.
Charging
A single full charge gives you 14 hours 
of battery life, comfortably lasting you 
through a working day. It comes with 
a charging dock that plugs into USB

Ryzen’s Best Friend
Using the new X370 chipset from AMD, 
the Gigabyte Auros AX370-Gaming 5 sits 
on the higher-end of the price and feature 
bracket for Ryzen. What is great about this 
chipset is the support for modern features 
such as DDR4, PCI-Express 3.0, M.2 slots 
and even the new AM4 socket for the 
processor. It can even support two-way 
SLI and Crossfire for graphics cards. 
Complete in Features
This motherboard will leave you wanting 
more; it has just about everything you need 
to complete your computer. The Input/
Output (I/O) ports on the motherboard 
includes 10 USB ports (with one being 
the new USB Type-C 3.1 variant), a single 
HDMI port for future AMD APU processors, 
a Gigabit LAN port from Intel and Killer as 
well as up to 8 SATA 6Gbps connectors for 
fast storage connectivity. To make it even 
faster, the M.2 slots can accept SSDs right 
on the motherboard.
Exquisite Performance
When paired with the top-of-the-line 
Ryzen CPU, the motherboard will sing to 
your heart’s content. You can expect good 
performance with just about any software 
you can throw at it. As expected with 
modern-day motherboards, the AX370-
Gaming 5 also receives a healthy dose of 
built-in RGB LEDs that can be controlled 
using the software. To top it off, even when 
overclocked, the motherboard remains 
stable and consistent.

Not only is the B250 affordable, it is 
jam-packed with features and important

peripherals. One of its important features 
would be the six on-board USB ports (a 
mixture of both USB Type-A and Type-C

top-quality audio connection.
Intel 7th Gen. Processor 
Support
The LGA 1151 socket accepts both the 6th

it backward and forward compatible. Aside 
from being widely acceptable to Intel users, 
the B250 can support up to four sticks of RAM

being able to support Intel Optane memory 
to boost local storage transfer speed, the 
B250 comes with m.2 slots for SSD usage.

MSI GeForce GTX 1080Ti Gaming X Twin Forza VI
Triple-slot Design
You need to set aside some space 
on your motherboard as this is a 
triple-slot design, making it much 
thicker than usual.
Super Cooling Power
Known for its dual cooling fan design, MSI is 
arguably one of the better cooling solutions 
in the market. This makes the MSI GeForce 
GTX 1080Ti Gaming X Twin Forza VI – what 
a mouthful – the perfect GPU to have in your 
gaming build. The fans keep the GPU cool 
with idle temperatures hovering around 38°C 
with 70°C being the maximum temperature 
it will hit; quite cool for a GPU.
Titan-X Lite?
Lying at the core of the Gaming X Twin 
Forza VI is the Pascal-based GP102-350 
core built with the 16nm Finfet fabrication 
process. The core is the same as the 
Titan-X, albeit with small differences. The 
Gaming X Twin Forza VI is 5% faster in 
terms of base clock speed but comes with 
less RAM and smaller memory bus. In the 
end, the performance gap between the 
Gaming X Twin Forza VI and Titan-X are 
close enough, which begs the question: 
would you pay more for an older GPU?
Performance Like No Other
It’s a great time for gamers to be alive. 
Being one of the greatest GPUs right 
now, the Gaming X Twin Forza VI acts as 
a turbo charger for your build. Games like 
‘Rise of the Tomb Raider’, ‘DOOM’ and 
‘The Witcher III’ ran with high framerates, 
some even reaching above 100 fps 
(frames per second). This bodes well for 
those who are always on the cutting edge 
in gaming as this card gives you the best 
performance – at least for right now.

At 65W TDP, you do not

Pretty Cooler
The Ryzen 5 1400 
comes with the AMD 
Wraith Stealth cooler, 
which is good enough 
for casual users. 
Budget Gamer 
Friendly
Entry-level Processing
At its price point, the Ryzen 5 1400 will 
give you the best bang for your buck. 
Why? It has the same number of cores 
and threads as a mid-range processor 
from Intel with a price tag of less than 
one-third. You also get all the trimmings 
of the Ryzen life, including DDR4 support, 
native USB 3.0 and 3.1, as well as NVME 
storage support. 
Unlocked Performance – Yay!
The entire Ryzen line-up from AMD 
comes out of the box unlocked, making 
overclocking easy for anyone when 
needed. Plus, seeing that the 1400 starts 
from 3.4GHz, you have more headroom to 
overclock the CPU. However, you will need 
a good third-party CPU cooler to ensure it 
doesn’t burn out.
Good for Budget Gaming 
Enthusiasts
When paired with the appropriate 
motherboard, the 1400 will sing like a 
canary (much like how your wallet and

QWERTY Warrior
Blackberry KEYOne
That QWERTY
The crowning feature of the Blackberry 
KEYOne is its keyboard. In-fact, it is the 
only modern smartphone today with a 
physical QWERTY keyboard. The KEYOne 
came with tactile feedback, making 
typing very satisfying, especially with 
the keys Blackberry elected to use. Plus, 
the keyboard is touch sensitive; you can 
just swipe on the keyboard instead of the 
screen to navigate through the device.
Long Battery Life
For Blackberry’s latest flagship, the KEYOne 
comes with a Snapdragon 625 processor, 
which can’t be considered a blazing 
performance machine. However, this 
chipset sips power. With a single charge, 
users can expect over 24 hours of usability. 
In fact, we managed to get upwards of 30 
hours during testing – moderate-to-high 
usage – and when using WiFi, a week on a 
single charge is the norm.
Productivity Catalyst
Thanks to the KEYOne, we had no reason to 
not be productive. What’s not to like about 
having a keyboard that you can type, no 
matter where you are. Additionally, each key 
can be assigned to be a shortcut to anything 
you need – an app, a person you call often or 
an action on the device. For example, long-
press the F key to launch Facebook, S for 
Search or M for Mom; this is one of the more 
helpful features in the KEYOne. 
High Security
Not only is the phone 
protected 
by 
Blackberry 
DTEK, the KEYOne features 
a cleverly hidden fingerprint 
scanner on the spacebar 
button; it’s insanely fast too!
Single SIM World
Blackberry did not see the

so the phone can only accept 
a single nano SIM card; it 
supports 4G LTE though.

What makes the Casio EXILIM EX-FR100 
such a versatile shooter is its ability to 
shoot in a variety of ways. While it keeps to 
the conventional camera and selfie style of 
shooting, the camera can also be detached 
from the controller, which doubles as an LCD

different cameras for different purposes as 
the EX-FR100 can do all the above.
Built Like a Rock
The camera on the EX-FR100 comes 
with a dirt-resistant coating as well as 
an elastic floating structure to protect 
itself against shocks and falls. Even 
the body is just as durable as its made 
from lightweight, fibre-reinforced nylon 
material at the hinge while the rest of 
the body is made of stainless steel. To 
provide extra grip on your more arduous 
adventures, there’s also non-slip tactile 
coating to give you that extra support.
Time to Techsessorise
One unique feature of the EX-FR100 is its 
ability to accessorise with a wide variety 
of accessories and add-ons. From tripod 
mounts to multi-angle belts and clips, and 
even an LED ring light, this is one camera 
worth having with all the accessories. 
Both the camera and the controller are

you’re worried about the battery dying on

The Return of a Classic
Nokia 3310
In The Wrong Era
What makes the 3310 stand out is its pure 
throwback to a classic mobile phone in the 
age of smartphones. Of course, it is packed 
with new features that the older version 
didn’t have. For starters, the new and 
improved 3310 comes with a 2-megapixel 
camera (which isn’t too shabby), a colour 
screen, USB charging and a microSD slot. 
Yes, you can play back video and music on 
the 3310, but not all file formats.
All Plastic, Still Robust
Two different materials are available with 
the 3310 – a matte plastic, akin to the 
original rough textured plastic; and a glossy, 
shiny plastic. The latter can be very slippery 
when used, but both materials are robust 
enough that it can withstand some rough-
housing. The case may break apart, but it 
is due to design rather than how fragile the 
phone is. It is no brickhouse, but you can 
rough it out with this phone. 
Simple Communications
When it’s all said and done, the 3310 is the 
modern-day burner phone with the ability 
to capture 2-megapixels pictures and play 
music. Internet surfing? What’s that?
Pretty Fly
Although it doesn’t share the same 
‘ground-breaking’ qualities as its previous 
generation, the 3310 is still decent to look 
at and is tough in its own right.

Sony Xperia XZ Premium
A Premium Price
Winner of the ‘Best New Smartphone’ 
award during MWC 2017, the Xperia XZ 
Premium has lived up to its hype so far 
prior to its release in the Malaysian market. 
Easily one of the more premium-priced 
smartphones, the XZ Premium is no slouch 
when it comes to performing under pressure 
(although the same can’t be said for other 
devices). While you may feel the pinch for 
a couple of months, the XZ Premium is a 
worthy smartphone investment.
Stacked and Jacked
Everything about the XZ Premium just 
screams top-notch. From being able to 
display 4K HDR content to having the 
IP65/68 waterproof rating and even blowing 
multitasking capabilities out of the water 
with the help of the Snapdragon 835, the XZ 
Premium is the smartphone you will want to 
have. The all-new Stamina mode will adapt 
itself to your daily usage and ensure you get 
the most out of the smartphone. 
Slowing it Down
One of the most important features of the 
XZ Premium is its 19-megapixel Motion 
Eye camera paired with Super Slow-Mo 
and Predictive Capture, taking the concept 
of smartphone photography to a whole 
new level. Although slow-mo videos and 
predictive capture images do take some 
getting used to, you’re aided with the Exmor 
RS image sensor alongside Sony G Lens. 
Pictures contain less noise with better clarity 
and colour reproduction, making them look 
much better than most smartphones.
Quick and Easy
The USB 3.1 Type-C connection promises 
blazing fast transfer speeds while you 
forget about how annoying it was to 
plug the cable the wrong-side in.
Lack of Choices
Sadly, the Xperia XZ Premium 
only comes in three colours: 
Luminous Chrome, Bronze 
Pink and Deepsea Black. 
However, these three colours 
are a sight to behold as you 
won’t get bored of them.
Bluetooth v5.0!
Another 
great 
feature

E-Blue Cobra Weapon EKM820 3-in-1
Keeping it Affordable
One of the greatest things you can ask from 
E-Blue is the affordability of its products. 
For only RM149, you get a gaming keyboard 
paired with a gaming mouse and even 
a mousepad. If you’re tight on a budget 
but still find yourself needing a gaming 
keyboard and mouse combo, the EKM820 
is a great starter kit until you decide to take 
things up a notch.
What a Snake
The mouse is named Cobra and while it 
doesn’t resemble anything like a snake, 
it sure moves like one. It has a slender 
ergonomic shape, much like the Razer 
Diamondback. This is great for gamers 
who has a claw grip on the mouse. There 
is also a soft matte finish to the mouse 
but after some months of usage, it might 
start to peel off.

Membrane or Mechanical?
The keyboard of the EKM820 uses 
membrane keys rather than mechanical

mechanical keys so if you’re looking for 
something out of the conventional, you 
might want to give this a look. It’s also 
surprisingly quick and clicky thanks to 
its plunger-like switches, giving a great 
balance. It makes typing great while 
gaming is also well above average.
Great Macro Functions 
The Cobra comes with six buttons on its body so 
you can assign each button to a specific item or 
skill when gaming.

make sure it doesn’t slip.

 Cooler Master MasterKeys L
Speed is of the Essence
In most cases, gaming keyboards from 
Cooler Master would always carry either 
the Blue, Red or Brown Cherry MX switches. 
As far as we know, Ducky is the only other 
gaming keyboard manufacturer that supplies 
its keyboards with Cherry MX Speed Silver 
switches. The MasterKeys L sure lives up to 
its name as the travel time for each key is 
extremely quick with an actuation point of 
only 1.2mm, making gaming and typing a joy.
Long-lasting Keycaps
While there are plenty of gaming 
keyboards that are using the standard 
ABT keycaps, the MasterKeys L is using 
the highly sturdy PBT keycaps. This 
gived it a tougher and sturdier feel when 
typing as PBT caps are thicker and highly 
sustainable by nature. This also gives 
your typing an audible click while keeping 
the crisp tactile experience intact.

Unlike every other gaming keyboard, the

shouldn’t be mixed up with the MasterKeys 
Pro series; back to the matter at hand. It’s a 
breath of fresh air to have a gaming keyboard 
without any glaring LEDs although it does 
make me somewhat miss the customisation 
process. Goodbye raindrop and ripple, you 
will be sorely missed.
Typing for Years to Come 
Thanks to the use of the Cherry MX switches, 
the MasterKeys L has a lifespan of at least 50 
million keystrokes, giving you a keyboard that 
can last for years.
Easy Setup
With the USB 2.0 cable, you 
can now connect the cable 
to the keyboard as the micro-
USB port is located on the 
right side of the keyboard.

“Bonus tip: Give 
clear direction to 
your subject on 
positioning, and 
allow him to review 
the images taken, 
to see how best to 
correct his posture 
to achieve the best 
composition.”
No one wants to look like a penguin, so for bespoke 
suit-makers like Mr. G, the key is in the fit and wearability.
Tip: Give your subject the sharp, confident look he 
deserves by shooting at a lower angle to change up the 
perspective. This makes him look taller and works to indicate 
a sense of power. With the tilting screen of the EOS M5, we 
framed the first shot with ease.
Each project is different; each piece is unique to the 
wearer’s style and needs. Mr G. makes it a point to learn 
about the personality of each client as well as understand the 
occasion they will need the suit for before designing the piece.
Tip: Whether it’s suit-making or photography, we can 
always learn from our subjects. Communicate with your subject 
to understand what is special about them or the topic of the 
shoot, which will in turn inspire you on the must-have shots.

When it comes to making suits, a small change can make 
a huge difference, and it’s better to tapper in slowly to fine-tune 
the final output.
Tip: A pro tip to making sure you get the rule-of-thirds 
right, is to shoot wide and crop later. In addition, the presence 
of other props framing your subject not only adds to the context 
but also isolates him from a messy background.

Manual (f/3.5, 1/800sec.)/ ISO 200/ WB: Auto
The immaculate intricacies in each suit’s design are 
testament to the craftsman’s dedication. Much like the art of 
photography, it requires skill as much as practice while the art 
of tailoring can only be qualified with the details.
Tip: Here we used a dedicated macro lens, the EF-M 
28mm f/3.5 Macro IS STM to capture the fine details and 
enhancing texture. The in-built ring-light of this lens can also 
be used to balance the light and shadows that become evident 
when shooting up-close. When shooting in macro, minute 
changes in aperture make a huge difference in the appearance 
of depth, so stop up a little and choose a faster shutter speed to 
prevent motion blur, resulting in micro movements.
Mr. G brings the concept of mobility back to suit-making by 
bringing their expertise to the doorsteps of their clients, giving 
advice on matching the right angles on the spot.
Tip: Playing with light and exposure builds an entirely 
different mood. Try out backlighting or challenge yourself to 
shoot during the Golden Hours. The light during the Golden 
Hour presents itself as a soft golden glow that casts contrasting 
shadows or a dreamy glow on subjects.
Why should you turn to custom suit-making instead of 
getting one off the rack? It’s because we are all unique individuals 
– with distinctive contours and different lifestyle needs. It’s 
the same for photography with the finest interchangeable-lens 
mirrorless camera yet – the EOS M5. Tailor it to suit your lifestyle, 
to capture moments exactly the way you experience them, to 
celebrate inspiration with the art of photography.

hile full-sized desktop PCs have 
been a common thing for many 
years now, mini PCs have steadily 
been on the rise due to its 
miniscule design, thus eliminating the need 
to dedicate a certain amount of space on your 
table for it. Although much smaller compared 
to desktop PCs, the mini PCs can meet the 
ever-demanding standards of consumers in 
terms of performance and power.
For this month’s showdown, we’ve 
brought together four mini PCs from JOI, Acer, 
Lenovo and ASUS to see how each of them 
fare against one another and to decide on 
which mini PC will reign supreme.

ometimes, all you need is a simple machine that 
you can plug stuff into and it works. Take the ASUS 
VivoMini UN65U, for example. This compact machine 
brings a perfect balance between performance, 
looks and usability. 
From the outside, the VivoMini looks elegant. The 
polycarbonate body is compact enough that you can 
slip it underneath a monitor, or mount it at the back of 
said monitor. Design-wise alone, the VivoMini is small 
enough to not look out of place, yet powerful enough to 
get what needs to be done.
Inside lies an Intel Core i5 7200U processor. 
This processor, while an ultra-low voltage variant, is 
powerful enough to run just about anything you can 
throw at it. It even can handle video editing without too 
much of a problem. Paired with 8GB of RAM, 128GB of 
internal storage and a smorgasbord of related inputs, 
you have yourself a well-equipped device capable of 
getting almost anything done. 
ASUS threw in a few ports on the VivoMini as well. This 
includes four USB ports (two on the front, two at the rear), a 
HDMI port, a LAN port, and even an SD Card reader. All that is 
needed is a monitor and a keyboard/mouse setup and you have 
a mini productivity machine no bigger than a six-pack of soda. 
Now, when we say productivity, the VivoMini can handle 
some medium-grade work, but nothing more than a simple 
video rendering job. It can play games too – but do not expect 
60fps shoot fests with this. You will be lucky to get 30fps on 
medium, thanks to the integrated GPU. However, thanks to the 
8GB of RAM, you can open as many Chrome tabs as you want, 
and it will not bog down your system. That is very important 
as the web is our lifeline to the world today.

Flexibility to Customise
t 4-inches by 4-inches, the JOI isn’t just compact, 
it looks and feels sturdy. Coming with a mount 
right out the box, this is another mini PC that can 
be mounted under your desk, behind your monitor, 
or almost anywhere. However small it may be, it certainly 
can pack a punch.
Unlike a lot of mini PCs that come with a predetermined 
set of specifications, the JOI box allows users to customise 
some parts of the PC to suit their needs. With two SODIMM 
sockets for expandable memory up to 16GB and Dual 
PCIe mini card connectors to support wireless and SSD 
configurations, this mini PC allows users to choose the 
options that best suit their requirements.   
Besides customisability, the JOI comes with more than 
enough ports to expand its use. This mini PC comes with 
one SATA port for connection to 2.5” HDD or SSD, one Mini 
DisplayPort, one Mini HDMI Port, one Gigabit LAN, headphone/
microphone jack and a total of four USB 3.0 ports. This means 
you can hook up your monitor, mouse, keyboard, headphones 
and an external hard disk with extras to spare. 
Powered by an Intel Core i5 4250U processor, it provides 
more than enough power and performance for work and 
entertainment. While it’s not quite for gaming, it certainly 
holds up to vigorous use of image editing, watching movies 
and light gaming. Having more than a few browser tabs 
open is no problem at all, giving smooth transition between 
applications and webpages.
The boot-up time for the JOI box is quick so you waste 
almost no time getting your systems up and running. However, for 
anything that requires heavy graphics usage or a lot of processor 
power, the JOI tends to either seize up or some applications won’t 
behave as intended. While it’s no heavyweight, the specs of the 
machine allows it to render videos quickly, run a fast-moving FPS 
game and even hold its own to heavy daily usage.

aving been in the scene for over 40 years, Acer has 
always been one of the more common household 
names when it comes to consumer IT devices. From 
its Swift series laptops to the Predator series gaming 
laptops, Acer knows what the consumers want. As for the Revo 
Base, this mini PC was made for keeping you entertained for all 
hours of the night.
With rounded edges and a small footprint, the Revo Base 
will take up very little space on your desk. If you want it to blend 
into your table top, it also comes with a VESA mount, which can 
be hung onto the back of your monitor. This gives you a more 
minimalistic outlook as well as a cleaner table.
Design-wise, the Revo Base is self-explanatory with 
two USB 3.0 ports at the front, alongside the power button. 
Located on the left side of the body is an SD card reader while 
more ports lay at the back, mainly two more USB 3.0 ports, 
one DisplayPort, one HDMI Output and a Network (RJ-45) port. 
Aside from its exterior, the Revo Base also houses an Intel Core 
i3-5005U processor with 4GB RAM (which can be upgraded to 
16GB) and a 500GB hard drive.
Sadly, the 4GB standard model is subpar at best. Although 
it does itself justice when you’re running multiple programs at 
once, it starts to get bogged down the moment there are one 
too many Google Chrome tabs open. However, if you’re looking 
for an all-in-one entertainment system, that’s where the Revo 
Base lives as it can be expanded in terms of RAM and internal 
storage to store all your movies and TV shows, if needed.
Another interesting feature is the omission of Ethernet 
cables as the Revo Base is completely wireless while promising 
quicker Wi-Fi download speeds with 802.11ac. Although video 
streaming through Twitch and Netflix were swift, download 
speeds were pretty much standard.

mong the four, the Lenovo ThinkCentre M710q is 
by far the most dated in design –  it looks like 
a literal black box that had just emerged from 
storage. Upon booting up, we discovered that 
it comes pre-loaded with a Windows 7 Professional 
operating system, which further adds to the illusion of 
this device being from the early 2000’s.  
 
Like most mini PCs in the market, the ThinkCentre 
M710q is light, weighing at approximately 1.3kg. Comparative 
to the other devices in this Showdown, the ThinkCentre 
M710q has the largest footprint despite being the thinnest. 
However, the saying “never judge a book by its cover” 
holds true for this powerhouse. The ThinkCentre M710q is not 
a lightweight when it comes to performance. Though tiny, its 
capabilities as a mini PC are astounding. 
Thanks to its Quad Core Intel Core i7-6700T 
processor, the ThinkCentre M710q can multitask, taking 
itself beyond just word processing and web browsing. The 
processor is paired with 8GB DDR4 2400Mhz RAM and a 
generous 1TB 5400 RPM SATA storage. 
While testing it out, we really maximised its resources with 
Adobe Creative Cloud. From Photoshop to Premier, we put its 
hardware to the test and found that this mini PC can hold its own. 
In terms of ports, the ThinkCentre M710q is very generous 
with its USB connectivity. Users can choose from six – yes, you 
read that right – USB ports: two in front, and the rest at the back. 
However, what is missing from this device is a HDMI 
port. You have two DisplayPorts, but really, most modern-day 
monitors come with a HDMI output. We had to dig deep in our 
treasure trove of wires to find an adaptor.

CONCLUSION
After testing out all four mini PCs and seeing the diversity of each device, we have decided to crown the winner of this month’s 
showdown to the Lenovo ThinkCentre M710q! It’s exceptional performance from multitasking between various programs to 
even being able to handle work from the Adobe Creative Cloud gave it a decisive edge against the others. However, this doesn’t 
mean the other devices in the line-up are bad; each has its merits and the M710q only just came out ahead.

ASEAN 
countries are planning to 
invest in mobile application 
projects in the next 24 months. 
According 
to 
an 
IDC 
survey 
commissioned by Red Hat, IT professionals 
from Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia 
are keen to adopt enterprise mobility. 
However, many still struggle to put in 
place a workable strategy, due to a lack 
of talents in mobile-specific skills within 
these three countries. 
The “Maturing Mobile Journey for 
Enterprises – ASEAN Perspectives” survey 
includes responses from 275 IT professionals 
across Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. 
The survey showed 56% of the 
respondents recognising the strategic 
importance of mobility to their business, 
while 40% plan to focus on mobile 
application-related projects in the next 
12 to 24 months.
However, 
60% 
of 
Malaysian 
respondents 
noted 
that 
their 
organisation have minimal or contracted 
skills to support mobile projects. The 
lack of talent has been one of the 
largest setbacks to further adoption for 
enterprise mobility.

Gartner says Malaysia IT spending expected to grow in 2017
Growing Tech 
Expenditure
alaysians are spending more 
on 
technology 
products 
and services, with Gartner 
expecting a 7.1% growth 
this year compared to 2016. 
According to Gartner, Malaysians 
are forecasted to spend RM61.9 million in 
2017, while global spending is projected 
to total US$3.5 trillion. 
“Digital business is having a 
profound effect on the way business 
is done and how it is supported,” said 
John-David Lovelock, vice president and 
distinguished analyst at Gartner. “The 
impact of digital business is giving rise to 
new categories. These next-generation 
offerings are fueled by business and 
technology platforms that will be the 
driver for new categories of spending.”
The 
Gartner 
Worldwide 
IT 
Spending Forecast is the leading 
indicator of major technology trends 
across the hardware, software, IT 
services and telecom markets. 
Worldwide spending on devices 
(PCs, tablets, ultramobiles and mobile 
phones) is projected to grow 3.8% in 
2017, to reach $654 billion. This is an 
increase from the previous quarter’s 
forecast of 1.7%.
The report also predicts that mobile 
phone growth will be driven by increased 
average selling prices (ASPs) for premium 
phones in mature markets due to the 10th 
anniversary of the iPhone. Meanwhile, the 
tablet market continues to be in decline.

C.com: So, what are your 
aspirations for Samsung as 
a globally recognised brand 
in Malaysia?
Elaine Soh: Our vision and aspiration for 
our brand is to inspire Malaysians and to 
create the future by transforming ideas 
and technology into innovations and 
designs that enrich lives and contribute 
to social prosperity in Malaysia. We hope 
for our Malaysian consumers to gain new 
experiences and discover new possibilities 
through our products.
PC.com: In other parts like Korea 
and Europe, the brand is almost 
everywhere, but not so much here 
despite being established since 2003. 
What’s your opinion on this?
Soh: I believe that the brand is very 
prevalent in the country and speaks to all 
levels of societies in Malaysia. This has 
been proven every year as we receive 
great support from our customers who 
continuously purchase our new innovations 
and from all the brand awards which 
we receive yearly. A mark of a brand’s 
success also correlates with how much 
our customers trust us, and receiving those 
awards like the Putra Brand Awards and 
Reader’s Digest Trusted Brand Awards is a 
testament to their trust in us.
PC.com: Most of your advertising 
concept is adoption, why doesn’t 
Samsung come up with localised 
version for home markets?
Soh: We do both adoption and localisation 
for our marketing campaigns. However, 
we will evaluate the content beforehand 
to ensure that it is relevant to our local 
markets. If content and ideas are not in-line 
with how our costumers think and feel, we 
will develop a more localised campaign to 
suit the local flavour. 
PC.com: We don’t hear much on CSR 
or community projects; can you share 
some of your on-going and long-term 
activities?
Soh: Here at Samsung, we believe in 
giving back to the communities in which 
we operate in to create a better world. 
We deploy our technologies and expertise 
to address social issues. For example, 
Samsung operates 167 Smart Schools/
Libraries in the Southeast Asia and 
Oceania region, partnering with schools 
and libraries to create immersive learning 
opportunities for students through tailored 
education programs, with enrichment and 
infotainment contents. 
We have also created The Samsung 
Tech 
Institute 
in 
partnership 
with 
vocational institutions that makes use of 
Samsung’s technological resources in the 
provision of vocational training. Its aim is 
to enhance its students’ employability, and 
equip them with skills that prepare them 
for life in real-world industries. Samsung 
Tech Institutes also provide expert training, 
helping young people learn fundamental IT 
and engineering skills. Samsung operates 
20 such institutes in Cambodia, Indonesia, 
Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, the Philippines 
and Singapore.
PC.com: You have received many 
awards from brand perspective to 
marketing concepts, how much does 
this mean to you and your team?
Soh: Awards to us are an honour as it is a 
testimony of our hard work. However, the 
most important thing for us is creating an 
impact through our work. The fruits of our 
labour are the smiles on our customers 
face and their great feedback after using 
our products and services and how it has 
changed and enhanced their lives for 
the better.
PC.com: There are multiple platforms to 
choose from nowadays when it comes 
to A&P, how do you strike a balance in 
effectiveness? 
Soh: At Samsung, we are very mindful 
at choosing the best A&P platforms out 
there. This is also highly dependent on the 
campaigns, products and stories we are 
trying to introduce to the public. With that 
in mind, we also have our own internal best 
practices for our marketing campaigns which 
are developed after many trials and errors to 
create what we feel is the best balance and 
A&P mix.
PC.com: What do you see as a challenge 
in your line of work?
Soh: Being in an industry that moves fast 
does have its challenges. We must ensure 
and strive to be better and faster than our 
competitors. On top of that, we also have 
to consistently challenge ourselves to 
continuously innovate to be better than we 
were before ensuring our customers receive 
the best innovations and services.
PC.com: As a busy CMO of a large MNC 
and constantly in touch with tech, how 
do you spend your free time?
Soh: Family comes first to me. If I have 
free time, I spend it with my family and 
our favourite thing to do is bonding over 
our favourite movies or TV series at home, 
using the Samsung TV of course. Besides 
that, I also practice yoga, which teaches 
the same values that I subscribe to such as 
discipline and mindfulness. Practicing yoga 
has improved my overall well-being which 
reflects positively in my work as well.

TOMOTAKA TAKAHASHI’S IDEAL ROBOTS
FATHER OF THE 
ROBOT ASTRONAUT

101
AUG 2017
omotaka Takahashi is a Research 
Associate 
Professor 
of 
The 
University of Tokyo and a Visiting 
Professor of Osaka Electro-
Communication University. That’s 
what his profile on the ROBO GARAGE 
website reads.
What his profile doesn’t tell you 
– Takahashi created a robot that will 
be functional in outer space. Kirobo 
was the first robot astronaut developed 
to accompany Koichi Wakata, the first 
Japanese commander of the International 
Space Station during Expedition 39.
Takahashi founded ROBO GARAGE 
back in 1999, just after he graduated the 
university in Kyoto. He started the company 
with a simple goal – to create his ideal robot. 
Today, ROBO GARAGE sits in Tokyo and 
creates robots for the household.
The brother and prototype of Kirobo: 
Robi, is Takahashi’s latest creation, made 
with the aim of bringing families closer 
together. “I want robots to be more of a 
common thing, to become a family member 
and to be as popular as smartphones.”
Robi took three years to come to life 
from its initial conception. It now comes 
in 70 issues with over 400 parts, allowing 
users to build their own robot. From the day 
of its launch, Deagostini – Robi’s distributor 
– has seen 130,000 people subscribed to all 
issues. From Japan, Robi has also extended 
its footprint to Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, 
Singapore, Malaysia UK and Italy.
Inspired by Astroboy, the influence 
is apparent in the distinctive designs of 
Takahashi’s robots. Although, to Takahashi, 
every robot is just as unique, carrying 
its own characteristics and personality. 
However, Takahashi isn’t in a rush to make 
human-like robots yet. 
“As of now, robots are not smarter 
than human beings, so we shouldn’t be 
looking at making a robot in the shape of a 
human just yet.”
Takahashi believes that humans 
generally have a higher expectation for 
bigger robots. For a smaller robot to perform 
rudimentary tasks, compared to a bigger 
counterpart, the smaller robot will appeal to 
humans more easily. However, he laments 
that the current technology isn’t mature 
enough, where a robot is able to mimic 
human functions and perform multiple tasks. 
“I want to make robots smaller and 
smaller. The human shape isn’t a good idea 
(for robots) in performing different tasks.”
As of now, Robi is intentionally 
designed to be simple and productive. 
Sporting only infrared based human 
detection sensors, Takahashi omitted the 
use of optical sensors and other advanced 
hardware and software. 
“Nowadays many robots are fitted 
with optical sensors, but they cannot 
prepare enough software to make full 
use of that optical sensor.” He opted 
for less functionality in favour of a well-
designed machine. 
“We have so much advanced 
technology. But to use said technology and 
devices, it requires a lot of complicated 
software. We also need to add additional 
infrastructure for that feature, which also 
leads to delays and higher costs.”
Despite that, Takahashi kept the codes 
and data open. He encourages everyone 
to tinker around and hack the codes to 
customise Robi with their own programming. 
Unlike 
Toyota’s 
Kirobo 
Mini, 
Robi wouldn’t be coming in a smaller 
configuration. For Takahashi, robots 
should have certain functions, and 
Kirobo Mini doesn’t quite fit his ideals. 
“In my opinion, Kirobo Mini cannot do 
many functions. I believe he should have 
twice as much functions.”
In recent years, major tech companies 
including Amazon and Google have been 
upping their investments into robotics. 
“The field of robotics is so exciting right 
now. It started years ago and back then it 
was solely purposed for research. I like how 
things are right now, where the general 
expectations are getting higher.”

ybersecurity has gained a lot 
of attention in the last couple 
of years, no thanks to the 
increasing number of high 
profile cyberattacks across the globe. As 
more and more nations embark on smart city 
projects, reliance on data and connectivity 
will continue to rise dramatically across 
geographies and industries, giving cyber 
criminals even more avenues to carry out 
malicious activities. 
Today, 
cyber 
criminals 
are 
as sophisticated as ever and both 
governments and organisations are finding 
it hard to keep up. The recent outbreak 
of wannaCry and Petya ransomware are 
testament to the damage that a single 
piece of malware can cause. Overall, cyber 
criminals are becoming more strategic at 
targeting vital data across the healthcare, 
finance and public-sector verticals, raising 
the costs and stakes involved. in fact, 
according to the world economic Forum 
(weF), the cost of cybercrime to the global 
economy is currently estimated at US$445 
billion a year.
in 
this 
turbulent 
landscape, 
technology companies not only need 
to make cybersecurity a priority in the 
development of their solutions, but they 
also need to re-instil confidence in the 
market so that the progress of economies 
and smart cities or nations are not 
curtailed by the fear of cyberattacks. 
To do this, a multi-pronged strategy and 
concerted effort across governments 
and organisations is required. 
Outsmart the enemy 
The dearth of cybersecurity professionals 
will continue to plague the industry 
as the cybersecurity sector’s global 
workforce shortage is projected to 
reach 1.8 million by 2022, while the 
amount of data collected, analysed, 
and stored will continue to increase 
exponentially. This means that there 
are simply not enough humans to 
process the data for cybersecurity 
detection and prevention. 
The good news is, cybersecurity 
vendors are accelerating their research 
and ramping up solutions to meet 
today’s challenges. One major trend 
we are seeing is the implementation 
of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial 
intelligence (Ai) to detect and respond 
to cyberattacks. One example is Apache 
Spot, an open source cybersecurity 
project that uses ML as a filter for 
separating bad traffic from benign and 
to characterise the unique behaviour 
of network traffic, giving organisations 
the ability to analyse large data sets 
quickly, leading to better and faster 
threat detection.  
The revival of Ai and ML is a rosy 
development for Chief Security Officers 
(CSOs) as it can help address several 
of their common pain points. if we 
can offload tasks to ML and Ai, while 
harnessing the scarce human expertise 
for decision-making, our cybersecurity 
infrastructure can become more robust 
and cost-efficient. 
The bottom line is, all solution 
providers, be it internet of Things (ioT), 
fintech, biotech, or data analytics, must 
make innovation in cybersecurity a priority 
in the development of their solutions to 
stay one step ahead of cyber criminals 
and meet customer expectations. 
All together now
There is also an urgent need for public and 
private stakeholders to carry out diplomatic 
dialogues and share threat intelligence as 
cybercrime is not something that can be dealt 
with in silo. Unlike physical crimes, it is not 
bound by geography or jurisdiction and cyber 
criminals will have no qualms with exploiting 
the weakest link to launch regional or even 
global attacks. 
Recognising that cybercrime cannot 
be tackled unilaterally, information-
sharing platforms have sprung up around 
the world, such as the Cyber-Security 
information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) 
in the United Kingdom and the national 
Cybersecurity 
and 
Communications 
integration Center (nCCiC) in the United 
States. Closer to home, the inTeRPOL 
world 2017 congress recently held in 
Singapore served as a neutral platform 
for the public and private sectors to share 
information for a more unified approach 
to cyber security in the region. These are 
all positive developments that require 
the critical support of all stakeholders 
to prevail and governments should take 
the lead in promoting a landscape of 
collaboration and transparency to catalyse 
action and change.
Today, the odds are not in our favour 
and we need to move away from the reactive 
approach to cybersecurity that we are long 
accustomed to. instead, we should adopt a 
proactive approach, encompassing robust 
cybersecurity infrastructures built on the 
latest technology, coupled with the collective 
efforts of all stakeholders in contributing to 
an open and cohesive environment that this 
region’s smart city building efforts can rely 
on as a backdrop for progress.

GREAT
ith the 90s being the hip 
nostalgic era to pine for, it was 
no surprise that Crash Bandicoot 
received a much-anticipated 
remaster of the first three games in the 
series, Crash Bandicoot, Cortex Strikes 
Back and Warped.  Developed by Vicarious 
Visions and published by Activision 
exclusively for the PlayStation 4, it’s safe 
to say that the N-Sane Trilogy is a faithful 
remaster with a whole truckload of visual 
polish applied to it.
Taking it Back to the Nineties
To the uninitiated, Crash Bandicoot was 
original a 3D platformer released for 
the first ever PlayStation back in the 
90s. Crash Bandicoot, the titular mascot 
of the franchise, had to jump or spin 
his way through enemies and collect 
delicious fruit hidden in boxes or littered 
throughout each stage. Stages could be 
re-attempted after your first clear as 
time trials or to collect extra bonuses 
that are hidden in the level. 
Vicarious Visions had to rebuilt 
the game from scratch as much of the 
original data was either lost or couldn’t 
be translated to today’s modern gaming 
architecture. Their hard work in the 
game is evident; it shines as the level of 
graphical polish is clean, colourful and it 
was easy to mistake some of the close-
up sequences as pre-rendered cutscenes. 
While some may grumble about this, 
the frame rate too has been locked to 
30fps, which to be fair, is an accurate 
representation of the original games. 
While the frame rates might be locked, 
Crash Bandicoot: N-Sane Trilogy will play 
at UHD or 4K resolutions.
Keeping to its Roots
While all three games look amazing, the 
music too has been completely remastered 
in all its nostalgic glory. Having recently 
played the original trilogy on an emulator, 
I found the huge jump in sound quality to 
be as impactful as the new graphics, if 
not more. It was comforting to also know 
that the original voice actors were brought 
in once more for some newly recorded 
dialogue. The combination of bright and 
cheerful graphics with a fun soundtrack 
make the N-Sane Trilogy a winner in the 
aesthetics department.
Another great aspect to take note 
is the use of Josh Mancell, who was the 
composer in the original series. This shows 
the amount of detail Vicarious Visions took 
into ensuring the game is modernised but 
still a classic in many elements.
Old and Still Gold
Now, The N-Sane Trilogy takes you back 
to a time where hand-holding, constant 
autosaves and checkpoints were just 
a twinkle in the mind’s eye. A gamer’s 
mettle was built by enduring the constant 
repetition of clearing frustratingly hard 
levels. The first hour of gameplay was 
great fun but once the effects of nostalgia 
wore off, I began to wonder if Crash 
Bandicoot was always this difficult. 
W
Have my gaming reflexes been dulled by 
modern game design sensibilities or was 
the game always this frustrating?
When it comes right down to it, yes, 
the game was always this difficult and 
yes, due to life commitments, I haven’t 
been clocking in the gaming hours as I 
used to as a plucky youngster. Don’t get 
me wrong, this game is a heap of fun. 
As an old-school platformer, it offers 
adequate challenge and clearing a level 
flawlessly on the first playthrough is 
incredibly satisfying. Like riding a bike, 
this game gets better as you put more 
effort and time into it.
The afterglow of nostalgia will 
eventually wear off and the problems 
faced in the original trilogy also rears 
its ugly head after 20 odd years. The 
racing levels are still as frustrating as I 
remember it to be and imprecise jumps 
are punished horribly but even with all its 
imperfections, Crash Bandicoot: N-Sane 
Trilogy is a much-welcomed platformer. 
It’s tough by today’s standards but still fun 
after all these years.

WHAT IS 
DEAD MAY

Diablo III: Rise of the Necromancer
y earliest memory of playing Diablo was back when 
Diablo II was all the hype in a random cyber café, using 
my friend’s account without his knowledge. I had very 
little knowledge on computer games back then, (my 
parents believed video games would fry my brain) so I had absolutely 
no clue as to what I was doing. All I could remember was selling off 
all my friend’s armour and weapons just so I could get more gold. To 
this day, he still doesn’t know who ‘hacked’ his account.
This latest DLC from Blizzard Entertainment now gives 
gamers a brand-new character class: Necromancer alongside 
a new gameplay element along with it. Although I’m not a 
big fan of Blizzard because Overwatch killed Borderlands, I 
was willing to give this a try solely because I didn’t have a 
choice (I kid, of course).
Keeping Things Interesting
After breezing through the first mission (I couldn’t believe it was 
that easy), I finally developed a rhythm with the game. First off, 
I am not a fan as of the hero movements in the game. Sure, it’s 
been there for a long time but coming from a Dota background 
where the right-click is meant to move the hero while the left-
click is your action command.
In Diablo III, both buttons are your movement buttons as 
well as being your two starting abilities. This was infuriating for

fence about the entire storyline in general as it was compelling enough 
to keep me entertained but not so interesting to the point I’d drop 
everything to play it.
I guess with Diablo III, it’s all about getting the raids done with 
your friends, which is quite disappointing as I only have a handful of 
friends who play Diablo III and all refuse to play with me because I 
am too low level and 
will only slow them 
down (I don’t know if 
I should laugh or cry 
to that statement).
Final Thoughts
Being a born-again 
first-time 
Diablo 
player, I must say, the 
game has grown a 
lot. Gone are the days 
of shitty graphics 
and bad gameplay 
mechanics. Although 
it does lag a bit here 
and there when the 
graphics 
get 
too 
intense, the overall 
gameplay of the Rise 
of the Necromancer 
DLC 
was 
pretty 
awesome. If you’re a

the first five minutes as it did take me some time to adjust (I am 
a seasoned semi-professional, mind you).
But, I soon realised that playing Diablo III will actually 
help me improve my Dota mechanic skills. Instead of having 
to right-click further away just to move, it requires shorter 
distance clicks so I wouldn’t accidentally cast a spell on an 
unknown enemy (especially if that enemy has the ability to gut 
me in half with one attack).
Killing is Fun Again
Although levelling up the character does take some time (which 
is hard seeing as I have a social life), I did manage to get a few 
levels onto my character. With new abilities unlocked, you can 
create combos with your abilities like summoning the dead to 
do battle on your behalf (I am a necromancer after all), causing 
spikes to erupt from the earth and turning corpses into bombs. 
Oh, the joy of killing is addictive.
Another strategy into hitting massive massacre combos 
(which grants you added experience gain bonus) is to find a huge 
group of undead and drawing them into a tight space while nuking 
them down. Once you have a fresh batch of carcases, drag the next 
group of enemies close to the same spot and blow them up.
However, I do quite enjoy the Necromancer’s ability to 
raise the dead as it does tend to get quite lonely when you’re 
gaming alone. With a helpful undead doing my bidding, at 
least he can keep me some company while I traverse through 
dungeons, cemeteries and dark forests all alone. If you decide 
not to detonate the dead corpses, you can summon an army of 
skeletons; how cool is that!
I Need More Friends
As far as the storyline goes, the latest DLC from Diablo III isn’t 
that great nor is it that boring. I guess you could say I’m on the

HEADSHOTS ARE 
NECESSARY

By Teh Wi-Liam
Hitman: Sniper
ave you ever watched a movie and 
within the first 15 minutes, want to 
be just like the main character? I’m 
sure we’ve all had those moments 
with such popularised movie characters 
like James Bond, Indiana Jones, Lara Croft 
and Carrie Bradshaw, to name a few (in 
my defense, I thought she was beautiful). 
Another character that I always admired 
on the silver screen was Agent 47 from the 
Hitman movies. From his cool, cold and calm 
demeanour to his three-piece suits and skill 
set that would send shivers down anyone’s 
spine, Agent 47 was a cold-blooded killer 
that would kill anyone if the money was 
good. As much as I wanted to be a hired 
assassin like him, I could never imagine 
having a barcode tattoo on my neck or even 
going bald so I guess playing him in a video 
game would be the next best option.
Trigger Finger Happy
Unlike most other Hitman video games, 
Hitman: Sniper doesn’t take you into the 
thick of the action. Gone are the days of 
putting a bullet between your enemy’s 
eyes or driving through their skull with a 
drill; Hitman: Sniper is all about precision, 
patience and accuracy as you will be 
targeting enemies from a great distance 
with a sniper rifle.
You 
will 
be 
given 
missions 
throughout the course of the game where 
you will have to eliminate high priority 
targets along with other objectives. While 
some objectives are straightforward 
(taking out two enemies with one bullet), 
there are some, which are just ridiculous 
requests and have mistaken me for James 
Bond (getting three consecutive headshots 
in less than 10 seconds).
One mechanic that will take some 
time getting used to is moving the scope 
around as it is highly sensitive, even after 
reducing the sensitivity in the settings 
menu. There is also a manual reload 
system every time you finish a clip, which 
requires three different swipe actions to 
complete. Otherwise, you take longer 
than usual to reload as you see Agent 47 
fumbling with a new clip.
More Ways Than One to Kill
You are given plenty different guns to 
choose from, all of which come with 
different abilities and can be upgraded 
for better performances (with a price, of 
course). Some rifles come with added 
lung capacity so you can hold your 
breath longer to better steady your aim 
while others come with an explosive 
bullet and even an auto-tracking 
bullet. Of course, much like any other 
smartphone game, you will have to pay 
for a few items that cannot be bought 
with regular in-game currency (I wonder 
what real hitmen would say to these 
sort of payment schemes).
To unlock new guns, you will 
need to first pick-up the blueprints for 
it and then slowly work your way into 
collecting the parts needed for said

gun. It will take a long while as after 
each mission, there will be a random 
drop, which sometimes won’t even 
be a component for the gun but small 
amounts of cash.
There will be instances during 
the game where you won’t even have 
to kill your enemies, but simply make 
their deaths look like an ‘accident’. As 
it is an actual objective, you will be 
required to sometimes drop an enemy 
on top of another, killing both or even 
setting up an explosion on a control 
panel and blowing it up the moment 
an enemy is spotted nearby. Although 
not as ingenious as drilling holes into 
someone’s body, it’s the next best thing.
Weirdly Addictive
At first, I thought this game would get boring 
after the first few rounds as there was no 
originality in its gameplay. However, I found 
myself slowly getting addicted to it, mainly 
because the game feeds off my need for 
perfection when it comes to video games. 
The fact that I will need to kill off every 
single member before my main target is a 
challenge and I intend to see it to the end.
If you’re looking for a game to take 
your mind off things for a good few hours 
as you blow their brains away, Hitman: 
Sniper can do just that. However, be 
sure to note that this isn’t how a sniper 
rifle usually works because the recoil 
motion hurts like hell.

Woody & Buzz Make Their Debut In KH III
A Friend in Us
rguably one of the most popular 
games during the PS1 and PS2 
days, the Kingdom Hearts series 
revealed a brand-new trailer 
during Disney’s annual expo – D23. Said 
trailer features recurring main characters: 
Sora, Goofy and Donald in the new world 
of Andy’s room from the much loved 90’s 
cartoon, Toy Story.
This will go along well with the 
other new worlds featured in Kingdom 
Hearts III (KH III) like the universe of 
Big Hero 6 and Tangled. Aside from 
releasing the trailer, Kingdom Hearts 
III also received a release date in 2018 
for both the PS4 and Xbox One console. 
To salivate avid KH III, the game is 
available for pre-order right now on 
Amazon. Hopefully the PS Store will 
come with its own pre-order bundle as 
well and I for one, expect goodies to 
come with it.
Here’s to hoping a new trailer for 
the Final Fantasy VII remake will be 
revealed during PSX, seeing as the lore 
of Final Fantasy played a big role in 
both KH I and KH II.

“They said he could level a skyscraper.”
Make Room for Doom
he hype train has finally 
reached the station with 
Overwatch introducing its 
latest playable character: 
Doomfist. For those who are unfamiliar 
with the lore, Doomfist is a title that 
has been carried by three individuals, 
mainly Adhabu Ngumi, known as the 
Savior, Akinjide Adeyemi, known as 
the Scourge, and Akande Ogundimu, 
known as the Successor. The playable 
character will be Ogundimo as he has 
killed Adeyemi to take the title for his 
own gain.

Doomfist can deal ranged damage 
from his Hand Cannon while his melee 
ability is Rising Uppercut. Doomfist will 
also have two special abilities: Seismic 
Slam and Rocket Punch. He also has an 
ultimate ability: Meteor Strike.
T
After much anticipation and 
speculation about the man providing 
the voice for Doomfist, many fans 
– present company included – were 
distraught to hear that it will sadly not 
be Terry Crews doing the voice-over. 
That role will go to Sahr Ngaujah, an 
American theatre director and actor. 
Although we’re sure Blizzard wouldn’t 
pick a bad voice actor to play Doomfist, 
it is still quite saddening to know 
it wouldn’t be Terry Crew’s voice, 
especially after getting used to all his 
Old Spice commercials.

to bring its most popular game to allow

Gods that it will happen one day.

A Whole New World
Rating: [9/10]
Sony Bravia A1 55-inch 4K HDR OLED TV 
Sony is not one to shy away from making bold statements, be it through design or technological innovations. 
While it is true that Sony is a latecomer in adopting the OLED technology, its Bravia series forges through with 
a beautiful offering that can easily rival its competitors.
Bold Aspirations
The Sony Bravia A1 55-inch 4K HDR OLED TV is a sight to behold. It is unapologetically slim and sharp, with an 
awe-inspiring design twist at the back. It boldly claims to deliver a viewing experience that is akin to reality. 
Through its 4K HDR Processor X1™ Extreme processor, the Bravia A1 delivers more of everything: power, 
performance and beauty. It provides viewers 40% more real-time image processing. It also takes everything 
you watch and upscaled it to near 4K HDR quality.

Delivering the Best
OLED panels are fast-becoming a favourite amongst 
connoisseurs. Unlike older generation panels, with 
OLED, viewers can experience true depth and colour. 
With over eight million self-illuminating, individually 
controlled OLED pixels, the Bravia A1 presents an 
enthralling experience like to other. Sony’s OLED pixels 
work individually, thus able to be turned off completely 
to delivery pitch black pictures. Viewers will be able to 
experience real black, incredible contrast and lifelike 
colour. An added bonus with using OLED is the superb 
viewing angle, which many deem important when 
having friends and family over for movie night. 
Graceful Stature 
With the design of the Bravia A1, Sony seeks to push 
the TV aesthetic beyond the traditional realms of 
furniture and interior design. Sony’s One Slate concept 
is bold, yet exudes a sense of grace and delicacy. 
However, it is by no means fragile. The brand takes 
on an approach that condenses a given product into 
a single slate, giving the Bravia A1 a natural elegance 
for users to experience as a work of art. 
Sounds like a Dream
Complementing 
its 
One 
Slate 
concept, 
Sony 
introduces the Acoustic Surface™ Technology – an 
innovative feature that will further enhance your 
viewing experience. Unlike most TV speakers in the 
market, the Bravia A1’s sound is emitted from the 
entire screen. This is an act of genius on Sony’s part; 
the brand has placed twin actuators on each side, 
cleverly hidden and flushed behind the slim panel. The 
sound is further complemented by a woofer placed in 
the stand.
