Authors’ Acknowledgments
Joel Scott: No one writes a book alone. Perhaps it’s possible for a work of fic-
tion. But even then, a collection of editors and technicians all have some say
in the appearance of the work. It seems unlikely that one or two people can
bring a book from the starting line to the finish line by themselves.
First and foremost, I need to thank my co-author, Dave Lee. Our early brain-
storming sessions about this book and continuing communications made this
writing easier. 
I also want to thank everyone in my office and at home for taking up the slack
while I was so often sitting in my room moaning and groaning over words I
had written and rewritten so many times.
David Lee: Of all the books and articles that I have ever written, this one took
the most teamwork. I could never have completed this book and still run
Vertical Marketing without a huge amount of help from my secretary, Jennifer
Slusher. She reviewed all my work, did all the screen captures (a much
tougher job than you might imagine), and updated text based on feedback
from the editor and the technical editor. She now knows Microsoft CRM so
well that I will probably have to make her a trainer or a designer.
I also need to thank my friend, partner, competitor, and co-author, Joel. He
was willing to risk a more than ten-year friendship by asking me to co-author
this book. Despite the late nights and deadlines, I still like the guy.
Our technical editor, Ben Vollmer, is also a personal friend. As a Microsoft
employee, he has a different perspective on the system. His advice and sup-
port have been invaluable.
Susan Pink, our editor, must have the patience of Methuselah. Wiley Press
has some pretty specific editorial rules. Working with both Joel and me in
that framework has to be harder than herding cats. She somehow managed to
keep us on track and pretty much on schedule. 
I would also like to thank my staff. With the new release of Microsoft 3.0, we
have been extremely busy. They have taken up the slack whenever they were
asked so that I could have the time I needed to write.
Finally, I would like to thank you for your interest in Microsoft CRM. CRM is
my passion (I am a pretty dull guy), and it is people like you who allow me to
do the work that I love.

Microsoft CRM 3 For Dummies

Introduction
T
his book is about Microsoft Dynamics CRM Version 3.0, which we refer to
as simply Microsoft CRM or just CRM. We assume that Microsoft CRM just
showed up on your desktop computer or notebook. Chances are, you already
have some experience with one or more of the popular predecessors to CRM —
ACT, GoldMine, SalesLogix, or an earlier release of Microsoft CRM. Or maybe
you’ve never had any kind of CRM system — and never wanted one either. In
any event, now you have to get yourself up and running with this new soft-
ware. If you relate to any of this, Microsoft CRM 3 For Dummies is for you.
If you’re a technical type looking for help with installation, integration, or
serious customization, you’ll need more than just this book. You’ll need
some technical references, an experienced dealer, and some time.
If nothing else, Microsoft CRM is an organizational tool. Whether you’re in
sales, marketing, customer service, or management, this software will pro-
vide a significant return on your investment — whether that investment is
money or time. Beyond that, if you’ve fallen in love with Microsoft Outlook
and refuse to relinquish it, relax. Not only can you still use Outlook, it’s one
of the primary means by which you’ll communicate with Microsoft CRM.
How CRM Fits in the Market
Microsoft has come to the CRM market seemingly a little late but with a
system built on a platform called .NET. With CRM, you work in networked
mode or in offline mode. Networked mode does not require a direct con-
nection to your office file server. In fact, with .NET technology, networked
actually means connected to the server through the Internet. Offline mode
also takes great advantage of the Internet but enables you to work while 
disconnected by using a tool that Outlook users will find familiar.
The software itself is aimed at small businesses with a basic infrastructure,
medium-sized companies, or departments of large enterprises. Typically, if
you have more than ten users, and like the look and feel of Outlook, you’re a
prime candidate for success with CRM. If you have fewer than ten users, you
may want to look at Microsoft Business Contact Manager, which is a free add-
on to Outlook 2003 for small businesses.

If you have an IT department comfortable with the care and feeding of servers
and have Internet connectivity with good firewalls and security, you should
consider installing and using CRM. Otherwise, you can have CRM hosted.
The hosting company maintains the equipment and software in return for a
monthly check. For more information, see Chapter 28.
How to Use This Book
Microsoft CRM is divided into five major sections: Workplace, Sales, Marketing,
Service, and Settings. This book loosely follows these themes. We describe
navigating the workplace and CRM in general in Chapter 2. In Part II, you find
out all about setting up the system. Then we jump into sales topics, a little
marketing, and some customer service.
You should be able to comfortably read the book from start to finish, but
for those of you so caffeinated you can’t sit still that long (don’t laugh, you
know who you are), each chapter can stand on its own as reference material.
Either way, you have a comprehensive guide to Microsoft CRM.
You’ll get the most benefit from this book by sitting in front of your com-
puter with CRM on the screen. It’s easy to convince yourself that you’ve 
got it by just reading, but there’s no substitute for trying the steps yourself.
Experimenting with sample data is sometimes just the ticket to an epiphany.
Foolish Assumptions
We assume you have some basic computer and Windows skills. If you aren’t
comfortable with Windows, you need to get yourself up to speed in this area.
Find a local class or seminar, or get one of the For Dummies books on Windows.
Regarding CRM, however, we assume you just returned from a long mission
to Mars and need to start using CRM tomorrow.
We also assume you have a basic understanding of database concepts. If you’re
comfortable with fields, records, files, folders, and how they relate to each
other, you’ll be fine. If you’re familiar with attributes, entities, instances, and
objects, even better. If this is already sounding bad, you can seek help at most
community colleges or local computer training facilities.

Microsoft CRM 3 For Dummies 

If you’re going to be your own CRM administrator (backing up files and assign-
ing usernames, passwords, and access rights), you need to understand records,
files, folders, security, operating systems, and networks. If you just want to be
a good day-to-day user of CRM, make sure that you understand what a file is
and how to locate one using Explorer.
How This Book Is Organized
Some people just have a knack for organization. Our office manager is highly
organized, although her desk looks like a tornado swept through it. However,
she assures us that she knows exactly where everything should be (and we take
no responsibility for her actions if you touch anything). Anyway, we digress.
Organization — without it, this book would be a jumbled mess. To cure that,
we’ve organized the book into six parts, each with at least two chapters.
Again, the book can be read from cover to cover (who has that kind of time?)
or you can refer to it section by section. Each part (and chapter) can definitely
stand on its own, but we recommend that you at least skim through the basics
and the table of contents before getting started.
Part I: Microsoft CRM Basics
Just the facts! Part I gives you an overview of what Microsoft CRM is all
about and provides a tour of the main windows. We also show you how
to use Microsoft CRM offline.
Part II: Setting the Settings
In Part II, we begin with a discussion of how to personalize your workplace
and the software. The workplace is command central in Microsoft CRM.
From the workplace, you can access the day-to-day stuff, such as your 
calendar, assigned activities, and service scheduling. You can also set up
business units, security, sales processes, and business rules. Workflow, just
so you know, is managed not directly from CRM but from a separate program.
Getting to that program and using it is discussed in Chapter 8. The knowledge
base, discussed in Chapter 9, collects information for everyone in your orga-
nization needing to support staff or clients.

Introduction

Part III: Managing Sales
In Part III, we explain how to create accounts and contacts in your database
and how to locate existing records with Version 3’s rebuilt-from-the-ground-up
search features. We also show you how to create and manage activities as well
as leads, opportunities, and territories. You find how-to information on notes,
attachments, and all things e-mail. Then we get into the nitty-gritty and discuss
some of the408 more complex functions of Microsoft CRM, such as the prod-
uct catalog, quotes, orders, and invoices (some of which require integration
with an accounting system). In addition, we talk about sales literature and
how to track competitors.
Part IV: Making the Most of Marketing
Microsoft CRM Version 3 explodes with all kinds of capability in the market-
ing arena. Combining the new Advanced Find function with Quick Campaigns
and a sophisticated Campaign Management system, Microsoft CRM enables
you to do more than just send out e-mails and letters. You’ll be able to follow
the progress of the campaign, create and delegate tasks, keep track of actual
costs compared to the campaign budget, and easily catalog and maintain the
responses.
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers
Customer service is a big issue, no matter how big your company. In this
part, we show you how to track and manage customer service issues using
cases and the special Service Calendar. We talk about workflow and your
business processes and how Microsoft CRM can easily handle incoming ser-
vice calls and e-mail and their responses using queues. We discuss contracts
and tiered levels of customer service and how to organize this division to
handle service issues efficiently and quickly.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
As new as Microsoft CRM is, third-party developers have brought many com-
plementary products to the market. We discuss the best and most useful we’ve
found. And, just in case you still need assistance, we also discuss ten ways to
get help.

Microsoft CRM
Basics

In this part . . .
M
icrosoft Dynamics CRM 3.0 is technically an update
to Version 1.0 (and 1.2), but it’s really a quantum
leap beyond what first came out almost three years ago.
Microsoft CRM integrates with Outlook and the web and is
now much easier to use. If you’re one of the 92 million
Outlook users, Microsoft CRM is the comfortable, organi-
zational upgrade you’re looking for.
In this first part, you find a general discussion of the fea-
tures and benefits of Microsoft CRM and how best to navi-
gate through the screens. In addition, we discuss the
online versus offline use of Microsoft CRM.

P
ersonal Information Managers (PIM) and Contact Management Systems
(CMS) were introduced in the mid-1980s. Both PIM and CMS systems
enabled you to organize the names, addresses, and phone numbers for all
your business contacts. PIMs were superseded by Sales Force Automation
(SFA) systems in the late 1980s. Products such as ACT and GoldMine initially
combined scheduling functions with contact management. By the mid-1990s,
these systems evolved into simple Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
systems, attempting to involve not just salespeople but also customer service
and management.
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 3.0 (that’s the official name) is the next generation of
CRM systems. Microsoft CRM is based on .NET (pronounced dot-net) technol-
ogy, pioneered by Microsoft. Not only does Microsoft CRM have functionality
for sales, customer service, and now marketing, it takes great advantage of the
Internet, or more specifically, web services. This web service focus is what
defines the .NET strategy. In a nutshell, web services enable applications to
be easily integrated, rapidly configured to meet your business needs, and
extended to both internal and external users.

Tracking Your Contacts
Microsoft CRM has a record type or entity called a contact. A contact, in this
sense, is a person. It is a concept taken from Microsoft Outlook. In fact, con-
tact records from Outlook are directly transferable into contact records in
Microsoft CRM.
Microsoft CRM calls company records accounts. Companies (accounts) and
the people who work at each of them (contacts) can be related to one another
within the system.
A contact is a person and an account is a company. A customer is either a
person or a company.
We often hear company executives say that their most important corporate
asset is their database of prospects and clients. We couldn’t agree more.
Neglecting, for the moment, all the powerful tools within CRM, the most basic
thing is what pays off the quickest. And that quick payoff results from having
one central, organized, accessible repository for all the information relating
to your customers and prospects. Even if you never create any workflow rules,
never connect the system to a web site, or never automate your quotation
system, you will be miles ahead just by organizing your data into one coher-
ent database.
You want to store other kinds of information in Microsoft CRM, too. The system
is going to be your universal reference tool — your Rolodex, your personnel
directory, and your Yellow Pages all in one place. You also want to have records
for vendors, employees, and competitors.
In addition, Microsoft CRM holds important information that will help you
manage and make better-informed decisions about your business. That informa-
tion includes opportunities to track your sales cycles, cases to track customer
service issues, and campaigns to track the results of your marketing campaigns.
Communicating with the Outside World
Far and away, the primary reason that companies lose accounts is that the
customer thinks no one is paying attention. Microsoft CRM gives you the
tools to counteract this perception, which, with regard to your firm, is cer-
tainly a wrong one. Right?
A handful of ways exist to communicate with customers, and CRM handles
most of them:
10
Part I: Microsoft CRM Basics 

 Scheduling calls and appointments: Of course, you will be scheduling
all your calls and all your appointments using CRM through Outlook.
 Faxing: This is built into Microsoft CRM Small Business Edition.
 E-mailing: Outlook is the champion of all e-mail systems. It is practically
the de facto standard. Whether you are operating in online or offline
mode, you have the ability to integrate your e-mail with the CRM system.
This includes the ability to create e-mail templates and e-mail merge
documents to rapidly communicate with your customers.
 Printing: You can merge and print letters as long as you have Microsoft
Word (which, as part of the Microsoft family of products, is well-integrated
with CRM).
Integrating with Accounting
In the early years of CRM systems, many companies were reluctant to allow
their salespeople access to accounting information. Fortunately, the pendulum
has swung back, with the best thinkers realizing that it’s helpful for salespeople
to have more knowledge, not less. Microsoft has developed links to a line of
applications it owns called Dynamics (of which Microsoft Dynamics CRM is a
part). These links include the ability to share customer information, product
information, and invoice and billing information.
Links to other accounting packages, such as those from Intuit and Sage SAP,
are provided by third-party developers.
Why integrate?
Surely, no sales manager wants his or her people spending their time trying to
close another deal with an existing customer when that customer has not paid
for the previous six orders stretching over the last eight months. Nor would a
discerning sales manager want a salesperson quoting a deal that would put cus-
tomers over their existing credit limit without taking the credit situation into
account. By integrating Microsoft CRM with your accounting system, your users
and sales managers have the information they need to avoid these situations.
Conversely, before a credit manager calls an existing client in an effort to col-
lect a past-due payment, it may be important for the manager to understand
that the sales department is on the verge of closing a megadeal with that very
same client. Although the credit department would certainly want to collect
that money, understanding the current sales situation may affect how the
credit manager’s conversation is conducted.
11
Chapter 1: Taking a First Look at Microsoft CRM 3

Other accounting systems
Most competitors claim to have integration with one or more accounting
packages. Most of the time, a third party does this integration, and that 
situation has some major disadvantages. If you are relying on three separate
companies — your CRM vendor, your accounting vendor, and a third-party
developer — to keep your front-office and back-office operation coordinated,
you could be in trouble.
One of the ongoing problems occurs when your CRM vendor or your account-
ing vendor upgrades. That upgrade immediately requires an upgrade to at least
one of the other packages. Microsoft has gone a long way toward solving this
dilemma because it controls both ends and the middle. Look for integration
that is much better coordinated than what has been available in the past.
Setting Up Business Processes
One of the most powerful features in Microsoft CRM is workflow rules. These
rules provide a way to automate many routine functions in your organization,
such as following up with standard letters after an appointment or alerting
members of your team to account-related deadlines.
If you prefer to have Microsoft CRM work for you, rather than you work for it,
you should consider implementing workflow rules after you get past the ini-
tial effort of organizing all your data.
Every business has processes. Sometimes, they aren’t well documented, so
they aren’t obvious. An example of a process is how your company handles
leads from prospective customers.
While designing and customizing your soon-to-be CRM system, you should
also analyze (and improve) all your processes.
Good process development has several basic principles:
 Assigning tasks: The first principle is properly assigning responsibility.
Each task that needs to be accomplished should have one primary person
assigned to it, not a team of people.
 Feedback: Every step of every task should be confirmed. Amazon.com
has this procedure down pat. If you’re not sure about proper feedback,
order a book from Amazon. Almost any For Dummies book will do.
12
Part I: Microsoft CRM Basics 

When you place the order, you get an order confirmation. When the
book is shipped, you get a shipping confirmation. And you may very
well get some after-the-fact follow-up (all in an effort, of course, to sell
you more books). Their process is well done, and you may want to pat-
tern your processes after theirs.
 Escalation: Just because a phone call has been assigned, don’t assume
that it will be completed. Plan your processes under the assumption
that, even with the best of intentions, things fall through the cracks.
Give each team member a reasonable amount of time to accomplish a
task. If the task isn’t completed, make sure that the next person on your
organization chart is notified. Continue escalating and notifying until
something is done about the situation.
 Reporting and measuring: It isn’t a real process unless you can measure
it and then improve it. Design into each process an appropriate report
that allows the necessary analysis that leads to continual improvement.
A good way to begin designing a process is to mock up the reports first.
These reports help determine what data is necessary for proper tracking.
With workflow rules, you can program the business processes you design.
Workflow rules can access any of the data files in Microsoft CRM and create
activities for your users or send out correspondence through fax or e-mail.
These rules can notify you of overdue activities and can escalate important
issues.
13
Chapter 1: Taking a First Look at Microsoft CRM 3
Some of the best new stuff in Version 3
Chapter 29 details the ten best new features in
this Version of Microsoft CRM. Microsoft made
a quantum leap with Version 3 — so much so
that they decided to forego calling this latest
release Version 2. (Versions 1.0 and 1.2 are the
immediate predecessors of this version.)
Microsoft has worked to improve usability and
has increased functionality. Both were major
issues before, and both issues should now be
laid to rest.
In addition, there aren’t nearly as many sepa-
rate windows to click through. It’s harder to get
lost inside the system. More information is dis-
played in each window. All good things.
Marketing has been added. The Advanced Find
feature now let’s you locate records much more
easily and across more than just one entity.
After you’ve created a good search query, you
can save it for future use. CRM integrates nicely
with both Word and Excel, and you will probably
make extensive use of this connection when
writing quotes and reports.
The very best thing is that Version 3 is a plea-
sure to use.

Implementing business processes within the scope of workflow rules is the
heart and mind of a good CRM system and is also probably the most under-
utilized area of CRM. Too often, companies relax after their data is properly
imported and their users have received a little training. Properly implemented
workflow rules will pay you back for your investment many times over.
Do not neglect this powerful feature!
Coordinating Microsoft CRM 
with Your Success Plan
A disappointing number of CRM projects don’t live up to their expectations.
The first issue to consider is the one of expectations. The second issue
involves planning.
If all your expectations are built on what you heard from your salesperson or
what you read in the promotional materials, you may be in for an unpleasant
surprise. And, of course, the old axiom applies: If you fail to plan, you plan to
fail. Microsoft has released a comprehensive CRM planning guide. It’s avail-
able on their web site or at www.ccc24k.com.
Defining your goals
You may be tempted to wing it. Maybe someone promised the sales staff that
a system would be in place before the next annual sales meeting. That was
11 months ago. If you’re thinking you have a month to buy the software and
get it implemented, forget about it. Your project should be done in bite-sized
chunks with measurable goals at each step.
The first step in a project with the complexity of a Microsoft CRM implemen-
tation is to do a needs analysis. Most of the more sophisticated dealers will
do this for you, although you should expect to pay for it. Some dealers offer a
free needs analysis. Remember, you always get what you pay for.
A true needs analysis involves interviewing representatives from each depart-
ment that will be using the system. It involves collecting a considerable amount
of information on what is being done at your company today and how you
want that to change. It involves determining what software may meet your
requirements and does not presume that it is necessarily Microsoft CRM or
any other system. A needs analysis includes detailed pricing, schedules, and
the assignment of responsibilities.
14
Part I: Microsoft CRM Basics 

We think a good needs analysis (or at least a detailed, written plan) is an
essential ingredient to a successful implementation.
Microsoft provides some documents if you decide to go it alone. Look in the
Implementation Guide for basic planning documents to make sure you get the
most out of your system,
Implementing a pilot program
Everyone is conservative by nature when thinking about spending money.
So a pilot program is often a useful way to make sure the project will be suc-
cessful. Typically, a pilot program involves a select group of users, not the
entire company. If you’re going to go this route, make it a representative sample,
not just the brightest or most enthusiastic people and not just people in one
small department.
Most projects never get beyond the pilot stage because a hundred or a 
thousand steps are needed to implement any project like this successfully.
Invariably, as the pilot project struggles to the finish line, you find two or
three nagging items that have not been conquered. And these unresolved
items are what everyone is suddenly focused on. In some people’s minds,
these unfinished items remain a good reason to declare failure or to refuse
to move on to the full rollout.
Before beginning a pilot, you must define what determines success. These
conditions must be written down and known to all. If they are met, full
rollout should be triggered automatically.
15
Chapter 1: Taking a First Look at Microsoft CRM 3
Making Microsoft CRM part of your 
client-retention program
Out of the box, Microsoft CRM comes prepared
to assist you with closing business with new
customers. It has records for leads that are
expected to grow into opportunities. It has fields
in the account and contact records that are
meant to assist you in organizing your efforts to
make a deal.
With a little forethought and customizing, you
can use Microsoft CRM to ensure that you keep
the customers you already have. CRM vendors
have put little emphasis on customer retention,
but it is relatively simple and will provide that
return on your investment that everyone looks
forward to generating.

Deciding Whether Microsoft 
CRM Fits Your Needs
Microsoft CRM is not for everyone, but it’s inevitable that an enormous wave
of companies will adopt it. It will probably achieve a critical mass, much like
other Microsoft applications, and may eventually become the de facto stan-
dard for CRM.
Microsoft has targeted Outlook users. If you’re comfortably using Outlook to
maintain your list of contacts and to handle your e-mail, you should become
a satisfied user of Microsoft CRM. The look and feel of Outlook has been trans-
ferred into the Outlook version of Microsoft CRM. And Microsoft has provided
an import facility for transferring your Outlook data into Microsoft CRM.
If you are coming from one of the enterprise-level CRM systems, such as Siebel
or Oracle, you will be impressed with the relative ease and user-friendliness
of Microsoft CRM — as well as the ability for Microsoft CRM to adapt to the
way you do business as opposed to the other way around.
If you are a salesperson who operates more on your own than as a member
of a team, you will be right at home. The security built into the system will
provide you with a sense of well-being, and you’ll have just enough ability
to coordinate activities with other members of your team when you are 
compelled to do so.
On the other hand, if your experience is with another CRM package (such as
ACT or GoldMine) that was built for small to medium-sized businesses, you
are about to enter a new world. Your first issue will be getting your existing
data into Microsoft CRM, which is no easy task. See Chapter 28 for a discus-
sion of third-party add-ons that address this problem.
Some of the basic calendar and literature management functionality that you
are accustomed to are just plain missing. If you are used to looking up other
people’s schedules, you will need to learn a new way of handling this.
If you have five or fewer people using the system, you’ll probably find that
setting up CRM is too expensive and technology-intensive. Enter Business
Contact Manager, which Microsoft makes available for free for up to five
users of Outlook 2003. Microsoft CRM will automatically import all data into
Microsoft CRM when you grow into it.
16
Part I: Microsoft CRM Basics 

Using Microsoft CRM Successfully
The difference between a successful implementation and a flop is often the
investment of a little more time, thought, money, and commitment. Microsoft
CRM won’t let you down as long as you do the following:
 Have a needs analysis completed by a competent dealer. Spend the
money. It’s well worth it.
 Make sure that every user finds an advantage to using the system.
Otherwise, you won’t get good acceptance or consistent use, which will
inevitably lead to the collapse of the system. You have to sell your team
on it. Solicit ideas from team members. Have each of them invest in the
effort.
 Plan your technology infrastructure. Microsoft CRM demands a series
of servers (or at least a Small Business server) and good network con-
nectivity. You may need to update your operating systems and install
SQL and Exchange Servers.
 Organize your existing data. You probably have your data in more
places and formats than you realize. Take a survey of all your users so
you know the location of all the data. Plan to eliminate unnecessary
records and collect as much missing information as possible.
 Install your Microsoft CRM software and customize it with regard to
any additional fields and reports you need.
 Set up your organizational structure with business units, roles, and
teams.
 Import all the data and train your users almost simultaneously. As soon
as training is complete, you want your users to have immediate access
to their own data so they can start using it before they forget what they
learned in class.
 Don’t take your eyes off your data. As soon as you turn your back on
the data, it will turn into garbage. Put someone in charge of data
integrity.
 Plan to continually improve the system. The system will never be fin-
ished and will never be perfect. It’s a process that evolves and changes
as your organization changes. Don’t lose sight of where you came from.

emember the home page in CRM Versions 1 and 1.2? Well, the home
page is gone, and its functions have been blended into what Microsoft
calls the workplace. In this chapter, we explain the main features of the work-
place screen and the other common screens and provide you with the skills
to get from one screen to another without getting lost.
Whirlwind Tour of the Screen
The workplace is the first thing you see when you start Microsoft CRM, so that’s
where we’ll begin our discussion of what’s what on the screen. Figure 2-1 shows
a typical workplace screen.
Many elements in CRM are context sensitive, which means that what they
contain differs depending on what part of the program you’re viewing, what
access rights you have, or both. In addition, you can change your personal
settings (as described in Chapter 4). Those personal settings may further
influence what you see on each screen. And, one more caveat: Microsoft CRM

is highly customizable. If someone in your organization or your CRM dealer
has already customized your system, your screens may not be exactly the
same as those that came out of the box. (For this book, we used all out-of-the-
box screens.)
If you’ve used Microsoft products before, you’ll find that some of these ele-
ments are familiar. Let’s start from the top.
Menu bar
The menu bar, which appears below the title bar, is context sensitive, which
means that the choices you have depend on the screen you are logged on to
(such as Accounts or Activities) and the access rights you have. On the far
right of the menu bar is the name of the currently logged-in user. Typically,
that will be you.

Part I: Microsoft CRM Basics 

Toolbar
Next up after the menu bar is the toolbar. This area contains buttons for
common tasks. For example, in the Activities window (refer to Figure 2-1), the
first few toolbar buttons (from left to right) are used to create a task, fax,
phone call, e-mail, and letter. The New Record button on the toolbar leads to
a screen where you can create each of the different types of records. Use the
Advanced Find button to quickly search for a set of records based on one or
more fields that the program has defined as searchable. The results of the
Advanced Find operation are shown in the listing in the middle of the
window.
Navigation pane
The navigation pane is the column on the left side of the screen. As men-
tioned, many screen elements are context sensitive, but no area is more so
than the navigation pane. The navigation pane is split into two major areas.
What button you click at the bottom — Workplace, Sales, Marketing, Service,
or Settings — determines what you see at the top. Click Sales, for example,
and you might see a screen like the one in Figure 2-2.
Figure 2-2:
Clicking the
Sales button
displays a
list of your
current
leads.
21
Chapter 2: Navigating the Microsoft CRM System

When you are using one of the modules, the navigation pane is always avail-
able, and you can use it to get back to the workplace at any time. For those
people just getting started with a CRM application or those coming from a
simpler system, it’s easy to get lost in what may seem to be a myriad of simi-
lar screens. The Workplace button in the navigation pane is always there for
you, like a trail of bread crumbs leading you home.
If you’re suddenly lost while entering information, remember that Microsoft
CRM does not automatically save data for you. So click the Save button (the
disk icon) on the toolbar before returning to the workplace.
Status bar
At the very bottom of the screen is the status bar with several indicators.
The Done indicator tells you that CRM has finished retrieving the information
you requested. If CRM has not finished, you see an indication of what it is cur-
rently loading. If you see a pop-up icon in the status bar, hover your mouse
over it and it will tell you whether pop-ups are blocked. The final indicator
shows your current Internet security properties. The possibilities are Internet,
Local Intranet, Trusted Sites, and Restricted Sites.
Window
The largest part of the screen is what we simply call the window (labeled
in Figure 2-1). What you see here depends first on what navigation button
you’ve clicked (Workplace, Sales, Marketing, Service, or Settings) and
second on what you’ve clicked in the upper part of the navigation pane.
For example, in Figure 2-3, we’ve clicked Workplace and then Accounts
(under Customers).
At the top of the window is the name of the area you’re currently working in.
Directly below the title of the window you see the Look For field and its Find
button as well as the View menu. You use these elements to filter records.
We talk more about filtering records later in this chapter.
Next up is a row of toolbar buttons, such as the New button and a printer
icon. The toolbar in Figure 2-3 also shows two buttons with drop-down
menus, Create Quick Campaign and More Actions. Click the down-pointing
arrow, and a list of options appears.
Records are displayed in the main display area of the window. You can view
any record that appears here by simply clicking it. To preview additional
22
Part I: Microsoft CRM Basics 

details about a record displayed in the window, click the arrow to the left of
the record name. A small window, called the preview, appears in the lower
part of the screen with more fields than can be seen in the listing in the main
window. However, you can’t edit a record in the preview window.
At the top of the record listing are the column headers. Click a column header
to sort the records into ascending or descending order. To change the sort
order, click the column header again.
To select one or more records for some type of action, such as sending an
e-mail, highlight the record. You can select all the records on a page by click-
ing the top check box (the one that is a column header).
Selecting all the records in the manner just described selects only those
records displayed in that particular window, one screen at a time.

any windows, particularly those with a list view such as the Accounts
window, have a refresh button just to the right of the column headers
(labeled in Figure 2-3). If you’ve modified a record but there’s no evidence
of that change in the window, click the refresh button.
Several elements appear at the bottom of the window. The first is the scroll
bar. Next, you see a row indicating how may records appear in the window.
The current page is on the far right. When a listing has more than one page,
the arrows surrounding the page number are no longer dimmed and you can
use them to move from one page to another.
The final element in the window is the CRM alphabet bar. Click a letter in the
alphabet bar, and you see only records beginning with that letter. This is a
quick way to sort and find records.
First Things First — Signing On
Now that we’ve described some of the basic screen terminology, it’s time to
talk about navigating through the CRM system. But before you can navigate
to and through Microsoft CRM, you have to sign on. Although that sounds
like a simple thing, you might encounter a gotcha or two.
Microsoft CRM does not require a separate login for the program like other
CRM systems you may have used. It is integrated with Microsoft Active
Directory, which means that it gets your login information from your com-
puter. However, before you can access CRM, your administrator must set you
up in the system with at least one security role. Your role in the organization
and your access rights will determine, to a large part, what sections of the
system you can get to and what you can do when you’re there. For more on
roles and access rights, see Chapter 5.
Microsoft CRM is normally an intranet-based application, so you access the
application from your web browser. Therefore, the application is hosted on
your servers, generally with none of the information accessible from the
Internet — unless you set it up that way. To use the system from your com-
puter through the Internet — the higher the speed, the better. A dial-up line
might work, but you won’t be a happy camper over the long run. DSL, cable,
or a T1 line are all better options.
If your browser has a pop-up blocker enabled, this may prevent you from
even getting into Microsoft CRM. From the Internet Explorer main toolbar, go
to Tools➪Pop-up Blocker➪Turn off Pop-up Blocker. However, this may not be
enough if you have other pop-up blockers enabled. For example, if you use
Yahoo!, it has its own pop-up blocker (on its main toolbar) that must also be
disabled.
24
Part I: Microsoft CRM Basics 

The Workplace Is Your Starting Point
When you have conquered the mysteries of Internet connectivity and pop-up
blockers, you will land on the sign-on screen. After you enter your username
and password and click OK, CRM automatically brings you to your workplace.
The workplace is not only the first place you see after signing on, it’s the place
you should always go back to if you find yourself adrift in a sea of screens.
The CRM program contains five modules: workplace, sales, marketing, ser-
vice, and settings. The three application modules — sales, marketing, and
service — can contain many individual records, such as an account or a 
contact or a case. In this section, we discuss how to get to the application
modules and, from there, how to get to individual records.
Navigating at the application level
You can navigate to the three application modules from the workplace in two
ways: the navigation pane or the Go To menu (on the menu bar). Our choice
is to use the navigation pane, which contains buttons for all five modules
(including the workplace itself). If you instead choose the Go To menu, you
are presented with a drop-down list of the same five choices available in the
navigation pane.
The settings module is one you will visit infrequently, when you want to change
a personal setting on your system. That leaves the three application modules:
sales, marketing, and service. Depending on your role in your organization,
you’ll probably be spending most of your day in just one of these modules.
At the application level, the windows you see are similar to those of the work-
place, but they do have a few differences. Figure 2-4 shows a sample window
with a listing of contacts.
Navigating at the record level
From the application level, you can drill down to the record level, where the
meat of your data actually lives. Figure 2-5 shows a typical contact record.
The record level shows detailed information about each subarea (Contacts,
Leads, Opportunities, Accounts, and the like). To access the record level, you
simply double-click a record in the particular window’s listing.

Your first navigation lessons
Navigating through the Activities window is typical of more general navigation
through CRM. You will almost always need to create and edit appointments
(which are a type of activity), so we’ll use appointments as an example.
You can create (also called schedule) an activity in many ways, but the
fastest and easiest way is to use the workplace:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Workplace button.
2. At the top of the navigation pane, click Activities.
The Activities window appears.
3. In the Activities window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The New Activity dialog box appears.
4. Double-click the icon for the activity you want to create.
You’re creating an appointment, so you would double-click Appointment.
A window appears for entering the relevant information, as shown in
Figure 2-6.
Figure 2-6:
Scheduling
an appoint-
ment.
27
Chapter 2: Navigating the Microsoft CRM System

5. Enter text in all the necessary fields.
For an appointment, you’d enter the subject (why you’re making the
appointment), the account or contact with whom you’re scheduling the
appointment, and all scheduling information.
6. CRM doesn’t save anything until you tell it to, so click the Save and
Close button (below the menu bar).
You return to the workplace.
Now that you’ve created an appointment, you can practice changing one.
This should be even easier. We’ll start from the Activities window:
1. In the Activities window, find and then click the activity you want
to edit.
The activity opens, enabling you to review and change it. If you were
changing an appointment, you’d see a screen similar to Figure 2-6.
2. To change a field, highlight it and make your edits.
For example, you might want to change the scheduled time for an
appointment.
3. Before leaving the window, make sure you click the Save and Close
button.
You return to the workplace.
Now that you’ve worked on creating, viewing, and editing an appointment,
let’s take a moment to check out another area of CRM: announcements.
From the workplace, click Announcements (under My Work) in the upper
part of the navigation pane. In the Announcements window, members of your
team can post messages to everyone about company-wide events or issues.
For example, you might use an announcement to send reminders about an
upcoming price change or a revised holiday schedule.
Figure 2-7 shows some typical announcement postings. Clicking the link in
the Announcements window brings you directly to that posting. The posting
will include a link to a web site containing additional information, if that link
was created when the announcement was created.
If an announcement is too long, or if several active announcements are dis-
played, a scroll bar appears at the right side of the window so you can review
all the posted material.

Part I: Microsoft CRM Basics 

Filtering and Searching for Records
Since the dawn of mankind, humans have organized things. Of course, if you
organize things, you have to filter and search through them at some point. It
could be argued that you have to filter and search before you can organize,
but that’s sort of like trying to determine which came first, the chicken or the
egg. Well, Microsoft CRM doesn’t answer that question, but the program does
offer you an advanced, user-intuitive filter and search capability.
Filtering records
Now how is filtering different from searching? Basically, a filter is a type of
search, in that you give the program search criteria and the filter function
hunts down all the records that meet your search definition. You can apply
this filtering to a list of contacts or leads, to documents in the knowledge
base, to service activities, and more. You can use the function to find one
record or a thousand records.
Figure 2-7:
A typical
company
announce-
ment
window.
29
Chapter 2: Navigating the Microsoft CRM System

In almost every workspace in Microsoft CRM, you’ll see a Look For field and a
View field, as shown in Figure 2-8.
You use the Look For field to enter information free form. If you’re looking for
an article on brakes, for example, you could type brakes. If you’re looking
for the guy who just called you at the help desk (and got cut off) but all you
remember is his first name, Rico, you could type that first name.
Right next to the Look For field is the View field. Basically, this tells the pro-
gram where to search for and what to search while hunting for the text you
entered in the Look For field.
Here’s where the filter function shows its teeth. The options you find in the
View field drop-down box depend on what section of Microsoft CRM you’re
working in. For example, if you’re in Workplace, under Contacts, the options
are geared towards contacts, such as Active Contacts, My Active Contacts,
and Inactive Contacts. If you’re in Marketing, in the Campaigns workspace,
you get options such as My Campaigns and Launched Campaigns.
Searching with the magnifying glass icon
Throughout Microsoft CRM, you’ll find a magnifying-glass icon to the right of
many fields. Whenever you see the magnifying glass, there’s a Look Up Records
dialog box waiting for you. Using this look-up feature, you can search almost
anything.
Just click the magnifying glass. Like the filter function, the options you see in
the Look Up dialog box depend on the field the icon is next to. Figure 2-9 is
the one you’ll see most often because it lends itself to most searches per-
formed in Microsoft CRM. The drop-down box offered in the Look For field
can have two options to search in (say, Accounts and Contacts) or as many
as eleven, depending on the type of record you’re looking for.

When you’re offered to choose more than one option, the window in
Figure 2-11 lets you choose which options you want. After you find them in
the left pane, just click the double right-arrow to move them over to the
Selected Records pane.
Figure 2-12 is the Look Up window you see when you click the magnifying
glass next to a Subject field.

Searching with the Form Assistant
The Form Assistant is basically the lookup records feature put right there on
the same window you’re working in. Every field with a magnifying glass can
be accessed and completed using the Form Assistant. See Figure 2-13.
Keep in mind that what the Form Assistant shows depends on the field you
want to complete.
Searching with the Advanced Find Feature
Almost all CRM software programs have some sort of advanced search fea-
ture, but they rarely measure up to the workhorse built into Microsoft CRM.
You can search for almost anything, from addresses to queues to roles to
views. The other cool thing is that Advanced Find is accessible throughout
the program (in the main menu bar).
Figure 2-13:

33
Chapter 2: Navigating the Microsoft CRM System

In this section, we look at using the Advanced Find feature. (You can find
even more ways to use Advanced Find in Chapter 16.) Follow these steps:
1. Click the Advanced Find button in the main toolbar, or choose
Tools➪Advanced Find in the menu bar.
Your location in the program doesn’t matter. You can access Advanced
Find from Marketing, Sales, Service — even Settings. The Advanced Find
dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-14, so you can define the values
of your search.
2. Click the drop-down arrow to the right of the Look For field to select
the area or item you want to search.
The list has 49 items (or more if you have customized field views).
Browse through them to see the available options. The options in the
Use Saved View field depend on the category you select in the Look For
field. Experiment by selecting various options in the Look For field and
then seeing your options in the Use Saved View field.
3. Choose your search criteria.
a. Move your cursor to the word Select below the window’s toolbar
in the Advanced Find window.
A field appears with a drop-down menu.
Figure 2-14:
With
Advanced
Find, your
search
options are
almost

34
Part I: Microsoft CRM Basics 

b. Click the field to open the drop-down box.
c. Select a field from the drop-down menu.
This tells Microsoft CRM that the search you’re about to conduct
will look first in the State/Province field.
Note that after you make the State/Province selection, the word Equals
appears next to it. To the right of Equals is the phrase Enter Value. The
options in this third lookup file depend on the choices made earlier.
4. Choose the modifier.
a. Hover your cursor over the word Equals to display the field.
This should default to Equals, but always check before continuing.
We want Equals in this case, but you also have Does Not Equal,
Contains, Does Not Contain, and so on.
b. Click in the field to open the drop-down box and select the
option you need.
5. Enter the value for your search to look for.
a. Move your cursor over the words Enter Value, and click in the
field that appears.
Again, these options depend on choices made in the previous steps.
b. To follow along with the example, enter NY;NJ in the field.
By using the semicolon, you can define multiple possible values for
this field.
6. Click Save.
A window pops up, asking for a title of your search.
7. Enter a name for your search and click OK.
This convenient feature saves your search for future use.
Click the arrow by the Use Saved View field to see all saved searches.
Searches in System Views are available to everyone. Those in My Views
(including the one you just saved) are available to you.
8. In the Advanced Find window, click Find (in the lower-right corner) to
activate the search.
A new window appears showing you a list of all accounts meeting your
search criteria, as shown in Figure 2-15.
Didn’t see what you wanted? Or worse, your search results returned a gazil-
lion more hits than you thought it would? You can always click Back to Query
to return to your search criteria for further definition.

Using Microsoft CRM 
Online and Offline
In This Chapter
 Outlining the things the Outlook client can’t do
 Understanding the Outlook client
 Synchronizing
 Setting up your workspace in the Outlook client
You can use Microsoft CRM in two ways: through the browser (the web
client) or through Microsoft Outlook (the Microsoft CRM for Outlook
client — which we call the outlook client). The web client is your main access
method, the one that everyone in the office will use. The Outlook client is
what your traveling folks use as well as the members of your staff who have
no life and take their computers home to work from there.
The Microsoft CRM Outlook client has two options for your business: the
laptop client, which allows for synchronization, and the desktop client, which
is designed not to have a local database. If you are security conscious about
data leaving your building or you always work at a desk, the desktop client
may be your best option. If you spend most of your life on the road, you may
want to use the laptop client because it allows you to make changes while not
connected to any networks.
We’re basing this chapter on the assumption that you already know Microsoft
Outlook, so we don’t go over Microsoft Outlook itself in detail. What we do
focus on are the two different environments. Despite some functionality issues,
how you do Microsoft CRM things in the Outlook client is almost exactly how
you would do them in Microsoft CRM’s web client.

Functionality
We start with those functionality issues just mentioned. Although you can do
tons of stuff from the Outlook client, it can’t do a handful of functions from
Microsoft CRM. This includes settings as well as administrative and some
customer support functions. We’ve listed them here:
 Settings
• Change settings
• Administer system
• Configure system 
 Customer service functions
• Manage knowledge base 
• Manage service activities
• Manage services
• View Microsoft CRM service calendar
• Edit products
• Edit or manage sales literature
On the flip side, there are a few things you can do from the Outlook client
that you can’t do from the web client, such as a letter merge.
Last but not least, some things are particular to Outlook and are not incorpo-
rated into the Outlook client. For example, attachments might not be accepted
in templates. Also, you can’t use a drag-and-drop operation to move or copy an
Outlook contact into a Microsoft CRM folder. (If you drag a contact to a folder,
you create a new e-mail message, but the contact information is not copied.)
When you create an Outlook contact, be sure to click Track in CRM so that
the new contact record syncs to your web client.
If you drag an Outlook e-mail message into a Microsoft CRM folder, the mes-
sage will not appear in the Microsoft CRM folder even though it has been
moved or copied to the folder.
The Outlook Client
When you’re ready to start working, just launch Outlook. Easy as pie. With
Microsoft CRM on your system, the Outlook client is automatically activated
in Outlook itself. At this point, you’re in the Outlook client, working online.
Take a look at Figure 3-1.
38
Part I: Microsoft CRM Basics 

Microsoft Outlook itself offers the ability to work online or offline. You can still
use the Outlook client, no matter how you’re working in Outlook. Another
thing to keep in mind is that when you go offline (or come back online), the
Outlook client automatically synchronizes with the main database.
Using Microsoft CRM functions
You can access Microsoft CRM functions in three ways. The first is by using
the leftmost navigation pane, which has a Microsoft CRM section. If you open
the folders and subfolders in this section, you’ll see that most of the options
in the web client are also here.
We mentioned that doing Microsoft CRM tasks in the Outlook client is almost
the same as doing them in the web client. Let’s take a quick peek at sales con-
tacts, so you can see that we weren’t kidding!
1. Under Microsoft CRM in the navigation pane, click the plus sign next
to Sales.
If a minus sign appears next to Sales instead, there’s no need to click,
because the Sales folder is already displaying its subfolders.
2. Select Contacts (under Sales).
Now take a look at the right pane, the main workspace (see Figure 3-2).
Look familiar? This is almost exactly like the workspace you would see
in the Microsoft CRM web client.
Figure 3-1:
This is how
Microsoft
Outlook
appears
with the
Outlook
client active.
39
Chapter 3: Using Microsoft CRM Online and Offline

The other two methods of accessing CRM functions are by choosing the CRM
option on the menu bar and clicking the CRM button in the toolbar. The navi-
gation, options, and functionality offered by both choices are identical to the
web client. And because we covering those elsewhere in the book, we only
mention a few important ones here.
Outlook client mail merge
As any sales rep or marketing guru can tell you, mail merge is one of the best
inventions since peanut butter. You can mail merge a document (and envelopes
or labels!) to a group of contacts or accounts, so that printing and setting up
mailings is a snap. This is one of the few features not found in the web client.
1. While you’re in Outlook with the Outlook client, use the navigation pane
to go to and highlight the group to which you want to send the letter.
Let’s say you’re moving the office and need to let your customers know.
You would navigate to Sales and then Accounts. In the Sales window,
select the view that contains your customers. The workspace on the
right looks just like the workspace for Marketing: Accounts in Microsoft
CRM (the web client), complete with the same toolbar.
2. In the Accounts window toolbar, click the arrow on the More Actions
button and then choose Mail Merge.
The Mail Merge dialog box appears.
Figure 3-2:
Just like the
real thing.
40
Part I: Microsoft CRM Basics 

3. Select Template Letter, and then click OK.
The browse window appears.
4. Search for and highlight the document you want to merge to the
groups. Then click OK.
A list of mail merge recipients appears.
5. Highlight the recipients you want to send your letter to, and then
click OK.
6. On the right side of your screen in Word, select Next to preview your
document.
7. Click Next again to complete the merge.
8. Select Print. 
Outlook client e-mail
Only a few differences exist between Outlook client e-mail and web client
e-mail, mostly in how you get that e-mail recorded into your Microsoft CRM
later. For the most part, sending an e-mail using the Outlook client is just like
sending one in Outlook, only better. Read on:
1. In the Outlook toolbar, choose New➪Mail Message.
Your new e-mail window appears (it’s untitled, simply because you
haven’t put anything in the subject line yet). Eyes up: Just under the
main menu bar is a new toolbar, as shown in Figure 3-3.
Figure 3-3:
Can you
spot the
additions to
the Outlook
client
e-mail?
41
Chapter 3: Using Microsoft CRM Online and Offline

2. In that toolbar, click the Track in CRM button.
Basically, you’re telling the Outlook client to attach this e-mail to one of
CRM’s business objects, such as contacts, accounts, opportunities, or
cases.
3. In the same toolbar, click the Regarding button or the magnifying glass.
This is where you can associate the e-mail to the appropriate Microsoft
CRM record. Either option opens the Look Up Records dialog box, as
shown in Figure 3-4. (You use this dialog box in later chapters too.)
4. Click the arrow in the Look For field and select the type of record you
want to associate with this e-mail.
You can search for the record by entering a search term in the empty
box next to the Find button and then clicking Find. Because the records
are in alphabetical order, you can also page to the entry. The results of
your search appear in the Look Up Records window.
5. Highlight the record you want and then click OK.
You return to the new e-mail window. Take a look at the Regarding
button. It should now read Regarding and whatever client or account
you selected.
6. Complete your e-mail message as you normally would in Outlook, and
then send it.
The message is now sent and is also tied to the item you selected in the
Regarding area. If you were to open that object up and look under History,
you would see this e-mail.
Figure 3-4:

Part I: Microsoft CRM Basics 

If you get stuck and need help with Microsoft CRM while you’re in the Outlook
client, choose CRM➪Help on the menu bar in your Outlook window. Outlook’s
Help files don’t contain anything about Microsoft CRM.
Synchronization Settings
No, we’re not talking about synchronizing our watches, like a certain spy who
has now gone blond. (I still say long live the Scot!) We’re talking about getting
all the offline work you did at home last night into the office and into
Microsoft CRM.
The Outlook client has two types of synchronization: server synchronization
and Outlook synchronization. (Microsoft CRM syncs directly to Outlook.)
To set up the information available to you in Outlook, you need to tell CRM
what data to sync. Here’s how:
1. On the Outlook client’s menu bar, choose CRM➪Options.
Your Set Personal Options dialog box appears, with three tabs: General,
Synchronization, and Workplace.
2. Click the Synchronization tab.
The screen is divided into two parts: basically, what to synchronize and
when to synchronize.
3. Choose what you want to synchronize.
There are three options for the different types of data that will sync:
appointments, contacts, and tasks. We recommend that you check them
all, just to save you a few steps later.
4. Choose when to synchronize.
Check the box and then fill in the minutes field with however long you
want the system to sync. You can also turn off automatic synchronization
by unchecking this box. Take note here: the minimum auto sync time
that you can set is 15 minutes.
Your other option is to set up the system so it automatically syncs your
Outlook folder when you start your computer.
5. Click OK to save your settings.
The Set Personal Options dialog box closes, and you return to the
Outlook client window.
43
Chapter 3: Using Microsoft CRM Online and Offline

Synchronizing the Outlook client 
with your server
Outlook client and server synchronization can really be broken down to the
idea that you have data flowing in two directions: From your server (office) to
your Outlook client (laptop) and then from your Outlook client to your server.
The very first step is to set up Microsoft CRM on your laptop with the Outlook
client and copy over the data that you’ll need when you’re working offline.
We recommend that you find your IT guys (they’re like pens — you can never
find one when you need one) and get them to do this part. It could take some
time, so be prepared to surrender your laptop to your IT department for this
initial setup. Yes, we understand your difficulties in surrendering your laptop,
but chin up, little camper. You will survive (plus, for the most part, this is the
only time you’ll have to give up your laptop to get it ready for sync).
Let’s fast-forward a bit. You have your laptop back (and figured out the pass-
word that the IT department changed on you as a joke). You took the laptop
home and promptly got to work. You worked, played solitaire, chatted with a
friend, worked some more, explained to your son that the dog doesn’t know
how to play ninja warriors, and worked some more . . . until, finally, you’re ready
to sync. Going offline (and coming back online) is easy. Within your Outlook
client, choose File➪Work Offline. When you switch to Work Offline, this option
will be checked. Click it again to work online (the check will be removed).
If you have a lot of data, synchronization might take awhile. To check the
progress, choose CRM➪Synchronization Progress. The Synchronizing
Microsoft CRM Data dialog box appears. You get a comprehensive view of
just how your sync is progressing and will be alerted to any errors that occur
during the process.
Setting data group (sync) filters
So just how many records (contacts, accounts, and all) do you have in your
database? Some companies can have in excess of 40,000. Now let’s say that
you’re the sales rep for Virginia and only 1,000 of those clients are yours.
You don’t want anyone else’s clients; you just want yours. The best thing to
do is set a data group filter so that only your contacts come over to your laptop.
A data group filter tells the system what records to include. It is similar to the
Advanced Find function and report filters (see Chapters 2 and 11, respectively,
for information on these).
44
Part I: Microsoft CRM Basics 

In a data group filter, you can choose from two filter modes: simple and detailed.
The simple filter mode lets you change the values to include. The detailed mode
lets you add criteria to your rule and gives you access to the Filter toolbar.
We recommend that you write your complex filter expressions on paper first.
This way, you can make sure you don’t forget some little line or symbol when
you enter it in the data group filter.
Here’s how you set those data group filters from the Outlook client:
1. On the menu bar, choose CRM➪Local Data.
The Local Data dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-5.
2. Choose the New button to start a new data group filter.
The Data Group dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-6, so you can
set up your criteria. You can also edit your data groups from here, but
for now, we show you how to create one. Note the button below the Look
For field. If the screen is in Show Details mode — as it is in Figure 3-6 and
should be for these steps — the button reads Hide Details. Click it to
hide the details and the button changes to Show Details.
Figure 3-5:
All your data

Chapter 3: Using Microsoft CRM Online and Offline

3. Choose the field on which you want to base your filter.
Move your cursor to the word Select to display the search field. Click it
to open the drop-down box. Scroll until you can select the field on which
you want to base your filter. For this exercise, we selected Owner.
4. Choose your qualifier.
Move your cursor over the word Equals to display the field, and then
click it to open the drop-down box. The choices depend on what you
chose in Step 3. For our example, we’re going to use the default, Equals.
5. Where the word Enter appears, select or enter your search criteria.
Depending on what you chose in Steps 3 and 4, this field will be either a
free-form field, in which you can manually enter data, or be accompa-
nied by a magnifying glass, which you click to make your choices in the
Look Up Records dialog box. After you’ve entered your data, another
Select line appears.
6. If you want to enter additional search criteria, repeat Steps 3–5 to add
additional search criteria.
7. In the toolbar, click the Save button.
A Data Group Properties dialog box appears.

8. Name this data group, add a description if you want, and then click OK.
You return to the Data Group dialog box. The Name field at the top of the
window now contains the group name. You can close this window now if
you want. You’ll go back to the Local Data dialog box, where your data
group appears in the list.
All right, now that you’ve created a data group, let’s go back and edit it. Suppose
you want to choose the records owned by Bob, the sales guy, and Stanley, the
other sales guy. Basically, you would repeat Steps 3–5 twice: once to choose
Bob and once to choose Stanley. Select them both by holding down the Ctrl key
and clicking each criteria. Next, choose between Group AND and Group OR.
Group AND tells the filter to search records that contain both or all criteria.
If you click Group AND, it will search for records containing both Bob AND
Stanley, and because a record can’t have two owners, your search results
turn up zilch.
Group OR tells the filter to search for records with either Bob OR Stanley as
the owner. In this case, this is your best way to go.
Grouping filter criteria works only if you’re using criteria of the same type.
For instance, the previous example works because you’re searching for two
owners. However, if you were searching for, say, owner and zip code, you
could not group those.
The “last one in” rule
Last one in, close the door, right? According to your mother, maybe, but
Microsoft CRM looks at “last one in” a little differently. The last one in rule
concerns what happens when two or more people sync changes to the server
for the same contact or account.
Let’s hop into our time machine to explain a perfect scenario for the “last one
in” rule. Last night, you went offline at 5 to meet a client (Ms. Joanne Powers)
for dinner at the local greasy spoon. She introduces herself as Joan, not Joanne,
so you make a mental note to correct that in your database when you get
home. Fast-forward to after dinner, back at your house. Like all of us tech
junkies, you go straight to your laptop and change her name and then go on
to check your e-mail. But you forget to sync with the office.
Now, this morning, you have to go clear across the state to meet up with
another client. You got up late, didn’t have time to sync with the office, and
ran out the door.
47
Chapter 3: Using Microsoft CRM Online and Offline

Meanwhile, your trusty sales assistant has come into the office, and she goes
to check Ms. Powers’s record in Microsoft CRM, using the web client. She thinks
Ms. Powers is Jo-Anne (remember, your assistant still sees Joanne) so she
changes Joanne to Jo-Anne.
You finally get back to the office around 3 p.m. and power up your laptop and
the Outlook client, go online, and sync. Now take a look at Ms. Powers’s record:
It should say Joanne (and not Joan or Jo-Anne). Even though you made your
change last night and your assistant made hers this morning, your data was
the last (or most recent) data received and therefore is the one the web client
listens to.
What if your trusty (and underpaid) sales assistant changed Ms. Powers’s last
name to Powhers? Both changes would be kept because you’re not messing
with the same piece of data.
Setting Up the Outlook Client Workplace
Setting up your Outlook client navigation pane and workplace is easy and can
be accomplished with just a few clicks. The defaults options are the My Work
and Customers options. Here’s how you can change these to display the areas
you want to work on:
1. On the Outlook client’s menu bar, choose CRM➪Options.
The Set Personal Options dialog box appears.
2. Click the Workplace tab.
The tab has two sides: Preview on the left and Set Workplace Area on
the right.
3. Check the options you want.
The Preview pane displays the work available under each option.
You can check two or even all three.
4. Click OK to close the dialog box and go back to the Outlook client.
As you can see, the Outlook client makes it easy to work offline and away from
the office. This could save valuable time and expenses and makes things flow
just a little smoother, which is the overall goal for Microsoft CRM.
In the following chapters, you find out how to use Microsoft CRM’s web client
for e-mail, marketing, and service work.

n Part II, you discover how to make the software fit you
and your organization. You read about personalizing
the system around your own work habits and schedule.
You find out about security and access rights, territories,
roles, and business units. 
Because workflow is a key component to automating the
system around your company’s business processes,
Chapters 7 and 8 discuss designing and then implement-
ing workflow.
A knowledge base is a collection of articles, materials, and
responses to inquiries thats a valuable tool for everyone
in your organization. A knowledge base is particularly
helpful to new members, who may not know quite as
much as you do about the organization and its products,
services, and policies. Developing a knowledge base is dis-
cussed in Chapter 9. In Chapter 10, you find out how to set
up a catalog of products and services you sell.
With Microsoft CRM, you can use built-in reports or create
your own. In Chapters 11 and 12, you find out how to run
those reports and how to develop template documents
and internal announcements.

Chapter 4
Personalizing Your System
In This Chapter
 Accessing your personal settings
 Understanding your user profile options
O
ne of the first things you should do is set your personal options to con-
trol the way Microsoft CRM displays information. You can use these 
personal settings to streamline the system so it best suits your function
in the organization and your style. For example, you can determine what
window appears when you start Microsoft CRM each day. If your role is
strictly in customer service, you might want the system to go directly to
the listing of your cases.
In this chapter, we discuss what choices you have and how to set them.
It’s unlikely that you will need to change every option, but it’s good to
know what’s available.
Customization is important, and the process shouldn’t take long. A little
attention to customization now will enable you to work more efficiently as
you become familiar with the system.
Tailoring the System to Suit Your Needs
You can streamline your use of CRM by setting your regular workday hours,
how you want your scheduled activities to appear, and the starting point for
the system each morning, and many other options. Options like these are
called your personal settings. Basically, you are telling Microsoft CRM how
you like to operate.
To access your personal settings, follow these two steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Workplace button.
An option to Personalize Workplace appears in blue just above the
Workplace button.

2. Click the Personalize Workplace option.
The Set Personal Options window appears, with the Workplace tab dis-
played by default, as shown in Figure 4-1.
CRM provides you with four tabs, each of which affects various default set-
tings and how information is displayed. None of these settings affect anyone
other than you, so you should set them to please yourself.
General tab
The General tab (called Miscellaneous in prior versions of Microsoft CRM)
contains settings for what you want the system to display upon startup, how
many records you want to see at one time, how you want the Find function to
work, and what time zone you work in. The General tab is shown in Figure 4-2.
The first group of options on the General tab pertains to your default start
page. The Default Pane field has five choices, but you can probably eliminate
Settings as a reasonable choice. Selecting Settings means every morning
when you sign on, CRM will automatically start up by allowing you to change
your Settings. This isn’t something you’re likely to do regularly. In fact, you’ll
probably set it and forget it.
If your job function is primarily in sales, marketing, or customer service, it
might seem logical to select one of those choices as a starting point for your
day. This might work for you. However, we prefer to come in each morning and

Part II: Setting the Settings 

see what’s on our agenda. This is best accomplished by setting the Default Pane
option to Workplace and the Default Tab option to Activities or to Calendar.
(Note that the selections you see in the Default Tab option change depending
on your selection in the Default Pane option.)
To set your default start screen, follow these steps:
1. Set the Default Pane option as desired.
To do so, click the down arrow to the right of the field and then make a
selection. The options in the Default Tab option will change, but you
won’t be able to see that until you position your mouse in that field.
2. Set the Default Tab option as desired.
3. Click the OK button (at the bottom of the window).
Your new options are saved, but you will not see the effect of this until
the next time you log into CRM.
Now on to the next option on the General tab — the number of records shown
on the page. Depending on the size and resolution of the screen you’re using,
you may want to change the number of records that appear in each list. The
smaller your screen or the lower your resolution, the fewer lines you may want
displayed at any one time. On the other hand, if you have a large number of
records and prefer just scrolling up and down, set the number of records shown
to a large number, perhaps 100 or more. The default is 25 records per page;
we usually set ours a little higher.

Chapter 4: Personalizing Your System

Advanced Find Mode, a new feature in Version 3, allows you to create more
complex searches and save search criteria for future use. You can take best
advantage of this feature by selecting the Detailed option. If you select the
Simple mode instead, you can use predefined searches but cannot create new
ones yourself. Even if you have no intention of creating Advanced Find searches
right now, don’t limit yourself by selecting Simple.
The Time Zone drop-down list contains time zones from all over the world.
Choose yours. The goal of setting your time zone is to coordinate your activi-
ties with other members of your team who may be dispersed throughout the
world. This will assist in coordinating conference calls among team members.
For example, suppose you are in New York and set up a conference call with a
team member in Sydney, Australia. If you schedule your call for 4 p.m. Monday,
the call will show up on your Australian counterpart’s activity list for 8 a.m.
Tuesday (her time).
In the General tab, and in the other three tabs as well, make sure to click OK
when you’ve finished changing your settings. To see the results of any changes
you’ve made, you have to log out and then back in.
Workplace tab
You use the Workplace tab in the Set Personal Options window (refer to
Figure 4-1) to define your role in your organization and to tailor the work-
place to show any combination of sales, marketing, service, and scheduling
information. When you select the Marketing option, for example, marketing
lists, campaigns, and quick campaigns become available to you in the naviga-
tion pane. This list of options may also look different depending on how the
options were defined by your system administrator or implementation partner.
Simply click to remove the check mark from each of the four options in turn.
As you do so, fewer and fewer areas are displayed in the Preview panel on
the left. When all four workplace areas are turned off, the minimum areas are
available.
We recommend that you select just the one or two roles you usually play in
your organization. Selecting more won’t damage anything but will clutter the
screen with functions you don’t need. Our advice? If you’re in sales, select Sales
or Sales plus Marketing. If you’re in customer service, select Service or Service
plus Scheduling. If you’re in Marketing, don’t clutter up your workplace with
Service schedules but do select the other three.
54
Part II: Setting the Settings 

Activities tab
Activities is the third tab in the Set Personal Options window. This is where
you to specify your default calendar view, as shown in Figure 4-3.
A good choice is the weekly view, which is shown in Figure 4-4. The calendar
view, whether daily, weekly, or monthly, displays only appointments and none
of the other activities such as scheduled phone calls or tasks . If you want
to use any of the calendar views, and you want a realistic picture of what is
scheduled for you, make everything an appointment. We think a better option
is to use the Activities view, which shows all types of scheduled activities
including appointments and phone calls.
The second set of options (Set your default work hours) enables you to 
specify your typical workday hours. Although a Start Time of 2 PM and an
End Time of 3 PM sounds appealing, you should set this more realistically.
By default, your workplace calendar displays the hours you’ve selected as
your regular work schedule. If you happen to schedule an appointment out-
side those normal hours, it will still appear on your calendar.
Figure 4-3:

Activities
options.
55
Chapter 4: Personalizing Your System

The last area in the Activities tab is meant to allow you to better control the
onslaught of incoming e-mail. Microsoft has incorporated a token-based
system into CRM 3.0. If you select All e-mail messages, all e-mail that would
normally go to your Outlook inbox will go also to Microsoft CRM 3.0. If you
select e-mail messages that have a Microsoft CRM token, which means that
they were either sent from Microsoft CRM or you click the tracked in CRM
button in Outlook, only those messages will be brought into Microsoft CRM
automatically.
Each method has its strengths and weaknesses. As a general rule, if you use
the Outlook Client for Microsoft CRM, you should have Microsoft CRM auto-
matically capture e-mails with the tokens. If you typically use Internet Explorer
to access Microsoft CRM, select All e-mail.
E-mail Templates tab
The E-mail Templates tab enables you to create and customize templates for
almost every type of record in the database, assuming your security level
allows this. (Security and access rights are described in Chapter 5.) The ones
you create in this section are available only to you. To create templates for
the entire organization, use the Settings tab of Microsoft CRM.
Figure 4-4:

56
Part II: Setting the Settings 

This important personal setting enables you to create a powerful array of
standard documents that you can use, for example, as automatic responses
to inquiries about your products or services. This is a great way to expedite
your response to sales inquiries. Unlike fine wine, leads never improve with
age. From a list of templates you create, you can choose any template and
create a bulk e-mail, also known as a direct e-mail or an e-mail blast. Bulk
e-mail is a way to send one or more e-mails at one time easily and automati-
cally. Some people associate this with spam. As long as you are legitimately
responding to someone’s inquiry or have received permission to send elec-
tronic communications (also called opt-in mail), it is not spam and may be an
effective way to handle many routine business activities, including newslet-
ters and special announcements.
It is probably to your professional advantage to include a way for your e-mail
recipients to opt out of receiving e-mail from you. For more information, read:

See Figure 4-5 for an example of e-mail template titles. From the E-mail
Templates tab, you can highlight and drill down into each of the templates
that have been set up for your use. Or you can create new ones by clicking
the New button. E-mail templates are discussed in further detail in Chapter 12.

Chapter 4: Personalizing Your System

Your User Profile
Setting your user profile means telling the system who you are and your role
in the organization. Depending on the rights you have to the system, you may
need to approach your system administrator to change your user profile.
Even if you don’t have the rights to tinker with these settings, you should
know what options are available so you can at least provide input to the
system administrator.
Your user profile enables you to record information about yourself and your
relationship to your company, such as your title, the teams you work on, your
roles in the organization, and the times you are generally available. Your user
profile settings enable you to participate in one or more team activities and
to have a specific role in those activities.
Anyone can view anyone else’s user profile, but administrative rights may be
required to make changes.
To navigate to the user profile area, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Settings button.
A window with 11 choices appears.
2. In the Settings window, click the first option, Business Unit Settings.
3. Select Users.
The Users window appears.
4. Double-click the user (you) whose profile needs to be reviewed or
changed.
A window similar to the one in Figure 4-6 appears.
Your user profile may be displayed as read-only if your security settings do
not allow you to edit it. If this is the case, your system administrator will have
to make any necessary changes for you.
Your user profile contains seven categories, each of which is displayed in the
upper part of the navigation pane. These seven categories are divided into
two groups: Details and Service. The Details group applies to everyone; the
Service group applies specifically to customer service personnel. Service
groups are discussed in detail in Chapter 22.
Under the Details group are the Information, Teams, Roles, Quotas, and
Work Hours categories. You should go through each category sequentially to
view how your record is set up and to determine whether any changes are
required. Each of these categories defines a different aspect of your role in
the organization.
58
Part II: Setting the Settings 

Information
When you click Information in the navigation pane, you see the User window,
with two tabs: General and Addresses (refer to Figure 4-6). The fields labeled
in red are required; everything else is optional but recommended. Most of the
fields on the General tab are self-explanatory, but several deserve further
explanation:
 Domain Logon Name: The server or entire set of resources running your
CRM system.
 Business Unit: The organization to which you directly report.
 Manager: Your manager’s name. (This field may be important if your
system is designed to automatically escalate issues from one level of
management to another.)
 Territory: Particularly in sales, efforts are usually divided into regions
or territories. Each salesperson is usually associated with one territory.
The Addresses tab allows for two separate addresses. Everyone in your com-
pany should use these the same way. We recommend that you use the office
address as the Mailing Address and your home address as the Other Address.
It could just as well be the other way around, but everyone in your company
needs to conform to the same method.

Chapter 4: Personalizing Your System

Teams
Teams, the next selection in the navigation pane, is used to group users who
have the same basic role or who might need to share records.
Each user can be assigned to one or more teams. For example, you may be
involved in your company’s consulting efforts and also have some sales
responsibilities. By assigning yourself to both the consulting team and the
sales team, you assure yourself of being included in correspondence and
meetings for those two groups. All the teams in a particular organization are
displayed on the left. On the right are the teams to which the user has been
assigned.
Roles
Roles is the third selection in the navigation pane. Click the Roles option
from the navigation pane to display the Roles window. Highlight the specific
role you want to see, and then click Manage Roles from the window’s toolbar.
Microsoft CRM comes with a number of well-defined access rights, each asso-
ciated with different roles that people perform in a company. For example,
there’s a well-defined set of access rights for an individual salesperson and a
different set for the manager of customer service. You should have at least
one role and could have several. These assignments are normally part of the
initial configuration of the system and are usually the responsibility of your
administrator.
Quotas
Quotas is the next category under Details in the navigation pane. For more on
quotas, see Chapter 15. Quotas are relevant only for salespeople.
Work hours
The final category under Details is Work Hours. This is where each user’s
standard schedule is housed. You establish the typical work week and then
add specific time off. If your organization runs more than one shift, the Work
Hours area is where you indicate what shift each person is working. This area
can be used also to indicate, on a day-by-day basis, who is on vacation or oth-
erwise unavailable.
60
Part II: Setting the Settings 

To view or edit a user’s work hours, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Settings button.
2. In the Settings window, click Business Unit Settings.
3. Select Users.
The Users window appears.
4. Select the user whose work hours you want to view by highlighting
that user and clicking Work Hours from the navigation pane.
The window shown in Figure 4-7 appears.
5. In the top-left area, click the Set Up button.
This button is the key to managing each user’s work hours. Three
options appear, enabling you to set a new weekly schedule, set a unique
schedule for one day at a time, or schedule time off. Each option dis-
plays a simple entry screen.
6. Choose an option, fill in the entry screen, and then click OK.

I
n this day and age, security is important. As technology advances, 
so do the hackers, virus writers, and other malevolently minded folks.
With Microsoft CRM, you should be concerned with two types of security:
physical security and internal security. 
Physical security is a defense against everyone you don’t know and don’t
want to meet. These are the people who have nothing better to do than
develop and propagate viruses or, worse yet, spend their time hacking into
your system to either paralyze you or steal your stuff. This type of security
is generally handled by firewalls, routers, and other types of hardware and
software. Because the vast majority of CRM installations run only on your
intranet, this type of security is beyond the scope of this book. For more
information, see the Microsoft Implementation Guide. 
Information on Microsoft CRM–specific security patches are posted on the
Microsoft CRM Community site at
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=53254
Be sure to check the Web site regularly to ensure that you are fully up-to-date
on any security issues specifically affecting Microsoft CRM. 
The second type of security is aimed at your own usually well-meaning team
members. Some organizations, such as brokerage houses, are required to
restrict certain records even from members of their own staff. In other orga-
nizations, salespeople’s opportunities need to be hidden from the other
salespeople. In our company, we find it occasionally important to keep
e-mails away from prying eyes.

CRM has quite a bit of built-in security. And your system administrator, per-
haps with several people from your management team, will probably be
charged with setting up security and access rights within Microsoft CRM.
In this chapter, you find out about the types of security you should consider
and how to regulate your internal security.
Security Overview
Microsoft CRM’s security focuses on meeting the needs of most organizations
in two ways:
 Role-based security
 Object-based security
Role-based security in Microsoft CRM allows you to create a role, such as
Sales Executive, that controls what the user can do and has access to.
Your installation can also define its own roles to meet your requirements.
Object-based security in Microsoft CRM focuses on what access the roles
have to primary and extended entities (such as leads, opportunities, con-
tacts, accounts, and cases). So you could have the role of Sales Manager
and have access to change opportunities (an object) but only read cases
(another object).
User Privileges
Privileges are the most basic security option in Microsoft CRM and are gener-
ally set up by your administrator. User privileges determine what a user can
and can’t do, such as creating records or deleting records. (We recommend
that only a system administrator be allowed to delete records.) Altogether, a
user can do eight basic things: create, read, write (edit or modify), delete,
append, append to, assign, and share.
Access Levels
The next step above privileges, access levels help determine which records
the user privileges should apply to. In other words, your privileges may
include the ability to delete account records, but your access level deter-
mines exactly which records you are able to delete. Microsoft CRM defines
four access levels: user (least authority), business unit, parent/child, and
organization (most authority).
64
Part II: Setting the Settings 

Defining Roles
The concept of roles marries privileges and access rights. Microsoft CRM
comes with 13 predefined roles that are typical of a midsized organization, as
shown in Figure 5-1. Making use of these predefined roles saves a lot of time
that would otherwise be spent setting up specific access rights for each user. 
If you are going to make any changes to the default roles, we recommend that
you use the functionality Microsoft provides call Role Copy. Refer to the online
help on how to use this. 
In this section, we show you how to look at the roles that Microsoft CRM
ships with. Each of these roles has a complete set of predefined privileges
and access rights. The prototypical sales manager is given a default set of
privileges and access rights. To see the settings for each of default role,
follow these steps:
1. In the lower part of the navigation pane, click the Settings button.
The Settings window appears on the right.
2. Click Business Unit Settings.
3. Select Security Roles.
The Security Roles window appears, listing all existing roles (refer to
Figure 5-1).

roles out of

4. View the sales manager’s role by clicking his or her line in the list.
The Role: Sales Manager window appears. 
5. Click the Core Records tab.
The screen shown in Figure 5-2 appears. The Core Records tab contains
all the toggle switches to turn access rights on or off and is the central
storehouse for role information.
6. Click each tab in turn to see all the objects that can be accessed at var-
ious levels for the existing sales manager profile.
7. Click the Save and Close button to return to the Security Roles window.
If your business has specific business rules you need to enforce, you should
seek help from your system administrator or implementation partner.

Part II: Setting the Settings 

Assigning Roles
After you have defined a role, you need to assign it to the user. Every user in
the system must have at least one role to access the system. 
A user can have more than one assigned role. For example, someone could
have a role as a systems administrator and as a mailroom clerk. When a
single user has multiple roles with different privileges and access rights, the
role with the less restrictive privileges takes precedence. So, even when your
systems administrator is functioning as a mailroom clerk, he or she will have
the maximum levels of access rights.
If your organization is complex or you don’t understand Microsoft CRM’s 
concepts of roles, we suggest that you consult with an expert to help you
in setting up your roles and assigning them to users. 
To add a role to a user of the system, just follow these simple steps. 
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Settings button.
The Settings window appears.
2. Click Business Unit Settings.
3. Select Users.
The Users window appears, listing all current users.
4. Double-click a user name.
The User window appears.
5. In the navigation pane, click Roles. 
6. At the top of the Roles window, click Manage Roles.
7. Select the roles you want this user to have, and then click OK.
8. Click Save and Close. 
Sharing Information with Others 
on Your Team
Microsoft CRM has powerful security and record-sharing tools. If keeping 
certain records or data confidential is necessary for your company, that’s
no problem. Usually more critical than keeping data confidential, however, is
your ability to share information with other members of your team.
67
Chapter 5: Understanding Security and Access Rights

Defining a team
Before you set up your CRM system, we suggest that you do a bit of home-
work and planning. So get your management staff together and order pizza,
because you have got some brainstorming to do. You’ll want to figure out
your business units (think divisions or remote offices) and then assign users
to those units.
Typically, the users assigned to a particular business unit are also members
of a team. Each user in CRM can be a member of one or more teams. The con-
cept of a team allows for a convenient sharing of records.
Sharing and assigning
You can easily share records and activities with members of your team — and
you should. Sharing a record is like asking your buddies to help you when you
need it. Rest assured: If you ask them, they will return the favor. By sharing
and distributing the workload, you, your team members, and your customers
all benefit. While you’re on vacation, team members who have access to your
data while you’re away can still help your clients.
You can also assign records and tasks. Assigning is a little more like telling
another user on the system to handle the assignment. (It’s more like delegat-
ing than sharing.)
Unsharing
Whatever you share you can unshare. If you turned over access to your
clients while you were on vacation, you can retake control upon your return.
In most work environments, this is a far better solution than sending your
clients an e-mail telling them you will be away for two weeks and they should
just relax until you get back. And it’s certainly a better approach than not let-
ting your clients know that you’ll be away at all.
Sharing and Not Sharing Data 
The concept of sharing is also pertinent to security. Assuming you have shar-
ing privileges, you can regulate who else in your organization has access to
your records. By sharing your records with another user or a team, you’re
granting access to people who would not otherwise be able to view or modify
those records. 
68
Part II: Setting the Settings 

Sharing records
Granting sharing privileges to someone who already has organizational rights
(the highest level of access rights) really doesn’t accomplish anything.
Similarly, if you try to deny sharing rights to someone with organizational
rights, nothing is going to change. That’s like telling the boss he or she can’t
look over your shoulder.
Sharing is a good tool if, for example, you’re working on a deal in New York
and need to bring in a co-worker from Detroit. Under normal security, your
co-worker would not be able to view your records. By sharing, you can give
him or her access to the record to help work the deal. 
You can share almost any kind of record, but we will use an account record as
an example. Follow these steps to share an account:
1. At the top of the navigation pane, select Accounts.
The Accounts window appears on the right.
2. Select a record by double-clicking. 
The General tab for that account appears.
3. On the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Actions➪Sharing.
The window shown in Figure 5-3 appears.

4. In the Common Tasks pane on the left, select Add User/Team.
The Look Up Records dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-4.
5. In the Look For field, select User or Team, and then click the Find
button.
All available users or teams are displayed.
6. Double-click any user (or team) from the list in the left panel.
Another method is to highlight the user (or team) and click the right-
facing arrow button. The user (or team) is transferred to the right pane
in anticipation of sharing the record with that user or team.
7. Click OK.
The window shown in Figure 5-5 appears. 
8. Specify which permissions you are allowing for this record.
To do so, check or uncheck each of the boxes that relate to the rights
you are granting. As easily as you can share a record, you can also
unshare it.
9. Click OK when you’re satisfied that you’ve shared enough rights.
The window for the record reappears, but now these other users have as
much access to the record as you’ve granted them.

Unsharing records
If you can share it, you can unshare it. For example, before going on vacation,
you may want to share all your records with one of your peers. When you
return, you probably want to unshare them and resume your usual tasks. To
unshare a record, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the record you want to unshare.
2. On the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Actions➪
Sharing.
3. Toggle the Share check box to remove the check mark. 
If you granted sharing rights to more than one user, you can eliminate
multiple users’ rights by toggling each of their Share check boxes on this
one screen.
4. Click OK. 
The system returns to the General tab of the account record.

Chapter 5: Understanding Security and Access Rights

Streamlining the assignment 
of permissions
If you share with multiple people or multiple teams, you can end up having to
deal with quite a few check boxes. Microsoft CRM provides two additional
options in the Common Tasks panel to streamline your efforts:
 Toggle All Permissions of the Selected Items: After you’ve selected one
or more users, this option acts like a toggle switch for all the permissions
for that user. This is an easy way to grant permissions across the board
for multiple users.
 Reset: This is like a do over button. Selecting Reset brings you back to
the settings you had before the last time you clicked the OK button.
Other systems sometimes refer to this as an undo button.
No form of security is ever foolproof. Although Microsoft CRM provides a
sophisticated security system, this issue should remain a high priority.
Security threats can come from anywhere: from your staff ( innocent mis-
takes or not-so-innocent sabotage) and from outside hackers. 
Remember, no system is foolproof (remember the Titanic?), but you can
develop an efficient compromise and make your system user-friendly and
hacker-unfriendly. 
And, don’t forget the Minions of Chaos and always back up your data.

Managing Territories, Business
Units, and Teams
In This Chapter
 Defining your territories
 Managing your territories
 Managing your business units
 Creating your teams
T
erritories, teams, and business units are three organizational concepts
that are so closely linked that you need to understand all three before
deciding how to handle any one of them.
Typically, you establish territories to manage sales in bite-sized chunks. You
probably want to develop a sales quota for your company in each territory and
then check forecasted sales and closed sales against the quotas you’ve set.
(We talk more about assigning quotas and forecasting sales in Chapter 15.)
You may also want to use territories as a way to ensure that customers are
equitably distributed among salespeople. By using Microsoft CRM, you can
measure equitable distribution by geography, the number of customers,
account revenue, or some combination of all three factors.
Territories come into play when assigning accounts and when reporting on
them. In this chapter, we explain how to set up territories, business units,
and teams.
Setting Up Sales Territories
Every account record has one field called Territory. After you define your 
territories, you manually enter the proper territory for each account record.
You can do this from a drop-down list that your database administrator sets
up, or you can use workflow rules to automatically assign an account to a ter-
ritory. Assignments can be based on state, province, zip or postal code, or
some combination of these.

Don’t use telephone area codes for territory definitions. Area codes change
too often and, in the U.S., are not geographically consistent. On top of that,
with many people using cellphones or Internet phones, it’s hard to relate
phone numbers to geography.
Implementing workflow rules is a powerful way to have Microsoft CRM do a
tremendous amount of work for you. A workflow rule can be attached to
every new record, can check the physical location of that account or contact,
and can assign it to a territory. Setting up such rules is appropriate for this
or any kind of procedure that is well defined and frequently repeated. See
Chapter 8 for a discussion of workflow rules.
Each user can be assigned to a single territory and is designated as either a
territory user (a member of a team) or as the territory manager.
The task of setting up and managing territories is usually reserved for people
with administrative rights. If you don’t already have territories defined, this is
a good time to do so. Follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Settings button.
The Settings window with its 11 options appears.
2. Select Sales Territories.
The Sales Territories window shown in Figure 6-1 appears. This is a typi-
cal view displaying the territories already in your system, presumably
put there by your system administrator or by a sales manager.
3. In the Sales Territories window’s toolbar, click the New button to add
a new territory.
4. Fill in the General tab as follows:
a. In the Territory Name field, enter a unique Territory Name.
b. To the right of the Manager field, select a territory manager for
that territory from the drop-down list.
c. If your territory names are not self-explanatory, be sure to enter
a description.
For example, if the Territory Name is New England, you should list
the individual states in the Description field. See Figure 6-2.
5. At the top of the screen, click Save (the disk icon).
Note that the Members option in the navigation pane is now available.
The users assigned to a territory are called members of that territory.
After you set up a territory, you can add users to that territory.

6. Add a user (member) to the territory as follows:
a. At the top of the navigation pane, select Members.
b. In the window’s toolbar, click the Add Members button.
You see a list of available users in the Look Up Records window.
Because an individual user can be assigned to only one territory,
the available users display in Figure 6-3 shows only unassigned
users.
c. From the available users, select one or more users (that is, mem-
bers) for a territory.
7. After you finish adding users to a territory, click the Save and Close
button.
You return to the Sales Territories window.
Sometimes you may think that you need to assign someone to more than
one territory. For example, if the Mid-Atlantic manager leaves, you may need
to have the New England manager temporarily take over both territories.
You do this by defining a new territory that encompasses both the New
England and the Mid-Atlantic regions.

Part II: Setting the Settings 

Managing Territories
If you plan to assign accounts to territories, you need to ensure that the
Territory field for every account is filled in. You can do this by establishing
workflow rules that automatically assign territories based on the City or
State fields.
You can ensure that every account is assigned to a territory in several ways:
 Make the Territory field into a business-recommended field. (Creating
Business Recommended fields is a system administrator function.)
This designation turns the field label blue, indicating to the user that
entering data in this field is important. The business recommended 
designation does not force the entry of data.
 Make the Territory field into a business-required field. (This is also a
system administrator function.) With this designation, which turns the
field label red, no one can save the record unless the field is filled in.
 Send missing data alerts by using a third-party alert system, such as
KnowledgeSync (which is discussed in Chapter 28). An alert system
sends a pop-up alarm or report to a user or manager when critical data
has not been entered into a new record. These alarms work only after a
record has been saved.
After you do everything possible to make sure every account is assigned to a
territory, you’d think you’d be done with it. But, things change. Salespeople
leave or get reassigned. New salespeople appear. Territories are merged.
It’s not enough to just assign a salesperson to a territory. You must be 
vigilant to ensure that the assignments still make sense.
When customers are assigned to a territory or reassigned, the account manager
should be notified. In a perfect world, the customers should also be notified
that they have a new account manager.
When one or more accounts have been added to an account manager’s list,
the first thing to do is to notify the account manager.
Although this seems obvious, no function is built into the software to make
this happen automatically. If a salesperson already has several hundred
accounts, he or she may not notice for a long time that a half dozen new
accounts were just added to the list.
77
Chapter 6: Managing Territories, Business Units, and Teams

Workflow rules (discussed in Chapter 8) are an effective way to provide this
notification. Failing that, you can resort to the old-fashioned method of either
telling the salesperson or printing a report of existing customers and high-
lighting the new ones with a yellow marker.
The second notification needs to go to the client. Whenever an account 
manager changes, it is critical to inform all affected customers. With the
appropriate workflow rules, you can accomplish this by an e-mail, a fax, a
template letter, a scheduled phone call, or a visit.
Managing Business Units
A business unit is analogous to a division or a profit center in a company.
But the concept of business units in Microsoft CRM allows more flexibility
than the simple concept of divisions in a company. Rather, business units
are more like organizational charts. They also play a large role in the security
model of Microsoft CRM.
For example, suppose a software dealership has three main business units:
software, hardware/networking, and professional services. One or more of
these units might have subunits. Maybe the software business unit is further
divided into three brands of software. Each of those three is also a business
unit. The security division might be broken down into the firewall, the spy-
ware, and the antispam units.
To set up business units, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Settings button.
2. In the window on the right, select Business Unit Settings.
3. Select Business Units.
The screen shown in Figure 6-4 appears.
4. On the Business Units window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Business Unit: New window appears, as shown in Figure 6-5.
5. After filling in the relevant fields (most notably Name and Division),
click Save and Close.
The system returns to the Business Units window, where you see your
new business unit.

Chapter 6: Managing Territories, Business Units, and Teams

After you create a business unit and link it to its parent unit (and maybe even
give it some children), you can reorganize your business units at any time.
After you create your business units, you can assign teams of users to them.
That’s the topic of the next section.
Managing Teams
You might have a team of people who work together to service customers in
a particular territory. Perhaps you have a separate team for each territory.
Or you may have teams that are made up of users with similar skill sets.
For example, you might have a sales team, a marketing team, and a technical
support team. In this case, you would want to assign your teams to business
units.
Unlike territory assignments, in which each user can be in only one territory,
each user can be a member of many teams. In all likelihood, this will be the
case, with a typical user being a member of, say, the sales team, the process
brainstorming team, and the summer-picnic planning team.
The concept of sharing is also important to teams. Although you can’t assign
an account to a team, you can share an account with a team. In this section,
we describe creating teams and assigning members to teams.
Creating teams
After you create a business unit, you can create and assign teams to that unit.
To create a team and assign it to a business unit, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Settings button.
2. Select Business Unit Settings.
3. Select Business Units.
4. Double-click the business unit to which you want to assign one or
more teams.
The Business Units window appears.
5. In the upper part of the navigation pane, select Teams.
6. In the window’s toolbar, click the New Team button.
The screen shown in Figure 6-6 appears.
80
Part II: Setting the Settings 

7. Fill in the Team Name field.
The business unit you selected in Step 4 is automatically filled in for you,
although you can change this association by clicking the magnifying glass
to the right of the Business Unit field.
8. Click Save and Close.
The system returns to the listing for that particular business unit.
If you create a team without assigning it to a specific business unit, by default
it will be assigned to the overall parent unit. After a team is assigned to any
business unit, you can’t reassign it to another business unit. However, you
can disable the team and start fresh with a new team.
Assigning users to teams
When you initially create a team, it has no members. But after the team is cre-
ated, it’s easy to add or later remove members.
To add one or more members to a team, follow these steps:
1. At the top of the navigation pane, select Members.
Figure 6-6:

2. In the window’s toolbar, click the Add Members button and then click
the Find button.
The Look Up Records dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-7.
3. In the left panel, double-click each member that you want to add to
your team.
4. When you’ve finished assembling the team, click OK at the bottom of
the window.
The system returns to that team’s listing.
In this chapter, you’ve seen how to define and create territories, business
units, and teams. Each user can be assigned to only one territory but may be
a member of several teams and business units. By assigning users to teams,
you can easily share and shift responsibilities between teams.

Developing Processes
In This Chapter
 Understanding general process principles
 Adding and configuring sales stages
B
usiness processes are intertwined with the workflow rules discussed in
detail in Chapter 8. In this chapter, we discuss some of the basic princi-
ples involved in designing your processes and how those design principles
can be implemented in Microsoft CRM.
In the almost 20 years that we have been designing and implementing CRM
systems (not always Microsoft CRM, of course), it has been made clear again
and again that two basic features allow CRM to earn its keep. The first is its
ability to consolidate an entire organization’s data into one useful, shareable
place. This is not to be underestimated.
The second is its ability to automate business processes. The implementa-
tion of workflow not only forces you to think about — and then continuously
rethink — your business processes but also allows you to replace notoriously
inconsistent human activity with automation that always follows the rules.
Sadly, more than 90 percent of CRM implementations never achieve that
automation. That initial goal seems to get lost in the effort to get the system
up and running and the staff using the software. Too often, we are out of
energy and money to invest further in developing the workflow that really
makes the investment in CRM pay for itself. If you want to maximize the value
of your system, however, do not allow yourself to run out of resources before
the entire job is finished.
A good process guides your people through a series of well-documented
steps for almost every type of situation. For example, although you can do
a quote before properly qualifying an account, any well-thought-out system
discourages this. Or you may remember to call a prospect back after sending
a quote, but a good workflow-based process won’t let you forget.

In this chapter, you find out how to plan your sales stages and how to relate
these sales stages and other processes to your CRM system. You also discover
the basic principles of process design and how these affect the design of your
overall CRM system.
In the next chapter, you implement one of your well-thought-out processes in
the Workflow Manager. Actually, it may not be one of your well-thought-out
processes, but it might be similar to one of yours.
The General Principles
A good business process includes the concepts of alerts, escalation, feed-
back, and analysis. Each of these principles is described in this section.
Alerts
An alert, which is often an e-mail notice or some kind of screen pop-up, is
called for when an activity should have been completed but for some reason
was not. For example, if you’ve obtained verbal approval and the prospect
promises a written PO within a week, the system should alert the account
manager 10 days later if that PO has not arrived. (If you’re a Type A personal-
ity, you may want to adjust your waiting period to 10 minutes.)
Alerts are appropriate also as a warning that an upcoming activity is almost
due. For example, you might want a polite warning 30 days before a client’s
annual contract needs renewal.
Depending on the number of alerts you anticipate, you may decide on individ-
ual e-mail notices for each alert, or you may want a single e-mail or report that
contains all the alerts. A typical sales alert might be to let a manager know on
the 18th of the month that a forecasted sale that was slated to close on the
15th has not closed yet. If you expect more than two or three of these alerts,
you will be better off planning to put them in a consolidated report that the
manager receives. Otherwise, you risk clogging up your manager’s in box
with dozens of these warnings, which he or she will soon learn to ignore.
Escalation
When something doesn’t get done on time, someone needs to know. Now, you
can do this properly, or you can do this in a way that gets everyone upset.
84
Part II: Setting the Settings 

Escalations are typically done by e-mail notices, by automatically scheduling
activities, or by some combination of the two.
Typical activities that deserve escalation are sales that haven’t closed
when predicted or customer support issues that haven’t been resolved 
in a timely way.
To be fair, the first step in escalating any issue is to notify the person to
whom the issue was originally assigned. There might be a perfectly valid
reason why the issue hasn’t been resolved, and you should allow the original
person to resolve it.
If the task or issue still hasn’t been resolved within a few days, a notice
should go to the original person’s manager.
CRM can’t send a notice to the manager unless it knows who that person is.
Each user’s record has a field for the user’s manager’s name. Escalating issues
is probably the best use of this field.
The typical steps of an escalation plan are as follows:
1. Test to see whether an alert is required.
2. Send an initial alert to the primary user.
3. Wait a reasonable period (one to seven days, for example) and test
again. If the issue is still not resolved, escalate to the primary user’s
manager.
4. Test again a reasonable time later. If the issue is still not resolved, notify
the manager’s manager. Continue this notification until you run out of
management levels. Adjust the waiting period between notifications as
appropriate.
Each time a manager is notified, all users who received prior notifications
should be copied.
Feedback and analysis
It’s not a good process unless you can measure it. Losing weight is a process.
Before you start that process, you undoubtedly weigh yourself and continue
to do so as you work toward your desired weight. Without measuring, you
don’t know how well you’re doing, and you can’t make midcourse correc-
tions. Business processes are the same.
85
Chapter 7: Developing Processes

If you’re implementing a sales process whose focus is to move each sale from
one stage to the next, you want to measure a number of factors. You probably
want to know:
 Where and when the lead originated. The purpose of tracking the source
of each new record is to be able to better allocate your marketing dollars
by determining which lead sources are best.
 Who is working on the lead. Aside from wanting to give credit where
credit is due — that is, commissions, bonuses, or a pat on the back —
you also want to identify salespeople who may be having problems with
particular types or stages of sales so you can correct these problems.
 How long it takes to get from each stage to the next. If your sales are
being bogged down at a particular stage, you want to know that and
make corrections to your process or workflow.
Planning Your Sales Stages
Microsoft Corporation and Microsoft CRM both follow the sales process called
Solution Selling, which was originated by Sales Performance International. If
you haven’t taken one of the classes, read one of the books that provides an
overview of this sales philosophy. We are partial to Solution Selling: Creating
Buyers in Difficult Selling Markets, by Michael T. Bosworth.
If your company already has a sales process other than Solution Selling in
place, that’s okay. Microsoft CRM has enough flexibility to allow you to con-
figure almost any kind of process.
Your organization undoubtedly needs more than one process. For example,
if you sell software and technical support, the associated sales cycles and
techniques will be different, and you’ll want a process for each type of sale.
Also, you may need a different sales strategy just based on the size of the
potential deal or even the size of the prospect. You would sell 2 pounds of
nails to a homeowner in a different manner than you would sell 200 tons of
nails to a home improvement store.
In CRM, sales processes are associated with opportunity records. Although
you may consider the sales process to begin when a lead is entered, this isn’t
the case. The process can’t begin until you convert a lead to an opportunity.
We distinguish a lead from an opportunity the same way we distinguish a sus-
pect from a prospect. It’s not an opportunity or a prospect until this potential
customer has expressed some interest in your products or services. After
that has happened, you may have an opportunity, and it’s time for the sales
process to begin.
86
Part II: Setting the Settings 

No immutable laws govern the development of a sales process. The sales
process police won’t be knocking at your door if you have too few or too
many stages, but sales processes do have a few guidelines.
The more complex or the longer your sales cycle is, the more stages you’ll
need to describe where the deal is in your pipeline. However, the more stages
you program into the cycle, the more likely your salespeople will object to
being forced to enter unnecessary data or take unnecessary steps. So, the
simpler, the better — with an eye toward gathering good information about
where sales bog down or at what point a particular salesperson begins to
struggle.
In Table 7-1, we present a typical sales cycle. Before you can begin to imple-
ment CRM’s workflow rules, you must define your process. Start with the
table and compare it with your own existing sales steps. Chances are, you
don’t even have a well-documented set of steps. Now’s the time to begin 
creating that system.

Chapter 7: Developing Processes

Select your simplest product or service and compare the steps you use to the
steps in Table 7-1. Then create a table that best follows either the steps you
are taking today or, better yet, the steps you think you should be taking.
Before you just jump in and begin programming the workflow rules described
in Chapter 8, you need to organize your thoughts. Convene a brainstorming
session with the users who are involved on a day-by-day basis with each
process you want to automate.
The result of that brainstorming session should be a detailed outline or dia-
gram of the process. Each outline needs to include, for each step:
 The action that will be taken
 Who will be responsible for that action
 What will trigger the action (for example, a change in the data or a
missed appointment)
 How to escalate if the action is not completed
After you have this set for each step of the process, it’s time to go to Chapter 8
and begin making your new process happen.

Implementing Rules and Workflow

 Understanding what workflow can’t do

W
orkflow — I know what you’re thinking. Workflow? What is that?
Well, as one of the most powerful functions of Microsoft CRM, 
workflow is the nearest thing you’ll find to a money machine.
The Workflow Management System takes your manual business rules (or pro-
cedures) and turns them into an automated system. Without workflow, you’d
have a database with names, addresses, and a schedule, but the database by
itself wouldn’t do anything. With workflow, Microsoft CRM becomes a system
that farms your existing accounts for additional business, helps you hunt for
new accounts, and ensures that important tasks do not slip through the cracks.
Whooaa. That’s a pretty hefty statement, isn’t it? However, by providing you
with electronic business alerts, Microsoft CRM can step beyond being your
contact/account database and become an important part of your business
and corporate culture.
You probably have many business rules already in place, even if they aren’t set
in writing and mentioned all the time. For example, do you return a phone call
to a client who asks you to call him back? That’s a business rule, and workflow
might automate that business rule by sending you an electronic reminder
message — again and again — until you actually make the call. Your business
rule has now become a workflow rule. I like to call this one “auto-nag.”
Now, before you go and start plugging in workflow rules, we recommend that
you review all your current business processes. This may take some time.
You should consult with the CEO, his or her assistant, the sales department,
the marketing department — you get the idea. This is also the best time to do
spring cleaning. Get rid of business rules that worked before the advent of the
Internet, and update others or make new ones. Automating an ineffective pro-
cedure is like building a faster Edsel. The speed is there, but it’s still an Edsel.

In this chapter, we touch on the general principles of implementing workflow
rules and then provide you with an example of a typical rule. You also find the
background and basis to design and implement at least some simple workflow
rules of your own. However, keep in mind that the creation of complex work-
flow rules is probably best left to professional Microsoft CRM consultants or
dealers.
Describing the Limitations of Workflow
Let’s start from the beginning. Workflow may sound complicated, but once you
get the knack of it, it’s fairly simple. Workflow has two main modules: Manager
and Monitor. Manager enables you to develop and use workflow rules, which is
nothing more than a system to automate the business processes you already
have and use. Monitor provides a display of the current status of each rule. You
can see exactly which processes are running and which ones may be waiting
for a triggering event.
Although Workflow is a powerful utility, it’s not Super Program and does have
some limitations. For example:
 Workflow can monitor data and events within the Microsoft CRM database
but not outside it, unless you write a custom .Net assembly. (More on
.Net assembly in a moment.)
 A workflow rule can’t check for data in more than one object (accounts
or contact records or case records) at one time. For example, a workflow
rule can look through all your accounts to notify you of any that are
missing telephone numbers, but a single workflow rule can’t check for
accounts that are missing phone numbers and have open cases more
than two weeks old.
 Workflow rules have difficulty checking for the absence of an event,
meaning they can alert you to an open or uncompleted appointment 
but don’t tell you about stuff that wasn’t scheduled but should have
been. (It’s a software program, not a mind-meld machine.)
Microsoft CRM allows you to write a small piece of code called a .Net assem-
bly that does some custom functions. For example, if you want Microsoft
CRM to check the credit on one of your customers and update the customer
record with their FICO score, you could write a small .Net assembly that calls
another application to get that information and then updates Microsoft CRM.
Based on the returned score, Microsoft CRM could then finish processing the
rest of the rule you set up.

A third-party business alert system, KnowledgeSync, enables you to look at
multiple databases and multiple types of records. We describe KnowledgeSync
in Chapter 28. If you anticipate the need to build sophisticated rules and
alerts, and you don’t want to write any custom code, you may want this 
add-on program.
An important step in creating your workflows is to think through the flow
itself carefully. What are the exceptions? What conditions should terminate
the process? For example, if someone buys something, workflow should 
start treating the person as a new customer and not as a prospect.
Creating Workflow Rules
For creating your workflow rules, we recommend that you use members of
your staff who work with the product on a daily basis, both on the adminis-
trative side and the operations side. This way, you cover your business
processes from all angles.
Now, we do suggest letting your company’s system administrator be the only
person to set up workflow rules. Not only is Workflow Manager accessed
directly from the Microsoft CRM server, those sys admins can be territorial!
One of the most common tasks your company may want to automate is the
assignment of an account manager to a newly created account. We use that
as our example for creating a workflow rule:
1. Choose Start➪Programs➪Microsoft CRM➪Workflow Manager.
This particular feature is not accessed from the open Microsoft CRM
program. The Workflow Manager Log On dialog box appears.
2. Enter the name of the Microsoft CRM server you want to target, and
then click OK.
The name you enter is the server your Microsoft CRM is on. When you
click OK, the Microsoft CRM Workflow Manager window appears, as
shown in Figure 8-1.
3. Choose an entity type and a view.
The Entity Type option is the type of record (account, contact, lead, and
so on) that your workflow rule focuses on. Click the down arrow to the
right of the field to open the drop-down box and choose the entity you
want to work with. Just a quick note, as our underpaid office manager
discovered, if you shrink this window, the drop-down arrow disappears.
If that happens, just click inside the Entity Type field to open the drop-
down box.
91
Chapter 8: Implementing Rules and Workflow

Over in View, click the down arrow to the right of the field to open the
drop-down list and choose to make a rule or a rule template (workflow
rule templates are discussed later in this chapter).
For this exercise, we chose Account for Entity Type and Rule under View.
4. In the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose File➪New.
You can also click the little blank paper icon in the toolbar. The Create
Workflow Rule dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-2. Note that the
Entity field is already filled in with your choice from the preceding step.
5. Enter a name, description, and event for your rule.
Keep in mind that the Name field is required but the description field is
not. In the Event field, click in the field or click on the drop-down arrow
next to the field. A list appears with the following choices: Manual, Assign,
Create, and Change Status. (We provide a description of these at the end
of the chapter.) For our example, we’re going to choose Create, because
the creation of a new record will trigger this workflow rule. If you want
to use this rule for the creation of a subprocess later, be sure to mark
this one Manual.
6. Click Next.
The Select Behavior window appears, as shown in Figure 8-3, with a
Common Tasks pane and a workspace.

7. In the Common Tasks pane, click Insert Condition, and select a 
condition.
When you click Insert Condition, a small submenu appears practically
on top of the option, with three choices: Check conditions, Wait for con-
ditions, and Wait for timer. To follow along with the example, select
Check conditions, which automatically inserts an If/Then clause in the
main window with options to add conditions and actions. For a descrip-
tion of these options, see the end of this chapter.
8. Highlight <<add conditions here>> in the workspace, click Insert
Condition in the Common Tasks window, and select a condition.
To follow along with the example, select Check entity. The Check Entity
Condition dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-4. The two named
fields are Entity and Field; the two unlabeled ones become activated
based on what you select in Field.
9. Click the down arrow by Field and select an option.
Just about every field in Microsoft CRM is available here. If you wanted
to assign only records in Massachusetts to your account manager, Ted,
for example, you would choose any of the fields for State.
10. In the unlabeled field in the center of the window, click the down
arrow and select an option among the many choices.
The null operator allows you to test whether a field is blank or empty.
You would use null to test, for example, whether a phone number or an
e-mail address exists. The combinations of =, <, and > operators can be
used equally well with text and date fields.
The Contains, Begins with, and Ends with operators can produce surpris-
ing results if you don’t carefully consider what data these expressions
might find. For example, if you search for records containing East, you
also get records containing beast.

11. In the next unlabeled field, click the ellipsis button (the three dots).
The Select Value dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-5.
12. Enter the data the rule should search for, and then click OK.
For example, if you selected State in Step 9, you could put the state here
in the Static Value field. If you wanted to compare two fields, you could
select Dynamic Value.
13. Click OK in the Create Condition dialog box.
You return to the Select Behavior dialog box.
14. Highlight <<add actions here>> in the workspace, click Insert Action
in the Common Tasks pane, and select an action.
The action you select tells the program what you want done when the
condition you set in Steps 11–13 is met. A list of actions and their
descriptions is at the end of this chapter.
15. Click OK or Close to return to the Select Behavior dialog window.
16. Click Save to save the new rule.
The Select Behavior window closes, taking you back to the Microsoft
CRM Workflow Manager, where your rule should now be listed.
17. To activate the new rule, click the Activate button in the toolbar.
If you forget to do this, your perfectly good new rule will sit there for-
ever, forlorn and lost.

Chapter 8: Implementing Rules and Workflow

Testing a new rule
Throughout this book, you will find reference to our office manager’s arch
nemeses, the Minions of Chaos. They love to sneak inside your database and
wreak havoc. Remember this because they can make an appearance at any
moment, now that you’ve created your workflow rules.
Back to the workflow rules. They’re complete and ready to go, so you load
them up and awwaayy you go, right? Negative, databoy.
Loading an untested workflow rule on your active database is an invitation 
to the MoC, who want nothing more to get in and show you any errors or
glitches that are on your live system — by bringing your system to a grinding
halt as that workflow rule runs amok on your data. Okay, this is dramatic, 
but we must stress the importance of testing your workflow rules before
you make them live features of your Microsoft CRM.
The good news is that testing your workflow rule is easy. Here’s how:
1. Now that you’ve created your workflow rule, go ahead and start
Microsoft CRM.
2. Create a condition in your database that should trigger the workflow
rule.
For example, if you set your workflow rule to trigger on every new
account created in the system, go ahead and create an account and
remember to save, Save, SAVE and Close the record.
3. Reopen the record you just created so you can check for the intended
result.
If the rule said to assign every new account to Bob, you would check to
see whether Bob was listed as the owner.
If you don’t see the desired result, you either failed to activate your rule, or
you need to review the rule criteria and specifics to determine the cause of
the problem. Always go back and check out how you built the workflow rule
first before assuming there’s a bug in the program, because most computer
errors are the result of operator error.
Creating a manual rule
Manual rules are just what the title claims. Sort of. A manual rule is a rule that
can only be invoked manually and not automatically (at least not directly).
For those of you designing complex workflow rules, manual rules can be
called by another rule. By calling, we mean that each rule should do one or
two simple things and should then trigger, or call, another rule if more func-
tionality is needed.
96
Part II: Setting the Settings 

Speaking of calling, try to avoid creating a giant workflow rule Godzilla.
Instead of one massive process, it may be easier to put together a series of
simple manual rules that call each other. You could also do what computer
programmers do (no, not change people’s passwords for fun) and create
small modules of code, or in this case, workflow rules that can be reused for
many different applications.
Remember how we activated the workflow rule we just created, as the last
step? Manual rules, just like all the other rules, must be active before they
can be invoked or called.
Workflow rules are great if everyone remembers to invoke or trigger them.
The key word here is remembers. In today’s offices, most people are so busy
answering the phone, dealing with customer service issues, and making sales
calls that things are bound to slip through the cracks. We suggest that you
create a system with a master workflow rule that automatically attaches to
every new record and begins a sequence of calling additional rules as condi-
tions in that record warrant.
Creating follow-up rules
Almost every business does some sort of follow-up with its customers, and
yours is probably no exception. You may want to send a thank-you e-mail for
a recent purchase, or you may want a call scheduled for accounts that have
had no activity for 60 days. This is called a follow-up rule, and it’s usually a
manual one. The steps are similar to creating a rule in the first place, so we’ll
just touch on them here and make sure we point out the variations.
To create a manual rule that assigns a follow-up activity to the owner of an
account, follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪Programs➪Microsoft CRM➪Workflow Manager.
2. Enter the name of the Microsoft CRM server you want to target, and
then click OK.
The Microsoft CRM Workflow Manager main window appears.
3. Select an entity type and a rule from the view drop-down lists, just as
we did earlier.
No changes here. You still want your entity type and rule for your 
selections.
4. Choose File➪New.
The Create a Workflow Rule Template window appears.
97
Chapter 8: Implementing Rules and Workflow

5. Enter a name, description, and event for your follow-up rule.
Here’s a slight variation. Choose Manual from the Event drop-down box
and click Next to open the Select Behavior window. Now you can begin
building the conditions and actions of your new manual rule.
6. Follow Steps 7–14 under “Creating Workflow Rules.”
As mentioned earlier, the steps mostly mirror the ones you use to create
a workflow rule. You should be in the Select Behavior dialog box to con-
tinue with Steps 7–14.
7. In the Common Tasks pane, click Insert Action. From the pop-up
menu, select Create activity.
The Create Activity window appears, as shown in Figure 8-6. Here, you
can specify what tasks the follow-up rule should perform when it is
called, or triggered.
8. Enter a subject and a description for this new activity.
For example, in the Subject field, you might enter New Account or
Assigning an Account Manager to a new Account.
9. Enter a priority and a due date.
The due date isn’t so much an actual date but a length of time you want
the system to wait before it sends the letter or fax or prompts you to
perform the task or make the phone call. The priorities are low, normal,
and high.
Figure 8-6:

call, fax, or

98
Part II: Setting the Settings 

10. Click the Create Activity button.
You return to the Select Behavior dialog box.
11. Click Save and then Close.
You can return to the Workflow Manager window, where your follow-up
rule is now listed.
12. Right-click the rule and choose Activate.
Remember, rules do nothing unless you activate them.
Testing a manual rule
Remember the Minions of Chaos mentioned earlier? They do not discriminate
between automatic rules and manual ones, so you’ll want to test these as
well.
The steps for testing follow-up rules are different than those for testing auto-
matic ones:
1. Create a condition in Microsoft CRM that triggers the original rule.
A good example is the New Account workflow rule we just created.
2. In Microsoft CRM, use the navigation page to find and highlight the
account.
3. In the window’s toolbar, click More Actions and choose Apply Rule.
The Apply Rule dialog box appears.
4. Select your workflow process from the pull-down list, and then 
click OK.
The process begins to run invisibly.
5. Go to the workplace and click Activities in the upper part of the navi-
gation pane.
You should see the follow-up activity listed there (if the activity was
assigned to you, anyway).
Monitoring Your Workflow
Now that you have all those workflow rules processing merrily away, you
want to see them all on one screen, without having to go to every account or
99
Chapter 8: Implementing Rules and Workflow

contact to see whether a rule has been applied. You can do this through the
Workflow Monitor. Like Workflow Manager, Workflow Monitor is a separate
program that operates outside the Microsoft CRM program. It also keeps a
log of processes that are currently active and records which ones have
already been run. This application, like Workflow Manager, can be accessed
only from the Microsoft CRM Server.
Here’s how you access the Workflow Monitor:
1. Choose Start➪Programs➪Microsoft CRM➪Workflow Monitor.
The Workflow Monitor Log In window appears.
2. Enter the name of your CRM server and then click OK.
The Workflow Monitor window appears, as shown in Figure 8-7, open to
the Process tab. In this display, you can see which processes are active
and paused.
3. To see what processes have been run, click the Log tab.
You can sort the items by clicking the header for each column. You can
also export the log to save it (click Actions➪Export Log).

Part II: Setting the Settings 

The Workflow Monitor only shows workflow rules that have been triggered.
Even though you may have additional rules activated, they remain invisible
to the Monitor when an event triggers them.
Workflow Glossary
Throughout this chapter, we tell you to select an event, or choose an action,
or set a condition. Maybe you’re wondering what, exactly, constitutes an
event, action, or condition. Well, we list them all here, in a one-stop, look-see
that’s easy to find.
Events
In Microsoft CRM, an event is the trigger condition that initiates a workflow
rule. For example, you can set a workflow rule for Assign, and anything that is
assigned has that workflow rule applied to it. Microsoft CRM has four events:
 Assign: Assigns (or reassigns) a record to a different user or team. CRM
e-mails the new user, notifying him or her of new tasks.
 Create: Enter a lead, and CRM assigns the account to the appropriate
account manager and notifies him or her of that assignment.
 State change: CRM monitors whether records have changed state from
active to inactive.
 Manual: All workflow rules can be invoked manually. Workflow rules can
also be categorized as specifically manual, in which case they can be
invoked only manually. To perform this invocation, select Apply Rule
from the Actions tab of the Workflow Manager window.
Conditions
Every business process is triggered by some change in a condition. That con-
dition might be a change in a data field, a due date being passed, or a record
being created. The Conditions section of the Workflow Manager enables you
to initiate an action based on a field or an activity that has changed or based
on an amount of time that has transpired.
101
Chapter 8: Implementing Rules and Workflow

The options for possible conditions are as follows:
 Check Object Conditions: This enables you to drill down to a specific
field in a record. For example, if the State field is New York, an action can
be taken to assign the New York sales rep to the account. Based on the
type of field (whether it’s a numeric, text, or date field, for example), var-
ious operators are available.
 Check Activities: By checking activities, you can initiate actions based
on scheduled or completed activities.
 Else if: This enables you to nest additional condition statements saying
that if the first condition is false, evaluate the second condition.
 Wait for Conditions: Workflow can wait for a specified amount of time
until the specified criteria becomes true before the rest of the rule is
completed. This can be the cornerstone of an activity escalation plan.
For example, if a lead is assigned to a sales rep, the system can be
instructed to wait for three days before checking to see whether an
appointment has been created. If the system finds no evidence of an
appointment, a message can be automatically sent to the sales rep or
the sales rep’s manager could be notified.
 Wait for Timer: This is similar to Wait for Condition, but this condition
can be used to make sure that an assignment is handled within a speci-
fied time limit. For example, a high-priority tech support call that must
be returned within an hour can be monitored by using Wait for Timer.
Actions
Actions are a series of operations performed after conditions have been eval-
uated as true. Nine activities can be enacted:
 Create activity: This is used to schedule a task, phone call, fax, or
appointment.
 Send e-mail: This powerful utility enables you to send a confirming
e-mail to a customer who has just placed an order or to notify a sales
rep when a lead has just been assigned to him or her.
 Create note: A note can be attached to a record. For example, you could
create a note that places an account on hold when payment becomes
overdue.
 Update entity: You can use the Update Object action to modify individ-
ual fields in records. Many fields in each record are not, by default, dis-
played on the screen. You can use Update Object to modify visible as
well as invisible fields.
102
Part II: Setting the Settings 

 Change status: Different types of records are assigned different types of
status. The Change Status action enables the workflow system to change
a record’s status automatically based on conditions being met.
 Assign entity: Workflow can automatically assign cases to customer ser-
vice reps based on a topic, or it can assign an account to a sales rep
based on a territory. For example, if a customer calls about a malfunc-
tioning transporter, the case can be assigned to Molly, your most experi-
enced customer service rep.
 Post URL: This action sends a web site address of another business to a
data field. For example, when a new account is created, you can post the
web site address in the Web site field.
 Run subprocess: Basically, this is one process or rule calling another
one. By using this technique, you can program a large number of simple
workflow rules, with each rule potentially calling another rule.
 Stop: This brings your process to a halt.
 Call assembly: This option contains any custom .Net assemblies 
that your administrator or implementation partner have registered 
with Microsoft CRM. Refer to the SDK documentation to add your 
own assemblies here.
We hope you now have a definitive and solid base from which to build your
workflow rules. As mentioned, once you get the knack of it, building rules is
fairly simple — after a few weeks, you’ll probably wonder how you managed
without them.

Creating and Using the 
Knowledge Base
In This Chapter
 Preparing your knowledge base
 Creating a knowledge base template
 Creating an article to add to the knowledge base
 Searching through the knowledge base
O
nce upon a time, a person had a dream . . . and that dream was called 
a database. Actually, it was called a library — a giant room filled with
books upon books, information stored in a central location. With the advent
of the computer, such libraries can be stored with much less space and 
transmitted with ease.
Based on templates and articles, Microsoft CRM’s database, or library, is
called the knowledge base (also referred to as KB) and is a powerful model 
for sharing information across your organization and with your customers.
Templates determine how information is formatted, found, and presented.
Articles are the products created when information is applied to a template.
In this chapter, you find out how to create knowledge base templates and
articles. You also discover how to search the knowledge base and associate
relevant information with other sections of Microsoft CRM.
Organizing Information for 
Your Knowledge Base
The key to the knowledge base is organization. So announce a staff meeting
and order pizza, the ultimate brainstorming food, because that’s what this
meeting is about. Brainstorming and organizing your documentation and

processes. If you have a whiteboard (complete with the permanent-marker
line that can’t be removed), make sure you use it to record ideas and
thoughts for the stuff you want to put in the KB, so everyone can keep track
of what’s been brought up. Next, give everyone a notepad, sit them down,
and get ready to organize.
Your task is to take the sales and service documents your company uses and
put them together in some form of order.
Let’s say you have sales documents and service documents. Your sales 
documents could include features and benefits of your products, pricing,
system requirements, availability, delivery timelines, and fancy marketing
advertisements.
On the service side, you have things like schematics, maintenance require-
ments, warranty information, and installation procedures. Ultimately, these
topics become the building blocks for your knowledge base.
Remember to keep your topics and titles in plain, easily discernible language
because, after you’re finished here, you’re going to put all your notes
together in Microsoft CRM to create your company’s knowledge base.
Creating Article Templates
The knowledge base contains articles built on templates. By using templates
for the foundation of a new knowledge base article, all of your company’s
articles will be easy to enter and have a uniform layout, regardless of
whether Jane from Accounting or Clean-o-matic Bob is creating the article.
Microsoft CRM comes with a collection of default article templates: General
Use, Procedure, Question & Answer, Solution to a Problem, and Standard KB
Article, as shown in Figure 9-1. And those of you who like to think outside the
box can create your own templates.
The Procedure template is laid out using a standard format of three sections:
Purpose & Scope, Procedure, and Additional Comments.
Normally, you create a new article within an existing template. But we’re
going to walk you through the creation of a new template, just in case none of
the standard ones fit what you’re looking for. Later in the chapter, you create
a new article based on an existing template

offers one more way (in addition to the title) to describe the template
you’re creating. When you click OK, you return to the Article Template:
New window to design the template.
6. On the right of the Article Template: New window, in the Common

You can add as many sections as you want to the template. These sec-
tions will appear when you create articles (later in this chapter).
9. Click the Save and Close icon in the upper-left corner of the Article
Template: New window.
The window closes, the new template is saved, and you return to the
Article Templates window.
Creating a Knowledge Base Article
The knowledge base acts as the staging area for all your company’s articles.
This is where you store, edit, and publish articles, and also where your staff
finds the finished product.
Imagine that your company doesn’t have an assigned editor and this hap-
pens: Bob from Washing Machines adds an article regarding a quick blurb 
he heard on the news about the competitor’s washing machine. Stan from
Refrigerators adds a comic strip about refrigerator repair guys. Anne from
Accounting adds instructions on placing orders and taking credit cards.
Thomas the CSR adds one about what to do with irate customers. John 
from the mailroom . . . well, you get the picture.
Microsoft takes another step in preventing chaos by enabling your company
to choose who can add articles to and remove articles from templates. We
recommend that you set up this person to also approve articles before they
are published, checking for format, accuracy, and continuity.
The next few pages explain how to create and submit draft articles as well as
approve and publish them. As shown in Figure 9-3, the knowledge base cate-
gorizes articles in one of three stages:
108
Part II: Setting the Settings 

 Draft: Your works-in-progress, that is, composed articles that have not
been submitted for approval and drafts. Drafts are visible only to their
respective authors, and users can’t search for them in the knowledge
base.
 Unapproved: Store your articles pending editor approval here. Users
can’t search for these in the knowledge base.
 Published: Your finished, editor-approved articles ready for the general
public. Published articles are read-only (so they can’t be edited), but
users can search for them in the knowledge base.
Follow these steps to create a new article:
1. In the lower part of the navigation pane, click the Service button.
Then, in the upper part of the pane, select Knowledge Base.
The Knowledge Base window appears (refer to Figure 9-3). You can 
view articles (based on their status) in the main part of the window, 
on the right.
2. In the Knowledge Base window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The KB Template Explorer appears, listing all the templates currently
available in your system. Find the template you created earlier. Template
information (title and type, creator, and description) will appear on the
right of the KB Template Explorer window as you highlight a template.
Figure 9-3:

Chapter 9: Creating and Using the Knowledge Base

3. Highlight your template and click OK.
The Article: New window appears, as shown in Figure 9-4. The sections
and instructions you created earlier appear here.
4. Enter a title.
Required fields are Title and Subject; they must be filled in before you
can save the article.
5. Link the article to a subject.
To do so, click the magnifying glass to the right of the Subject field. The
Look Up a Subject window appears. Use the plus signs to open and col-
lapse the subjects to specify a section within the subject. When you find
your subject, highlight it and click OK.
6. In the Keywords field, enter words that will help your staff find this
article.
Much like a search on the Internet, you can enter words here to search
for articles pertaining to certain subjects. For example, if I were the CSR
on the phone with Mrs. Reynolds and her Hop-n-Pop Toaster, I could
search for settings and this article would show up in my search results.
Separate each of your keywords with a comma. Another suggestion for
your article keywords is the model number of your product.

Part II: Setting the Settings 

7. Click inside the text area and enter your information.
The instructions disappear and you’re ready to type. Microsoft CRM’s
predefined templates are already formatted with specific information.
For example, if we had chosen the Procedure template to create our arti-
cle, the following section headings would be in the template: Purpose &
Scope, Procedure, and Additional Comments. When you created your
template (earlier in the chapter), this is where the sections you created
are used.
The sections allow you to create an easy-to-read, informative article for
your CSRs and your customers. You can write step-by-step instructions,
create question-and-answer scripts, or even make a Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ) section.
Use the toolbar under the Keywords field in the Article: New window to
do basic editing of your article and even add color text for emphasis.
8. Click the Save and Close icon.
The article goes into your Draft folder for further editing and, ultimately,
submission for approval.
Although this publishing process may seem overwhelming and (in some
cases) unnecessary, maintaining the process is important. Carefully manag-
ing information stored in the knowledge base guarantees that you’re provid-
ing the latest, most accurate information to your sales and service staff and,
even more importantly, your customers.
Submitting a draft article
Now is the moment every writer dreads: time to hand over your masterpiece
to the person your company designated as editor (when your business units
were defined in Chapter 6).
To submit a draft article for approval, follow these steps:
1. In the navigation pane, click the Service button. Then in the upper
part of the pane, select Knowledge Base.
The Knowledge Base window appears on the right
2. On the left side of the Knowledge Base window, click the Draft folder
to access your drafts.
3. On the right side of the window, highlight the article you want to
submit.
111
Chapter 9: Creating and Using the Knowledge Base

4. In the Knowledge Base window toolbar, click the Submit button.
The dialog box shown in Figure 9-5 appears.
5. Click OK.
The article you submitted has now moved from the Draft folder to the
Unapproved folder.
You can check that your article has been moved by clicking the Unapproved
folder on the left side of the Knowledge Base window. All the articles pending
editor approval are here. Just a reminder: These are not searchable.
Approving an article
Editors, break out your virtual red ink pens. All those articles in the
Unapproved folder are yours to check, edit, correct, and otherwise 
make your high school English teacher proud (or cry).
Articles in the Unapproved folder can be opened and edited by anyone with

Part II: Setting the Settings 

Follow these steps to approve an article:
1. In the navigation pane, click the Service button and then select
Knowledge Base.
2. On the left side of the Knowledge Base window, click the Unapproved
folder
All the articles awaiting approval are displayed.
3. On the right side of the window, find your article, highlight it, and
double-click to open it.
This opens right to the article itself so you can make changes or return
it to the author. If you make changes, make sure to click Save (the disk
icon) in the upper-left corner of the screen.
4. In the Knowledge Base window toolbar, click Approve.
5. In the confirmation window that appears, click OK.
The Article is automatically moved to the Published folder and is now
searchable in the knowledge base.
In the event you have to reject the article, you would click Reject instead of
Approve in Step 4. You will be given the option to add comments explaining
your rejection in the Provide a Reason dialog box, as shown in Figure 9-6.
Let’s say you’ve approved the article, but a week later, someone finds an
error in it. For example, the Hop-n-Pop toaster’s reddish color isn’t called
Cinnamon. It’s called Beauty Red. In this situation, you (with the appropriate
rights) can unpublish an article. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Click the Published folder in the Knowledge Base window.
2. Click the article you want to unpublish.
Figure 9-6:

Chapter 9: Creating and Using the Knowledge Base

3. Click the Unpublish button.
The article is automatically moved to the Unapproved folder for 
revisions.
Now let’s say you have found an article that is out of date and you need to
delete it. Again, you’ll need the appropriate rights to complete this two-step
process: Unpublish the article first and then delete it.
1. Click the Published folder in the Knowledge Base window.
All published articles are displayed.
2. Click the article you want to unpublish.
3. Click the Unpublish button, and then click OK.
Your article is moved to the Unapproved folder. When you return to the
Published folder, the list will be refreshed automatically.
4. Click the Unapproved folder.
5. Highlight the article you want to delete, and then click the Delete
button.
The Delete Confirmation dialog box appears.
6. Click OK.
Goodbye out-of-date article. The Unapproved folder refreshes 
automatically.
Because all articles and subjects in Microsoft CRM are related, you will be
warned that deleting an article will also cause Microsoft CRM to remove 
any records attached to the article. Normally, this is not a problem because
the only attachment an article can have is to a subject, but we recommend
that you and your staff use the delete feature sparingly. For those of you 
who don’t want to delete the article and start over, you can simply add a
comment to it on the Comments tab in the open article window.
Searching the Knowledge Base
Mrs. Reynolds is on the phone again and you need to find the article you 
read aloud to her last week. Problem is, you don’t remember the article’s
name. That’s right, retreat to your trusty knowledge base and take advantage
of the search function. Like a card catalog in a library, the knowledge base 
is the warehouse of information for your company (as is Abby, the Admin
Assistant).
114
Part II: Setting the Settings 

With Mrs. Reynolds in one ear, here’s how you search the knowledge base:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Workplace button.
2. In the upper part of the navigation pane, select Service and then
select Knowledge Base.
All of your company’s published articles are displayed. You can reach
this section also by clicking the Service button at the bottom of the navi-
gation pane and then selecting Knowledge Base at the top of the pane.
3. On the left side of the Knowledge Base window, click the Search tab.
The Search pane appears, as shown in Figure 9-7.
4. Fill in the following fields to define your search criteria:
• Unlabeled field: Use the drop-down menu in the first field to tell
your search engine which fields to search. Full Text searches the
title, case number, and body of every article. It does not search for
keywords. Keyword searches only the keyword field of every arti-
cle. Title searches the title field of every article. Article Number
searches for a specific article number (probably that number on
the Post-It stuck to the monitor).
Figure 9-7:
Use the
Search
pane to zero
in on the
article you
want.
115
Chapter 9: Creating and Using the Knowledge Base

• Search for: This is where you enter your search words. For our
example with Mrs. Reynolds, you might enter toaster and the model
number. If you remember only part of the model number, you could
use a wildcard character. For example, entering *1138 will return
every article with the numbers 1138 in the field you search.
• In subject: Narrow your search even more by selecting the subject
you want to search. This is especially helpful if you have, say, sev-
eral hundred articles..
• Options: Another drill-down feature, this option allows you to
search for the exact text you entered in Search For or choose a
broader search with Use Like Words. An Exact Text search is
quicker but less forgiving; you’ll need the exact wording to ping the
articles you want. Use Like Words takes longer but allows you
some freedom if you can’t remember whether Mrs. Reynolds has,
say, the Model 1138 or the Model 1138A.
You can use the * wildcard only with Options: Exact Text. Using
the wildcard character with the Use Like Words option results in
an error message.
5. Click the Search button.
All articles that match your search criteria appear on the right side of
the window.
Just a note on searching for articles: When you add a new article to the
knowledge base, you’ll be able to view it from the Published folder, but you
will not be able to search for it until the catalog’s index is updated. Microsoft
CRM does this automatically every 15 minutes (unless your administrator
changes this value).

Setting Up the Product Catalog
In This Chapter
 Understanding the product catalog
 Getting to the Product Catalog screen
 Setting up a discount list
 Creating unit groups
 Formulating your price lists
 Adding products to the catalog
P
roduct catalogs, whether they’re the paper version or a virtual one, are 
a great invention. And product catalogs aren’t just for consumers! They
also make excellent reference tools for your sales and customer service staff.
With Microsoft CRM, your company can create a brawny, capable, all-inclusive
computer-based product catalog. That way, you can quickly and easily find all
the items and services you sell (nix thumbing through pages). This chapter
shows you how to set up this valuable resource.
Overview of the Product Catalog
Within a product catalog, you can create pricing schedules and assign them to
your customers as default schedules. This way, Bob’s Big Discount Warehouse
gets the wholesale pricing schedule, and the National Organization for Toasters
gets nonprofit pricing. Using these assigned pricing schedules and the quote
generation feature of Microsoft CRM (refer to Chapter 18), your salespeople
can generate accurate quotes quickly. Quotes beget orders and orders beget
invoices and invoices beget bucks (most of the time).
You can create a number of pricing schedules, for any reason. These sched-
ules could be as simple as retail, wholesale, and nonprofit pricing or as com-
plex as seasonal pricing or tiered membership pricing. Chapter 18 details
how to create and use the pricing schedule to your company’s advantage.

The product catalog can link to opportunities, competitors, and product liter-
ature. In fact, the product catalog has its tentacles into virtually every aspect
of the system.
If you’re integrating with one of Microsoft’s Dynamics back-office accounting
systems, you set up the product catalog in Dynamics and link to it rather
than setting up the catalog in Microsoft CRM. If you’re integrating with an
accounting system other than Dynamics, you can upload that system’s prod-
uct list directly into the CRM product catalog. When integrating with these
systems, any data from the accounting side normally overrides what you
entered previously in the CRM product catalog.
If you use an accounting application other than one from the Microsoft
Dynamics family, there are solutions for you too. See Chapter 28 for some
add-ons that simplify this work.
It’s a good idea to read the entire chapter before you build your product cata-
log. This will give you an overview and allow you to do some planning.
When you’re ready to start building your product catalog, we recommend
that you use the order suggested by Microsoft, which we follow too:
 Discount lists
 Unit groups
 Price lists
 Products
To start your planning, categorize your products and services and organize
and simplify your pricing schedules. This is also a good time to check 
and update your inventory lists. Take out products you haven’t sold since
President Nixon was in office. And while you’re at it, update your pricing.
Remember, the cost of living has increased considerably since you founded
the company (36 cents for a gallon for gas, anyone?).
Getting to the Product Catalog Window
You create a product catalog in the Product Catalog window of Microsoft
CRM. You won’t have to venture out of this section while creating your cata-
log — though we recommend venturing out of your cubicle for a leg stretch
once in a while.
118
Part II: Setting the Settings 

Now that you’ve stretched your legs and shared the latest rumor, it’s time to
get to work. Start by going to the Product Catalog window, as follows:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click Settings.
The Settings window for all Microsoft CRM functions appears on the
right.
2. In the Settings window, click Product Catalog.
The four components of the product catalog appear in the Product
Catalog window.
As mentioned, we recommend that you create your product catalog in the
order that Microsoft indicates. So that’s what you do next.
Creating a Discount List
Discount lists control how prices change based on the quantity of the product
or service being purchased. You can set your discounts in two ways:
 By percentage
 By reduction according to a set dollar amount
For example, a seasonal sale in which you offer a 10 percent discount on all
purchases calls for a percent discount list. Offering $5 off for every touch-
down the high school team makes during the weekend game is a set dollar
amount discount.
To set up a discount list, you first need to get the Product Catalog window, as
explained in the preceding section. Then follow these steps:
1. In the Product Catalog window, click Discount Lists.
All existing discount lists are displayed, as shown in Figure 10-1.
2. In the Discount Lists window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Create Discount List window appears.
3. In the Name field, enter a title for your new discount list.
We recommend a unique and self-explanatory title so that others will be
able to identify the list. In our example, we entered “Summer Special
Discount.”
4. Choose the type of discount that you want to offer your customers.
The Percentage option is based on a percentage of the regular price. The
Amount option is based on a set dollar amount deducted from the regu-
lar price. To follow along with our example, select Percentage.
119
Chapter 10: Setting Up the Product Catalog

5. Click OK.
The Information window for your new discount list appears. (The top of
the navigation pane has two options: Information and Discounts. The
Information display is the default display.) Note the top of the window;
whatever you named your discount list appears here.
At this point, you can continue with creating the discount list, or you
can exit the discount list by clicking Save and Close.
6. Enter a note for the discount list.
For example, you can add a note about the limitations of the discount
(such as “limit 4”).
7. In the navigation pane, select Discounts.
The Discount section of your discount list appears, as shown in Figure
10-2. This is where you begin entering the details for this discount. 
8. Now to make your discounts: Click the New Discount button on the
toolbar.
9. In the Discount: New window that appears, enter the following infor-
mation for your discount:
a. The beginning and ending quantity: The program calls these
Begin Quantity and End Quantity.
b. Your discount amount: If you chose Percentage in Step 4, this line
will say Percentage. If you chose Amount in Step 5, this line will say
Amount ($). When entering the amount, don’t enter the symbol 
(% or $).
Figure 10-1:
Start
building
your
discount
lists here.
120
Part II: Setting the Settings 

10. Click the Save and Close button to return to your discount list.
11. To enter another line item, go back to Step 8.
You can enter as many line items as you want to establish the necessary
price breaks for this discount list. For example, if you want to offer price
breaks for quantity purchases, you might create a line item for a dis-
count for 1–10 items purchased and another one to assign a price for
11–20 items.
12. To save this list, click Save and Close in the Discount List window.
Make sure that you don’t overlap quantity ranges. For example, suppose your
first discount covers the first nine items sold, and you have a larger discount
for ten items and above. You enter 1-9 for the first discount and 10-99 for the
second discount. But what if you sell time and break it down in 15-minute
increments? The undefined quantity between 9 and 10 could be an issue. We
suggest that you break down time increments into decimals when entering
quantities for time.
Creating a Unit Group
A base unit is the smallest or most common means of tracking an item sold.
Typical base units are pounds, gallons, hours, days, and tons.
Figure 10-2:
The
discount
workspace
of your
discount list.
121
Chapter 10: Setting Up the Product Catalog

A unit group defines how individual items are grouped into larger quantities.
For example, suppose that you sell books individually, by the case, and by
the pallet. A unit group of books shows how a book relates to a case and a
case to a pallet. Using this example, if you sell 2 cases of books, with 20
books to a case, the system knows that you sold 40 books.
To create a unit group, follow these steps:
1. In the Product Catalog window, click Unit Groups.
If you need help finding the window, see the earlier section titled
“Getting to the Product Catalog Window.” The screen shown in 
Figure 10-3 appears.
2. In the window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Create Unit Group dialog box appears.
3. Enter the following information for your unit group:
a. Name: The name of your unit group. For our example, we’re calling
this unit group Books.
b. Primary Unit: This is the smallest unit by which the product can
be sold. The primary unit is also known as the base unit.
4. Click OK.
The Information window, which is the default display, appears.
Figure 10-3:
This is your
main Unit
Groups
display.
122
Part II: Setting the Settings 

5. At the top of the navigation pane on the left, click Units.
The Unit Group: Books window appears. (If you named your unit some-
thing else, that name would appear instead of Books.) This is where
you’ll add your units to your unit group.
6. In the toolbar of your new Unit Group, click New Unit.
The Unit: New window appears.
7. For each of the three units (book, case, and pallet), do the following:
a. Enter the name.
This is where you enter the name of each unit. To follow along with
the example, enter Book (the first time through), then Case, and
then Pallet.
b. Enter the quantity.
Again, to follow along with the example, enter a quantity of 1 for
Each because this is our base unit. The Case quantity is 20, mean-
ing that each case contains 20 base units. The Pallet quantity is 10,
meaning that each pallet contains 10 cases.
c. Enter the base unit.
The base unit is the smallest increment of this new unit you are
creating. Continuing with the example, you can see that Each has
no base unit (because it is the base unit and was determined in
Step 3 to be the Primary Unit). Case has a base unit of Each, and
Pallet has a base unit of Case. Use the magnifying glass to browse
for the unit you want to set as the base unit. All units, with the
exception of the primary unit, must have a base unit.
d. Click the Save and Close button.
A quick note for those keeping score: The columns in the Unit Group
workspace are listed in a different order than those in the Unit: New
window.
8. Click the Save and Close button.
You are returned to the unit group you are working on, as shown in
Figure 10-4.
9. To save the unit group, click the Save and Close button again.

Chapter 10: Setting Up the Product Catalog

Creating a Price List
Price lists are the backbone of all your opportunities and quotes. Your com-
pany may have more than one price list, such as a retail price list and a
wholesale one. You could also have separate price lists for government and
nonprofit customers. You can add a default price list to each contact or
account, but this can be overridden when you create quotes and invoices
(see Chapter 18).
Here’s how you create that price list:
1. In the Product Catalog window, click Price Lists.
The Price Lists window shown in Figure 10-5 appears.
2. In the window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Price List: New window appears. The navigation pane displays two
choices: Information and Price List Items. Price List Items is not avail-
able until you’ve saved the price list.
3. Enter a name for your price list.
Required fields are in red. The Name field is required, but the start and
end date fields are not. In our example, we created the “It’s Too Cold!!
price list to offer special prices to match the dropping temperatures.
However, winter lasts only so long, so we’ve set the price specials to 
end in February.
Figure 10-4:
We’ve

Part II: Setting the Settings 

4. Click Save (the disk icon next to the Save and Close button).
Clicking Save allows you to continue with the next part of the process,
adding price list items. However, if you aren’t ready to enter your price
list items or need to get out of this window for some reason, just click
the Save and Close button.
5. In the navigation pane on the left, click Price List Items.
6. On the Price List Items toolbar, click the Add Price List Item button.
The Price List Item: New window appears, as shown in Figure 10-6.
7. Enter your price list information in the available fields.
Some fields must be filled in by using the magnifying glass to the right of
the field. The magnifying glass opens a Look Up window. Other fields can
be filled in freehand or by using the drop-down boxes. As with other
screens in Microsoft CRM, the fields in red are required.
a. Price List: This is filled in automatically by the program. However,
you can change the price list using the magnifying glass.
b. Product: Use the magnifying glass to find the product you want in
this price list. Microsoft thwarts the Minions of Chaos by allowing
your staff to enter only predefined choices from the product list.
c. Unit: Use the magnifying glass to make your selection. This field is
not enabled until you select a product.
Figure 10-5:
Manage
and create
your price

125
Chapter 10: Setting Up the Product Catalog

d. Discount List (optional): Use the magnifying glass to find the dis-
count list you created earlier in the chapter and link it to your
price list. By adding a discount list to work in tandem with the
price list item, your staff can create thorough pricing to quote your
customers. (See Chapter 18 for details on generating quotes.)
e. Quantity Selling Option: This is where you define the quantities
your product will be sold in. Choose No Control, Whole, or Whole
and Fractional. This feature really comes in handy if you sell frac-
tional services such as help desk or prorated time products.
f. Pricing Method: Six options are available: Currency Amount;
Percent of List; Percent Markup — Current Cost; Percent Margin —
Current Cost; Percent Markup — Standard Cost; Percent Margin —
Standard Cost.
g. Amount ($): Enter the dollar amount for the price list. The Amount
option is available only if you chose Currency Amount under
Pricing Method. Don’t include a dollar sign.
h. Percentage: Enter the percentage for the price list. Don’t include
the symbol (%).
i. Rounding Policy: Your rounding policy tells the system how to
round percentage calculations to arrive at a specific price. Your
options are None, Up, Down, and To Nearest. Rounding applies only
when the pricing method is based on percentage. If you selected
Currency Amount for the Pricing Method, this field is not available.
Figure 10-6:
Enter the
information
about your
item here.
126
Part II: Setting the Settings 

j. Rounding Option: This option works with the Rounding Amount
field. For example, select Ends In here and .00 in the Rounding
Amount field if you want to round to the nearest dollar. Select
Multiple Of here and enter .05 in the Rounding Amount field to
round to the nearest nickel. If you selected None for the Rounding
Policy or Currency Amount for the Pricing Method, this field is 
not available.
k. Rounding Amount: Fill in the amount on which you want to base
your rounding, as described in the preceding entry. If you selected
None for the Rounding Policy or Currency Amount for the Pricing
Method, this field is not available.
8. Click Save and Close to save your price list items to your price list.
As mentioned, the fields in red are required. If you’ve missed one (due to
excessive caffeine intake or hunting down who burned the popcorn), the
program will remind you.
By creating price lists, you build an easy-to-use system to generate price
quotes for your customers. Microsoft CRM uses the price lists, discount lists,
and price list items to automatically calculate client costs, so your salespeo-
ple can focus on selling and not math.
If your company uses an accounting system and wants to integrate it with
Microsoft CRM, keep in mind that the interface will normally provide all this
information and will overwrite your price lists with the information from the
accounting system. With the integration provided to Microsoft CRM, much 
of this functionality is disabled because it is controlled by the accounting
application.
Adding Products
Your products — without them, you wouldn’t have a business, right? From
the first entrepreneurial caveman, businesses are made because someone
had a product to sell. We use the term product as a general term to encom-
pass products, services, the help desk — basically whatever you build your
business around.
Now, because the Minions of Chaos love mischief, Microsoft has taken a
smart step in preventing them from running amok in your system: Only
system administrators are allowed to add new products. That means if Sam
the Salesman can’t find the entry for the Hop-n-Pop toaster, he won’t be able
to add entries that could create confusion when you want a report or when
other salespeople are looking for the Hop-n-Pop. Can you imagine if he added
the product as hopnpop, Mary in the next cube added it as HnP, and then
Carey added it by the model number X900? How could you run a report on
how many of those have been sold?
127
Chapter 10: Setting Up the Product Catalog

Another function of Microsoft CRM allows you to group products to be sold
as a kit. Take your Hop-n-Pop toaster, sell it with bagels and organic pre-
serves, and you have the Bagel Buff Gift Basket. You could also create special
kits to simplify your sales and ordering processes or to get rid of some stuff
that you don’t want anymore — clearance, anyone?
You can also relate individual products to substitute products. This is a
handy function for your salespeople when Mrs. Reynolds wants a Hop-n-Pop
toaster, but you sold the last one two days ago. By relating this product to a
substitute, your salesperson can easily recommend the equivalent
HotHopPop toaster.
If you’re a system administrator, follow these steps to add a new product to
your product list:
1. In the Product Catalog window, click Products.
A list of your active products appears, as shown in Figure 10-7.
2. In the Products window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Product: New window appears with three tabs, as shown in 
Figure 10-8.
3. Fill in the General tab.
Figure 10-7:
The active
products
screen.
128
Part II: Setting the Settings 

The General tab, which is the default tab, is where you’ll enter most of the
information for your product. You can fill in some fields freeform, others
using the magnifying glass (thwarting those Minions of Chaos), and still
others with the Form Assistant. (In Figure 10-8, the Form Assistant has
been collapsed. To open it, click where indicated in the figure.) For details
on using the magnifying glass and the Form Assistant, see Chapter 2.
The following fields are mandatory:
a. ID: If your system is integrated with your accounting system, the
ID is the item number used by the accounting system. It is through
this field that the accounting system updates (and overwrites)
information in each product record.
b. Name: This is descriptive text entered freehand. But it can also be
populated by your accounting system if it is integrated.
c. Unit Group: If your system is not integrated with accounting,
select the unit group that includes the units by which this product
will be sold.
d. Default Unit: This is the unit you would typically sell the product
as. For example, if you sold the book, Toasting the Night Away, as a
single product, the default unit would be Each. If you were selling
nails, the default unit might be Box.
Click to open the Form Assistant
Figure 10-8:

129
Chapter 10: Setting Up the Product Catalog

e. Default Price List: Earlier in the chapter, we discussed price lists.
This field relates an individual product to a default price list
(wholesale, retail, dealer, government, and the like) you’ve set up.
When salespeople go to make that quote, they’ll actually get the
price list attached to the customer record. However, if no price 
list is attached to the customer record, the system defaults to 
the price list indicated for the product itself. You can’t assign a
default price list to the product until you save the product (use 
the Save button rather than the Save and Close button) and associ-
ate the product with a price list item. Until you do this, you see a
warning message that the default price list has not been set.
f. Decimals Supported: If your product (books, for example) can’t be
divided into fractional quantities, enter 0. If fractional quantities
are possible, you can use up to five decimal places.
The following fields are optional, but we find them helpful in building a
product catalog and entering products:
a. Subject: This field allows you to group your products for reporting.
b. Product Type: The four default product types are Sales Inventory
(usually physical goods); Miscellaneous Charges (fees, such as for
restocking); Services (such as consulting or annual maintenance
fees); and Flat Fee (for example, handling or shipping charges).
c. Quantity on Hand: The number of items in stock. This field is con-
trolled by the back-office system if you have integrated it.
d. URL: The Web address related to this product. This is a handy
place to get up-to-date product information.
e. List Price, Standard Cost, and Current Cost: The price on a gener-
ated quote is based on these fields.
4. On the Description tab, you can enter vendor and part number 
information.
Having the vendor and part information can be helpful, especially if you
sell similar products with similar names. Entering information on this
tab isn’t mandatory, but it does offer you another opportunity to identify
your product.
5. The Notes tab is for freeform notes and information about your product.
Suppose that your product comes in other colors. Instead of making the
salesperson back up a few screens to see what colors you offer, you can
list the colors here too.
6. After you’ve entered all your product information, click Save and
Close to return to your product catalog (refer to Figure 10-7).
Remember the motto of computer users everywhere: save, Save, SAVE!
Ta-dah! Now you’ve entered your product into your product catalog! Give
yourself a pat on the back.

 Exporting to Excel
“W
here’s my report?!” How many times do you hear that one! Or this
one: “I need that report yesterday, Smith!!” Microsoft CRM has a
huge set of built-in reports. Those report-happy folks (every office has at
least one) will be in seventh heaven, especially when they discover that they
can also design custom reports in SQL Reporting Services or Microsoft Excel
and add them to Microsoft CRM. For those upgrading from the older 1.0 or
1.2 versions, which used Crystal Reports as the primary reporting engine,
Microsoft includes options for system administrators to upgrade their
Crystal Reports. Your consultant or value-added reseller can help you 
with this.
To some, reporting is an art form; creating appropriate reports to view activi-
ties, details, and dollars across the database is to them what painting was to
Vincent van Gogh (with the exception of that whole ear thing, thank good-
ness). For management folks, reporting is even more compelling, because
they can slice and dice to get a detailed picture of who’s selling and serving
and who’s not.
On the flip side, reports can do a lot for your sales staff. Say they have ten
phone calls to make that day and a report on their prospects to prepare.
Which would you rather have them do? Sell. Yes, we thought so too. Right
there is where Microsoft CRM reporting functions pay off. Instead of wasting
time fiddling with the report, your sales staff can come up with a report in a
few clicks and spend the rest of their time selling. Of course, the report has
to be set up ahead of time, but you get the picture.

In this chapter, we show you how Microsoft CRM organizes its many reports
and how you can customize the data and the report appearance. We also go
over exporting and printing your reports.
Identifying Report Categories
Microsoft CRM contains predefined reports and charts separated into four
major categories — sales, service, administrative, and marketing. Each of
these categories contains reports that display information related to that
specific area of Microsoft CRM. Keep in mind that some reports can be
hidden from certain users, depending on their security roles, and some are
just not assigned to a category or entity:
 Sales reports: Collect all the activities associated with a sale, from the
lead through the actual sale. These reports can also provide statistical
information about accounts, lead sources, competitors, and products.
 Service reports: Provide statistical information related to contracts and
cases and summaries of knowledge base articles. These reports provide
quick analyses of which products require the most support and where
your service representatives are spending the most time.
 Administrative reports: Provide summary information about your
Microsoft CRM users. This section is a logical place to store custom
reports related to company-wide information, such as a list of all
employees who participate in your 401(k) plan.
 Marketing reports: Describe accounts, campaigns, lead source effect-
iveness, and other areas of interest to the marketing department. The
reports provide summary and detail information across accounts, 
campaigns, and lead sources.
Your system administrator, consultant, or value-added reseller can create
custom reports and can make a report available in one or more categories,
as well as from forms for related record types or from lists for related record
types.
Reports can also be assigned to an entity (case, contact, account, activity,
and so on) and may be viewed from that entity by clicking the Reports button
on the toolbar. Entity options are listed in the “Accessing Reports” section.
If your security profile prevents you from accessing data in Microsoft CRM,
you will not be able to see that data in any report you run. The reporting fea-
ture respects security settings.

Accessing Reports
“Where’s my report!?” “Coming right up!” Now you can say that with confi-
dence because it won’t take you long to bring that report up.
Remember, however, that the settings in your security profile determine
which reports you can see. This is another area where Microsoft CRM stands
out, by allowing you to set up multilayered security access for your staff. 
For example, you can give only your Human Resources department access 
to reports containing confidential information such as salaries and commis-
sion rates. Or perhaps your system administrators could restrict access to
resource-intensive reports to keep the reports from being launched by mis-
take during the day, when the system is already busy.
Next up, how to access reports.
You can access reports in the Reports window or, for those reports linked to
specific entities as noted, from within the entities.
We also touch on how to drill down the report search results (which comes
in handy for those needle-in-the-haystack searches.
1. At the bottom of the Navigation pane, click the Workplace button.
Then, at the top of the pane, click Reports (under My Work).
The Reports window appears, as shown in Figure 11-1. Remember, you’ll
see only the reports that your security profile allows you to see.

2. Fill in the Look For box and click the Find button.
This is the first method we’re using to reduce the size of the list. By
entering text in the Look For box, only reports with that text anywhere
in the display (that is, in the Report Name, Report Type, Modified On, 
or Description column) will be listed.
3. Click the arrow next to the Category box and select a category.
This is another way of narrowing the reports listed and comes in handy
if you’re a report-heavy company.
4. Click the arrow next to the Entity box and select an entity.
Choosing an entity allows you to find reports connected to that entity.
You can choose from accounts, cases, campaign responses, marketing
lists, quotes, and more.
5. When you find the report you’re looking for, click it to highlight it.
6. To run the report you just highlighted, click More Actions in the
window’s toolbar and choose Run Report.
This opens the Report Viewer screen, where you’ll see a notification that
your report is generating. Then you see the report itself. Figure 11-2 is an
example of one report.
Figure 11-2:

134
Part II: Setting the Settings 

You can also view reports from inside an entity. For example, click Workplace
in the navigation pane and then click Contacts under Customers. In the
Contacts window, click the Reports icon. In the drop-down list, choose
Records by Contact, or choose Run Report to go to the Report Viewer 
screen (refer to Figure 11-2). If you choose Records by Contact, you’ll be
asked to select the records in a dialog window before continuing.
Report Filtering
Let’s say you have your report, but even though you chose a category and 
an entity, you still have too much information. By using filters, you can cus-
tomize and narrow down that information to make a report that shows only
the information you want.
You can set filtering options by clicking the Edit Filter button at the top of the
Report Viewer screen (refer to Figure 11-2). This gives you the option to edit
your original filter criteria or add new criteria to the filter.
So, using the account distribution report (part of the Sales category), let’s
see how to filter a report:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Workplace button.
Then, at the top of the pane, select Reports (under My Work).
2. In the Reports window, double-click the Account Distribution report.
The Report Viewer: Account Distribution window appears, as shown in
Figure 11-3. The Report Filtering Criteria section has two subsections
(Accounts and Opportunities), where you can enter values. In some
other reports, this area may be blank or may have different options.
If you click Help in the main menu and choose Help on This Page, you
get a description of this report, where the data comes from in Microsoft
CRM, suggestions for ways to use the report, and how to handle prob-
lems with the report.
3. Click the Edit Filter button (in the upper-right corner of the screen) to
display the filter criteria.
A criteria selection area pops up in the workspace of the Report Viewer
window.
4. Edit the filter.
To do so, place the cursor on the first field to select the option and click
once to display all the categories your company uses. What you see in
the remaining two fields depends on what you choose in the first field.
135
Chapter 11: Running Reports

5. Click the Run Report button (at the bottom of the screen).
This opens the Report Viewer screen (the report itself and the editing
screen are both called Report Viewer), which shows the new, filtered
results. The next steps involve detailed filter editing, so you can either
read on or skip to the next section, “Using Viewing Options.” If you want
to continue in this section, continue to Step 6.
6. Click the Edit Filter button again.
This expands the level of detail for editing, as shown in Figure 11-4. You
enter data into the fields exactly as you did in Step 4. However, you now
see arrows to the left of the line items, and you see a new option called
Select.
7. In the first line below the Clear button, click the arrow to open a
drop-down menu and choose Hide in Simple Mode (to follow along
with the example).
As shown in Figure 11-4, (Hidden) pops up on the far right.
8. Click the Hide Details button.
You return to the Report viewer screen (refer to Figure 11-3), but the
Accounts area has disappeared. To get it back, click the Edit Filter
button, click the arrow below the Clear button, and choose Show in
Simple Mode.

9. For practice, let’s group and ungroup some of the options.
a. Use the Select option to select two or more rows.
b. Click the Group AND or the Group OR button.
AND means that all the lines must be true (this is the default if you
do no grouping). OR means that any one of these lines must be
true. This allows you to build sophisticated logical expressions.
c. Click the arrow inside the AND or OR box and see your further
options.
d. Click Ungroup.
Be careful when selecting criteria. If you set up the filter to look for a
record with the owner as, for example, Bob AND Stanley, you’ll get zero
results because a record can’t have two owners. You’d want to use OR in
this case.
10. In the Accounts section, click Select, click the arrow to the right of the
box to open the drop-down box, and choose a field from Accounts.
The Select list under the Opportunities section will give you different
options. The drop-down box will not appear until you mouse over or
click the word Select.
11. Click the condition drop-down list, select Equals, and then click the
arrow to the right of the box.
Take a look at the other options here to get an idea of the kinds of filter-
ing you can perform.
Figure 11-4:
You’ll see
this filtering
ability again

Chapter 11: Running Reports

12. To continue adding conditions, click Select again and repeat the
process.
As an exercise, click Select again and scroll down to the Related section
(under the bold Related header) to see the separate lists of items related
to the Accounts list. Select one of them to create a new section. Then
click the arrow to the left of that section and delete it.
The Clear button in the Edit Details screen in the Report Viewer clears all the
changes you made and returns the filter to its original state. This way, you
save a step by not having to close the filtered version of the report and
reopen the full version.
After showing you all the great things that Microsoft CRM can do, we hate to
bring up bad news, but this is something you have to know. Microsoft CRM
does not save filters. However, there is an add-on product that will save filter
criteria, as we describe it in Chapter 28.
Using Viewing Options
Okay. You have your spiffy report, built with your new filter, and now you
want to look at that baby. You want to customize it, giving it the virtual 
equivalent of a metallic flame job. At the top of each report window (see
Figure 11-5) are the tools you can use to customize the report.
Let’s take a look at all those options:
 Display: Choose to display Activity Count or Activity Duration.
 Group By: Sort your report by these options, such as by day, month,
user, or status. 
Figure 11-5:

Part II: Setting the Settings 

 Page navigation: If your report has more than one page, you can move
through using these VCR-type controls. From left to right, the first
button (First Page) takes you to page one of the report. The next button
(Previous Page) takes you back one page from the page currently dis-
played. The third button (Next Page) takes you to the next page. The last
button (Last Page) takes you to the last page of the report. The display
between the second and third button tells you the page you’re on and
the total page count.
 Display size: Next to the navigation options is a box showing the size of
the display. Click the arrow for the drop-down box to modify the size of
the report.
 Find|Next: This field enables you to search for specific text in the report.
You can use * as a wildcard to search partial text. (For example, typing
Mart* will find Martin.) Just fill in the Find field and click Find. You’ll be
taken to the first result. To move to the second result, click Next.
If the text you enter in the Find field appears in the report on a page pre-
vious to the one you’re viewing on the screen, the search will come up
empty. So, when conducting a search using the Find field, always jump to
the first page of the report before clicking Find.
 Report-specific parameters: Below the main options line, there may be a
row containing report-specific options. The labels for the fields and the
field arrows should explain the use of each field. At the right of the main
options area is a button with two chevrons. This is a toggle that shows
and hides these parameters.
You can drill down on summary reports (or graphs) to see the underly-
ing detail. For example, if you opened the Case Summary Table report,
you’d see a table with summary data for each user. If you click one of the
summary items, you get a detailed line-item breakout. Click the Original
Report button at the top of the screen to return to the summary report.
Exporting and Printing Your Report
Exporting report data is just what it sounds like — the movement of data
from inside Microsoft CRM to outside Microsoft CRM. Let’s look at exporting
your spiffy report.
Printing is a form of exporting. To print your report, just click the little
printer icon in the line above the report. You’ll get the basic Print dialog
window, where you can make the usual selections.
139
Chapter 11: Running Reports

For the most part, when we use the term export in this business, it’s describ-
ing sending the data to another application. In Microsoft CRM’s case, the 
data doesn’t export to just Microsoft products. You can create your report 
in HTML (good for display on your company web site) or export it to an
Adobe Acrobat file.
Follow these steps to export a report:
1. With the report on the screen in the Report Viewer window, click the
arrow by the Export box, and select the application from the drop-
down list.
Your choices are HTML, Excel, Web Archive, Acrobat, TIFF, CSV (comma
delimited), and XML.
2. Click the word Export.
You see a familiar screen, asking whether you want to open the file or
save it to disk. Your computer thinks you’re downloading a file from a
Web site; so you’re asked whether you want to open it or save it. If you
choose to open it, you will have the option to save it from the report
window.
3. Decide whether to open or save the file, and then click OK.
After a moment, your report opens in the format you selected.
When you select one of the export formats, the associated application opens
and displays the report. Interestingly, no matter which selection you make,
the report opens in a browser window (remember that Microsoft CRM is
browser based). So, for example, if you select Microsoft Excel as the export
format, the report opens in what looks like Excel, but it’s inside a browser. 
All of Word’s menus will be available.
Microsoft CRM uses SQL Server 2000 Reporting Services as its primary
reporting tool (replacing Crystal Reports in Version 1.2) If you want to create
your own custom reports, you must install (and learn) SQL Server or work
with your consultant or value-added reseller to help you create reports.
Exporting Records to Excel
In our officer manager’s opinion, Microsoft Excel is right up there with Velcro
and peanut butter. What’s more, it is easy to use but can still handle tons of
data. We think it’s the best way to create quick and efficient reports, whether
those reports are static worksheets, dynamic worksheets, or pivot tables
(consult your friendly Microsoft Excel For Dummies for more on Excel).
140
Part II: Setting the Settings 

Dynamic worksheets offer some big advantages, mostly because you don’t
have to re-enter data and run the risk of making mistakes. When a worksheet
is dynamic, the data in Excel changes automatically every time that same
data is updated in Microsoft CRM. Another advantage is that if you share 
that report, Microsoft Excel checks with CRM and adjusts the content of 
the document based on the security rights of the user running the report.
To export your report to Excel, follow these steps:
1. Go to an area in Microsoft CRM that shows a workspace (or listing).
2. Click the Export to Excel icon.
The Export Data to Excel dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-6.
3. Choose one of the following:
• Static worksheet with records from this page: Select All records
on current page or Records from all pages in the current view
(10,000 records at a time is the maximum export limit). Then click
Export. This simply gives you an Excel worksheet with the same
data in the columns as appears in the Microsoft CRM grid.
• Dynamic PivotTable or Dynamic worksheet: Click the Select
Columns button (for Dynamic PivotTable) or the Edit Columns
button (for the Dynamic worksheet option). In the dialog box that
appears, choose the columns you want in your report and then
click OK. You return to the Export Data to Excel dialog window.
Click Export. You are asked whether you want to save or open the
report. If you choose Save, you can save the file and then open 
it. If you choose Open, you can later save the report after it’s
opened. The report is generated in Microsoft Excel format (in a
web browser window), and the Query Refresh dialog box appears
with the following choices: Enable Automatic Refresh or Disable
Automatic Refresh (Figure 11-7). After you make your choice, you
have access to the report.

Voilà! Isn’t that report pretty? Now when you hear your boss bellow “Where’s
my report?” you can proudly offer your masterpiece. The next step is to show
your boss how invaluable you are by arranging the data so you’re the only
one who can interpret it.
Seriously, as you can see, the reporting function of Microsoft CRM is a full-on,
serious tool that can analyze loads of data and provide, at your demand,
accurate captures of data, products, clients, and more.

In This Chapter
 Writing an announcement
 Checking announcements
A
nnouncements are internal messages that you can put into everyone’s
workspace in Microsoft CRM. Let’s say you want to announce the
upcoming maintenance and downtime planned for the system, or the yearly
company picnic, or that Bob’s wife just had her baby. Creating an announce-
ment in Microsoft CRM is how you would inform everyone in your company.
You don’t even have to be an IT guy to do this.
Creating an Announcement
So, you want to announce the meeting with the IRA/401(k) representative, or
maybe your company is hosting a blood drive. In this section, we show you
how you can let everyone know using Microsoft CRM (with the exception of
the actual wording — that you have to do yourself!). Take a look at the follow-
ing steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Settings button. Then,
at the top of the pane, select Announcements.
The Announcements window appears, as shown in Figure 12-1.
2. In the Announcement window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Announcement: New window appears, as shown in Figure 12-2. The
Title and Body fields are required. (Remember, anything bold in the pic-
tures or red on your screen is a required field.) The More Information
URL and the Expiration Date fields are optional.

Figure 12-2:

one!
Figure 12-1:

144
Part II: Setting the Settings 

3. Fill in the Title field.
4. In the body field, type the announcement.
Remember, what you put in the body is what will go out to everyone.
5. In the More Information URL field, you can enter a web site where
your staff can go for more information.
For example, let’s say you’re announcing the annual American Red Cross
blood drive. You can include the Web site of the Red Cross here.
6. Set the expiration date for the announcement.
This tells Microsoft CRM when to remove the announcement from the
system, therefore doing a bit of housekeeping. You can enter the date
free-form or use the calendar at the end of the field. You can also delete
the announcement manually, as described in a moment.
7. When you’re finished, click the Save and Close button
Remember, the Minions of Chaos are lurking out there, so make sure you save!
To delete an announcement manually, simply highlight it and then click the
black X in the toolbar. You will be prompted to confirm the deletion. Just
click OK and it’s gone.
You can preview the first few lines of each announcement. Click the right-
pointing arrow at the far-left side of the entry in the Announcements 
window. A small drop-down window appears with the first few lines of 
the announcement.
Viewing Announcements
All right, let’s go to the flip side. You’re Bob the sales guy, and you want to
check the announcements because you want to include a screen shot of the
birth announcement for little Eunique’s baby book. Or maybe you were
jawing about the company picnic at the scuttlebutt (that’s water fountain for
you civilians), but no one could remember the date and you want to check.
Here’s how you view announcements:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Workplace button.
2. At the top of the pane, choose Announcements under My Work.
The Announcements options should be at the bottom of the My Work
choices.
145
Chapter 12: Sending Announcements

The My Work section might be collapsed, depending on the work you’re
doing. If it is, simply click the plus sign beside My Work to open the 
section.
3. Read the announcements (see Figure 12-3).
See? It’s simple to create announcements in Microsoft CRM. Plus, this sure
beats an overloaded corkboard in the lunch room. We recommend you save
that spot for Federal notices that must be posted in conspicuous places.

Managing Sales

In this part . . .
T
his part deals with the sales side of your organization.
CRM has four types of customer records: leads,
opportunities, accounts, and contacts. This part explains
all four and shows you how to enter and manage them. 
Activities, which are tasks such as appointments and
phone calls, are associated with each of these record
types, and are discussed in Chapter 14. Managing sales
quotas and forecasts is the turf for any sales organization
and is detailed in Chapter 15.
E-mailing to prospects and to customers is detailed in
Chapter 16. Leads and opportunities, near and dear to
every salesperson, are discussed in Chapter 17. As an
opportunity matures to a closed deal, you need to know
about generating quotes, orders, and invoices — and
these are the topics in Chapter 18. 
Setting up what is essentially a knowledge base of sales lit-
erature and tracking your competition are both covered in
Chapter 19, followed by a discussion of documenting
everything you do with notes and attachments.

Chapter 13
Working with Accounts 
and Contacts
In This Chapter
 Adding accounts — and subaccounts
 Finding information on your accounts
 Assigning accounts
 Adding contacts
A
ccount and contact records, as well as related lead and opportunity
records, hold much of the primary information that your team has or
will collect. Depending on the nature of your business, you may use one or
both types of records. Microsoft CRM continually refers to accounts, con-
tacts, and customers, so it’s important to keep the terms straight. Accounts
are companies, contacts are people, and customers can be either companies 
or people.
Assuming for the moment that you sell to other businesses and that you 
use account records, you’ll also need to use contact records. Each account
record can have multiple people (contact records) associated with it. The
larger the account, the more people you likely need to track.
If you sell only to individuals, you may never actually use account records to
track your customers. In all likelihood, however, you will want to track more
than just your customers in Microsoft CRM. For example, keeping track of your
company’s vendors in the same database is useful. Your competitors may also
be candidates for their own account records if you don’t create actual competi-
tor records for them. If you are strictly a B2C company, you will probably still
encounter situations like these where you need the account record.
In this chapter, we describe how you add new accounts and contacts and
how best to use and access those records after you create them.

Adding and Editing Accounts 
and Subaccounts
The first step in getting started with CRM is to stock it with all the organiza-
tions and people you deal with. If you already have the information organized
in data files (in Excel, other CRM systems, or accounting data files, for exam-
ple), you will be doing some importing. If the data is stored in your head (or,
worse, someone else’s head), you’re in for some typing. The basic entities
into which this data will go are accounts and contacts.
As mentioned, accounts are companies. Subaccounts may be divisions of the
main company or separate physical locations of the same company. Any-
thing you add in Microsoft CRM, you can edit. And anything you add can be
deleted, but a better practice is to deactivate an account rather than delete
it. Deactivating an account is like making it go dormant. If you deactivate an
account, you can always resurrect the information later if you discover you
need it. Deletion is forever.
Old-timers who used Version 1 may be looking for the Quick Create function —
the lazy person’s way to create new records using only required fields. This
function has bitten the dust in Version 3.
Every account you add will almost always be associated with one or more
contacts (people), so you will find it easier to create the contact records
before you create the account record. You can then easily link the two.
Account records and their four sections
You can get to your account records from each of the three application mod-
ules and even from the Workplace. In each of those modules, Accounts
appears up at the top of the navigation pane.
Each account record has four related tabs: General, Details, Administration,
and Notes. You can access these tabs, or create a new account, as follows:
1. At the top of the navigation pane, select Accounts.
The Accounts window appears on the right.
2. In the window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Account: New window appears, as shown in Figure 13-1.
150
Part III: Managing Sales 

The General tab
The General tab has most of the critical contact information for your
account, including the required field Account Name. Most of the fields 
on the General tab are self-explanatory, but the other three tabs deserve 
a little discussion.
When filling in data fields in the various tabs, you could click the Save and
Close button when you’ve finished with each tab. But you can often save
some steps by just clicking Save (the disk icon), which activates related
actions on the navigation pane.
The Details tab
The Details tab contains mostly financial information, such as annual revenue
and its stock symbol if the company is publicly traded. It’s the kind of stuff
you’ll get if you receive data from Dun and Bradstreet or other similar services
or list providers. This provides useful demographic information about the
account, assuming someone in your organization does the research to fill in
the information and keeps it current. The Details tab is shown in Figure 13-2.
Figure 13-1:
The General
tab is where
you begin
entering
information
about the
account.
151
Chapter 13: Working with Accounts and Contacts

The Territory field on the Details tab is one of the most important. Many
companies, particularly national or international ones, divide their business
into territories usually based on geography. Salespeople, or teams of sales-
people, are assigned to each territory and their revenue is tracked.
Territories should be set up in the Settings module (see Chapter 6 for more
information). Then you can manually select a territory for an account by
clicking the magnifying glass to the right of the Territory field and selecting
the appropriate territory.
You can also customize the system so that each new account is automatically
assigned to a territory or so that accounts are reassigned automatically when
it’s time to reorganize your territories. This may require the services of an
experienced dealer or developer though.
The Administration tab
The Administration tab, shown in Figure 13-3, is a catchall for accounting and
marketing and service information. The Owner field is the only required field
and is filled in automatically with the name of the user creating the record.
So, by default, the record owner is the person who enters the information. If
that’s not the way it works in your organization, you can reassign the record
to another user by clicking the magnifying glass to the right of the Owner
field and selecting the proper user.

Part III: Managing Sales 

The Originating Lead field automatically keeps track of the source of this
account record if it came from a converted lead record. Your marketing
department will definitely want this field filled in accurately so that they 
can understand which marketing efforts are generating revenue.
The Originating Lead field is  a system-generated field, so you can’t enter any-
thing into it. To be filled in, the account must be generated from a lead when
it is qualified.
It’s a great advantage for salespeople to know at least a little bit about their
clients’ billing and credit situation. The fields in the Billing section are prime
candidates for integration with whatever accounting system is being used at
your company. This integration will probably require some custom work and
is usually the domain of the business partner who sold you the software.
The fields in the Contact Methods and Marketing Information sections regu-
late how you market to and correspond with this account. Keeping track of
this is increasingly important as more and more laws go into effect regulating
how we market to prospects and clients.
Figure 13-3:
You can add
all sorts of
information
here.
153
Chapter 13: Working with Accounts and Contacts

Even if you aren’t using the Service module, the Service Preferences section
contains basic service-related information that will help you tailor manual or
automatic responses to service requests. For example, this is a simple place
to keep track of the equipment your customer has and who your preferred
technician is whenever service is needed.
The Notes tab
The Notes tab starts out as a blank slate: a large area where you can begin
typing. You should use the Notes section to record general information about
the account. After you finish typing your notes, just navigate to another sec-
tion. This is one of the few areas in CRM where you do not have to tell the
system to save your work. It does so automatically. In fact, CRM also records
who created the note and timestamps the note. Figure 13-4 shows a Notes
Tab after a few notes have been entered.
Everything you write in the Notes section is public information — and CRM
does not have a spell checker or grammar checker. Pay attention to your
writing style, and don’t enter anything that you wouldn’t want a client or a
judge to see.
Setting up subaccounts
An account record may be the parent of other account records, and those
other account records are called children. A child record is also referred to as
a subaccount. Typically, you use the subaccount system to subordinate one
record to another. An example is when you’re dealing with a company that
Figure 13-4:
The Notes
tab of the
Account
window

Notes
already
entered.
154
Part III: Managing Sales 

has multiple locations. The headquarters would be the parent account, and
each regional location would be a subaccount. By relating the accounts this
way, you can use the reporting system to consolidate, subtotal, or total rev-
enue for all the related accounts.
The General tab (refer to Figure 13-1), which is the default window when you
are creating a new account record, contains the field that relates one account
to another. This field is labeled Parent Account and has a list containing all
account records in the system. There is no limit to the number of levels of
parenting. In other words, every parent account can have multiple children,
grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, and so on.
As you create this structure, the best approach is to map out the relationships
between the accounts and begin at the top. First enter the parent account and
then enter the children. As you enter each child account, click the magnifying
glass next to the Parent Account field and select one parent to connect each
“generation.”
Finding and Viewing Account
Information
No matter what your role is, as a user of CRM you’ll find yourself looking 
up accounts, contacts, leads, and opportunities on a regular basis. You can
locate records in Microsoft CRM in two basic ways: the Find function and 
the Advanced Find function.
Find
You can access the Find function from any of the main windows. Using Find 
is the simplest and fastest way to locate a record. Figure 13-5 shows a typical
list view.
At the top of the window is a field labeled Look For. The Find button, which
actually sets this function in motion, is to the right of the field. You can locate
an account in several ways:
 Enter the first few letters of the account name in the Look For field and
click the Find button. All the accounts beginning with those letters
appear in the list. Click the account in the list to go to that account
record.
The Find function is not case sensitive, so you needn’t worry about
uppercase and lowercase.
155
Chapter 13: Working with Accounts and Contacts

 Enter part of the account name preceded or followed by an asterisk (*).
If you want to locate all the companies that have LLC in their name, you
could enter LLC in the Look For field. This locates all the accounts that
start with LLC. If you think LLC may occur in the middle or at the end of
the name, however, you can generalize your search by using *LLC*.
 Click a letter of the alphabet at the bottom of the grid and scroll through
the listing of all companies that begin with that letter. This approach 
is useful if you have a small database, but if you have hundreds of
accounts that span multiple pages, one of the other techniques is easier.
Advanced Find
The Find function enables you to locate an account record quickly if you
know the name of the account and that’s the only criterion by which you’re
searching. Advanced Find, however, provides a more powerful search capa-
bility, enabling you to locate specific records (and activities) based on multi-
ple fields. When you use Advanced Find, you can specify one or more search
conditions. For example, you can find items by account name, city, and the
name of the salesperson responsible for the account. You may want to find all
the A-level accounts in your city and send them an invitation to a seminar.
Figure 13-5:

function

156
Part III: Managing Sales 

Your search can contain Boolean operators, such as AND or OR. While using
Advanced Find, you can also enter an asterisk when performing a search (for
example, when you are searching for an account, a user, or a contact).
The values you enter are not case sensitive. For example, if you are entering a
state code, Microsoft CRM will find the same records whether you enter CT
or ct.
Boolean logic dictates that conditions within parentheses are evaluated
before conditions separated by ANDs. ANDs are evaluated before ORs. The
Advanced Find function does not have parentheses and evaluates expres-
sions in the order in which they appear in your search.
To do a search with Advanced Find, follow these steps:
1. On the main toolbar, click the Advanced Find button.
The window shown in Figure 13-6 appears.
2. In the Look For drop-down list, select the appropriate choice.
In this example, the Look For list allows you to specify which record
type Advanced Find will focus on. After you select the record type (in
this example, Accounts), all related fields are available to you. You now
proceed to the selection of specific fields, conditions and values.
3. In the first row, select a field (in this example, City) from the drop-
down list by clicking the down arrow to the right of the field name.
Based on the field you choose, the system selects your available choices
for conditions. You can see all the possible conditions by clicking the
down arrow to the right of the Condition field.
4. Choose a condition.
The most commonly used conditions are Equal, Does Not Equal,
Contains, Begins With, Contains Data, and Does Not Contain Data. Click
the condition you want from the drop-down list. In the example, we
chose Equals.
5. Enter a value in the Value field.
Microsoft CRM allows you to have multiple values in this field. If you
separate individual values with a semicolon (;), the system treats that
semicolon as if it were an OR condition. We chose Avon.
6. Continue to the next row to add additional search criteria.
If you run out of rows, click the Select button to begin another row of 
criteria.
7. Click the Save as button if you’d like to name your query and retain it
for future use.
157
Chapter 13: Working with Accounts and Contacts

Assigning and Sharing Accounts
The toolbar in every account window enables you to assign or to share your
accounts. You can also delete or deactivate an account.
Deleting accounts is usually a bad idea because any records attached to an
account, such as contacts or opportunities, also go away. After you delete an
account, you can never retrieve the information, and you can’t undo the action.
Deletion is forever. However, if you had previously set up a subaccount, that
subaccount remains.
Deactivating an account turns it off, rendering it inactive. An inactive account
can’t be edited or have other types of records associated with it. It disappears
from your usual lookups and is visible only if you specifically search for inac-
tive accounts. The advantage of deactivating over deleting is that you can
restore a deactivated account to active status should that become necessary.
Assigning accounts to users
If you go on an extended vacation, you may want to assign an account to
another user. Or perhaps the territories your company covers are being
realigned, and many accounts need to be tended to by other managers. If 
Figure 13-6:
A sample
search is
already
entered.
158
Part III: Managing Sales 

you assign one of your accounts to another user, that new person becomes
the account owner, and you are removed from that position.
To assign one or more accounts, follow these steps:
1. In the upper part of the navigation pane, select Accounts.
The Accounts window appears.
2. Choose the accounts you want to reassign by clicking (highlighting)
each account listing.
You can select multiple accounts by using the Shift key or the Ctrl key.
The Shift key selects all the accounts from the first one you selected to
the one you are currently positioned on. Hold down the Ctrl key and
click to select noncontiguous accounts.
3. Click the Assign icon.
The Assign Accounts window appears.
4. Click the radio button next to Assign to another user.
5. Click the magnifying glass at the end of the User field.
A window opens for choosing the new user.
6. Select the new user and click OK.
The system returns to the Accounts window. You will no longer be able
to see the reassigned account in the list unless you change the View to
Active Accounts.
Sharing accounts
Sharing is a little different from assigning. Sharing one of your accounts 
doesn’t remove you from ownership; it merely adds additional users to 
the team servicing that account.
To share one or more accounts, follow these steps:
1. Go to the Account List View and select all the Accounts you want to
share.
You can select multiple Accounts at one time by using the Shift key or
the Ctrl key. The Shift key will select all the Accounts from the first one
you selected to the one you are currently positioned on. The Ctrl key
allows you to randomly select individual Accounts.
2. In the window’s toolbar, select More Actions and then select Sharing.
The Who Would You Like to Share the Selected Account With window
appears.
159
Chapter 13: Working with Accounts and Contacts

3. Choose the users or the team from the Who Would You Like to Share
This Account With dialog box.
After you select the users or teams, the system returns you to a List
View with check boxes for the security privileges assigned to each user
or team. By default, none of these privileges are assigned.
4. Select the security privileges you want to give to each of the users
with whom you are sharing by checking all the appropriate boxes.
5. To save these sharing specifications, click OK.
Adding and Editing Contacts
You can add a contact record that stands alone, or you can add one that is
associated with an account record. Adding or editing contact records is
almost identical to the process you follow for account records.
Contacts have a list view just as accounts do. This view can be accessed from
the Sales, Marketing, or Service area. The Contact database is the same for all
three areas of CRM, so all your users access the same contact records.
Individual contacts can be added or edited manually in the same way that
account records are handled. Contact records have a Parent Account field
just as account records do. If you do business only with individuals, you may
never need the Parent Account field. You should use it, however, if you need
to associate a person with a company. Note that you can associate many dif-
ferent people with the same company (account record).
In addition to the manual entry of contact records, Microsoft CRM also 
comes with an automated wizard-based system for importing contact
records. Although the wizard was designed with Outlook files in mind, the
import facility can handle other types of data, such as text (.TXT) files.
Some of the more standard file types, such as .XLS, .MDF, and .DBF, don’t
work with the Import Wizard. And, although you can do at least a limited
import of contact records, you’re going to have trouble if you want to bring in
associated activities for your contacts. If you need to perform a significant
amount of importing, investigate the third-party import products discussed
in Chapter 28 or check the Microsoft CRM Data Migration Framework.

Managing Your Calendar
In This Chapter
 Displaying your calendar
 Checking out your activities
 Making an appointment
 Scheduling others
 Assigning activities
 Completing activities
M
icrosoft CRM comes with a basic activity management system that
enables you to schedule or log activities associated with the various
records in the database, such as opportunities, leads, contacts, accounts, or
cases.
Your calendar is a subset of your activities and displays only appointments.
Your activities show a wider assortment of things that take up your time,
such as phone calls and miscellaneous tasks such as meeting with your boss
or coordinating the company golf outing. In addition, only the appointments
on your calendar are coordinated with Outlook. Phone calls and tasks never
show up in the main area of Outlook.
Aside from the obvious practice of entering all your activities in the system
to ensure that they are properly documented and that you don’t forget to do
them, workflow rules can also have an important role with activities in your
business processes. Workflow rules can look for overdue activities and alert
you to them. They can look for activities that should be scheduled (such as
following up on a quote that was sent out a week ago or an annual mainte-
nance contract that is coming due next month) and send a series of alerts to
the right team members. This is a powerful use of scheduling, but it works
well only if everyone on the team is consistently logging his or her activities.
(We discuss workflow in detail in Chapter 8.)

The ingredients essential to activity management include viewing existing
activities, entering new activities, delegating activities, the inevitable
rescheduling of activities, and completing activities. In the next few pages,
you’ll find out how to manage your activities and, to the extent possible, the
activities of others as well.
No Outlook Here
Microsoft designed its CRM product assuming that most users would also be
using Outlook. In this chapter, we discuss how to use Microsoft CRM’s activ-
ity management system assuming that you’re not using Outlook. This is a big
assumption, but it helps simplify the discussion of calendar usage.
If you’re not going to use Outlook, you’ll want to look at the Service Scheduling
calendar as a way to keep you and your team members on the same page. You
won’t be getting any alarms about appointments or due dates. (Maybe you
view this as a good thing!)
Chapter 3 covers using Outlook with Microsoft CRM. If you’re an Outlook
user, consider reviewing Chapter 3 next. Doing so will fill in the holes created
in this chapter.
If you’re coming to Microsoft CRM with experience using another CRM
system, you may wonder where some of the more advanced teamwork 
functionality is hiding. So, before you start looking around, here are some 
of the program’s shortcomings:
 To look at everyone else’s activities, you have to go to the Service
Scheduling area. Using Outlook provides some assistance here, though,
in that it allows for shared calendars.
 You can schedule other users to do something, but no convenient, 
automatic way exists to notify them that you did the scheduling. And
because you can’t see their calendar easily, you may end up scheduling
them into a conflict. Outlook’s Meeting Request is the answer to this sit-
uation. (And Outlook Meeting Requests can be linked to CRM, so this 
is a viable workaround.)
 You can’t set an alarm on any kind of activity to alert you to an upcom-
ing event. Therefore, Microsoft also doesn’t have a snooze button.
 The system doesn’t automatically roll over activities from one day to 
the next if you don’t complete something when you’re supposed to.
Activities do remain on your calendar as past-due activities and will
show up on your activity list as long as you fail to complete them.
Some of these oversights are resolved if you’re using the remote, Outlook-like
version of the system. More on that in Chapter 3.
162
Part III: Managing Sales 

Having now finished our complaints, we must say, in all fairness, that
Microsoft CRM enables you to schedule and track all the important activities
associated with customers. If you use this feature consistently, you’ll always
be organized. You’ll never forget to do the important things. You’ll make more
money, live long, and prosper. But we do still need to easily see and share our
staff’s calendars.
Viewing Your Calendar
To display your calendar, click the Workplace button at the bottom of the
navigation pane. Then, at the top of the pane, click Calendar, which appears
under My Work. (If nothing appears under My Work, click the plus sign next
to it to display the list.) The Calendar window appears on the right, as shown
in Figure 14-1.
The calendar displays the weekly view of appointments and service activi-
ties. Note that service activities are activities associated with the Service
module that have not only a user but also company resources. The informa-
tion is available also in the Service Scheduling window, which allows users to
see other user’s calendars and activities.
The area on the far right of the screen contains a calendar you can use to
change the date or date range of the calendar display. You also can select
from three display modes, month, week, and day.
Figure 14-1:

163
Chapter 14: Managing Your Calendar

The calendar is just a subset of your activities (only appointments and service-
related activities) with a more graphical view of them.
Viewing Your Activities
If you really want to know what’s on your agenda, the Activities window is the
place to go. To get there, select Activities under My Work at the top of the
navigation pane. Figure 14-2 shows a typical Activities window. This is proba-
bly where your day should begin and where you should spend much of your
professional life.
Figure 14-2 shows the Activities window for appointments, but remember you
can manage eight types of activities in Microsoft CRM:
 Tasks
 Fax
 Phone call
 E-mail
 Letter
Figure 14-2:

164
Part III: Managing Sales 

 Appointment
 Service activity
 Campaign response
Clicking the column title re-sorts your activities by that column, from ascend-
ing to descending order. Activities are sorted within each day’s display. If you
want to adjust the width of a column, drag the border between the column
titles. You can change the columns displayed by saving your own Advanced
Find searches, or your system administrator or implementation partner can
create customized views.
At the top of the window, the Look For field allows you to locate scheduled
activities based on the subject. Although you can use the alphabetical listing
bar at the bottom of the window to locate Subjects beginning with a particu-
lar letter, the Look For field is more flexible. For example, you can enter con-
secutive characters, such as flor, to find activity subjects starting with, say,
Florida. You can also use the wildcard character * to match any sequence of
characters.
If you are trying to find all your activities, enter * in the Look For field and
then click the Find button. This will display both open and closed activities.
You might think by just choosing My Activities in the View drop-down list, all
your activities would be displayed. But you’d be missing the closed activities
with that method of searching.
You can use the View menu (in the upper-right corner of the Activities
window) to select from one of several views. Your selection of a view works
with your Find Activity selection. These views are
 All Activities: This comprehensive list displays open and completed
activities no matter whose they are.
 Closed Activities: These are all the completed activities the system con-
tains — yours and everyone else’s.
 My Activities: These are the activities on your schedule. This is proba-
bly the most important view and the one we use most often.
 My Closed Activities: These are all your completed activities that the
system contains.
 Open Activities: These are all open activities, whether they belong to
someone else or to you. Unfortunately, the default view does not show
to whom they belong.
 Scheduled Activities: These are all your scheduled appointments.
Of course, there are no activities to view if you don’t enter some in the first
place. Creating these activities in CRM is the subject of the next section.
165
Chapter 14: Managing Your Calendar

Creating an Appointment for Yourself
You can create an appointment for yourself directly from the Workplace,
which Microsoft online help suggests. This method is quick, but you can
easily cause yourself problems by flippantly agreeing to some appointment
without first checking your calendar — or better yet, your activity list.
The calendar shows only appointments, not tasks or phone calls. If you want
to avoid scheduling two conference calls at the same time, for example, use
the Activities window instead of the calendar.
You are always better off checking before you schedule appointments. For
that reason, we recommend another approach to scheduling your appoint-
ments when working online in Microsoft CRM:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Workplace button. At
the top of the pane, select Activities (under My Work).
Review your schedule here before committing to another appointment
or activity.
2. In the Activities window’s toolbar, click the New button.
3. Select an activity (such as Appointment) and then click OK.
Figure 14-3 shows a typical window for entering appointment details. We
describe this screen in detail in a moment.
Figure 14-3:
Planning to
meet with
your agent.
166
Part III: Managing Sales 

4. Fill in the details.
5. When you’re finished, click the Save and Close button.
You return to the Activities window.
The Appointment window is divided into three tabs: Appointment, Notes, and
Details. Several fields deserve clarification or further elaboration:
 Organizer: This field is on the Details tab. The Organizer is the person
coordinating the activity and is not necessarily one of the attendees.
This is the person you blame when the meeting is messed up.
 Required and Optional: These are two fields on the Appointment tab.
When you click the magnifying glass to the right of each of these fields,
CRM presents a window allowing you to specify one or more people
involved in the meeting. The first field, Required, is for those people for
whom attendance is mandatory. The Optional field is for people not
quite so important.
 Subject: The text you enter in the Subject field appears in the Activities
window and the Calendar window. In the weekly view of the calendar,
the text wraps so you can see it all. In the daily view, if the text is too
long, it is cut off.
 Start Time and End Time: If you don’t enter a start and end time, 
particularly for appointments, the times will not be displayed on 
your calendar.
 Event: By default, an event is a day-long activity. When you select an All
Day Event, you no longer have the option of selecting specific times.
However, you can specify the dates; if the end date is different from the
beginning date, you’ve created an activity that spans multiple days.
Vacations are a good example of an appropriate use of events.
 Notes: The Notes section is an unlabeled free-form text area that appears
on the lines just below the time span and subject on the calendar.
 Regarding: This field enables you to attach an activity to one or more
records, such as contacts, accounts, or leads. By associating the activity
with more than one record, you can then see the activity from any of
those records.
That’s what it takes to schedule something for yourself. One of the more pow-
erful features of CRM systems is the ability to schedule activities for other
people — that is, to delegate. That’s what we discuss next.
Scheduling for Other People
How you use Outlook determines how you can best schedule activities for
others on your team. Specifically, if calendar sharing is enabled in Outlook,
167
Chapter 14: Managing Your Calendar

scheduling is easy. Even if sharing is not enabled, you can use Outlook’s
meeting request functionality to assist in setting up activities for other
people. Outlook is discussed in detail in Chapter 3. Assuming you’re not
using Outlook, you still have a few options.
Because you can’t actually see anyone else’s complete schedule using
Microsoft CRM, it would be improper to even try to put anything directly on
someone else’s calendar. You are left with two options when attempting to
schedule the activities of others: e-mail requests and instant messaging.
You can use Microsoft CRM’s e-mail system to send an activity “suggestion”
to one or more users on your team. You can attach the e-mail to the appropri-
ate record and request that the other users schedule that phone call or
appointment.
The second method for coordinating your activities with other members of
your team is to use one of the instant messaging systems. They’re free, which
makes them even more appealing. The most common ones are Microsoft’s
Instant Messenger, Yahoo!, AOL, and ICQ.
Everyone in your user group must use the same instant messaging system.
Several compelling reasons exist for implementing such a system. You can
see who is online and available at any given moment. You can coordinate
with users who are widely separated geographically. We like the instant part
of the equation also. In addition, some instant messaging systems keep a his-
tory of your messages. You could, when the conversation is over, cut and
paste the message history into the Notes section of the appropriate record.
In a flash, you can ask another user to call a client and get a confirmation that
that task is going to happen. This is an ideal way to respond to a client call
requesting service or support.
Assigning an Activity to Someone
When you create an activity, you can assign it directly to yourself (by default)
or to another user or a queue. Similarly, you can reassign an activity to
another user or a queue. When you do reassign an activity, the ownership of
that activity doesn’t change until the intended user or queue accepts the
assignment. Activities may be assigned from anywhere but can be accepted
only from the Queues area of the Workplace.
Assigning an activity is our favorite. We love to delegate. To do so, follow
these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Workplace button. At
the top of the pane, under My Work, click Activities.
168
Part III: Managing Sales 

The Activities window appears on the right. Based on your selection in
the View field, you see some or all of your scheduled activities.
2. Select one or more activities that you want to assign to someone else.
In Figure 14-4, we’ve selected two activities.
You can select one or more activities by highlighting those activities and
using either the Shift key (for contiguous activities) or the Ctrl key (for
noncontiguous activities).
3. Click the Assign icon in the Activities toolbar.
The Assign to Queue or User dialog box appears to lead you through the
sequence of actions to delegate all the activities you highlighted in Step 2.
4. Click the magnifying glass at the end of the field to see the entire list
of users to whom you might assign these activities.
5. Select one or more users from the list.
6. Click OK.
CRM returns to the Activities window.
You can also choose to delete activities, but this is generally a poor choice
because you can’t undo a deletion. If an activity is being cancelled, you
should complete it (see the next section) and include a note that the activity
was canceled by the client or by a user.
Figure 14-4:
Delegating
everything

want to do.
169
Chapter 14: Managing Your Calendar

Completing an Activity
Nothing is as satisfying as getting things off your activity list. To complete, or
close, an activity, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Workplace button. At
the top of the pane, under My Work, click Activities.
The Activities window appears on the right.
2. To follow along with the example, select an appointment that you
want to mark as completed.
The Appointment window appears, with three tabs: Appointment, Notes,
and Details.
3. Click the Notes tab and create a note that will be attached to the
record.
A typical Notes screen is shown in Figure 14-5. Documenting what you
do is important so the historical trail for this record is complete.
4. Click the Save and Close button.
We have a saying in our office: “If it’s not in CRM, you didn’t do it.” A rough
translation is that unless you enter your activities and close them when
you’ve completed them, there’s no evidence that you did anything. Later,
you’ll be explaining to a skeptical boss that you really did make those follow-
up calls but just didn’t bother completing them in CRM. Complete every
activity immediately afterwards. Then there’s no doubt.

Setting Sales Quotas and
Generating Forecasts
In This Chapter
 Setting up quotas
 Forecasting sales
 Updating a forecast
 Examining forecast data
T
oward the end of every year, our sales team sits down and develops a
plan for the coming year. That plan includes the products we will sell,
who will sell those products, and a guideline for how much of each product
our account managers will sell (we hope). That guideline translates into a
quota in Microsoft CRM.
The quota not only helps us budget for the coming year but also gives us a
series of monthly or quarterly milestones. Failure to meet quotas or mile-
stones causes midterm reevaluations or sometimes something worse. Meeting
or exceeding our goals is what keeps our company healthy and happy.
In this chapter, you find out how to set quotas for salespeople, how to log
forecasted sales against those quotas, and how to adjust these forecasts and
quotas as you go along.
How a Manager Sets Up Quotas
Quotas relate to your company’s quarterly fiscal periods. Before you can set
up a quota for anyone, Microsoft CRM needs to know your company’s fiscal
periods. Fiscal periods may be set only once, and the task should probably
be performed by someone with a title like CFO.

Fiscal year settings
Quotas are usually related to the time period in which accountants measure
profits and losses, that is, the fiscal period. Accountants have devised a vari-
ety of fiscal years. They can be based on calendar years or can end on other
seemingly random dates. A fiscal year can be semiannual or divided into
quarters.
You can set the fiscal year options only once. You cannot change these set-
tings after you have set them.
To set a fiscal year, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Settings button.
Eleven customization topics appear on the right.
2. In the Settings window, select Organization Settings.
The Organization Settings window appears.
3. Select Fiscal Year Settings from the list.
The Fiscal Year Settings window appears, as shown in Figure 15-1.
4. Enter the starting date for your fiscal year as well as the periods you
use for measuring revenue.
The required Template field allows you to specify your fiscal periods.
The rest of the fields in this window allow you to specify the naming
conventions your company uses and the formatting of the periods.
Figure 15-1:
Creating
your fiscal
year
information.
172
Part III: Managing Sales 

You need to enter the fiscal year information carefully and correctly
because you get only one shot at it. The system displays a warning mes-
sage to this effect. You also can’t enter sales quotas until you’ve entered
the fiscal year settings.
5. Click OK to save your entries.
Setting up a salesperson’s quota
After the fiscal year information is set, you need to establish quotas. Of
course, before quotas can be entered into the system, your management
team must develop a business plan and sales plan and coordinate the quotas
with that plan.
To set up the quota for a user (salesperson), follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Settings button.
2. In the Settings window, select Business Unit Settings.
This selection brings you to a window with eight topics.
3. Select Users.
A list of all available users of the system appears.
4. Select one or more salespeople.
Although users is a more general term than salespeople, usually only
salespeople have quotas. To select more than one salesperson, hold
down the Ctrl key while clicking with the mouse. If a group of salespeo-
ple have the same quota, you can set quotas for the group all at once.
5. From the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Actions➪Manage
Quotas.
The Manage Quotas dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 15-2.
If you have selected more than one user, you may get a warning mes-
sage. If this is the case, the new quota you are about to enter will over-
ride any existing quota. If that was not your intention, you can cancel
the operation; you return to the list of users (Step 3), where you can
make another selection.
6. On the right side of the window, fill in each period’s quota.
These quotas will apply to every salesperson you selected in Step 4.
However, nothing happens until you click the Apply button.
7. Click the Apply button at the bottom of the dialog box.
Your quotas are saved. This is an important step. If you click OK without
applying your changes, nothing is saved.
173
Chapter 15: Setting Sales Quotas and Generating Forecasts

8. Click the OK button at the bottom of the dialog box.
You return to the Quota window.
9. If you want to enter a quota for another salesperson, repeat Steps 4
through 8.
Entering Sales Forecasts
Anyone who’s been in sales for more than a day has wrestled with sales fore-
casting in some fashion. This wrestling match may have been with some
formal system or may have been a manager demanding to know when that
big deal is going to finally go down. Without reasonably accurate sales fore-
casts, it is difficult for management to steer the boat.
Forecasts in Microsoft CRM are part of the Opportunities section of the pro-
gram (in the Sales module). The words forecast and opportunity are nearly
synonymous in this system.
To enter a new opportunity, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Sales button. At the top
of the pane, select Opportunities.
The Opportunities window appears on the right, as shown in Figure 15-3.
2. In the Opportunities window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Opportunity: New window appears, as shown in Figure 15-4. On the
General tab, the Topic and Potential Customer fields are both required
fields.

4. Fill in the Potential Customer field as follows:
a. Click the magnifying glass to the right of the Potential Customer
field so you can link the opportunity.
Every opportunity should be linked to an account or a contact.
b. In the Look For field, select Account or Contact.
To follow along with the example, select Account.
A customer can be either an account (a business) or a contact (a
person).
c. Enter a portion of the potential customer’s name and then click
Find to locate the specific account or customer to which you are
linking this opportunity.
(We discuss the Find function in detail in Chapter 2.) The Look Up
Records dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 15-5.
d. In the Account Name field, select an account.
The General tab of the Opportunity: New window reappears.
5. For the Revenue option, select User Provided.
If price lists have been set up, you may be able to have the system calcu-
late the price of your list of products and services. In this example, we
are assuming you don’t have price lists that apply, so a manual entry of
the price is needed.

6. In the Est. Revenue field, enter the estimated revenue from this 
opportunity.
7. Fill in the Est. Close date field using the calendar at the end of the
field.
8. In the Probability field, enter the probability of closing the deal.
If your company uses a sales process automated by workflow rules, this
field may be autopopulated.
9. If you want, make a selection in the Rating drop-down list.
You can rate the deal Hot, Warm, or Cold, but the Probability field
covers this.
10. In the Description field, add any comments.
You might notice that a Notes tab is associated with this new opportu-
nity. There is no rule for using the Description field versus the Notes tab.
However, for complex sales that take a long time to close or involve a
team of people, we use the Notes tab so that each note can be time
stamped and date stamped. For simpler and shorter deals, we use the
Description field.
11. Click the Save and Close button.
You return to the Opportunities window.
Updating Your Forecasts
Forecasts have a tendency to get stale quickly. We recommend that you
review and revise your forecasts at least once a week. These revisions need
to focus not only on the estimated close date but also on every field that 
may have changed.
To update a forecast, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Sales button. Then at
the top of the pane, select Opportunities.
The Opportunities window appears on the right. If the opportunity you
need to check doesn’t appear, check the View menu in the upper-right
corner to make sure you’re looking at My Open Opportunities or Open
Opportunities.
2. Select the opportunity in question.
The detailed information for the opportunity appears, as shown in
Figure 15-6.
177
Chapter 15: Setting Sales Quotas and Generating Forecasts

3. Make your modifications.
Although much of the forecast is for your own benefit and is meant to
keep you on track, the forecast is also probably being reviewed by the
sales management team. Reasonable and realistic estimates are always
better than pie-in-the-sky guesses.
4. Click the Save and Close button.
The Opportunities window reappears. From here, you can review or edit
another opportunity that needs attention.
Examining Your Forecast Data
Microsoft CRM has built-in reports that focus on opportunity management:
opportunity reports and pipeline reports. These can be customized by your
dealer or by a knowledgeable systems administrator. Additional custom
reports can also be added. However, that customization is outside the scope
of this book.
Opportunity reports are typically simple line reports with subtotals or totals.
They can be filtered and sorted by territory, potential revenue, closing proba-
bility, salesperson, and many other fields.
Figure 15-6:
It’s all in the
details.
178
Part III: Managing Sales 

Pipeline reports and charts generally involve a little math. If you are a sales
manager, you may want to see how much each salesperson is likely to close
this quarter. A pipeline report can show this to you, either in tabular or
graphic form, by multiplying the potential revenue by the probability.
Printing a report
To select a report for printing or saving, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Sales button. Then, at
the top of the pane, select Opportunities.
The Opportunities window appears.
2. In the View drop-down list, select the opportunities you want to
report on.
For example, choose My Open Opportunities if you want to see only
your own deals, or choose Open Opportunities if you want a more 
company-wide report (assuming you have the rights to see these).
3. In the window’s toolbar, click the Reports button.
The system displays a list of all available reports. Our copy of the soft-
ware lists just two reports: Competitor Win Loss and Lead Source
Effectiveness.
4. Select a report from the list.
After the system processes all the data, the reports appears on your
screen.
5. Print or save the report.
Using Excel
You can export your forecast data directly to a local copy of Excel on your
own computer. Then, if you have even a little facility with Excel you can
manipulate the data and look at it in a tabular or in a graphical presentation.
(If you need help with Excel, get a copy of Excel 2003 For Dummies.)
To export your forecast data to Excel, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Sales button. At the top
of the pane, select Opportunities.
The Opportunities window appears.
179
Chapter 15: Setting Sales Quotas and Generating Forecasts

2. In the View drop-down list, select the types of opportunities you want
in your Excel export.
3. In the window’s toolbar, click the Excel icon.
A screen appears with several worksheet choices.
4. For the simplest kind of export, select the first option, and then click
Export.
CRM loads your data into a local copy of Excel. You can then calculate
totals, add columns with calculated values, or even create graphs.
5. For more sophisticated dynamic Excel tables, select the second or
third choice.
Dynamic worksheets automatically update their data as you change the
data in another application.
Sales forecasting is one of the most critical aspects of the sales process at
our company. It allows each salesperson to track his or her progress, and the
information in the combined sales forecasts gives management a view of
coming attractions. Most importantly, this same information allows workflow
rules to ensure that no sale falls through the cracks.

F
ifteen years ago, believe it or not, the world operated without e-mail 
(no, it wasn’t the Bronze Age). Our office manager twitches when she
remembers the good ol’ days (but it could be the caffeine). Try and run 
your business without e-mail today and you probably wouldn’t get very 
far. E-mail is now an essential part of your relations with your customers 
or, rather, your CRM.
With e-mail becoming such a large part of your contact with customers, the
concern arises about documentation. With no paper trail, you have no lever-
age when and if you need it. On the not-so-dramatic side, it’s just good busi-
ness practice to keep track of everything between you and your customers.
In Microsoft CRM, you can do this by linking, or associating, e-mails with your
clients, so that Mrs. Reynolds’s e-mail thanking the Toaster Man for all his
wonderful help gets put in her record and not on the record of, say, Acme
Credit Collections. No one would be able to find it! Any good CRM applica-
tion, Microsoft CRM included, allows you and your staff to link e-mails to
accounts and activities.
You send two basic types of e-mail messages: one to individuals (such as the
Toaster Guy thanking Mrs. Reynolds for those brownies) and one to groups 
of people. Some call the latter an e-mail blast, others call it a marketing cam-
paign or mass mailing, and yet others call it spam. The legality issues of
lunchmeat aside, Microsoft CRM calls it direct e-mail. With direct e-mail, you
can send an e-mail to a group of contacts. And although these mailings can go
to hundreds of people, each recipient receives an individualized e-mail mes-
sage with no hint that he or she was included in a larger group. We’ll cover
direct e-mail later in this chapter.

For right now, we’ll stick with plain ol’ e-mail and show you how to send and
receive e-mails and link them to contacts and activities using the Microsoft
CRM interface. (For information on working with e-mail offline using Outlook,
see Chapter 3.)
Microsoft CRM also lets you do the following:
 Create and preview e-mail messages from within other activities, such as
an account or a case.
 Link e-mail messages to activities, contacts, or accounts.
 Receive and reply to e-mail messages.
 Create and use personal and public e-mail templates.
 Receive your e-mail in the Microsoft Office Outlook mailbox or in
Microsoft CRM as an e-mail activity. Note that if you receive all your
e-mail as a Microsoft CRM e-mail activity, the e-mail can be accessed by
anyone who can open your activities.
Setting Up Your E-Mail Options
The first thing you’ll need to do to get your e-mail working is to set up your
e-mail options. Microsoft CRM logs incoming and outgoing e-mail messages
as records. Each e-mail record contains the content of the message as well as
associations with other records in CRM, such as accounts, contacts, cases,
and opportunities.
Converting an e-mail message to a record can occur only if one of two condi-
tions exists:
 The Microsoft CRM Exchange Connector recognizes the e-mail as a reply
to an e-mail that was originally sent from Microsoft CRM.
 You define a personal option to convert all incoming e-mail messages to
CRM records.
Here’s how you set those personal options:
1. On the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Tools➪Options.
The Set Personal Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-1.
(You can set all your personal options in this dialog box. For more on
these other options, see Chapter 4.)
182
Part III: Managing Sales 

2. Click the Activities tab.
On this tab, you have three areas, but we are concerned only with the
last area.
3. Make a selection in the Select the e-mail messages to track in
Microsoft CRM area.
If you select All e-mail messages, all e-mail messages are linked to Micro-
soft CRM records. If you select E-mail messages that contain a Microsoft
CRM tracking token, only those messages that are replies to messages
that you have sent (sometimes called a thread) are linked to Microsoft
CRM records. Regardless of which option you select, the linked records
become activity records that are seen as history in Microsoft CRM.
4. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Your changes are saved automatically.
Out of the box, Microsoft CRM e-mail supports only Microsoft Exchange
Server e-mail. Your administrator or implementation partner must link
Microsoft CRM and Microsoft Exchange Server using the Microsoft CRM-
Exchange Server Connector. If you do not have that installed, no e-mail is
linked to CRM. So if you want e-mail in Microsoft CRM, make sure that this
piece gets installed on your system.

Chapter 16: Using E-Mail

Viewing E-Mail
Now that you’ve set up your e-mail preference, go get your coffee because it’s
time to get to work. There are two basic types of e-mail that you’ll be dealing
with. Your personal e-mail (meaning mail coming directly to you) in the
Activities window and e-mails associated with queues, which can be found in
the Queues window.
Viewing your personal e-mail
First, we’ll look at your personal e-mail. Follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Workplace button. At
the top of the pane, select Activities.
This view shows all your activities, including e-mails, as shown in 
Figure 16-2.
Figure 16-2:
Activity
central —
where you
can manage
your
activities.
184
Part III: Managing Sales 

2. In the Type field, click the arrow to open the drop-down list, and
select E-mail.
Now you’ve weeded out all activities except your e-mail.
3. In the View field, click the arrow to open the drop-down list and make
your selection.
You have yet more options here: All E-mails; My Draft E-mails (draft
e-mails are those that you’ve created but not yet sent); My Received
E-mails; or My Sent E-mails. You can choose any of these, depending on
what you want.
Use the Look For and Date fields to further narrow the list of displayed 
activities.
Viewing queue e-mail
As we mentioned, queue e-mail is the other type of e-mail you can view. An
example of queue e-mail is e-mail that arrives through your Web site. You
know those forms where a visitor fills out some information, types a message,
and clicks Submit? The Web site generates an e-mail that comes straight into
the designated queue. Another example is the e-mail that goes to a generic
e-mail address, such as sales@acme.com. All e-mail to that address goes into
a queue and is assigned from that queue to the customer service staff.
To see all e-mails associated with queues, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Workplace button. At
the top of the pane, select Queues.
The Queues window appears, as shown in Figure 16-3. The window has
its own navigation pane, which contains two main folders to hold your
work: My Work and Queues.
2. In the Queue workspace, double-click an e-mail to open it.
My Work (Assigned and In Progress) shows everything (e-mails included)
assigned to you and stuff that you’re working on. The Queues area displays a
folder for each queue your username is assigned to. Chapter 26 covers man-
aging and creating queues. Each folder under Queues holds e-mails (and
other activities) assigned to that.
185
Chapter 16: Using E-Mail

Creating Outgoing E-Mail
Alrighty, now that you can find and view your e-mail, it’s time to create an
e-mail, maybe thanking Mrs. Reynolds for those brownies she sent. Microsoft
CRM has creating e-mail down to a science and that’s a good thing, especially
for those who process a hundred e-mails or more a day (don’t laugh, it 
happens).
Microsoft CRM defines e-mail as an activity, just like a task, a call, or an
appointment.
Here’s how you create an e-mail message:
1. From the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose New➪New
Activity➪E-mail. Or click the Create New E-mail icon below the 
menu bar.
The E-mail: New window appears, as shown in Figure 16-4. You can start
a new e-mail from anywhere inside the program. Lots of fields are avail-
able, but only the Owner is required.
2. Select a recipient of your e-mail as follows:
a. Click the magnifying glass icon to the right of the To field.
The Look Up Records dialog box appears, and you can look for
accounts, contacts, leads, queues, or users. Your search results
appear to the left, under Available Records.
Figure 16-3:
Take a look
at your work
and all the
queues to
which you
are
assigned.
186
Part III: Managing Sales 

b. Highlight the record you want.
You may select multiple names or names from a combination of
lists by pressing the Ctrl key as you highlight each name.
c. Click the >> button to move the recipient(s) to the Selected
Records pane.
d. Click OK to close this window and return to your e-mail.
If you add several recipients, each one will be able to see all the names.
You can use the BCC function if you want to blind-copy recipients on this
e-mail or use Microsoft CRM’s direct e-mail feature (as described later).
You can also choose to CC someone (such as when you’re sending an
e-mail to a client and want your boss to see the e-mail too).
CC means carbon copy; all recipients see the names on the e-mail. BCC
means blind carbon copy; recipients will not see the names or addresses
on the e-mail.
3. Enter a subject.
The Subject field is free-form, so you can type anything here. Whatever
you type in the Subject field replaces the word New at the top of your
E-mail: New window. Keep in mind that sending an e-mail with no subject
is usually considered bad e-mail etiquette. It also increases the chances
that your e-mail will be considered spam and will be filtered out by the
recipient’s spam filter.
Figure 16-4:
This is
where you
address and
compose
your
messages.
187
Chapter 16: Using E-Mail

4. In the open text box below Subject, type your message.
You have typical formatting options — cut, copy, paste, alignment, spec-
ify fonts, sizes, styles, colors, indents, bullets, numbering, and the like.
You can also insert templates or knowledge base articles. (Knowledge
base articles are covered in Chapter 9. Templates are covered later in
this chapter.)
5. To associate, or link, the message to a record, do the following:
a. Click the magnifying glass icon to the right of the Regarding field.
The Look Up records dialog box appears.
b. Search for your contact, and then click to highlight it.
c. Click OK.
6. Add other options as desired.
The remaining optional fields are Duration, Priority, Due, Category, and
Sub-Category. Duration and Priority use drop-down boxes. The Due field
offers you a calendar, but you can also enter the date free-form.
Category and Sub-Category are also free-form fields.
7. To add an attachment to your e-mail:
a. First click Save (the disk icon).
b. Click the Attachments tab.
c. Follow the directions in the next section.
We cover attachments next, in “Adding attachments to e-mail 
messages.”
8. To send your message, click the Send button (next to Save and Close).
Voila, the e-mail is on its way.
To find a record of your e-mail, go to the account (or record) to which the
message was associated and select History in the navigation pane. E-mails
displayed there have a status of Sent.
Saving an e-mail message doesn’t send it. Instead, the e-mail is assigned a
Draft status. To view and edit the message, click the Draft E-Mail folder under
Activities in the Workplace tab, and then click the e-mail you want to review.
Adding attachments to e-mail messages
Just like in Microsoft Outlook, in Microsoft CRM you can attach pretty much
anything to an e-mail. Here’s how you add that attachment:
188
Part III: Managing Sales 

1. With your e-mail message appearing in the E-mail: New window, click
the Save icon (if you haven’t done so already).
2. Click the Attachments tab (see Figure 16-5).
3. In the window’s toolbar, click the New E-Mail Attachment button.
The Add Attachment dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-6.
4. Click the Browse button to search for the file you want to attach.
A standard Microsoft window appears, so you can browse to the loca-
tion of your document.
Figure 16-6:
Search for
and attach
files from
this window.
Figure 16-5:
Here’s
where you
add attach-
ments.
189
Chapter 16: Using E-Mail

5. After you’ve found your document, click OK.
You return to the Add Attachment dialog box, and the document path is
now in the field to the left of the Browse button.
6. Click the Attach button.
The text in the Add Attachment dialog box changes to the document
path in the File Name field. A Remove button appears, replacing the
Browse and Attach buttons.
7. Click Close to add the attachment to the message.
The Add Attachment dialog box closes and you’re returned to the
Attachments tab of your new e-mail. If you want to add more attach-
ments, repeat Step 3–5.
If you want to delete an attachment from the e-mail (you had too much
caffeine and got carried away with that Control-select function), just
highlight the document and click the X next to the printer icon.
8. Click Save (the disk icon).
After you click Save, the e-mail (with the attachment) is saved as a draft
in the My Draft E-Mails view in the Activities window.
9. You can either send the e-mail by clicking Send or continue working
on the message by clicking the E-mail tab.
Viewing your sent e-mail
Let’s go back to that e-mail you sent Mrs. Reynolds, thanking her for the
brownies. Maybe you attached a coupon to the e-mail, and you want to make
sure you attached the right one. Reading your sent e-mail is simple. Just
remember that sent e-mail can’t be edited, except to change the owner of the
e-mail, but it can be replied to or forwarded.
That said, here’s how you would check out a sent e-mail:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Workplace button.
Then, at the top of the pane, select Activities.
2. In the Type field, choose E-mail from the drop-down list.
This narrows the activities in your workspace to your e-mail.
3. In the View field, choose My Sent E-mails from the drop-down list.
All your e-mails are weeded out, except the sent ones. You can see
e-mails sent to clients in other ways to, but we find that this method is
the simplest.
190
Part III: Managing Sales 

You can click at the top of any column to reorganize your sent e-mail,
and you can also search by date and by the Find field.
4. After you’ve found the sent e-mail you want to view, double-click it to
open it.
The e-mail dialog box appears. In the bottom-left corner of the window,
the status is Sent. The only field that you can edit in this window is the
owner. All the other fields are either unclickable or the magnifying glass
is dimmed.
To forward a message, make sure the e-mail message appears on the screen.
Then, in the menu bar, click Forward. Note that the Forward option is avail-
able only after the e-mail window is open.
You can also go to the history of the account or contact to whom you sent
the e-mail to view it and forward it, if necessary. That account’s or contact’s
completed activities are listed, and you can search for them by using the
Filter On options or by clicking the label of a column to sort by that column.
Assigning and Accepting E-Mail
As you know by now, e-mail is one of the most popular forms of communica-
tion. In Microsoft CRM, you can assign and forward e-mails. You can also
easily accept e-mail. As mentioned earlier in the chapter, you can work on
two basic types of e-mail: your personal e-mail and e-mail in the queues. In
this section, we look at both types.
Assigning e-mail
So, let’s go to Mr. Wayne and his Cobweb Catchers business. He uses your
Heavy-Duty Super-Sucker X1138 model vacuum, and it’s making a funny noise
(kind of a WANG! thwip-boop). He’s e-mailed you because you’re his sales rep
(and therefore omnipotent).
You have no clue what’s causing that noise, but you do know that your trou-
bleshooting team will be able to help. So you assign his e-mail to the trou-
bleshooting queue. That way, the right people can give Mr. Wayne the right
answers. (For more on creating and managing queues, see Chapter 26.)
To assign an e-mail to a queue, follow these steps:
1. With the customer’s e-mail open, choose Actions➪Assign from the
menu bar (at the top of the window).
The Assign to Queue or User dialog box appears.
191
Chapter 16: Using E-Mail

2. Under Assign to a User or Queue, click the magnifying glass to the
right of the field.
The Look Up records dialog box appears.
3. Find the record you want as follows:
a. In the Look for field, choose Queue or User.
b. Either navigate to the record using the arrows at the bottom or
type your selection in the field next to Find and then click Find.
c. When you’ve found the record you want, highlight it.
d. Click OK.
You’re back at the Assign to a Queue or User dialog box. The field now
contains your queue.
4. Click OK in the Assign to a Queue or User dialog box.
You return to the customer’s e-mail.
5. Click Save and Close to assign the e-mail and save your changes.
The e-mail is assigned to that queue. However, it isn’t removed from
your activities list unless you reassign the owner.
Accepting e-mail
If you assign an e-mail to a queue (or user), it follows naturally that someone
will have to accept it, so let’s take a walk over to your service department.
Susie is your company’s Heavy-Duty Super-Sucker X1138 expert, and she’s
spotted Mr. Wayne’s e-mail in the queue she works with (the queue you
assigned it to). Or say you really appreciate Mr. Wayne’s business and want
the best expert to handle his vacuum problem; because Susie’s your expert,
you’ve asked her to look at the e-mail personally.
Here’s how you would go to that e-mail and accept it into your workload:
1. At the bottom of the main navigation pane, click the Workplace
button. Then, at the top of the pane, select Queues.
The Queues window appears.
2. Double-click the appropriate queue to open it.
Keep in mind that the Queues window shows In Progress and Assigned,
plus the queues of which this technician or user is a part.
3. Click the e-mail message you assigned to this queue to highlight it.
You can select multiple e-mail messages by holding the Ctrl key and
clicking.
192
Part III: Managing Sales 

4. In the window’s toolbar, click the Accept button.
The Confirm Assignment dialog box appears, asking for confirmation.
5. Click OK.
After the e-mails are assigned, the Confirm Assignment dialog box closes
and the queue is displayed again. The accepted e-mail is now in the In
Progress folder.
You can follow these steps also to accept e-mail in a user’s Assigned folder
under My Work.
If your assignments and acceptances of e-mail don’t show up in the work-
space right away, click the green arrows in the upper-right corner of the
workspace. This will refresh the workspace with the updated information.
Duplicate E-Mail Addresses
Microsoft CRM does not have duplicate e-mail checking, so you can enter the
same e-mail address in, say, both a contact and an account. When you send
an e-mail, the e-mail will not automatically link to both the contact and
account, despite the fact that they both have the same e-mail address.
For example, suppose you have Mr. Wayne as a contact and his Cobweb
Catchers business as an account, with the same e-mail address assigned to
both records. You can see the conundrum: When you send an e-mail, whose
history does it go under? Normally, it would default to the contact record’s
history. However, can you imagine trying to find the e-mail if you didn’t know
the name of the contact to which the e-mail was sent? You’d have to search
contacts and accounts.
Too much? Yes, we agree. You’ll be happy to know that this issue can be
easily solved. All you have to do is go to the Regarding field and select an
account (or contact or whatever).
When the account (or contact) is in the Regarding field, you can view the sent
e-mail in the History tabs of both the contact (Mr. Wayne) and the account
(Cobweb Catchers). Now it doesn’t matter whether you look under contacts
or accounts; the e-mail is in both places. This also ties in nicely with the next
section. (Subtle segue, isn’t it?)
Relating E-Mails to Other Records
So far, you’ve seen how an e-mail message may be related, or associated, with
an account or a contact. But did you know that you can relate that e-mail to
193
Chapter 16: Using E-Mail

other things, such as a contract or a quote? Here’s the full list of activities
and records (along with their chapter references) that you can relate to an
e-mail:
 Accounts (Chapter 13)
 Campaign activities (Chapter 22)
 Cases (Chapter 23)
 Contacts (Chapter 13)
 Contracts (Chapter 27)
 Invoices (Chapter 18)
 Leads (Chapter 17)
 Opportunities (Chapter 17)
 Orders (Chapter 18)
 Quick campaigns (Chapter 22)
 Quotes (Chapter 18)
Linking an e-mail to a record is just like correcting the problem of duplicate
e-mails mentioned in the preceding section. But we’ll go over the steps again
here:
1. On the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose New➪New
Activity➪E-mail.
The E-mail: New window appears. You can also link a received e-mail or
your own draft e-mail.
2. Fill in all the appropriate fields (To, Subject, and the like).
For details, refer to the “Creating Outgoing E-Mail” section, earlier in the
chapter.
3. To the right of the Regarding field, click the magnifying glass icon.
The Look Up Records dialog box appears.
4. Click the drop-down arrow to the right of the Look For field and select
one of the 12 record types in the list.
All available records of that type appear.
5. Double-click the appropriate record.
The Look Up Records dialog box closes, and your selection appears in
the Regarding field of the E-mail: New window.

Direct E-Mail
Every day, when I check my e-mail, I find that roughly 30 percent is legitimate
e-mails from business associates or friends, updating me on projects, current
events, and so on. The other 70 percent, unfortunately, is crrrrrrap! I do not
need to refinance my mortgage, find a date, aid dethroned despots in laun-
dering their 10 million dollars, or protect my computer from e-mail spam-
ming. (For one, that’s why IT guys were invented. And two, spam against
spam?!?) Heck, our office manager gets spam in foreign languages. How crazy
is that?
Now, I’m going to make an educated guess and say that you’re in the same
boat. The promise of easy, efficient, and inexpensive mass communication
has caused a feeding frenzy among a new breed of marketers. The spam’s the
bait, and we’re the suckers! At its worst, e-mail marketing has turned into an
irritating, insulting inconvenience, imposing itself right into the heart of our
workday.
195
Chapter 16: Using E-Mail
E-mail marketing or spam?
The world of e-mail marketing is a bit like the days
of the Old West; there was a code, there was
honor . . . okay, so maybe e-mail marketing isn’t
like the Old West. What I’m trying to say is that
there is a fine line (or a wide gray area) about the
rules. More than a few scoundrels are giving
e-mail marketing and the people who conduct it
a bad name. That said, they should not be allowed
to ruin the landscape for legitimate e-mail mar-
keters. We recommend that you consider a few
things when you’re ready to do direct e-mail
(a.k.a. e-mail marketing).
 Offer an opt-out: Whenever you send an
e-mail campaign (commonly referred to as a
blast), the body of the message should
include boilerplate text, usually at the bottom,
telling the recipient how he or she came to
be included in the mailing and offering the
recipient the option to be removed from your
mailing list.
 Update a field: Make sure that you process
all opt-out requests immediately by updating
the Contact Methods information. On a con-
tact record, click the Administration tab and,
under Contact Methods, check the box for E-
Mail: Do Not Allow. The same process works
for accounts. See Chapter 13 for more infor-
mation on adding and defining new contacts
and accounts.
 Be ready for bounces: Any client we’ve
worked with is surprised at how many e-mail
messages bounce (come back as undeliver-
able). So having a plan in place to clean up
these addresses is a good idea. The tough
part is that the plan usually requires a
manual process of locating the records
associated with the bounced e-mails and
contacting the accounts to update their
e-mail information.
With some planning and a little perseverance,
you can take advantage of this efficient and
highly cost-effective method of e-mail marketing.

On the other hand, we shouldn’t walk away from the potential to responsibly
market our products and services. If you follow a few basic rules and stick to
them, you have every right to take part in the wild world that is e-marketing.
Microsoft CRM has the ability to conduct mass e-mailings of messages to
your recipient lists.
Creating an e-mail template
Let’s touch briefly on templates. Basically, a template is an instrument of
communication (in this instance) where almost everything is done for you.
All that’s left to do is fill in the blanks.
With Microsoft CRM, you can define templates to your specifications or you
can use a predesigned template. Why would you want a template, you ask?
For a number of reasons, if only to prevent retyping information over and
over again. Templates are a great tool for letters and e-mail, especially if you
have a product or service for which people are constantly requesting infor-
mation. Make a template, pull it up to attach it to the e-mail when you’re
ready, fill in the blanks, and you’re ready to shoot it out to whoever asks 
for it.
In this section, you find out how to create an e-mail template and then merge
the template with a list of recipients:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Settings button.
2. Click Templates.
3. Click E-mail Templates.
The E-Mail Templates window appears, as shown in Figure 16-7.
4. In the window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The E-mail Template Type dialog box appears.
5. In the drop-down box for Template Type, make a selection.
Keep in mind that the template you’re creating here can be used only
with the selection you choose in this step. Basically, if you assign the
template type Leads, you would be able to send it only to customers
marked as leads.
6. Click OK.
The Template Type dialog box closes and the E-mail Template: New
window appears, as shown in Figure 16-8. The three required fields are
Type (which is filled out based on what you chose in Step 5), Title, and
Subject.

197
Chapter 16: Using E-Mail

7. Enter a title.
The title describes or names the template (for example, Summer Deal
Buster Template) and is used only for your company’s internal pur-
poses. That is, the title is visible only within Microsoft CRM and is not
seen in the e-mail body or by the recipient.
8. Enter a description for this e-mail template.
You might find it useful to include the purpose of the template or who
made it.
9. Enter your subject for the e-mail template.
The subject is for the e-mail body itself (for example, Now That
Summer’s Here, Do You Have Your Wake-n-Bake Breakfast-A-Go-Go Kit?).
This is the line your customers will see in their Inbox.
10. Click Save (the disk icon) in the upper-left corner of the window.
Use the Save icon, not the Save and Close button, to leave this e-mail
template open. We’re going to work on the body in the next section.
Adding data fields to a template
Body, body, body. Do you ever notice it’s easier to work on the body of a doc-
ument than it is on your own body? Of course, to some, creating an e-mail
template might be like running a marathon. Keep this in mind: The body of
your e-mail template is pretty much a blank slate, for you to customize as you
want with text, italics, color, and more.
One of the cool things that Microsoft CRM lets you do with its e-mail tem-
plates is to add data fields that pull information from contacts and accounts,
such as names and addresses. For example, you’re sending one thousand
e-mails regarding the Wake-n-Bake Set. If you define what information to pull
from the contact records, each person will see an e-mail personalized with
his or her name. In other words, you can create an e-mail template that has
the full name of the contact as its first line. In fact, full name is a data field we
use all the time.
Here’s how you create those data fields and add the information:
1. Insert your cursor into the body of the e-mail template you created in
the last section, and click the Insert/Update button on the toolbar.
The Data Field Values dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-9.
198
Part III: Managing Sales 

2. Click the Add button.
The Add Data Value dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-10. This is
where you tell the template which data fields to pull from the records.
3. In the Record Type field, choose an option from the drop-down menu.
4. In the Field list, select the field from which you want the program to
pull information.
5. Click OK.
Note that the data field you just chose has been added to your template,
but the Data Field Values dialog box remains open.

Data Value
dialog box.

parameters.
199
Chapter 16: Using E-Mail

6. To add additional fields, repeat Steps 2–5.
It’s important to know that if you want multiple data fields to appear on
your template, you must add each data field individually. If, for example,
you want to add fields to the Template for the Microsoft CRM User’s 
first name and last name, you must add each one separately — once to
create a data field for the first name, and again to create a data field for
the last name. If you add multiple fields to the Data Field Values dialog
box at one time before clicking OK, Microsoft CRM automatically adds 
a semicolon between each data field in the Template, treating it as an
either/or.
So, in the example of first and last name, Microsoft CRM looks for a 
first name and, if it finds one, displays it. If no first name is available,
Microsoft CRM looks for a last name and displays it. Microsoft CRM will
not display both first name and last name. With a little bit of practice,
you find out how intuitive this can be. An e-mail template can be all
things to all contacts, even if the data isn’t consistent from one record 
to the next. Thoughtful construction of the template results in the tem-
plate’s ability to look for data in a secondary field if the primary data
field is empty.
You can add dozens of data fields to an e-mail template. The Add Data
Value dialog box offers fields associated with the following record types:
user, account, contact, and opportunity.
7. Click OK to close the Data Field Values dialog box.
The dialog box closes, and you can see all the data fields added to the
body of your e-mail template. The data fields are highlighted in yellow,
surrounded by exclamation points and semicolons, and separated by
brackets.
8. Click the Save and Close icon on your E-mail screen.
The E-mail Template dialog box closes, and your template is saved. All
e-mail templates are visible in the Home: E-mail Templates window. The
subject of the template now serves as the template’s name.
Reverting to a personal e-mail template
Templates start out as organization-wide, but you can change them to per-
sonal e-mail templates. Here’s how:
1. While you’re still in the E-mail templates window, open a template.
2. In the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Actions➪Revert to
Personal.
3. Click Save (the disk icon) if you want to do some more work on the
template, or click Save and Close to return to the E-mail Templates
window.
200
Part III: Managing Sales 

Back in the E-mail Templates window, you’ll see that the Viewable By
column now says Individual for the template you converted.
4. To change the template back to where it can be viewed by the entire
organization, choose Actions➪Make Template Available to
Organization.
5. Click Save (the disk icon) to continue working on the e-mail, or click
Save and Close.
When you return to the E-mail Templates window, you’ll see that it now
says Organization under the Viewable By column.
Sending direct e-mail
Now that you know how to create templates, it’s time to send out the first
wave of your marketing campaign. Here’s how:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Sales button. At the top
of the pane, select Accounts.
You can also choose Service or Marketing in the navigation pane. You
can access the direct e-mail function also through the contacts listed
under each option.
2. Click the account to which you want to send the e-mail.
3. Click the Send Direct E-mail icon in the toolbar at the top of the list of
accounts.
The Send Direct E-Mail dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-11.
4. Select a template from the top pane.
All templates are designated as Global or Account Templates. Note that
when you highlight a template, its description appears on the right.
5. Choose a direct e-mail option from the following:
• Selected records on current page: The template will be sent to all
the accounts you had checked in the main display. You can select
multiple accounts by holding down the Ctrl key while clicking each
account.
• All records on current page: The template will be sent to all
accounts currently listed in the main display.
• All records on all pages: The template will be sent to all accounts
included in the selection in the View field in the upper-right corner
of the Send Direct E-Mail dialog box. For example, if the View is My
Active Accounts and there were enough such accounts to fill three
pages of the main display, this option would send the template to
the accounts on all three pages.
201
Chapter 16: Using E-Mail

6. Choose the user or queue sending the direct e-mail.
Use the magnifying glass to the right of the field to display the Look Up
Records dialog box, and then choose the user or queue.
7. Click the Send button.
The e-mail template is personalized to each selected account and sent.
Using Advanced Find to send direct e-mail
Suppose that you want to send direct e-mail to your clients in New York and
New Jersey. You can use Advanced Find to filter all your records for everyone
in those two states. Follow these steps to do just that:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Sales button. Then, at
the top of the pane, select Accounts or Contacts.
Remember, you can also follow these steps for Service and Marketing.
The Sales (or Service or Marketing) window appears with the accounts
or contacts you selected.
Figure 16-11:
Get to work
and send
direct

202
Part III: Managing Sales 

2. On the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Tools➪Advanced
Find.
The Advanced Find window appears, as shown in Figure 16-12. This is
where you define the values for your search.
3. Click the drop-down arrow to the right of the Look For field and select
Accounts.
The list has 49 items. Browse through them to see the available options.
The options in the Use Saved View field depend on the category you
select in the Look For field. Experiment by selecting various options in
the Look For field and then seeing your options in the Use Saved View
field.
4. Choose your search criteria.
a. Move your cursor to the word Select below the window’s toolbar
in the Advanced Find window.
A field appears with a drop-down menu.
b. Click the field to open the drop-down box.
c. Because we want to send our direct e-mail to all our New York
and New Jersey clients, select Address1:State/Province from the
options provided.
This tells Microsoft CRM that the search you’re about to conduct
will look first in the State/Province field.
Figure 16-12:
Use
Advanced
Find to set
up your
mailing list.
203
Chapter 16: Using E-Mail

Note that after you make the State/Province selection, the word Equals
appears next to it. To the right of Equals is the phrase Enter Value. The
options in this third lookup file depend on the choices made earlier in
Steps 3 and 4.
5. Choose the modifier.
a. Hover your cursor over the word Equals to display the field.
This should default to Equals, but always check before continuing.
We want Equals in this case, but you also have Does Not Equal,
Contains, Does Not Contain, and so on.
b. Click in the field to open the drop-down box, and select the
option you need.
6. Enter the value you want to search for.
a. Move your cursor over the words Enter Value, and click in the
field that appears.
Again, these options depend on choices made in the previous steps.
b. To follow along with the example, enter NY;NJ in the field.
By using the semicolon, you can define multiple possible values for
this field. For our example, we’ve entered: NY;NJ.
7. Click Save.
A window pops up, asking for the title of your search.
8. Enter a name for your search and click OK.
This convenient feature saves your search for future use.
Click the arrow by the Use Saved View field to see all saved searches.
Searches in System Views are available to everyone. Those in My Views
(including the one you just saved) are available to you.
9. In the Advanced Find window, click Find (in the lower-right corner) to
activate the search.
A new window appears showing you a list of all accounts meeting your
search criteria, as shown in Figure 16-13.
Now that you have your search results, here’s how to send a direct e-mail to
them:
1. Click the Send Direct E-mail icon at the top of the screen.
The Send Direct E-mail dialog box appears (refer to Figure 16-11). Remem-
ber, if you want to send your direct e-mail to a selection from the search
results, you must hold down the Ctrl key and click each record to select
them.
204
Part III: Managing Sales 

2. In the Account Templates list, select the template you want to send.
3. Choose who you want the e-mail to go to.
For details on these options, see Step 5 in the preceding section.
4. Next, choose the user or queue to send the direct e-mail from.
Use the magnifying glass to the right of the field to display the Look Up
Records dialog box, and then make your selection.
5. Click the Send button.
The Send Direct E-Mail dialog box closes, and you’re returned to the
Advanced Find window. Woo-hoo! Your e-mails have been sent.
You can use Advanced Find to search for records based on the values in sev-
eral fields. For example, you could search for all accounts in New York or New
Jersey (as we just did) that also have an e-mail address (“E-mail Contains
Data”). We recommend that you make this last condition (“E-mail Contains
Data”) a standard part of every direct e-mail campaign. After all, it’s a little
hard to send e-mail to someone with no e-mail address.
On that note, having the option to search for “E-mail Contains Data” or its
counterpart “Does Not Contain Data” is worth its weight in gold. The result-
ing list can tell who you should be contacting for e-mail information so that
they can be included in future e-mail merge campaigns.
Figure 16-13:
Voila! Your
search
results!
205
Chapter 16: Using E-Mail

Managing the unsubscribe request
Suppose you manage a mailing list, and several recipients have decided they
don’t want to get your informative and witty newsletter. You can have them
click an unsubscribe link in the campaign e-mail, which will set their record
to no longer receive e-mail marketing material. Then when you create a cam-
paign later, they will not receive e-mail — even if they are a member of the list
you selected.
To set this up, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click Settings. At the top of the
pane, click Organization Settings.
2. Click System Settings.
3. Click the Marketing tab.
4. Set the two auto-unsubscribe settings to Yes.
If you click Yes on the Subject option, you’ll be able to send an e-mail to
the folks who are requesting removal to verify their removal.
Note that you can edit the acknowledgment e-mail template in any way you
want. Then when you create an e-mail in a campaign, include something like
“Click here to no longer receive marketing material” at the bottom of the
e-mail. Highlight that text and click the Unsubscribe button in the e-mail’s for-
matting toolbar to change the text to a hyperlink. When the recipients click
that link in the e-mail, it changes the Send Marketing Materials field in their
records from Yes to No and also sends them the acknowledgment e-mail to let
them know they have been removed from the marketing list.

Handling Leads and Opportunities
In This Chapter

 Changing a lead to an opportunity
 Creating, assigning, and sharing opportunities
I
n CRM-speak, a suspect is a person or a company with whom you may do
business someday. In all likelihood, your suspect has not yet heard of you.
A prospect is the next level up. Your prospect has heard of you and may have
even expressed some interest in doing business with you. Microsoft CRM
refers to both suspects and prospects as leads.
An opportunity is a lead that has matured enough to deserve serious atten-
tion. But before you can begin to turn leads into opportunities, you need to
enter your lead data (such as contact information, the source of the lead, and
what the prospect is interested in) into CRM.
Actually, a lead can be promoted to either an account record, a contact
record, or an opportunity record. The subtle benefit of promoting a lead to an
opportunity is that you can forecast a sale associated with an opportunity.
Each opportunity is also linked to a price list, which helps determine the
pricing in a quote.
And just as you need to create a lead record before developing an opportu-
nity, you need to create an opportunity record before you close your oppor-
tunity (whether by winning or losing the deal). You create opportunity
records manually by just typing them in, by importing them from outside files
(such as Excel), or by converting them from leads.
Workflow rules enable almost complete automation of your selling process,
moving opportunities from one sales stage to the next. Workflow is part of
the process of handling opportunities and is discussed in some detail in
Chapter 8.
In Chapter 18, we discuss what happens when you close an opportunity and
turn it into the real deal. In this chapter, we talk about entering leads and
moving them through your sales process with the intention of turning them
into full-fledged opportunities.

Processing Leads from Suspects 
to Opportunities
Leads may come to you from many sources. Some of the most common sources
are referrals from existing customers, mailing lists you’ve rented or purchased,
inquiries from your Web site, and responses to marketing campaigns.
Leads get into CRM in essentially two ways. You can enter them manually or
you can import them, typically from an Excel file. You’re probably going to
enter leads manually if you have only a few sporadic leads or if you don’t
have them available in a convenient electronic format. In this section, we dis-
cuss getting leads into your CRM system and what to do with them after
they’re there.
Getting to the Leads window
Everything about leads and opportunities is accessed from the Sales module.
And everything about leads starts at the Leads window, which is shown in
Figure 17-1. To get to that window, click the Sales button at the bottom of the
navigation pane. Then, at the top of the pane, select Leads. That’s it.
Figure 17-1:
Your work
with leads
starts here.
208
Part III: Managing Sales 

As you go through the standard Lead windows, you can see about 20 data
fields. As with most data entry windows throughout CRM, many more fields
than that are available. Those fields have been hard-coded into the database
structure but remain invisible unless your system design people make them
available. In the case of lead records, for example, 95 fields are available,
should you need to track more information about your leads. Your adminis-
trator or dealer can add additional fields, if needed.
Creating a lead
Your marketing department’s efforts are supposed to create leads. Microsoft
CRM thinks of a lead as a potential customer that may or may not have
expressed interest in your company’s products. For example, the marketing
department might purchase a list of potential users. Or various types of
advertising might generate inquiries. In any case, the resulting contact infor-
mation has to get into the CRM database.
Unless you have an electronic list or your CRM system is hooked to your web
site, you’re probably going to be entering leads the old-fashioned way — by
typing. In this section, we discuss the easiest way to manually enter those
hard-won leads:
1. In the Leads window toolbar, click the New button.
The Lead: New window appears, as shown in Figure 17-2, with four tabs:
General, Details, Administration, and Notes.
2. Fill in at least the required fields, which are highlighted in red.
If the General tab isn’t already selected, click it. For the Topic field, enter
the product or service that the prospect is interested in.
The Company field is a required field, so you must enter a company
name even if your lead is an individual. When we encounter that situa-
tion, we simply enter X as the default company name. If you have the
name of an individual or any other relevant contact information, enter
that as well.
Although E-mail and Lead source are not system-required fields (in red),
they should be at least business-recommended fields (in blue). The
e-mail address is on the General tab, and the Lead source is on the
Details tab. Make sure you enter as much information as you can in the
General, Details, and Administration tabs.
3. When you’re finished, click the Save and Close button at the top of the
screen.
The system returns to the Leads window, where you can create another
lead, access a lead, or move on to another function.
209
Chapter 17: Handling Leads and Opportunities

Aside from the obvious contact information, such as company name, contact
person, and phone number, you should focus on collecting data that will
enable you to follow up both immediately and over the long term. E-mail
addresses and specific product interests are key ingredients to properly fol-
lowing up on a lead and are critical for campaign management and electronic
marketing. These two features, both of which are new to Version 3.0, are cov-
ered in Chapters 21 and 22.
Modifying a lead
You can modify a lead by navigating to the Leads window and clicking the
lead. Then make necessary changes in the various tabs of the lead’s record.
Remember to click Save and Close before leaving the record.
If the lead you’re interested in isn’t displayed in the list, check the View 
menu in the upper-right corner. This menu contains several options in its
drop-down list that expand or contract the number of listings displayed, as
shown in Figure 17-3. For example, if you’re looking for a lead that has not
been assigned to you, try selecting All Leads from the View drop-down list.
Figure 17-2:
Here’s
where you
enter
information
for new
leads.
210
Part III: Managing Sales 

Your lead may have been converted to an account, a contact, or an opportu-
nity. That’s good news, but it means you have to look under those record
types for your data. Accounts and contacts are discussed in Chapter 13, and
opportunities are described later in this chapter. If your lead has been dis-
qualified, refer to the upcoming “Resurrecting a lead” section.
Giving up on a lead
When you’ve decided that you have no hope of generating anything worth-
while from a lead, you can disqualify it. You do this as follows:
1. In the Leads window (refer to Figure 17-1), double-click the specific
lead you intend to give up on.
The General tab for that lead appears.
2. Click the Convert Lead button.
The Convert Lead dialog box appears.
3. To disqualify the lead, select the Disqualify option.
All the choices above the option become dimmed.
4. Select a reason for the disqualification from the list provided, and
then click OK.
Figure 17-3:
Expanding
the list of
leads.
211
Chapter 17: Handling Leads and Opportunities

Deleting a lead is possible but not recommended. Deletions are permanent,
and deleting a lead also deletes any attachments or notes associated with the
lead. A far better approach is to disqualify the lead. That way, an audit trail
(using that term loosely) remains if needed. And disqualifying allows you to
resurrect the lead later if the situation changes.
Resurrecting a lead
Occasionally you get lucky and a lead that you thought had died comes back
to life. If you disqualified the lead, you can bring it back without re-entering
all the old information. If you did not heed our advice — see the preceding
Warning — and instead deleted the lead, you are out of luck.
To resurrect a lead, perform the following steps:
1. In the upper-right corner of the Leads window, change the View selec-
tion to Closed Leads.
The lead you previously disqualified should appear somewhere in the list.
2. In the list, select the lead in question by double-clicking it.
The record for that lead appears.
3. On the menu bar at the top of the screen, choose Actions➪Reactivate
Lead.
The Confirm Lead Activation dialog box appears.
4. Click OK.
The original record appears. The data that had appeared dimmed while
the lead was disqualified is again available for editing and general use.
5. Click the Save and Close button and you are back in business.
The record is updated and the window closes.
6. Review the list in the Leads window to make sure that your lead has
been successfully brought back to life.
If you don’t see the lead immediately, click the Refresh button near the
upper-right corner of the window.
Turning a Lead into an Opportunity
Your goal is to turn all leads into opportunities. When you’ve reached that
goal, it’s time to turn your lead record into an opportunity record. Navigate
212
Part III: Managing Sales 

to the record for that lead, and then click the Convert Lead button at the top
of the screen. The screen shown in Figure 17-4 appears.
The first three conversion choices in Figure 17-4 are not mutually exclusive. If
you initially created a lead without establishing any related accounts or con-
tacts, you can do all three conversions in one smooth step now. Accounts
and contacts are discussed in Chapter 13.
If this potential sale is directly to a consumer (a person), select the Contact
option. If you are trying to sell something to a company, choose the Account
option. If you are dealing with a company, you can select the Contact in addi-
tion to selecting Account, in which case the system creates an account and a
related contact record.
An account is a company. A contact is a person. A customer might be either one.
The third option, Opportunity, converts your lead to an opportunity. If you
also elected to create an account record, that opportunity will be related to
it. If you did not create an account but did create a contact, the opportunity
will be related to the contact. If you had the system create both an account
and a contact, the opportunity (and the contact) relates to the account.
An opportunity record can’t stand on its own without an associated account
or contact.

Chapter 17: Handling Leads and Opportunities

Handling Opportunities
A fine line exists between a lead and an opportunity. Generally, you’ve
crossed the line when you’re able to forecast a sale with associated revenue,
a potential close date, and a probability for the sale happening. When those
conditions are met, you have graduated from a lead to an opportunity,
although your organization may define the transition differently. If you’ve
already written a quotation, you’re definitely over the line.
Creating and modifying opportunities
Converting a lead to an opportunity was covered in the preceding section. You
can also skip the lead record entirely and go directly to an opportunity record.
We like to do this when an existing client calls and asks for something — even
if we’re not ready to forecast a sale yet.
To create a new opportunity, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Sales button. Then, at
the top of the pane, select Opportunities.
The Opportunities window appears, as shown in Figure 17-5.
Figure 17-5:
All open
opportuni-
ties are
displayed.
214
Part III: Managing Sales 

2. In the Opportunities window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Opportunity: New window appears, as shown in Figure 17-6.
3. Enter a topic.
The topic, which is a system-required field, is just a description of what
you expect to sell, for example, Consulting, Term Insurance, or
Transporter System.
4. Select a Potential Customer (the second required field) to which this
opportunity relates.
Remember, a customer is either an account (a company) or a contact 
(a person). If you click the magnifying glass to the right of the Potential
Customer field, another screen appears that allows you to browse to 
and select either an account record or a contact record.
5. If you have a price list set up from BackOffice, select the appropri-
ate one.
Whenever you see the term BackOffice, by the way, you should think
accounting system. BackOffice integration is discussed briefly in Chapter 1.
6. For the Revenue field, if your price lists have been set up (see Chapter
10), select System Calculated; otherwise, select User Provided.
By the way, you are the user, so be prepared to enter a forecasted
amount.
Figure 17-6:

a new

215
Chapter 17: Handling Leads and Opportunities

7. Enter information in the following fields:
a. In the Estimated Revenue field, enter your best guess for the
actual revenue you will receive when you close the deal.
b. In the Probability field, enter a whole number between 1 and 99.
Although 0 and 100 are allowed, a 0 probability sale doesn’t
deserve to be an opportunity, and at 100 the deal must already be
closed and should have been turned into an order.
c. In the Estimated Close Date field, enter the date when you
expect to close the deal.
d. In the Rating field, enter a rating.
You can select Cold, Warm, or Hot to describe the rating, although
the Probability field already does a good job of rating.
Although none of these are system-required fields, you won’t have much
of an opportunity if you don’t have these estimates.
8. Click the Save and Close button to save the opportunity record.
From the Opportunities window, you can update an existing opportunity
record by double-clicking the particular record, editing the information in
any of the three tabbed areas (General, Administration, and Notes), and then
saving the record.
As your opportunity progresses through the sales cycle, you’ll want to
update often to maintain the current status of your real pipeline.
Assigning and sharing opportunities
You can assign an opportunity to one or more other users, and you can share
opportunities with other users or teams. For large or more complex opportu-
nities, this is often a necessity.
When you assign an opportunity to someone else, you change the record
ownership to that user. Sharing enables other users to see the opportunity in
their My Opportunities view just as if it were their own but does not change
the record’s ownership.
To assign an opportunity to another user, follow these steps:
1. On the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Actions➪Assign.
The Assign Opportunity dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 17-7.
Although you can assign one or more opportunities to yourself or to
216
Part III: Managing Sales 

another user, you cannot assign an opportunity to multiple users or 
to a team.
2. Select the second option, Assign to another user.
3. Click the magnifying glass to the right of the blank field.
A list of users appears.
4. Select the user to whom you want to assign this opportunity.
The blank field shown in Figure 17-7 is automatically filled in with that
user’s name.
5. Click OK.
The system returns to the General tab of that record, even though the
opportunity is no longer yours.
You share opportunities as follows:
1. In the Opportunities window, click the More Actions button.
A short list of options appears.
2. Choose Sharing.
The window shown in Figure 17-8 appears.
3. Select which users or teams you want to share this opportunity with
and what rights you want to give them.
Unlike assigning, sharing allows you to choose multiple users and even
teams of users. For each user or team, you can decide how much author-
ity to give. For example, you might decide to allow everyone to see the
opportunity but not make changes to it. Or, if you’re going away on vaca-
tion, you might share the opportunity with another user and give him or
her complete rights to make changes (Write) and to share the opportunity
Figure 17-7:
You can
assign an
opportunity
to yourself
or to
another
user.
217
Chapter 17: Handling Leads and Opportunities

with yet another user. Those choices and selections are shown in Figure
17-8. Chapter 5 has further details on security and rights.
4. Click OK after you’ve chosen the people or teams and their rights.
The system returns to the Opportunities window.
If you decide to share an opportunity, examine the permissions you grant to
other team members. For example, you may want to be judicious about allow-
ing other members the ability to delete or close an opportunity.
Relating opportunities to activities 
or other records
Opportunity records are often associated with many other types of records.
Opportunities can be, and should be, related to accounts, or contacts, or
both. This makes sense because you are planning to sell something to either
a company or a person. You may also want to relate activities, quotes, orders,
invoices, notes, or attachments to an opportunity.
While working on an opportunity, chances are you’re generating one or more
quotes, making notes, and saving documents or data files that are associated
with the opportunity. For example, in our business, CRM consulting, we often
Figure 17-8:
The

218
Part III: Managing Sales 

need to save sample data files so we can analyze how best to convert a
legacy system’s data into Microsoft CRM files. All these various files can be
linked to the opportunity record.
Here are the steps to link activities or files to an opportunity:
1. In the Opportunities window, click an opportunity record to see its
details.
2. On the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Actions.
3. Select Add Activity, Add Related, or Add a Note.
If you select Add Related, this associates a quote, an order, or an invoice
to the opportunity.
4. Click the Save and Close button.
Stages and relationships
Workflow rules automate your sales process — assuming your organization
has a process and the workflow rules have been set up to emulate that
process. Typically, a sales process has 3 to 12 stages ranging from initial con-
tact, to generating a quote, negotiating, and closing the deal. Every company
has a different process with different stages. In fact, a single company may
have a different process for every type of product or service it sells.
Setting up your processes is usually the domain of your sales management
team, an outside consultant, or a combination of the two.
From the Actions menu, you can advance an opportunity through your 
predefined sequence of sales steps. We highly recommend this approach, 
but an intelligently designed workflow is key. Workflow rules are discussed 
in Chapters 7 and 8.
The Relationships function enables you to link various accounts and con-
tacts. This is often important, particularly in more complex deals. For exam-
ple, you may have a pending deal with a prospect, and both an outside
consultant and a leasing company are involved. Because the consultant and
the leasing company are each separate records in your database, you would
use the Relationship function to link them.
From the Opportunities window, you would select the appropriate opportu-
nity, select Relationships from the navigation pane on the left, and begin
adding new customers to the opportunity.
219
Chapter 17: Handling Leads and Opportunities

Closing, reopening, and 
deleting opportunities
Eventually, whether you win or lose the deal, you need to close the opportu-
nity. This is easy enough to do. To close an opportunity properly, follow
these steps:
1. On the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Actions➪Close
Opportunity.
The Close Opportunity window appears.
2. Under Status, click the appropriate option to indicate whether you
won or lost the opportunity.
3. In the Status Reason field, select one of the drop-down choices.
Microsoft CRM provides two reasons for losing a deal: The order was
canceled or you were outsold. We’ve never seen a salesperson select
that second choice. Many other reasons exist for losing a deal, and your
system administrator or dealer should help expand this list.
4. Do one of the following:
• If you won, modify the Actual Revenue field to reflect the agreed-
upon price and then enter the Close Date.
• If you lost the opportunity, enter the competitor to whom you lost,
if you know that information.
5. In the Description field, enter a sentence or two with your final 
comments.
An example is shown in Figure 17-9.
Figure 17-9:
Closing an
opportunity.
220
Part III: Managing Sales 

6. Click OK to close the opportunity.
The system returns to the General tab of the opportunity itself.
A previously closed opportunity may resurface and need to be reopened. If
so, follow these steps:
1. In the Opportunities window, make sure the View menu displays
Closed Opportunities.
2. In the window’s list, select the appropriate opportunity.
The opportunity’s record appears.
3. On the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Actions➪Reopen
Opportunity.
The Opportunity’s status changes immediately, and you can edit it just
as you would any other active or open opportunity record.
You can also delete an opportunity. This may seem like a good idea, particu-
larly if you’re upset that you lost a deal. In the long run, however, it’s a bad
idea because you never know when a deal may come back to life or you may
need to refer to your notes on it. Don’t do it. Instead, close it and attach a
note if need be.

Generating Quotes, Orders, 
and Invoices

M
icrosoft CRM manages the entire process of generating quotations,
orders, and invoices. An essential ingredient in developing quotes is
the product catalog, which is described in Chapter 10. The product catalog
contains your list of products and their prices and discount structures.
Microsoft CRM’s quotation system draws from these products, prices, and
discounts to create pricing specific to each customer.
After you generate a quote and give it to a customer, the best scenario is that
the quote comes back as a signed order. The second-best scenario is that the
quote comes back for revisions. Even after a quote is converted to an order,
however, it can still be revised (until it has been sent to the accounting
system). After an order goes to accounting, it becomes an invoice.
Although the logical flow is from quote to order to invoice, you can also
create an order without creating a quote. And, in the same way, you can
create an invoice without having created either a quote or an invoice. 
As you can see, you can start anywhere in the cycle.
In this chapter, we cover how to use Microsoft CRM to create a quotation,
turn the quote into an order, and make the order into an invoice.

Creating and Activating Quotes
Several years ago we met with a very large distributor of paper products.
They had been in business for more than a hundred years and had a hundred
million dollars of revenue. Their entire quotation procedure was a verbal
system. They never even wrote down what price they had quoted. When the
customer called back to order something, the salespeople would simply ask
what price they’d been given! We never got the go-ahead on installing a quo-
tation system because they didn’t think such a thing could possibly work.
If your quotation system involves something more formal than just telling
your clients their price during a phone conversation, you need to generate a
formal, written quotation.
Most quotes go through more than one iteration. Initially, you create a draft
of your quote. You can continue editing your draft quote until it’s ready to be
sent. At that point, you activate the quote and send it to the customer. It is
now read-only.
You can make multiple revisions of an activated quote, and each revision is
stored as a separate record. The quote is then either accepted if it’s won or
closed if it’s lost. If it’s accepted, it is recorded as part of the order history.
Creating a quote
Most significant sales are preceded by a series of quotes or proposals. Many
people confuse proposals with quotations. Proposals are quotations on
steroids; they include a great deal more background, discussion, and analysis
in addition to the more typical one- or two-page quotation. CRM doesn’t have
a built-in proposal system, but you can find third-party proposal systems that
integrate with Microsoft CRM in Chapter 28.
To create a new quote, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Sales button. In the
upper pane, select Quotes.
The Quotes window appears, displaying all your existing quotes.
2. In the Quotes window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The quote record appears, as shown in Figure 18-1, with General,
Shipping, Addresses, Administration, and Notes tabs.
224
Part III: Managing Sales 

The quote ID is a unique, system-generated number that can help you
identify the quote later. The revision ID is also created and maintained
by the system and enables you (and the system) to track all the various
versions of quotes that you have created and activated. The quote ID
and revision ID fields are filled in after you save the quote. For that
reason, clicking the Save button (the disk icon) after you enter the
Name, Potential Customer, and Price List fields is essential. You do not
need to click Save and Close until you have filled in all the relevant fields
in each of the five tab areas.
3. In the Name field, enter some text that describes what this quote is all
about.
For example, you might type Microsoft CRM Training Class in Maui. After
you save all the details of the quote, the text in this Name field will
appear in Quotes window.
4. In the Potential Customer field, select an account or a contact to asso-
ciate with the quote.
To do so, click the magnifying glass to the right of the field to display the
Look Up Records dialog box for Accounts and Contacts. Alternatively,
you can select a customer from the Form Assistant on the right.
Whichever method you choose, select the appropriate record from 
the list and click OK. The system returns you to the General tab.
5. In the Price List field, use the magnifying glass or the Form Assistant
to select a price list.
Figure 18-1:

a new

225
Chapter 18: Generating Quotes, Orders, and Invoices

6. Now is a good time to click Save (the disk icon).
7. In the Totals section of the General tab, enter the Quote Discount and
Freight Amount.
Microsoft CRM calculates the total amount and displays it in the last
field in the General tab. Several fields on this screen, such as Detail
Amount and Pre-Freight Amount, are system generated. You can tell
because these field are outlined in black rather than blue.
8. Click the Shipping tab and fill in the following:
a. Enter information into the Effective From and To, Requested
Delivery Date, and Due By fields.
Each of these date fields has an associated calendar display just to
the right (see Figure 18-2). Clicking the calendar and then choosing
a date is usually easier than manually typing a date directly into
the field.
b. Enter the Shipping Method, Payment Terms, and Freight Terms.
Each of these fields has an associated drop-down menu. If your
system is integrated with an accounting system, these fields can be
filled in automatically.
9. Click the Addresses tab (see Figure 18-3) and enter the Bill To and
Ship To information.
To look up this address information, click the Look Up Address button
on the toolbar.
Figure 18-2:
The
Shipping
tab —
delivering
the goods.
226
Part III: Managing Sales 

If the customer will be picking up the items, select Will Call for the Ship
To option (the first option in the Ship To Address section).
10. If you want to associate your quote with an opportunity, start the
quote from the opportunity screen or do the following:
a. Click the Administration tab (see Figure 18-4).
b. Use the magnifying glass in the Opportunity field to find and
select that opportunity.
c. Click OK.
11. Click the Save and Close button to save your quote.
The system returns to the Quotes window.
Activating a quote
When you first create a quotation, it is officially a draft. You can modify the
draft as many times as necessary. But before sending the quote to a cus-
tomer, you must activate the quote. Follow these steps to do so:
1. In the Quotes window, select the quote you want to activate.
The details of the quote appear.
2. On the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Actions➪Activate
Quote.
Figure 18-3:
You don’t
always ship
to the same
place you
send the bill.
227
Chapter 18: Generating Quotes, Orders, and Invoices

The quote now becomes read-only and can be turned into an order when
the time comes.
3. To save changes and continue working, click Save (the disk icon); to
save changes and close the form, click the Save and Close button.
After you have activated the quote, it’s no longer a draft and the system cre-
ates an official quotation with its own quote ID number. If the customer then
requests a revision to the quote, you can modify that quote. The system
stores an additional record with its own revision ID for each modified quote,
so you may have a long series of quotes as you continue to revise activated
quotes.
The Effective To date is the date after which the quotation expires. It is meant
as a deadline by which the customer needs to make a decision. So what hap-
pens when the Effective To date has come and gone but the order has not
shown up? Nothing special, unless you have set some workflow rules or have
some reports that list expired quotations.
Associating Opportunities and Quotes
Opportunity records house all your sales forecast information. By associating
an opportunity with a quote, you allow the system to calculate the estimated
revenue for the opportunity automatically. As you revise an associated quota-
tion by changing products or discounts, those changes to the revenue stream
are reflected in your overall forecast.
Figure 18-4:

istrative

228
Part III: Managing Sales 

You can associate a quote with an opportunity or vice versa. If the opportu-
nity doesn’t exist yet, you need to create it before you can associate it with a
quote.
We’ll go through the steps of associating a quote with an opportunity record:
1. In the Opportunities window, select the opportunity that needs an
associated quote.
2. With the opportunity record displayed, click Quotes in the navigation
pane (under Sales).
A list of all associated quotes appears in the main window.
3. If no quotes are yet associated with the opportunity, click the New
Quote button in the window’s toolbar. If quotes already exist, you can
edit them if necessary.
4. Whether you are entering a new quote or editing an existing quote,
proceed with entering the information as detailed in Step 3 of the
“Creating a quote” section, earlier in this chapter.
5. Assemble the individual items you want listed in your quote by click-
ing Existing Products from the navigation pane or, if you’re quoting a
custom product or something that isn’t in the products list, select
Write-In Products from the navigation pane.
Because we started this exercise from an opportunity record, the quote we
just created is automatically associated with this opportunity. No need to do
any further association!
Printing a Quote
After you have finished developing a quote and have activated it, it’s a good
idea to do a quick Microsoft CRM print. Follow these steps:
1. From the Quotes window, select the quote you want to print.
Your quote record appears on the screen.
2. Choose File➪Print.
A preview of your quote appears so you can review it for accuracy.
3. When your previewed quote looks okay, you can send it to your
printer by clicking the print button.
Your bare-bones quotation prints, displaying the information from each
of the tab areas of your quote.
229
Chapter 18: Generating Quotes, Orders, and Invoices

Before printing, make sure your SQL Reporting Service is started.
In most cases, this information will not be formatted in your organization’s
style. The good news is that you’re not locked into a specific quotation
format. The bad news is that you need to create a format rather than select
from some canned ones.
Your system administrator or dealer can assist with the development of spe-
cially formatted printouts and reports.
Converting a Quote to an Order
A successfully presented quote becomes an order. Only a previously acti-
vated (status = active) quote can be turned into an order. The steps to
change a quote into an order are easy:
1. In the Quotes window, click the active quote.
The details of the quote appear.
2. In the Quotes window’s toolbar, click Create Order.
The Create Order dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 18-5. The
Status Reason of the quote has automatically changed to Won. You can
see the Status in the list of quotes as long as the View is All Quotes. The
opportunity is no longer part of your forecasted sales because it’s now 
a done deal. Today’s date is automatically filled in, although you can
modify this if necessary.
Figure 18-5:
Creating an
order.
230
Part III: Managing Sales 

3. Select the Close Opportunity option.
The opportunity no longer appears in the list of Active Opportunities
(that is, when the View is set to Active Opportunities).
4. In the upper part of the navigation pane, select Orders.
5. In the View drop-down list (in the upper-right corner), select My
Orders.
Your new order appears in the list. Good, so far!
Generating Invoices from Orders
When you’re ready to ship your goods or services to the customer, you use
the information in the order to generate an invoice to the customer. Follow
these steps:
1. In the lower part of the navigation pane, click the Sales button. In the
upper part of the pane, select Orders.
The Orders window appears.
2. Make sure the View menu (in the upper right) is set to All Orders.
3. Select the order you want to make into an invoice.
4. Click the Create Invoice button.
Microsoft CRM automatically generates and displays the invoice for you.
Unless your system is integrated to a Dynamics accounting application,
however, that invoice goes nowhere. Your invoice is typically printed (or
delivered in some other electronic way) from your accounting system.
5. Click Save and Close.
One of the most compelling things about generating quotes, orders, and
invoices is CRM’s ability to integrate with accounting software. The extent or
ease of this integration depends on the accounting software you’re using. If
you’re using Microsoft Dynamics GP, for example, Microsoft has the integra-
tion you need. If you’re using accounting software not from Microsoft, you’ll
probably need a third-party module to integrate the two. See Chapter 28 for
information on sources for this type of integration.

Setting Up Your Sales Literature
In This Chapter
 Adding sales literature
 Making changes to literature
 Relating literature to other records
 Adding and tracking competitors
T
he Sales Literature area is really a document management system. After
you set up your subjects (formerly known as the Subject Manager) to
provide the structure for your company’s document library, you can file indi-
vidual pieces of sales literature for future reference. (See Chapter 25 for full
details about how to set up the subjects.)
Subjects create an organizational structure for your literature, documents,
and brochures. Think of it as the Dewey Decimal System for your own library.
The Sales Literature area allows you to stock the shelves. And the shelves, by
the way, are on the server — not your local computer.
Other CRM packages enable a salesperson (or any user) to be on the phone
with a client and easily assemble e-mail attachments from the Sales Literature
area and send the documents. If e-mail isn’t the preferred communication
method, faxing or printing and mailing works.
Unfortunately, Microsoft CRM missed the boat here. After you put a document
into the Sales Literature area, all you can easily do is read the document. Well,
that’s not completely true. There is a multistep, cumbersome process whereby
you can browse the area, download the document to your local computer, and
manually attach it to an outgoing e-mail. But if organizing and reading your doc-
uments is what you have in mind, this chapter is for you.
You may also want to keep track of your competitors and their sales litera-
ture. This information is particularly important when competing for projects.
What you find out (even in a losing battle) may help you win the next one.

Adding Literature
All new literature must be categorized by subject. This means your subjects
must have already been set up with a structure to house your documents.
(As mentioned, see Chapter 25 for information on subjects.)
To add a piece of literature — or any document or file — to the Sales
Literature area, follow these steps:
1. In the lower part of the navigation pane, click the Sales button. In the
upper part of the pane, select Sales Literature.
The Sales Literature window appears, as shown in Figure 19-1.
2. In the Sales Literature window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Sales Literature: New window appears, as shown in Figure 19-2. This
is the main information screen for entering and cataloging your literature.
3. In the Title field, enter a title for your article.
4. In the Subject field, select a subject as follows:
a. Click the magnifying glass to the right of the Subject field.
The Look Up Records window appears.
b. Select a subject from the list.
Figure 19-1:
Your sales

appears in a
typical view.
234
Part III: Managing Sales 

5. In the Type field, click the arrow and choose an item from the list.
This list displays likely topic descriptions for your literature.
6. If you want, associate a user with this literature as follows:
a. Click the magnifying glass to the right of the Employee Contact
field.
b. Select an employee to associate with the literature. 
This is probably the person on your staff who developed the litera-
ture or the one who is responsible for the documentation.
7. In the Expiration Date field, click the calendar icon and select a date
for your document to expire.
For example, you may have a sale advertisement or a company policy
that expires on a particular date.
8. If you want, enter an abstract of the document in the Description field.
9. Click Save (the disk icon) or the Save and Close button.
If you select Save, the system saves what you’ve entered so far but
remains on this same New Literature screen awaiting further edits. If you
click Save and Close, the system returns to the Sales Literature window.
So far, you’ve only entered general information about the document. You still
need to attach the document to the listing you just created. Follow these steps:
Figure 19-2:
Entering a
new article.
235
Chapter 19: Setting Up Your Sales Literature

1. In the Sales Literature window, click the listing to which you want to
add one or more documents.
2. In the window’s pane on the left, select Documents (under Details).
3. In the window’s toolbar, click the New Document button.
The Document: New window appears, as shown in Figure 19-3.
4. Fill in the window as follows:
a. Title: Enter a descriptive title of the document, possibly including
a version number or a date.
b. Author: Enter either the author’s name or the name of the person
responsible for the document.
c. Keywords: Enter one or more keywords that can be used later 
to locate any document with one keyword or a combination of 
keywords.
d. Abstract: This is a short summary of the document’s contents.
e. File Name: This field connects Microsoft CRM to the stored file.
You can use the Browse button to the right of the File Name field 
to locate the document.
5. Click the Attach button in the lower-right corner of the window.
Figure 19-3:
Entering the
specifics for

236
Part III: Managing Sales 

Doing so attaches the document entered in the File Name field and
uploads the document to the server.
6. Click the Save and Close button at the top of the window.
The system returns to the listing of documents associated with this par-
ticular subject.
Each title can be associated with multiple documents. The structure is simi-
lar to an organization chart with each parent record capable of having multi-
ple children. For example, you might have a document with pricing and terms
and a separate document dealing with confidentiality associated with con-
sulting agreements.
All documents are stored on the server. If you attach a document that’s cur-
rently stored locally on your hard drive, Microsoft CRM makes a copy of the
document on the server. This way, other users (if they have access rights)
will have access to the document. When you need to retrieve the document,
you have a choice of downloading it from the server or just opening it
directly from the server.
Modifying Literature
Microsoft CRM copies documents to the server so all authorized team members
can use them. Therefore, at least two copies of the same document exist — one
on your local computer and one on the server. Users may have their own origi-
nal copy of the document on their own machine. Keep in mind that you want
everyone to always be working from the same version of the document.
Several document management systems allow multiple users to contribute to
the same document, more or less simultaneously. Even Microsoft Word has a
facility called Track Changes. Each contributor is automatically assigned a
color, and it is easy to see who has done what to the document. It’s also easy
to gracefully remove all signs of editing before printing the final edition.
You need one central repository for the current copies of all literature. That
could be the Microsoft CRM server, or it could be another readily accessible
server, as long as everyone understands where the active documents are
stored.
Assuming the CRM server is the central library for current documents, follow
these steps to edit an existing piece of literature:
1. In the Sales Literature window, click the row that contains the docu-
ment you want to edit.
The General tab for that subject appears (refer to Figure 19-2). You will
soon have access to the documents so you can edit one or more of them.
237

2. In the pane on the left, select Documents.
You see a listing of all the documents related to this subject.
3. Click the document you need to edit.
At the bottom of the window is a link to that document. This document,
or attachment, is housed on the CRM server.
4. Click the link to the document and save it on your local drive.
You can’t edit the document while it’s on the CRM server.
5. Edit the document and save your changes on your local drive.
6. Upload the document to the CRM server so other users can access it.
If you simply reattach the document, it will upload automatically.
Revision numbers are not automatically associated with revised docu-
ments, so you might want to include a revision number in the file name
or title of the document. In addition, you can track revisions, at least a
little, by checking the Modified On date that appears in the Sales
Literature window.
Relating Literature to Competitors
One of the more compelling aspects of the design of Microsoft CRM is the
ability to relate one kind of record to another. Suppose you want to associate
a piece of sales literature with a competitor. You collect sample brochures
from each of your competitors. You then catalog them in the Sales Literature
area and then relate each brochure to the appropriate competitor. To do this,
follow these steps:
1. In the lower part of the navigation pane, click the Sales button. In the
upper part of the pane, select Competitors.
A listing of all competitors appears in the window on the right.
2. Select the appropriate competitor.
The General tab for that competitor’s information appears.
3. In the pane on the left, select Sales Literature (under Sales).
The Sales Literature window appears, showing all existing sales litera-
ture associated with the competitor you selected.
4. Select the piece of literature that you want to associate with this com-
petitor by clicking the appropriate row in the list.
You can also set up a new piece of sales literature from here, as shown in
the “Adding Literature” section, earlier in this chapter.
5. In the window’s toolbar, click the Save button to save your association
of sales literature with the competitor.

Adding and Tracking Competitors
Whenever you’re in a competitive situation, knowing as much as possible
about the opposition is a good idea. You want to track their strengths so you
can anticipate the ammunition they will use against you. You want to know
their weaknesses so you can exploit them. Yes, it’s a tough world out there.
It’s a good idea not only to track the products they sell but also to compile as
much literature about those products as possible. Your competitor’s Web site
is a great place to go to compile, download, and cut and paste all the informa-
tion you can find. To add a new competitor to the database, follow these
steps:
239
Chapter 19: Setting Up Your Sales Literature
Finding your competitors
You may occasionally find yourself in a competi-
tive situation but not know exactly who your com-
petitor is. Maybe you know the general
geographic location of your competitor. The
Advanced Find feature may come to your rescue.
For example, if you are competing to sell computer
clones against another dealer somewhere in
Connecticut, you could use the specifications
shown in the figure to find likely contenders.
Choose Tools➪Advanced Find in the Competitors
window to access the Advanced Find feature.

1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Sales button. At the top
of the pane, select Competitors.
2. In the Competitors window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The data entry window shown in Figure 19-4 appears.
3. Enter at least the one required field, Name, and as many of the other
fields as you can.
Filling in the Key Product and Address fields may come in handy.
4. Click the Analysis tab.
The Analysis tab has five general, text-based topics for you to fill in. If
you’ve ever taken any Miller Heiman sales training, some of these topics
may look familiar.
5. In these five fields, enter everything you know or suspect about the
competitor.
6. Click the Save and Close button.
Compiling a library of your organization’s literature is one of the more useful
things you can do for the group. Whether it’s just for internal consumption
or, ultimately, for distribution to prospects and customers, having current lit-
erature organized in one place and available to everyone will speed up your
sales and support efforts. Do it and then make sure you keep it all up-to-date.

Using Notes and Attachments
In This Chapter
 Creating a note
 Adding an attachment
 Deleting a note or an attachment
A
lmost every type of record in the Microsoft CRM system enables you to
post notes and link attachments. Think of a note as information that you
manually type into the system. For example, if you find out that your main
contact at an account is about to leave, you probably want to document that
and create an action plan. Meetings and phone calls deserve this kind of
follow-up documentation as well. At our company, every meeting and phone
call and almost every kind of activity is documented with notes so we have
an audit trail of what has been promised or accomplished.
Attachments include a variety of files that are linked to individual records.
These files may be the typical Word documents or Excel spreadsheets, or
they may be PowerPoint presentations, digital photos, contracts, images of
faxes, and so on — almost anything.
In this chapter, you find out how to create and maintain notes and attach-
ments, processes that have been significantly streamlined in Version 3.
Creating Notes
Notes can be associated with any kind of existing record, whether it’s an
account, a contact, or a case from the Customer Service area. All these types
of records include a Notes tab. For example, Figure 20-1 shows the Notes tab
for a typical account record.

To create a new note relating to a particular account, follow these steps:
1. At the top of the navigation pane, click Accounts.
The system displays the Accounts window. We are using accounts here
as an example, but remember that what you do here applies equally well
to contact, lead, opportunity, and case records. In fact, almost every
type of record in CRM has a Notes field.
2. Select the specific account to which you want to attach a note.
3. Click the Notes tab at the top of the account’s screen.
4. Click the blue hyperlink that reads “Click here to enter a new note.”
5. Type your text in the rectangular area, as shown in Figure 20-2.
6. When you’ve finished entering text, click another tab or a selection in
the navigation pane.
The next time you return to the Notes tab for this account, you’ll see the note
you entered as well as the date and time and your name. This is one of the
few areas in Microsoft CRM where you don’t have to manually save your
work. You can see this in Figure 20-3.
Figure 20-1:
My notes for
the ENIAC
account.
242
Part III: Managing Sales 

Notes don’t have spell checking or grammar checking. If you’re challenged in
this department and think that others may end up reviewing your notes (and
they probably will), use Word to create your notes and spell check and gram-
mar check them there. Then either cut and paste the Word text into the notes
section, or attach the Word file, as explained in the next section.

243
Chapter 20: Using Notes and Attachments

Creating Attachments
Attachments are separate files that you may associate with individual
records such as accounts, contacts, opportunities, and cases. An attachment
could be a Word document, but it could just as well be, say, an electronic set
of blueprints, or a series of digital photos, or a spreadsheet.
You can add a note but not an associated attachment by using the Notes tab
at the top of most records. You can add a single attachment, but you can’t
make notes, by choosing Actions➪Attach a File. A better and more general
approach follows.
To add a note as an attachment, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the record to which you want to attach a note or a file.
2. On the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Actions➪Add a Note.
The Note: New window appears, as shown in Figure 20-4. The system
automatically fills in the Regarding field.
3. Enter a title in the small entry box (next to the word Title).
4. Enter a description in the large entry box (below the word Title).
The information you type in the larger field is displayed in the listing of
all associated notes — not what you enter in the Title field.

Part III: Managing Sales 

5. Use the Browse button to locate and select the file you want to attach.
6. Click the Attach button.
The system uploads your file to the server for storage. This gives other
users (with the proper access rights) the ability to see the file and also
gives you access to it from any other computer you may be using later.
You can attach only one file per note. All attachments are stored on the
server, so when you’re first attaching a file or using it in some way, the
system will need to move it using your Internet connection. Virtually any kind
of file is a candidate for an attachment. There are no size limitations, but if
you expect to be uploading or downloading these attachments from the
server frequently, try not to bog the system down with enormous files.
(Video clips, fax images, and the like are often pretty big.)
Deleting a Note or an Attachment
If you need to change the file attached to a record, perhaps because the file
itself has changed, you need to delete the original attachment. After an
attachment is attached to the note, you can delete the attachment by clicking
the Remove button.
To delete a note associated with a record, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the record.
If you were deleting a note associated with an account, for example,
you’d select Accounts from the upper part of the navigation pane and
then select the specific record from the Accounts window.
2. Click the record’s Notes tab.
All notes associated with this record appear.
3. Double-click the note you want to delete.
The text of the note appears.
4. On the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Actions➪Delete
Note.
The Confirm Deletion dialog box appears (see Figure 20-5), telling you
that you are about to delete not only this particular note but also any
associated attachment.
5. Click OK to proceed.
245
Chapter 20: Using Notes and Attachments

Deleting an attachment without deleting the associated note is now much
easier than in prior versions of CRM. Follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the record.
2. Click the record’s Notes tab.
All notes associated with this record appear.
3. Double-click the note with an attachment that you want to delete.
The text of the note appears.
4. Click the Remove button in the lower-right corner.
A confirmation screen appears with a warning that once you remove the
attachment it’s really gone. However, you can always reattach the same
file anytime you want to.
5. Click OK.
Another confirmation screen appears.
6. Click Save and Close to complete this action.
With regard to relating notes and attachments to other records — you can’t
do it. Notes and attachments are assigned to the one record they are initially
attached to — and that’s it. Sorry.

In this part . . .
M
arketing is a new feature in Version 3.0. Targeting
your accounts, which is covered in Chapter 21, is a
way to group just those accounts or records that have
something in common. For example, you could target
every customer or prospect in your state that might be
interested in a new line of products you’re about to
release. 
Any marketing person worth his or her salt wants to 
measure the cost and effectiveness of each marketing
campaign, so we cover that in Chapter 22.

Chapter 21
Targeting Accounts and Contacts
In This Chapter
 Setting up fields
 Developing your marketing lists
 Campaigning
W
hether you market to companies (accounts) or individuals (contacts)
or both, you need to plan the processes and the marketing campaigns
you have in mind. Although your campaigns will always evolve, certain fix-
tures are key ingredients. Your marketing needs to differentiate between sus-
pects, prospects, and current clients. You’ll target clients based on different
factors, such as how important they are, what products they have expressed
interest in or have already purchased, and perhaps the type and frequency of
communication they want.
Your exact marketing plan will determine what information you need to col-
lect and store in CRM. In this chapter, we define some typical fields that are
available or that you should add to your system.
After you collect the data you need for your marketing campaign, you need a
way to identify all the records within the groups you want to target. The new
Advanced Find feature in Version 3 allows you to save the search criteria for
different groups of targeted records. As a result, you can now have many dif-
ferent criteria set up to identify various target groups.
In this chapter, we mostly refer to accounts, but the concepts apply equally
to contacts and leads. After you’ve set up and populated targeted lists, you
can use these lists in your marketing campaigns. You get a taste of that later
in this chapter.

Important Fields for Targeting Customers
Although it may not be obvious, one of the most important pieces of data to
collect for each customer or prospect is whether or not you should be mar-
keting to them and, if so, through what medium. Microsoft CRM has a series
of fields you can use to indicate “if and how.” You can find these fields on the
Administrative tab of each account, contact, and lead record, as shown in
Figure 21-1. Interestingly, these same fields are nowhere to be found in an
Opportunity record.
You may want to have your system administrator or dealer add this same
series of marketing fields to the opportunity record. This makes sense
because the normal evolution of a record is to go from a lead record to an
opportunity record to a customer record.
Make sure to use these administrative fields conscientiously. More and more
laws are being passed regulating spam, opt-in/opt-out marketing, and the
divulging of contact details to third parties. If you violate these rules, your
marketing will probably not be a benefit and may create all sorts of trouble.

tive tab

250
Part IV: Making the Most of Marketing 

A good marketing plan has some key elements. You need fields to track the
following:
 What products the customer has purchased
 What products the customer is or may be interested in
 How important the customer is — this regulates how often you need to
be in touch
 Who handles this customer
 Who is the entrenched competitor and when their contract expires
Each of these pieces of data should be incorporated into a targeted market-
ing plan. You should probably have many targeted groups defined — for
example, one for prospects, one for current customers, and another for ex-
customers whose business you’d like to win back. With the workflow embed-
ded in Microsoft CRM, you can almost completely automate your marketing
campaigns. The rest of this chapter focuses on how to do exactly that.
Developing and Saving Marketing Lists
Marketing lists are groups of records that you can use with campaigns.
Campaigns can then be automated with workflow. The lists themselves can
be from account, contact, or lead records. You populate each list by manually
adding members (records) one at a time or by using the Advanced Find fea-
ture to compile larger and more complex groups.
Workflow refers to the overall flow of your business processes, whereas 
workflow rules are the specific steps you want CRM to take to implement a
business process. However, workflow and workflow rules are often used 
interchangeably.
Creating marketing lists
Before you can populate a list, you must create the structure for that list.
Essentially, that means you must name the list, add a few basic details, and
then save the list. Follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Marketing button. In
the upper part of the pane, select Marketing Lists.
The Marketing Lists window appears, as shown in Figure 21-2.
251
Chapter 21: Targeting Accounts and Contacts

2. In the window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Marketing List: New screen appears, as shown in Figure 21-3. Three
fields are required: Name, Member Type, and Owner.
3. In the Name field, enter a unique name for your new list.
4. Select a Member Type from the drop-down list.
The Member Type simply indicates whether you are building the list
from your accounts, contacts, or leads. You can only use one of these
per list.
5. Enter information in the other fields, as desired.
If you plan to track your marketing based on this list, you should fill in
the Source field (where you initially got these records) and the Cost field
(how much you paid for these records). You can enter notes either in
the Description field or in the Notes tab. If you use the Notes tab, each
note is date- and time-stamped.
6. Click the Save and Close button.
You return to the Marketing Lists window, which now displays your new
marketing list.
Now you have a list, but it has no records in it yet. The next sections describe
two ways to populate your list.
Figure 21-2:
All your

252
Part IV: Making the Most of Marketing 

Populating a marketing list using Look Up
The Look Up feature is the simplest way to build a list. If your intent is to
build and maintain the membership in a list based only on the name of the
account, the Look Up feature may be all you’ll need. It probably won’t be
enough for every list, but it’s a good place to start for the simple ones.
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Marketing button. At
the top of the pane, select Marketing Lists.
2. Click to select the marketing list you want to populate.
The same screen you were just working on (see Figure 21-3) appears, but
now the Members selection in the navigation pane is available.
3. At the top of the navigation pane, select Members.
The screen in Figure 21-4 appears.

5. Click the first option, Use Lookup to add members, and then click OK.
The Look Up Records dialog box appears.
6. In the Look For field, enter the name of the account(s) you want to
add to your list.
You can enter all or part of the name. We entered *aa*. The asterisk (*)
is a wildcard that matches any sequence of characters. The aa finds any
account record whose name has two sequential a’s in it. The characters
are not case sensitive.
7. Click the Find button.
All the accounts with aa in their name appear in the Available records
pane, as shown in Figure 21-6. This list may include records you don’t
want. For example, the figure shows four AA baseball teams (the records
we wanted) as well as a pawnshop we don’t want to include.
8. Highlight the records you want to include in your marketing list, and
then click the >> button.
You can use the Shift key or the Ctrl key to include multiple records.
9. Click the OK button when you’re finished.
The system flashes a message, telling you that it’s adding records to
your list, and then returns to the Marketing Lists window.

255
Chapter 21: Targeting Accounts and Contacts

Populating a marketing list 
using Advanced Find
The next step up in sophistication is to use Advanced Find rather than the
simpler Look Up feature to build a targeted list. These two methods have sev-
eral key differences:
 Advanced Find can look at any field in a record, not just the Name field.
 Advanced Find can look at more than one field in a search. For example,
Advanced Find can locate all the accounts in New York that also have fax
numbers.
 You can save criteria you create with Advanced Find and use them again
later.
To create a targeted list using Advanced Find, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Marketing button. 
At the top of the pane, select Marketing Lists.
2. Click to select the marketing list you want to populate.
3. At the top of the navigation pane, select Members.
4. In the window’s toolbar, click the Manage Members button.
The Manage Members dialog box appears.
5. Click the second option, Use Advanced Find to add members, and
then click OK.
6. Select the type of record on which you are basing your search.
In this example, we are using account records and looking for all
accounts that contain aa in their name and also have a fax number. See
Figure 21-7.
7. In the window’s toolbar, click Save As.
The screen shown in Figure 21-8 appears
8. Fill in the required Name field and add some descriptive text.
9. Click OK to save this new entry as one of your marketing lists.
No matter which method you use to create a marketing list, your list is static
rather than dynamic. This means the list contains only those records that you
just added; it does not automatically update as you add or change records. If,
for example, you add five more baseball teams to your database, they are not
automatically included in the baseball list. You must add these five to the list
if you want them to be part of your marketing plan. In Figure 21-5, the fourth
option allows you to use Advanced Find to perform this update.

Developing Campaigns and 
Quick Campaigns
Although you can send e-mails and faxes to individual customers, the real
power of a marketing system is the marriage of marketing lists with market-
ing campaigns. After you develop a target list with either of the two methods
just discussed, you can easily create a quick campaign to send out informa-
tion or schedule activities. This is a powerful tool that has been greatly
expanded in Version 3.

Chapter 21: Targeting Accounts and Contacts

In addition to regular campaigns, which allow you to track associated
finances and results, Microsoft CRM has linked a Quick Campaign Wizard to
the marketing lists. After you create a target list, using the wizard is a logical
next step.
If your goal is to track what you’re spending on each campaign, and to track
the results as well, stick with the full-fledged campaign system described in
Chapter 22. If you want to send out a quick e-mail or fax blast, or schedule
phone calls to all the members of a target list, the Quick Campaign Wizard is
the tool for you.
After you’ve created a target list, it’s easy to link it to a quick campaign. The
wizard guides you through the entire procedure:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Marketing button. At
the top of the pane, select Marketing Lists.
2. Highlight the specific list (or lists) with which you want to associate a
quick campaign.
3. In the window’s toolbar, click Create Quick Campaign and choose For
Selected Records from the drop-down list (it’s your only choice).
The Quick Campaign Wizard launches and displays the screen shown in
Figure 21-9.
Figure 21-9:

Part IV: Making the Most of Marketing 

4. Follow the wizard’s instructions as it guides you through the setup of
the Quick Campaign.
Figure 21-10 is the most detailed screen during the process of setting up
an e-mail blast. CRM saves you the trouble of filling out most of these
fields by filling them automatically. Following is a description of the ones
that you should fill in manually:
a. Owner: This required field is automatically filled in by the system,
although you can manually change it if you need to.
b. Duration: This is an indication of how long the entire campaign
should take.
c. Priority: Your choices are Low, Normal, and High. These selections
do not trigger any system-generated selections; they just give you
the ability to prioritize your day. 
d. Due: This is a two-part field containing a date and a time when the
campaign should begin.
Figure 21-10:

Chapter 21: Targeting Accounts and Contacts

e. Category and Sub-Category: These two fields allow you to further
define the campaign. You might enter something like “Service
Contract Renewal” in the Category field and “Focus Customers” in
the Sub-Category field.
5. Click OK to exit the wizard.
When you complete all the screens in the wizard, the system returns you
to the listing of all your quick campaigns. Each line in the listing includes
the current Status Reason of the campaign, as shown in Figure 21-11.
6. Click the icon to the left of any subject in Figure 21-11.
You see an area with additional reporting on the quick campaign, as
shown in Figure 21-12.
The marketing module of CRM provides you with a solid tool for staying in
touch with prospects and customers. Integrating targeted account lists with
well-designed workflow creates a powerful automated marketing system that
will help build your business and reduce your manual workload.

L
et’s talk campaign management — no, we’re not leading 30,000 foot sol-
diers to take Carpathia. (Think of the logistics of that campaign!) We’re
talking about managing your marketing and sales campaigns using Microsoft
CRM’s campaign management. Use it wisely, and it will help you lead an orga-
nized campaign and (we hope) increase your profits and customer base.
The thorough and powerful Microsoft CRM campaign management feature
helps you through the campaign planning process itself, tracks campaign
costs and results, and allows links to other parts of the program, such as
products and sales literature. Microsoft CRM also lets you adjust your cam-
paign on the fly. Is your supplier offering a new incentive? No problem. You
can easily incorporate that new discount or new product into the current
campaign.
So let’s go basic here: Campaign Manager allows real-time modification of
your campaigns. Your marketing folks can access sales information and look
at each step in the campaign. On the other side, your sales department is
enjoying life because they can finally see what the customers are getting,
without having to bribe Mel the marketing assistant. We know, we know.
You’re saying that having the sales and marketing departments talking to one
another can’t be done. I bet that’s what someone told Orville and Wilbur
Wright too, once upon a time.

Planning Your Campaign
As with most things in business, your marketing campaign will work better
for you and provide more satisfying results if you plan. Now, actually plan-
ning the campaign is outside the scope of this book, so we’ll touch on the
basics of marketing plans and take a moment to shamelessly plug Small
Business Marketing For Dummies and Marketing For Dummies, 2nd Edition. 
For the rest of this chapter, we’ll focus on building your marketing campaign
using Microsoft CRM.
Even though we’re leaving the planning of your marketing campaign to the
experts, we should touch on a few things, just so you have a reference point
for stuff mentioned later in the chapter. Microsoft CRM lets you plan a cam-
paign that can be as manual or as automated as you like. A manual campaign
is one in which someone has to go into the system and launch the letters,
e-mails, or mailing. This option offers you the most control and flexibility.
On the flip side, say you want to set up a campaign so that all you have to do
is go in every week, make sure things are on track, and go back to work —
that’s the automatic version. You can set up the campaign steps to launch
automatically. For example, suppose you want to notify customers when their
help-desk agreements are about to expire. You can set up a campaign to run
automatically so that these customers receive a notice 30 days before expira-
tion, then another notice 15 days before expiration, and then a stop-the-
presses e-mail the day before expiration. If you define the campaign well, you
can set it up so that clients who have renewed do not get another reminder.
The following list outlines several other important aspects of your marketing
campaign:
 Track budget versus expenses: Money, money, money. Your budget is
extremely important, and you’ll want to make sure you have one estab-
lished before you start. Then, as the campaign progresses, the cost is
automatically calculated in Microsoft CRM. You can enter and adjust
information for the total budget of the campaign, the expected revenue,
miscellaneous costs, or the total actual cost.
 Assign promotion codes: Remember these? The coupon says “Enter
Code FREEBIE9 online.” Plug it in and bingo, you get that free travel mug
or a discount. When you assign promotion codes and people respond
with them, you can use them to measure the effectiveness of your cam-
paign (by tracking the resulting lead and sale back to the campaign).
This feedback allows you to improve your marketing processes.
 Target products: Microsoft CRM will let you associate products and
price lists with your campaigns so you can easily link to other areas of
Microsoft CRM. This ramps up your Microsoft CRM to a truly integrated
campaign management tool.

Part IV: Making the Most of Marketing 

 Define lists: Do you want everyone in Alaska or do you want everyone in
California? If you’re selling parkas, Californians might not be the best
group to target. You get the picture: The right list is always a critical part
of a campaign. You can build detailed and drilled target lists using
Advanced Find searches, based on almost any combination of data that
you’re tracking in your system.
 Collect marketing material: Put together the product brochures, promo-
tional fliers, tchotchkes, or sales coupons for your campaign. Some of
our favorites are a talking starfish from a hotel/resort chain (you slap it
and it says “WHOA! You can do that?”). Another company sent us a pair
of drumsticks to announce their new product release (and our office
manager has threatened to hide them). Most people love to save money,
so coupons attract attention.
As you can see, marketing and sales campaigns have fingers in almost all
parts of your Microsoft CRM system, from price lists, to sales literature, to
tracking leads and incoming sales.
If you’re still waiting for some of your marketing materials to arrive, we rec-
ommend creating blank documents with the correct titles so you can at least
have a framework for your campaign. You can always go back and put in the
correct items later. And whatever you do, do not put racy or offensive mes-
sages on these blanks, even as a joke. It’s been well documented that the
Minions of Chaos will take this scenario and run with it, leaving you and your
company in the hot seat.
You’ll also want to set your revenue target and the starting and ending dates
of your campaign. We suggest that you put all this together in an outline
before building your campaign. That way, you can see any holes in your cam-
paign before they become an issue.
Creating Campaigns
Now, let’s say you have a plan and a budget, you successfully countered all
the points your boss brought up, and you even managed to get all your mate-
rials ordered. The only thing left to do is follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Marketing button.
Then, at the top of the pane, click Campaigns.
The Campaigns window appears, as shown in Figure 22-1. (You can get
here also by clicking Workplace in the navigation pane and then clicking
Campaigns, under Marketing.) Click the arrow to the right of the View
field to display the following categories of campaigns: All Campaigns and
Campaign Templates, Campaign Templates, Launched Campaigns, and
My Campaigns.
265
Chapter 22: Managing Campaigns

2. In the window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Campaign: New window appears, as shown in Figure 22-2. By
default, the window appears with the General tab selected. As with most
fields in Microsoft CRM, the bold (red on your screen) fields are manda-
tory. If you take a look at the navigation pane, you’ll see that you are in
the Details section. The other options and sections become available
when you save the campaign.
3. Enter a name for your campaign.
4. Click the arrow to the right of the Status Reason field to select an
option from the drop-down box.
Because we’re creating a campaign here, we want Proposed. After your
campaign is defined and everything is in place, you can change the
status to Ready to Launch. The other options are self-explanatory.
5. Enter your Campaign Code.
You can enter a code (perhaps as part of a marketing gimmick) or let the
program assign the code (just leave it blank for now). The campaign
code helps you link responses to the campaign for those important
reports and demographic data.
6. Choose your Campaign Type.
Use the arrow to the right of the field to open the drop-down box. Your
options are Advertisement, Direct Marketing, Event, Co-branding, and
Other.
Figure 22-1:
All cam-
paigns start
here.
266
Part IV: Making the Most of Marketing 

7. Next, enter your expected response.
This is where you would put the expected number of responses. For
example, if you’re sending 500 mailers and expect a 1 percent response
rate, you would put 5 here. This allows you to measure the actual
response rate against what you estimated.
8. Select a price list to associate with this campaign.
Even if you don’t fill in any of the other optional fields, we recommend
that you at least choose a price list so that the campaign has something
to work from.
9. In the Offer field, describe your offer.
10. Click Save (the disk icon).
Your data is saved, and you can move on to the other tabs.
Now enter information on the Financials tab as follows:
1. Click the Financials tab (see Figure 22-3).
2. Complete the Budget Allocated, Miscellaneous Cost, and Estimated
Revenue fields.
The other two fields (Total Cost of Campaign Activities and Total Cost 
of Campaign) are calculated automatically as you define and run your
campaign.
Figure 22-2:
Technically,
building
your
campaign
starts here.
267
Chapter 22: Managing Campaigns

3. Remember to click Save (the disk icon).
We suggest that you save your data each time you move to a new tab or
option within your campaign.
After you’ve entered your financial information, you can either click the Save
and Close button or enter notes in the Notes tab.
The Administration tab contains basic campaign administration notes
(Owner, Created date, date of last modification, and who did the change),
which are filled in automatically. The only field you can edit on this tab is
Owner. The Owner field defaults to the logged-in username; you can change
the owner by clicking the hourglass to the right of the field.
Now, let’s take a look at those now active options in the navigation pane
(refer to Figure 22-3). These will help you tune your campaign from the family
station wagon into a hotrod.
Planning Tasks
Consider this section as your campaign check list. In the Planning Tasks area,
you can enter as many tasks as you need to, whether it’s ordering the
tchotchkes, picking up paper, selecting graphics, and more. You can also
Figure 22-3:
Money
makes the
campaign
go round.
268
Part IV: Making the Most of Marketing 

complete or close tasks from this area and keep track of where you are in
processing the campaign. All tasks you add here are also added automatically
to your Outlook task list, so you can keep them in a central place. Let’s take a
look at entering a planning task:
1. Get to an open campaign window (like the one we created earlier).
2. In the navigation pane, select Planning Tasks.
The Planning Tasks window appears, as shown in Figure 22-4.
3. In the window’s toolbar, click the New button to create a new task.
The Task: New window appears, as shown in Figure 22-5. This window is
similar to the one you see when scheduling activities (see Chapter 14).
4. Fill in the Subject and Owner fields, which are required.
5. Fill in the Regarding field.
Why would you want to do this? Easy. Say your task is to obtain a mail-
ing list from Listzilla. By selecting Listzilla in the Regarding field, you can
link this task to that contact and still have the task listed under the cam-
paign. The cool thing here is that you don’t have to link to just contacts.
You can link to other Microsoft CRM records, such as cases, contacts,
and leads.
6. If desired, fill in the remaining optional fields.
Remember, the more information you have, the better you can complete
a task.
Figure 22-4:
Setting up
campaign
tasks is
easy.
269
Chapter 22: Managing Campaigns

7. To add notes to this task, click the Notes tab and enter away.
As with other note fields in Microsoft CRM, you can enter information
free-form.
8. Click the Save and Close button.
This saves the task and returns you to the planning tasks workspace.
Campaign Activities
Campaign Activities is the next option in the navigation pane of your open
campaign window (see Figure 22-6). Here, you can list the phases, or waves,
of your campaign, select target literature, or distribute campaign activity.
To create a campaign activity, follow these steps:
1. With a campaign window open, click the New button.
The Campaign Activity: New window appears, as shown in Figure 22-7. In
this window, the Parent Campaign, Subject, and Owner fields are
required. The Parent Campaign and Status Reason fields are filled in
automatically.
Figure 22-5:
See what
we mean?

Chapter 22: Managing Campaigns

2. Select a Channel using the arrow on the right of the field to open the
drop-down box.
This is where you tell the program how you want this phase carried out:
phone, fax, letter, e-mail, appointment, and so on. To clarify, this is not a
marketing channel, such as direct marketing or distribution. By the way,
this selection must be made to distribute campaign activities, a topic
covered later in this chapter.
3. Choose a type for this campaign activity.
The Type is the purpose of the campaign activity, such as research or
lead qualification.
4. Enter a subject for your campaign activity.
Although you can call the activity anything you want, we suggest that
you keep the subject logical and self-explanatory. Calling your campaign
activity ‘Fluffy Bunny Slippers” tells people nothing unless you’re really
sending out fluffy bunny slippers.
5. Fill in the open field under the Subject field.
This is a free-form area for notes or a description for your campaign
activity. We’ll flog the developers later for not labeling the field.
6. Choose an owner.
The Owner field automatically defaults to the user creating the cam-
paign activity, but you can change it. If you want to delegate tasks in the
campaign, this is where you do it. Assign the owner here, and the task
appears in the owner’s activities.
7. Assign an outsource vendor.
Use the magnifying glass to search for and select a vendor. For example,
if the local printing company, Ink, Inc., is printing the invitations to your
webinar, they are your outsource vendor.
8. Choose a scheduled start and end date.
This is self-explanatory. To the left of these fields, you’ll see Actual Start
and End Date, which are not enabled. These are filled in automatically
when you start the campaign.
9. Fill in the Budget Allocated field with the cost of your budget.
This way, you can check your budget at a glance instead of having to
e-mail folks or rifle through papers on your desk. The companion field to
the right, Actual Cost, is just that — the actual tally of everything related
to this campaign.
10. Fill in the Priority field.
11. Click Save (the disk icon) or the Save and Close button.
Remember, if you want to do some more work on the campaign activity,
just click Save. Your campaign activity will be saved and the option in
the navigation pane will be enabled.
272
Part IV: Making the Most of Marketing 

Marketing always walks a fine line, especially today, with people highly sensi-
tive to spam and their rights as a consumer. So what should you do when you
want an aggressive marketing campaign but not one so aggressive that people
become tired of receiving stuff from you and immediately circular-file it? At
the bottom of the campaign activity window, take a look at the Anti-Spam
Setting area. Basically, you enter a number of days, and the system will auto-
matically scan and not contact (that is, generate letters or e-mail, schedule
calls, and so on) those clients who have had contact in that many days. Not
only does it make customers happy by not overloading their inbox, it makes
your company look more on the ball. You’re not sending a third request or
marketing wave if the person calls after the second one and gets in the
pipeline.
Let’s take a look at the other option in the Campaign: New window, Target
Marketing Literature. This option refers to the documents you are going to
send in this activity and have already associated with this campaign. (You
find out how to add literature to a campaign later in this chapter.)
Tacking literature onto the campaign at this point is pretty simple:
1. With the campaign window open, click Add from Campaign.
The Look Up Records dialog box appears, so you can search for the 
document.
2. When you find the document, double-click the right-pointing arrow to
move it over to the selected pane.
3. Click OK.
You return to the Campaign Activity: New window.
Now let’s say that your campaign includes making telephone calls. You 1,000
leads and 25 phone-call makers. Those making the calls are not necessarily
salespeople; you could have qualifiers making the calls and then directing
them to salespeople. How to get those phone calls scheduled to all 25
people? Yes, the logistics can choke even a skilled planner. We know you
value your staff and don’t want them choking, so eyes up to the main toolbar
and the Distribute Campaign Activity button.
Because calls are the most common items that require scheduling en masse,
you take a look at how to handle that task in the following:
1. In the main toolbar, click the Distribute Campaign Activity button.
The box that appears depends on the channel you selected in Step 3 in
the steps at the beginning of this section (see Figure 22-7). Because we
selected Phone as the channel, the New Phone Calls dialog box appears,
as shown in Figure 22-8.
273
Chapter 22: Managing Campaigns

2. Enter the subject.
Subject is a mandatory field. You might call this Seminar Invite or
Qualify Prospect. Basically, the subject is a description of the activity
you’re distributing.
3. In the bottom-right corner, click Distribute.
Again, the dialog box that appears depends on the channel you chose to
deliver this activity. Because we’re using a phone call as our channel,
the Distribute Phone Calls dialog box appears. You have two options
here to indicate the Owner (the person the call is being assigned to) of
the phone call:
• The owners of the records in the target marketing lists
• I will own the new phone calls
4. Click OK.
You return to the campaign activity window. Take a look in the navigation
pane, where you’ll see added options to help you track this distribution.
5. Click Save (the disk icon) or the Save and Close button.
Voila! You’re done!
Figure 22-8:
Adding
phone calls
as activities.
274
Part IV: Making the Most of Marketing 

The phone-call option and channel will track where the phone calls went and
how many failed attempts were made. As you can see, Microsoft CRM makes
campaign scheduling especially easy for those in large companies and those
who handle a large number of activities for marketing campaigns.
Campaign Responses
When you create a marketing campaign, you expect results or responses,
whether they’re negative or positive. There are even folks dedicated to deter-
mining response rates, filtering that information into percentages, and
making little pie charts and bar graphs from those responses. Good news or
bad, you can record it in Microsoft CRM.
Another little bonus to being able to record your responses in a central
system like this is that your sales department and your marketing depart-
ment can see the same information! Whoa! Who doesn’t want their depart-
ments working together, in sync and harmony? (Okay, maybe not harmony as
the marketing department stomped the sales department last year in the soft-
ball game, but you get the picture.)
Excited now? Good. Here’s how you (or your sales staff) can record those
responses:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Marketing button. At
the top of the pane, click Campaigns.
2. In the Campaigns window, double-click your campaign.
The campaign window appears.
3. In the navigation pane of the open campaign window, click Campaign
Responses (see Figure 22-9).
4. In the window’s toolbar, click New.
The Campaign Response: New window appears, as shown in Figure 22-10.
Most of the fields are self-evident, but we’ll touch on some of them here.
You may complete them as appropriate using the magnifying glass to the
right of a field or the Form Assistant (which is collapsed in Figure 22-10).
• Response Code: This indicates the response of the customer. You
can choose from: Interested; Not Interested; Do Not Send
Marketing Materials; Error.
• Promotion Code: You can link the response to a particular promo-
tion. If the customer is calling because of the free bunny slippers,
for example, you can indicate that here. Several campaigns could
have the same promotion, so this is just another way of grouping
data for marketing analysis.
• Customer: This can be an account, a contact, or a lead.

Part IV: Making the Most of Marketing 

5. When you’ve completed the form, click the Save and Close button.
The Campaign Response window closes, and you return to the open
campaign window.
By recording campaign responses, you can easily check the status of each
campaign throughout its lifespan. This is a great feature, because you can
see, for example, whether one promotion is taking off or a certain employee
is having trouble making calls.
Target Products
Your target products are the products and services targeted by this cam-
paign. If your campaign is to promote the Hop-n-Pop Toaster, the toaster is
your target product. So let’s add your target products to this campaign:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Marketing button. At
the top of the pane, select Campaigns.
2. In the Campaigns window, double-click your campaign.
The campaign window appears.
3. In the navigation pane of the campaign window, click Target Products.
The workspace switches to the target products view, as shown in 
Figure 22-11.
Figure 22-11:

277
Chapter 22: Managing Campaigns

4. In the window’s toolbar, click Add Existing.
A Look Up Records dialog box appears.
5. Find and select your intended target product, and then double-click
the right-pointing arrow to move it to the right-hand pane.
6. Click OK.
Back in the target products workspace, you’ll see that your new product
has been added.
7. Click the Save and Close button to close the campaign window, or go
back to the navigation pane for more options.
Adding target products is useful, especially to your call makers, who might
not be that familiar with all the products in a campaign.
Sales Literature
Just like you linked a target product, you can also link sales literature for the
campaign or for that product. This way, your call makers can look at the
same thing the customer is looking at. Just follow these steps:
1. In the navigation pane of the open campaign window, click Sales
Literature.
The workspace switches to the sales literature view, as shown in 
Figure 22-12.
Figure 22-12:

2. In the window’s toolbar, click Add Existing.
A Look Up Records dialog box appears.
3. Find and select your sales literature, and then double-click the right-
pointing arrow to move it to the right-hand pane.
4. Click OK.
Back in the sales literature workspace, you’ll see that your new docu-
ment has been added.
5. Click the Save and Close button to close the campaign window or go
back to the navigation pane for more options.
Target Marketing Lists
Target marketing lists are just what they sound like: the lists of people to
whom you are directing this campaign. See Chapter 21 for information about
building marketing lists. In this section, we show you how to link those mar-
keting lists to your campaign. Here’s how:
1. In the navigation pane of the open campaign window, click Target
Marketing Lists.
The workspace switches to your target marketing lists workspace, as
shown in Figure 22-13.
Figure 22-13:
Adding the

279
Chapter 22: Managing Campaigns

2. In the window’s toolbar, click Add.
As with adding target products and sales literature, the Look Up Records
dialog box appears.
3. Search for and select your records, and then click the right-pointing
arrow to move them to the Selected Records pane.
4. Click OK.
Another dialog window pops up, asking whether you want to add the
marketing lists to the campaign activities as well as this campaign.
5. Make your selection in the dialog box, and then click OK.
You can select the box or click it again to unselect it.
6. Click Save (the disk icon).
You could click the Save and Close button instead. But because we have
a related item to show you in the next section, we suggest that you click
Save so you can stay in the open campaign window.
Your target marketing list now appears in the workspace. Regarding the cam-
paign activity question (Step 4), let’s look at your activity lists to see exactly
what changes were made:
1. In the navigation pane of the open campaign window, click Campaign
Activities.
The workspace view switches to your campaign activities.
2. Double-click a campaign activity to open it.
3. In the navigation pane of the open campaign activity window, click
Target Marketing List.
The list that you just linked appears here.
Related Campaigns
Now, say you’re running two campaigns: one to identify interest by product
category and one to reflect different marketing strategies for each product
category. That’s great. But what if you want to compare them? Easy! Just
relate the campaigns to each other. Here’s how:
1. In the navigation pane of the open campaign window, click Related
Campaigns.
The window switches to the related campaigns workspace, as shown in
Figure 22-14.
280
Part IV: Making the Most of Marketing 

2. In the window’s toolbar, click Add.
Like the other options mentioned in this chapter, the Look Up Records
dialog box appears.
3. Search for the other campaign you want to relate to this one, select it,
and click the right-pointing arrow to add it to the right-hand pane.
4. Click OK.
You return to the related campaigns workspace.
5. Click Save (the disk icon) or the Save and Close button to save your
work.
One of the great features of Microsoft CRM is that you can do a report on just
about anything, including campaign performance, which you can check by
clicking the Campaign Responses or Related Campaigns selection in the navi-
gation pane of your campaign window. Then just click the Reports icon in the
window’s toolbar (or select a report from the drop-down box by clicking the
arrow next to the Reports icon). The report can be printed as a table or a
graph. Either way, use the information to help you stay on top of what’s going
on in the campaign.

Part V
Taking Care of
Your Customers

In this part . . .
O
ne of the beautiful parts of Microsoft CRM is that it
handles both sales and service. This integration
enables your organization to coordinate activities from
both sides of the fence. Salespeople, in the middle of
trying to close a deal, won’t be blindsided by some raging
customer support issue. Customer service people will
know enough to provide that little extra when a major sale
is about to go down.
Customer service is one of the hot buttons in CRM and is
an area in which Microsoft CRM shines. When a customer
calls with an issue, it is logged as a case (Chapter 23). 
Scheduling service activities is a special case of more 
general activity scheduling and is discussed in Chapter 24.
Managing your database of subjects is handled in 
Chapter 25.
Cases and tasks are put into a queue for orderly disposi-
tion and management by staff members (Chapter 26). 
Microsoft CRM even includes contract administration, 
so everyone can see what type of support a customer 
is entitled to and the software can properly decrement
contracts and advise when renewals are in order 
(Chapter 27). We describe all this in Part V.

Chapter 23
Working with Cases
In This Chapter
 Touring the Cases window

 Resolving and reactivating cases
M
icrosoft CRM has taken customer service to the next generation by
devoting an entire module of the program to it. The heart of the
Service module is the Cases window, where you can view, resolve, and reacti-
vate cases in an easy and comprehensible manner.
When a customer calls in with a problem, the customer service representative
taking the call opens a case to document the problem and its eventual solu-
tion. The customer may have a faulty power supply, a new version of software
that continually locks up, or a toaster that refuses to pop its contents. Some
companies refer to cases as tickets or issues. Whatever they’re called, active
case management is the name of the game; the better you manage your cases,
the better your customer service and customer satisfaction.
In this chapter, we show you how to create a case and assign it to someone
on your team. You find out how to open an existing case and resolve it,
scheduling activities related to gaining the solution along the way. You also
find out how to reactivate a case when necessary.
Case Management Overview
The case management path looks like this: A customer service representative
(CSR) takes a call. Let’s say the customer is having a problem with one of
your transporters. He dialed Camelot, A.D. 495 and ended up in Peoria, 1958.
The CSR creates a case and links it to the appropriate customer. The case is
assigned to an engineer. The engineer sets about finding a solution, generat-
ing a few e-mails to the customer along the way. The engineer solves the
problem and closes the case.

A week later, the customer calls back with the same problem. A CSR (not nec-
essarily the same one as before) reactivates the case, and the solution
process begins anew. A more thorough solution is developed and recorded,
and the case is closed again. A month later, a different customer calls with
the same problem. Any CSR can search the database for all cases related to
the same problem. This is case management at its best.
Working in the Cases Window
Cases are listed in the main display area of the Cases window, like the one
shown in Figure 23-1. You use this window to open cases, and then add notes
and schedule activities, with the goal of resolving the case. The Cases
window is also where you assign cases to other service representatives,
share cases, or accept them yourself. The entire service team can use this
window to collectively track the current status and ultimate disposition of
cases.
To open the Cases window, click the Service button at the bottom of the navi-
gation pane. Then select Cases from the list of options at the top of the pane.
Filter cases
Find cases
Sort cases by column headings
Figure 23-1:
The Cases
window is
where you
can view
and sort
cases.
286
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

The main part of the window has a list of all your active cases. You can filter
this list by choosing one of the following options from the drop-down menu
next to View.
 Active Cases: All cases assigned to you or your fellow team members
that haven’t been resolved.
 All Cases: All cases assigned to you or your fellow team members that
are open or have been resolved.
 My Active Cases: All cases assigned to you that haven’t been resolved.
During a Microsoft CRM session, when entering the Cases window for
the first time or going back to it, the View option always reverts to My
Active Cases (unless it has been changed by the system administrator).
 My Resolved Cases: All cases assigned to you that have been resolved.
 Resolved Cases: All cases assigned to you or your fellow team members
that have been resolved.
These are the views you get “out of the box.” Your implementation partner or
system administrator can add, rename, and delete views.
You can sort cases also by column headings. Just click a column heading to
sort as follows: 
 Title displays cases alphabetically.
 Status displays the cases alphabetically by status (resolved or active).
 Case Number displays cases in numerical order.
 Priority displays cases by level of importance.
 Created On displays cases in chronological order.
Again, note that your system administrator can add columns to this list or
delete columns from this list.
Click a column header a second time to display the cases in reverse order.
You have two ways to find specific cases. The Look For field at the top of the
Cases window lets you search active cases by title or case number. You may
type the full title or any part of it. Click the Find button, and a list of matching
cases appears. Use the wildcard character * to account for text that may or
may not exist. For example, searching for *porter would return Porter,
Transporter, and Exporter.
287
Chapter 23: Working with Cases

You can also use the Advanced Find feature to search various fields. To do so,
choose Tools➪Advanced Find or click the Advanced Find button in the tool-
bar at the top of the screen. Microsoft CRM lets you define search criteria
over several fields. Figure 23-2 shows just some of the case-related field that
you can use to perform a search.
Creating Cases
Typically, a Microsoft CRM user with administrative rights creates a customer
service team by assigning customer service representative (CSR) roles to
users in your company. Then the CSRs can use the Microsoft CRM Service
module to create, assign, and resolve cases. To create a case (assuming one
of your defined roles is CSR), first you need to get to the Case: New window,
as follows:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Service button. At the
top of the pane, select Cases.
The Cases window appears on the right (refer to Figure 23-1).
2. In the toolbar near the top of the screen, click New Record and then
select Case from the drop-down menu.
The Case: New window appears, as shown in Figure 23-3.
Figure 23-2:

288
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

Filling in the General tab
The Case: New window has two tabs: the General tab and the Notes and
Article tab. The General tab is divided into three sections: Overview, which
has six fields to further define the case; Assignment Information; and
Contract and Product Information.
Some fields (such as Subject) have a magnifying glass to the right of the field.
This means you must use the magnifying glass or the Form Assistant to fill in
the field. For more information on both options, see Chapter 2.
Remember, all fields in red are required. We’ll begin with the Overview area of
the General tab:
1. In the Title box of the General tab, enter a title for the case.
The title should be short yet informative. For example, you could name
the case after the faulty product and its part number (such as Hop-n-Pop
Toaster; Part #T86258) or the problem (such as Hopless Toaster). The
Title field can hold a maximum of 175 characters.
The text in this field can be used to search for the case later, so be spe-
cific and descriptive.
Figure 23-3:
The General
tab shows
basic
information
about the
case.
289
Chapter 23: Working with Cases

2. Use the Form Assistant to fill in the Customer field.
You could use the magnifying glass instead, but we’ll use the Form
Assistant here as an example of how it works:
a. Click the drop-down arrow by the Look For field and select
Account or Contact.
b. If you want, select an account (or contact) from the list, or use
the Find field to further narrow your search.
Remember to use the * wildcard character to help fill in the blanks
if you’re not sure of the full name of the record you’re looking for. If
you leave the Find field blank, a list of all accounts or contacts will
be displayed.
c. Click Find.
d. Select the account or contact from the list.
The account is entered into the Customer field.
3. Use the Form Assistant to fill in the Subject field.
The Subject option categorizes your cases by subject, such as Billing or
Product support. You can link the case to a subject in your subject tree.
(For more on the subject tree, see Chapter 25.)
4. Back in the General tab, in the Case Origin field, click the arrow and
select how you received the case.
5. In the Case Type box, select a value from the drop-down list.
The value categorizes the case as a question, problem, or request.
6. In the Satisfaction field, select the option that best indicates the cus-
tomer’s level of satisfaction with your service.
Maybe the Rolling Stones can’t get no satisfaction, but your 
customers can.
The Assignment Information area of the General tab has four fields. Fill them
in as follows:
1. In the Form Assistant, select the Owner option and choose who you
want to assign the case to for resolution.
This field defaults to you, the creator of the case. You can reassign the
case to another user later.
2. In the Follow Up By box, select the date on which the owner should
follow up on the case.
You can click the calendar or make a selection from the drop-down list.
3. In the General tab’s Status Reason field, select the option that best
describes the current status of the case.
4. In the Priority box, set a priority for this case.

Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

The Contract and Product Information area offers five more fields to define
your case:
1. In the Form Assistant, select the Contract option.
Select a contract to link this case to.
2. In the Form Assistant, select the Contract Line option.
Set the case to a contract line here.
3. In the General tab’s Service Level field, click the arrow and select the
appropriate service level from the list.
4. In the Form Assistant, select the Product option.
This lets you link the case to a particular product.
5. In the General tab’s Serial Number field, enter a serial number associ-
ated with this case or with a product associated with this case.
Now you can move on to the Notes and Article tab.
Filling in the Notes and Article tab
The other tab of the Case: New window, Notes and Article, is much simpler
than the General tab, as you can see in Figure 23-4. This is where you can
enter any notes and articles pertaining to the case. For example, you could
note your conversation with the customer in the Notes section and attach a
letter from the customer in the Article field.
Microsoft CRM calls a knowledge base item an article. So you could have, for
example, an item, or article, on how to stop a transporter from going to
Peoria. 
To fill in the first area of the Notes and Article tab, follow the self-explanatory
instruction to “Click here to enter a new note.” A data entry area appears for
you to manually enter a note. Enter as many notes as you like.
In the second area, you can link an article that ties into this particular case. If
you use the Form Assistant and select the Article option, Microsoft CRM
automatically displays your top ten article selections based on the links you
defined in the knowledge base. (For more information on the knowledge base,
see Chapter 9.) If this list doesn’t show you the article you need, you can use
the magnifying glass.
Click the Show Article check box to display the article you selected in the
Notes and Article tab. After the article is displayed, you can e-mail it to a
client from this tab by clicking Email KB Article.

Chapter 23: Working with Cases

In the last section, we showed you how to use the Form Assistant. Here, we’ll
describe the second technique, using the magnifying glass. To look up a knowl-
edge base article in your library and attach it to this case, do the following:
1. Click the magnifying glass icon at the end of the Article field.
The Look Up Articles dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 23-5. You
have a handful of ways for searching the knowledge base.
2. Click the arrow in the top drop-down box to choose one of the follow-
ing options to search for articles:
• Full text search: Search the full text of articles for specific words
• Keyword search: Search by keyword
• Title search: Search by article title
• Article number search: Search for an article number
• Subject browse: Browse all the subjects to find what you want
3. In the Search For field, enter the word or words that you want to find.
4. In the In Subject field, make a selection:
a. Click the magnifying glass to the right of the field.
The Look Up a Subject dialog box appears, listing your subjects
organized by headings and subheadings. You can choose a specific
subject for the program to search. For example, if you select the
subject Marketing, the program won’t look for your text in Sales,
Service, or Thank You Letters.

b. Select a subject.
c. Click OK.
5. In the Options field, make a selection from the drop-down list.
You have two options: Exact Text, which means the search looks for
exact matches only, and Use Like Words, which searches for the string of
text you entered. For example, enter the word pro and you’ll get every-
thing containing that sequence of letters.
6. Click the Search button.
A list of articles meeting your search criteria appears on the right.
7. When you find the article you want, double-click it (or select it and
click OK) to attach it to the case.
You return to the Case: New dialog box, where you can continue adding
articles or exit the case altogether. Only one article can be attached at a
time.
8. To save your data, click the Save and Close button in the upper-left
corner of the Case: New window.
Congratulations, you’ve made your first case (and it has nothing to do with
baskets). The next step in working with a case is to assign it (if you’re the
assigner) or accept it (if you’re the assignee).

Chapter 23: Working with Cases

Assigning and Accepting Cases
After you create a case, you can begin to manage it. In a typical service
department, managers assign cases in a number of ways. The case might be
on a first-come, first-served basis or assigned by the level of complexity to
the person with the experience for that level. Maybe the service staff is seg-
mented by product lines, and cases are assigned based on the associated
product. From a different perspective, cases may be pushed out to techni-
cians by a manager or they may be pulled by the staff. In all these scenarios,
cases must be managed.
After work on a case begins, your service department should have a standard
operating procedure in place to determine how often a case should be
reviewed. If you use workflow rules (described in Chapter 8), you can auto-
mate the case review timeline. Whether the review process is automated or
manual, cases can be opened and edited as they are moved to resolution.
The first thing you want to do to start work on a case is to assign it to some-
one. In the following, we assign a case to a user:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Service button. At the
top of the pane, select Cases.
The Cases window appears on the right.
2. In the Cases window, select a case.
To select several records for an ensuing action, hold down the Ctrl key
and click. Checking the little box at the top of the first column (under
the New button) selects all cases.
3. Click the Assign icon in the toolbar above the list of cases.
The Assign to Queue or User dialog box appears, displaying two options
for managing cases. Route Case is a powerful option after you establish
workflow rules. Find out more about defining workflow rules and
processes in Chapter 8.
4. Click the “Assign to another user or queue” option, and then click the
magnifying glass icon to the right of the field.
The Look Up Records dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 23-6.
5. In the Look For box, choose User or Queue.
By default, the field displays User. In this example, we’re assigning the
case to a fellow user, so you’re all set. A brief explanation of queues
appears later in this section.
294
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

6. To narrow the search, go to the field to the left of the Find button and
type the last name of the user to whom you’d like to assign the case.
Then click Find.
A list of all matching users appears. When you enter a last name, you need
to enter only as many letters as it will take Microsoft CRM to select the
appropriate user from the list. The search will yield all possible matches.
(For example, if you type sm — the search is not case sensitive — you’ll
get Smith, Mary, and Smolinski, Gerald.)
7. Select the name of the user to whom you want to assign the case, and
click OK.
You must highlight the appropriate user even if only one match is listed.
When you click OK, you return to the Confirm Assignment dialog box,
where the username now appears.
8. Click OK to close the Confirm Assignment dialog box.
You return to the window of the case you were assigning, and that case
has now been assigned.
9. As with everything else in Microsoft CRM, remember to click Save or
Save and Close to ensure that your changes stick.
For you users to whom the case has been assigned, you can now view the
case in your Cases window.
Figure 23-6:
You can

295
Chapter 23: Working with Cases

Microsoft CRM uses queues as a way of sorting cases for action by a specific
group of customer service representatives. Think of a queue as an inbox for
similar cases. By creating a queue based on expertise with a certain line of
products or experience with a certain type of procedure, you can help
streamline the solution process by associating the right people with a spe-
cific type of problem or service request.
When you’re working in the Assign to Queue or User dialog box (refer to Step
3 in the preceding list), you can assign the case to a queue or route it based
on workflow rules (see Chapter 8). After you’ve accepted a case, it appears in
your My Active Cases view.
Follow these steps to check out and accept cases assigned to your queue:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Workplace button.
2. At the top of the navigation pane, in the My Work section, select
Queues.
If a plus sign appears next to My Work, click it first to open the list. The
Queues window appears on the right, with its own navigation pane and a
list of queues (refer to Figure 23-7).
3. In the Queues window, click a folder under My Work.
Each folder is a separate queue. All cases assigned to that queue appear
in the main window.
Figure 23-7:

296
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

In Microsoft CRM, you can’t reject a case or an activity. (By activity, I
mean a task, a fax, a phone call, an e-mail, a letter, or an appointment.) If
you don’t want to accept a case or an activity that has been assigned to
you, you must reassign it to another user or queue.
4. Click the case you want to accept.
To select multiple cases, hold down the Ctrl key and click.
5. At the top of the Queues window, click the Accept button.
The Confirm Assignment dialog box appears.
6. Click OK.
The case is now removed from the queue and assigned to you in your In
Progress queue.
Tending to Cases
As you work toward resolving a case, you typically have to perform certain
activities to obtain a solution. For example, you might need to perform tests
on the T-900 Transporter to see whether it will repeat the problem your cus-
tomer reported. In this scenario, you would perform the following steps to
log your time and associate it with the T-900 case:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Service button. Then,
and the top of the pane, select Cases.
The Cases window appears.
2. In the Cases window, double-click the case you’re working on.
To follow along with the example, we double-clicked the case for which
we are scheduling a test.
3. In the navigation pane, click the Activities option.
The window shows uncompleted activities associated with the case.
4. In the toolbar, click the New Activity button.
The New Activity dialog box appears. Because we’re performing a test
on the equipment, a task sounds like the right activity type.
5. Highlight Task, and then click OK.
The Task: New window appears.
6. Enter a subject that describes the task you’ll be performing.
297
Chapter 23: Working with Cases

Note that the Regarding field already displays the case title, and your
name should be in the Owner field. The Duration defaults to 30 minutes,
but this can be changed using the drop-down menu or on the main Task
window. If appropriate, you can also complete the Due date and time;
Priority; Category; and Subcategory fields.
7. Click the Save and Close icon.
The task now appears in the main display for the associated case.
To complete the task (and automatically accrue billable time against the
case), follow these steps:
1. In the Cases window, double-click the appropriate case.
The Case window appears, showing the case you selected. (The title of
the window includes the name of the case.)
2. In the navigation pane, click the Activities option.
You see a list of all activities associated with this case.
3. Double-click the task you want to close.
4. Click the Save as Completed icon.
In the Case window, you’ll see that the task is no longer displayed under
Activities in the navigation pane. But wait! Check History. If you had
spent one hour performing the task, for example, the customer would
now be on the hook for one hour of contract time.
Resolving a case
You can resolve cases in a number of ways. Maybe you know the solution and
can resolve a case as soon as you accept it. Or you may have to research
your knowledge base to see whether another service representative has
solved the problem. (Chapter 9 covers the knowledge base in depth.)
You can’t resolve a case until all activities associated with the case have been
completed. This might require completing phone calls, tasks, and appoint-
ments, sending e-mail messages, and more. This prevents a user from acci-
dentally closing a case before all mandated workflow and activities have been
completed.
After you determine a solution to a case, follow these steps to resolve it:
1. In the Cases window, double-click the case you want to resolve.
You may find it helpful to first select My Active Cases from the View
drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the window.
298
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

2. In the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Actions➪
Resolve Case.
The Resolve Case dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 23-8. Note that
Microsoft CRM automatically calculates and fills in the Total Time field.
Total time is defined as the sum of time spent on all activities associated
with the resolution of the case. CRM recognizes the following activities
as billable (that is, automatically tracked against a case): task, fax,
phone call, letter, e-mail, and appointment.
If you need to adjust the amount of time that the customer will be billed,
you may manually override the total time after the case has been
resolved.
3. In the Resolution Type field, make your selection from the drop-down
list.
4. In the Resolution field, type a short explanation of the resolution.
5. Choose a Billable Time increment from the drop-down menu.
If this activity is linked to a contract, the billable time you indicate here
is applied against the total time listed in the contract.
6. If you want, fill in the Description field.
7. Click OK.
The Resolve Case dialog box closes. Note that the case status updates to
Resolved in the lower-left corner of the Case window.

Chapter 23: Working with Cases

Reactivating a case
If a customer calls with a recurrence of a previously resolved problem, you
need to reactivate the case. Follow these steps:
1. In the Cases window, select My Resolved Cases or All Resolved Cases
from the View drop-down menu.
A list of all your resolved cases appears.
2. Double-click the case you want to reactivate.
3. In the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Actions➪Reactivate.
The Reactivate Confirmation dialog box appears.
4. Click OK.
The case status in the lower-left corner of the Case window appears as
active.
As you can see, Microsoft CRM offers extensive choices to help you better
serve your customers, with almost everything just a few clicks away.

I
magine that it’s 102 degrees and every air conditioner from here to the
county line has decided to call it quits. Your customers, Mrs. Reynolds, Mr.
Wayne, Mr. Cobb, and the rest are calling and starting to lose their cool. They
want their units fixed ASAP, and you can’t blame them.
Now, you and your guys can handle all these calls, you know you can. Besides,
you have Microsoft CRM’s robust service scheduling abilities (say that ten
times fast) in your corner of the ring. You can schedule all your repair people
with a few clicks. In this chapter, you find out how to get your resources and
users into the service schedule and then how to schedule them both.
What is a resource? It can be anything you need to help your customers 
with their service. So if you have, say, a special wrench or an expensive air-
conditioning computer to autodiagnose issues, you can assign these to your
users or technicians on a job by job or daily basis. That way, you can easily
prevent scheduling conflicts that might come up if you assigned the same
resource to different people.

Scheduling Resources 
into Microsoft CRM
With Microsoft CRM, you and your staff can easily deliver timely customer
service. The first thing you need to do is set up your resources — that is,
your facilities and equipment — on the schedule. Later in the chapter, you
define your services.
Let’s see how this works:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Settings button.
The Settings window appears on the right.
2. From the Settings window, select Business Unit Settings. Then select
Local Facilities/Equipment.
You can now begin adding your resources. From here, you can also view
your resources, local facilities and equipment, and subsidiary facilities
and equipment using the View drop-down list (see Figure 24-1).
3. In the window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Facilities/Equipment: New window appears, as shown in Figure 24-2.
Figure 24-1:
Resources

302
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

4. In the Name field, name your resource.
We recommend you use the common name for the item, so that every-
one in your company can find it. Naming the heavy-duty winch “Big
Cheese” won’t do any good if you’re the only one that calls it that. You
have up to 100 characters for the name of your resource. Remember that
all fields in bold (red on your computer screen) are required.
5. Next up, select a Business Unit.
See Chapter 6 for more information on business units. This field auto-
matically defaults to your company’s business unit, but you can change
it by clicking the magnifying glass.
6. Choose a site for your resource.
This optional field is useful if you have more than one location for your
resources. For example, you might want to indicate whether you want to
use the heavy-duty winch at your Newtown facility or the one at your
Portville location.
7. Enter an e-mail address.
You can use this field to send e-mails about this resource. For instance,
suppose you’re taking the heavy winch out and want to notify Steve, the
equipment manager. You can set up a business process so that every
time you schedule this resource, an e-mail to Steve is generated. (For
more on processes, see Chapter 7.)
Figure 24-2:
Start with
the name 
of your

303
Chapter 24: Scheduling Services

8. Choose a time zone.
The default time zone is the one for your company. However, you can
change it by making a selection from the drop-down list.
9. Last but not least, enter a description of the resource.
This field is optional.
10. Click the Save and Close button.
You return to the Facilities/Equipment window.
Now that you’ve entered your resource into Microsoft CRM, you should create
a schedule for it. The schedule tells everyone when the resource can be used.
For this scenario, we’ll use the Big Cheese (the winch). You just purchased it
on Saturday, and it’s ready for deployment in the field. However, you want
downtime scheduled for maintenance every Friday:
1. In the Facilities/Equipment window, select the resource you just cre-
ated by double-clicking it.
The window for this resource appears. Eyes up: Note that it has its own
navigation pane.
2. In the resource’s navigation pane, click Work Hours.
A tab called Monthly View appears with a monthly calendar, as shown in
Figure 24-3. To change months, click the arrow on either side of the
month at the top of the calendar.
Figure 24-3:

Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

3. Double-click a day where you want to either restrict work or start the
schedule for the resource.
4. Choose one of the following options and then click OK:
* This day only: Changes only the date you’ve selected.
• This date onward: Changes the schedule from this day onward.
• Entire recurring weekly schedule from start to end: Changes the
schedule for all dates, including past dates.
For our example, select the second option. The Weekly Schedule: Edit
screen appears, as shown in Figure 24-4.
5. Fill out this page.
Most of the fields in this screen are self-explanatory. You can change or
select your work hours by double-clicking the bold (blue on-screen)
hours listed after Work Hours. Uncheck any day that is not available for
scheduling (the default is for everything to be checked). Business clo-
sure dates are explained later in the chapter, but here you indicate
whether or not this resource is available during business closure dates.

Chapter 24: Scheduling Services

Setting Up a User’s Schedule
As we mentioned earlier, you can put users as well as resources into your ser-
vice schedule. Chapter 6 has more information on how to add a user to your
program. This section is strictly for setting up the schedule for a previously
created user so that when the person is scheduled for something, the time
scheduled is compared to that user’s working hours. Let’s take a look:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click Settings.
2. Click Business Unit Settings.
3. Click Users.
The Users window appears.
4. Double-click the user whose schedule you want to set.
5. In the navigation pane of this window, select Work Hours (under
Details).
6. In the window’s toolbar, click Set Up and then select Time Off.
You can set up a new weekly work schedule or schedule working hours for
a particular day. For this example, we selected Time Off to give our person
a break. Selecting Time Off displays the Schedule Time Off dialog box.
7. Fill in the fields, all of which are self-explanatory, and then click OK.
8. Click the Save and Close button to return to the Users window.
As always, save, Save, SAVE!
Creating a Resource Group
Let’s review: You have users and you have resources. A resource group is a
group of users or resources or both that can be scheduled for a service activ-
ity. For example, suppose Brenda and Steve, who both work on commercial
air conditioners, and the heavy-duty winch are inseparable as far as service
calls go. So instead of scheduling three separate things, we’ll group Brenda,
Steve, and the Big Cheese into a resource group.
To create a resource group, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click Settings.
2. In the screen on the right, select Business Units.
3. Select Resource Groups.
The Resource Groups window appears.
306
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

4. In the window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Resource Group: New window appears, as shown in Figure 24-5.
5. Fill in the following information:
a. Name: This is the name of the resource group. We’re calling ours
Air-1.
b. Business unit: As mentioned, the default unit is your main busi-
ness unit, but this can be changed by clicking the magnifying glass
and making a selection.
c. Description: This is optional but recommended.
6. Click Save.
Because we’re moving to another part of this window, we don’t want to
click Save and Close just yet.
7. In the Resource Group: New navigation pane, select Resources.
The Resources option is not live (active) until you click Save in Step 6.
Also, eyes up and note that the title of the window has now changed to
Resource Group: Air-1 (because the group we created is Air-1).
8. In the window’s toolbar, click Add Resources.
The Look Up Records dialog box appears.
Figure 24-5:
Create 
your new

307
Chapter 24: Scheduling Services

9. In the Look For field, make a selection.
You can look for Facility/Equipment, Resource Group, Team, or User. 
For our example, we want look in both User and Facility/Equipment.
10. If you want to add another resource, repeat Steps 8 and 9.
11. Click OK.
You are returned to the Resources window of your new resource group.
12. Remember to click Save and Close.
You can include resource groups as members of other resource groups. For
example, you could have a resource group called Engineers — Virginia that
consists of resource groups of technicians in each county.
Creating a Site
Sites are basically your service and sales locations, whether it’s in
Kathmandu or Hollywood. In Microsoft CRM, you can set up as many sites as
you want, therefore creating a more efficient and effective service and sched-
uling system. Resources and users can be assigned to sites as well.
To create a site, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Settings button.
2. In the window on the right, select Sites.
The Sites window appears, as shown in Figure 24-6.
3. In the window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Site: New window appears, with two tabs: General and Address.
Remember fields in bold (red on your screen) are required.
4. In the General tab, enter the name, which is required, and any other
information you can.
5. On the Address tab, enter the address and select a time zone for that
site.
The Time Zone default is the time zone of your primary location, but you
can change this.
6. Click Save (the disk icon).
We still have some things to do with the site before we can click the Save
and Close button.

Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

Now that you’ve created your site and saved it, you can add resources to it.
Follow these steps:
1. In the navigation pane of the Site: New window, select Resources.
Keep in mind that the Resources options in the navigation pane will not
be live until you click Save.
2. On the window’s toolbar, click the Add Resources button.
The Look Up Records dialog box appears.
3. In the Look Up Records dialog box, you can search for your selections
using the Look For list and the Find field.
You can search for User or Facility/Equipment. Make your selection,
enter the user or facility (or equipment) in the field to the left of the Find
button, and then click Find. Your results will appear in the Available
Records pane.
4. Double-click the desired record to move it to the Selected Records
pane.
You can also click the record once and then click the arrows to add or
remove items from the Selected Records pane.

6. If you want to add more resources, go back to Step 2.
7. When you’ve finished adding resources, click Save and Close.
The site window closes, and your site is saved.
Creating Services
Now that you’ve added users, sites, and resources, it’s time to add your ser-
vices. Don’t despair; you’re almost finished with your setup. To create a service:
1. In the navigation pane, click Settings.
2. In the window on the right, select Services.
The Services window appears.
3. In the window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Service: New window appears, as shown in Figure 24-7, with two tabs:

b. Initial Status Reason: This field lets you set the initial service
activity status when an activity is created. (In case you don’t speak
Microsoft CRMese, this means your company can establish an

e. Start Activities Every: Select how far apart you want to stagger the
activity. If your Toaster Tune-Up takes an hour, you can indicate
that you want the service to start every 1.5 hours, giving your
techs a 15-minute break.
f. Beginning At: Choose a time to start the services every day.
5. Click the Required Resources tab (see Figure 24-8).
You can’t define a service without assigning one required resource and
one selection rule. Note that the Required Resources tab has a Common
Tasks pane, where you can add, edit, or remove selection items or
resources. The right side of the screen shows all selection rules,
resources, and resource groups assigned to this service.

Scheduling Service Activities
Okay, pat yourself on the back and give your IT folks a bonus. You’ve added
all the pieces — users, sites, resources, and services — and can now start
scheduling. Because this is organized during system design and installation,
your users (that is, your sales staff) will not have to face doing this setup
every day. So, when Mrs. Reynolds calls to get her air conditioner fixed, your
staff can schedule her into their workload with just a few clicks.
As mentioned in Chapter 3, some aspects of Microsoft CRM are available only
in the Internet Explorer Client of Microsoft CRM. On the flip side, a few fea-
tures are only in the Outlook Client of Microsoft CRM. With that in mind,
remember that the Service Calendar is not found in the Outlook Client.
Let’s have a look at how you actually schedule a service in Microsoft CRM:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Service button. At the
top of the pane, select Service Calendar.
Your Service Calendar appears.
2. In the Type field (next to the Look For field), select Service Activity
from the drop-down list.
You see all service activities scheduled for today.
3. Choose a day for the service.
You can navigate to different dates using the calendar and navigation
tools in the window’s right pane. (The calendar pane is collapsible, so
you may need to open it to view the calendar.) You can choose the date
also by using the calendar selections at the bottom of the schedule
pane.
4. In the window’s toolbar, Click the New button and make your selection.
To follow along with the example, choose Service Activity. The Service
Activity: New window appears, as shown in Figure 24-9.
5. In the Subject field, enter a name for this service activity.
6. In the Service field, select the service you want to schedule.
To select the service, you can use the magnifying glass or the Form
Assistant.
7. The following fields are optional:
a. Site: If certain resources are available at only one site, you can
indicate that site here. That way, the service activity is assigned to
the appropriate site. Also, only resources linked to that site will be
available for this service.
313
Chapter 24: Scheduling Services

b. Customers: The customer (account or contact) for whom you’re
scheduling the service activity.
c. Resources: Choose your resources here. For example, if you need
the Big Cheese winch for this activity, you’d indicate that here. 
(Or you can leave this field empty and let the person in charge of
scheduling enter the resources.)
d. Location: Where the service activity is taking place. Using our air
conditioner service example, if the unit is located out behind the
chicken shed or on the rooftop, you would put that here.
e. Show Time As: Indicate whether the activity is Open or Scheduled.
You have the options Requested and Tentative under Open and
Pending, Reserved, In Progress, and Arrived under Schedule. If you
choose Scheduled or one its options, the time is marked on the cal-
endar and you can’t schedule other activities for that time.
8. Choose your start and end times as well as the duration.
Or if you want to mark the entire day on the calendar, you can select the
All Day Event check box.
9. Add any notes.
Figure 24-9:

10. Click the Details tab and fill it in as required.
Here, you can assign ownership and a priority to the activity as well as
link this activity to another account or contact (or more). You can also
assign a category and even a subcategory to the activity under this tab.
11. Click the Save and Close button to schedule the activity.
You return to the Service Calendar window, where your newly scheduled
activity appears.
You can also schedule appointments in this calendar.
For those of you who want to check your resources and users from the main
working area of Microsoft CRM, you can go to the Service Calendar. Just
follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Service button.
2. At the top of the pane, select Service Calendar.
3. Click any resource, and you will see the schedule for that resource in
the calendar area.
The screen is split into a resources area and a calendar area, as shown in
Figure 24-10. It looks a little busy but we wanted to show you just how many
options are available.
Figure 24-10:

Chapter 24: Scheduling Services

You can customize the screen by shrinking the resources pane or the calen-
dar pane (just click the line separating the two and drag it). You can also col-
lapse the bottom part, showing the resource information, by clicking the
black triangle under the word Zoom. The graphical calendar on the right can
be collapsed by clicking the arrow in the little calendar to the left of the word
Calendar. The Zoom feature allows you to choose the increments the calen-
dar is shown in, from 1-day to 15-minute increments.
The Service Activity Volume Report
Want to know what kinds of cases your staff handled, how long the work
took, and what was accomplished? Then the Service Activity Volume report
is for you.
You can reorganize the report seven ways from Sunday and filter it to pare
down the data. The default grouping is by number of service activities by
month, sorted by month, week, or date in ascending order. You can analyze
your service activities from a number of viewpoints so that you can better
manage your service department and maintain peak efficiency and respon-
siveness. You can see either the duration or number of service activities,
grouped by services, resources, time periods, or other groupings.
Now that you know how to schedule — and your business has been running
smoothly as people are processed in and out of the customer database —
let’s look at putting all that information together into a readable format.
Here’s how:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane click the Workplace button. At
the top of the pane, select Reports (under My Work).
The Reports window appears, as shown in Figure 24-11.
2. In the Look For field, type Service Activity and then click the Find
button.
The Service Activity Volume report appears.
3. Double-click the report to open it.
Another, less direct way to find this report is to select Service Reports in
the Category list and then select it from the options presented.
4. In the Service Activity Volume window, enter how many days’ worth
of service activities you want to see.
On your screen, the number is underlined. But as soon as you move
your cursor over it, you’ll get a free-form entry field. For our example,
we’re going to use 30 days, as shown in Figure 24-12.

5. If you need to change the selection criteria for the report, click Edit
Filter in the top-right corner and make the necessary changes.
You return to the screen shown in Figure 24-12 so you can make your
changes. The filter is initially set to select the number of days. You can
change the criteria or add additional criteria. You can also clear the
selection criteria from this page.
6. Click Run Report in the lower-right corner.
After a few seconds, you get a comprehensive report that you can orga-
nize in many ways. You can choose a display method (Activity Count or
Activity Duration). You can also group your information using the options
in the drop-down box under Group By and choose at what size you want
to view the report. Figure 24-13 shows the report. You can also export or
print from this page. If you change the criteria using the options on this
page, just click View Report to view your refreshed information.
Now that you’ve found out how to set up your services and how to schedule
and run reports, you are well on your way to not only more efficient servicing
processes but also happier customers (and a happier bank account).

Managing Your Subjects
In This Chapter
 Adding subjects

 Relating subjects to other activities
W
hen managing your subjects (no, not the evil-overlord-type subjects),
you can organize all your cases, sales materials, knowledge base arti-
cles, and products — creating a hierarchical tree of information that we call a
subject tree. At the trunk of the subject tree are your main topics. The tree
has branches, which also have branches, which can also have branches. With
Microsoft CRM, the subject groups get narrower until you’re down to that
last, specific article — or, using our tree example, you’re down to that last
spindly twig.
Suppose you have a hospital supply company. The trunk of the subject tree
contains your main topics, such as the hospital supplies you manufacture
and sell. You might add subjects (big branches) representing your products
and services, such as surgical supplies, dressings, drugs, prosthetics, clean-
ing supplies, and beds. For the subject Surgical Supplies, you might add the
different types of surgical supplies that you sell, such as gloves, pumps, and
sutures (more branches off that main one).
Want another level of detail? Under the subject Gloves, add the different
types of gloves you sell. Under Sutures, add the different brands or different
thicknesses.
Also remember that Microsoft CRM subjects can be not only products but
also services. For this chapter, we’ll use Bikes, Clothing and Accessories, and
Company Information as our subjects.
Structuring your subjects and their relationship to one another is important.
We’ll show you how to create your subjects and add items or more subjects
to them in this chapter.

Tips for Defining Your Subjects
Microsoft CRM uses a collapsible tree system much like the one that
Windows and Microsoft Outlook use. Creating a subject tree offers the follow-
ing benefits:
 A consistent hierarchy for associating contacts with products, sales lit-
erature, and knowledge base information
 Easy access to information related to specific subjects
 Centralized management of subjects (including creating, editing, and
removing subjects) and their relationship to one another in the subject
tree
Building a subject tree is easy, but figuring out what to put on which branch
can be difficult. We recommend scheduling a brainstorming session with dif-
ferent departments in your company. Define your products and services into
categories and topics. If those categories and topics can be further divided
(such as surgical supplies to gloves to different sizes of gloves), create your
subtopics.
Brainstorming can become perplexing and lead to lengthy discussions. Don’t
worry — spending time on the subject tree at the beginning is far better than
building the subject tree on the fly. And moving things around in the subject
tree later isn’t as easy as placing them at their appropriate level in the first
place. Additionally, ad hoc subject design may not account for the needs of
your entire organization. You can save yourself time and aggravation by
having a blueprint in place first.
No hard-and-fast rules exist when defining the structure of a subject tree.
Each company has its own priorities. But you might want to consider the fol-
lowing items when defining your subject tree structure:
 Price lists
 Sales literature
 Product specs
 Warranty information
 Service contracts
 Knowledge base articles
Only users with the appropriate access rights can create subjects and add
items to a subject tree. (See Chapter 6 for more information.)
320
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

You can also relate items such as product catalogs and sales literature to 
subjects.
Accessing the Subjects Window
After you have created the outline or blueprint for your company’s subject
tree, be sure to save it where it can be easily accessed when you’re ready to
build it. A good idea is to have the administrative assistant (who as we all
know, truly runs the company) create the outline in a Word document.
In the Subjects window, you can add subjects, edit them, and remove them.
We perform all those tasks in this chapter. First, however, you need to get to
that window. Just follow these steps:
1. At the bottom part of the navigation pane, click the Settings button.
The Settings window appears on the right.
2. In the Settings window, click Subjects.
The Subjects window appears, as shown in Figure 25-1.
Figure 25-1:
Begin
managing
your
subjects
here.
321
Chapter 25: Managing Your Subjects

Three options appear in the Common Tasks pane, which is to the left of the
main display: Add a Subject, Edit Selected Subject, and Remove Selected
Subject. We cover each of these in the following sections.
Adding a Subject
Now that you’ve followed the bread crumbs to the Tree of Microsoft CRM,
you can start adding your subjects. We suggest adding the subjects you’ve
designated as the trunk of your subject tree, in other words, the main cate-
gories or topics. Modifying and updating the subject tree is part of the evolu-
tionary process of any business.
To add subjects, follow these steps:
1. In the Common Tasks area of the Subjects window, click Add a
Subject.
The Add Subject dialog box appears.
2. Enter a title for the subject and (if desired) a description.
3. To place the new subject under a previously created subject, click the
magnifying glass icon next to the Parent Subject field.
The Subject Lookup dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 25-2.
If you navigate to the selected parent and child before you click Add a
Subject, the Parent Subject field is automatically populated with your
highlighted selection.
Figure 25-2:
You can
associate
the new
subject to a
parent
subject.
322
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

4. Click the appropriate plus sign (+) to the left of a subject to open the
subject tree, highlight the subject you want as the parent, and click OK.
The new subject is added to the subject tree. This design flexibility
enables you to create a sophisticated hierarchy to match the blueprint
you came up with at the brainstorming session.
The desired parent could be the child of another subject.
5. If you selected a parent subject and you want to display the subject
you just added, you must click the plus sign to the left of the parent.
If the new subject was added as the child of a child, continue clicking
plus signs until you’ve drilled down to the appropriate level.
Clicking the plus sign to the left of a subject displays its children (if any exist)
and is the easiest way to drill down into a subject. If the plus sign turns into a
dot, you know that you’re at the end of the line for that subject.
Note: Whenever you make an addition or revision to the subject tree,
Microsoft CRM has an annoying habit of refreshing the entire window. If you
had drilled down several levels to add a new subject and clicked OK, the
screen refresh will take you all the way back to the top-level view of the sub-
ject tree (arrgh!). It does this so you will always have an up-to-date view of
your subject tree, but be prepared to spend a few extra mouse clicks when
adding lots of subjects.
Editing a Subject
The Edit Selected Subject option is the second option in the Common Tasks
pane (refer to Figure 25-1). This option enables you to rename a subject or
move it to another location in the subject tree.
To edit a subject, follow these steps:
1. In the Subject Tree area of the Subjects window, highlight the subject.
2. In the Common Tasks pane, click Edit Selected Subject.
The Edit Subject dialog box appears.
3. Edit the subject’s title, change the subject’s parent/child relationship
in the subject tree, or revise the description notes, all by entering text
into the respective fields.
To change the parent subject, you must use the magnifying glass at the
end of the field. The title and description can be modified by entering text.
323
Chapter 25: Managing Your Subjects

Moving a subject to a new parent subject will move all the selected sub-
ject’s associated children. This action could lead to an unpleasant sur-
prise for your co-workers the next time they look for a subject.
4. Click OK.
The Edit Subject dialog box closes, and your edits are saved.
Removing a Subject
The Remove Selected Subject option, the last option in the Common Tasks
pane, enables you to delete a subject from the subject tree. You might choose
this option if a product line has been discontinued or a service can no longer
be offered.
To remove a subject, follow these steps:
1. In the Subject Tree area of the Subjects window, highlight the subject
you want to remove.
2. In the Common Tasks pane, click Remove Selected Subject.
3. When a window appears asking whether you’re sure you want to
delete the subject, click OK.
The window closes and the subject tree refreshes, minus the subject you
removed.
Removing a subject could have serious consequences to product catalogs or
knowledge base entries. If you remove a subject such as Video Card listed
under the parent Hardware, and the card had several knowledge base articles
linked to it, the links will be broken and the related knowledge will be useless
if a future issue regarding the video card occurs.
One nice safety feature here is that you get an error message if the subject
you’re attempting to delete is associated with a case, a product, or a knowl-
edge base article or has any other object associated with it. Thanks, Microsoft!
Relating Subjects to Other Activities
Another great option that Microsoft CRM offers is the ability to link, or relate,
your subjects to activities (tasks, cases, and so on). In this way, you can find
subjects with fewer clicks.
For example, let’s assume that Sally in the service department opens a new
case pertaining to a software problem that Mr. Wayne is having with the Series
211 Transporter. Something about this case strikes her as familiar. Because
324
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

other cases were associated to the subject “Series 211 Transporter,” Sally can
search for those cases and get a list of them almost instantly. Barry, her cube
neighbor, gets a request for sales literature on the Series 411 Transporter. He
conducts a search for all sales literature linked to the subject “Series 411
Transporter” and gets a list of all related documents. Last but not least,
there’s Jim, in the cube across the way. At a potential customer’s request, he
is researching the electrical requirements of all backup power supplies that
your company sells. He performs a knowledge base search of all articles
related to the subject called “Power Supplies” and prints those articles.
By associating and organizing subject trees with logical, explanatory details,
you can easily retrieve your company’s data and information.
Relating subjects to cases
Let’s go back to Sally and the case she just opened with Mr. Wayne. She wants
to make sure this case is linked to the “Series 211 Transporter” subject.
Others might come across the same problem and she knows that this is
important information for any of the CSRs in her company.
You can link new or existing cases to subjects by following these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Workplace button. At
the top of the pane, click Cases (under Service).
2. To start a new case, click the New button. Or to open an active case,
double-click it.
Both options display the Case window.
3. In the Case window, click the magnifying glass icon to the right of the
Subject field.
The Subject Lookup window displays the subject tree. Although you
may have only one subject tree for your company, you can design the
subject tree with as much complexity as you need.
4. Locate the subject to which you want to link the case.
You may need to click a plus sign or two to drill down to the appropriate
subject.
5. After you’ve located the subject you want, double-click it.
The subject you selected is displayed in the subject field of the Case
window.
6. Click the Save and Close icon in the upper-left corner of the window.
Your case is now related to the subject you selected.
325
Chapter 25: Managing Your Subjects

We recommend that cases be related to subjects when you first create the
case. However, if you’re not sure of the best subject to link to, you can assign
or change the subject later. Keep in mind that changing a subject related to a
case may cause problems if the case has been worked on and information
has been related to the previous subject.
Putting the case link to work
Suppose a customer calls with a problem with one of your company’s 
products — the Hop-n-Pop toaster just won’t hop when it pops the bread out.
Your customer service representatives can check to see whether any other
cases are linked to the same product using the Advanced Find feature. This
offers you the ability to conduct detailed searches in almost any searchable
field in Microsoft CRM.
To view all cases linked to a specific subject, follow these steps:
1. In the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Tools➪
Advanced Find.
The Advanced Find dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 25-3. The
Look For field tells the program where to look for the parameters you’re
going to add later. The Use Saved View lists searches you’ve saved previ-
ously. The area below these fields is where you’ll enter the data you
want to search for.
2. In the Look For field, click the arrow to the right and choose Cases.
Figure 25-3:
You can
search for
records
based on
values you
define.
326
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

3. Place your cursor over the blue Select option to activate the drop-
down menu, and then click the arrow to open the menu.
These options depend on what you chose in the Look For field in Step 2.
For example, if you chose to search for Documents, your search options
are File Size, Author Name, File Name, and so on. If you chose Facilities/
Equipment, you can search for Name, Primary E-mail, Business Unit, and
so on.
4. Place your cursor over the word Equals and set the Condition for the
search from the drop-down menu.
Again, placing your cursor over the word Equals activates the drop-down
menu. Click it to open the menu and make your selection.
5. Under Enter Value, select or enter the appropriate value.
This field is dependent on the decision made in the first column and will
not appear until you’ve made a selection from Step 3. For example, if you
chose Product in Step 3, the Value field will have a magnifying glass so
you can pull up the Look Up Records dialog box to select a product. If
you chose Case Number, you get a blank field in which you can simply
enter the case number.
6. Click the Find button (in the lower left).
A new window appears with your search results, created from the
choices you made in the main Advanced Find window.
7. To open an entry in the search results list, double-click it.
For more on Advanced Find, see Chapter 2.
Relating a subject to a knowledge base
article
The process of linking a subject to a knowledge base article is the same as
that for linking subjects to cases. (We discuss the knowledge base in detail in
Chapter 9.) A knowledge base article is a record (stored in the knowledge
base) that contains information. It may document a process, contain the his-
tory of the company, provide details on the company’s health or retirement
plan, or list employee addresses and phone numbers.
You can create a link between a knowledge base article and a subject when
you create the article. You can also link existing articles to existing subjects.
Linking knowledge base articles to specific subjects provides your customer
service representatives with a quick and easy way to search for similar prob-
lems and solutions in a specific subject.
327
Chapter 25: Managing Your Subjects

To link a new article to a subject, follow these steps:
1. On the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose New➪Article.
The Select a Template dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 25-4.
2. Select the appropriate template.
Templates help format your articles so that they’re uniform in appear-
ance, making them easier to read (this is handy when you have a client
on the phone). Microsoft CRM has several predefined templates, and
you can also create your own. (For more on templates, see Chapter 12.)
After you select a template, check the right side of the Select a Template
window. You’ll find basic information about the template you selected.
3. Click OK.
The Article: New window appears, as shown in Figure 25-5. (You find out
about creating and submitting articles in Chapter 9.)
4. Enter a Title for your new article.
5. Select the subject to which you want to link your article.
To do so, click the magnifying glass icon to the right of the Subject field.
In the Subject Lookup window that appears, select the subject from the
subject tree. You may need to click a plus sign or two to drill down to
the appropriate subject.
6. Place your cursor over the text that appears under Question and 
click it.
The predefined text is removed, and a free-form field appears so you can
enter your Article question.
Text can be edited and pasted into these positions just like in a
Microsoft Word document.
Figure 25-4:
The first
step to

328
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

7. Place your cursor over the text that appears under Answer and click.
Just like in Step 5, the predefined text is removed, and a free-form field
appears so you can enter your answer.
8. In the Additional Comments area, enter any text, if desired.
9. Click the Save and Close icon.
Your article is now related to the subject you selected.
To link a previously created knowledge base article to a subject, follow these
steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Service button. At the
top of the pane, select Knowledge Base.
The Knowledge Base window appears.
2. Under Article Queues, select Draft, Unapproved, or Published.
All draft or unapproved articles are displayed in the main window. Draft
articles have been composed but haven’t been submitted for approval
by a user with editors’ rights; consider them works in progress.
Unapproved articles have been submitted to a user who has been
assigned the task of reviewing and approving articles. Published articles
have been approved for the general population. After an article is pub-
lished, the Subject link can’t be altered. However, if you find you need to
change a published article, you can unpublish the article to make the
necessary changes.
Figure 25-5:
From here,

329
Chapter 25: Managing Your Subjects

3. Click the desired article.
The Article window appears.
4. Select the subject to which you want to link your article.
To do so, click the magnifying glass icon to the right of the Subject field.
In the Subject Lookup window that appears, select the subject from the
subject tree. You may need to click a plus sign or two to drill down to
the appropriate subject.
5. Click the Save and Close icon.
The article is now linked to the subject you selected.
Putting the article link to work
Let’s say that another customer calls about the Hop-n-Pop toaster. She heard
that an attachment is available that allows the user to toast hamburger buns.
You can search the knowledge base for the article that talks specifically
about the bun toaster option.
To view knowledge base articles linked to a specific subject, choose Go To➪
Workplace➪Knowledge Base. The Workplace: Knowledge Base window
appears. See Chapter 28 for more detailed searching techniques that you can
use to locate articles.
Relating a subject to the product catalog
As with cases and articles, products listed in the product catalog can also be
linked to a subject. This is an efficient way to set up metrics for tracking sales
by department, product type, subproduct type, and so on. The Subject field
related to a product catalog item may be edited at any time, as long as the
product remains active (see Chapter 18).
To link a product to a subject, follow these steps:
1. In the lower part of the navigation pane, click the Settings button.
2. In the upper part of the navigation pane, select Settings.
The Settings window appears on the right.
3. In the Settings window, select Product Catalog.
The Product Catalog window appears. Detailed information on using the
Product Catalog is in Chapter 18.
4. Select Products.
The Products window appears, as shown in Figure 25-6.
330
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

5. In the window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Product: New window appears. Chapter 18 contains detailed infor-
mation about this window. For now, direct your attention to the Subject
field.
6. Select the subject you want to link your product to.
To do so, click the magnifying glass icon to the right of the Subject field.
In the Subject Lookup window that appears, select the subject from the
subject tree.
7. Click the Save and Close icon.
Your product is now related to the subject you selected.
Searching for products linked to a subject requires using the Advanced Find
feature, which was described earlier in this chapter in “Putting the case link
to work.”
Relating a subject to sales literature
You follow the same steps to link a piece of sales literature to a subject as
you do to link cases and articles to a subject. What’s the advantage? Here’s
an example: Suppose you have a training manual that you sell. Your market-
ing department has created a two-page advertisement for the manual in PDF
format. It would be handy to be able to link the ad with the product using a
subject relation.
Figure 25-6:
This
window lists
all your
company’s
products.

Chapter 25: Managing Your Subjects

When customers call to request training information related to a specific
product, you can easily search for all the training materials associated with
the product, including the spiffy ad slick. You can then e-mail those docu-
ments to your customers, and within minutes they can be perusing the infor-
mation and deciding about training.
To link sales literature to a subject, follow these steps:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Sales button. At the top
of the pane, select Sales Literature.
The Sales Literature window appears.
2. In the Sales Literature window’s toolbar, click the New button or
double-click an existing sales literature item.
If you click New, the Sales Literature: New window appears. Otherwise,
you see the window for the existing literature item. Chapter 20 contains
detailed information about this window.
3. Select the subject you want to link your sales literature to.
To do so, click the magnifying glass to the right of the Subject field. In
the Subject Lookup window that appears, select the subject from the
subject tree.
4. Click the Save and Close icon.
Your sales literature is now related to the subject you selected.
Note that subjects related to sales literature can be edited at any time.
Searching for sales literature linked to a subject requires using the Advanced
Find feature, which is described earlier in “Putting the case link to work.”

Managing Queues

 Defining types of queues
 Creating queues
 Assigning activities to a queue
 Accepting activities from a queue
T
hink of a queue as a shared inbox in which related activities and similar
cases can be held for processing. Call it the list du jour. Activities are your
tasks, appointments, calls, and e-mails (see Chapter 14 for more about creat-
ing and managing activities). Cases are your service support tickets (see
Chapter 23 for more about working with cases). Processing means assigning
and accepting activities and cases (read on). A queue is handy not only
because it gives you a centralized list of outstanding activities and cases, but
also because you can sort your tasks by their subject matter or assignment.
Queues give access to issues and cases for all departments and areas of your
company without having to create a new ticket or incident for each depart-
ment. Say you have an issue with the Hop-n-Pop Toaster that initially comes
into your Customer Service queue, but when your customer service repre-
sentative (CSR) gets ahold of it, they find that it’s more a service issue. After
Service gets it, they figure the CSR must have been asleep because it’s a
billing issue. Instead of having three separate incidents running around your
system (remember the Minions of Chaos), you can easily take that activity
and switch it between queues.
Likewise, storage in a single queue makes it easy for customer service repre-
sentatives to locate an issue they’re qualified to address. Queues also enable
service managers to direct activities and cases to experts for a solution or to
other team members if a particular CSR is too busy.
The concepts of pull (in the case of your CSR) and push (in the case of your
service manager) can be automated by using workflow rules (see Chapter 8
for more about workflow rules) to make queues a powerful service manage-
ment assignment tool. In this chapter, we discuss the various queues defined
by Microsoft CRM and how to use them. You also discover how to create,
modify, and manage your own queues.

Queue Overview
Your company probably has a person who acts as a human router, directing
service calls and e-mails to the appropriate CSRs or taking care of an esca-
lated situation when the CSR cannot handle it. This person is usually the har-
ried-looking individual with the perma-cup of coffee in one hand. You may
call these people customer service managers, quality attention retainers, or
what have you, but for this book, we call them service managers. They are
the optimal choice for creating and defining your queues because they
manage the front lines of your customer service department. Your service
managers also know the strengths and weaknesses of your CSRs and can
assign them the proper queues; in this way, your best washing machine guy
isn’t dealing with refrigerator issues.
When you assign your CSRs to queues and then assign activities and cases to
those queues, you’re giving your people (and your company) an effective and
efficient means of solving problems and making customers happy.
A good, basic setup for queues is to create queues for each product or ser-
vice your company offers. For example, if you sell four brands of toasters,
you should create a queue for each brand of toaster. Maybe you run a clean-
ing service that cleans both personal homes and businesses. You could
create a domestic and a corporate queue. Another way to set up queues if
you sell or support only a single line is for the other area in your business to
interact with support. You could also create a queue for engineering, billing,
and shipping departments. Then if you need them involved in a case, you
could schedule an activity or the entire case to them.
Personal and Public Queues
Microsoft CRM comes with two predefined queue areas: the My Work queue,
listing folders for the activities and cases assigned to you, and the public
queue. The public queue area displays all the queues that your user ID belongs
to. Users who have been assigned the appropriate rights can create queues.
When you look into a public queue, you see all activities and cases associ-
ated with that queue, whether they are assigned to you or not. Everyone who
is a member of that queue can see these activities and cases.
The My Work queue, shown in Figure 26-1, has two folders:
 Assigned: You’ll find all the cases that have been assigned to you. These
are cases that you have not accepted yet.
 In Progress: These are all the cases you have accepted and are currently
working on.
334
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

Creating a Queue
Microsoft CRM can have as many queues as your company needs. We recom-
mend meeting with your service manager and your customer service team to
make a master plan of all your services and products and how you want to
handle customer service scenarios before building your queues.
For example, let’s say Mrs. Reynolds calls in about her Hop-n-Pop Toaster.
The toaster won’t hop when it pops. This call could be routed to the regular
Toasters queue for the next available CSR. However, if she calls to report that
the toaster caught fire, this is a serious issue, one that your company feels
should go straight to management. So you route Mrs. Reynolds to the
Toasters — Emergency queue for a manager to handle.
Another example is a collection agency that has one queue for missed pay-
ments at 30 days and another for more critical debts. Many companies offer
tiered service programs and memberships. With queues, you can make a
battle plan to promptly route those Gold and high-priority memberships to
the faster response-time queues.
Follow these steps to add your new queues:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Settings button.
The Settings window appears on the right.
2. Click Business Unit Settings.
Figure 26-1:
Your folders
in the 
My Work
queue.
335
Chapter 26: Managing Queues

3. Select Queues.
The Queues window appears, as shown in Figure 26-2. All queues are
listed here.
4. In the window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Queue: New window appears, as shown in Figure 26-3. Three fields
are required: Queue Name, Business Unit, and Owner.
5. In the Queue Name field, enter a name for this queue.
Remember to keep it simple and descriptive. Naming the queue on
defective merchandise after your mother-in-law, for example, won’t help
anyone else find it.
6. In the Business Unit field, click the magnifying glass to display the
Look Up Records window.
Business units are similar to departments or regions. For example, if
you’re in the Customer Care department or a regional center, and you
want to create a queue for your staff, you would select Customer Care or
the name of your regional center here. See Chapter 6 more on creating
business units.
7. In the Owner field, choose an owner for the group.
Click the magnifying glass will open a Look Up Records window with all
your users. Choose one and click OK. You are returned to the Queue:
New window. The owner essentially monitors the queue; assigning
cases, shifting workloads and so on.
Figure 26-2:
All current
queues are
displayed
here.
336
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

8. If your company handles trouble “calls” through e-mail from cus-
tomers, enter the e-mail address that the trouble e-mails should go to,
and they will be dropped into this queue.
Suppose that Mrs. Reynolds is on your web page and has a question
about the Hop-n-Pop Toaster’s warranty. She fills in the online form, and
an e-mail is generated with the information and sent to toasters@acme.
com. Enter that e-mail address in the e-mail field on this queue, and her
e-mail will be dropped automatically into, say, the Toasters — General
queue. In the bottom half of the window, you can choose to route all
incoming e-mails or filter down to those from recognized contacts in
your system. (See Chapter 13 for more on contacts.)
9. If you want, enter a description for the queue as well as any important
notes.
10. Click the Save and Close button.
The Queue: New window closes, and you return to the main Queues 
display, where your newly created queue is listed along with the other
queues. The e-mail address and business unit for each queue is also 
displayed.
Figure 26-3:

queues in
this window.
337
Chapter 26: Managing Queues

Activities and Queues
When a new activity (a task, a phone call, an e-mail, an appointment, and so
on.) is created, the program does not automatically assign it to a queue.
Here’s where your service manager ensures his or her job security. They look
at the activity and assess the situation: Does Mrs. Reynolds’s question go to
general customer service or should it be assigned to Bob, who knows the
toaster warranties verbatim? Of course, your service manager assigns the
activity to Bob. This efficient utilization of your company’s resources (that is,
the service manager, Bob’s training, fancy computer equipment) saves time,
prevents redundancy, and most importantly, makes Mrs. Reynolds a happy
customer by getting her an answer in a timely manner.
Now, back to activities and queues. You can view all your queues and activi-
ties from your workplace. In the navigation pane, look under My Work. From
here, you can also view your activities, cases, articles, reports, and
announcements.
Activities should be created first and then assigned to a queue. You can’t
create an activity from within a queue. (See Chapter 14 for details about cre-
ating an activity.)
Assigning an activity to a queue
Let’s revisit Mrs. Reynolds’s problems with her Hop-n-Pop toaster and
assume that you’re the service manager on duty. She’s getting burnt toast
and can’t find the switch to set the level of toastiness. Instead of sending her
call to the General Toasters queue, assign her to the Hop-n-Pop Toasters
queue so that she gets Barb, a specialist in Hop-n-Pop toasters. You can opti-
mize your service staff’s efficiency while promoting customer satisfaction —
what a concept!
As we mentioned earlier in the chapter, activities can be assigned to a queue
or to a user. The difference? Queues can have a number of users assigned to
them, and a user is just that: a single individual.
Keeping that in mind, as the service manager, when should you assign activi-
ties to an individual CSR or manager and when should it be dropped into a
queue for the next available CSR to pick it up?
A good service manager will be able to effectively evaluate all these situa-
tions and assign activities accordingly. Also, initiating workflow rules can
easily help automate the functions of assignments and escalation (see
Chapter 8 for details on rules and workflow).
338
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

Because activities (such as tasks, phone calls, appointments, and e-mails)
and cases are handled the same way within your queues, we occasionally use
activities as a generic term for them all. So within this section, we’re going to
call everything an activity, whether it’s a customer service call or a service
request.
Now you’re set to start assigning activities to queues. Let’s take Mrs. Reynold’s
issue with her toaster. Follow these steps to assign her activity to a queue or
a user:
1. On the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Go To➪My
Work➪Activities.
A list of all your activities is displayed.
2. Locate your activity.
You can sort the activities by clicking the column headers or filter the
activities according date, type, or status (under the View drop-down
list). See Chapter 11 for more on filtering.
3. Double-click the activity to open it.
4. On the menu bar, choose Actions➪Assign.
The Confirm Assignment dialog box appears.
5. Select the queue to which you want to assign this activity:
a. Click the magnifying glass icon.
A Look Up Records dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 26-4.
Figure 26-4:
Search for a
queue and
assign the
activity to it.
339
Chapter 26: Managing Queues

b. In the Look For field, click the arrow and select Queue from the
list.
A list of all current queues is displayed in the lower part of the
screen. You can also assign activities to users from this window.
The assigned user must still accept the activity. (We show you how
to do that in the next section, “Accepting activities.”)
c. Double-click the queue, or highlight the queue and click OK.
You return to the Confirm Assignment dialog box.
You can also search for queues using the Find box or alphabetize the
queues by clicking the Name column header.
6. In the Confirm Assignment dialog box, click OK.
You’re back in the Activity window.
7. Click the Save and Close icon.
Note that the task is still displayed in the Workplace: Activities window
display. It’s still a legitimate activity. However, you can see the task also
in the Queues display because you’ve assigned the task to a queue.
8. Under My Work in the navigation pane, select Queues and find the
queue to which you assigned the activity. Double-click that queue to
open it.
The Queues window appears (refer to Figure 26-1). You now see the
activity assigned to that queue.
Remember to save, Save, SAVE! Always click the Save and Close button, even
if you’re reassigning a previously created activity. This way, you guarantee
that all changes will be saved.
Accepting activities
For this section, let’s become the CSR. We have our caffeine, pictures of the
family, and the latest conceptual macaroni and glitter art adorning our desks.
Service managers, you should read this section as well because good service
managers understand the job from their subordinates’ view.
You will find two types of activities:
 Activities assigned directly to you (in the Assigned folder under My
Work: Queues)
 Activities assigned to a queue that your user name belongs to, which are
found in the public queue in the Queues window
340
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

In either case, you have to accept the activity before you can begin work on
it. If no workflow rules are in place, it’s up to you to monitor your queues for
outstanding activities.
To get to your queues and activities, follow these steps to first accept your
activities:
1. In the lower part of the navigation pane, click the Workplace button.
In the upper part of the pane, select Queues (under My Work).
2. In the pane on the right, click the Assigned folder under My Work or
click a folder under Queues to display any pending activities.
3. Click the activity to highlight it.
4. Click the Accept button in the toolbar.
The Confirm Assignment dialog box appears, asking you to verify that
you want to move the selected activity to your In Progress folder.
5. Click OK.
You’ve now accepted the activity.
After the activity moves to your In Progress folder, you can open it, create
other associated activities, and ultimately complete it. You may also reassign
the activity. For example, suppose Jen gets an activity about the FryjaBox
refrigerator, but she’s the Clean-o-matic Washing Machine whiz. Not to worry,
Jen can turn that activity over to Stan, the FryjaBox guru. Or say you get a
call about a problem that you know Amanda took care of just last week. You
could reassign that call to her.
After the activity is completed, it will no longer be in your In Progress folder.
But you can still find it in the navigation pane. Look under Activities (under
My Work). Or, if it’s a case, look under Cases (under Service).
Queues are a valuable tool for your company. They can be examined for up-
to-the-minute information on how many customers have a specific issue or
how many CSRs are engaged with issues relating to a specific product. This
information can go a long way toward optimizing the efficiency of the service
department and helping identify issues in other departments as well.

W
hether you work as a one-man computer shop or for a multimillion
dollar corporation, you will at some point come across a contract.
Contracts seal the deal, make the world move . . . tell someone you have a
contract and you’re in.
Think about what contracts do. Basically, they outline specific services or
entitlements with a certain number of hours, days, or service calls. They can
also spell out things such as response time and whether the client gets a ded-
icated resource to call.
With Microsoft CRM, you can bill against contracts, keep track of billables
(and do it consistently), set up and organize your contracts, and more.
Microsoft CRM builds contracts on contract templates, as we show you in
this chapter. We also explain how to create a contract and how to link the
contract to a customer and set the contract’s status, terms and conditions.
You’ll also find out how to associate cases with your new contract so you can
accurately and efficiently track your services.
Creating a Contract Template
Templates are one of the best inventions of humankind, right up there with
chocolate and a few actors we can’t name here. Why? Because with a tem-
plate, especially a contract template, you can establish or predefine the vari-
ables (required or not) so that every contract offers the same consistent

appearance and information. Regardless of whether the contract is for soft-
ware support or copier repair or cleaning services, you can build a contract
template specifically for the services you offer.
For this chapter, we’re going to visit Mr. Wayne and his Cobweb Catchers
Cleaning Service. First, follow these steps to create a contract template:
1. At the bottom of the navigation pane, click the Settings button.
2. In the Settings window, click Templates.
3. Click the Contract Templates option.
The Contract Templates window appears, listing all current contract
templates.
4. In the Contract Templates window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Contract Template: New window appears, as shown in Figure 27-1.
5. Fill in the Name and Abbreviation fields.
The name can be anything you want. For the abbreviation, use some-
thing that you think logically abbreviates your contract name.
6. Choose a billing frequency.
Choose your billing cycle, whether it’s monthly, bimonthly, quarterly,
semiannually, or annually.
Figure 27-1:
Build your

344
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

7. Select an Allotment Type.
The three options for providing support are Number of Cases, Time, and
Coverage Dates.
• Number of Cases: Offer your services by the case or call. For
example, you might offer a five-call service package in which
Cobweb Catchers goes to your house five times, regardless of the
length of each visit.
• Time: You can provide your services for an amount of time,
whether it’s hours, days, and so on. For example, Mr. Wayne might
offers his Spring Cleaning Contract as six hours of time.
• Coverage Dates: Set a time frame for your services. For example,
Mr. Wayne’s A Year Dear package covers 12 months of service.
8. If you want, select a service level and discount, and fill in the
Description field.
Use the Service Level field to designate the contract’s status.
9. Fill in the Calendar grid.
Set the days and hours of support this contract offers by clicking in 
the appropriate box. A green dot will appear in the box. In our example,
Mr. Wayne provides his services from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M., Monday through
Friday.
Here’s a quick trick to save clicks: Let’s say your hours are like 
Mr. Wayne’s: 8–5, Monday–Friday. Place your cursor over the number 
8 (AM) on the grid and click. The 8 AM hour for the entire week is filled,
including Saturday and Sunday. Then go to the 5 and do the same thing.
To clear times for Saturday and Sunday, just click the appropriate box.
10. Click the Save and Close icon in the upper-left corner.
The Contract Template: New window closes, and your new contract
appears in the Contract Templates window.
Understanding Contract Status
Before we get into showing you how to create your contracts, let’s go over
the different levels of contract status: draft, invoiced, active, on hold, can-
celled, and expired. Because everyone can see contracts, the status allows
your sales and service staff to be consistent with their answers and support.
Each contract starts out as a draft and automatically moves to active status
once the beginning date has been reached, regardless of whether it’s still a
draft or has been invoiced. Contracts expire on the end date specified in the
contract. Your sales and service staff can place contracts on hold or cancel
them.
345
Chapter 27: Building Contracts

Here’s the list of contract status types:
 Draft: After a contract is created, it automatically has draft status. This
is the default option and allows your staff full access to it for modifica-
tions or updates.
 Invoiced: After the contract is ready for use, it can be invoiced (from the
Actions menu). We’ll show you how to do this later in the chapter. The
dates, contract names, and contract ID can’t be edited after the contract
has been invoiced.
 Active: A contract still in draft status moves to active status automati-
cally after the beginning date set in the contract has been reached. For
example, if your beginning date is July 3, 2006, the contract will go to
active status on that date. As with invoiced contracts, the dates, con-
tract names, and contract ID can’t be edited after the contract becomes
active.
 Expired: A contract expires automatically on the end date set in the con-
tract. After this happens, no new cases can be opened against it
(although existing cases can be closed). Expired contracts can only be
renewed and can’t be edited in any fashion.
 Cancelled: A contract that is active or invoiced can be canceled (from
the Actions menu). Canceled contracts can’t be edited.
 On Hold: A contract may be placed on hold (from the Actions menu).
While a contract is on hold, cases may not be logged against it. To take it
off hold, choose Release Hold from the Actions menu.
Creating a Contract
Now that you and Mr. Wayne have created your contract template and have
been briefed on contract status, you’re ready for business. That’s a good
thing because Mrs. Reynolds is on the phone and wants her home cleaned.
After you’ve met with her and discussed her needs, you can create a contract
for her using your spiffy new contract template.
Here’s how to create a contract:
1. In the lower part of the navigation pane, click the Service button. In
the upper part of the pane, select Contracts.
2. In the Contracts window’s toolbar, click the New button.
The Template Explorer dialog box appears.
3. Double-click the contract template we created earlier.
The Contract: New window appears, as shown in Figure 27-2. For our
example, we’ll choose the D4BR Template to create the contract for 
Mrs. Reynolds.
346
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

We’d like to point out two things about this Contract: New window. First,
as with most of Microsoft CRM, the fields in red (on your screen) are
required. Second, you can’t modify the Contract ID field. The contract ID
is generated automatically when you click the Save and Close button to
create the contract. However, your system administrator can specify
some of the characteristics of the contract ID.
4. In the Contract Name field, enter a name for the contract.
For our example, we’ve used Mrs. Reynolds’s last name and her street
address
5. Fill in the Customer field.
To do so, click the magnifying glass and select the customer from the
Look Up Records window. You can also open the Form Assistant on the
right of the screen, and select Customer from the drop-down list. When
you do, a list of customers appears, as shown in Figure 27-3. You also
have the option to search by contact or account.
6. Enter the contract start and end dates.
You can use the calendars or enter the dates manually.
7. Use the magnifying glass to select the Bill To Customer.
The Form Assistant pane is updated with the appropriate addresses.
Select the one you want by double-clicking.
Figure 27-2:

Chapter 27: Building Contracts

8. Although the Contract Address and Bill To Address fields are not
required, save yourself some time and add them now.
To do so, click the arrow in the top field of the Form Assistant pane, and
select the Contract Address and Bill To Address options in turn.
Although the addresses are not displayed in the appropriate address
fields in the Contract: New window, an index card icon confirms that the
addresses have been associated with the contract.
It’s worth taking the time to add these addresses now because you need
them later when you change the contract’s status.
9. Click Save (the disk icon) to record these addresses.
10. Click the Details tab in the Contract: New window and fill it in as 
necessary.
The only required fields (Contract Template and Owner) are already
filled in. You can choose the type of discount you want the customer to
have (percentage or amount) and enter a description for the contract.
11. To add a note, do so on the Notes tab.
12. Click Save (the disk icon).
Your contract is now a draft. Keep this in mind for the rest of the chap-
ter. We’ll be moving it out of draft status later.
Figure 27-3:

Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

Now that you’ve saved the contract, the following options are live. These
options allow you to enter or view information relative to the contract during
its life:
 Information: You entered the initial information for the contract here.
 Contract Lines: This option outlines what the contract covers. Several
Contract Lines (for example, hardware, software, parts, and mainte-
nance) can be associated with a single contract.
 Activities: This is where you find every activity scheduled as part of 
the support in the contract, such as phone calls, e-mails, tasks, and
appointments.
 History: All completed or closed activities go here.
 Cases: All cases or trouble tickets go here.
Shortcut alert! For the most part, your contracts will contain a lot of the same
information (such as billing frequency or pricing). Instead of creating a con-
tract from the template, you can open a contract similar to the one you want
to create and copy it.
Follow these steps to copy a contract:
1. In the lower part of the navigation pane, click the Service button. In
the upper part of the pane, select Contracts.
2. Double-click the contract you want to copy.
We recommend that you write down the current contract ID number.
When you get to Step 3, the contract is copied with all the same informa-
tion except the contract ID. The program generates a new contract ID for
the new contract you’re creating. The only way you can tell your new
contract from the old one is by the contract ID.
3. On the main menu (at the top of the screen), choose Actions➪
Copy Contract.
The Create From Existing Contract dialog box appears. You can choose
to copy over cancelled contract lines as well, just by selecting the box in
this window. (For more on contract lines, see the next section.)
4. Click OK.
You return to the open contract window. The new contract usually takes
a minute to pop up, so be sure to keep an eye on that contract ID.
5. Check the contract ID to make sure you’re using the new contract.
6. Go ahead and change the new contract information.
For our example, we made a new contract for Mrs. Reynolds’s neighbor,
Mr. Cobb, by copying her contract and giving it a new name, as shown in
Figure 27-4.
349
Chapter 27: Building Contracts

Adding Contract Lines to a New Contract
Now that you have your new contracts for Mrs. Reynolds and Mr. Cobb set
up, it’s time to outline the services you’re offering. Keep in mind that while
we’re using services in our examples, you could set up contracts for selling
products as well.
A description of what you’re offering your client is called a contract line. For
example, you might offer the friendly neighbors a weekly cleaning (to include
dusting, vacuuming, swabbing, and polishing the furniture) every Tuesday at
10:00 AM and specialty cleaning once a month or once every two months.
Let’s say you’re also giving them a free inspection of their carpet every six
months. We’ll put a variation in there and say that Mrs. Reynolds has a 100-
year-old armoire she wants polished only once a month and Mr. Cobb has
asked that his collection of antique telephones be excluded from the clean-
ing. He’ll dust those himself.
The Contract Line: New window has three tabs: General, Administration, and
Notes. The General tab has areas for the following:
 General information, such as the name of the contract line and the 
product
 Allotment details, which show the total minutes or cases, how many
have been used and how many remain, and pricing
 Total price, which shows the price for the product for this contract

The Contract Lines window for that contract appears.
4. In the window’s toolbar, click the New Contract Line button.
In our example, shown in Figure 27-5, we’re using Mr. Cobb’s antique
phone collection. Note that the Form Assistant window is collapsed.
5. In the first section, type a title for this contract line and choose the
start and end dates.
These three fields are required, but the others in the top section are not.
You can enter the dates manually or select them from the drop-down
boxes.
6. In the Allotment Details section, enter the number of minutes or cases
you want to specify for this contract.
The other two fields are optional and show how much has been used
and how much is left.

Chapter 27: Building Contracts

7. In the Pricing section, enter the total price for this product for this
contract.
Of the remaining fields under Pricing, Discount is the only one you can
fill in. Keep in mind that the amount or percentage of the discount is
determined by what was entered for this product on the product list.
The other two fields are filled in automatically based on the discount
you enter. Net is the total after the discount is applied.
8. Click Save (the disk icon).
9. Click the Administration tab, and check your customer. Enter a serial
number if necessary.
The customer field is required and should already be filled in. The serial
number field is optional and is a good place to track product serial num-
bers against the contract (say for inventory or quality assurance).
10. On the Notes tab, enter information important to this contract.
The Notes tab, like the other Notes areas in Microsoft CRM, offers a free-
form place to enter data.
11. Click the Save and Close icon.
The new contract line appears in the Contract window’s main display.
You see the contract line’s title, product, allotments remaining, and net
(a dollar amount).
Clicking any column heading sorts the list of contract lines by that criterion.
Now that you’ve added the meat to the contract, you can see how Microsoft
CRM can track things such as time, available cases, or remaining minutes. In
just a few clicks and a glance, you can easily see the status and details of a
contract. We know what that translates to: getting information to the cus-
tomer quickly, which means happy customers.
As we mentioned, you can move a contract from draft to invoiced status, if
the start date has not yet been reached.
Follow these steps to move a contract from draft to invoiced status:
1. In the lower part of the navigation pane, click the Service button. In
the upper part of the pane, select Contracts.
The Contracts window appears.
2. Double-click the contract you created earlier.
3. On the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Actions➪Invoice
Contract.
The status of the contract, displayed in the lower-left corner of the
window, is updated to Invoiced (if the start date has not yet been
reached) or Active (if the start date has been reached).
352
Part V: Taking Care of Your Customers 

Expired contracts are automatically updated to expired status on their end
date. The other status levels — cancelled, on hold, and renew — can be
updated.
Renewing a Contract
As we mentioned, you can renew cancelled or expired contracts in a few
short steps:
1. In the lower part of the navigation pane, click the Service button. In
the upper part of the pane, select Contracts.
The Contracts window appears.
2. Double-click the contract you want to renew.
3. In the menu bar (at the top of the screen), choose Actions➪
Renew Contract.
The Renew Contract dialog box appears, asking for verification and
whether you want to copy the cancelled contract lines as well.
4. Click OK.
Keep an eye on the status in the lower-left corner. When you renew a
contract, its status is changed automatically to draft.
Creating a Case and Linking It 
to a Contract
Now that we’ve set Mr. Cobb and Mrs. Reynolds up with their cleaning con-
tracts, Mr. Wayne and his service staff can take calls. That’s a good thing
because Mr. Cobb is on the phone, wanting to take advantage of the Mothers
Know All cleaning advice package, which is good for the life of his contract.
He gets ten free phone incidents for cleaning advice. In Mr. Cobb’s case, it’s a
doozie. Seems his pet raccoon got into the trash and grape jelly paw prints
are all over his 40-year-old Persian rug.
Your customer service representative takes the call and starts a case for 
Mr. Cobb to track the resolution process. You find out how to create a case in
Chapter 25. Here, we show you how to associate that case to the contract.
See the instructions in Chapter 25 on opening a new case. Then follow these
steps to link the new case to Mr. Cobb’s contract.
353
Chapter 27: Building Contracts

1. In the newly created case, go to the Form Assistant and select
Contract from the first drop-down menu.
Available contracts associated with the customer are listed in the Form
Assistant under the lookup field. Only active and invoiced contracts
appear.
2. Find and select the contract.
The Contract field under Contract and Product Information in the main
window should now be filled in (see Figure 27-6). Now that you’ve
assigned the contract, you have to assign the contract line associated
with this call.
3. Click the magnifying glass icon to the right of the Contract Lines field.
The Look Up Records dialog box appears, listing all the contract lines
associated with this contract.
4. Find the contract line, highlight it, and click OK.
The case is now properly linked to the contract, and any work performed
while resolving the case will be tracked against the active contract.
5. Click the Save and Close button.
Remember the cardinal rule of computers: save, Save, SAVE!

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
You can find many official and unofficial independent
software vendors (ISVs), all madly developing add-on
products for Microsoft CRM. We have reviewed the best
products and present the top ten in Chapter 28. 
Everyone needs a little help once in a while. In Chapter 29,
we describe the best places for getting an essential tip,
training, or consulting.

 Enhancing your field service tools
A
dd-on products are developed by vendors outside Microsoft who have
identified some niche or integration that Microsoft has not yet filled.
Because CRM has been around before Microsoft CRM, some third-party appli-
cations are also available for other CRM products.
As of this writing, there are hundreds of registered developers for Microsoft
CRM products and a considerable list of products. We also maintain our own
web site, with a current list of the third-party products available. We include
brochures, product descriptions, and downloads from the different develop-
ers as well as the official list of registered products. You’ll also find many
unregistered products. You can view the list at
www.microsoftCRMProducts.com
In addition, Microsoft keeps a list of registered products at
http://www.microsoft.com/businesssolutions/
industrysolutions.aspx

To cull the list in this chapter to just ten, we established several criteria:
 General applicability: CRM is about managing prospect and client data.
And it’s about making it easier for a team of users to work together. If an
add-on module didn’t address one or both of these issues, it didn’t make
the cut.
 Integration with Microsoft CRM: Many vendors advertise their products
as Microsoft CRM add-ons even when little, if any, integration exists. If
there is little integration or no apparent reason for the integration, the
product didn’t make the cut.
 History of and support from vendor: The CRM dealer industry is still a
cottage industry, with dealers coming and going. Often a vendor writes a
custom application for one client and then decides to offer it as a gen-
eral product to an unsuspecting public. We’ve tried to check out the ven-
dors and their motivation as well. Evaluating motivation, of course, is
much more subjective than the first two criteria.
 Updated for Version 3: Some of the less popular add-ons for Version 1
have not been overhauled for Version 3. Any add-on we mention works
with Version 3.
Just because a product doesn’t appear in this chapter doesn’t mean that you
shouldn’t be interested in it. The product may not have been available for
review at the time of this writing, or it may be of special interest to your com-
pany but not of more general interest. And, conversely, just because a prod-
uct appears in this chapter doesn’t mean that you should buy it without
further evaluation.
Many developers put out advertising materials on products that they are
thinking about developing. That is vaporware. Before plunking down your
hard-earned money, make sure that the product exists and has documenta-
tion and support — maybe even a reference site or two.
Converting and Integrating 
with Scribe Insight
www.scribesoft.com, 603-622-5109
According to Microsoft, most Microsoft CRM installations that use an ISV
product include Scribe Insight. This is remarkable and earns Scribe our first-
place vote.
358
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Many companies using Microsoft CRM are coming from some other CRM
package such as ACT! or GoldMine. It’s not easy getting all your data out of
one of these packages and into something else. Scribe Insight contains tem-
plates for converting the data from either of these packages into Microsoft
CRM Version 3. Without such a utility, you’d be hard-pressed to get much
more than just simple contact information from these packages. With Scribe,
all the activities, such as appointments, phone calls, and related notes, are
migrated to Microsoft CRM.
After your data is in Microsoft CRM and you’re using the system, you may
want to integrate CRM with some other application, such as your accounting
system, your ERP system, or your data-mining application. Again, Scribe is
your prime source for those migrations.
Although you could use the Microsoft Data Migration Framework, it usually
involves some knowledge of programming and SQL Server. Scribe simplifies
this task and makes data conversion easier.
Increasing Your Productivity
Third-party developers (like us and others out there) are here to help out
Microsoft. After all, they can’t think of everything (even though Microsoft
CRM comes darn close). As ISV Partners with Microsoft, we can easily add to
Microsoft CRM’s functionality with our products, therefore increasing your
return on investment. As developers, we think that two of the best are c360
and Axonom.
Productivity packs from c360
www.c360.com, 678-781-3189
According to Microsoft, c360’s productivity packs are included in about half
of Microsoft CRM implementations. That’s more than good enough for
Microsoft to have awarded c360 the 2005 Microsoft Partner Choice ISV of 
the year.
c360 packages groups of utilities into three productivity packs: a Core
Productivity Pack, one for sales, and another for service.
359
Chapter 28: Ten Add-Ons

The Core Productivity Pack includes the following:
 A utility for combining multiple screen views into one screen to reduce
the number of clicks to get from one screen to another.
 Duplicate record detection across multiple record types. For example, if
you enter a new lead record for ABC Corp., it can check to make sure
that ABC Corp. does not already exist as an account record.
 Alerts that trigger pop-up windows based on any type of record.
 Roll-up summaries for all record types.
 Relationship charting to see how various records in the database relate
to each other.
 E-mail linking that simplifies connecting an e-mail to a CRM record.
The Sales Pack includes:
 An enhancement to CRM’s forecasting.
 A connection to your web site to automate creating and updating
records. This is particularly useful if you combine this automation with
workflow to automatically respond to inquiries.
The Service Pack includes:
 The ability to link e-mails to cases
 A workplace configuration that enhances the use of queues
c360 also has industry-specific vertical tools but nothing for the marketing
module yet. c360’s web site provides a nice tour of all features.
Axonom’s Powertrak
www.axonom.com, 952-653-0351
Several Microsoft competitors have positioned themselves against Microsoft
CRM by claiming Microsoft’s product is not vertically oriented, meaning it has
no solutions for particular industries. And in most cases, they’re right — as
long as you don’t look at all the rapidly developing third-party products.
360
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Powertrak, from Axonom, provides industry-specific templates extending the
range of Microsoft CRM. They have modules for advanced marketing, techni-
cal case management, call center, multichannel portals, Ecommerce, and time
and billing. The real news here may be the templates for retail, financial, non-
profit associations, and high-tech manufacturing. In particular, the wealth
management system (which features house-holding, a method of rolling
related peoples’ accounts into one view) is of interest.
eBridge BizTalk Server Adapter
www.ebridgesoft.com, 800-755-6921 ext. 315
Microsoft provides links from CRM to its accounting packages. But if you’re
not using a Microsoft accounting system, you need third-party middleware.
The eBridge adapter provides bidirectional integration between Microsoft
CRM and a long list of accounting applications to ensure that critical busi-
ness information is synchronized across the enterprise. Application adapters
include Microsoft Business Solutions, Microsoft Business Solutions, Solomon,
Sage products, QuickBooks, and Peachtree. To see the entire list, go to

Chapter 28: Ten Add-Ons
A thought on hosting
Hosting of various software applications and
particularly CRM has become popular. The suc-
cess of Salesforce.com is testament to that.
While hosting CRM is not technically an add-on
product, a little discussion here is appropriate.
If you don’t have the infrastructure or the tech-
nical personnel for the proper care and feeding
of CRM, you can have it hosted for you. CRM is
a web-based application anyway, so it’s a good
candidate for third-party hosting. You trade
much less investment in equipment and staff 
for a likely long-term rental commitment. Our
financial analyses indicate that if your intention
is to use the software for less than 36 months,
it’s often more cost effective to use an outside
hosting facility.
A wide variety of companies provide hosting for
Microsoft CRM. They range from companies
who just host it to those who fully manage your
customizations and much more. For a list of
partners who can host Microsoft CRM for you,
visit
http://www.microsoft.com/crm.

Quotes and Proposals
Quotations are usually simple, one- or two-page listings of items, prices,
terms, and conditions. Proposals are usually much longer, with detailed dis-
cussions, literature, plans, references, and pricing.
Getting more from your quotes
www.quotewerks.com, 407-248-1481
Microsoft CRM includes a pretty good quotation system, but if you need
something more configurable, you may want to look at QuoteWerks from
Aspire. We’ve been using their quoting products for many years (long before
Microsoft CRM Version 1 appeared).
QuoteWerks is a solid, cost-effective product that allows you to develop con-
figurable quotes and then print and e-mail them. Forecasts and follow-ups are
automatically logged in CRM. For an excellent description of the program’s
capabilities, go to
www.quotewerks.com/mscrm.asp
Proposals and RFPs
www.pragmatech.com, 603-672-8941
www.santcorp.com, 800-272-0047
RFPs and proposals are slightly different animals. RFP software is designed to
recognize questions from prospective clients and organize your answers.
Proposals are usually done according to your company’s order and method-
ology. In any event, automating your proposals should allow even those not
gifted with writing skills to put together professional-looking work.
Whether you’re responding to a series of questions or creating your own pro-
posals, Pragmatech’s software should greatly reduce the time and effort
required and should result in a higher win ratio as the quality and consis-
tency of your responses improve. Sant Software also offers proposal and RFP
generation linked to CRM.
Here’s the rub. Whether you use software from Pragmatech or Sant or someone
else, setting it up requires a significant amount of effort. Someone at your com-
pany who can write well and has experience with your products and sales must
be involved in the initial design of the system. And for a system like this to be
cost-effective, your company must send at least one or two proposals a week.
362
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Proposal-generating systems can run as stand-alone systems without inte-
grating with a CRM product, so we almost eliminated this entire category. But
this genre of software has enough merit to be included here.
Alerts and Alarms
www.vineyardsoft.com, 802-899-1265
Workflow functionality is built into Microsoft CRM. With workflow, you can
automate a variety of business rules and processes. However, workflow
works only with the files that are part of Microsoft CRM. Workflow can’t trig-
ger activity based on data that might be in an accounting system or in an HR
system. KnowledgeSync from VineyardSoft fills that gap.
KnowledgeSync 2000 is a business-activity monitoring application that
detects and responds to critical, time-sensitive data in Microsoft CRM, in
incoming e-mail, and in many other applications. KnowledgeSync 2000
updates Microsoft CRM, other databases, and users (through e-mail, faxes,
pagers, and the web) with critical information. KnowledgeSync comes with
many canned alerts (called EventPaks). To develop a customized alert, you
may want to find a specialist — probably a VineyardSoft partners.
KnowledgeSync can easily alert you to a variety of conditions within your
database. Here are a few examples:
 A forecasted sale is suddenly overdue.
 A lead distributed to an outside salesperson has not been pursued.
 Money has come in (or has not come in) from a client.
 A deal was closed.
Business Intelligence
www.rapidinsightinc.com, 603-447-1980
Your Microsoft CRM system contains some of the most valuable information
your company owns. Just as important is the history your company has with
each prospect and customer. That history is like an audit trail of everything
that has been done, whether it was done well or not. And there is much to be
learned by analyzing that history.
363
Chapter 28: Ten Add-Ons

Business intelligence systems provide statistical analysis and graphical tools
to help analyze what has already happened and help predict what might
happen. For example, it’s useful to ask such questions as the following:
 How does our rate of closing deals relate to the number of times we call
on a prospect or to whom we assign the prospect or to which product
we are trying to sell?
 Which marketing activities are actually paying off?
 What percentage of cases has each support person successfully closed,
and what percentage are still open and unresolved?
 What is our historic customer retention rate and how does our retention
rate correlate with the number of contacts we make with each customer,
who is assigned to handle the account, and the products we are selling?
One of the most flexible, powerful, and effective business intelligence sys-
tems comes from a new company called Rapid Insight, Inc. If you want to
understand what business processes are working and which ones need
adjustment, you will use a tool such as Rapid Insight Analytics. You will ana-
lyze what you have been doing, predict what is likely to happen if you con-
tinue with the same processes, and try to predict results of new processes.
Business intelligence systems is a highly specialized area that requires exper-
tise in process design, statistics, and modeling. You can find additional infor-
mation and resources on Rapid Insight Analytics and on client retention
systems at www.ccc24k.com/business-intelligence.htm.
Enhancing Field Service Organization
www.fieldpoint.net, 866-336-5282
Fieldpoint has created an advanced Field Service Application for Microsoft
CRM. If you’re looking to extend CRM 3 to support professional service orga-
nizations such as IT and managed service providers, software companies,
consultants, and repair professionals, this add-on might be just the ticket.

Chapter 29
Ten Ways to Get Help
In This Chapter
 Using Microsoft CRM’s online help
 Getting the straight story from newsgroups
 Finding an expert
 Investing in training
 Microsoft services
 Getting in touch with the authors
 Accessing general CRM resources online
You can get help with Microsoft CRM in so many ways that it’s hard to
whittle it down to just ten. Free help is available through CRM’s online
help system and from the newsgroups. Then there’s paid help from dealers,
developers, and Microsoft itself. If you’re anything like us, you’ll try the free
stuff first.
The newsgroups are becoming more popular as Microsoft CRM’s popularity
spreads. Subscribing to a newsgroup now and getting comfortable with the
posting process is a good idea. As time goes by, more and more users will be
sharing information, best practices, and the inevitable workarounds. 
Microsoft Partners can be found all over the world, and they serve as your
best and often local support. Beyond that group is a cadre of Independent
Software Vendors (ISVs), ready to sell you their custom CRM add-on products
(see Chapter 28). Don’t overlook ISVs as resources, too. They have a lot of
experience dealing with the substance of CRM’s programming code and can
offer insights into problems you may encounter. These developers can also
help you design custom enhancements to the program. After all, that’s their
business.
Note: The links in this chapter were accurate when they were initially
researched but may, due to the dynamic nature of the web, change or disap-
pear over time. If a link no longer works, please accept our apologies. In addi-
tion, new sites are appearing all the time. The best way to locate information
about Microsoft CRM is to open your search engine of choice and type
Microsoft CRM in the Search field. 

Using CRM’s Built-in Help
No doubt about it, the quickest way to get a simple question answered is to
go to the built-in help that comes with the software. The price is right and the
system is easy to use and will probably answer 80 percent of the basic ques-
tions you’re likely to have.
You can get to the built-in help feature by selecting Help from the main menu
on most screens or by clicking the blue question mark icon on the toolbar.
The screen shown in Figure 29-1 appears, providing you with a choice of
topics that relate to the area of the software you’re working with. 
Figure 29-1:
Asking for 
a special
topic.
366
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

You can drill down on any of these topics by clicking the topic of interest. Or,
if this isn’t exactly what you had in mind, you can search for another topic as
follows:
1. In the Look For field at the top of the pane, enter a keyword.
2. Click the Find button. 
Additional topics appear below the Look For field. Each additional
topics has a radio button. 
3. To find help on an additional topic, click the appropriate radio
button.
The help text appears at the bottom of the pane. 
4. When you’ve finished exploring everything the built-in help has to
offer, click the X in the upper-right corner to close the window and
return to CRM.
Getting the Straight Story 
from Newsgroups
Far and away, newsgroups are the most interesting place to find out what is
really going on. They’re free and Microsoft CRM makes it easy to access
them. Let the buyer beware, however. You get what you pay for.
Within the newsgroup threads (a thread is a chain of related responses), you
will find input from users, dealers, developers, and an occasional response
from someone at Microsoft. Mostly the tone is polite and professional.
Usually the information is correct — but not always.
If you have a question or a problem, you should first see whether an existing
thread relates to your issue. If so, you read through that thread. You may be
pleasantly surprised to find that your question has been addressed. If you
don’t find a thread that looks like your problem, you should start a new
thread.
To access the newsgroups:
1. Click Help from the main menu (on almost any screen).
A list of menu choices appears.
2. Click the second option, Microsoft CRM Online. 
3. Enter one or two keywords relating to your topic. 
For example, we entered Sales Literature, as shown in Figure 29-2.
367
Chapter 29: Ten Ways to Get Help

4. Click the Go button.
All existing threads related to your keywords appear. Figure 29-3 shows
six threads that relate to Sales Literature.
5. Click whichever thread seems most relevant and interesting. 
6. You can then browse through the “conversations” everyone has been
having. 
If you don’t find an answer to your question, you can start your own thread:
1. From the newsgroup area, click the New button (refer to Figure 29-3).
2. When asked whether you want to submit a question, a suggestion, or a
comment, make a selection.
You see a screen where you can begin your new thread. 
3. Enter as much as you can about your issue, and then click Post (at the
bottom of the window). 
This submits your issue to the world. 
Figure 29-2:
Getting to a
newsgroup
thread.
368
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

4. Go about the rest of your business for a while. 
Please note that “a while” might be minutes, hours, or days. 
5. Return to the newsgroup area occasionally to see whether anyone has
responded. 
Chances are that within a day various people will have replied with help-
ful advice.
Finding an Expert
First, you should know there are a lot of dealers, many of whom are bona fide
experts. Actually, Microsoft calls them partners, although one would have to
use that term loosely. Finding dealers and developers is one thing; choosing
the right one can be a challenge.
There are also developers. These are primarily technical shops specializing
in creating custom software and various add-on products. You can almost
consider them a subset of the dealer channel, except developers usually
Figure 29-3:
Newsgroup
threads
regarding
the Sales
Literature
area.
369
Chapter 29: Ten Ways to Get Help

don’t sell or install CRM. That said, some dealers also develop custom soft-
ware, and some developers sell CRM.
The dealer and developer community is a prime place to go for serious help.
If you need assistance with installation, customization, training, integration
with other software, importing data, or just routine support, there is no
better place to go. Expect to pay for this service. In the United States, rates
range from $140 to $200 per hour.
Microsoft does not publish a comprehensive list of all their CRM dealers. One
way to get a few names is to go to the following web address:
http://www.microsoft.com/dynamics/crm/purchase/default.
mspx#EDAA
This link brings you directly to Microsoft’s Inside Sales Department, which
will match you up with several qualified experts.
Microsoft has a special category of consultants with serious expertise and
commitment. Microsoft calls them MVPs. You can easily find them by follow-
ing these steps: 
1. From the main menu of most screens, click Help.
A list of menu choices appears.
2. Click the second option, Microsoft CRM Online.
The window we saw back in Figure 29-3 appears. Scroll down a bit until
you see a hyperlink to Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs).
3. Click the MVP hyperlink. 
4. In the left pane, select MVP Awardees. In the center of the window,
select Microsoft Dynamics CRM. 
5. Scroll through the series of names, biographies, and contact 
information.
Another way to find experts is to surf the web. We like Google, and it’s cer-
tainly useful for finding almost every person or company serious about
Microsoft CRM. Other search engines will also work, of course. Some key
search words follow: Microsoft CRM, Microsoft CRM dealer, Microsoft CRM
partner, Microsoft CRM developer, Microsoft CRM add-ons, and Microsoft
CRM training.
Don’t be fooled into thinking that a shaded listing at the top or in the right pane
of the Google window guarantees expertise. It guarantees only that the com-
pany is paying the most to gain your attention. Surf with caution and a little
suspicion. Lowest prices and the best service usually don’t go well together.
370
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Another interesting and independent site is 
http://www.mscrmexperts.com
Investing in Training
A key ingredient to a successful implementation of Microsoft CRM is 
training — end-user training and administrative training. Overlook these and
your implementation will not be a success. New training materials and com-
panies are appearing so rapidly that a list printed here will quickly become
outdated. Again, surfing the web (using the keywords “microsoft crm train-
ing”) or asking your dealer is probably the best approach to finding the right
training.
Training is a tradeoff in time, budget, and commitment. In the following list,
we itemize the best training at the top, with a gradual descent toward barely
useful:
 Send all your users to a training facility away from your office and daily
distractions. Maui is good.
 Bring an experienced Microsoft CRM trainer to the facility and make
sure it really is a training facility.
 Have your own in-house trainer get trained and come back to train all
your users. This is almost never as good as having an experienced CRM
trainer do the job, but it is less expensive.
 Find some live web-based training that each of your users can access.
 Find a web-based or CD-based tutorial for your users.
 Attend free webinars.
 Just tell each user to use the new software. Some of them will probably
get it.
Microsoft offers many types of training, not only for their CRM product but
also for many of their other business software products. A good starting
point to find out about all these options is
http://www.microsoft.com/learning/training/default.asp
And, of course, buy each user a copy of this For Dummies book. Give each
one a raise after they’ve read it.

Microsoft Packaged Service and Support

vices. They each cost real money, but it may be money well spent. Design and
planning always pay off in the end. You can access the details of Microsoft’s
programs by going to

The QuickStart and QuickPlan programs are meant to help you before instal-
lation. Express Consulting and the Software Assurance programs are
designed to help you once you already have the software.
QuickStart
Microsoft’s QuickStart program is intended to help you in the decision-
making process — before you purchase any software. There is a fee for this
program. Dealers have offered similar programs for a long time, usually under
the heading of needs analysis.
The advantage of going with Microsoft’s QuickStart program is that you have
access to Microsoft’s experts in their Professional Services Organization.
That’s a good thing. They have a structured and tested methodology for
examining your current situation and future needs. Their intent is to match
your needs with their offerings. There are pros and cons to this. 
The benefit to QuickStart is that you get an in-depth view of the product, an
assessment of whether and how it will work for you, and the beginnings of an
implementation plan.
QuickStart will most likely lead you down the path toward a Microsoft CRM
implementation. Microsoft’s Professional Services Group is very good, but
their focus is on Microsoft’s product line. They will certainly try to make
Microsoft CRM fit your organization’s needs. If you have not yet determined
what specific CRM product is best for your situation, you may want to con-
duct your own independent research before signing up for QuickStart.
QuickPlan
Microsoft’s QuickPlan program is the next step after QuickStart or after
you’ve decided that Microsoft CRM is the right product for you. Although
QuickPlan was designed by Microsoft, it is run through their Dealer Channel
with some backup from Microsoft. That is, you’ll be working with a specially
trained dealer, not with Microsoft directly.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

The purpose of QuickPlan is to spend two weeks designing your implementa-
tion and preparing your organization for that implementation. This is money
well spent and is particularly critical if your application involves more than a
handful of users or requires customization or integration with other software.
Express Consulting
Microsoft’s Express Consulting is used instead of or in addition to hiring a con-
sultant, dealer, or developer to assist you. Note, however, that relying too heav-
ily on Microsoft’s Express Consulting, or on any outside consulting, may
undermine the growth of your company’s own internal expertise. Any CRM
implementation is a living, growing, and evolving system. Weaning your organi-
zation away from outside consultants is a good long-range goal. Official techni-
cal support and software upgrades are also available directly from Microsoft. 
Software Assurance
Microsoft offers five levels and plans for CRM support. The details of
Microsoft service plans can be found on their web site at this address:
http://www.microsoft.com/dynamics/crm/support/
serviceplans.mspx
The five levels are Open or Open Value Program, Select or the Enterprise
Agreement Program, Full Packaged Product Maintenance, Deluxe Support,
and Flex Support. The plans you qualify for and the plan you select should
reflect your need for help and for updates. Do not assume that because you
purchased Microsoft Dynamics CRM 3.0 that you will never need an update.
You’ll definitely want to stay current with future releases of the software, and
you shouldn’t seriously consider a plan that doesn’t include those updates.
Next, you should think about how often you’re likely to call for help and your
tolerance for waiting for a response. If you’re a Type A personality or the
application is truly mission critical for your company, the Open Value
Program, offering a three-hour response, might not be ideal. 
CustomerSource is a web portal that allows you access to a considerable
amount of information about each of your Microsoft products. If you have any
of the five plans just described, you should have access to CustomerSource.
(If you have one of those plans and have paid for maintenance in the last 12
months but don’t have access to CustomerSource, contact your dealer for
instructions regarding access.)
CustomerSource will also provide you with detailed information about vari-
ous types of training that are available. In addition, you can search the official
Microsoft knowledge base, submit support incidents, and much more.

Chapter 29: Ten Ways to Get Help

Getting in Touch with Us
We use Microsoft CRM. We write about Microsoft CRM. We even sell it occa-
sionally. We have a team of experts who do nothing but CRM consulting. We
can even help you find additional resources, if that’s what’s needed. You can
get in touch with either of us at the following address: 
dummies@crmworldclass.com
Accessing General CRM 
Resources Online
Not to be confusing, but the CRM in this section is not related specifically to
Microsoft CRM. These CRM resources are dedicated to client relationship
management in general. Much of the information on the web sites we list here
doesn’t deal with software. Instead, it’s about the philosophy and concepts
behind more actively managing your customer base.
A solid understanding of CRM concepts can enhance your Microsoft CRM
investment. Here are a few resources to get you started:
 www.crmguru.com: Membership is free. Newsletters arrive directly in
your e-mail. This site has a Community Forum link and a Guru Panel link.
The site also features a searchable GuruBase.
 www.crmdaily.com: The site’s self-proclaimed description is Real-Time
CRM Industry News from Around the World, but we think it’s best
described as an online newspaper. Articles are fresh, and the layout is
great. Each article has a brief overview on the front page with a link to
the details. This site also has a searchable archive.
 www.crm2day.com: Excellent articles and a concise design make this
page easy to read. It features an Experts Corner and a searchable library,
which puts a lot of great CRM information only a few clicks away. And
the free company listing is great for networking!
We hope this chapter provides you with a good start. Everyone needs a little
help when they’re first starting or even later when digging a little deeper into
a new feature.
