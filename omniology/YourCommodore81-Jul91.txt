KEEPING UP

'Indiana Jones and the lost

turned down by Harrison
Ford 'cos he was fed up with
being stereotyped (in ﬁlms
with incredibly long names,
maybe)!
Rumour has it that Jeffrey
actually turned down a part
as an extra - but that's not
important 'cos U S Gold are

YC RECIPE CORNER
It's Back and Doing The Continental!
This month's tasty treat comes from Loco Larsson in
Sweden who wrote to YC with the secret recipe to give you
more time to play your fav games and to help you live longer
(without any friends - Ed).
YOU WILL NEED
10 well cleaned tin cans
10 cans of baked beans
5kg of meat cut in small pieces (beansize)
4 onions chopped in small pieces
1 or more garlic (the more you use the more ﬂies you kill)
Butter & spices
WOT YOU DO
Fry the onions, garlic and the meat, slop in the beans, add
spices, and stir it all together. Divide between the tins and
place in the freezer. Take tins out when required, heat
accordingly, pause game and EAT.
Ermm yes, Loco, you're off your rocker and with all those
beans and garlic who would dare disturb you from your
game playing!
SUPER DUPER
The game that was
renowned for making
'chomp chomp splat'
noises and which caused a
big rumpus (well, two really)
when Page 3 'girlie' Maria
Whitaker was signed up to
adorn the packaging is
back!
Barbarian III or Super
Barbarian as Palace want it
to be called, is now on the
drawing boards. The third
game is being developed
in-house, so it promises to
include all the good or
face-to-face hack 'n' slay
playability of the ﬁrst.
The game is due to be
released sometime next
year (boo-hoo) but it'll be
worth the wait and it also
gives Palace enough time
to inter(view) all the
prospective packaging
'girls' (hoorah) which is
obviously the most
important part of the game!
Bust-enlargers at the
ready!

Titus certainly haven't got the
blues after signing up the
'Blues Brothers
If you don't already know
(where have you been for the
last 10 years, come out from
under that mushroom), the
'Blues Brothers' is a cult 1980
ﬁlm which starred an
amazingly thin Dan Akroyd of
Ghostbusters fame and Jim
Belushi. who (sadly) died a
few years ago from a drugs
overdose, (just say no, kids!).
Apart from including all
the groovy tracks like
'Everybody Needs
Somebody', and the cool
shades, the basic plot of the
ﬁlm is the two brothers (one
of which has just got out of
jail), trying desperately to
raise money for the
orphanage wherethey were
brought up whilst having a
run-in with the cops.
Not that much for a fast
action game if you take out
the dancing around and
music-making which is
probably why the license has
only just been snapped up!
TAYLOR
MADE
Those snappy licence bods
Krisalis have added a new
man to their recent list of
sporty signings. They've
gone and signed up Mr
England Boss, Graham
Taylor, to manage a new
football management game
- well it was hardly going to
be netball was it?
Good old Graham also
found the time from
juggling his England list
and visiting Gazza in
Hospital to help Krisalis
out with the design of the
game.
If Taylor's squeaky
clean record is anything to
go on then the game itself
should be a super-duper
example of how to manage
a top team.
Mind you, wouldn't you
do a good job is you were
being paid trillions of
spondoolies?

HOOK, LINE
AND SINKER?
Film-licence-grabbers
Ocean are hoping that their
latest signing will be more
of a high ﬂyer than one to
sink without trace, for they
have signed up Spielberg's
latest Epic, 'Hook' - the
sequel to Peter Pan.
According to the
Spielberg bible, Peter Pan
played by Robin Williams
does grow up and becomes
a Wall Street broker with
Julia Roberts (alias
Tinkerbell) a s his secretary
(once a fairy always a fairy,
I thought, er not that I
believe in them, well apart
from the tooth one that is!).
With co-stars like Dustin
Hoffman and Bob Hoskins it
can't fail to be a
blockbuster and with a bit
of Ocean magic it's bound
to ﬂy up the software
charts.
MISTAKEN
IDENTITY
Are you fed up with your
sister pulling out the plug to
your computer just as you've
reached the 30th level of
Chips Challenge, when she
thought it was her heated
rollers, or your mom pulling
the plug on the important bit
at the end of Neighbours,
when she swore blind it was
the lead to the hoover?
Well, fear not chums cos
thanks to a fabbo new idea
called the Identiplug, your
worst nightmares are over.
You just clip the plastic
casing onto the back of the
plug and Bob's Your Uncle
(aargh! Wouldn't it be just
awful if he was!), everybody
will know what device it
belongs to, e.g. computer,
video, TV, hoover,
microwave, Hi-Fi c u d d l y
toy.
The Identiplug comes in
a range of 60 titles and will
cost you 35p from most retail
outlets. Just one problem -
watch out for annoying little
sisters/brothers capable of
swapping tags!

JUST WHO ARE THE BOZOS WHO
REVIEW ALL THE GAMES?
YC likes to get the
best from its writers
and offer them
exciting perks and
goodies.
Unfortunately for
them, we keep them
so busy that they
never have time to do
anything but
reviewing. However,
just to see what
makes them tick, we
let them loose in

Jeff,
excitedly,
when he

clutching a

looking
piece of
metal and plastic "it's a Metz
ﬂash with -

lead and belt-hung Quantum

Unfortunately, a translator
wasn't on hand to tell anyone
else what he was talking
about.

Jason
returned
with a
sm0000th
haircut,
Ray-Ban
shades,
shoes so
shiny that
his grinning face was
reﬂected in them and a
gleaming white leisure suit.
Under his jacket he wore a
hawalian shirt with the top
four buttons undone and a
polished gold medallion
around his neck. After posing
for a while, he strolled away
again, followed by twenty or
so drooling girls.

back,
opening one of many

to reveal loads of Lentils,
nuts and vegetables, "Now,

bake and make a giant salad.
And it'll be, like, healthy and
natural."

R  EIALE
MANCH
UNITED
EUROPE
I
most interesting thing
Manchester United have
done all year was to
accidentally leave their kit
behind when they ﬂew off to
meet Barcelona in Holland.
Oh yes, and a bit later they
went on to win the Cup
Winners' Cup. But that wasn't
very interesting, was it now?
You think it is? (Yes! Man
Utd. fans.)
Well, Man Utd. are such
hot property now that there
was BOUND to be another
game out about them, and
who better to write this game
than the people who gave us
the original?
Krisalis claim that, out of
all the consumer reply cards
they got back from the ﬁrst in
this series, everybody wanted
a European version. So here
it is!
And what a game it is,
indeed!
It knocks the socks of the
other above-view footy
games around at the
moment, simply because of
all its highly thrilling footy
features.
For instance, to take this
month's competitors, it
makes Elite's rather
unplayable World Cup Soccer
look like a Skoda at a motor
show.
I can see some of you
Spurs/Arsenal/Liverpool
(insert your fave footy team
here) fans getting rather
narked at all these references
to Manchester United but
hang on, as the game
description unfolds, you'll
realise that it doesn't matter
which team you support...
The ﬁrst slice of the game
pie (ho, ho) is the
Management section. You'll
keep returning to this part
since it forms the core of
MUE. You can do all the
things like changing the game
time, the name of the
Manager, whether you wish
to play the arcade section or
not (of course you do!) and
choosing tactics.
Not to be confused with
Tic-Tacs which are
something completely
different. In fact, there'd be
little point in choosing small,
orange-ﬂavour sweets if you
were just off to play a game
of

international-
level football.
For this tactics selection
part, then, you get several
sliding bars. They deal with
the levels of the Goalkeeper,
Midﬁeld, Defence and Attack
for your team. By clicking on
the plus or minus signs the
level of each goes up or
down.
If you didn't like the team
formation on the 'ﬁeld', you
can cycle through the other
possible choices. That and
see which player has which
position, so you can swap
them about.
Individual players can be
ogled, with their goal tally
displayed, yellow and red
cards garnered and games
played and you can change
their names, too.
The trophies can be
checked up on; the results so
far and the full draw for the
ﬁxtures.
If you're feeling restless
for competition, you can even
play a friendly against any of
the other team willing to take
part. This takes us nicely to
•
the arcade gamey-bit proper.
This part is ﬁlled with the
kind of little touches that
just occasionally make
reviewing games
such a treat. Like
the way the player
troop on and off
the pitch and
the beginning
and end of
each half,
followed by a
(wait for it, you
may not have
seen one of these
in previous footy
games)... referee,
who toddles on with
the ball.
The players also manage
to look like they're running
and to do quite convincing
tackles. The goalie even does
a little run-up for a goal kick,
as does a player taking a free
kick (which you manage by
putting a cursor in the
general direction you want it
to go).
You can also pull off
super curved kicks, power

Here at YC we seem to be quite keen on a very nice
artist by the name of Steiner. His illustrations have now
graced two covers in a row (he did that rather nice
Extreme poster/cover last ish and the Man Utd.
cover/poster this ish).
So because we like him so much (and we hope you
do too), we've got a very good prize indeed.
You can win 10 copies of the game poster signed
by Steinar himself, personally (with only a little bit of
threatened violence from Krisalis software).
And all you need to do to win one is to answer the
following question...
What's the name of Manchester
United's home ground?
When you've worked that out, send your answer to:
"I'd rather be Red than Dead Combo", YC, 20
Potters Lane, Kiln Farm, Milton Keynes, MK11
3F1F.
Send it by the 1st of August too, or we'll be brutal and
say you can't take part. Oh,and the Editor's decision is
ﬁnal, even if it may be wrong sometimes (Just like the
ref, is he blind or what?!)

What a stormer! Wizard's Lair
is, you may recall, a rather
good game of a few years
back involving the
exploration of a large amount
of caves and rooms but, hey,
let's see what this poem (and
no, we at VC didn't write RI)
manages to tell us:
THE LEGEND OF
THE CAVE
"Tis a legend told long ago
About dark caves far
down below,
Where deep within a
Wizard dwells,
Bespaking doom and
casting spells.
If this Lair thou dost uncover,
Four pieces of lion though
must discover.
Only then may you escape
Past the lion that guards the
gate.
So heed this warning and
beware
connecting caves, rooms
and passages. His only
chance of escape is to ﬁnd
the four pieces of the
Golden Lion which are
spread over several levels
of the cave. There are many
items and strange creatures
to both help and hinder Pete
in his quest to escape.
As Pete trundles around,
there are (as well as
ghou lies, ghosties and
things that go bump in the
night) many objects to pick
up, such as bonus lives,
weapons, gold, food, drink,
rings, diamonds, spells and
many trapdoors, secret
passages, wardrobe lifts,
magic lifts and snakes
(snakes?!).
It's also huge! And there
are seven levels to map
before you even have a

SCORPION II
Programmer: Mr Leslie
Wig more
Type: Complete game -
Shoot-'em-Up
Controls: Joystick
Well, we've lost the scenario
to this (sorry Leslie!) but I'll
have a bash.
It seems that the Space
Marines used a rather fancy
space ﬁghter called The

Scorpion and that it smegs
aliens faster than a Pit Bull
terrier savages people's
arms. Furthermore, after a
trip to the Space Marines
recruiting ofﬁce and a go on
their Scorpion simulator,
you're guaranteed to sign up
to the service.
Well, after the last
Scorpion (which was set on
the simulator), you've gone
and done it - signed up, that
is. And now you're in deep
space, with many, many alien
beasties heading towards
you.
This is, you will agree,
ever-so-slightly
disadvantageous and has to
be dealt with by aggressive
action courtesy of your
futuristic spaceship.
HOW TO PLAY
It's very simple, just blast the
enemy to alien-beastie
heaven and, er, wipe them
out! Good luck!

Type: Complete game -
Shoot-'em-up
Controls: Joystick
War has broken out... of
that cage you put it in the
other day, er, no. Let's try
again.
Right, war has broken
out and you are one of the
ﬁrst pilots to get their
mission orders - to ﬂy, kill,
bomb, maim - you know the
score. To do this you've got
a rather spiffy plane that
knows where it's going.
Naturally, you have to keep
it on course as it ﬂies to the
target. You also have to
blast everything that gets in
its way and avoid getting
shot down.
But! You're not alone!
One of your friends is
coming to - in a chopper.
You can team up against
the odds to get the foe.
Hurrah!

HOW TO PLAY
Just get from one end of
the game to the other, in
the classic 1941' style - by
killing things. If your friend
joins in, plug the 'stick into
Port One. What ho and
chocks away!
JUST WHO IS
STANLEY PRECISION?
Born plain Stanley Smith,
Stanley had a dull childhood
and a really rather dull
education until, on his last
day at Cambridge University,
he was approached by a
strange man in a raincoat.
“Pssst!" said the
raincoated man.
“No I'm not!" said
Stanley, recycling a joke
from 'Up Pompeii', "I haven't
touched a lager in weeks!"
-
"I'm on Her Majesty's Secret
Service and I'd like to offer
you a job with MI5."
Stanley was
gobsmacked, he'd never
looked further aﬁeld than his
home town of Corby,
Northants, and didn't know
whether he could take a
jetsetting life in MI5.
"And you won't have to
move away from Corby,
either." said the MI5 man, as
if reading Stanley's mind.
"How come?" said
Stanley, unsure how
somewhere as dull as Corby
ﬁtted into the sparkling life
of a spy.
"Because you'll be
working in our Data Systems
department, whose
exclusive job it is to monitor,
check and replace duff
tapes from the cover of YC
magazine." replied the man.
"But... Data systems are
so dull - I'll take it!" said
Stanley.
"Read this piece of paper
and memorise it. You start
tomorrow, under the code
name 'Stanley Precision"
And the man slipped
away, on a banana skin, er,
into the night.
Stanley looked at his
instructions: "If you have a
problem with a YC tape, ask
yourself: 1, Have I checked
the Datacorder with some
other games? 2. Have I tried
adjusting the Datacorder's
heads? 3. If this fails, send
the tape to:
YC Tape 19 Returns,
Stanley Precision Data
Systems,
Unit F, Cavendish
Courtyard,
Sallow Road,
Weldon North Industrial
Estate,
Corby,
Northants,
NN17 1JX.
Now destroy these
instructions..."

EUGENE'S
SCUM OF THE
EARTH
There I was sitting in the mega-luxurious
VC ofﬁces the other day, happily
munching away at my "Fig 'n Fibre
healthy stool" bar, when the door was
blown off and in stormed Mr Eugene
himself.
"SCUM!" he bellowed whilst he kicked
me to the ground. "If I see any similar
tips coming in again this month then
you're for it!"
"P-p-p-please Mr Eugene, sir, what do
you mean?" I stammered in a pathetic
way.
"I'm not stupid! I do know what other
64 magazines publish! Only original tips
shall be rewarded, ripped-off ones shall
be punished!"
"B-b-b-but Mr Eugene
But he had gone.
Frightened staff crawled out from
underneath various pieces of furniture,
apart from a chuckling Mr Henderson
who was sat at his desk calmly eating
his sandwiches.
"I think," he said, "people shouldn't
nick tips from other magazines and send
them to you"
"Oh" I said, and carried on with my ﬁg
bar.

POKES
Right people, a large
number of you have been
writing in requesting
instructions on how to use
a "poke" and "sys"
number. Lets clear this up
once and for all.
Here we enlist the help
of YCs very own
'programmer-on-a-string'
Richard Taylor
"A poke statement
quite simply alters part of
the computers memory
and changes the way a
program runs. The areas
usually affected are the
parts that control the
number of lives remaining,
collision detection or time,
etc.
To enter a poke, you
are going to need to reset
your computer somehow.
If you have a reset switch,
then you are a very lucky
person. Simply press this
and your computer will
" r e
its memory.
If you don't have one,
then unless the
instructions otherwise
specify you will be unable
to enter the pokes.
If you really want a
reset switch and can
afford a cartridge (25 quid,
ish) then recommended
ones are 'Action Replay'
and the iExpert'. These will
both allow you to reset
most games.
When the computer is
reset, type the the POKE
number, or numbers,
followed each time by
Return. When they are
entered, type in the SYS
number also, followed by
Return. The game should
now run again and the
cheat will be operative.
If there is no SYS
number then that means
the cheat is speciﬁcally for
cartridge resets only,
where the game can be
continued by other means.
There are actually
cheaper ways to reset
your computer, i.e. if you
know the old "paper clip"
trick, but this isn't
recommened unless you
know exactly what you are
doing.
Some switches can go
in the serial port as well,
but games usually need a
more powerful cartridge
reset."
Thanks, Richard.

FORGOTTEN WORLDS
These tips come from David Bennett in the Orkney
Islands.
To kill the dust dragonwait until its arm is away from
its pounding heart. Fly directly over the heart and shoot
downwards. Repeating this will ﬁnish him off.
In the caverns to destroy the gun placements, pause
the game when thay appear and press CTRL +
COMMODORE KEY + BACKARROW. They should vanish
after a short while and this can be done until the level is
complete.
Apparently the safest place to be is in the top left
corner ish.
Cheers David, a ﬁver is on it's way.
And ﬁnally, here are some
passwords from our very
own Richard Taylor for the
puzzler The Power
(reviewed elsewhere in this
issue). Cheers Richard, but
if you think you're getting a
crispy tenner for this, hard
luck! Ha ha! I can be so

For the past few months, Paul "Stop the
Press" Rigby has been poring over man y
strange magazines which he kept
hiding wh en  w e  c a me  near.
No w  we  kn o w what he
wa s  reading (so he
claims!).
A
the regular fanzine
section - which isn't.
This month: Why carrots
compliment any potato dish,
the problem with broccoli
and.. .drat, they're my
cookery notes.
Let's see: fun with fungus,
fondling with conﬁdence,
ﬁssion for beginners,
fanzi..ah, here we are.
This month we'll be taking
a look at some of the latest
adventure fanzine issues
covered in the past issues of
VC. "How's things?" we
exclaim to their respective
Editors. "Go away!" they
reply. See the pretty little
boxes elsewhere.
In the meantime let's
continue with the chat aimed
towards prospective editors
of the world's greatest
fanzine (the one you will
write, that is).
Advertising: A necessary
evil. However, it can provide
a welcome shot in the bank
balance and can give your
fanzine a more respectable
image.
After talking to various
fanzine editors, it seems
ideas for advertising should
really begin at home.
For example, it is
advisable to look towards
local computer shops for
either advertising or support
and sponsorship. Ready cash
is not
always the most
favourite form of
payment by shops so maybe
they can provide you with
free games or posters (which
you can use as competition
prizes) in return for
advertising.
The retailers may even
agree to
sell your
fanzine.
But if your magazine is
intended to be nationwide, it
may be more advisable to
head for the mail-order
outlets who would appreciate
the country-wide distribution
that your mag can provide.
The local retailers and
national mail-order outﬁts are
probably the people you want
to head for before you
approach the software
houses.
Mainly
because, when you do
approach a software house,
they will be able to see that
you have made a
commitment, have attracted
several advertisers already
and, therefore, are more
attractive than the person
who turns up with a fanzine
containing no adverts at all.
A form of reference from
one, or more, advertisers is
also handy to have.
Something declaring that
their shop has been
advertising with your fanzine
for "x" amount of months and
has increased sales by "x°/0"
ADVENTURE
PROBE
The latest issue of Probe (the May issue
at the time of writing) contains the usual
variety of reviews, features, hints & tips,
letters and other, nameless, stuff.
Speciﬁcally, there are reviews for both
16-bit and 8-bit computers, a short piece
by well-known independent adventure
author, Tom Frost, about where the ideas
for adventures come from, some news, a
few cries for help, hints, a short story,
objects encountered in an adventure and
what they're used for and...by 'eck! An

Adventure Coder is the magazine for all
adventure authors (new, old, and
prospective). It contains sections on
individual adventure utilities and more
general languages, articles on
adventures, themes for adventure
plots, design, structure and so on.
Since we last encountered Coder,
the mag has split into two. Now, the 8-

magazine of their own. Both magazines
appear bi-monthly (so there is a Coder,
in some form, available every month).

Sweeten them up by
sending them a regular copy

and chat about the 'zine, get

ten ways to kill small

1. In a blender.
2. With an axe.
3. In the microwave.
4. Get them to eat a piece of
poisoned cheese.
5. Slice the top off their heads.
6. Smother their bodies in
honey and watch them eat
themselves.
7. Stick a ﬁrework up their
bottoms and light it.
8. Eat them.
9. Shoot them.

10. In a washing machine.
(Do not try any of these at

by a qualiﬁed genetic

MORE,
MORE,
MORE
I have writte n this le tte r
to give you YC guys a fe w
Ideas, because I have
thought tha t instead of
getting be tte r it has got
worse. You have hardly
had any reviews on
games recently, a nd in
your last mag you only
had seven! Please put
more reviews in.
Here are my ideas:
1. Have a fe w more
pages of tips and cheats.
2. Have more  pages in
the magazine.
3. P ut more
PLAYABLE DE MO S  on the
cassette.
4. Have more  compos.
5. Have more  games
on the  cassette. On the
speccy mags they ge t
two cassettes and te n
games.
Please could you do
these or else!
Print this le tte r or
else!
Give me le tte r of da
munf or else!
Thomas Bowe n,
No
PA: Listen mate, if more
games actually came out
we'd review them. We can't
help it that sometimes in
the year the software
companies are as proliﬁc
as a stamp sticking agency
that's run by a team of
mutes without tongues.
As for more
games/demos on the
cassette, we (and the
speccy mags) are now
bound by ELSPA (a bunch
of interfering oldsters in
grey suits) to only run two
full games on the tape,
otherwise they'll come
round and shove our
favourite teddies up our
bottoms. Oh, and by the
way here are my demands:
1. Stop threatening me!
2. Or else!
THE LAST
WINGER
I've just started reading the
mag after becoming
disgusted with others that
diversify to the point of
nearly covering the whole
damn industry.
Actually, I didn't realise
how good it is. I especially
like the 'style' of writing
seen in most of the reviews
from the Feb '91 issue (we
get it THAT late here!),
especially Rik Henderson
and Duncan Evans. They
manage to inject that
sarcastic type of humour I
like so much.
At this stage I must
digress and ask gaming
questions. One that has
made my copy of Last Ninja
2 a waste is this I  clear the
ﬁrst level then can't ﬁnd
out how to exit to level 2.
Help! I wrote to System 3
and they were rude enough
to totally ignore me.
Paul's adventure section
is quite good by the way.
There is one other thing,
what about the console?
I've got an IBM compatible
and have had a C64 for
years as the games are
much cheaper (as I'm more
discerning), but the
console, is it an upgrade or
new product completely?
Please give me help and
I will be very grateful.
Supporting your prodigious
publication would be the
least I could do.
Brian Reid,
Penrith, Australia
1111E 41-1- E B S
PA: Just when you think
you've got reviewers you
like they up and bugger off!
Mind you, you've still got
the incredibly sarcastic wit
of our Jeff, why only the
other day he said to me
"isn't it a lovely day!", and it
wasn't - what a guy? (0i!
Ed)
By the way, do I look like
Oozin' Eugene? And if you
still think I do, Australia's
not too far away for me to
come over and rip both your
legs off you know! Mind
you, I think you should send
System 3 a jolly rotten letter
explaining how you feel (I'd
just send them my
grandmother myself - after
all, she is dead and smells a
bit).
The console, it's erm...
a C64 with slot really!
Sorry if that disappointed
you.

LIMBS OF SATAN
(AARRGGHH!!)
I would like to wish Rik all the best in his new job
with that Amiga (spit) magazine.
Right, now onto some questions:
1. Why are Domark wanting such a high price for the 3D
Construction Kit?
2. Is Chase HO any good or what?
3. When are you going to shoot that baby?
1,000,000. Have you heard about Orkney and its apparent satanic rituals? If
so, It's all lies.
Right, I'm off to feed the goat and light the Ox blood candles, Satan's coming
round for tea.
PS. Only joking!
PPS. Or am I?
PPPS. Bring back Vic Reeves on telly!
PPPPS. Wha t does PS stand for?
PPPPPS. My hand has got writer's cramp!
David Bennett, Orkney Islands
PA: Here's a few answers:
1. Because it allows you to build tall buildings?
2. Or what!
3. The baby got bored after a while and has gone off to be a star. Have you seen
Mirrorsoft's Brat?
1,000,000 I have as it goes, and my half brother's actually up there at the moment
checking you all out.
By the way, PS probably stands for Post Satanism where you come from,

Director. So here they are

of Computer Botfol"
THE CONTESTANTS:
David Darling
(Codemasters):
The Oodles are many
people's budget faves and
the Darlings got loads of
publicity by being computer
''whizzkids" with fast cars
and big cash a few years
back. David is one of the
famous Darling brothers
(along with bra Richard).
Mark Strachan and
Dominic Wheatley
(Domark):
Another duo, these two have
been in the business for
years and years with their
cuddly company Domark.
They seem to enjoy dressing
up, especially for wacky
(often Bond-related) press
photos and they've managed
a consistent stream of
playable software over the
years.
Bernard Dugdale (Elite):
He*s actually the Sales (and
Marketing) Director but is
standing in for Elite's MD. He
says that if he wins... "I'll
spend a couple of hours in
the garden with my lilies and

If you're a fan of Northside, you'd

shove a poster up on your wall (next
to all the rather corking ones YC's

So pick up your crayons and write

stormed and burnt to the ground and
their family shot by several thousand angry
people on horses (Surely you mean "will win a copy of Infogrames excellent Civil

Pioneer 10 passed Jupiter,
left the solar system, and
went deep into space
carrying a plaque showing
terrestrial beings (That's us,
folks!). Now it is 3021 (Gosh,
how time ﬂies!) and Pioneer
has returned - along with
space pirates who have
disabled the craft, resulting
in possible destruction for
the Earth. Your task is to
locate the ship's computer
and avoid being splattered
into the universe along with
the rest of the Earth's
population when the ship
explodes.
So it's "humanoid to the
rescue". Yes! You have an
upper half of your body like
Arnold Schwarzenegger, and
a bottom half like 112D2. So
you should take your WD40
with you to keep you on the
move!
Well, are we all oiled up
and ready to go (00-erl) and
become a hero? Extreme is
based on the idea of a
humanoid therefore the
game is half blast-em-up and
puzzle (majority blast,
hurrah!) with no messing
around.
Extreme is based on
three missions/levels. These
missions include retrieving
energy crystals and
swimming through fuel
tanks.
In level one you are in the
centre of an acid bath, (not
to be confused with an acid
party totally out of your
brains going bonkers!).
The ﬁrst level involves
you 'n' your outrageous gun
blowing nasties to
smithereens whilst collecting
all the essential objects (a
little crystal) that will take
you on to ﬁght another day.
You regain your legs
when you advance to level
two "underwater". But
don't panic, you won't rust,
you just swim about, ﬁnding
objects and zap-arising
everything that gets in your
way plus solving puzzles.
If this wasn't strange
enough with legs one second
and not the next, the
humanoid spends the last
level scrambling over rough
terrain with lasers being ﬁred
from all angles!
Extreme is an, er,
extreme-ly (Boo! We've had
that joke before! Ed)
addictive game wich will
have you somewhatstuck to
your chair. Unlike the
humanoid and its robot legs,
it's not half a game!
The OK graphics (for a
Commie), along with the
slightly dull sonics take
nothing away from the
brilliant gameplay. which
makes Extreme well worth a
look.
So don't delay, go
and spend your dosh!

REVIEWS
GAME - BOUNTY HUNTER
[DISK 6]
PRICE - £2.95 (DISK];
E2.50 [TAPE]. UK POST
FREE
ELSEWHERE ADD £1.00
Bounty Hunter is the latest
Rip-Roaring-River game to hit
the Commie. Wrapped up in
125 locations complete with a
map, documentation and a
hint sheet.
The game deals with that
well known sexually
transmitted disease - Viroids.
Well, actually they (yes, they)
are neuro-viral lifeforms. But
you guessed that already
dintya?
The ﬁrst experimental
batch of 22 specimens was
on the way to HQ (to
compete in the Mars versus
Pluto inter-planetary footie
match) when the ship
carrying the cargo threw a
wobbler and crashed (blood

everywhere) on the planet of
Karakata.
The Federation can
remember Karakata as a
quite yucky uninhabited
place, unﬁt for human
habitation - then it was
renamed Milton Keynes (no,
heh, no, really, heh, but
seriously, but seriously, my
mother-in-law - my mother-
in-law is so fat, she's
so..thump.)
Sorry, that was an
unwelcome intrusion by the
Phantom Club Comedian.
Back to the plot, Michael.
Colonists once staffed the
deserted buildings but they
are now under the rule of the
planet's natural elements.
Add the fact that Karakata
lies rather too close
to some enemy
strongholds and you
can
guess
why
this
planet
has
never been
re-colonised.
That, and the
overwhelming smell of
unwashed feet.. .but that's
another story.
However, while the
Federation cannot risk a
direct confrontation by
'
landing on the planets and
looking for the Viroids they
cannot, at the same time, be
allowed to fall into enemy
hands. They weigh an
absolute ton, for one thing -
probably resulting in many
sprained wrists, and
contusions (bless you).
This is where you, the
mercenary, come in (yes..no,
yes, really, aye madam, let
me tellya, I knew a mercenary
- he was s0000 fat this
mercenary...s000 fat
that...thump, crack) Sorry,
Phantom Club Comedian
again - ahem.
Your mission is to seek
and destroy the 22 escaped
virolds.
Bounty Hunter,
which loads
quickly via the
Freeze Machine
load sequence,
uses fairly
short
location
4 2 0
descriptions written with
yellow text on a black screen
- probably the best colour-
coded combination. There is
also a score routine telling
you how many Virolds you
have killed.
It is a shame that it

P 1:1 
S
doesn't have the wiz-bang
Spectrum-version feature of
1 500 locations. But then, who
needs em, eh?
Most of those locations
were not really locations
anyway. Nothing happened in
them. The essential story-
linked locations (the active
locations, that is) are still
intact in the Commie version.
Puzzle quality is pretty
nifty. Odd, seemingly
meaningless objects will
require lateral thinking if you
are decipher what is required
in a speciﬁc location.
Bounty Hunter is low on
gloss but high on sheer
design quality. It may look
like an old fashioned
adventure with no gimmicks
to keep you gasping but the
gameplay makes you quickly
forget such nonsense.
Recommended.

GAME - DOMES OF SHA ;
MISER ; JACK & THE
BEANSTALK (DISK 41
PRICE - £4.50 [DISK].
DOMES OF SHA AND
MISER (TAPE] E2.50
JACK & THE BEANSTALK
(WITH THE CHALLENGE)
£2.50.
Disk Four (so what happened
to the other three? Don't look
at me I haven't got them) in
River's box of goodies gives
you excellent value for your
dosh with three
adventures.
Domes of Sha is set
on the planet
Olaxas, a war-
ravaged land. It
tells the tale of
the Sha tribe (so
called because of
the impatient
historian who
was in too
much of a
damned hurry
to completely
hear what
the full
name of
this
gentle
people
actually
were. He
only
caught the
ﬁrst three letters)
who, apparently,
have waited some time
for your arrival.
Six domes encircle
the valley. Your job is to
ﬁnd the secret of them. You
set out to release the tribe
from the Cold Fear (that
prevents them from leaving
the valley), together with
Grunt y o u r  faithful semi-
intelligent man-type thing,
person, ape-ish creature
chapple.
Domes features many
awkward map-making
sessions with the inclusion of
many UP and DOWN
directions competing with IN
and OUT which, added to the
usual directions, makes for a
messy map if you're not
careful.
Domes of Sha is well-
designed and simply
presented with a very good
puzzle quality and plot. The
inclusion of Grunt, for
example, makes for a
different set of puzzle-
types as you must
interact with this
non-player
character to
uncover
objects or
get past
obstacles.
Next
on the list
is Miser
a
festive
adventure -
there's timing
for you, eh? A
Scrooge story, in
fact. [Screwed?
screwed? There was
this girl, see, this girl,
right, nudge, nudge, down
the pub, down the pub. 'N I
said, I said, scuse me, what's
a nice girl like you
doin'...thump, crack, garrote]
Sorry, Phantom Club
Comedian, again, and that
was Scrooge, bub, Scrooge.
Any road up, after a visit by
the usual ghostly apparitions
you will need to complete 12
good deeds to complete this
adventure.
Half the job is to ﬁnd
exactly what good deeds are
that you need to undertake.
This is done by talking to
different people. With black
text on a grey background
Miser is an engaging game
which will bafﬂe many an
adventurer. Miser is not
exactly tough. Just tricky.
Finally, Jack & the
Beanstalk follows the classic
fairy story. Basically, you
must ﬁnd the golden egg and
bring it home to mum. Ithas a

"Penguins, yes, penguins. What relevance do penguins have on the furtherance of
medical science? Well, strangely enough quite a lot, a major breakthrough, maybe. It
was from such an unlikely beginning as an unwanted fungus accidentally growing on
a sterile plate that Sir Alexander Fleming gave the world penicillin. Would Albert
Einstein ever have hit upon the theory of relativity if he hadn't been so clever? Would
Rutherford ever have split the atom if he hadn't tried? Could Marconi have invented
the radio if he hadn't by pure chance spent years working on the problem?
Nevertheless scientists believe that these penguins, these comic ﬂightless, web-
footed little bastards may ﬁnally unwittingly help man to fathom the uncharted depths
of the human mind."

h a t  can I say about
World
Championship
Soccer by Elite? There I
was, pondering with the
joystick, ready to
tackle this
footy
T h ere w a s  a t ime w h e n  J a s o n
M i l l e r could b e  seen  o n  th e
t e rra c e s  at Real M a d ri d ,  s o  with
Rik b u sy at YA, w e  g a v e  h im t h e
title of "Footle exp ert"  f o r the issue
and h a n d e d  h im Elite's latest...
simulation, when I realised
the amazing amount of footy
games that are around
today. We have a fair old
few to choose from these
days, since
Gascoigne's
tears put
soccer
•  
•

top last year.
The sound of the words
"World Championship
Soccer" take me back to the
World Cup last summer; The
Cameroons with their beat-
'em-up tactics, and plump
Maradonna with his hand
that scored more times than
the rest of the Argies put
together.
But what are Elite doing?!
Every soccer tan knows that
footy season is over, it's tim
for strawberries and cream
for the tennis, or maybe those
Italian spaghetti-eaters want •
to rub our faces in the ground
after beating us (England), 2
back /  1 in the World Cup in Italy.
at N o !  Neither the Italians or
Lazio on crutches than this
game is at being a great footy
sim.
Sega had a highly
successful and popular
arcade soccer game, which
has now been brought to
home computers by Elite
Systems. Well, Sega may
have been highly successful
but Elite will put an end to
that quite soon!.
Now to the serious
business, a chance to be
like your heroes, Lineker,
Mattaus etc.
-
24 international teams and -
yes! - even the chance to 1111.
select the eleven players for
your team. Fierce
the.„
about "World Championship e n o u g h  to make you quiver
Soccer.
Please bear with me on
this one, don't think "why the,
hell is he talking a load of
baloney", as when you play
"W.C.S." you will not be
talking baloney - but playing
it. Sorry Elite, but they do say
the truth hurts. Lets face it,
Paul Gascoigne would be
more successful playing for '•
in your studded boots. A
chance to see if you have
what it takes to steal the cup
from the holders.
This by no means is an
easy task since you have to
qualify before you're allowed .
to play against the giants of
4.football. Once you have
-1
selected the team you wish to
play, make a note of their
numerical qualiﬁcations, one
to ﬁve, ﬁve being the best.
The U.S.S.R. seem without a
doubt the team to be
reckoned with, as skill,
speed, defence and their
keeper are all above four!
The 'member select'
screen will give you a run-
down of your players and
their abilities. Look at the
statistics before you choose
your team as these give you
the player's capability, and
their numerical value in
comparison with their other
team-mates. Team selection
is a major factor if the cup is
to be on the plane home with
you,
Once the team is chosen,
you'll have a chance for a
practice or put yourself in at
the deep end. you'll be
amongst one of the six
groups, each group
containing four members
just like the real World Cup.

Only the ﬁrst and
second-placed teams from
each group will qualify for
the ﬁnal tournament, this is
'worked out on the principals
of the best goal difference,
amount of goals scored and
the quickest goal!. So It's a

scores are tied it's extra
time then penalties. "This
game sounds like te real
thing!", I hear you cry. Yes it
does. The principals are the
same and the ideas are ﬁne,
unfortunately, the playing
and errors let the game fall.
Your man can dribble
with the ball, tackle and
even (that dreaded word)
foul and get sent off, difﬁcult
but true.
What's wrong? Oh well,
basically, no offsides, the
teams play in yellow or blue
(two colours! The designers
of footy strips will be
unemployed!). The goalie is
alhght, but quite often the
player can shoot the ball
through him if he follows up
the shot, and even foul
throws are allowed (B0000!
Ed).
It's up to you to decide
whether to buy this game or
not! But personally I would
rather spend my
money more wisely
(hint, hint!).
Elite had more balls to produce this dross
than FIFA used in the whole World Cup.

 oohh, another arcade
puzzle! Two good
ones this month!
This is supposed to have
something to do with that
awful "Snap" song. Where is
the music, though? Instead of
the title song it plays old MC
Hammer's "You can't touch
this". Very strange.
POWER
•  
•
Before I saw this I
thought it was going to be a
classic case of cashing- in,
using the song to sell the
game. It really isn't though,
so even if you really hated the
song don't be put off. It really
has nothing to do with it.
You take the part of a little
ball called Max, whose aim in
life is to zoom around
collecting hearts to give to
the love of his life, Mini.
He does this with your
assistance, of course.
You must point your
pointer at Max and hold ﬁre
down. Pulling the joystick in
various directions will display
a small arrow and releasing
ﬁre will hurl Max in that
direction. Max can only stop
now if something other than a
heart blocks his path.
Also lying around are
movable coloured blocks that
are essential to some
screens. Be careful when
moving them because some
of them destroy other
coloured blocks.
Once you have collected
all of the hearts you have to
get to Mini to reach the next
level.
It doesn't really sound all
that much, but most of the
screens are ﬁendishly difﬁcult
and require quite a lot of
thought.
'The presentation
throughout is really quite
superb, there are plenty of
options on the title screen,
including an "arcade' and
"tactic" selection. The arcade
has larger graphics, each
character being four blocks
GE111
" Di a mo n d s  a re  forever" s a n g
Shirley Bassey. Well t h ey w e re
until R i c h a r d  T a y l o r started
smash in g  t h e m u p  in this puzzler.
T
original puzzle game
that will frustrate,
annoy and totally absorb you
for a fair old while.
The idea behind it all is
brilliantly simple. You have
two screens divided vertically
with gems set out in various
patterns. The left screen is
the one you inﬂuence with
your joystick, and the right
one is set up by the
computer.
The idea is to replicate
the 'computer' screen by
changing the colour and
position of your gems.
The gems come in ﬁve
colours: red, green, blue, pink
and gold. To change the
colour, you point your
"prodder" at the relevant gem
and press ﬁre. The gem and
all surrounding ones, apart
from diagonals, will cycle
through the colours. Sadly
though, when the gems reach
gold and are changed again,
they decide that they've had
enough and off they go.
This results in all gems
above that one falling down.
This has to be done
sometimes though!
Once the computer
screen is matched, that task
is ﬁnished and off you go to
the next one. There are 400
levels in total so it will take
some time to complete the
game!
The levels are split into
six separate screens, and
when a level is ﬁnished you
are presented with a grid in
Red LED fashion. You can
pick the next block to move
onto, and work your way
across the grid until the other
side is reached.
I haven't yet been able to
do this after a week of fairly
heavy playing, so it may take
some time!
After each level, you get a

picture of a wide-eyed young
lady barely dressed, looking
rather shocked! This seems
to be some incentive to
complete the grid, as each
picture is, errr, more
revealing than the last! What
a great idea! Haha! (I don't
think!)
The graphics are really
nice and colourful, though
some of the gems look like
those glacier fruit sweets.
The sound is also really
good with funky music and
chunky jingles through out.
I Played the Amiga
version of this game before
the 64 one and I didn't think
much of it, so I reckoned that
this would be pretty bad.
Surprisingly, though, I
really enjoyed it! I found it
somehow easier to play.
Its a very well presented,
incredibly challenging puzzle
game that really will make
you come back for more.
If you want to buy a
puzzle this month and it's
either this or The Power,
then I'd recommend this
one. Its idea is more original
and I'm sure it has a
slight edge on
gameplay.

Like a squirrel with  2 0 0 0  volts fed
through it, J a s o n  M i l l e r  has the
p o w e r so h e c h a rg e d  straight
t o w a rd s  this compilation...
A
compilation_ This time
it's Ocean's turn with a
crop of arcade conversions.
Let's go!
CHASE H.Q.
The chase is on and the
tarmac is giving off heat as
your turbo-charged Porsche
928 scorches down the
highway. The sound of
screeching tyres echoes
through the city as yet
another crime is committed.
You're special criminal
investigators in LA with a
mission to prevent crime, so
after receiving your
instructions from Nancy at
HQ, you have to complete
ﬁve missions, such as
apprehending those ﬁendish
cocaine pushers! All you have
to do is ram - yes, ram! - your
Porsche into the back of the
offenders in question. And it's
not easy at 215mph!
Do the words spiffy and
zany ring a bell? Well, I hate
to disappoint you, but of all
the car simulations around,
this is by far the worst I've
seen. So rry to say, but there
are no words bad enough to
describe the graphics and
sonics of this game, and its
speed is laughable - it's so
slow! Ayrton Senna would not
give this game a second look.
TURRICAN
Help! Its another one of those
'blast-em-up and become a
hero' days. Why go to all this
trouble? If you are into beat-
'em-ups or blasting the living
daylights out of things, just
go straight down to your local
pub (Er... I don't think so! Ed)
No, don't actually, try
Turrican instead, where
people dare not set foot on
the streets at night; Where
grannies cannot go out and
gossip with their friends. And
all because of Morgul_
Turrican is the only bod
who can destroy Morgul and
his kingdom, the objective is
- naturally - to guide your
hero through ﬁve worlds
where he will encounter many
perils. You must blast
everything that gets in your
way with improvable and
mega weaponry. Now go and
zap the varmints!
ALTERED
BEAST
A rather different beat-em-up
action game, this one, as you
have supernatural powers
beyond belief. Zeus (some
major Greek god-type) has
picked you to save his
daughter Athena (I thought
she was a poster shop? Ed)
from the clutches of the Nelf-
slimeballs from the
underworld. By collecting
mystical spirit balls you
become a strongman with a
punch that Mike Tyson would
be proud of. You can even
become a Werewolf or
Weretiger.
RAINBOW
ISLAND
"Oh Geoffrey, Bungle, and
George, what do we have
here?!" "Put a sock in it Zippy
and be quiet, or I will have to
shut you up". Don't worry,
Rainbow Island has nothing
to do with an overgrown
moth ball creature and
everyone's fave TV
programme, it is Bub and
Bob from Bubble Bobble up
against the hazards of the
1JP
rainbow islands
There are myriad
creatures who will impede
your progress on every level
up until that very moment
when you face up to the
"Guardian" (What, the
newspaper? Ed). Master the
art of the rainbow (what is
this?A new martial art?) kill
the enemies with it. No joke!

it is supremely addictive and

Beach Head, Beach Head 2
and Raid are all essentially
action games of remarkably
similar format. First there's
the stategic bit which in
Beach Head involves
deciding wheather to
navigate ships through a
mineﬁeld or face a sea battle
straight away, in Raid
involves deciding how many
planes to launch on the
chosen Russian City and in
Beach Head 2 the strategist
must choose between"
Aftack","Rescue","Escape"
and "Battle". Then comes the
meaty ﬁghting, ass-kicking,
gun-swinging, battle bits, on
land, or sea. The strategic
parts leave a lot to be
desired, being more irritating
than challenging (although
the aeroplane launch in the
semi-weightless conditions
of Raid's scenario is more
original than the mineﬁeld
navigation in Beach Head 2)
The graphics are
reasonable to good, perhaps
the coolest feature is the little
man in Raid who mutters
through a distortion box "You
can't kill me" (or some such
thing).
Raid was the best of
these three. It held the
attention and was, on the
whole, more gripping than
fatiguing. The logic that 3
games of such a similar
format will sell better than
one is probably valid. For
£4.99 it's OK, and it is
deﬁnitely the case that if
onegame appeals, the others
will too.

So the screen goes to a
mass of stars, with your

is from your starbase that you

The ships can then leap
from star to star (you're

three things a turn), fortifying
them, mining them, mining

E2.99
During an electrical storm
one night, young Jim Bond's
plums were struck by
lightning. Since then,
adventure has never been
far away, etc.
In this daring adventure
you, as 007, have to ﬁnd
and destroy the evil drug
smuggler Sanchez
somewhere in Miami bay.
For the ﬁrst part you ﬂy
in a helicopter, chasing Mr
Sanchez in his rather fast
and expensive car through
Cray Key, This is set out in
Xevious style, with a top
view of the action. You can
speed the helicopter up at
the expense of ﬂying lower,
quite dangerous really,
given that there are plenty
of tall buildings knocking
around. There are plenty of
gun emplacements to take
out along the way, too!
In the second part you
land and jump out of your
chopper in an attempt to run
after Mr Sanchez and tell
him what a bad boy he's
been. This is a sort-of
'commando'-type section
with loads of his lackies
running around trying to
shoot you.
The third part ﬁnds Bond
trying to snare Sanchez's
plane, dangling on a rope
from the helicopter.
If this is completed then
scene two begins,
containing another three
separate parts.
If you manage to get
through this, destroying the
drug factory in the process,
then Sanchez somehow
escapes again and must be
chased in his reaches the
border.
In all, a fairly large and
and entertaining game
containing quite a few
different sequences, all of
which are quite playable
and reasonably tough.
The graphics are good
throughout with some very
nice ones in places whilst
the sound ﬁts nicely and
adds to what is really a
good-value-for-money
game.

SDI; Sticky doughnut icing?
Sunny day innit? No, SDI
stands for Strategic Defence
Initiative, and that's exactly
what you have to do in this
coin-op conversion.
Once again planet Earth
is under attack but this time
from itself. Nuclear missiles
have been launched and it is
your job to blow them out of
the sky.
In the ﬁrst part you have
to ﬂoat around space,
aiming your laser sight at
these objects of terror and
blasting them away. Bonus
points and weapons can be
gained by hitting satellites
and picking up pods
released from them.
In the second part, you
must defend the Earth as
missiles rain down from the
sky.
In between levels, you
dock with a shuttle and your
slats for that level are
displayed.
Quite a good game,
really. A harmless blast-'em-
up with a fun two-player
Option into the bargain. The
graphics are quite nice and
the sound blends nicely.
Well worth a look if this
game-type is your thing.

GAY LINEKER
HOT SHOT
KIXX E2.99
It seems to me that the
more famous the person
that endores something the
worse it is, Jerry Hall and a
certain stock drink are a
case in point (Jerry Hall
looks great, but Bovril
tastes, well, like it always
did). Indeed if Bovril spent
as much improving the
taste of the drink as they do
on people to convince you
it's good. I might buy it.
Which is all very
irrelevant until you consider
Gary Lineker's Hot Shot, an
aerial-view footy game
which leaves a fair amount
to be desired. The sprite
players look like spiders,
and its difﬁcult to tell the
teams apart. There are
some redeening features,
the sliding tackles are cool,
and a degree of realisim is
added by throw-ins,
corners, power-related
kicks, even fouls.
There is no doubt a
market for such a game,
fuelled by England's last
World cup, and with the
name of Gary Lineker,
shops have probably
shifted cratefuls, but then
over the years they've
shifted anything and
everything, even slimy
green sewer dwelling
mutated turtles obsessed
with pizza. If you want a
classy footy game deﬁnitely
look elsewhere!.

NAME: Skull & Crossbones.
SUPPLIER: Domark.
PRICE: E10.99 tape, £14.99 Disk.
RELEASE DATE: Out now.
On the whole, a pretty
sad conversion of a really
good fun arcade game.
Surely a better one could
have been produced, It
appears to have been a rush
job without much effort in
the design department.
Even at budget price this
wouldn't stand out and at
eleven quid I really
can't recommend
this to anyone.
Poor throughout, it could have been much
better. On the whole, rubbish.

Golf has never particularly
inspired me. I once had a job
As a caddy, I've occasionally
seen highlights on
Grandstand through half
closed eyes after Sunday
lunch, but I never had the
energy or the money to play
it.
Why is it, then, that the 3
game pack of Leader Board,
Leader Board Tournament,
and World Class Leader
Board hold me so tranced?
Is it the clear, uncluttered
graphics and layout? Is it the
skill involved in combatting
the factors of wind, snap
and the slope of the green?
Or is it simply the thought of
playing golf using only the
energy needed to move the
joystick? Whatever the
reason, this is sport
simulation at its best.
The whole screen is
functional, and the operation
simplistic, yet it maintains
the essence of golf. The
power reaching a peak then
decaying comparable to the
club swinging towards and
then away from the ball. The
golf package undersells
itself by claiming to be 3
games, it is a
comprehensive golf
simulation with a fair variety
of holes, and obstacles such
as bunkers trees and water.
There are two player
games, or you can play
against par. This time (in
contrast to Beach Head,
Beach Head 2 and Raid) the
Multimixx from Kixx really
works.

album-length slice of their
manic Forest dance/rock/pop,
packed with the singles you
know already and the sort of
excellent stuff you'll only have
heard if you've seen one of
their manic live shows (strobe
lights, keyboard-smashing and
much hard groovin'
guaranteed). This is certainly
one of the top pop albums of
1991.

CANDY SKINS
- You are Here
Oxford has spawned some
real talent over the last few
years, what with Ride and the
like. Now it's the turn of the
Candy Skins to take the
limelight. They've got plenty of
no-nonsense guitary songs,
like The Stone Roses or even
60's bands such as The
Monkees. They've signed
some Large Cash deal with
Geffen records in America so
expect to hear a lot more of
them soon. In the meantime, if
you're a laid-back sort, check
this out.

VAMPIRE'S
KISS
20 20 Vision
(Certiﬁcate '18')
Stars: Nicolas Cage,
Jennifer Beals, Maria
Conchita Alonso
This is not, in any way, at all,
a horror movie! It may sound
like one. It may even sound
like one of those black and
white masterpieces you see
on a Friday night on BBC2
with Peter Cushing and
Vincent Price, but it has
nothing to do with a) sinister
looking fellows in black
sheets, and b) snogging
round the back of the bike
sheds.
It is, in fact, a trip into the
mind of city gent Peter Loew
(superbly played by Cage),
and a look into obsession,
namely his with a girl who he
thinks is a vampire. She
(Jennifer Beals) is picked up
by him one night in a bar
and during the naughty bits
(this isn't really a family
movie) she bites his neck,
drawing blood and sending
him - and us viewers - into a
one way trip in which we are
never sure whether she
really is just a kinky New
Yorker, or a bride of Dracula.
After a time he gradually
faces the fact that he has
fumed into one of the
undead, and starts to act as
so, and although his
character has never been a
particularly nice one (the
way he treats his secretary
(Maria Conchita Alonso) is
tragic), as an audience we
feel more and more sorry for
the man, mainly thanks to
Cage's completely
compelling and
compassionate
performance.
Vampire's Kiss should be
billed in the same way as
Cronenberg's Dead Ringers,
and is a black comedy that
revolves around the slow
and painful dissolving of one
man's sanity. It is an abuse
of all of your senses, and if
you really don't mind your
own small quirks being
exposed it's well worth
every penny of your rental
fee.

You remember Deadline
don't you? Tank Girl? You
know, that incredibly trendy
comic that all the fashion
victims of this world (and
B I G  T H R I L L S  B I G  T H R I L
those that appreciate good
comics) have on standing
order from their newsies!
Well, so incredible is its
power that another
'Mature(ish) Reader' monthly
comic hits the shelves of the
paper shops up and down
the country, and the question
that hangs in the air is: is it as
pretentious as the rest of the
feeble efforts?
Its answer, when
confronted by this, would
most likely be “Moi?", its
roots lie in comic fandom, but
its head is surely in the
clouds. None-the-less, a
couple of the strips are worth
reading (probably), Mr.
Monster being the most
memorable, and its life will
really depend on how many
big name comic ﬁgures it can
use and abuse.

Hughes instalment to creep
into the video shop, here's
Madhouse - it may not have
Chevy Chase in it, but it's

chaotic American humour
like a shark waiting for
fresh meat.
Jessie Bannister (Kirstie
Alley) and her husband Mark
(John Larroquette) have just
moved into a new house in
LA, and after a brief
honeymoon period of being
exquisitely h a p y, news that
Mark's cousin and his wife
are corning to stay for a

as it turns out to b e
As you may guess
things go disasterously
wrong for the couple, as
more and more
houseguests arrive to take
over the house, turn it into
a hole for society's drop-
outs, and completely win
the Bannisters* life.
It's all very light hearted
humour, typically American,
infuriating in places, but a
good bet for a chuckle or
two on a rainy night.

PREDATOR 2
#2
Dark Horse
The
second instalment of
the ﬁlm adaptation ﬁnally hits us,
just as the ﬁlm zooms by at a
speed known only to people who
fall off cliffs, and, as with most
movie comics, its appeal lies
primarily in the quality of the
cinematic effort. Fortunately, The
Predator 2 was a racey action
number that had a large 'boll!"
factor, and if it wasn't for the
incredibly poo-er artworic the
whole comic would've been a
sureﬁre winner.

WOO
EXPRESSO
Fleetway
Another in a long line of Fleetway
one-off comic anthologies
presents us with some quality
European comic strips. This is all,
I presume, an attempt to educate
the masses into ﬁnally accepting
the comic medium as a form of
literature, and
unfortunately it falls rather short -
at the ﬁrst hurdle in fact.
The problem exists in that,
although the content may be
seen as ground breaking and
superbly crafted in foreign lands,
it really is a pile of cack in this
country. The reason for this is
that although the strips are
written and drawn by a few
excellent names, none of the
material supplied is of the quality
for which they are renowned
and, as we know, bad strip +
boring strip = complete deck.

Here it is, the comic inspired by
the forthcoming Lurnsﬁlm
computer game, and it's a real
stonker, I don't mind telling you.
Firstly, it was going to be the
plotline for a new Indy ﬁlm, but
Harrison Ford sad "Knackers to
that, I'm off" and he was! Then, a
computer-related fellow came
along, read the plot and said
"Coo... What a jolly good idea for
a computer game!" and went off
to write a computer game. Now a
comic company (Dark Horse -
Aliens, Predator, Terminator) has
said "What a truly great idea fora
comic!", and it is.
The plot has Indy trekking all
over the world, in typical Indiana
Jones style, and seeking artifacts
that the Nazis are also after with
magical properties. Added to this
is the fact that the strange items
originate from Atlantis and we've
got ourselves a classically written
Spielberg style story that
would've suited Mr. Ford down
to the ground.

At S125m, the most expensive
movie ever made.
Schwarzenegger, director
James Cameron and Linda
Hamilton all return. Incredible
script and effects.
S RATING: $170m in
America, 5300m worldwide.
Carole° hopes!
CRITICAL: With all that
money to be counted, who has
time to read the dailies?
# OSCARS: Special effects,
natch.
SOAPDISH
Kevin Kline, Sally Field and
Whoopi Goldberg in behind-
the-scenes-at-a-soap-opera
comedy. Kline is as good as he
was in A FISH CALLED
WANDA and Robert Downey
Jr. is even better. Hilarious.
S RATING: Comfortable.
CRITICAL: Haven't seen a ﬁnal
cut yet, but should be very
, good.
# OSCARS: Kline, Field and
Goldberg are all past winners.
Downey Jr. deserves a
nomination, but he won't get
one. Screenplay nod.
WHAT ABOUT
BOB?
Very funny teaming of Bill
Murray and Richard Dreyfuss
as a headcase and psychiatrist
who vacation together.
$ RATING: Around S50rn. A
'sleeper' hit
CRITICAL: Average.
# OSCARS: Not unless there's
a Freudian slip.
