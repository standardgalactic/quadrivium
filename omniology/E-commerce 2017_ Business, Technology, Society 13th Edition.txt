Themes
E-commerce has significantly evolved over the last decade. The iPhone was intro-
duced in 2007. The iPad tablet was first introduced in 2010 and has already gone 
through several generations! Cloud services for storing and streaming content, and 
hosting thousands of apps, were not widely available until 2011. Smartphone and tab-
let devices have changed e-commerce into a social, local, and mobile experience. The 
13th edition spotlights the following themes and content: 
Headlines 
•	 Social, Mobile, Local: We include an entire chapter describing social, mobile, and 
local marketing. Content about social networks, the mobile platform, and local 
e-commerce appears throughout the book.
»»
The mobile platform composed of smartphones and tablet computers takes off 
and becomes a major factor in search, marketing, payment, retailing and ser-
vices, and online content, as well as on-demand service companies. Mobile 
device use poses new security and privacy issues as well.
»»
Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, LinkedIn, and 
Snapchat continue their rapid growth, laying the groundwork for a social net-
work marketing platform. 
»»
Location-based services lead to explosive growth in local advertising and mar-
keting.
•	 Online privacy continues to deteriorate, driven by a culture of self-revelation 
and powerful technologies for collecting personal information online without 
the knowledge or consent of users. A growing number of consumers adopt ad 
blockers.
•	 Internet security risks increase; cyberwarfare becomes a new way of conducting 
warfare among nation-states and a national security issue. A growing perception 
of online risk supports a growing lack of trust in e-commerce firms and transac-
tions.
Business
•	 E-commerce revenues surge, despite slow economic growth.
•	 Internet advertising growth continues to outpace traditional advertising, including 
television.
•	 Social marketing grows faster than traditional online marketing like search and 
display advertising.
•	 E-books sales plateau but continue as a major channel for books. Consumers 
increasingly use smartphones and tablets as reader devices. 
•	 Newspapers struggle to define a digital first news service.
•	 Streaming of popular TV shows and movies (Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, and Hulu.
com) becomes a reality, as Internet distributors and Hollywood and TV producers 
strike deals for Web distribution that also protects intellectual property.
•	 “Free” and “freemium” business models compete to support digital content. Sub-
scription services show unexpected strength.

vi	
	
P r e f a c e
•	 New mobile payment platforms continue to emerge to challenge PayPal, including 
Apple Pay, Android Pay, Samsung Pay, and Venmo.
•	 B2B e-commerce exceeds pre-recession levels as firms become more comfortable 
with digital supply chains.
Technology 
•	 Smartphones, tablets, and e-book readers, along with associated cloud-based soft-
ware applications, and coupled with 4G cellular network expansion, fuel rapid 
growth of the mobile platform.
•	 Investment in cloud computing increases, providing the computing infrastructure 
for a massive increase in online digital information content, and e-commerce.
•	 Cloud-based streaming services for music and video challenge sales of downloads 
and physical product.
•	 Software apps fuel growth in app sales, marketing, and advertising; transforming 
software production and distribution.
•	 The cost of developing sophisticated websites continues to drop due to declining 
software and hardware prices and open source software tools.
•	 Internet and cellular network capacity is challenged by the rapid expansion in 
digital traffic generated by mobile devices; the use of bandwidth caps tier-pricing 
expands.
Society
•	 The mobile, “always on” culture in business and family life continues to grow.
•	 Congress considers legislation to regulate the use of personal information for 
behavioral tracking and targeting consumers online.
•	 European countries develop much stronger privacy policies, including Right to be 
Forgotten laws, add a new General Data Protection Regulation (Privacy Shield), 
and continue to expand the rights of citizens vis-à-vis Internet data giants.
•	 States heat up the pursuit of taxes on Internet sales by e-commerce firms.
•	 Intellectual property issues remain a source of conflict with significant movement 
toward resolution in some areas, such as Google’s deals with Hollywood and the 
publishing industry, and Apple’s and Amazon’s deals with e-book and magazine 
publishers.
•	 Net neutrality regulations forbid Internet providers from discriminating against 
types of content, or providing differential service to large players.
•	 P2P piracy traffic declines as paid streaming music and video gains ground, 
although digital piracy of online content remains a significant threat to Hollywood 
and the music industry.
•	 Governments around the world increase surveillance of Internet users and web 
sites in response to national security threats; Google continues to tussle with China 
and other countries over censorship and security issues. Europe ends safe harbor 
protections for U.S. Internet firms.

	
P r e f a c e

•	 Venture capital investing in e-commerce explodes for social, mobile, and local soft-
ware applications. Crowdfunding becomes a new source of funding for e-com-
merce start-ups.
WELCOME TO E-COMMERCE 2017
Since it began in 1995, electronic commerce has grown in the United States from a 
standing start to a $600 billion retail, travel, and media business and a $6.7 trillion 
business-to-business juggernaut, bringing about enormous change in business firms, 
markets, and consumer behavior. Economies and business firms around the globe are 
being similarly affected. During this relatively short time, e-commerce has itself been 
transformed from its origin as a mechanism for online retail sales into something 
much broader. Today, e-commerce has become the platform for media and new, 
unique services and capabilities that aren’t found in the physical world. There is no 
physical world counterpart to Facebook, Twittter, Google search, or a host of other 
recent online innovations from Pinterest and iTunes to Tumblr. The Internet is about 
to replace television as the largest entertainment platform. Welcome to the new 
e-commerce!
E-commerce is projected to continue growing at double-digit rates over the next 
five years, remaining the fastest growing form of commerce. Just as automobiles, 
airplanes, and electronics defined the twentieth century, so will e-commerce of all 
kinds define business and society in the twenty-first century. The rapid movement 
toward an e-commerce economy and society is being led by both established business 
firms such as Walmart, Ford, IBM, Macy’s, and General Electric, and online firms 
such as Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Yahoo, Twitter, and YouTube. Students of 
business and information technology need a thorough grounding in e-commerce in 
order to be effective and successful managers in the next decade.
While firms such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Pinterest, and Uber have grown 
explosively in the last two years and grab our attention, the traditional forms of retail 
e-commerce and services also remain vital and have proven to be more resilient than 
traditional retail channels in facing the economic recession. The experience of these 
firms from 1995 to the present is also a focus of this book. The defining characteristic 
of these firms is that they are profitable, sustainable, efficient, and innovative, with 
powerful brand names. Many of these now-experienced retail and service firms, such 
as eBay, Amazon, E*Trade, Priceline, and Expedia, are survivors of the first era of 
e-commerce. These surviving firms have evolved their business models, integrated 
their online and offline operations, and changed their revenue models to become 
profitable. Understanding how these online businesses succeeded will help students 
to manage their own firms in the current omni-channel business environment. 
It would be foolish to ignore the lessons learned in the early period of e-commerce. 
Like so many technology revolutions in the past—automobiles, electricity, tele-
phones, television, and biotechnology—there was an explosion of entrepreneurial 
efforts, followed by consolidation. By 2005, the survivors of the early period were 
moving to establish profitable businesses while maintaining rapid growth in reve-
nues. In 2016, e-commerce is in the midst of a new period of explosive entrepreneur-

P r e f a c e
ial activity focusing on on-demand services, social networks, and the mobile platform 
created by smartphones and tablet computers. These technologies and social behav-
iors are bringing about extraordinary changes to our personal lives, markets, indus-
tries, individual businesses, and society as a whole. E-commerce is generating 
thousands of new jobs in all fields from marketing to management, entrepreneurial 
studies, and information systems. Today, e-commerce has moved into the main-
stream life of established businesses that have the market brands and financial mus-
cle required for the long-term deployment of e-commerce technologies and methods. 
If you are working in an established business, chances are the firm’s e-commerce 
capabilities are important factors for its success. If you want to start a new business, 
chances are very good that the knowledge you learn in this book will be very helpful.
BUSINESS. TECHNOLOGY. SOCIETY.
We believe that in order for business and technology students to really understand  
e-commerce, they must understand the relationships among e-commerce business 
concerns, Internet technology, and the social and legal context of e-commerce. These 
three themes permeate all aspects of e-commerce, and therefore, in each chapter, we 
present material that explores the business, technological, and social aspects of that 
chapter’s main topic.
Given the continued growth and diffusion of e-commerce, all students—regard-
less of their major discipline—must also understand the basic economic and busi-
ness forces driving e-commerce. E-commerce has created new digital markets 
where prices are more transparent, markets are global, and trading is highly effi-
cient, though not perfect. E-commerce has a direct impact on a firm’s relationship 
with suppliers, customers, competitors, and partners, as well as how firms market 
products, advertise, and use brands. Whether you are interested in marketing and 
sales, design, production, finance, information systems, or logistics, you will need 
to know how e-commerce technologies can be used to reduce supply chain costs, 
increase production efficiency, and tighten the relationship with customers. This 
text is written to help you understand the fundamental business issues in e-com-
merce.
We spend a considerable amount of effort analyzing the business models and 
strategies of both online companies and established businesses now employing 
“bricks-and-clicks” business models. We explore why e-commerce firms fail and the 
strategic, financial, marketing, and organizational challenges they face. We also dis-
cuss how e-commerce firms learned from the mistakes of early firms, and how estab-
lished firms are using e-commerce to succeed. Above all, we attempt to bring a strong 
sense of business realism and sensitivity to the often exaggerated descriptions of 
e-commerce. 
The Web and mobile platform have caused a major revolution in marketing and 
advertising in the United States. We spend two chapters discussing online marketing 
and advertising. Chapter 6 discusses “traditional” online marketing formats like 
search engine marketing, display advertising, and e-mail, as well as various Internet 
marketing technologies underlying those efforts, and metrics for measuring market-

	
P r e f a c e

ix
ing success. Chapter 7 provides an in-depth examination of social, mobile, and local 
marketing, which relies on mobile devices and social networks.
E-commerce is driven by Internet technology. Internet technology, and infor-
mation technology in general, is perhaps the star of the show. Without the Internet, 
e-commerce would be virtually nonexistent. Accordingly, we provide three chapters 
specifically on the Internet and e-commerce technology, and in every chapter we 
provide continuing coverage by illustrating how the topic of the chapter is being 
shaped by new information technologies. For instance, Internet technology drives 
developments in security and payment systems, marketing strategies and advertis-
ing, financial applications, media distribution, business-to-business trade, and retail 
e-commerce. We discuss the rapid growth of the mobile platform, the emergence of 
cloud computing, new open source software tools and applications, and new types 
of Internet-based information systems that support digital business-to-business 
markets.
E-commerce is not only about business and technology, however. The third part 
of the equation for understanding e-commerce is society. E-commerce and Internet 
technologies have important social consequences that business leaders can ignore 
only at their peril. E-commerce has challenged our concepts of privacy, intellectual 
property, and even our ideas about national sovereignty and governance. Google, 
Facebook, Amazon, and assorted advertising networks maintain profiles on millions 
of shoppers and consumers worldwide. The proliferation of illegally copied music, 
videos, and books on the Internet, and the growth of social network sites often based 
on displaying copyrighted materials without permission, are challenging the intel-
lectual property rights of record labels, Hollywood studios, artists, and writers. And 
many countries—including the United States—are demanding to control the content 
of websites displayed within their borders for political and social reasons. Tax author-
ities in the United States and Europe are demanding that e-commerce sites pay sales 
taxes just like ordinary brick and mortar stores on Main Street. As a result of these 
challenges to existing institutions, e-commerce and the Internet are the subject of 
increasing investigation, litigation, and legislation. Business leaders need to under-
stand these societal developments, and they cannot afford to assume any longer that 
the Internet is borderless, beyond social control and regulation, or a place where 
market efficiency is the only consideration. In addition to an entire chapter devoted 
to the social and legal implications of e-commerce, each chapter contains material 
highlighting the social implications of e-commerce.
FEATURES AND COVERAGE
Strong Conceptual Foundation  The book emphasizes the three major driving forces 
behind e-commerce: business development and strategy, technological innovations, 
and social controversies and impacts. Each of these driving forces is represented in 
every chapter, and together they provide a strong and coherent conceptual frame-
work for understanding e-commerce. We analyze e-commerce, digital markets, and 
e-business firms just as we would ordinary businesses and markets using concepts 
from economics, marketing, finance, sociology, philosophy, and information sys-

x	
	
P r e f a c e
tems. We strive to maintain a critical perspective on e-commerce and avoid industry 
hyperbole. 
Some of the important concepts from economics and marketing that we use to 
explore e-commerce are transaction cost, network externalities, information asym-
metry, social networks, perfect digital markets, segmentation, price dispersion, tar-
geting, and positioning. Important concepts from the study of information systems 
and technologies play an important role in the book, including Internet standards and 
protocols, client/server computing, cloud computing, mobile platform and wireless 
technologies, and public key encryption, among many others. From the literature on 
ethics and society, we use important concepts such as intellectual property, privacy, 
information rights and rights management, governance, public health, and welfare.
From the literature on business, we use concepts such as business process design, 
return on investment, strategic advantage, industry competitive environment, oli-
gopoly, and monopoly. We also provide a basic understanding of finance and account-
ing issues, and extend this through an “E-commerce in Action” case that critically 
examines the financial statements of Amazon. One of the witticisms that emerged 
from the early years of e-commerce and that still seems apt is the notion that e-com-
merce changes everything except the rules of business. Businesses still need to make 
a profit in order to survive in the long term.
Currency  Important new developments happen almost every day in e-commerce 
and the Internet. We try to capture as many of these important new developments as 
possible in each annual edition. You will not find a more current book for a course 
offered for the 2017 academic year. Many other texts are already six months to a year 
out of date before they even reach the printer. This text, in contrast, reflects extensive 
research through October 2016, just weeks before the book hits the press.
Real-World Business Firm Focus and Cases  From Akamai Technologies to Google, 
Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon, to Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr, to Netflix, Pandora, 
and Elemica, this book contains hundreds of real-company examples and over 60 
more extensive cases that place coverage in the context of actual e-commerce busi-
nesses. You’ll find these examples in each chapter, as well as in special features such 
as chapter-opening, chapter-closing, and “Insight on” cases. The book takes a realistic 
look at the world of e-commerce, describing what’s working and what isn’t, rather 
than presenting a rose-colored or purely “academic” viewpoint.
In-depth Coverage of Marketing and Advertising  The text includes two chapters on 
marketing and advertising, both traditional online marketing and social, mobile, and 
local marketing. Marketing concepts, including market segmentation, personaliza-
tion, clickstream analysis, bundling of digital goods, long-tail marketing, and dynamic 
pricing, are used throughout the text.
In-depth Coverage of B2B E-commerce  We devote an entire chapter to an examina-
tion of B2B e-commerce. In writing this chapter, we developed a unique and easily 
understood classification schema to help students understand this complex arena of 
e-commerce. This chapter covers e-distributors, e-procurement companies, exchanges, 

	
P r e f a c e 	

xi
and industry consortia, as well as the development of private industrial networks and 
collaborative commerce.
Current and Future Technology Coverage  Internet and related information tech-
nologies continue to change rapidly. The most important changes for e-commerce 
include dramatic price reductions in e-commerce infrastructure (making it much less 
expensive to develop a sophisticated e-commerce presence), the explosive growth in 
the mobile platform such as iPhones, iPads, and tablet computers, and expansion in 
the development of social technologies, which are the foundation of online social 
networks. What was once a shortage of telecommunications capacity has now turned 
into a surplus, PC prices have continued to fall, smartphone and tablet sales have 
soared, Internet high-speed broadband connections are now typical and are continu-
ing to show double-digit growth, and wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi and cellular 
broadband are transforming how, when, and where people access the Internet. While 
we thoroughly discuss the current Internet environment, we devote considerable 
attention to describing emerging technologies and applications such as the Internet 
of Things, advanced network infrastructure, fiber optics, wireless and 4G technolo-
gies, Wi-Fi, IP multicasting, and future guaranteed service levels.
Up-to-Date Coverage of the Research Literature  This text is well grounded in the  
e-commerce research literature. We have sought to include, where appropriate, refer-
ences and analysis of the latest e-commerce research findings, as well as many classic 
articles, in all of our chapters. We have drawn especially on the disciplines of eco-
nomics, marketing, and information systems and technologies, as well as law jour-
nals and broader social science research journals including sociology and psychology.
We do not use references to Wikipedia in this text, for a variety of reasons. Most 
colleges do not consider Wikipedia a legitimate or acceptable source for academic 
research and instruct their students not to cite it. Material found on Wikipedia may 
be out of date, lack coverage, lack critical perspective, and cannot necessarily be 
trusted. Our references are to respected academic journals; industry sources such as 
eMarketer, comScore, Hitwise, Nielsen, and Gartner; newspapers such as the New 
York Times and Wall Street Journal; and industry publications such as Computerworld 
and InformationWeek, among others. Figures and tables sourced to “authors’ estimates” 
reflect analysis of data from the U.S. Department of Commerce, estimates from vari-
ous research firms, historical trends, revenues of major online retailers, consumer 
online buying trends, and economic conditions.
Special Attention to the Social and Legal Aspects of E-commerce  We have paid 
special attention throughout the book to the social and legal context of e-commerce. 
Chapter 8 is devoted to a thorough exploration of four ethical dimensions of e-com-
merce: information privacy, intellectual property, governance, and protecting public 
welfare on the Internet. We have included an analysis of the latest Federal Trade 
Commission and other regulatory and nonprofit research reports, and their likely 
impact on the e-commerce environment.
A major theme throughout this chapter, and the remainder of the book, is the 
impact of social, mobile, and local commerce on how consumers use the Internet.

Writing That’s Fun to Read  Unlike some textbooks, we’ve been told by many stu-
dents that this book is actually fun to read and easy to understand. This is not a book 
written by committee—you won’t find a dozen different people listed as authors, co-
authors, and contributors on the title page. We have a consistent voice and perspec-
tive that carries through the entire text and we believe the book is the better for it. 
OVERVIEW OF THE BOOK
The book is organized into four parts.
Part 1, “Introduction to E-commerce,” provides an introduction to the major 
themes of the book. Chapter 1 defines e-commerce, distinguishes between 
e-commerce and e-business, and defines the different types of e-commerce. Chapter 
2 introduces and defines the concepts of business model and revenue model, 
describes the major e-commerce business and revenue models for both B2C and B2B 
firms, and introduces the basic business concepts required throughout the text for 
understanding e-commerce firms including industry structure, value chains, and firm 
strategy.
Part 2, “Technology Infrastructure for E-commerce,” focuses on the technology 
infrastructure that forms the foundation for all e-commerce. Chapter 3 traces the 
historical development of the Internet and thoroughly describes how today’s Internet 
works. A major focus of this chapter is mobile technology, new software applications, 
and the near-term future Internet that is now under development and will shape the 
future of e-commerce. Chapter 4 builds on the Internet chapter by focusing on the 
steps managers need to follow in order to build an e-commerce presence. This e-com-
merce infrastructure chapter covers the process that should be followed in building 
an e-commerce presence; the major decisions regarding outsourcing site develop-
ment and/or hosting; how to choose software, hardware, and other tools that can 
improve website performance; and issues involved in developing a mobile website 
and mobile applications. Chapter 5 focuses on e-commerce security and payments, 
building on the e-commerce infrastructure discussion of the previous chapter by 
describing the ways security can be provided over the Internet. This chapter defines 
digital information security, describes the major threats to security, and then dis-
cusses both the technology and policy solutions available to business managers seek-
ing to secure their firm’s sites. This chapter concludes with a section on e-commerce 
payment systems. We identify the various types of online payment systems (credit 
cards, stored value payment systems such as PayPal, digital wallets such as Google 
Wallet, and others), and the development of mobile and social payment systems such 
as Apple Pay, Venmo, and Facebook Messenger.
Part 3, “Business Concepts and Social Issues,” focuses directly on the business 
concepts and social-legal issues that surround the development of e-commerce. Chap-
ter 6 focuses on e-commerce consumer behavior, the Internet audience, and intro-
duces the student to the basics of online marketing and branding, including traditional 
online marketing technologies and marketing strategies. Topics include the website 
as a marketing platform, search engine marketing and advertising, display ad market-
ing, e-mail campaigns, affiliate and lead generation marketing programs, multichan-

	
P r e f a c e

nel marketing, and various customer retention strategies such as personalization 
(including interest-based advertising, also known as behavioral targeting) and cus-
tomer service tools. The chapter also covers other marketing strategies such as pric-
ing and long-tail marketing. Internet marketing technologies (web transaction logs, 
tracking files, data mining, and Big Data) and marketing automation and CRM sys-
tems are also explored. The chapter concludes with a section on understanding the 
costs and benefits of various types of online marketing, including a new section on 
marketing analytics software. Chapter 7 is devoted to an in-depth analysis of social, 
mobile, and local marketing. Topics include Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest market-
ing platforms, the evolution of mobile marketing, and the growing use of geo-aware 
technologies to support proximity marketing. Chapter 8 provides a thorough intro-
duction to the social and legal environment of e-commerce. Here, you will find a 
description of the ethical and legal dimensions of e-commerce, including a thorough 
discussion of the latest developments in personal information privacy, intellectual 
property, Internet governance, jurisdiction, and public health and welfare issues such 
as pornography, gambling, and health information.
Part 4, “E-commerce in Action,” focuses on real-world e-commerce experiences 
in retail and services, online media, auctions, portals, and social networks, and busi-
ness-to-business e-commerce. These chapters take a sector approach rather than the 
conceptual approach used in the earlier chapters. E-commerce is different in each of 
these sectors. Chapter 9 takes a close look at the experience of firms in the retail mar-
ketplace for both goods and services, as well as on-demand service companies such 
as Uber and Airbnb. Chapter 9 also includes an "E-commerce in Action" case that 
provides a detailed analysis of the business strategies and financial operating results 
of Amazon, which can be used as a model to analyze other e-commerce firms. Chap-
ter 10 explores the world of online content and digital media and examines the enor-
mous changes in online publishing and entertainment industries that have occurred 
over the last two years, including streaming movies, e-books, and online newspapers 
and magazines. Chapter 11 explores the online world of social networks, auctions, 
and portals. Chapter 12 concentrates on the world of B2B e-commerce, describing 
both Net marketplaces and the less-heralded, but very large arena of private indus-
trial networks and the movement toward collaborative commerce.
PEDAGOGY AND CHAPTER OUTLINE
The book’s pedagogy emphasizes student cognitive awareness and the ability to ana-
lyze, synthesize, and evaluate e-commerce businesses. While there is a strong data 
and conceptual foundation to the book, we seek to engage student interest with lively 
writing about e-commerce businesses and the transformation of business models at 
traditional firms. 
Each chapter contains a number of elements designed to make learning easy as 
well as interesting.
Learning Objectives  A list of learning objectives that highlights the key concepts in 
the chapter guides student study.

“Insight on” Cases  Each chapter 
contains three real-world cases 
illustrating the themes of technol-
ogy, business, and society. These 
cases take an in-depth look at rel-
evant topics to help describe and 
analyze the full breadth of the 
field of e-commerce. The 
cases probe such issues 
as the ability of govern-
ments 
to 
regulate 
Internet content, how 
to design websites for 
accessibility, 
the 
challenges faced by 
luxury marketers in 
online marketing, 
and 
smartphone 
security.
Margin Glossary         
Throughout the text, key 
terms and their definitions 
appear in the text margin 
where they are first intro-
duced.
Real-Company Examples

P r e f a c e
Chapter-Closing Case Studies  Each chap-
ter concludes with a robust case study based 
on a real-world organization. These cases 
help students synthesize chapter concepts 
and apply this knowledge to concrete prob-
lems and scenarios such as evaluating Pan-
dora’s 
freemium 
business 
model, 
ExchangeHunterJumper’s efforts to build 
a brand, and the evolution of eBay. 
Chapter-Ending Pedagogy  Each chap-
ter contains extensive end-of-chapter 
materials designed to reinforce the 
learning objectives of the chapter.
Key Concepts  Keyed to the learn-
ing objectives, Key Concepts pres-
ent the key points of the chapter to 
aid student study.
Review Questions  Thought-pro-
voking questions prompt stu-
dents to demonstrate their 
comprehension and apply chapter con-
cepts to management problem solving.
Projects  At the end of each chapter are a number of projects that encourage students 
to apply chapter concepts and to use higher level evaluation skills. Many make use of 
the Internet and require students to present their findings in an oral or electronic pre-
sentation or written report. For instance, students are asked to evaluate publicly avail-
able information about a company’s financials at the SEC website, assess payment 
system options for companies across international 
boundaries, or search for the top 10 cookies on their 
own computer and the sites they are from.
Web Resources  Web resources that can extend stu-
dents’ knowledge of each chapter with projects, 
exercises, and additional content are available at 
www.azimuth-interactive.com/ecommerce13e. The 
website contains the following content provided by 
the authors:

f you were trying to pick iconic 
examples of e-commerce in the 
two decades since it began in 
1995, it is likely that companies such 
as Amazon, eBay, Google, Apple, and 
Facebook would be high on the list. 
Today, there’s a new company that is 
becoming the face of e-commerce as it 
enters its third decade: Uber. Uber and 
other firms with similar business models, 
such as Lyft (a ride service similar to 
Uber’s), Airbnb (rooms for rent), Heal 
(doctor home visits), Handy (part-time 
household helpers), Instacart (grocery 
shopping), Washio (laundry service), and 
BloomThat (flower delivery), are the pio-
neers of a new on-demand service e-commerce business model that is sweeping up billions 
of investment dollars and disrupting major industries, from transportation to hotels, real 
estate, house cleaning, maintenance, and grocery shopping. On-demand service firms have 
collected over $26 billion in venture capital funding over the last five years, making this 
the hottest business model in e-commerce.
Uber offers a variety of different services. The two most common are UberX, which 
uses compact sedans and is the least expensive, and UberBlack, which provides higher-
priced town car service. UberPool is a ride-sharing service that allows users to share a 
ride with another person who happens to be going to the same place. In several cities, Uber 
is developing UberEats, a food delivery service; UberRush, a same-day delivery service; 
and UberCargo, a trucking service. 
Uber, headquartered in San Francisco, was founded in 2009 by Travis Kalanick and 
Garrett Camp, and has grown explosively since then to over 480 cities in 69 countries. 
Drivers are signing up at an exponential rate: as of the beginning of 2016, there were 
over 450,000 drivers in the United States and over 1 million worldwide. According to 
an Uber-sponsored survey, over 44% of Uber drivers have college degrees (compared to 
15% of taxi drivers), 71% say they have boosted their income and financial security by 
driving for Uber, and 73% say they prefer a job where they choose their hours rather than 
a 9-to-5 job. It is estimated that Uber’s revenue will reach around $2 billion in 2016, 
but it is still not expected to generate an overall profit, with losses in developing markets

such as China and India swallowing up profits being generated in North America, Europe, 
and elsewhere. Uber’s strategy is to expand as fast as possible while foregoing short-term 
profits in the hope of long-term returns. As of July 2016, Uber has raised over $12.5 
billion in venture capital. Uber is currently valued at around $68 billion, more than all 
of its competitors combined. In August 2016, Uber agreed to sell Uber China, where it 
had been engaged in a costly turf war for Chinese riders, to Didi Chuxing Technology, its 
primary Chinese rival. Uber will receive a 18% interest in Didi Chuxing and Didi will invest 
$1 billion in Uber. In doing so, Uber converted a reported $2 billion loss on its Chinese 
operations into a new merged entity valued at around $7 billion, and freed up capital to 
invest more heavily in other emerging markets such as Indonesia and India where it does 
not have such significant competition. 
Uber offers a compelling value proposition for both customers and drivers. Customers 
can sign up for free, request and pay for a ride (at a cost Uber claims is 40% less than 
a traditional taxi) using a smartphone and credit card, and get picked up within a few 
minutes. No need to stand on a street corner frantically waving, competing with others, 
or waiting and waiting for an available cab to drive by, without knowing when that might 
happen. Instead, customers using the Uber app know just how long it will take for the 
ride to arrive and how much it will cost. With UberPool ride-sharing, the cost of a ride 
drops by 50%, making it cost-competitive with owning a car in an urban area, according 
to Uber. Uber’s value proposition for drivers is that it allows them to set their own hours, 
work when they like, and put their own cars to use generating revenue.
Uber is the current poster child for “digital disruption.” It is easy to see why Uber 
has ignited a firestorm of opposition from existing taxi services both in the United States 
and around the world. Who can compete in a market where a new upstart firm offers a 
50% price reduction? If you’ve paid $1 million for a license to drive a taxi in New York 
City, what is it worth now that Uber has arrived? Even governments find Uber to be a 
disruptive threat. Governments do not want to give up regulatory control over passenger 
safety, driver training, nor the healthy revenue stream generated by charging taxi firms 
for a taxi license and sales taxes. 
Uber’s business model differs from traditional retail e-commerce. Uber doesn’t sell 
goods. Instead it has created a smartphone-based platform that enables people who want 
a service—like a taxi—to find a provider with the resources, such as a personal automobile 
and a driver with available time, to fill the demand. It’s important to understand that 
although Uber and similar firms are often called “sharing economy” companies, this is 
a misnomer. Uber drivers are selling their services as drivers and the temporary use of 
their car. Uber itself is not in the sharing business either: it charges a hefty fee for every 
transaction on its platform. Uber is not an example of true “peer-to-peer” e-commerce 
because Uber transactions involve an online intermediary: a third party that takes a cut 
of all transactions and arranges for the marketplace to exist in the first place. 
Uber has disrupted the traditional taxi business model because it offers a superior, 
fast, convenient taxi-hailing service when compared to traditional taxi companies. With 
a traditional taxi service, there is no guarantee you will find a cab. Uber reduces that 
uncertainty: the customer enters a request for pickup using his or her smartphone and

nearly instantly (under the best of circumstances), Uber finds a provider and notifies the 
customer of the estimated time of arrival and price. Riders can accept the price or find 
an alternative. 
Uber’s business model is much more efficient than a traditional taxi firm. Uber 
does not own taxis and has no maintenance and financing costs. Uber calls its drivers 
“independent contractors,” not employees. Doing so enables Uber to avoid costs for 
workers’ compensation, minimum wage requirements, driver training, health insurance, 
and commercial licensing. 
Quality control would seem to be a nightmare with over 1 million contract drivers. But 
Uber relies on user reviews to identify problematic drivers and driver reviews to identify 
problematic passengers. Drivers are evaluated by riders on a 5-point scale. Drivers that 
fall below 4.5 are warned and may be dropped if they don’t improve. Customers are also 
rated with a 5-point system. Drivers can refuse to pick up troublesome customers, and 
the Uber server can delay service to potential customers with low ratings or ban them 
entirely. Uber does not publicly report how many poorly rated drivers or passengers there 
are in its system. Academic articles have found that in similar on-demand companies, 
such as Airbnb, there is a built-in bias for both sellers and buyers to give good reviews 
regardless of the actual experience. If you routinely give low reviews to sellers (drivers), 
they will think you are too demanding and not service you in the future. If a driver gives 
low reviews to passengers, they might not rate you highly in return. 
Rather than having a dispatcher in every city, Uber has an Internet-based app service 
running on cloud servers located throughout the world. It does not provide radios to its 
drivers, who instead must use their own smartphones and cell service, which the drivers 
pay for. It does not provide insurance or maintenance for its drivers’ cars. Uber has shifted 
the costs of running a taxi service entirely to the drivers. Uber charges prices that vary 
dynamically with demand: the higher the demand, the greater the price of a ride. Therefore, 
it is impossible using public information to know if Uber’s prices are lower than traditional 
taxis. Clearly, in high-demand situations they are higher, sometimes ten times higher, than 
a regulated taxi. There is no regulatory taxi commission setting uniform per mile fares. 
Consumers do face some traditional uncertainties regarding availability: during a rain 
storm, a convention, or a sports event, when demand peaks, not enough drivers may be 
available at any price. 
If Uber is the poster child for the new on-demand service economy, it’s also an iconic 
example of the social costs and conflicts associated with this new kind of e-commerce. 
Uber has been accused by attorney generals in several states of misclassifying its drivers as 
contractors as opposed to employees, thereby denying the drivers the benefits of employee 
status, such as minimum wages, social security, workers’ compensation, and health insur-
ance. In June 2015, the California Labor Commission ruled that an Uber driver was, in 
fact, an employee under the direct, detailed supervision and control of Uber management, 
notwithstanding Uber’s claims that it merely provides a “platform.” However, the ruling 
applied only to that individual driver, and Uber is appealing the decision. In April 2016, 
Uber settled two federal class action lawsuits brought in California and Massachusetts 
on behalf of an estimated 385,000 drivers, who sued the company for mistreatment and

lack of due process, including barring them from the app without explanation, lack of 
transparency in how driver ratings are calculated, and deactivating drivers who regularly 
declined to accept requests. Uber agreed to pay up to $84 million to the drivers, give 
them more information about why they are barred from using the app, assist drivers in 
forming “driver associations” in these two states, and review its policy of no tipping. Uber 
also agreed to pay an additional $16 million if it goes public next year with a valuation 
exceeding $93.75 billion. The company retained the right to shut out drivers temporarily 
if their acceptance rates are low and can deactivate drivers completely if they have high 
cancellation rates. Most importantly, the settlement allowed Uber to continue classifying 
its drivers as independent contractors in California and Massachusetts, enabling Uber to 
continue not paying for workers’ compensation insurance, health insurance, or overtime 
work. However, in August 2016, a federal district court judge in California rejected the 
terms of the settlement on the grounds that it was unfair and unreasonable, and as a 
result, Uber and the parties to the lawsuit have resumed negotiations. The terms on which 
the lawsuit are finally resolved may have a significant effect on the on-demand services 
business model.
Uber has also been accused of violating public transportation laws and regulations 
throughout the United States and the world; abusing the personal information it has 
collected on users of the service; seeking to use personal information to intimidate jour-
nalists; failing to protect public safety by refusing to do adequate criminal, medical, and 
financial background checks on its drivers; taking clandestine actions against its chief 
competitor Lyft in order to disrupt its business; and being tone-deaf to the complaints of 
its own drivers against the firm’s efforts to reduce driver fees. Uber has been banned in 
several European cities. 
Critics also fear the long-term impact of on-demand service firms, because of their 
potential for creating a society of part-time, low-paid, temp work, displacing traditionally 
full-time, secure jobs—the so-called “uberization” of work. As one critic put it, Uber is 
not the Uber for rides so much as it is the Uber for low-paid jobs. Uber responds to this 
fear by claiming that it is lowering the cost of transportation, making better use of spare 
human and financial resources, expanding the demand for ride services, and expanding 
opportunities for car drivers, whose pay is about the same as other taxi drivers. 
Despite the controversy surrounding it, Uber continues to have no trouble attracting 
additional investors and according to CEO Kalanick, plans to remain a private company 
for the foreseeable future. Although Uber currently has a host of rivals, both big and small, 
most analysts expect that ultimately, only one or two major players will remain. Uber is 
doing everything it can to assure that it will be the one to prevail.

n 1994, e-commerce as we now know it did not exist. In 2016, just 22 years 
later, around 177 million American consumers are expected to spend about 
$600 billion, and businesses around $6.7 trillion, purchasing goods, services, 
and digital content via a desktop computer or mobile device. A similar story has 
occurred throughout the world. And in this short period of time, e-commerce has been 
reinvented not just once, but twice.
The early years of e-commerce, during the late 1990s, were a period of business 
vision, inspiration, and experimentation. It soon became apparent, however, that 
establishing a successful business model based on those visions would not be easy. 
There followed a period of retrenchment and reevaluation, which led to the stock 
market crash of 2000–2001, with the value of e-commerce, telecommunications, and 
other technology stocks plummeting. After the bubble burst, many people were quick 
to write off e-commerce. But they were wrong. The surviving firms refined and honed 
their business models, and the technology became more powerful and less expensive, 
ultimately leading to business firms that actually produced profits. Between 2002–2008, 
retail e-commerce grew at more than 25% per year.
Today, we are in the middle of yet another transition. Social networks such as 
Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest, Instagram, and Tumblr, which enable users to 
distribute their own content (such as videos, music, photos, personal information, 
commentary, blogs, and more), have rocketed to prominence. Never before in the 
history of media have such large audiences been aggregated and made so accessible. 
At the same time, mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablet computers, and 
mobile apps have supplanted the traditional desktop/laptop platform and web browser 
as the most common method for consumers to access the Internet. Facilitated by 
technologies such as cloud computing, cellular networks, and Wi-Fi, mobile devices 
have become advertising, shopping, reading, and media viewing machines, and in 
the process, are transforming consumer behavior yet again. Mobile, social, and local 
have become driving forces in e-commerce. The mobile platform infrastructure has 
also given birth to yet another e-commerce innovation: on-demand services that are 
local and personal. From hailing a taxi, to shopping, to washing your clothes, these 
new businesses are creating a marketspace where owners of resources such as cars, 
spare bedrooms, and spare time can find a market of eager consumers looking to buy 
a service in a few minutes using their smartphones. Uber, profiled in the opening 
case, is a leading example of these new on-demand service firms that are disrupting 
traditional business models.

THE FIRST THIRTY SECONDS: WHY YOU SHOULD STUDY  
E-COMMERCE
The rapid growth and change that has occurred in the first two decades of e-com-
merce represents just the beginning—what could be called the first 30 seconds of the 
e-commerce revolution. Technology continues to evolve at exponential rates. This 

8	
	
C H A P T E R  1     T h e  R e v o l u t i o n  I s  J u s t  B e g i n n i n g
underlying ferment presents entrepreneurs with new opportunities to create new 
business models and businesses in traditional industries and in the process, disrupt, 
and in some instances, destroy existing business models and firms.
Improvements in underlying information technologies and continuing entrepre-
neurial innovation in business and marketing promise as much change in the next 
decade as was seen in the previous two decades. The twenty-first century will be the 
age of a digitally enabled social and commercial life, the outlines of which we can still 
only barely perceive at this time. Analysts estimate that by 2020, consumers will be 
spending around $933 billion and businesses around $9.1 trillion in digital transactions. 
It appears likely that e-commerce will eventually impact nearly all commerce, and 
that most commerce will be e-commerce by the year 2050, if not sooner.
Business fortunes are made—and lost—in periods of extraordinary change such 
as this. The next five years hold exciting opportunities—as well as risks—for new and 
traditional businesses to exploit digital technology for market advantage. For society 
as a whole, the next few decades offer the possibility of extraordinary gains in social 
wealth as the digital revolution works its way through larger and larger segments of 
the world’s economy.
It is important to study e-commerce in order to be able to perceive and understand 
the opportunities and risks that lie ahead. By the time you finish this book, you will 
be able to identify the technological, business, and social forces that have shaped, 
and continue to shape, the growth of e-commerce, and be ready to participate in, and 
ultimately guide, discussions of e-commerce in the firms where you work. More specifi-
cally, you will be able to analyze an existing or new idea for an e-commerce business, 
identify the most effective business model to use, and understand the technological 
underpinnings of an e-commerce presence, including the security and ethical issues 
raised, as well as how to optimally market and advertise the business, using both 
traditional e-marketing tools and social, mobile, and local marketing.

INTRODUCTION TO E-COMMERCE
In this section, we’ll first define e-commerce and then discuss the difference between 
e-commerce and e-business. We will also introduce you to the major technological 
building blocks underlying e-commerce: the Internet, Web, and mobile platform. The 
section concludes with a look at some major current trends in e-commerce.
WHAT IS E-COMMERCE?
E-commerce involves the use of the Internet, the World Wide Web (Web), and mobile 
apps and browsers running on mobile devices to transact business. Although the terms 
Internet and Web are often used interchangeably, they are actually two very different 
things. The Internet is a worldwide network of computer networks, and the Web is one 
of the Internet’s most popular services, providing access to billions of web pages. An 
app (short-hand for application) is a software application. The term is typically used 
when referring to mobile applications, although it is also sometimes used to refer to 
desktop computer applications as well. A mobile browser is a version of web browser 
e-commerce
the use of the Internet, the 
Web, and mobile apps and 
browsers running on 
mobile devices to transact 
business. More formally, 
digitally enabled commer-
cial transactions between 
and among organizations 
and individuals

software accessed via a mobile device. (We describe the Internet, Web, and mobile 
platform more fully later in this chapter and in Chapters 3 and 4.) More formally, 
e-commerce can be defined as digitally enabled commercial transactions between and 
among organizations and individuals. Each of these components of our working defini-
tion of e-commerce is important. Digitally enabled transactions include all transactions 
mediated by digital technology. For the most part, this means transactions that occur 
over the Internet, the Web, and/or via mobile devices. Commercial transactions involve 
the exchange of value (e.g., money) across organizational or individual boundaries in 
return for products and services. Exchange of value is important for understanding 
the limits of e-commerce. Without an exchange of value, no commerce occurs. 
The professional literature sometimes refers to e-commerce as digital commerce. 
For our purposes, we consider e-commerce and digital commerce to be synonymous. 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN E-COMMERCE AND E-BUSINESS
There is a debate about the meaning and limitations of both e-commerce and e-busi-
ness. Some argue that e-commerce encompasses the entire world of electronically 
based organizational activities that support a firm’s market exchanges—including a 
firm’s entire information system infrastructure (Rayport and Jaworski, 2003). Others 
argue, on the other hand, that e-business encompasses the entire world of internal and 
external electronically based activities, including e-commerce (Kalakota and Robinson, 
2003).
We think it is important to make a working distinction between e-commerce and 
e-business because we believe they refer to different phenomena. E-commerce is not 
“anything digital” that a firm does. For purposes of this text, we will use the term 
e‑business to refer primarily to the digital enabling of transactions and processes 
within a firm, involving information systems under the control of the firm. For the 
most part, in our view, e-business does not include commercial transactions involving 
an exchange of value across organizational boundaries. For example, a company’s 
online inventory control mechanisms are a component of e-business, but such internal 
processes do not directly generate revenue for the firm from outside businesses or 
consumers, as e-commerce, by definition, does. It is true, however, that a firm’s 
e-business infrastructure provides support for online e-commerce exchanges; the same 
infrastructure and skill sets are involved in both e-business and e-commerce. E-com-
merce and e-business systems blur together at the business firm boundary, at the point 
where internal business systems link up with suppliers or customers (see Figure 1.1). 
E-business applications turn into e-commerce precisely when an exchange of value 
occurs (see Mesenbourg, U.S. Department of Commerce, 2001, for a similar view). We 
will examine this intersection further in Chapter 12.
TECHNOLOGICAL BUILDING BLOCKS UNDERLYING E-COMMERCE: THE 
INTERNET, WEB, AND MOBILE PLATFORM
The technology juggernauts behind e-commerce are the Internet, the Web, and increas-
ingly, the mobile platform. We describe the Internet, Web, and mobile platform in 
some detail in Chapter 3. The Internet is a worldwide network of computer networks 
built on common standards. Created in the late 1960s to connect a small number of

mainframe computers and their users, the Internet has since grown into the world’s 
largest network. It is impossible to say with certainty exactly how many computers 
and other mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are connected to the Inter-
net worldwide at any one time, but some experts estimate the number to be more 
than 5 billion (Camhi, 2015). The Internet links businesses, educational institutions, 
government agencies, and individuals together, and provides users with services such 
as e-mail, document transfer, shopping, research, instant messaging, music, videos, 
and news. 
One way to measure the growth of the Internet is by looking at the number of 
Internet hosts with domain names. (An Internet host is defined by the Internet Systems 
Consortium as any IP address that returns a domain name in the in-addr.arpa domain, 
which is a special part of the DNS namespace that resolves IP addresses into domain 
names.) In January 2016, there were more than 1 billion Internet hosts in over 245 
countries, up from just 70 million in 2000 (Internet Systems Consortium, 2016). 
The Internet has shown extraordinary growth patterns when compared to other 
electronic technologies of the past. It took radio 38 years to achieve a 30% share of 
U.S. households. It took television 17 years to achieve a 30% share. It took only 10 
years for the Internet/Web to achieve a 53% share of U.S. households once a graphical 
user interface was invented for the Web in 1993. Today, in the United States, around 
267 million people of all ages (about 82% of the U.S. population) use the Internet at 
least once a month (eMarketer, Inc. 2016a).
The World Wide Web (the Web) is an information system that runs on the 
Internet infrastructure. The Web was the original “killer app” that made the Internet 
commercially interesting and extraordinarily popular. The Web was developed in the 
early 1990s and hence is of much more recent vintage than the Internet. We describe 
World Wide Web (the 
Web) 
an information system 
running on Internet infra-
structure that provides 
access to billions of web 
pages

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN E-COMMERCE AND 
E-BUSINESS
E-commerce primarily involves transactions that cross firm boundaries. E-business primarily involves the application of 
digital technologies to business processes within the firm.

the Web in some detail in Chapter 3. The Web provides access to billions of web pages 
indexed by Google and other search engines. These pages are created in a language 
called HTML (HyperText Markup Language). HTML pages can contain text, graphics, 
animations, and other objects. The Internet prior to the Web was primarily used for 
text communications, file transfers, and remote computing. The Web introduced far 
more powerful and commercially interesting capabilities of direct relevance to com-
merce. In essence, the Web added color, voice, and video to the Internet, creating a 
communications infrastructure and information storage system that rivals television, 
radio, magazines, and libraries. 
There is no precise measurement of the number of web pages in existence, in 
part because today’s search engines index only a portion of the known universe of 
web pages. Google has identified over 30,000 trillion unique uniform resource locators 
(URLs), commonly known as web addresses, up from 1 trillion in 2008, although many 
of these pages do not necessarily contain unique content (Schwartz, 2015). In addition 
to this “surface” or “visible” Web, there is also the so-called deep Web that is reportedly 
500 to 1,000 times greater than the surface Web. The deep Web contains databases 
and other content that is not routinely indexed by search engines such as Google (see 
Figure 1.2). Although the total size of the Web is not known, what is indisputable is 
that web content has grown exponentially since 1993.
The mobile platform is the newest development in Internet infrastructure. The 
mobile platform provides the ability to access the Internet from a variety of mobile

devices such as smartphones, tablets, and other ultra-lightweight laptop computers 
via wireless networks or cell phone service. Mobile devices are playing an increasingly 
prominent role in Internet access. In 2016, there are over 360 million mobile devices 
in the United States that can be connected to the Internet (more than 1 device for each 
person in the United States), and almost 93% of Americans who access the Internet 
use a mobile device to do so at least some of the time (eMarketer, Inc., 2016b, 2016c). 
Figure 1.3 illustrates the variety of devices used by Americans to access the Internet 
in 2016. 
The mobile platform is not just a hardware phenomenon. The introduction of 
the Apple iPhone in 2007, followed by the Apple iPad in 2010, has also ushered in a 
sea-change in the way people interact with the Internet from a software perspective. 
In the early years of e-commerce, the Web and web browsers were the only game in 
town. Today, in contrast, more Americans access the Internet via a mobile app than 
by using a desktop computer and web browser. Insight on Technology: Will Apps Make 
the Web Irrelevant? examines the challenge that apps and the mobile platform pose to 
the Web’s dominance of the Internet ecosphere in more depth.

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
WILL APPS MAKE THE WEB IRRELEVANT?
Nowadays, it’s hard to recall a time 
before the Web. How did we get along 
without the ability to pull up a web 
browser and search for any item, learn 
about any topic, or play just about any 
type of game? Though the Web has come a 
remarkably long way from its humble beginnings, 
many experts claim that the Web’s best days are 
behind it, and that there’s a new player on the field: 
apps. Opinions vary widely over the future role of 
the Web in a world where apps have become an 
ever larger portion of the Internet marketspace. In 
10 years, will web browsers be forgotten relics, as 
we rely entirely on apps to do both our work and 
our play on the Internet? Will the Web and apps 
coexist peacefully as vital cogs in the Internet eco-
system? Or will the app craze eventually die down 
as tech users gravitate back toward the Web as 
the primary way to perform Internet-related tasks?
Apps have grown into a disruptive force ever 
since Apple launched its App Store in 2008. The 
list of industries apps have disrupted is wide-
ranging: communications, media and entertain-
ment, logistics, education, healthcare, and most 
recently, with Uber, the taxi industry. Despite not 
even existing prior to 2008, in 2016, sales of 
apps are expected to account for over $59 billion 
in revenues worldwide, and the app economy is 
continuing to show robust growth, with estimates 
of over $100 billion in revenue by 2020. More 
of those revenues are likely to come from in-app 
purchases than from paid app downloads. Not 
only that, but the growth is not coming from 
more users trying the same small number of 
apps. Although usage of apps tends to be highly 
concentrated, with nearly 75% of smartphone app 
minutes spent on an individual’s top 3 apps, con-
sumers are trying new apps all the time and visit 
about 27 apps per month, leaving plenty of room 
for new app developers to innovate and create 
best-selling apps. In fact, according to mobile 
advertising company Flurry, 280 million people 
worldwide qualify as mobile addicts, which they 
define as someone who launches a smartphone app 
more than 60 times a day. According to Flurry, the 
number of such addicts increased by about 350% 
from 2013 to 2015. 
In January 2014, for the first time ever, 
Americans used mobile apps more than desktop 
computers to access the Internet. The time 
U.S. adults are spending using mobile apps has 
exploded, growing by over 110% over the past 
three years, and now accounting for 58% of total 
digital media time spent; time spent on the desktop 
now accounts for just 33%, and mobile browsers 
just 9%. U.S. adults are spending over 96 hours 
a month (about 3¼ hours a day) within apps on 
their smartphones and tablet computers. Consum-
ers have gravitated to apps for several reasons. 
First, smartphones and tablet computers enable 
users to use apps anywhere, instead of being teth-
ered to a desktop or having to lug a heavy laptop 
around. Of course, smartphones and tablets enable 
users to use the Web too, but apps are often more 
convenient and boast more streamlined, elegant 
interfaces than mobile web browsers.
Not only are apps more appealing in certain 
ways to consumers, they are much more appealing 
to content creators and media companies. Apps 
are much easier to control and monetize than 
websites, not to mention they can’t be crawled by 
Google or other services. On the Web, the average 
price of ads per thousand impressions is falling, 
and many content providers are still mostly strug-
gling to turn the Internet into a profitable content 
delivery platform. Much of software and media 
companies’ focus has shifted to developing mobile 
apps for this reason.

These trends are why some pundits 
boldly proclaim that the Web is dead, and that 
the shift from the Web to apps has only just 
started. These analysts believe that the Internet 
will be used to transport data, but individual app 
interfaces will replace the web browser as the 
most common way to access and display content. 
Even the creator of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee, 
feels that the Web as we know it is being threat-
ened. That’s not a good sign. 
But there is no predictive consensus about 
the role of the Web in our lives in the next decade 
and beyond. Many analysts believe the demise of 
the Web has been greatly exaggerated, and that 
the Web boasts many advantages over today’s 
apps that users will be unwilling to relinquish. 
Although apps may be more convenient than 
the Web in many respects, the depth of the web 
browsing experience trumps that of apps. The Web 
is a vibrant, diverse array of sites, and browsers 
have an openness and flexibility that apps lack. 
The connections between websites enhance their 
usefulness and value to users, and apps that 
instead seek to lock users in cannot offer the same 
experience.
Other analysts who are more optimistic 
about the Web’s chances to remain relevant in an 
increasingly app-driven online marketplace feel 
this way because of the emergence of HTML5. 
HTML5 is a markup language that enables more 
dynamic web content and allows for browser-
accessible web apps that are as appealing as 
device-specific apps. In fact, there is another 
group of analysts who believe that apps and the 
Web are going to come together, with HTML5 
bringing the best of the app experience to the 
Web, and with apps developing new web-like 
capabilities. Already, work is underway to create 
more “smart” apps that handle a wider array of 
tasks than today’s apps can handle, such as apps 
with Siri integration.
A shift towards apps and away from the Web 
could have a ripple effect on e-commerce firms. As 
the pioneer of apps and the market leader in apps, 
smartphones, and tablet computers, Apple stands 
to gain from a shift towards apps, and although it 
also faces increasing competition from other com-
panies, including Google, the established success 
of the App Store will make it next to impossible 
to dethrone Apple. For instance, while Google’s 
Google Play store had double the number of down-
loads compared to Apple’s App Store in 2015, 
the App Store still made 75% more revenue than 
Google Play. Google’s search business is likely to 
suffer from all of the “walled garden” apps that 
it cannot access, but it also has a major stake in 
the world of smartphones, tablets, and apps itself 
with its Android operating system, which is used 
by over 80% of smartphones worldwide. Facebook 
has already seen its members make the transi-
tion from using its website to using its mobile app 
and has made, and continues to make, significant 
investments in standalone apps, such as Instagram 
and WhatsApp. Web-based companies that fail to 
find an answer to the growth of mobile apps may 
eventually fall by the wayside.

MAJOR TRENDS IN E-COMMERCE
Table 1.1 describes the major trends in e-commerce in 2016–2017 from a business, 
technological, and societal perspective, the three major organizing themes that we 
use in this book to understand e-commerce (see Section 1.6). 
From a business perspective, one of the most important trends to note is that all 
forms of e-commerce continue to show very strong growth. Retail e-commerce has 
been growing at double-digit rates for the last few years, and by 2017, is expected 
to reach $460 billion, while mobile e-commerce is anticipated to increase by almost 
30% to around $232 billion. Social networks such as Facebook, Pinterest, and Ins-
tagram are enabling social e-commerce by providing advertising, search, and Buy 
buttons that enable consumers to actually purchase products. Local e-commerce 
is being fueled by the explosion of interest in on-demand services such as Uber 
and Airbnb. B2B e-commerce, which dwarfs all other forms, also is continuing to 
strengthen and grow. 
From a technology perspective, the mobile platform based on smartphones and 
tablet computers has finally arrived with a bang, driving astronomical growth in 
mobile advertising and making true mobile e-commerce a reality. The use of mobile 
messaging services such as WhatsApp and Snapchat has created an alternative 
communications platform that are beginning to be leveraged for commerce as well. 
Cloud computing is inextricably linked to the development of the mobile platform 
by enabling the storage of consumer content and software on cloud (Internet-based) 
servers, and making it available to mobile devices as well as desktops. Other major 
technological trends include the increasing ability of companies to track and analyze 
the flood of online data (typically referred to as big data) being produced. The 
Internet of Things, comprised of billions of Internet-connected devices, continues 
to grow exponentially, and will only add to this flood of data in the years to come. 
At the societal level, other trends are apparent. The Internet and mobile plat-
form provide an environment that allows millions of people to create and share 
content, establish new social bonds, and strengthen existing ones through social 
network, photo- and video-posting, and blogging sites and apps, while at the same 
time creating significant privacy issues. Privacy seems to have lost some of its 
meaning in an age when millions create public online personal profiles, while at the 
same time concerns over commercial and governmental privacy invasion continue 
to increase. The major digital copyright owners have increased their pursuit of 
online piracy with mixed success, while reaching agreements with the big technol-
ogy players such as Apple, Amazon, and Google to protect intellectual property 
rights. Governments have successfully moved toward taxation of e-commerce sales. 
Sovereign nations have expanded their surveillance of, and control over, online 
communications and content as a part of their anti-terrorist activities and their 
traditional interest in law enforcement. Online security, or lack thereof, remains 
a significant issue, as new stories about security breaches, malware, hacking, and 
other attacks emerge seemingly daily.

UNIQUE FEATURES OF E-COMMERCE TECHNOLOGY
Figure 1.4 illustrates eight unique features of e-commerce technology that both chal-
lenge traditional business thinking and help explain why we have so much interest in 
e-commerce. These unique dimensions of e-commerce technologies suggest many new 
possibilities for marketing and selling—a powerful set of interactive, personalized, and 
rich messages are available for delivery to segmented, targeted audiences.
Prior to the development of e-commerce, the marketing and sale of goods was a 
mass-marketing and salesforce–driven process. Marketers viewed consumers as 
passive targets of advertising campaigns and branding “blitzes” intended to influence 
their long-term product perceptions and immediate purchasing behavior. Companies 
sold their products via well-insulated channels. Consumers were trapped by geographi-
cal and social boundaries, unable to search widely for the best price and quality. 
Information about prices, costs, and fees could be hidden from the consumer, creating 
profitable information asymmetries for the selling firm. Information asymmetry 
refers to any disparity in relevant market information among parties in a transaction. 
It was so expensive to change national or regional prices in traditional retailing (what 
are called menu costs) that one national price was the norm, and dynamic pricing to

EIGHT UNIQUE FEATURES OF E-COMMERCE TECHNOLOGY
E-commerce technologies provide a number of unique features that have impacted the conduct of business.

C H A P T E R  1     T h e  R e v o l u t i o n  I s  J u s t  B e g i n n i n g
the marketplace (changing prices in real time) was unheard of. In this environment, 
manufacturers prospered by relying on huge production runs of products that could 
not be customized or personalized.
E-commerce technologies make it possible for merchants to know much more 
about consumers and to be able to use this information more effectively than was ever 
true in the past. Online merchants can use this information to develop new informa-
tion asymmetries, enhance their ability to brand products, charge premium prices for 
high-quality service, and segment the market into an endless number of subgroups, 
each receiving a different price. To complicate matters further, these same technolo-
gies also make it possible for merchants to know more about other merchants than 
was ever true in the past. This presents the possibility that merchants might collude 
on prices rather than compete and drive overall average prices up. This strategy works 
especially well when there are just a few suppliers (Varian, 2000a). We examine these 
different visions of e-commerce further in Section 1.4 and throughout the book.
Each of the dimensions of e-commerce technology illustrated in Figure 1.4 
deserves a brief exploration, as well as a comparison to both traditional commerce 
and other forms of technology-enabled commerce.
UBIQUITY
In traditional commerce, a marketplace is a physical place you visit in order to 
transact. For example, television and radio typically motivate the consumer to go 
someplace to make a purchase. E-commerce, in contrast, is characterized by its 
u­biquity: it is available just about everywhere, at all times. It liberates the market 
from being restricted to a physical space and makes it possible to shop from your 
desktop, at home, at work, or even from your car, using mobile e-commerce. The result 
is called a marketspace—a marketplace extended beyond traditional boundaries and 
removed from a temporal and geographic location. 
From a consumer point of view, ubiquity reduces transaction costs—the costs of 
participating in a market. To transact, it is no longer necessary that you spend time and 
money traveling to a market. At a broader level, the ubiquity of e-commerce lowers 
the cognitive energy required to transact in a marketspace. Cognitive energy refers 
to the mental effort required to complete a task. Humans generally seek to reduce 
cognitive energy outlays. When given a choice, humans will choose the path requiring 
the least effort—the most convenient path (Shapiro and Varian, 1999; Tversky and 
Kahneman, 1981).
GLOBAL REACH
E-commerce technology permits commercial transactions to cross cultural, regional, 
and national boundaries far more conveniently and cost-effectively than is true in 
traditional commerce. As a result, the potential market size for e-commerce mer-
chants is roughly equal to the size of the world’s online population (an estimated 3.3 
billion in 2016) (eMarketer, Inc., 2016d). More realistically, the Internet makes it 
much easier for startup e-commerce merchants within a single country to achieve a 
national audience than was ever possible in the past. The total number of users or

aries and removed from a

customers an e-commerce business can obtain is a measure of its reach (Evans and 
Wurster, 1997).
In contrast, most traditional commerce is local or regional—it involves local 
merchants or national merchants with local outlets. Television, radio stations, and 
newspapers, for instance, are primarily local and regional institutions with limited 
but powerful national networks that can attract a national audience. In contrast to 
e-commerce technology, these older commerce technologies do not easily cross 
national boundaries to a global audience.
UNIVERSAL STANDARDS
One strikingly unusual feature of e-commerce technologies is that the technical stan-
dards of the Internet, and therefore the technical standards for conducting e-commerce, 
are universal standards—they are shared by all nations around the world. In contrast, 
most traditional commerce technologies differ from one nation to the next. For 
instance, television and radio standards differ around the world, as does cell phone 
technology. 
The universal technical standards of e-commerce greatly lower market entry costs—
the cost merchants must pay just to bring their goods to market. At the same time, for 
consumers, universal standards reduce search costs—the effort required to find suitable 
products. And by creating a single, one-world marketspace, where prices and product 
descriptions can be inexpensively displayed for all to see, price discovery becomes 
simpler, faster, and more accurate (Banerjee et al., 2005; Bakos, 1997; Kambil, 1997). 
Users, both businesses and individuals, also experience network externalities—benefits 
that arise because everyone uses the same technology. With e-commerce technologies, 
it is possible for the first time in history to easily find many of the suppliers, prices, 
and delivery terms of a specific product anywhere in the world, and to view them in 
a coherent, comparative environment. Although this is not necessarily realistic today 
for all or even most products, it is a potential that will be exploited in the future.
RICHNESS
Information richness refers to the complexity and content of a message (Evans and 
Wurster, 1999). Traditional markets, national sales forces, and retail stores have great 
richness: they are able to provide personal, face-to-face service using aural and visual 
cues when making a sale. The richness of traditional markets makes them a powerful 
selling or commercial environment. Prior to the development of the Web, there was 
a trade-off between richness and reach: the larger the audience reached, the less rich 
the message. 
E-commerce technologies have the potential for offering considerably more infor-
mation richness than traditional media such as printing presses, radio, and television 
because they are interactive and can adjust the message to individual users. Chatting 
with an online sales person, for instance, comes very close to the customer experience 
in a small retail shop. The richness enabled by e-commerce technologies allows retail 
and service merchants to market and sell “complex” goods and services that heretofore 
required a face-to-face presentation by a sales force to a much larger audience.

INTERACTIVITY
Unlike any of the commercial technologies of the twentieth century, with the possible 
exception of the telephone, e-commerce technologies allow for interactivity, meaning 
they enable two-way communication between merchant and consumer and among 
consumers. Traditional television or radio, for instance, cannot ask viewers questions 
or enter into conversations with them, or request that customer information be entered 
into a form. 
Interactivity allows an online merchant to engage a consumer in ways similar to 
a face-to-face experience. Comment features, community forums, and social networks 
with social sharing functionality such as Like and Share buttons all enable consumers 
to actively interact with merchants and other users. Somewhat less obvious forms of 
interactivity include responsive design elements, such as websites that change format 
depending on what kind of device they are being viewed on, product images that 
change as a mouse hovers over them, the ability to zoom in or rotate images, forms 
that notify the user of a problem as they are being filled out, and search boxes that 
autofill as the user types.
INFORMATION DENSITY
E-commerce technologies vastly increase information density—the total amount 
and quality of information available to all market participants, consumers and mer-
chants alike. E-commerce technologies reduce information collection, storage, process-
ing, and communication costs. At the same time, these technologies greatly increase 
the currency, accuracy, and timeliness of information—making information more 
useful and important than ever. As a result, information becomes more plentiful, less 
expensive, and of higher quality.
A number of business consequences result from the growth in information 
density. One of the shifts that e-commerce is bringing about is a reduction in infor-
mation asymmetry among market participants (consumers and merchants). Prices 
and costs become more transparent. Price transparency refers to the ease with which 
consumers can find out the variety of prices in a market; cost transparency refers to 
the ability of consumers to discover the actual costs merchants pay for products. Pre-
venting consumers from learning about prices and costs becomes more difficult with 
e-commerce and, as a result, the entire marketplace potentially becomes more price 
competitive (Sinha, 2000). But there are advantages for merchants as well. Online mer-
chants can discover much more about consumers; this allows merchants to segment 
the market into groups willing to pay different prices and permits them to engage in 
price discrimination—selling the same goods, or nearly the same goods, to different 
targeted groups at different prices. For instance, an online merchant can discover a 
consumer’s avid interest in expensive exotic vacations, and then pitch expensive exotic 
vacation plans to that consumer at a premium price, knowing this person is willing 
to pay extra for such a vacation. At the same time, the online merchant can pitch the 
same vacation plan at a lower price to more price-sensitive consumers. Merchants 
also have enhanced abilities to differentiate their products in terms of cost, brand, 
and quality.

PERSONALIZATION AND CUSTOMIZATION
E-commerce technologies permit personalization: merchants can target their market-
ing messages to specific individuals by adjusting the message to a person’s name, 
interests, and past purchases. Today this is achieved in a few milliseconds and followed 
by an advertisement based on the consumer’s profile. The technology also permits 
customization—changing the delivered product or service based on a user’s prefer-
ences or prior behavior. Given the interactive nature of e-commerce technology, much 
information about the consumer can be gathered in the marketplace at the moment 
of purchase. 
With the increase in information density, a great deal of information about the 
consumer’s past purchases and behavior can be stored and used by online merchants. 
The result is a level of personalization and customization unthinkable with traditional 
commerce technologies. For instance, you may be able to shape what you see on 
television by selecting a channel, but you cannot change the contents of the channel 
you have chosen. In contrast, the online version of the Wall Street Journal allows you 
to select the type of news stories you want to see first, and gives you the opportunity 
to be alerted when certain events happen. Personalization and customization allow 
firms to precisely identify market segments and adjust their messages accordingly.
SOCIAL TECHNOLOGY: USER-GENERATED CONTENT AND SOCIAL 
NETWORKS
In a way quite different from all previous technologies, e-commerce technologies have 
evolved to be much more social by allowing users to create and share content with a 
worldwide community. Using these forms of communication, users are able to create 
new social networks and strengthen existing ones. 
All previous mass media in modern history, including the printing press, used 
a broadcast model (one-to-many): content is created in a central location by experts 
(professional writers, editors, directors, actors, and producers) and audiences are 
concentrated in huge aggregates to consume a standardized product. The telephone 
would appear to be an exception but it is not a mass communication technology. 
Instead the telephone is a one-to-one technology. E-commerce technologies have the 
potential to invert this standard media model by giving users the power to create and 
distribute content on a large scale, and permit users to program their own content 
consumption. E-commerce technologies provide a unique, many-to-many model of 
mass communication.
Table 1.2 provides a summary of each of the unique features of e-commerce technol-
ogy and their business significance.

by the nature of the market relationship—who is selling to whom. Mobile, social, and 
local e-commerce can be looked at as subsets of these types of e-commerce.
BUSINESS-TO-CONSUMER (B2C) E-COMMERCE
The most commonly discussed type of e-commerce is business-to-consumer (B2C) 
e-commerce, in which online businesses attempt to reach individual consumers. B2C 
e-commerce includes purchases of retail goods, travel and other types of services, and 
online content. Even though B2C is comparatively small (an estimated $600 billion in 
2016 in the United States), it has grown exponentially since 1995, and is the type of 
e-commerce that most consumers are likely to encounter (see Figure 1.5). 
Within the B2C category, there are many different types of business models. 
Chapter 2 has a detailed discussion of seven different B2C business models: online

Ubiquity—E-commerce technology is 
available everywhere: at work, at home, 
and elsewhere via mobile devices, 
anytime.
The marketplace is extended beyond traditional 
boundaries and is removed from a temporal and 
geographic location. “Marketspace” is created; 
shopping can take place anywhere. Customer 
convenience is enhanced, and shopping costs are 
reduced.
Global reach—The technology reaches 
across national boundaries, around the 
earth.
Commerce is enabled across cultural and national 
boundaries seamlessly and without modification. 
“Marketspace” includes potentially billions of 
consumers and millions of businesses worldwide.
Universal standards—There is one set 
of technology standards.
There is a common, inexpensive, global technology 
foundation for businesses to use.
Richness—Video, audio, and text 
messages are possible.
Video, audio, and text marketing messages are 
integrated into a single marketing message and 
consuming experience.
Interactivity—The technology works 
through interaction with the user.
Consumers are engaged in a dialog that dynamically 
adjusts the experience to the individual, and makes the 
consumer a co-participant in the process of delivering 
goods to the market.
Information density—The technology 
reduces information costs and raises 
quality.
Information processing, storage, and communication 
costs drop dramatically, while currency, accuracy, and 
timeliness improve greatly. Information becomes 
plentiful, cheap, and accurate.
Personalization/Customization—The 
technology allows personalized 
messages to be delivered to individuals 
as well as groups.
Personalization of marketing messages and 
customization of products and services are based on 
individual characteristics.
Social technology—User-generated 
content and social networks.
New online social and business models enable user 
content creation and distribution, and support social 
networks.

retailers, service providers, transaction brokers, content providers, community provid-
ers/social networks, market creators, and portals. Then, in Part 4, we look at each of 
these business models in action. In Chapter 9, we examine online retailers, service 
providers, including on-demand services, and transaction brokers. In Chapter 10, we 
focus on content providers. In Chapter 11, we look at community providers (social 
networks), market creators (auctions), and portals.
The data suggests that, over the next five years, B2C e-commerce in the United 
States will grow by over 10% annually. There is tremendous upside potential. Today, 
for instance, retail e-commerce (which currently comprises the lion’s share of B2C 
e-commerce revenues) is still a very small part (around 8%) of the overall $4.8 tril-
lion retail market in the United States. There is obviously much room to grow (see 
Figure 1.6). However, it’s not likely that B2C e-commerce revenues will continue to 
expand forever at current rates. As online sales become a larger percentage of all sales, 
online sales growth will likely eventually decline. However, this point still appears 
to be a long way off. Online content sales, everything from music, to video, medical 
information, games, and entertainment, have an even longer period to grow before 
they hit any ceiling effects.
BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS (B2B) E-COMMERCE
Business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, in which businesses focus on selling to 
other businesses, is the largest form of e-commerce, with around $6.7 trillion in 
business-to-business 
(B2B) e-commerce

In the early years, B2C e-commerce was doubling or tripling each year. Although B2C e-commerce growth in the 
United States slowed in 2008–2009 due to the economic recession, it resumed growing at about 13% in 2010 
and since then, has continued to grow at double-digit rates.

transactions in the United States in 2016 (see Figure 1.7). There is an estimated $14.5 
trillion in business-to-business exchanges of all kinds, online and offline, suggesting 
that B2B e-commerce has significant growth potential. The ultimate size of B2B 
e-commerce is potentially huge. 
There are two primary business models used within the B2B arena: Net mar-
ketplaces, which include e-distributors, e-procurement companies, exchanges and 
industry consortia, and private industrial networks. We review various B2B business 
models in Chapter 2 and examine them in further depth in Chapter 12.
CONSUMER-TO-CONSUMER (C2C) E-COMMERCE
Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-commerce provides a way for consumers to sell 
to each other, with the help of an online market maker (also called a platform pro-
vider) such as eBay or Etsy, the classifieds site Craigslist, or on-demand service com-
panies such as Airbnb and Uber. In C2C e-commerce, the consumer prepares the 
product for market, places the product for auction or sale, and relies on the market 
maker to provide catalog, search engine, and transaction-clearing capabilities so that 
products can be easily displayed, discovered, and paid for.
Given that in 2015, eBay by itself generated around $82 billion in gross merchan-
dise volume, it is probably safe to estimate that the size of the C2C market in 2016 is 
more than $100 billion (eBay, 2016).

MOBILE E-COMMERCE (M-COMMERCE)
Mobile e-commerce (m-commerce), refers to the use of mobile devices to enable 
online transactions. M-commerce involves the use of cellular and wireless networks 
to connect smartphones and tablet computers to the Internet. Once connected, mobile 
consumers can purchase products and services, make travel reservations, use an 
expanding variety of financial services, access online content, and much more. 
M-commerce purchases are expected to reach over $180 billion in 2016 and to 
grow rapidly in the United States over the next five years (see Figure 1.8). Factors 
that are driving the growth of m-commerce include the increasing amount of time 
consumers are spending using mobile devices, larger smartphone screen sizes, greater 
use of responsive design enabling e-commerce sites to be better optimized for mobile 
use and mobile checkout and payment, and enhanced mobile search functionality. 
(eMarketer, Inc., 2016g, 2016h).
SOCIAL E-COMMERCE
Social e-commerce is e-commerce that is enabled by social networks and online 
social relationships. The growth of social e-commerce is being driven by a number of 
factors, including the increasing popularity of social sign-on (signing onto websites 
using your Facebook or other social network ID), network notification (the sharing of 
approval or disapproval of products, services, and content), online collaborative 
mobile e-commerce

shopping tools, social search (recommendations from online trusted friends), and the 
increasing prevalence of integrated social commerce tools such as Buy buttons, Shop-
ping tabs, and virtual shops on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube, and other 
social network sites. 
Social e-commerce is still in its relative infancy, but in 2015, the top 500 retailers in 
Internet Retailer’s Social Media 500 earned about $3.9 billion from social e-commerce. 
Website traffic from social networks to the top 500 retailers also increased by almost 
20% in 2015 (Internet Retailer, 2016).
Social e-commerce is often intertwined with m-commerce, particularly as more 
and more social network users access those networks via mobile devices. A variation of 
social e-commerce known as conversational commerce leverages the mobile connection 
even further. Conversational commerce involves the use of mobile messaging apps 
such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Slack, and others as a vehicle for 
companies to engage with consumers. 
LOCAL E-COMMERCE
Local e-commerce, as its name suggests, is a form of e-commerce that is focused on 
engaging the consumer based on his or her current geographic location. Local mer-
chants use a variety of online marketing techniques to drive consumers to their stores.

next five years as consumers become more and more accustomed to using mobile devices to purchase products 
and services.

Local e-commerce is the third prong of the mobile, social, local e-commerce wave and, 
fueled by an explosion of interest in local on-demand services such as Uber, is expected 
to grow in the United States to over $40 billion in 2016.

E-COMMERCE: A BRIEF HISTORY
It is difficult to pinpoint just when e-commerce began. There were several precursors 
to e-commerce. In the late 1970s, a pharmaceutical firm named Baxter Healthcare 
initiated a primitive form of B2B e-commerce by using a telephone-based modem that 
permitted hospitals to reorder supplies from Baxter. This system was later expanded 
during the 1980s into a PC-based remote order entry system and was widely copied 
throughout the United States long before the Internet became a commercial environ-
ment. The 1980s saw the development of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standards 
that permitted firms to exchange commercial documents and conduct digital com-
mercial transactions across private networks.
B2B e-commerce dwarfs all other forms of e-commerce; mobile, social, and local e-commerce, although 
growing rapidly, are still relatively small in comparison to “traditional” e-commerce.

In the B2C arena, the first truly large-scale digitally enabled transaction system 
was the Minitel, a French videotext system that combined a telephone with an 8-inch 
screen. The Minitel was first introduced in 1981, and by the mid-1980s, more than 
3 million had been deployed, with more than 13,000 different services available, 
including ticket agencies, travel services, retail products, and online banking. The 
Minitel service continued in existence until December 31, 2006, when it was finally 
discontinued by its owner, France Telecom.
However, none of these precursor systems had the functionality of the Internet. 
Generally, when we think of e-commerce today, it is inextricably linked to the Inter-
net. For our purposes, we will say e-commerce begins in 1995, following the appear-
ance of the first banner advertisements placed by AT&T, Volvo, Sprint, and others on 
Hotwired in late October 1994, and the first sales of banner ad space by Netscape and 
Infoseek in early 1995. 
Although e-commerce is not very old, it already has a tumultuous history, which 
can be usefully divided into three periods: 1995–2000, the period of invention; 2001–
2006, the period of consolidation; and 2007–present, a period of reinvention with 
social, mobile, and local expansion. The following examines each of these periods 
briefly, while Figure 1.10 places them in context along a timeline. 
E-COMMERCE 1995–2000: INVENTION
The early years of e-commerce were a period of explosive growth and extraordinary 
innovation. During this Invention period, e-commerce meant selling retail goods, 
usually quite simple goods, on the Internet. There simply was not enough bandwidth 
for more complex products. Marketing was limited to unsophisticated static display 
ads and not very powerful search engines. The web policy of most large firms, if they 
had one at all, was to have a basic static website depicting their brands. The rapid

growth in e-commerce was fueled by over $125 billion in venture capital. This period 
of e-commerce came to a close in 2000 when stock market valuations plunged, with 
thousands of companies disappearing (the “dot-com crash”). 
The early years of e-commerce were also one of the most euphoric of times in 
American commercial history. It was also a time when key e-commerce concepts 
were developed. For computer scientists and information technologists, the early 
success of e-commerce was a powerful vindication of a set of information technolo-
gies that had developed over a period of 40 years—extending from the development 
of the early Internet, to the PC, to local area networks. The vision was of a universal 
communications and computing environment that everyone on Earth could access 
with cheap, inexpensive computers—a worldwide universe of knowledge stored on 
HTML pages created by hundreds of millions of individuals and thousands of librar-
ies, governments, and scientific institutes. Technologists celebrated the fact that the 
Internet was not controlled by anyone or any nation, but was free to all. They believed 
the Internet—and the e-commerce that rose on this infrastructure—should remain a 
self-governed, self-regulated environment.
For economists, the early years of e-commerce raised the realistic prospect of a 
nearly perfect competitive market: where price, cost, and quality information are 
equally distributed, a nearly infinite set of suppliers compete against one another, and 
customers have access to all relevant market information worldwide. The Internet 
would spawn digital markets where information would be nearly perfect—something 
that is rarely true in other real-world markets. Merchants in turn would have equal

C H A P T E R  1     T h e  R e v o l u t i o n  I s  J u s t  B e g i n n i n g
direct access to hundreds of millions of customers. In this near-perfect information 
marketspace, transaction costs would plummet because search costs—the cost of 
searching for prices, product descriptions, payment settlement, and order fulfillment—
would all fall drastically (Bakos, 1997). For merchants, the cost of searching for custom-
ers would also fall, reducing the need for wasteful advertising. At the same time, 
advertisements could be personalized to the needs of every customer. Prices and even 
costs would be increasingly transparent to the consumer, who could now know exactly 
and instantly the worldwide best price, quality, and availability of most products. 
Information asymmetry would be greatly reduced. Given the instant nature of Internet 
communications, the availability of powerful sales information systems, and the low 
cost involved in changing prices on a website (low menu costs), producers could 
dynamically price their products to reflect actual demand, ending the idea of one 
national price, or one suggested manufacturer’s list price. In turn, market middle-
men—the distributors and wholesalers who are intermediaries between producers and 
consumers, each demanding a payment and raising costs while adding little value—
would disappear (disintermediation). Manufacturers and content originators would 
develop direct market relationships with their customers. The resulting intense com-
petition, the decline of intermediaries, and the lower transaction costs would eliminate 
product brands, and along with these, the possibility of monopoly profits based on 
brands, geography, or special access to factors of production. Prices for products and 
services would fall to the point where prices covered costs of production plus a fair, 
“market rate” of return on capital, plus additional small payments for entrepreneurial 
effort (that would not last long). Unfair competitive advantages (which occur when 
one competitor has an advantage others cannot purchase) would be reduced, as would 
extraordinary returns on invested capital. This vision was called friction-free com-
merce (Smith et al., 2000).
For real-world entrepreneurs, their financial backers, and marketing professionals, 
e-commerce represented an extraordinary opportunity to earn far above normal 
returns on investment. This is just the opposite of what economists hoped for. The 
e-commerce marketspace represented access to millions of consumers worldwide who 
used the Internet and a set of marketing communications technologies (e-mail and 
web pages) that was universal, inexpensive, and powerful. These new technologies 
would permit marketers to practice what they always had done—segmenting the 
market into groups with different needs and price sensitivity, targeting the segments 
with branding and promotional messages, and positioning the product and pricing for 
each group—but with even more precision. In this new marketspace, extraordinary 
profits would go to first movers—those firms who were first to market in a particular 
area and who moved quickly to gather market share. In a “winner take all” market, 
first movers could establish a large customer base quickly, build brand name recogni-
tion early, create an entirely new distribution channel, and then inhibit competitors 
(new entrants) by building in switching costs for their customers through proprietary 
interface designs and features available only at one site. The idea for entrepreneurs 
was to create near monopolies online based on size, convenience, selection, and brand. 
Online businesses using the new technology could create informative, community-like 
features unavailable to traditional merchants. These “communities of consumption”

also would add value and be difficult for traditional merchants to imitate. The thinking 
was that once customers became accustomed to using a company’s unique web inter-
face and feature set, they could not easily be switched to competitors. In the best case, 
the entrepreneurial firm would invent proprietary technologies and techniques that 
almost everyone adopted, creating a network effect. A network effect occurs where 
all participants receive value from the fact that everyone else uses the same tool or 
product (for example, a common operating system, telephone system, or software 
application such as a proprietary instant messaging standard or an operating system 
such as Windows), all of which increase in value as more people adopt them.1
To initiate this process, entrepreneurs argued that prices would have to be very 
low to attract customers and fend off potential competitors. E-commerce was, after all, 
a totally new way of shopping that would have to offer some immediate cost benefits 
to consumers. However, because doing business on the Web was supposedly so much 
more efficient when compared to traditional “bricks-and-mortar” businesses (even 
when compared to the direct mail catalog business) and because the costs of customer 
acquisition and retention would supposedly be so much lower, profits would inevitably 
materialize out of these efficiencies. Given these dynamics, market share, the number 
of visitors to a site (“eyeballs”), and gross revenue became far more important in the 
earlier stages of an online firm than earnings or profits. Entrepreneurs and their 
financial backers in the early years of e-commerce expected that extraordinary profit-
ability would come, but only after several years of losses.
Thus, the early years of e-commerce were driven largely by visions of prof-
iting from new technology, with the emphasis on quickly achieving very high 
market visibility. The source of financing was venture capital funds. The ideology 
of the period emphasized the ungoverned “Wild West” character of the Web and 
the feeling that governments and courts could not possibly limit or regulate the 
Internet; there was a general belief that traditional corporations were too slow and 
bureaucratic, too stuck in the old ways of doing business, to “get it”—to be competi-
tive in e-commerce. Young entrepreneurs were therefore the driving force behind 
e-commerce, backed by huge amounts of money invested by venture capitalists. 
The emphasis was on disrupting (destroying) traditional distribution channels and 
disintermediating existing channels, using new pure online companies who aimed 
to achieve impregnable first-mover advantages. Overall, this period of e-commerce 
was characterized by experimentation, capitalization, and hypercompetition 
(Varian, 2000b).
E-COMMERCE 2001–2006: CONSOLIDATION
In the second period of e-commerce, from 2000 to 2006, a sobering period of reassess-
ment of e-commerce occurred, with many critics doubting its long-term prospects. 
Emphasis shifted to a more “business-driven” approach rather than being technology 
driven; large traditional firms learned how to use the Web to strengthen their market 
positions; brand extension and strengthening became more important than creating

new brands; financing shrunk as capital markets shunned startup firms; and traditional 
bank financing based on profitability returned. 
During this period of consolidation, e-commerce changed to include not just 
retail products but also more complex services such as travel and financial services. 
This period was enabled by widespread adoption of broadband networks in American 
homes and businesses, coupled with the growing power and lower prices of personal 
computers that were the primary means of accessing the Internet, usually from work 
or home. Marketing on the Internet increasingly meant using search engine advertis-
ing targeted to user queries, rich media and video ads, and behavioral targeting of 
marketing messages based on ad networks and auction markets. The web policy of 
both large and small firms expanded to include a broader “web presence” that included 
not just websites, but also e-mail, display, and search engine campaigns; multiple 
websites for each product; and the building of some limited community feedback 
facilities. E-commerce in this period was growing again by more than 10% a year. 
E-COMMERCE 2007–PRESENT: REINVENTION
Beginning in 2007 with the introduction of the iPhone, to the present day, e-commerce 
has been transformed yet again by the rapid growth of Web 2.0 (a set of applications 
and technologies that enable user-generated content, such as online social networks, 
blogs, video and photo sharing sites, and wikis), widespread adoption of mobile devices 
such as smartphones and tablet computers, the expansion of e-commerce to include 
local goods and services, and the emergence of an on-demand service economy 
enabled by millions of apps on mobile devices and cloud computing. This period can 
be seen as both a sociological, as well as a technological and business, phenomenon.
The defining characteristics of this period are often characterized as the “social, 
mobile, local” online world. Entertainment content has developed as a major source 
of e-commerce revenues and mobile devices have become entertainment centers, as 
well as on-the-go shopping devices for retail goods and services. Marketing has been 
transformed by the increasing use of social networks, word-of-mouth, viral marketing, 
and much more powerful data repositories and analytic tools for truly personal mar-
keting. Firms have greatly expanded their online presence by moving beyond static 
web pages to social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram in 
an attempt to surround the online consumer with coordinated marketing messages. 
These social networks share many common characteristics. First, they rely on user-
generated content. “Regular” people (not just experts or professionals) are creating, 
sharing, and broadcasting content to huge audiences. They are inherently highly 
interactive, creating new opportunities for people to socially connect to others. They 
attract extremely large audiences (about 1.7 billion monthly active users worldwide 
as of June 2016 in the case of Facebook). These audiences present marketers with 
extraordinary opportunities for targeted marketing and advertising. 
More recently, the reinvention of e-commerce has resulted in a new set of on-
demand, personal service businesses such as Uber, Airbnb, Instacart, and Handy. 
These businesses have been able to tap into a large reservoir of unused assets (cars, 
spare rooms, and personal spare time) and to create lucrative markets based on the 
mobile platform infrastructure. The Insight on Business case, Startup Boot Camp, takes

ASSESSING E-COMMERCE: SUCCESSES, SURPRISES, AND FAILURES
Looking back at the evolution of e-commerce, it is apparent that e-commerce has been 
a stunning technological success as the Internet and the Web ramped up from a few 
thousand to billions of e-commerce transactions per year, and this year will gener-
ate an estimated $600 billion in total B2C revenues and around $6.7 trillion in B2B 
revenues, with around 177 million online buyers in the United States. With enhance-
ments and strengthening, described in later chapters, it is clear that e-commerce’s 
digital infrastructure is solid enough to sustain significant growth in e-commerce 
during the next decade. The Internet scales well. The “e” in e-commerce has been an 
overwhelming success.
From a business perspective, though, the early years of e-commerce were a mixed 
success, and offered many surprises. Only a very small percentage of dot-coms formed

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
STARTUP BOOT CAMP
By now we’ve all heard the story of 
some lines of code written by Mark 
Zuckerberg in a Harvard dorm room 
blossoming into a multi-billion dollar 
business. These days, it’s harder than ever 
to keep track of all the tech start-ups being 
valued at millions and even billions of dollars, 
often even without a cent of revenue to show for 
themselves. A number of them have something in 
common—they have been nurtured, and in some 
cases, whipped into shape, with the help of an 
“incubator.”
As entrepreneurs continue to launch a growing 
number of e-commerce companies, incubators have 
come to occupy a vital role in Silicon Valley, helping 
new businesses move from little more than a great 
idea to an established, vibrant business. Founded in 
2005 by programmer and venture capitalist Paul 
Graham, Y Combinator (YC) is Silicon Valley’s best 
known incubator. Twice a year the company pro-
vides a three-month boot camp, complete with seed 
funding and mentorship from an extensive network 
of highly regarded tech entrepreneurs. Every boot 
camp ends with a demonstration day, known as 
Demo Day or D Day, where all of the entrepre-
neurs, known as “founders,” pitch their fledgling 
businesses to a group of wealthy venture capitalists 
hoping to unearth the next Facebook or Google. In 
2014, Graham stepped down from a leadership role 
at the company, replaced by Sam Altman, former 
CEO of Loopt, a location-based mobile services 
provider and a successful YC graduate company. 
Altman is aiming to expand YC’s focus beyond the 
Internet to energy, biotechnology, medical devices, 
and other “hard technology” startups that solve 
concrete problems. 
When companies are admitted to YC after 
a rigorous selection progress (typically less than 
2% of applicants are accepted), they are given 
$120,000 in cash in exchange for a 7% stake in 
the company. Founders have regular meetings with 
YC partners, and have free access to technology, 
technical advice, emotional support, and lessons in 
salesmanship. As of September 2016, Y Combinator 
has helped launch almost 1,400 start-up compa-
nies, which together have a market capitalization 
of more than $70 billion. Its graduates have raised 
more than $10 billion, and ten of them have attained 
once rare, but now increasingly common, “unicorn” 
status, with a valuation in excess of $1 billion. More 
than 50 are worth over $100 million. 
YC has been so successful that it is sometimes 
referred to as a “unicorn breeder.” Graduates that 
have achieved unicorn status include Airbnb, an 
on-demand room rental service (with a valuation 
of $30 billion); Dropbox, a cloud-based file storage 
service ($10 billion); Stripe, a digital payment 
infrastructure company ($5 billion); MZ (Machine 
Zone), a massively multi-player online gaming 
company ($3 billion); Zenefits, a cloud-based 
employee benefits manager ($2 billion); Instacart, 
an on-demand grocery delivery service ($2 billion); 
Twitch, a streaming video game network (acquired 
by Amazon for $1 billion); Docker, an open source 
software company ($1 billion), and Cruise, which 
develops self-driving car technology (acquired by 
GM for $ 1 billion). Other well-known graduates 
include Reddit, a social news site; Weebly, a website 
building platform; Coinbase, a Bitcoin wallet; Scribd, 
a digital library subscription service; and Codecad-
emy, an online education service that teaches people 
how to program.
YC’s Winter 2016 class featured 127 startups 
that launched during its March 2016 Demo Days. 
While YC is increasingly focused on startups that 
are aiming to solve pervasive problems in the world 
rather than the next big gaming or to-do list app, it 
still accepts a number of startups seeking to make 
their mark in the e-commerce arena. For instance, 
Restocks is a mobile app that helps consumers

track and buy hard-to-find, limited release prod-
ucts. Subscribers to Restocks’ service receive push 
notification when brands such as Nike release or 
restock those products. Restocks had its genesis in 
founder Luke Miles’ frustration with his inability 
to find and purchase some “hot” Supreme-brand 
t-shirts. Miles wrote some code that sent him an 
e-mail when the products showed up as restocked on 
the brand’s website and then realized that it could 
be a useful tool for other products as well. Although 
Restocks faces competition from individual brands 
that may offer apps with a similar functionality, 
such as Nike’s SNKRs app, Restocks differentiates 
itself by aggregating dozens of brands. 
Among other startups from the Winter 2016 
class tabbed by analysts as particularly promising 
were Cover (an app that enables users to obtain 
insurance just by taking a photo), Castle.io (behav-
ior-based online security), Yardbook (a cloud soft-
ware system for the landscaping industry), Mux (a 
Netflix-like streaming service for business looking 
to deliver online video to customers), and Chatfuel 
(an automated chat tool for WhatsApp and other 
platforms). 
YC also accepts startups that are focused on 
markets outside the United States. The Winter 2016 
class included Paystack, an online payments pro-
vider for African businesses; Kisan Network, which 
provides an online marketplace in India for farmers 
to sell directly to institutional buyers; Rappi, an 
on-demand service company focused on grocery 
delivery in Colombia; Shypmate, which offers a 
platform to facilitate person-to-person shipping to 
Africa; Lynks, an e-commerce logistics infrastruc-
ture company for countries that are less developed; 
and GoLorry, a mobile app that provides 
trucking logistics in India.
Not every company that makes it through 
YC’s boot camp is successful. Companies that fail 
to attract sufficient investor interest at Demo Day 
can try again with a different company or go their 
own way and “grow organically.” Some skeptics 
believe that incubators like YC might not be the 
best idea for every startup. For startups with solid, 
but not eye-popping products, services, or growth 
metrics, YC’s D Day might actually hurt their 
chances of getting funding. Having to compete 
against an extremely qualified field of startup 
companies diminishes the appeal for less flashy 
businesses. Once you’ve failed at acquiring funding 
at YC, other prospective investors might become 
concerned. There is also the concern founders may 
fixate on raising more money in seed funding rounds 
than necessary. According to Altman, founders 
should initially focus on making their company work 
on as little capital as possible, and YC’s best com-
panies have been able to make great strides even 
with just relatively small amounts of seed funding. 
As part of its own continuing evolution, YC 
announced in 2015 that it would begin to make 
later-stage investments in its graduates as well. 
Together with Stanford University’s endowment fund 
and Willett Advisors, YC has created a new $700 
million Continuity Fund. YC has said that it hopes 
to participate in later funding rounds for all of its 
graduates that are being valued in funding at $300 
million or less to help further guide them as they 
mature. In 2016, background screening software 
maker Checkr was one of the first to benefit, raising 
$40 million in funding led by the Continuity Fund.

since 1995 have survived as independent companies in 2016, and even fewer of these 
survivors are profitable. Yet online retail sales of goods and services are still growing 
very rapidly. Contrary to economists’ hopes, however, online sales are increasingly 
concentrated. For instance, according to Internet Retailer, the top 500 retailers account 
for 84% of all online retail sales (Internet Retailer, 2016). So thousands of firms have 
failed, and those few that have survived dominate the market. The idea of thousands of 
suppliers competing on price has been replaced by a market dominated by giant firms. 
Consumers use the Web as a powerful source of information about products they often 
actually purchase through other channels, such as at a traditional bricks-and-mortar 
store. For instance, a 2014 study found that almost 90% of those surveyed “webroomed” 
(researched a product online before purchasing at a physical store) (Interactions 
Consumer Experience Marketing, Inc., 2014). This is especially true of expensive 
consumer durables such as automobiles, appliances, and electronics. This offline 
“Internet-influenced” commerce is very difficult to estimate, but definitely significant. 
For instance, Forrester Research estimated the amount to be somewhere around $1.3 
trillion in 2015 (Forrester Research, 2016). All together then, retail e-commerce (actual 
online purchases) and purchases influenced by online shopping but actually bought in 
a store (Internet-influenced commerce) are expected to amount to almost $1.7 trillion 
in 2016. The “commerce” in e-commerce is basically very sound, at least in the sense 
of attracting a growing number of customers and generating revenues and profits for 
large e-commerce players. 
Although e-commerce has grown at an extremely rapid pace in customers and 
revenues, it is clear that many of the visions, predictions, and assertions about e-com-
merce developed in the early years have not been fulfilled. For instance, economists’ 
visions of “friction-free” commerce have not been entirely realized. Prices are some-
times lower online, but the low prices are sometimes a function of entrepreneurs 
selling products below their costs. In some cases, online prices are higher than those 
of local merchants, as consumers are willing to pay a small premium for the con-
venience of buying online (Cavallo, 2016). Consumers are less price sensitive than 
expected; surprisingly, the websites with the highest revenue often have the highest 
prices. There remains considerable persistent and even increasing price dispersion: 
online competition has lowered prices, but price dispersion remains pervasive in many 
markets despite lower search costs (Levin, 2011; Ghose and Yao, 2010). In a study of 
50,000 goods in the United Kingdom and the United States, researchers found Internet 
prices were sticky even in the face of large changes in demand, online merchants 
did not alter prices significantly more than offline merchants, and price dispersion 
across online sellers was somewhat greater than traditional brick and mortar stores 
(Gorodnichenko, et al., 2014). The concept of one world, one market, one price has not 
occurred in reality as entrepreneurs discover new ways to differentiate their products 
and services. Merchants have adjusted to the competitive Internet environment by 
engaging in “hit-and-run pricing” or changing prices every day or hour (using “flash 
pricing” or “flash sales”) so competitors never know what they are charging (neither do 
customers); by making their prices hard to discover and sowing confusion among con-
sumers by “baiting and switching” customers from low-margin products to high-margin 
products with supposedly “higher quality.” Finally, brands remain very important in 

	
E - c o m m e r c e :  A  B r i e f  H i s t o r y 	

37
e-commerce—consumers trust some firms more than others to deliver a high-quality 
product on time and they are willing to pay for it (Rosso and Jansen, 2010).
The “perfect competition” model of extreme market efficiency has not come to 
pass. Merchants and marketers are continually introducing information asymmetries. 
Search costs have fallen overall, but the overall transaction cost of actually completing 
a purchase in e-commerce remains high because users have a bewildering number 
of new questions to consider: Will the merchant actually deliver? What is the time 
frame of delivery? Does the merchant really stock this item? How do I fill out this 
form? Many potential e-commerce purchases are terminated in the shopping cart 
stage because of these consumer uncertainties. Some people still find it easier to call 
a trusted catalog merchant on the telephone than to order on a website. Finally, inter-
mediaries have not disappeared as predicted. Most manufacturers, for instance, have 
not adopted the manufacturer-direct sales model of online sales, and some that had, 
such as Sony, have returned to an intermediary model. Dell, one of the pioneers of 
online manufacturer-direct sales, has moved toward a mixed model heavily reliant on 
in-store sales where customers can “kick the tires;” Apple’s physical stores are among 
the most successful stores in the world. People still like to shop in a physical store.
If anything, e-commerce has created many opportunities for middlemen to aggre-
gate content, products, and services and thereby introduce themselves as the “new” 
intermediaries. Third-party travel sites such as Travelocity, Orbitz, and Expedia are 
an example of this kind of intermediary. E-commerce has not driven existing retail 
chains and catalog merchants out of business, although it has created opportunities 
for entrepreneurial online-only firms to succeed.
The visions of many entrepreneurs and venture capitalists for e-commerce have 
not materialized exactly as predicted either. First-mover advantage appears to have 
succeeded only for a very small group of companies, albeit some of them extremely 
well-known, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and others. Getting big fast sometimes 
works, but often not. Historically, first movers have been long-term losers, with the 
early-to-market innovators usually being displaced by established “fast-follower” firms 
with the right complement of financial, marketing, legal, and production assets needed 
to develop mature markets, and this has proved true for e-commerce as well. Many 
e-commerce first movers, such as eToys, FogDog (sporting goods), Webvan (grocer-
ies), and Eve.com (beauty products), failed. Customer acquisition and retention costs 
during the early years of e-commerce were extraordinarily high, with some firms, 
such as E*Trade and other financial service firms, paying up to $400 to acquire a new 
customer. The overall costs of doing business online—including the costs of technol-
ogy, site design and maintenance, and warehouses for fulfillment—are often no lower 
than the costs faced by the most efficient bricks-and-mortar stores. A large warehouse 
costs tens of millions of dollars regardless of a firm’s online presence. The knowledge 
of how to run the warehouse is priceless, and not easily moved. The startup costs can 
be staggering. Attempting to achieve or enhance profitability by raising prices has 
often led to large customer defections. From the e-commerce merchant’s perspective, 
the “e” in e-commerce does not stand for “easy.”
On the other hand, there have been some extraordinary and unanticipated 
surprises in the evolution of e-commerce. Few predicted the impact of the mobile

platform. Few anticipated the rapid growth of social networks or their growing success 
as advertising platforms based on a more detailed understanding of personal behavior 
than even Google has achieved. And few, if any, anticipated the emergence of on-
demand e-commerce, which enables people to use their mobile devices to order up 
everything from taxis, to groceries, to laundry service.

UNDERSTANDING E-COMMERCE: ORGANIZING THEMES
Understanding e-commerce in its totality is a difficult task for students and instructors 
because there are so many facets to the phenomenon. No single academic discipline 
is prepared to encompass all of e-commerce. After teaching the e-commerce course 
for a number of years and writing this book, we have come to realize just how difficult 
it is to “understand” e-commerce. We have found it useful to think about e-commerce 
as involving three broad interrelated themes: technology, business, and society. We 
do not mean to imply any ordering of importance here because this book and our 
thinking freely range over these themes as appropriate to the problem we are trying 
to understand and describe. Nevertheless, as in previous technologically driven com-
mercial revolutions, there is a historic progression. Technologies develop first, and 
then those developments are exploited commercially. Once commercial exploitation 
of the technology becomes widespread, a host of social, cultural, and political issues 
arise, and society is forced to respond to them.
TECHNOLOGY: INFRASTRUCTURE
The development and mastery of digital computing and communications technology 
is at the heart of the newly emerging global digital economy we call e-commerce. 
To understand the likely future of e-commerce, you need a basic understanding of 
the information technologies upon which it is built. E-commerce is above all else a 
technologically driven phenomenon that relies on a host of information technologies 
as well as fundamental concepts from computer science developed over a 50-year 
period. At the core of e-commerce are the Internet and the Web, which we describe 
in detail in Chapter 3. Underlying these technologies are a host of complementary 
technologies: cloud computing, desktop computers, smartphones, tablet computers, 
local area networks, relational and non-relational databases, client/server computing, 
data mining, and fiber-optic switches, to name just a few. These technologies lie at 
the heart of sophisticated business computing applications such as enterprise-wide 
information systems, supply chain management systems, manufacturing resource 
planning systems, and customer relationship management systems. E-commerce relies 
on all these basic technologies—not just the Internet. The Internet, while representing 
a sharp break from prior corporate computing and communications technologies, is 
nevertheless just the latest development in the evolution of corporate computing and 
part of the continuing chain of computer-based innovations in business. Figure 1.11 
illustrates the major stages in the development of corporate computing and indicates 
how the Internet and the Web fit into this development trajectory.

To truly understand e-commerce, you will need to know something about packet-
switched communications, protocols such as TCP/IP, client/server and cloud comput-
ing, mobile digital platforms, web servers, HTML5, CSS, and software programming 
tools such as Flash and JavaScript on the client side, and Java, PHP, Ruby on Rails, 
and ColdFusion on the server side. All of these topics are described fully in Part 2 of 
the book (Chapters 3–5).

BUSINESS: BASIC CONCEPTS
While technology provides the infrastructure, it is the business applications—the 
potential for extraordinary returns on investment—that create the interest and excite-
ment in e-commerce. New technologies present businesses and entrepreneurs with 
new ways of organizing production and transacting business. New technologies change 
the strategies and plans of existing firms: old strategies are made obsolete and new 
ones need to be invented. New technologies are the birthing grounds where thousands 
of new companies spring up with new products and services. New technologies are 
the graveyard of many traditional businesses. To truly understand e-commerce, you 
will need to be familiar with some key business concepts, such as the nature of digital 
markets, digital goods, business models, firm and industry value chains, value webs, 
industry structure, digital disruption, and consumer behavior in digital markets, as 
well as basic concepts of financial analysis. We’ll examine these concepts further in 
Chapters 2, 6, 7, and 9 through 12.
SOCIETY: TAMING THE JUGGERNAUT
With around 267 million Americans now using the Internet, many for e-commerce 
purposes, and more than 3.3 billion users worldwide, the impact of the Internet and 
e-commerce on society is significant and global. Increasingly, e-commerce is subject 
to the laws of nations and global entities. You will need to understand the pressures 
that global e-commerce places on contemporary society in order to conduct a success-
ful e-commerce business or understand the e-commerce phenomenon. The primary 
societal issues we discuss in this book are individual privacy, intellectual property, 
and public welfare policy.
Because the Internet and the Web are exceptionally adept at tracking the iden-
tity and behavior of individuals online, e-commerce raises difficulties for preserving 
privacy—the ability of individuals to place limits on the type and amount of informa-
tion collected about them, and to control the uses of their personal information. Read 
the Insight on Society case, Facebook and the Age of Privacy, to get a view of some of the 
ways e-commerce sites use personal information.
Because the cost of distributing digital copies of copyrighted intellectual prop-
erty—tangible works of the mind such as music, books, and videos—is nearly zero on 
the Internet, e-commerce poses special challenges to the various methods societies 
have used in the past to protect intellectual property rights.
The global nature of e-commerce also poses public policy issues of equity, equal 
access, content regulation, and taxation. For instance, in the United States, public 
telephone utilities are required under public utility and public accommodation laws 
to make basic service available at affordable rates so everyone can have telephone 
service. Should these laws be extended to the Internet and the Web? If goods are 
purchased by a New York State resident from a website in California, shipped from 
a center in Illinois, and delivered to New York, what state has the right to collect a 
sales tax? Should some heavy Internet users who consume extraordinary amounts 
of bandwidth by streaming endless movies be charged extra for service, or should 
the Internet be neutral with respect to usage? What rights do nation-states and their

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY 
FACEBOOK AND THE AGE OF PRIVACY
In a January 2010 interview, Mark 
Zuckerberg, the founder of Face-
book, proclaimed that the age of 
privacy had to come to an end. Accord-
ing to Zuckerberg, people were no longer 
worried about sharing their personal infor-
mation with friends, friends of friends, or even the 
entire Web. Supporters of Zuckerberg’s viewpoint 
believe the twenty-first century is a new era of 
openness and transparency. If true, this is good 
news for Facebook because its business model is 
based on selling access to a database of personal 
information. 
However, not everyone is a true believer. 
Privacy—limitations on what personal informa-
tion government and private institutions can 
collect and use—is a founding principle of democ-
racies. A decade’s worth of privacy surveys in the 
United States show that well over 80% of the 
American public fear the Internet is a threat to 
their privacy.
With about 1.7 billion monthly users world-
wide, and around 175 million in North America, 
Facebook’s privacy policies are going to shape 
privacy standards on the Internet for years to 
come. The economic stakes in the privacy debate 
are quite high, involving billions in advertising and 
transaction dollars. Facebook’s business model is 
based on building a database of billions of users 
who are encouraged, or even perhaps deceived, 
into relinquishing control over personal informa-
tion, which is then sold to advertisers and other 
third parties. The less privacy Facebook’s users 
want or have, the more Facebook profits. Elimi-
nating personal information privacy is built into 
Facebook’s DNA.
Facebook’s current privacy policies are 
quite a flip-flop from its original policy in 2004, 
which promised users near complete control over 
who could see their personal profile. However, 
every year since 2004, Facebook has attempted 
to extend its control over user information and 
content, often without notice. For instance, in 
2007, Facebook introduced the Beacon program, 
which was designed to broadcast users’ activities 
on participating websites to their friends. After a 
public outcry, Facebook terminated the Beacon 
program, and paid $9.5 million to settle a host 
of class action lawsuits. In 2009, undeterred by 
the Beacon fiasco, Facebook unilaterally decided 
that it would publish users’ basic personal infor-
mation on the public Internet, and announced that 
whatever content users had contributed belonged 
to Facebook, and that its ownership of that 
information never terminated. However, as with 
the Beacon program, Facebook’s efforts to take 
permanent control of user information resulted in 
users joining online resistance groups and it was 
ultimately forced to withdraw this policy as well.
In 2011, Facebook began publicizing users’ 
“likes” of various advertisers in Sponsored Stories 
(i.e., advertisements) that included the users’ 
names and profile pictures without their explicit 
consent, without paying them, and without giving 
them a way to opt out. This resulted in yet another 
class action lawsuit, which Facebook settled for 
$20 million in June 2012. (Facebook dropped 
Sponsored Stories in April 2014.) In 2011, Face-
book enrolled all Facebook subscribers into its 
facial recognition program without notice. This 
too raised the privacy alarm, forcing Facebook to 
make it easier for users to opt out. 
In May 2012, Facebook went public, creating 
even more pressure to increase revenues and profits 
to justify its stock market value. Shortly thereaf-
ter, Facebook announced that it was launching a 
mobile advertising product that pushes ads to the 
mobile news feeds of users based on the apps they 
use through the Facebook Connect feature, without 
explicit permission from the user to do so. It also 

42	
	
C H A P T E R  1     T h e  R e v o l u t i o n  I s  J u s t  B e g i n n i n g
announced Facebook Exchange, a program 
that allows advertisers to serve ads to Face-
book users based on their browsing activity while 
not on Facebook. Privacy advocates raised the 
alarm yet again and more lawsuits were filed by 
users. In 2013, Facebook agreed to partner with 
several data marketing companies that deliver tar-
geted ads based on offline data. The firms provide 
customer data to Facebook, which then allows 
Facebook advertisers to target their ads to those 
users based on that data. 
In December 2013, another class action 
lawsuit was filed against Facebook by users alleg-
ing that it violated their privacy by scanning users’ 
private Facebook messages and mining them for 
data such as references to URLs that Facebook 
could then sell to advertisers. In May 2014, an 
enhancement to Facebook’s mobile app that allows 
the app to recognize the music, television show, 
or movie playing in the background when a user 
makes a status update raised a new privacy alarm. 
Facebook’s newest privacy issue involves its 
facial recognition software used to tag users in 
photos. The “tag suggestions” feature is auto-
matically enabled when you sign up, without user 
consent. A federal court in 2016 is allowing a 
lawsuit to go forward contesting Facebook’s right 
to tag users in photos without their consent. This 
feature appears to be in violation of several state 
laws which seek to secure the privacy of biometric 
data. 
After all these lawsuits and online public 
protests, one might think that Facebook’s privacy 
policy would improve. But an academic analysis 
of Facebook’s privacy policies from 2008 to 2015 
found that on most measures of privacy protec-
tion, Facebook’s policies have worsened. Since 
2008, Facebook has made it more difficult for 
users to find out what information is being shared 
with whom, how it builds profiles, or how to 
change privacy settings. Its privacy policies have 
become less readable, even inscrutable, according 
to the researchers.
Facebook is certainly aware of consumer 
suspicion of its privacy policies, and it changes 
its policies almost yearly in response to criticism. 
But the response is often not helpful for users, 
and typically extends the company’s claims to do 
whatever it wants with personal information. Its 
latest privacy policy, implemented in 2015, claims 
to switch its default privacy settings for new 
users from Public to Friends, provide a Privacy 
Checkup tool for users, give users the ability to 
see the data it keeps on their likes and interests, 
and enable users to change, delete, or add to that 
data. Facebook argues this new policy gives users 
more control of the ads they are shown. Analysts 
point out, however, that using these new features 
requires users to navigate a maze of check boxes 
and menus that are difficult to understand even for 
expert Facebook users. Users have come to realize 
that everything they post or say on Facebook will 
be given over to advertisers. There is no privacy on 
Facebook. People who are concerned about their 
privacy, analysts have concluded, should delete their 
Facebook accounts.

such as these in Chapter 8, and also throughout the text.

ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES CONCERNED WITH 
E-COMMERCE
The phenomenon of e-commerce is so broad that a multidisciplinary perspective is 
required. There are two primary approaches to e-commerce: technical and behavioral.
TECHNICAL APPROACHES
Computer scientists are interested in e-commerce as an exemplary application of 
Internet technology. They are concerned with the development of computer hard-
ware, software, and telecommunications systems, as well as standards, encryption, 
and database design and operation. Operations management scientists are primarily 
interested in building mathematical models of business processes and optimizing 
these processes. They are interested in e-commerce as an opportunity to study how 
business firms can exploit the Internet to achieve more efficient business operations. 
The information systems discipline spans the technical and behavioral approaches. 
Technical groups within the information systems specialty focus on data mining, 
search engine design, and artificial intelligence.
BEHAVIORAL APPROACHES
From a behavioral perspective, information systems researchers are primarily inter-
ested in e-commerce because of its implications for firm and industry value chains, 
industry structure, and corporate strategy. Economists have focused on online con-
sumer behavior, pricing of digital goods, and on the unique features of digital electronic 
markets. The marketing profession is interested in marketing, brand development and 
extension, online consumer behavior, and the ability of e-commerce technologies to 
segment and target consumer groups, and differentiate products. Economists share 
an interest with marketing scholars who have focused on e-commerce consumer 
response to marketing and advertising campaigns, and the ability of firms to brand, 
segment markets, target audiences, and position products to achieve above-normal 
returns on investment.
Management scholars have focused on entrepreneurial behavior and the chal-
lenges faced by young firms who are required to develop organizational structures in 
short time spans. Finance and accounting scholars have focused on e-commerce firm 
valuation and accounting practices. Sociologists—and to a lesser extent, psycholo-
gists—have focused on general population studies of Internet usage, the role of social 
inequality in skewing Internet benefits, and the use of the Web as a social network and 
group communications tool. Legal scholars are interested in issues such as preserving 
intellectual property, privacy, and content regulation.
No one perspective dominates research about e-commerce. The challenge is to 
learn enough about a variety of academic disciplines so that you can grasp the signifi-
cance of e-commerce in its entirety.

P i n t e r e s t :
A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words
L
ike all successful e-commerce companies, Pinterest taps into a simple truth. 
In Pinterest’s case, the simple truth is that people love to collect things, and 
show off their collections to others. Founded in 2009 by Ben Silbermann, 
Evan Sharp, and Paul Sciarra and launched in March 2010, Pinterest allows you to 
create virtual scrapbooks of images, video, and other content that you “pin” (save) to a 
virtual bulletin board or pin board. Categories range from Animals to Videos, with Food 
& Drink, DIY & Crafts, Home Décor, and Women’s Fashion among the most popular. Find 
something that you particularly like? In addition to “liking” and perhaps commenting on 
it, you can re-pin it to your own board or follow a link back to the original source. Find 
someone whose taste you admire or who shares your passions? You can follow one or 
more of that pinner’s boards to keep track of everything she or he pins. As of October 
2016, there were over 50 billion pins on Pinterest on more than 1 billion different boards. 
Pinterest originally positioned itself as a social network. However, it has changed its 
tune and now describes itself as a visual search tool for discovering and saving creative

ideas (and potential purchases), with less emphasis on sharing with friends. Search has 
become the core part of its mission. It views Google, rather than Facebook, Twitter, or 
Instagram, as its primary competition. 
In October 2016, Pinterest has over 150 million monthly active members worldwide. 
About 75% of those members are women, but men are its fastest growing demographic. 
Pinterest is one of the “stickiest” sites on the Web, with women spending over 1.5 hours 
(96 minutes) per session, and men about 1.25 hours (75 minutes). According to a survey 
by the Pew Research Center, the percentage of online adults in the United States who use 
Pinterest has more than doubled since 2012. 
Over the past five years, investors such as well-known Silicon Valley venture capital 
firms Andreessen Horowitz and Bessemer Venture Partners, hedge fund Valiant Capital 
Partners, and Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten have poured over $1.3 billion in 
venture capital into Pinterest, with its latest round of funding in May 2015 valuing the 
company at $11 billion, more than double its 2014 valuation. Like Facebook, Twitter, 
and many other startup companies, Pinterest focused initially on refining its product and 
building its user base, but not surprisingly, its investors began to push it to begin generat-
ing revenue. Pinterest’s first step was to offer business accounts that provided additional 
resources for brands. In 2013, it introduced Rich Pins, which allowed companies to embed 
information, such as current pricing and availability, as well as a direct link to a product 
page. In 2014, Pinterest took the official leap into the advertising arena, launching a 
beta version of ads it called Promoted Pins that appear in search results and category 
feeds. Around the same time, Pinterest also introduced a search engine, called Guided 
Search, which suggests related terms to refine a search. Guided Search is based on user 
metadata, such as board titles, captions, and comments related to pins, to create different 
categories and subcategories. In January 2015, Pinterest further enhanced Guided Search 
by allowing users to personalize search results based on gender. 
In the last two years, Pinterest has gotten serious about monetization. In January 
2015, it rolled out Promoted Pins to all its U.S.-based partners and in April 2016, began 
offering them to advertisers in the United Kingdom, with additional English-speaking 
countries expected to be added later in the year. In May 2015, it added Cinematic Pins, a 
made-for-mobile format. Cinematic Pins display a short animation when the user scrolls 
down through the ad, and only play a full-length version when the user clicks on the ad, 
providing more user control over the experience. Pinterest also introduced new ad-targeting 
and pricing options. Advertisers can target users by interests, life stage, or “persona” such 
as Millennial, prospective parent, or foodie. In June 2016, it added three additional ad-
targeting options: custom list targeting (similar to Facebook’s Custom Audiences); visitor 
targeting, which allows advertisers to retarget a customer who has visited the advertiser’s 
website; and lookalike targeting, which enables advertisers to target consumers who 
share traits or behaviors with the advertiser’s existing customers. Ads can be purchased 
on a pay-per-view, pay-per-click, cost-per-engagement (CPE), or cost-per-action (CPA) 
model. Using the CPE model, advertisers only pay when a user engages with a pin, such 
as through re-pinning, and with the CPA model, only when the user clicks through to a 
website and makes a purchase or downloads an app. As of 2016, there are more than 
1 million businesses on Pinterest, and over 10,000 different advertisers. During 2016,

Pinterest plans to broaden its focus from retail and packaged goods to financial services, 
travel, automotive, and fast food restaurants. 
Search advertising is the next frontier for Pinterest. Pinterest search differs from 
other types of search because it is visual and typically happens at the early stages of a 
person’s decision process. Users currently conduct over 2 billion keyword and 130 million 
visual searches per month on Pinterest. In July 2016, Pinterest began offering its search 
inventory to advertisers for the first time and is reportedly working on the infrastructure 
for keyword-based buying. Pinterest believes search advertising revenue can become a 
significant part of its business, and that it can challenge Google in the mobile search 
arena. It is making significant investments in search technology, such as deep-learning 
assisted visual search, which will build on its existing visual search tool that allows users 
to search within images on Pinterest. In August 2016, it began updating its visual search 
tools to work on videos and also began rolling out a fully integrated native video player 
similar to that offered by Facebook, along with video ads.
Many analysts also believe that Pinterest will become a significant factor in the social 
e-commerce arena. In June 2015, Pinterest launched Buyable Pins, which allow users to 
directly purchase products by clicking a blue Buy It button within the pin, for its iPhone 
and iPad apps. Buyable Pins for Android devices were rolled out in November 2015, and in 
June 2016 finally reached the desktop. According to Pinterest, 10 million unique items are 
available for sale, from merchants both large (such as Macy’s, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, 
Bloomingdale’s, and Wayfair) and small. Pinterest says its data shows that Buyable Pins 
are generating a significant percentage of brand-new customers for merchants. Pinterest 
is significantly ahead of other social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter in 
terms of the percentage of users who use it to find or shop for products: 55% for Pinterest 
versus just 12% for Facebook and Instagram and 9% for Twitter. To further enhance its 
lead, in 2016, it announced a number of other e-commerce-related initiatives, including 
Shopping with Pinterest, a shopping cart that links to a user’s account, is visible on all 
devices, can hold multiple items, and allows for checkout on any device. 
The fact that Pinterest launched Buyable Pins on its iOS mobile platform rather than 
the desktop is just one indication of how important the mobile platform is to Pinterest. 
Pinterest provides apps for iPhone, iPad, Android, and Windows Phone, as well as a 
mobile version of its website using HTML5. Pinterest Mobile runs inside the smartphone’s 
browser rather than as a stand-alone program. Mobile has been a huge success for 
Pinterest, with 80% of its traffic coming from mobile devices in 2016. Pinterest releases 
new versions of its mobile apps on a regular basis, and in April 2016 launched a nearly 
completely written iOS app that allows the home page to load much more quickly, scales 
to the different number of iOS screens more efficiently, and is readable in all 31 languages 
in which Pinterest is available. According to Pinterest co-founder Evan Sharp, the smart-
phone is the platform Pinterest focuses on when it develops new features and products. 
International expansion continues to be a major area of focus. Pinterest introduced 
its first localized site, for the United Kingdom in May 2013, and it is now available in 31 
different languages. Pinterest is aiming to make its platform feel more regional, focusing 
specifically on the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, and Brazil. In 2016, for the 
first time, more than 50% of its monthly active users are located outside of the United

States. Looking to the future, Pinterest believes that international expansion will provide 
it with the greatest growth opportunities. 
Despite all the good news for Pinterest, there are some issues lurking just behind the 
scenes that may cloud its future, such as the issue of copyright infringement. The basis of 
Pinterest’s business model involves users potentially violating others’ copyrights by posting 
images without permission and/or attribution. Although Pinterest’s Terms of Service puts the 
onus on its users to avoid doing so, the site knowingly facilitates such actions by, for example, 
providing a Pin It tool embedded in the user’s browser toolbar. Much content on the site 
reportedly violates its Terms of Service. Pinterest has provided an opt-out code to enable other 
sites to bar its content from being shared on Pinterest, but some question why they should 
have to take action when Pinterest is creating the problem. Another thing Pinterest has done 
to try to ameliorate the problem is to automatically add citations (attribution) to content 
coming from certain specified sources, such as Flickr, YouTube, Vimeo, Etsy, Kickstarter, 
and SlideShare, among others. In 2013, it entered into an agreement with Getty Images in 
which it agreed to provide attribution for Getty content and pay Getty a fee. Pinterest says it 
complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which requires sites to remove images 
that violate copyright, but this too requires the copyright holder to be proactive and take 
action to demand the images be removed. Christopher Boffoli, a well-known photographer, 
filed a federal lawsuit against Pinterest in late 2014 alleging that Pinterest users used his 
photographs without his permission and that Pinterest failed to take adequate measures to 
remove them. In September 2015, Boffoli agreed to dismiss the case, presumably as part of 
a confidential settlement with Pinterest, leaving the legal issues raised unresolved.
Pinterest is also not immune to the spam and scams that plague many e-commerce 
initiatives. Security analysts believe Pinterest will have to adapt its systems to deal with 
scammers and warn users to be wary of requests to pin content before viewing it and to 
be suspicious of “free” offers, surveys, and links with questionable titles. Pinterest has 
acknowledged the problem and has promised to improve its technology. In 2015, for in-
stance, Pinterest migrated its website to the HTTPS protocol, which provides more security 
than the more common HTTP protocol typically used to access web pages. Pinterest also 
employs a system known as Stingray that enables it to quickly react to spam and other 
types of malicious behavior, and has created a program that pays a bounty to white hat 
hackers who discover security issues. 
At the moment, however, the future looks very bright for Pinterest as it reportedly 
gears up for an initial public offering in the near future. Although it may encounter some 
growing pains in the process of implementing its new business model, it has the potential 
to generate significant revenue based on advertising and social e-commerce.

Understand why it is important to study e-commerce.
•	
The next five years hold out exciting opportunities—as well as risks—for new and traditional businesses 
to exploit digital technology for market advantage. It is important to study e-commerce in order to be able 
to perceive and understand these opportunities and risks that lie ahead.
Define e-commerce, understand how e-commerce differs from e-business, identify the primary technological building 
blocks underlying e-commerce, and recognize major current themes in e-commerce.
•	
E-commerce involves digitally enabled commercial transactions between and among organizations and 
individuals. 
•	
E-business refers primarily to the digital enabling of transactions and processes within a firm, involving 
information systems under the control of the firm. For the most part, unlike e-commerce, e-business does 
not involve commercial transactions across organizational boundaries where value is exchanged.
•	
The technology juggernauts behind e-commerce are the Internet, the Web, and increasingly, the mobile 
platform.
•	
From a business perspective, one of the most important trends to note is that all forms of e-commerce 
continue to show very strong growth. From a technology perspective, the mobile platform has finally 
arrived with a bang, driving astronomical growth in mobile advertising and making true mobile e-com-
merce a reality. At a societal level, major issues include privacy and government surveillance, protection 
of intellectual property, online security, and governance of the Internet.
Identify and describe the unique features of e-commerce technology and discuss their business significance.
There are eight features of e-commerce technology that are unique to this medium:
•	
Ubiquity—available just about everywhere, at all times, making it possible to shop from your desktop, at 
home, at work, or even from your car.
•	
Global reach—permits commercial transactions to cross cultural and national boundaries far more conve-
niently and cost-effectively than is true in traditional commerce.
•	
Universal standards—shared by all nations around the world, in contrast to most traditional commerce 
technologies, which differ from one nation to the next.
•	
Richness—enables an online merchant to deliver marketing messages in a way not possible with tradi-
tional commerce tech­nologies.
•	
Interactivity—allows for two-way communication between merchant and consumer and enables the mer-
chant to engage a consumer in ways similar to a face-to-face experience, but on a much more massive, 
global scale.
•	
Information density—is the total amount and quality of information available to all market participants. 
The Internet reduces information collection, storage, processing, and communication costs while increas-
ing the currency, accuracy, and timeliness of information.
•	
Personalization and customization—the increase in information density allows merchants to target their 
marketing messages to specific individuals and results in a level of personalization and customization 
unthinkable with previously existing commerce technologies.
•	
Social technology—provides a many-to-many model of mass communications. Millions of users are able to 
generate content consumed by millions of other users. The result is the formation of social networks on a 
wide scale and the aggregation of large audiences on social network platforms.

Describe the major types of e-commerce.
There are six major types of e-commerce:
•	
B2C e-commerce involves businesses selling to consumers and is the type of e-commerce that most con-
sumers are likely to encounter. 
•	
B2B e-commerce involves businesses selling to other businesses and is the largest form of e-commerce.
•	
C2C e-commerce is a means for consumers to sell to each other. In C2C e-commerce, the consumer pre-
pares the product for market, places the product for auction or sale, and relies on the market maker to 
provide catalog, search engine, and transaction clearing capabilities so that products can be easily dis-
played, discovered, and paid for.
•	
Social e-commerce is e-commerce that is enabled by social networks and online social relationships.
•	
M-commerce involves the use of wireless digital devices to enable online transactions.
•	
Local e-commerce is a form of e-commerce that is focused on engaging the consumer based on his or her 
current geographic location.
Understand the evolution of e-commerce from its early years to today.
E-commerce has gone through three stages: innovation, consolidation, and reinvention. 
•	
The early years of e-commerce were a technological success, with the digital infrastructure created dur-
ing the period solid enough to sustain significant growth in e-commerce during the next decade, and a 
mixed business success, with significant revenue growth and customer usage, but low profit margins.
•	
E-commerce entered a period of consolidation beginning in 2001 and extending into 2006.
•	
E-commerce entered a period of reinvention in 2007 with the emergence of the mobile digital platform, 
social networks, and Web 2.0 applications that attracted huge audiences in a very short time span.
Describe the major themes underlying the study of e-commerce.
E-commerce involves three broad interrelated themes:
•	
Technology—To understand e-commerce, you need a basic understanding of the information technologies 
upon which it is built, including the Internet, the Web, and mobile platform, and a host of complemen-
tary technologies—cloud computing, desktop computers, smartphones, tablet computers, local area net-
works, client/server computing, packet-switched communications, protocols such as TCP/IP, web servers, 
HTML, and relational and non-relational databases, among others.
•	
Business—While technology provides the infrastructure, it is the business applications—the potential for 
extraordinary returns on investment—that create the interest and excitement in e-commerce. Therefore, 
you also need to understand some key business concepts such as electronic markets, information goods, 
business models, firm and industry value chains, industry structure, and consumer behavior in digital 
markets.
•	
Society—Understanding the pressures that global e-commerce places on contemporary society is critical to 
being successful in the e-commerce marketplace. The primary societal issues are intellectual property, 
individual privacy, and public policy.
Identify the major academic disciplines contributing to e-commerce.
There are two primary approaches to e-commerce: technical and behavioral. Each of these approaches is 
represented by several academic disciplines. 
•	
On the technical side, this includes computer science, operations management, and information systems. 
•	
On the behavioral side, it includes information systems as well as sociology, economics, finance and 
accounting, management, and marketing.

witter, the social network 
based on 140-character text 
messages, continues in the 
long tradition of Internet developments 
that emerged seemingly out of nowhere 
to take the world by storm. Twitter’s basic 
idea was to marry short text messaging on 
cell phones with the Web and its ability to 
create social groups. 
Twitter has since expanded beyond 
simple text messages to article previews, 
photographs, videos, and even animated 
images, and today has over 310 million 
active users worldwide (as of June 2016). 
The 5,000 tweets a day that it began with 
in 2006 has turned into a deluge of around 
6,000 tweets per second and 500 million per day worldwide. Special events, such as the 
Super Bowl, tend to generate an explosion of tweets, with a total of 28.4 million tweets 
during the course of the game in 2015. Some celebrities, such as the pop star Katy Perry, 
have millions of followers (in Perry’s case, over 90 million as of 2016).
Like many social network firms, Twitter began operating without any revenue stream. 
However, it quickly developed some important assets, such as user attention and audience 
size (unique visitors). Another important asset is its database of tweets, which contain 
the real-time comments, observations, and opinions of its audience, and a search engine 
that can mine those tweets for patterns. In addition, Twitter has become a powerful 
alternative media platform for the distribution of news, videos, and pictures. Twitter has 
sought to monetize its platform via three primary advertising options, Promoted Tweets, 
Promoted Trends, and Promoted Accounts, although it continues to develop more and 
more variations on these products. 
Promoted Tweets are Twitter’s version of Google’s search ads. In response to a search 
on Twitter for tablet computers, for example, a Best Buy Promoted Tweet about tablets 
might be displayed. Promoted Tweets typically cost between 20 cents and $10. Twitter 
also offers geo-targeted and keyword targeting functionality, which enables advertisers 
to send Promoted Tweets to specific users in specific locations or based on their Twitter 
activity. Twitter’s research indicates that users are much more likely to engage with such 
Promoted Tweets than traditional online ads.

Promoted Trends is the second major Twitter advertising product. “Trends” is a section 
of the Twitter home page that identifies what people are talking about. A company can 
place a Promoted Trends banner at the top of the Trends section, and when users click on 
the banner, they are taken to the follower page for that company or product. A Promoted 
Trend must be purchased for an entire market for a day (for example, the United States) 
for a flat fee. In the United States, the fee is now $200,000, up from $80,000 when 
Promoted Trends were first introduced in 2010. 
Twitter’s third primary advertising product is Promoted Accounts, which are sug-
gestions to follow various advertiser accounts based on the list of accounts that the user 
already follows. Like Promoted Tweets, Promoted Accounts can be geo-targeted at both 
the country level and the local level. Promoted Accounts are priced on a cost-per-follower 
basis, with advertisers only paying for new followers gained. Prices range from $.50 to 
$2.50. Twitter also offers Enhanced Profile Pages for brands. For a reported $15,000 
to $25,000, companies get their own banner to display images, and the ability to pin a 
tweet to the top of the company’s Twitter stream. 
In 2013, Twitter began a natural progression into the video ad market. Video clips 
that include video ads can now be embedded within tweets. Known as the Twitter Amplify 
program, the program now includes media partners such as CBS, ESPN, Condé Nast, 
MLB.com, Warner Music, and others. Twitter also launched a television ad targeting 
product in 2013 that allows marketers to show Promoted Tweets to people who have 
been tweeting about a television show. In 2014, building on the Amplify program, Twitter 
announced a beta test of Promoted Video, which allows advertisers to distribute videos 
on the Twitter platform, and in 2015, it began allowing advertisers to use Promoted Video 
to link directly to app installations, as well as an ad purchasing feature for videos called 
“optimized action bidding.” This allows marketers to customize ad purchases to improve 
their return on investment. 
But it is mobile that has proven to be the primary driver of Twitter’s business and 
the source of most of its revenue. Twitter began testing Promoted Tweets and Promoted 
Accounts on mobile devices in March 2012, and by June 2012, reported that it was 
generating the majority of its revenues from ads on mobile devices rather than on its 
website. Twitter has acquired companies like MoPub and TapCommerce to bolster its 
mobile capabilities, and in 2015 made its largest acquisition yet, spending $533 million 
to acquire digital ad platform TellApart. Twitter hopes that TellApart’s technology will 
help improve its mobile ad targeting. Currently, Twitter derives over 80% of its advertising 
revenue from mobile. 
Twitter also continues to refine its data mining capability, recognizing that its stockpile 
of customer sentiment about products, services, and marketing efforts is among its most 
valuable assets. In 2013, Twitter purchased Big Data startup Lucky Sort and since then 
has acquired a number of companies such as Topsy Labs and Gnip that will help it improve 
its ability to provide information about its users’ behavior.
Twitter went public in November 2013 with a valuation of about $14 billion, raising 
$1.8 billion on top of the $1.2 billion it had previously raised from private investors and 
venture capital firms. The public offering was viewed as a rousing success, with the stock

price jumping almost 75% on its opening day, despite the fact that at the time, Twitter 
had not generated a profit. However, its share price has declined significantly from its 
high of over $74 in December 2013 down to around $18 per share as of October 2016, 
well below its IPO price. Analysts have reiterated serious concerns about Twitter’s lack of 
profitability and anemic growth rate.  Only about 20% of U.S. Internet users use Twitter, 
compared to the over 60% that use Facebook. The vast majority of its users (almost 
80%) are located outside the United States, although the United States is the source of 
over 50% of its ad revenues. 
Another issue is user engagement. Research indicates that the vast majority of tweets 
are generated by a small percentage of users: one study found that the top 15% of users 
account for 85% of all tweets. This is problematic because Twitter only makes money 
when a user engages with an ad. User retention is another problem. One study found 
that Twitter had only a 40% retention rate: 60% of users failed to return the following 
month. Only about 11% of the accounts created in 2012 are still tweeting. Acknowledging 
a need for a change in direction, CEO Dick Costolo stepped down in 2015, replaced by 
co-founder Jack Dorsey.
Twitter recognizes that one of its problems is that it is perceived to be more confusing 
to use than Facebook. Twitter’s first move with Dorsey at the helm was to launch Moments, 
a feature that packages tweets into thematic groups that are easier to follow. The company 
also announced upcoming changes to relax the 140-character limit for certain types of 
content and to provide a curated selection of tweets for users who have been away that 
might be especially interesting based on their previous activity. Analysts argue that these 
moves are merely cosmetic.
Dorsey has also vowed to narrow the company’s focus on their core service. Twitter 
is moving away from products and features that don’t do enough to enhance the basic 
user experience. For example, Twitter had hoped that it would become a hub of social 
e-commerce, and rolled out a Buy Now button in 2014 that allowed users to add products 
to their Amazon shopping cart. However, in 2016, development on the service has halted 
due to the users’ lukewarm response to the feature. Other services that have failed to take 
off, such as Twitter’s #Music app, have been shelved until further notice. For the time 
being, Twitter is focusing on improving its video capability, including improving support 
for its popular Periscope video service. In 2016, Twitter purchased the rights to stream 
Thursday night NFL games. The ability to stream live events on Twitter is a substantive 
change in strategy that could help keep users on the site longer. 
Despite Dorsey’s reshuffling, including restructuring Twitter’s board and firing 8% 
of the workforce, Twitter has yet to reverse its flagging earnings and stagnant growth. In 
October 2016, Salesforce was rumored to interested in acquiring Twitter, but decided not 
to pursue a takeover. Shortly thereafter, Twitter reported yet another loss for the third 
quarter of the year, and  announced that it was cutting an additional 9% of its workforce 
and shutting down its Vine video app. It is clear Twitter has not yet found a business 
model that works.

he story of Twitter illustrates the difficulties of turning a good business 
idea with a huge audience into a successful business model that pro-
duces revenues and even profits. 
Thousands of firms have discovered that they can spend other people’s invested 
capital much faster than they can get customers to pay for their products or services. 
In most instances of failure, the business model of the firm is faulty from the begin-
ning. In contrast, successful e-commerce firms have business models that are able 
to leverage the unique qualities of the Internet, the Web, and the mobile platform, 
provide customers real value, develop highly effective and efficient operations, avoid 
legal and social entanglements that can harm the firm, and produce profitable business 
results. In addition, successful business models must scale. The business must be able 
to achieve efficiencies as it grows in volume. But what is a business model, and how 
can you tell if a firm’s business model is going to produce a profit?
In this chapter, we focus on business models and basic business concepts that you 
must be familiar with in order to understand e-commerce.
	 2.1	
E-COMMERCE BUSINESS MODELS 
INTRODUCTION
A business model is a set of planned activities (sometimes referred to as business 
processes) designed to result in a profit in a marketplace. A business model is not 
always the same as a business strategy, although in some cases they are very close 
insofar as the business model explicitly takes into account the competitive environ-
ment (Magretta, 2002). The business model is at the center of the business plan. A 
business plan is a document that describes a firm’s business model. A business plan 
always takes into account the competitive environment. An e-commerce business 
model aims to use and leverage the unique qualities of the Internet, the Web, and the 
mobile platform.
EIGHT KEY ELEMENTS OF A BUSINESS MODEL
If you hope to develop a successful business model in any arena, not just e-com-
merce, you must make sure that the model effectively addresses the eight elements 
listed in Figure 2.1. These elements are value proposition, revenue model, market 
opportunity, competitive environment, competitive advantage, market strategy, 
organizational development, and management team. Many writers focus on a firm’s 
value proposition and revenue model. While these may be the most important and 
most easily identifiable aspects of a company’s business model, the other elements 
are equally important when evaluating business models and plans, or when attempt-
ing to understand why a particular company has succeeded or failed (Kim and 
Mauborgne, 2000). In the following sections, we describe each of the key business 
model elements more fully.

Value Proposition
A company’s value proposition is at the very heart of its business model. A value 
proposition defines how a company’s product or service fulfills the needs of custom-
ers (Kambil, Ginsberg, and Bloch, 1998). To develop and/or analyze a firm’s value 
proposition, you need to understand why customers will choose to do business with 
the firm instead of another company and what the firm provides that other firms do 
not and cannot. From the consumer point of view, successful e-commerce value propo-
sitions include personalization and customization of product offerings, reduction of 
product search costs, reduction of price discovery costs, and facilitation of transactions 
by managing product delivery.

A business model has eight key elements. Each element must be addressed if you hope to be successful.

For instance, before Amazon existed, most customers personally traveled to book 
retailers to place an order. In some cases, the desired book might not be available, 
and the customer would have to wait several days or weeks, and then return to the 
bookstore to pick it up. Amazon makes it possible for book lovers to shop for virtually 
any book in print from the comfort of their home or office, 24 hours a day, and to know 
immediately whether a book is in stock. Amazon’s Kindle takes this one step further 
by making e-books instantly available with no shipping wait. Amazon’s primary value 
propositions are unparalleled selection and convenience.
Revenue Model
A firm’s revenue model describes how the firm will earn revenue, generate profits, 
and produce a superior return on invested capital. We use the terms revenue model and 
financial model interchangeably. The function of business organizations is both to 
generate profits and to produce returns on invested capital that exceed alternative 
investments. Profits alone are not sufficient to make a company “successful” (Porter, 
1985). In order to be considered successful, a firm must produce returns greater than 
alternative investments. Firms that fail this test go out of existence.
Although there are many different e-commerce revenue models that have been 
developed, most companies rely on one, or some combination, of the following major 
revenue models: advertising, subscription, transaction fee, sales, and affiliate.
In the advertising revenue model, a company that offers content, services, 
and/or products also provides a forum for advertisements and receives fees from 
advertisers. Companies that are able to attract the greatest viewership or that have a 
highly specialized, differentiated viewership and are able to retain user attention 
(“stickiness”) are able to charge higher advertising rates. Yahoo, for instance, derives 
a significant amount of revenue from display and video advertising.
In the subscription revenue model, a company that offers content or services 
charges a subscription fee for access to some or all of its offerings. For instance, the 
digital version of Consumer Reports provides online and mobile access to premium 
content, such as detailed ratings, reviews, and recommendations, only to subscribers, 
who have a choice of paying a $6.95 monthly subscription fee or a $30.00 annual fee. 
Experience with the subscription revenue model indicates that to successfully overcome 
the disinclination of users to pay for content, the content offered must be perceived as 
a high-value-added, premium offering that is not readily available elsewhere nor easily 
replicated. Companies successfully offering content or services online on a subscription 
basis include eHarmony (dating services), Ancestry (genealogy research), Microsoft’s 
Xbox Live (video games), Pandora, Spotify, and Apple Music (music), Scribd and Ama-
zon’s Kindle Unlimited program (e-books), and Netflix and Hulu (television and movies). 
See Table 2.1 for examples of various subscription services.
Recently, a number of companies have been combining a subscription revenue 
model with a freemium strategy. In a freemium strategy, the companies give away 
a certain level of product or services for free, but then charge a subscription fee for 
premium levels of the product or service. See the case study, Freemium Takes Pandora 
Public, at the end of the chapter, for a further look at the freemium strategy.

In the transaction fee revenue model, a company receives a fee for enabling 
or executing a transaction. For example, eBay provides an auction marketplace and 
receives a small transaction fee from a seller if the seller is successful in selling the 
item. E*Trade, a financial services provider, receives transaction fees each time it 
executes a stock transaction on behalf of a customer.
In the sales revenue model, companies derive revenue by selling goods, content, 
or services to customers. Companies such as Amazon, L.L.Bean, and Gap all have sales 
revenue models. A number of companies are also using a subscription-based sales 
revenue model. Birchbox, which offers home delivery of beauty products for a $10 
monthly or $100 annual subscription price, is one example. Dollar Shave Club, which 
sells razor blades by subscription and was recently acquired by Unilever for $1 billion, 
is another. 
In the affiliate revenue model, companies that steer business to an “affiliate” 
receive a referral fee or percentage of the revenue from any resulting sales. For 
example, MyPoints makes money by connecting companies with potential customers 
by offering special deals to its members. When they take advantage of an offer and 
make a purchase, members earn “points” they can redeem for freebies, and MyPoints 
receives a fee. Community feedback companies typically receive some of their revenue 
from steering potential customers to websites where they make a purchase.
Table 2.2 summarizes these major revenue models. The Insight on Society case, 
Foursquare: Check Your Privacy at the Door, examines some of the issues associated with 
Foursquare's business and revenue model.

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY 
FOURSQUARE: CHECK YOUR PRIVACY AT THE DOOR
Foursquare is one of a host of com-
panies that combine a social network 
business model with location-based 
technology. Foursquare offers mobile 
social applications that know where you 
are located and can provide you with informa-
tion about popular spots nearby, as well as reviews 
from other Foursquare users. Its apps also allow 
you to check in to a restaurant or other location, 
and automatically let friends on Facebook and 
other social networks learn where you are. Founded 
in 2008 by Dennis Crowley and Naveen Selvadu-
rai, Foursquare has more than 55 million monthly 
active users worldwide, split fairly evenly between 
the United States and the rest of the world, who 
have checked in over 8 billion times. There’s poten-
tially a great deal of money to be made by com-
bining a social network with smartphone-based 
technology that can identify your location precisely. 
Location-based data has extraordinary commercial 
value because advertisers can then send you adver-
tisements, coupons, and flash bargains, based on 
where you are located.
In 2014, Foursquare shook up its business 
model when it split its app into two separate 
apps with different focuses. Its redesigned Four-
square app became a recommender system akin 
to a travel guide, using passive location track-
ing to offer suggestions to users for where to eat 
or visit. A separate app, Swarm, absorbed Four-
square’s check-in feature. The redesigned app asks 
the user to identify things he or she likes, known as 
“tastes,” from over 10,000 possibilities (ranging 
from barbecue to museums to board games), and 
then provides recommendations. Rather than earn 
badges, users are encouraged to add tips to work 
toward becoming an expert. Many loyal Four-
square users were driven away by the change. In 
2015, the company added many of the old fea-
tures, such as status levels, mayorships (awards 
offered to users with the most check-ins at a 
particular location), and leaderboards, back to 
Swarm. Foursquare’s decision was influenced pri-
marily by its continued struggles to find profitabil-
ity, though it’s not for lack of trying. Foursquare 
has continued to develop in-app advertising prod-
ucts that serve advertising based on users’ loca-
tions and has formed partnerships with companies 
like American Express to offer discounts to card-
holders after using Foursquare to check-in. Unfor-
tunately for Foursquare, Facebook and seemingly 
every other social network now offer the ability to 
check-in and share that information with friends. 
However, in 2015, Foursquare shifted in a different 
direction with the launch of its Pinpoint product, 
an advertising tool that allows marketers unprec-
edented ability to target users based on its accu-
mulated historical location data and to filter out 
inaccurate data. Most importantly, Pinpoint can 
even reach mobile users without the Foursquare 
app, a major advantage considering the company’s 
relatively low number of in-network users com-
pared to other top social networks. 
In 2016, Foursquare is likely to focus more on 
Pinpoint and other technologies that it can offer 
other companies than on its flagship check-in app. 
From 2014 to 2016, Foursquare’s revenue doubled 
on a year-to-year basis, including a 170% increase 
in its advertising solutions business in 2015. This 
growth has been driven primarily by data licensing 
agreements with other tech and social networking 
giants. For example, in 2014, Foursquare struck 
just such an agreement with Microsoft, which may 
use the data to customize Bing on a user-by-user 
basis with specific search results and advertise-
ments based on their location data. Foursquare has 
also struck similar deals with Twitter, Google, Yahoo, 
and Pinterest to provide location-based functions 
and to share location data, increasing the richness 
and accuracy of its own data in the process. All of 

	
E - c o m m e r c e  B u s i n e s s  M o d e l s  	 
61
these partnerships greatly enrich the value of Pin-
point and allow Foursquare to track users that are 
not even a part of its platform. All of a sudden, 
Foursquare’s “lowly” 55 million users and unim-
pressive user growth don’t matter quite as much. 
In 2016, Foursquare received $45 million in new 
financing, albeit at a much lower valuation than 
its last round of financing in 2013. Crowley also 
stepped down as CEO as the company restructured 
its executive team to focus on continued develop-
ment of both advertising products as well as tech-
niques to monetize its location data. The company 
believes that its renewed focus on its advertising 
products will help it overcome the stigma of its 
stalled user growth.
As the popularity of location-based services 
like Foursquare has grown, so too have concerns 
about privacy. Privacy advocates point out that 
many apps have no privacy policy, that most of 
the popular apps transmit location data to their 
developers, after which the information is not well 
controlled, and that these services are creating a 
situation where government, marketers, creditors, 
and telecommunications firms will end up knowing 
nearly everything about citizens, including their 
whereabouts. Many users may not truly understand 
how much of their location history is available to 
their friends. A 2016 study indicated that algo-
rithms that analyze Twitter posts in tandem with 
Foursquare or Instagram posts can identify users’ 
identities with relative ease. One advantage Four-
square does have, though, is that many of its users 
are actually interested in having their loca-
tion tracked and their data collected—users 
are less likely to revolt when they find that Four-
square is collecting and sharing their data.
The Foursquare app automatically provides 
Foursquare with the phone’s GPS coordinates 
any time the phone is turned on, even when the 
app is closed, unless the user specifically opts out 
of such tracking. In contrast, Facebook’s Nearby 
Friends feature requires users to opt in. Persistent 
location tracking of this sort further enhances the 
value of Foursquare’s location data. Foursquare 
claims that the services it provides are a fair trade 
for the data it collects; privacy experts are con-
cerned that users cannot delete archived loca-
tion data from Foursquare’s servers. Striking a 
balance between respecting user privacy and con-
tinuing to drive profitability will continue to be a 
challenge for Foursquare moving forward. Signal-
ing a desire to meet its users’ demands for privacy, 
in 2016, Swarm began allowing users to check 
in without sharing their locations publicly; but at 
approximately the same time, Foursquare released 
its Attribution product, which mines daily loca-
tion information of over 1.3 million Foursquare 
users who have consented to location tracking in 
order to determine whether or not the advertising 
they’ve seen has actually influenced their purchas-
ing decisions. In July 2016, Foursquare released a 
digital dashboard for advertising using Attribution 
that lets marketers drill down into the data even 
further, with even more detailed audience metrics.

Market Opportunity
The term market opportunity refers to the company’s intended marketspace (i.e., 
an area of actual or potential commercial value) and the overall potential financial 
opportunities available to the firm in that marketspace. The market opportunity is 
usually divided into smaller market niches. The realistic market opportunity is defined 
by the revenue potential in each of the market niches where you hope to compete.
For instance, let’s assume you are analyzing a software training company that 
creates online software-learning systems for sale to businesses. The overall size of 
the software training market for all market segments is approximately $70 billion. 
The overall market can be broken down, however, into two major market segments: 
instructor-led training products, which comprise about 70% of the market ($49 billion 
in revenue), and computer-based training, which accounts for 30% ($21 billion). There 
are further market niches within each of those major market segments, such as the 
Fortune 500 computer-based training market and the small business computer-based 
training market. Because the firm is a start-up firm, it cannot compete effectively in 
the large business, computer-based training market (about $15 billion). Large brand-
name training firms dominate this niche. The start-up firm’s real market opportunity 
is to sell to the thousands of small business firms that spend about $6 billion on 
computer-based software training. This is the size of the firm’s realistic market oppor-
tunity (see Figure 2.2).
Competitive Environment
A firm’s competitive environment refers to the other companies selling similar 
products and operating in the same marketspace. It also refers to the presence of 
substitute products and potential new entrants to the market, as well as the power 
of customers and suppliers over your business. We discuss the firm’s environment

later in the chapter. The competitive environment for a company is influenced by 
several factors: how many competitors are active, how large their operations are, 
what the market share of each competitor is, how profitable these firms are, and 
how they price their products.
Firms typically have both direct and indirect competitors. Direct competitors 
are companies that sell very similar products and services into the same market 
segment. For example, Priceline and Travelocity, both of whom sell discount airline 
tickets online, are direct competitors because both companies sell identical prod-
ucts—cheap tickets. Indirect competitors are companies that may be in different 
industries but still compete indirectly because their products can substitute for one 
another. For instance, automobile manufacturers and airline companies operate in 
different industries, but they still compete indirectly because they offer consumers 
alternative means of transportation. CNN, a news outlet, is an indirect competitor of 
ESPN, not because they sell identical products, but because they both compete for 
consumers’ time online.
The existence of a large number of competitors in any one segment may be a 
sign that the market is saturated and that it may be difficult to become profitable. On 
the other hand, a lack of competitors could signal either an untapped market niche 
ripe for the picking, or a market that has already been tried without success because 
there is no money to be made. Analysis of the competitive environment can help you 
decide which it is.
Competitive Advantage
Firms achieve a competitive advantage when they can produce a superior product 
and/or bring the product to market at a lower price than most, or all, of their 
competitive advantage

competitors (Porter, 1985). Firms also compete on scope. Some firms can develop 
global markets, while other firms can develop only a national or regional market. 
Firms that can provide superior products at the lowest cost on a global basis are truly 
advantaged.
Firms achieve competitive advantages because they have somehow been able to 
obtain differential access to the factors of production that are denied to their competi-
tors—at least in the short term (Barney, 1991). Perhaps the firm has been able to obtain 
very favorable terms from suppliers, shippers, or sources of labor. Or perhaps the firm 
has more experienced, knowledgeable, and loyal employees than any competitors. 
Maybe the firm has a patent on a product that others cannot imitate, or access to 
investment capital through a network of former business colleagues or a brand name 
and popular image that other firms cannot duplicate. An asymmetry exists whenever 
one participant in a market has more resources—financial backing, knowledge, infor-
mation, and/or power—than other participants. Asymmetries lead to some firms 
having an edge over others, permitting them to come to market with better products, 
faster than competitors, and sometimes at lower cost.
For instance, when Apple announced iTunes, a service offering legal, download-
able individual song tracks for 99 cents a track that would be playable on any digital 
device with iTunes software, the company had better-than-average odds of success 
simply because of Apple’s prior success with innovative hardware designs, and the 
large stable of music firms that Apple had meticulously lined up to support its online 
music catalog. Few competitors could match the combination of cheap, legal songs 
and powerful hardware to play them on.
One rather unique competitive advantage derives from being a first mover. A 
first-mover advantage is a competitive market advantage for a firm that results from 
being the first into a marketplace with a serviceable product or service. If first movers 
develop a loyal following or a unique interface that is difficult to imitate, they can 
sustain their first-mover advantage for long periods (Arthur, 1996). Amazon provides 
a good example. However, in the history of technology-driven business innovation, 
most first movers often lack the complementary resources needed to sustain their 
advantages, and often follower firms reap the largest rewards (Rigdon, 2000; Teece, 
1986). Indeed, many of the success stories we discuss in this book are those of com-
panies that were slow followers—businesses that gained knowledge from the failure 
of pioneering firms and entered into the market late.
Some competitive advantages are called “unfair.” An unfair competitive advan-
tage occurs when one firm develops an advantage based on a factor that other firms 
cannot purchase (Barney, 1991). For instance, a brand name cannot be purchased and 
is in that sense an “unfair” advantage. Brands are built upon loyalty, trust, reliability, 
and quality. Once obtained, they are difficult to copy or imitate, and they permit firms 
to charge premium prices for their products.
In perfect markets, there are no competitive advantages or asymmetries because 
all firms have access to all the factors of production (including information and knowl-
edge) equally. However, real markets are imperfect, and asymmetries leading to 
competitive advantages do exist, at least in the short term. Most competitive 
asymmetry 
exists whenever one 
participant in a market has 
more resources than other 
participants

advantages are short term, although some can be sustained for very long periods. But 
not forever. In fact, many respected brands fail every year. 
Companies are said to leverage their competitive assets when they use their 
competitive advantages to achieve more advantage in surrounding markets. For 
instance, Amazon’s move into the online grocery business leverages the company’s 
huge customer database and years of e-commerce experience. 
Market Strategy
No matter how tremendous a firm’s qualities, its marketing strategy and execution are 
often just as important. The best business concept, or idea, will fail if it is not properly 
marketed to potential customers.
Everything you do to promote your company’s products and services to potential 
customers is known as marketing. Market strategy is the plan you put together that 
details exactly how you intend to enter a new market and attract new customers.
For instance, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest have a social network marketing 
strategy that encourages users to post their content for free, build personal profile 
pages, contact their friends, and build a community. In these cases, the customer 
becomes part of the marketing staff!
Organizational Development
Although many entrepreneurial ventures are started by one visionary individual, it 
is rare that one person alone can grow an idea into a multi-million dollar company. 
In most cases, fast-growth companies—especially e-commerce businesses—need 
employees and a set of business procedures. In short, all firms—new ones in particu-
lar—need an organization to efficiently implement their business plans and strategies. 
Many e-commerce firms and many traditional firms that attempt an e-commerce 
strategy have failed because they lacked the organizational structures and supportive 
cultural values required to support new forms of commerce (Kanter, 2001).
Companies that hope to grow and thrive need to have a plan for organizational 
development that describes how the company will organize the work that needs to 
be accomplished. Typically, work is divided into functional departments, such as 
production, shipping, marketing, customer support, and finance. Jobs within these 
functional areas are defined, and then recruitment begins for specific job titles and 
responsibilities. Typically, in the beginning, generalists who can perform multiple 
tasks are hired. As the company grows, recruiting becomes more specialized. For 
instance, at the outset, a business may have one marketing manager. But after two or 
three years of steady growth, that one marketing position may be broken down into 
seven separate jobs done by seven individuals.
For instance, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar started an online auction site, accord-
ing to some sources, to help his girlfriend trade Pez dispensers with other collectors, 
but within a few months the volume of business had far exceeded what he alone could 
handle. So he began hiring people with more business experience to help out. Soon 
the company had many employees, departments, and managers who were responsible 
for overseeing the various aspects of the organization.

Management Team
Arguably, the single most important element of a business model is the management 
team responsible for making the model work. A strong management team gives a 
model instant credibility to outside investors, immediate market-specific knowledge, 
and experience in implementing business plans. A strong management team may not 
be able to salvage a weak business model, but the team should be able to change the 
model and redefine the business as it becomes necessary.
Eventually, most companies get to the point of having several senior executives 
or managers. How skilled managers are, however, can be a source of competitive 
advantage or disadvantage. The challenge is to find people who have both the experi-
ence and the ability to apply that experience to new situations.
To be able to identify good managers for a business start-up, first consider the 
kinds of experiences that would be helpful to a manager joining your company. What 
kind of technical background is desirable? What kind of supervisory experience is 
necessary? How many years in a particular function should be required? What job 
functions should be fulfilled first: marketing, production, finance, or operations? Espe-
cially in situations where financing will be needed to get a company off the ground, 
do prospective senior managers have experience and contacts for raising financing 
from outside investors? 
Table 2.3 summarizes the eight key elements of a business model and the key 
questions that must be answered in order to successfully develop each element.
RAISING CAPITAL
Raising capital is one of the most important functions for a founder of a start-up busi-
ness and its management team. Not having enough capital to operate effectively is a 
primary reason why so many start-up businesses fail. Many entrepreneurs initially 
“bootstrap” to get a business off the ground, using personal funds derived from savings,

credit card advances, home equity loans, or from family and friends. Funds of this 
type are often referred to as seed capital. Once such funds are exhausted, if the 
company is not generating enough revenue to cover operating costs, additional capital 
will be needed. Traditional sources of capital include incubators, commercial banks, 
angel investors, venture capital firms, and strategic partners. One of the most impor-
tant aspects of raising capital is the ability to boil down the elements of the company’s 
business plan into an elevator pitch, a short two-to-three minute (about the length 
of an elevator ride, giving rise to its name) presentation aimed at convincing investors 
to invest. Table 2.4 lists the key elements of an elevator pitch.
Incubators (sometimes also referred to as accelerators) such as Y Combinator 
(profiled in Chapter 1’s Insight on Business case) typically provide a small amount of 
funding, but more importantly, also provide an array of services to start-up companies 
that they select to participate in their programs, such as business, technical, and 
marketing assistance, as well as introductions to other sources of capital. Well-known 
incubator programs include TechStars, DreamIt, and Capital Factory.
Obtaining a loan from a commercial bank is often difficult for a start-up company 
without much revenue, but it may be worthwhile to investigate programs offered 
by the U.S. Small Business Administration, and its state or local equivalents. The 
advantage of obtaining capital in the form of a loan (debt) is that, although it must be 
repaid, it does not require an entrepreneur to give up any ownership of the company. 
Angel investors are typically wealthy individuals (or a group of individuals) who 
invest their own money in an exchange for an equity share in the stock in the business. 
In general, angel investors make smaller investments (typically $1 million or less) than 
venture capital firms, are interested in helping a company grow and succeed, and invest 
on relatively favorable terms compared to later stage investors. The first round of exter-
nal investment in a company is sometimes referred to as Series A financing.

Venture capital investors typically become more interested in a start-up company 
once it has begun attracting a large audience and generating some revenue, even if it 
is not profitable. Venture capital investors invest funds they manage for other 
investors such as investment banks, pension funds, insurance companies, or other 
businesses, and usually want to obtain a larger stake in the business and exercise more 
control over the operation of the business. Venture capital investors also typically want 
a well-defined “exit strategy,” such as a plan for an initial public offering or acquisition 
of the company by a more established business within a relatively short period of time 
(typically 3 to 7 years), that will enable them to obtain an adequate return on their 
investment. Venture capital investment often ultimately means that the founder(s) 
and initial investors will no longer control the company at some point in the future. 
Crowdfunding involves using the Internet to enable individuals to collectively 
contribute money to support a project. The concepts behind crowdfunding have 
been popularized by Kickstarter and Indiegogo, but they were not able to be used 
for equity investments in for-profit companies in the United States due to securities 
regulations. However, the passage of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) 
Act in 2012 and issuance of regulations by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
in July 2013 has enabled companies to use the Internet to solicit wealthy (“accred-
ited”) investors to invest in small and early-stage start-ups in exchange for stock. 
Regulation A+, which enables equity crowdfunding investments by non-accredited 
investors (people with a net worth of less than $1 million and who earned less than 
$200,000 a year in the previous two years), took effect in June 2015. Regulations 
implementing even broader-based equity crowdfunding authorized by the JOBS Act, 
which allow investments by people with annual income or net worth of less than 
$100,000, also recently took effect, in May 2016. See the Insight on Business case, 
Crowdfunding Takes Off, for a further look at the issues surrounding crowdfunding. 
CATEGORIZING E-COMMERCE BUSINESS MODELS: SOME DIFFICULTIES
There are many e-commerce business models, and more are being invented every 
day. The number of such models is limited only by the human imagination, and our 
list of different business models is certainly not exhaustive. However, despite the 
abundance of potential models, it is possible to identify the major generic types (and 
subtle variations) of business models that have been developed for the e-commerce 
arena and describe their key features. It is important to realize, however, that there is 
no one correct way to categorize these business models.
Our approach is to categorize business models according to the different major 
e-commerce sectors—B2C and B2B—in which they are utilized. You will note, however, 
that fundamentally similar business models may appear in more than one sector. For 
example, the business models of online retailers (often called e-tailers) and e-distribu-
tors are quite similar. However, they are distinguished by the market focus of the sector 
in which they are used. In the case of e-tailers in the B2C sector, the business model 
focuses on sales to the individual consumer, while in the case of the e-distributor, the 
business model focuses on sales to another business. Many companies use a variety of

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
CROWDFUNDING TAKES OFF
Think you have the next big idea 
but lack the resources to make it 
happen? Crowdfunding sites might 
be your best shot. Sites such as Kick-
starter, Indiegogo, RocketHub, and Tilt 
have led the growth of crowdfunding from 
$530 million in 2009 to over $34 billion in 2015. 
A World Bank study predicts that capital raised 
via crowdfunding will exceed $93 billion by 2025. 
The Internet is the ideal medium for crowdfunding 
because it allows individuals and organizations in 
need of funds and potential backers to find one 
another around the globe.
How do sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo 
work? The idea is simple—an inventor, artist, or 
activist looking to raise money for a project uses 
the site to create a page for that project. People 
can pledge to support the project, but at Kick-
starter, money actually only changes hands once 
the project fully reaches its funding goal (other 
sites, such as Indiegogo and RocketHub, allow 
project creators to keep the money they raise even 
if they do not achieve their goal). The sites take 
a small commission, usually about 5%, on com-
pleted projects. Backers often receive some type 
of reward, often corresponding to the size of their 
contribution to the project.
Crowdfunding is quickly becoming a main-
stay in the development of movies, video games, 
art installations, and other types of projects. For 
instance, among the most funded Kickstarter proj-
ects to date are Pebble, a customizable e-paper 
watch that connects to a smartphone (over $33 
million raised across several campaigns) and 
Coolest Cooler, a cooler with a waterproof Blue-
tooth speaker, USB charger and other high tech 
features ($13.3 million). Several of the biggest 
Kickstarter projects have been movie projects that 
struggled to gain traction at Hollywood studios, 
like the Veronica Mars movie project ($5.7 
million) and a project to reboot the popular educa-
tional TV show Reading Rainbow, which garnered 
over $5 million in financing in 2015. In 2014, a 
man from Ohio solicited $10 in donations to make 
a batch of potato salad as a joke, but after his 
campaign went viral, he raised over $55,000, 
much of which he used to support local charities. 
The applications for crowdfunding are limited only 
by the imagination.
Successful crowdfunding projects typically 
share some common elements. One of the most 
important is a clear and concise presentation of 
the idea, especially through the use of video. The 
crowdfunding campaign is in many ways similar 
to presenting a business plan, and should touch 
on the same eight elements of a business model, 
such as the project’s value proposition, its target 
market, and so on. A whole ecosystem of video 
producers, editors, and other services has sprung 
up to support crowdfunding projects. 
Not every crowdfunding project gets off the 
ground—Kickstarter reports that only about 
35% of its approximately 308,000 projects thus 
far have reached their funding goals. Sometimes 
projects that do get off the ground simply flame 
out, disappointing their backers. For instance, 
the Coolest Cooler has been marred by price 
increases, delays in production, and failure to 
deliver the product to its original backers, despite 
shipping it to those who pay full retail price on 
Amazon. Another high profile Kickstarter, fledgling 
drone manufacturer Zano, went bankrupt before 
ever completing its product, despite raising $3.4 
million. Kickstarter now requires fundraisers to

disclose the risks associated with their 
project, and for inventions, now requires 
photos of prototype products instead of simply 
drawings, simulations, or renderings. But backers 
still have no real recourse with respect to proj-
ects that never get off the ground or unresponsive 
founders.
A new use of crowdfunding is to provide seed 
capital for startup companies in return for equity 
(shares) in the company, known as equity crowd-
funding. Under the JOBS Act passed by Congress 
in 2012, a company will be able to crowdfund 
up to $1 million over a 12-month period, and in 
2016, the rules requiring potential investors to 
be accredited (having a net worth of at least $1 
million dollars) were relaxed to allow smaller 
investors to purchase equity stakes of $2,000 or 
more. Twenty-five states have their own crowd-
funding rules that allow local businesses to raise 
money in this way, and the 2016 regulations will 
also fix a loophole preventing these businesses 
from advertising to investors from outside their 
respective states. However, equity crowdfunding 
will require extensive compliance from businesses, 
with steep penalties for any irregularities, and 
potential investors will be subject to all the same 
risks that professional investors experience, but 
may put themselves in more precarious financial 
positions as a result. They’ll also be forced to hold 
their investments for at least one year. 
Kickstarter currently has no plans to allow 
creators to offer equity in Kickstarter projects, 
believing that equity crowdfunding is funda-
mentally different from the projects on its site, 
which focus less on profits and more on ideas and 
social issues. In the meantime, many companies, 
such as Indiegogo, Crowdfunder, AngelList, and 
StartEngine are laying the groundwork for an 
expected explosion of activity. Indiegogo in par-
ticular has been open about its support for the 
JOBS act and is currently working on implement-
ing it as an option on its site in the near future. 
When it does, it’s likely to immediately become 
the dominant player in the industry thanks to its 
15 million monthly visitors. Niche companies are 
also springing up, with varying degrees of success. 
For instance, SeedInvest is a company that caters 
to investors who may have concerns about crowd-
funding privacy by offering better privacy con-
trols. CircleUp is focused on consumer products. 
As crowdfunding becomes more widely recognized 
by the general public, more specialty sites such as 
these are likely to spring up. However, studies from 
MIT and the College of William and Mary suggest 
that equity crowdfunding isn’t as likely to lead 
to positive outcomes for smaller investors. Many 
of the highest quality startups won’t need to use 
equity crowdfunding and will instead pursue more 
traditional venture capitalists, and smaller inves-
tors may be more likely to fall prey to misleading 
claims from businesses seeking funding. It’s likely 
that more regulations will need to be developed to 
protect smaller equity crowdfunding investors in 
coming months and years.

different business models as they attempt to extend into as many areas of e-commerce 
as possible. We look at B2C business models in Section 2.2 and B2B business models 
in Section 2.3.
A business’s technology platform is sometimes confused with its business model. 
For instance, “mobile e-commerce” refers to the use of mobile devices and cellular and 
wide area networks to support a variety of business models. Commentators sometimes 
confuse matters by referring to mobile e-commerce as a distinct business model, which 
it is not. All of the basic business models we discuss below can be implemented on 
both the traditional Internet/Web and mobile platforms. Likewise, although they are 
sometimes referred to as such, social e-commerce and local e-commerce are not busi-
ness models in and of themselves, but rather subsectors of B2C and B2B e-commerce 
in which different business models can operate. 
You will also note that some companies use multiple business models. For 
instance, Amazon has multiple business models: it is an e-retailer, content provider, 
market creator, e-commerce infrastructure provider, and more. eBay is a market 
creator in the B2C and C2C e-commerce sectors, using both the traditional Inter-
net/Web and mobile platforms, as well as an e-commerce infrastructure provider. 
Firms often seek out multiple business models as a way to leverage their brands, 
infrastructure investments, and assets developed with one business model into new 
business models. 
Finally, no discussion of e-commerce business models would be complete without 
mention of a group of companies whose business model is focused on providing the 
infrastructure necessary for e-commerce companies to exist, grow, and prosper. These 
are the e-commerce enablers. They provide the hardware, operating system soft-
ware, networks and communications technology, applications software, web design, 
consulting services, and other tools required for e-commerce (see Table 2.5 on page 
72). While these firms may not be conducting e-commerce per se (although in many 
instances, e-commerce in its traditional sense is in fact one of their sales channels), 
as a group they have perhaps profited the most from the development of e-commerce. 
We discuss many of these players in the following chapters.

Business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce, in which online businesses seek to reach

E-TAILER
Online retail stores, often called e-tailers, come in all sizes, from giant Amazon to tiny 
local stores. E-tailers are similar to the typical bricks-and-mortar storefront, except that 
customers only have to connect to the Internet or use their smartphone to place an 
order. Some e-tailers, which are referred to as “bricks-and-clicks,” are subsidiaries or

divisions of existing physical stores and carry the same products. REI, JCPenney, 
Barnes & Noble, Walmart, and Staples are examples of companies with complementary 
online stores. Others, however, operate only in the virtual world, without any ties to 
physical locations. Amazon, Blue Nile, and Bluefly are examples of this type of e-tailer. 
Several other variations of e-tailers—such as online versions of direct mail catalogs, 
online malls, and manufacturer-direct online sales—also exist.
Given that the overall retail market in the United States in 2016 is estimated to be

even better prospects, because they want shopping solutions that will eliminate the

need to drive to the mall or store (Bellman, Lohse, and Johnson, 1999). The e-tail 
revenue model is product-based, with customers paying for the purchase of a particular 
item.
This sector, however, is extremely competitive. Because barriers to entry (the 
total cost of entering a new marketplace) into the e-tail market are low, tens of thou-
sands of small e-tail shops have sprung up. Becoming profitable and surviving is very 
difficult, however, for e-tailers with no prior brand name or experience. The e-tailer’s 
challenge is differentiating its business from existing competitors. 
Companies that try to reach every online consumer are likely to deplete their 
resources quickly. Those that develop a niche strategy, clearly identifying their target 
market and its needs, are best prepared to make a profit. Keeping expenses low, 
selection broad, and inventory controlled is key to success in e-tailing, with inventory 
being the most difficult to gauge. Online retail is covered in more depth in Chapter 9.
COMMUNITY PROVIDER
Although community providers are not a new phenomenon, the Internet has made 
such sites for like-minded individuals to meet and converse much easier, without the 
limitations of geography and time to hinder participation. Community providers 
create an online environment where people with similar interests can transact (buy 
and sell goods); share interests, photos, videos; communicate with like-minded people; 
receive interest-related information; and even play out fantasies by adopting online 
personalities called avatars. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Pinterest, and hundreds 
of other smaller, niche social networks all offer users community-building tools and 
services. 
The basic value proposition of community providers is to create a fast, convenient, 
one-stop site where users can focus on their most important concerns and interests, 
share the experience with friends, and learn more about their own interests. Com-
munity providers typically rely on a hybrid revenue model that includes subscription 
fees, sales revenues, transaction fees, affiliate fees, and advertising fees from other 
firms that are attracted by a tightly focused audience.
Community providers make money from advertising and through affiliate rela-
tionships with retailers. Some of the oldest online communities are The Well, which 
provides a forum for technology and Internet-related discussions, and The Motley Fool, 
which provides financial advice, news, and opinions. The Well offers various member-
ship plans ranging from $10 to $15 a month. Motley Fool supports itself through ads 
and selling products that start out “free” but turn into annual subscriptions. 
Consumers’ interest in communities is mushrooming. Community is, arguably, the 
fastest growing online activity. While many community providers have had a difficult 
time becoming profitable, many have succeeded over time, with advertising as their 
main source of revenue. Both the very large social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, 
and LinkedIn, as well as niche social networks with smaller dedicated audiences, are 
ideal marketing and advertising territories. Traditional online communities such as 
The Motley Fool and WebMD (which provides medical information to members) find 
that the breadth and depth of knowledge offered is an important factor. Community 
members frequently request knowledge, guidance, and advice. Lack of experienced

personnel can severely hamper the growth of a community, which needs facilitators 
and managers to keep discussions on course and relevant. For the newer community 
social networks, the most important ingredients of success appear to be ease and 
flexibility of use, and a strong customer value proposition. For instance, Facebook 
leapfrogged over its rival MySpace by encouraging the development of third-party 
revenue-producing applications. 
Online communities benefit significantly from offline word-of-mouth, viral mar-
keting. Online communities tend to reflect offline relationships. When your friends 
say they have a profile on Facebook, and ask you to “friend” them, you are encouraged 
to build your own online profile.
CONTENT PROVIDER
Content providers distribute information content, such as digital video, music, 
photos, text, and artwork. It is estimated that U.S. consumers will spend more than 
$23 billion for online content such as movies, music, videos, television shows, e-books, 
and newspapers during 2016.
Content providers can make money via a variety of different revenue models, 
including advertising, subscription fees, and sales of digital goods. For instance, in 
the case of Apple Music, a monthly subscription fee provides users with access to 
millions of music tracks. Other content providers, such as the Wall Street Journal online 
newspaper, Harvard Business Review, and many others, charge customers for content 
downloads in addition to, or in place of, a subscription fee.
Of course, not all online content providers charge for their information: just look 
at the websites or mobile apps for ESPN, CIO, CNN, and the online versions of many 
newspapers and magazines. Users can access news and information without paying a 
cent, although sometimes they may be required to register as a member. These popular 
online content providers make money in other ways, such as through advertising and 
partner promotions. Increasingly, however, “free content” may be limited to headlines 
and text, whereas premium content—in-depth articles or videos—is sold for a fee.
Generally, the key to becoming a successful content provider is owning the 
content. Traditional owners of copyrighted content—publishers of books and news-
papers, broadcasters of radio and television content, music publishers, and movie 
studios—have powerful advantages over newcomers who simply offer distribution 
channels and must pay for content, often at very high prices. 
Some content providers, however, do not own content, but syndicate (aggregate) 
and then distribute content produced by others. Syndication is a major variation of the 
standard content provider model. Aggregators, who collect information from a wide 
variety of sources and then add value to that information through post-aggregation 
services, are another variation. For instance, Shopzilla collects information on the 
prices of thousands of goods online, analyzes the information, and presents users 
with tables showing the range of prices and links to the sites where the products can 
be purchased. Shopzilla adds value to content it aggregates, and resells this value to 
advertisers.
Any e-commerce start-up that intends to make money by providing content is 
likely to face difficulties unless it has a unique information source that others cannot

access. For the most part, this business category is dominated by traditional content 
providers. The Insight on Technology case, Will the Connected Car Become the Next Hot 
Entertainment Vehicle?, discusses how changes in Internet technology are driving the 
development of new business models in the online content market.
Online content is discussed in further depth in Chapter 10. 
PORTAL
Portals such as Yahoo, MSN, and AOL offer users powerful search tools as well as an 
integrated package of content and services, such as news, e-mail, instant messaging, 
calendars, shopping, music downloads, video streaming, and more, all in one place. 
Initially, portals sought to be viewed as “gateways” to the Internet. Today, however, 
the portal business model is to be a destination. They are marketed as places where 
consumers will hopefully stay a long time to read news, find entertainment, and meet 
other people (think of destination resorts). Portals do not sell anything directly—or so 
it seems—and in that sense they can present themselves as unbiased. The market 
opportunity is very large: in 2016, around 265 million people in the United States 
accessed the Internet via a variety of devices at work or home. Portals generate 
revenue primarily by charging advertisers for ad placement, collecting referral fees 
for steering customers to other sites, and charging for premium services. 
Although there are numerous portals/search engines, the top five (Google, Micro-
soft’s Bing,, Yahoo, Ask, and AOL) gather more than 95% of the search engine traffic 
because of their superior brand recognition. Many of the top portal/search engines 
were among the first to appear on the Web and therefore had first-mover advantages. 
Being first confers advantage because customers come to trust a reliable provider and 
experience switching costs if they change to late arrivals in the market. By garnering 
a large chunk of the marketplace, first movers—just like a single telephone network—
can offer customers access to commonly shared ideas, standards, and experiences 
(something called network externalities that we describe in later chapters).
The traditional portals have company: Facebook and other social networks are 
now the initial start or home page (portal) for millions of Internet users in the United 
States. 
Yahoo, AOL, and others like them are considered to be horizontal portals because 
they define their marketspace to include all users of the Internet. Vertical portals 
(sometimes called vortals) attempt to provide similar services as horizontal portals, 
but are focused around a particular subject matter or market segment. For instance, 
Sailnet specializes in the consumer sailboat market that contains about 8 million 
Americans who own or rent sailboats. Although the total number of vortal users may 
be much lower than the number of portal users, if the market segment is attractive 
enough, advertisers are willing to pay a premium in order to reach a targeted audience. 
Also, visitors to specialized niche vortals spend more money than the average Yahoo 
visitor. Google and Ask can also be considered portals of a sort, but focus primarily 
on offering search and advertising services. They generate revenues primarily from 
search engine advertising sales and also from affiliate referral fees.

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
WILL THE CONNECTED CAR BECOME THE 
NEXT HOT ENTERTAINMENT VEHICLE?
You’re in the driver’s seat of your car, 
commuting to work. But instead of 
keeping your eyes on the road, you’re 
watching a Netflix movie, logging on to 
Facebook, and checking your e-mail. And no, you 
are not an accident waiting to happen. 
This scenario is one that is likely to become 
commonplace in the not too distant future. In 
2016, we are on the cusp of yet another revolu-
tion in the way we live our lives, this time driven 
by technology known as the Internet of Things 
(IoT). IoT refers to the use of sensors connected 
to the Internet and cloud computers, coupled with 
powerful data analytics programs, to track things 
and make sense out of their behavior (you’ll learn 
more about IoT in Chapter 3). The technology 
behind IoT already exists, and now businesses are 
working on using it to develop products and ser-
vices that consumers and businesses are willing 
to pay for. 
From a business perspective, IoT is not just 
a collection of technologies, but an enabler for 
services that can be sold to other businesses and 
consumers. For businesses, IoT may mean more 
effective and efficient maintenance, remote moni-
toring of equipment, tracking assets in the supply 
chain, and identifying patterns of behavior of 
machines and operators. These services translate 
into cost reduction, and greater profits for firms 
that truly understand IoT. For consumers, IoT 
means self-driving smart cars, intelligent media 
systems, smart homes, personal health monitoring, 
and retail and e-commerce automation. 
Gartner estimates that 6.4 billion connected 
things are in use worldwide in 2016, 5.5 million 
new things are added every day, and over 20 billion 
will be connected by 2020. McKinsey estimates 
that IoT will produce from $4 to $11 trillion in 
value by 2025, with 70% of this value occurring 
in B2B commerce, and the rest in B2C commerce. 
For suppliers of IoT hardware, software, and tele-
communications, it’s a bonanza of potential sales 
revenue. Along the way, IoT is going to transform 
business processes and enable a host of new busi-
ness models in a variety of different industries. 
One arena that IoT is expected to have a sig-
nificant impact on is the content industry, espe-
cially when coupled with its increasing use in the 
automobile industry to create connected, and ulti-
mately, self-driving cars that will free drivers from 
having to focus on the road. Today, your car is still 
probably one of the least connected devices in your 
digital life, but that is rapidly changing, in part due 
to consumer demand. A recent survey found that 
almost two-thirds of U.S. car owners with broad-
band Internet access in their homes wanted similar 
access in their cars. A connected car is equipped 
with hundreds of sensors and has direct access 
to the Internet, as well as links to hundreds of 
other connected objects. Tiny sensors will be able 
to report on your route and destination, the state 
of your tires, air conditioning, what music you are 
listening to, and in the future, perhaps even your 
state of mind, using sentiment sensors that can 
pick up anger, tears, crying, and laughing. 
The number of connected cars on the road 
is rapidly increasing. According to one industry 
analysis, more than 40 million cars in the United 
States were already connected to the Internet by 
the beginning of 2016. Telecommunications com-
panies are, not surprisingly, very interested in con-
nected cars as platforms for their services and are 
facilitating their development. AT&T, for example, 
introduced an expanded connected car platform in

2016, which allows unlimited plan smart-
phone customers to add their car to the 
service for $40 a month, or $10 a month for 1 
gigabyte of data. In 2016, AT&T also signed an 
agreement with Ford to connect 10 million Ford 
cars using Ford’s new SYNC Connect system. 
AT&T is also working with a number of other 
auto companies to install wireless access devices 
in cars. Aside from selling its wireless network 
to consumers, AT&T is planning to sell data col-
lected from cars and drivers that will allow ads 
to be targeted, based on car model, locations, and 
even the kind of music listened to. 
For content distributors, IoT offers a whole 
new venue. Connected cars provide a poten-
tially huge market for media companies. People 
(drivers and passengers) spend about 500 hours 
in a vehicle per year, including 42 hours in traffic. 
This captive audience is an ideal target for both 
marketers and media companies. Today, although 
we primarily think of cars as transportation, they 
are also entertainment and media centers. For 
instance, cars are already the main source of radio 
revenues in the United States, with more than half 
of all radio consumption taking place in a car. 
But using online radio services in today’s cars is 
most often a painful process that often fails to 
work properly. Both carmakers and content pro-
viders have been hard at work fixing this problem.. 
Pandora Media, seeking to build on its existing 
dominance in the online radio market, has entered 
into agreements with 24 auto brands to embed its 
music service into over 160 car models. Spotify, 
Apple’s CarPlay, and Google’s Android Auto also 
have new services for connected cars. Cars will 
eventually become like a mobile living room, with 
video services that deliver ads along with movies 
and TV shows (currently, for the rear seats only, 
but moving to the front seats in a self-driving car). 
As cars become more and more automated and 
drivers are able to shift from driving to watch-
ing video content, consulting firm EY estimates 
that video industry revenue may increase by more 
than $20 billion. Connected cars are also likely to 
feature enhanced dashboard interfaces that will 
enable easy access to email, music streaming, and 
social networks.
In addition to changing the type of content 
available in automobiles, IoT is also expected to 
have the ability to deliver much more personal-
ized content. IoT sensors will make it possible 
for sensors to recognize individual consumers 
and offer suggested content on the basis of their 
past behavior and preferences. Advertisers are 
already imagining ways to use the shape of a 
car to create immersive, 360-degree ad experi-
ences. To that end, Ford patented a driverless car 
windshield entertainment system that could be 
the basis for this type of advertising as well as 
consuming traditional video content. Other forms 
of personalization could include the ability to 
find the nearest available parking place, locating 
nearby favorite restaurants or other attractions, 
and the ability to take your “driving profile” with 
you from car to car, including preferences and 
tendencies.

TRANSACTION BROKER
Companies that process transactions for consumers normally handled in person, by 
phone, or by mail are transaction brokers. The largest industries using this model 
are financial services, travel services, and job placement services. The online transac-
tion broker’s primary value propositions are savings of money and time. In addition, 
most transaction brokers provide timely information and opinions. Companies such 
as Monster offer job searchers a national marketplace for their talents and employers 
a national resource for that talent. Both employers and job seekers are attracted by 
the convenience and currency of information. Online stock brokers charge commis-
sions that are considerably less than traditional brokers, with many offering substantial 
deals, such as cash and a certain number of free trades, to lure new customers.
Given rising consumer interest in financial planning and the stock market, the 
market opportunity for online transaction brokers appears to be large. However, while 
millions of customers have shifted to online brokers, some are still wary about switch-
ing from their traditional broker who provides personal advice and a brand name. 
Fears of privacy invasion and the loss of control over personal financial information 
also contribute to market resistance. Consequently, the challenge for online brokers 
is to overcome consumer fears by emphasizing the security and privacy measures 
in place, and, like physical banks and brokerage firms, providing a broad range of 
financial services and not just stock trading. This industry is covered in greater depth 
in Chapter 9.
Transaction brokers make money each time a transaction occurs. Each stock 
trade, for example, nets the company a fee, based on either a flat rate or a sliding scale 
related to the size of the transaction. Attracting new customers and encouraging them 
to trade frequently are the keys to generating more revenue for these companies. 
Travel sites generate commissions from travel bookings and job sites generate listing 
fees from employers up front, rather than charging a fee when a position is filled.
MARKET CREATOR
Market creators build a digital environment in which buyers and sellers can meet, 
display and search for products and services, and establish prices. Prior to the Internet 
and the Web, market creators relied on physical places to establish a market. Beginning 
with the medieval marketplace and extending to today’s New York Stock Exchange, a 
market has meant a physical space for transacting business. There were few private 
digital network marketplaces prior to the Web. The Web changed this by making it 
possible to separate markets from physical space. Prime examples are Priceline, which 
allows consumers to set the price they are willing to pay for various travel accommoda-
tions and other products (sometimes referred to as a reverse auction), and eBay, the 
online auction site utilized by both businesses and consumers. Market creators make 
money by either charging a percentage of every transaction made, or charging mer-
chants for access to the market.
For example, eBay’s auction business model is to create a digital environment 
for buyers and sellers to meet, agree on a price, and transact. This is different from 
transaction brokers who actually carry out the transaction for their customers, acting 
as agents in larger markets. At eBay, the buyers and sellers are their own agents. Each 
transaction broker 
processes transactions for 
consumers that are 
normally handled in 
person, by phone, or by 
mail

sale on eBay nets the company a commission based on the percentage of the item’s 
sales price, in addition to a listing fee. eBay is one of the few e-commerce companies 
that has been profitable virtually from the beginning. Why? One answer is that eBay 
has no inventory or production costs. It is simply a middleman.
The market opportunity for market creators is potentially vast, but only if the firm 
has the financial resources and marketing plan to attract sufficient sellers and buyers 
to the marketplace. As of June 30, 2016, eBay had more than 164 million active buyers, 
and this makes for an efficient market (eBay Inc., 2016). There are many sellers and 
buyers for each type of product, sometimes for the same product, for example, laptop 
computer models. Many other digital auctions have sprung up in smaller, more special-
ized vertical market segments such as jewelry and automobiles.
Uber, Airbnb, and Lyft are another example of the market creator business model 
(although they could also be categorized as service providers). On-demand service 
companies (also sometimes called sharing economy companies) are market creators 
that have developed online platforms that allow people to sell services, such as trans-
portation or spare rooms, in a marketplace that operates in the cloud and relies on the 
Web or smartphone apps to conduct transactions. It is important to note that, although 
referred to as sharing economy or mesh economy companies, these companies do not 
in fact share resources. Users of these services are either selling something or buying 
something, and the companies produce revenue by extracting fees for each transac-
tion. However, they do unlock the economic value in spare resources (personal cars 
and rooms) that might otherwise have been lost. In the process they have created huge 
online markets. For instance, Uber (founded in 2009) currently operates in over 480 
cities in 69 countries around the world. Airbnb, founded in 2008, operates in more than 
190 countries and 34,000 cities, lists over 2 million rooms available for rent, and has 
had over 60 million people use its services to book a room. Airbnb has raised around 
$2.4 billion in funding thus far and is valued at $30 billion; Uber has raised over $12.5 
billion and is valued at around $68 billion. 
SERVICE PROVIDER 
While e-tailers sell products online, service providers offer services online. There’s 
been an explosion in online services that is often unrecognized. Photo sharing, video 
sharing, and user-generated content (in blogs and social networks) are all services 
provided to customers. Google has led the way in developing online applications such 
as Google Maps, Google Docs, and Gmail. Other personal services such as online 
medical bill management, financial and pension planning, and travel recommendation 
are showing strong growth. 
Service providers use a variety of revenue models. Some charge a fee, or monthly 
subscriptions, while others generate revenue from other sources, such as through 
advertising and by collecting personal information that is useful in direct marketing. 
Many service providers employ a freemium revenue model, in which some basic 
services are free, but others require the payment of additional charges. Much like 
retailers who trade products for cash, service providers trade knowledge, expertise, 
and capabilities for revenue.
service provider
offers services online

Obviously, some services cannot be provided online. For example, dentistry, 
plumbing, and car repair cannot be completed via the Internet. However, online 
arrangements can be made for these services. Online service providers may offer 
computer services, such as data storage (Dropbox and Carbonite), provide legal ser-
vices (RocketLawyer), or accounting or bookkeeping services (Wave, Bench). Grocery 
shopping sites such as FreshDirect and Peapod are also providing services.1 To compli-
cate matters a bit, most financial transaction brokers (described previously) provide 
services such as college tuition and pension planning. Travel brokers also provide 
vacation-planning services, not just transactions with airlines and hotels. Indeed, 
mixing services with your products is a powerful business strategy pursued by many 
hard-goods companies (for example, warranties are services). 
The basic value proposition of service providers is that they offer consumers 
valuable, convenient, time-saving, and low-cost alternatives to traditional service 
providers or provide services that are truly unique. Where else can you search billions 
of web pages, or share photos with as many people instantly? Research has found, for 
instance, that a major factor in predicting online buying behavior is time starvation. 
Time-starved people tend to be busy professionals who work long hours and simply 
do not have the time to pick up packages, buy groceries, send photos, or visit with 
financial planners (Bellman, Lohse, and Johnson, 1999). The market opportunity 
for service providers is as large as the variety of services that can be provided and 
potentially is much larger than the market opportunity for physical goods. We live 
in a service-based economy and society; witness the growth of fast-food restaurants, 
package delivery services, and wireless cellular phone services. Consumers’ increas-
ing demand for convenience products and services bodes well for current and future 
online service providers.
Marketing of service providers must allay consumer fears about hiring a vendor 
online, as well as build confidence and familiarity among current and potential cus-
tomers. Building confidence and trust is critical for service providers just as it is for 
retail product merchants.

MAJOR BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS (B2B) BUSINESS 
MODELS 
In Chapter 1, we noted that business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, in which busi-
nesses sell to other businesses, is more than 10 times the size of B2C e-commerce, 
even though most of the public attention has focused on B2C. For instance, it is 
estimated that revenues for all types of B2B e-commerce in the United States will total 
around $6.7 trillion in 2016, compared to about $600 billion for all types of B2C e-com-
merce. Clearly, most of the dollar revenues in e-commerce involve B2B e-commerce. 
1	FreshDirect and other e-commerce businesses can also be classified as online retailers insofar as 
they warehouse commonly purchased items and make a profit based on the spread between their buy 
and sell prices.

Much of this activity is unseen and unknown to the average consumer. Table 2.7 lists 
the major business models utilized in the B2B arena.
E-DISTRIBUTOR
Companies that supply products and services directly to individual businesses are 
e-distributors. W.W. Grainger, for example, is the largest distributor of maintenance, 
repair, and operations (MRO) supplies. In the past, Grainger relied on catalog sales 
and physical distribution centers in metropolitan areas. Its catalog of equipment went 
online in 1995. In 2015, Grainger’s e-commerce platform, which includes websites and 
mobile apps, produced $3.3 billion in sales (41% of its total revenue) for the company. 
E-distributors are owned by one company seeking to serve many customers. 
However, as with exchanges (described on the next page), critical mass is a factor. 
With e-distributors, the more products and services a company makes available, the 
more attractive it is to potential customers. One-stop shopping is always preferable to 
having to visit numerous sites to locate a particular part or product.
E-PROCUREMENT
Just as e-distributors provide products to other companies, e-procurement firms 
create and sell access to digital markets. Firms such as Ariba, for instance, have created 
software that helps large firms organize their procurement process by creating mini-
digital markets for a single firm. Ariba creates custom-integrated online catalogs

(where supplier firms can list their offerings) for purchasing firms. On the sell side, 
Ariba helps vendors sell to large purchasers by providing software to handle catalog 
creation, shipping, insurance, and finance. Both the buy and sell side software is 
referred to generically as “value chain management” software.
B2B service providers make money through transaction fees, fees based on the 
number of workstations using the service, or annual licensing fees. They offer purchas-
ing firms a sophisticated set of sourcing and supply chain management tools that 
permit firms to reduce supply chain costs. In the software world, firms such as Ariba 
are sometimes also called Software as a Service (SaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
providers; they are able to offer firms much lower costs of software by achieving scale 
economies. Scale economies are efficiencies that result from increasing the size of a 
business, for instance, when large, fixed-cost production systems (such as factories or 
software systems) can be operated at full capacity with no idle time. In the case of 
software, the marginal cost of a digital copy of a software program is nearly zero, and 
finding additional buyers for an expensive software program is exceptionally profitable. 
This is much more efficient than having every firm build its own supply chain man-
agement system, and it permits firms such as Ariba to specialize and offer their soft-
ware to firms at a cost far less than the cost of developing it.
EXCHANGES
Exchanges have garnered most of the B2B attention and early funding because of their 
potential market size even though today they are a small part of the overall B2B 
picture. An exchange is an independent digital marketplace where hundreds of sup-
pliers meet a smaller number of very large commercial purchasers (Kaplan and 
Sawhney, 2000). Exchanges are owned by independent, usually entrepreneurial start-
up firms whose business is making a market, and they generate revenue by charging 
a commission or fee based on the size of the transactions conducted among trading 
parties. They usually serve a single vertical industry such as steel, polymers, or alu-
minum, and focus on the exchange of direct inputs to production and short-term 
contracts or spot purchasing. For buyers, B2B exchanges make it possible to gather 
information, check out suppliers, collect prices, and keep up to date on the latest 
happenings all in one place. Sellers, on the other hand, benefit from expanded access 
to buyers. The greater the number of sellers and buyers, the lower the sales cost and 
the higher the chances of making a sale. The ease, speed, and volume of transactions 
are summarily referred to as market liquidity.
In theory, exchanges make it significantly less expensive and time-consuming to 
identify potential suppliers, customers, and partners, and to do business with each 
other. As a result, they can lower transaction costs—the cost of making a sale or pur-
chase. Exchanges can also lower product costs and inventory-carrying costs—the cost of 
keeping a product on hand in a warehouse. In reality, as will be discussed in Chapter 12, 
B2B exchanges have had a difficult time convincing thousands of suppliers to move into 
singular digital markets where they face powerful price competition, and an equally dif-
ficult time convincing businesses to change their purchasing behavior away from trusted 
long-term trading partners. As a result, the number of exchanges has fallen significantly.

INDUSTRY CONSORTIA
Industry consortia are industry-owned vertical marketplaces that serve specific indus-
tries, such as the automobile, aerospace, chemical, floral, or logging industries. In 
contrast, horizontal marketplaces sell specific products and services to a wide range of 
companies. Vertical marketplaces supply a smaller number of companies with prod-
ucts and services of specific interest to their industry, while horizontal marketplaces 
supply companies in different industries with a particular type of product and service, 
such as marketing-related, financial, or computing services. For example, SupplyOn, 
founded in 2000 and owned by industrial giants Bosch (one of the world’s largest 
suppliers of automotive components), Continental (a leading automotive manufactur-
ing company), and Schaeffler (a global manufacturer of various types of bearings), 
among others, provides a shared supply chain collaboration platform for companies 
in various manufacturing industries. In 2016, in addition to its shareholders, its custom-
ers include Airbus, BMW, BorgWarner, Siemens, Thales, and many other major global 
manufacturing companies. 
Industry consortia have tended to be more successful than independent exchanges 
in part because they are sponsored by powerful, deep-pocketed industry players, 
and also because they strengthen traditional purchasing behavior rather than seek 
to transform it.
PRIVATE INDUSTRIAL NETWORKS
A private industrial network (sometimes referred to as a private trading exchange 
or PTX) is a digital network designed to coordinate the flow of communications 
among firms engaged in business together. The network is owned by a single large 
purchasing firm. Participation is by invitation only to trusted long-term suppliers of 
direct inputs. These networks typically evolve out of a firm’s own enterprise 
resource planning (ERP) system, and are an effort to include key suppliers in the 
firm’s own business decision making. For instance, Walmart operates one of the 
largest private industrial networks in the world for its suppliers, who on a daily 
basis use Walmart’s network to monitor the sales of their goods, the status of ship-
ments, and the actual inventory level of their goods. 
We discuss the nuances of B2B e-commerce in more detail in Chapter 12.

HOW E-COMMERCE CHANGES BUSINESS: STRATEGY, 
STRUCTURE, AND PROCESS 
Now that you have a clear grasp of the variety of business models used by e-commerce 
firms, you also need to understand how e-commerce has changed the business envi-
ronment in the last decade, including industry structures, business strategies, and 
industry and firm operations (business processes and value chains). We return to these 
concepts throughout the book as we explore the e-commerce phenomenon. In general, 
the Internet is an open standards system available to all players, and this fact inher-
ently makes it easy for new competitors to enter the marketplace and offer substitute

products or channels of delivery. The Internet tends to intensify competition. Because 
information becomes available to everyone, the Internet inherently shifts power to 
buyers who can quickly discover the lowest-cost provider. On the other hand, the 
Internet presents many new opportunities for creating value, for branding products 
and charging premium prices, and for enlarging an already powerful offline physical 
business such as Walmart or Sears.
Recall Table 1.2 in Chapter 1 that describes the truly unique features of e-com-
merce technology. Table 2.8 suggests some of the implications of each unique feature 
for the overall business environment—industry structure, business strategies, and 
operations.

FIGURE 2.3	
HOW E-COMMERCE INFLUENCES INDUSTRY STRUCTURE
E-commerce has many impacts on industry structure and competitive conditions. From the perspective of a 
single firm, these changes can have negative or positive implications depending on the situation. In some 
cases, an entire industry can be disrupted, while at the same time, a new industry is born. Individual firms 
can either prosper or be devastated. 
INDUSTRY STRUCTURE
E-commerce changes industry structure, in some industries more than others. Indus-
try structure refers to the nature of the players in an industry and their relative 
bargaining power. An industry’s structure is characterized by five forces: rivalry among 
existing competitors, the threat of substitute products, barriers to entry into the industry, 
the bargaining power of suppliers, and the bargaining power of buyers (Porter, 1985). 
When you describe an industry’s structure, you are describing the general business 
environment in an industry and the overall profitability of doing business in that 
environment. E-commerce has the potential to change the relative strength of these 
competitive forces (see Figure 2.3).

When you consider a business model and its potential long-term profitability, you 
should always perform an industry structural analysis. An industry structural analy-
sis is an effort to understand and describe the nature of competition in an industry, 
the nature of substitute products, the barriers to entry, and the relative strength of 
consumers and suppliers.
E-commerce can affect the structure and dynamics of industries in very different 
ways. Consider the recorded music industry, an industry that has experienced signifi-
cant change because of e-commerce. Historically, the major record companies owned 
the exclusive rights to the recorded music of various artists. With the entrance into the 
marketplace of substitute providers such as Napster and Kazaa, millions of consum-
ers began to use the Internet to bypass traditional music labels and their distributors 
entirely. In the travel industry, entirely new middlemen such as Travelocity entered 
the market to compete with traditional travel agents. After Travelocity, Expedia, 
CheapTickets, and other travel services demonstrated the power of e-commerce mar-
keting for airline tickets, the actual owners of the airline seats—the major airlines—
banded together to form their own Internet outlet for tickets, Orbitz, for direct sales 
to consumers (although ultimately selling the company to a private investor group). 
Clearly, e-commerce creates new industry dynamics that can best be described as the 
give and take of the marketplace, the changing fortunes of competitors.
Yet, in other industries, e-commerce has strengthened existing players. In the chemi-
cal and automobile industries, e-commerce is being used effectively by manufacturers to 
strengthen their traditional distributors. In these industries, e-commerce technology has 
not fundamentally altered the competitive forces—bargaining power of suppliers, barriers 
to entry, bargaining power of buyers, threat of substitutes, or rivalry among competi-
tors—within the industry. Hence, each industry is different and you need to examine 
each one carefully to understand the impacts of e-commerce on competition and strategy.
New forms of distribution created by new market entrants can completely change 
the competitive forces in an industry. For instance, consumers gladly substituted free 
access to Wikipedia for a $699 set of World Book encyclopedias, or a $40 DVD, radi-
cally changing the competitive forces in the encyclopedia industry. As we describe in 
Chapter 10, the content industries of newspapers, books, movies, games, and television 
have been transformed by the emergence of new distribution platforms. 
Inter-firm rivalry (competition) is one area of the business environment where 
e-commerce technologies have had an impact on most industries. In general, 
e-commerce has increased price competition in nearly all markets. It has been relatively 
easy for existing firms to adopt e-commerce technology and attempt to use it to achieve 
competitive advantage vis-à-vis rivals. For instance, e-commerce inherently changes the 
scope of competition from local and regional to national and global. Because consumers 
have access to global price information, e-commerce produces pressures on firms to 
compete by lowering prices (and lowering profits). On the other hand, e-commerce has 
made it possible for some firms to differentiate their products or services from others. 
Amazon patented one-click purchasing, for instance, while eBay created a unique, easy-
to-use interface and a differentiating brand name. Therefore, although e-commerce has 
increased emphasis on price competition, it has also enabled businesses to create new 
strategies for differentiation and branding so that they can retain higher prices.

It is impossible to determine if e-commerce technologies have had an overall posi-
tive or negative impact on firm profitability in general. Each industry is unique, so it is 
necessary to perform a separate analysis for each one. Clearly, e-commerce has shaken 
the foundations of some industries, in particular, content industries (such as the music, 
newspaper, book, and software industries) as well as other information-intense indus-
tries such as financial services. In these industries, the power of consumers has grown 
relative to providers, prices have fallen, and overall profitability has been challenged. 
In other industries, especially manufacturing, e-commerce has not greatly changed 
relationships with buyers, but has changed relationships with suppliers. Increasingly, 
manufacturing firms in entire industries have banded together to aggregate purchases, 
create industry exchanges or marketplaces, and outsource industrial processes in order 
to obtain better prices from suppliers. Throughout this book, we document these changes 
in industry structure and market dynamics introduced by e-commerce.
INDUSTRY VALUE CHAINS
While an industry structural analysis helps you understand the impact of e-commerce 
technology on the overall business environment in an industry, a more detailed indus-
try value chain analysis can help identify more precisely just how e-commerce may 
change business operations at the industry level. One of the basic tools for understand-
ing the impact of information technology on industry and firm operations is the value 
chain. The concept is quite simple. A value chain is the set of activities performed 
in an industry or in a firm that transforms raw inputs into final products and services. 
Each of these activities adds economic value to the final product; hence, the term value 
chain as an interconnected set of value-adding activities. Figure 2.4 illustrates the six 
generic players in an industry value chain: suppliers, manufacturers, transporters, 
distributors, retailers, and customers.

FIGURE 2.4	
E-COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY VALUE CHAINS
Every industry can be characterized by a set of value-adding activities performed by a variety of actors. 
E-commerce potentially affects the capabilities of each player as well as the overall operational efficiency of 
the industry.

By reducing the cost of information, e-commerce offers each of the key players 
in an industry value chain new opportunities to maximize their positions by lower-
ing costs and/or raising prices. For instance, manufacturers can reduce the costs 
they pay for goods by developing Internet-based B2B exchanges with their suppli-
ers. Manufacturers can develop direct relationships with their customers, bypass-
ing the costs of distributors and retailers. Distributors can develop highly efficient 
inventory management systems to reduce their costs, and retailers can develop 
highly efficient customer relationship management systems to strengthen their 
service to customers. Customers in turn can search for the best quality, fastest 
delivery, and lowest prices, thereby lowering their transaction costs and reducing 
prices they pay for final goods. Finally, the operational efficiency of the entire 
industry can increase, lowering prices and adding value for consumers, and helping 
the industry to compete with alternative industries.
FIRM VALUE CHAINS
The concept of value chain can be used to analyze a single firm’s operational efficiency 
as well. The question here is: How does e-commerce technology potentially affect the 
value chains of firms within an industry? A firm value chain is the set of activities 
a firm engages in to create final products from raw inputs. Each step in the process of 
production adds value to the final product. In addition, firms develop support activities 
that coordinate the production process and contribute to overall operational efficiency. 
Figure 2.5 illustrates the key steps and support activities in a firm’s value chain.
E-commerce offers firms many opportunities to increase their operational effi-
ciency and differentiate their products. For instance, firms can use the Internet’s 
communications efficiency to outsource some primary and secondary activities to 
specialized, more efficient providers without such outsourcing being visible to the 
firm value chain

engages in to create final

E-COMMERCE AND FIRM VALUE CHAINS
Every firm can be characterized by a set of value-adding primary and secondary activities performed by a 
variety of actors in the firm. A simple firm value chain performs five primary value-adding steps: inbound 
logistics, operations, outbound logistics, sales and marketing, and after sales service.

consumer. In addition, firms can use e-commerce to more precisely coordinate the 
steps in the value chains and reduce their costs. Finally, firms can use e-commerce to 
provide users with more differentiated and high-value products. For instance, Amazon 
provides consumers with a much larger inventory of books to choose from, at a lower 
cost, than traditional book stores. It also provides many services—such as instantly 
available professional and consumer reviews, and information on buying patterns of 
other consumers—that traditional bookstores cannot.
FIRM VALUE WEBS
While firms produce value through their value chains, they also rely on the value 
chains of their partners—their suppliers, distributors, and delivery firms. E-commerce 
creates new opportunities for firms to cooperate and create a value web. A value web 
is a networked business ecosystem that uses e-commerce technology to coordinate 
the value chains of business partners within an industry, or at the first level, to coor-
dinate the value chains of a group of firms. Figure 2.6 illustrates a value web.
A value web coordinates a firm’s suppliers with its own production needs using 
an Internet-based supply chain management system. We discuss these B2B systems

in Chapter 12. Firms also use the Internet to develop close relationships with their 
logistics partners. For instance, Amazon relies on UPS tracking systems to provide its 
customers with online package tracking, and it relies on the U.S. Postal Service systems 
to insert packages directly into the mail stream. Amazon has partnership relations with 
hundreds of firms to generate customers and to manage relationships with customers. 
In fact, when you examine Amazon closely, you realize that the value it delivers to 
customers is in large part the result of coordination with other firms and not simply 
the result of activities internal to Amazon. The value of Amazon is, in large part, the 
value delivered by its value web partners. This is difficult for other firms to imitate 
in the short run.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
A business strategy is a set of plans for achieving superior long-term returns on 
the capital invested in a business firm. A business strategy is therefore a plan for 
making profits in a competitive environment over the long term. Profit is simply 
the difference between the price a firm is able to charge for its products and the 
cost of producing and distributing goods. Profit represents economic value. Economic 
value is created anytime customers are willing to pay more for a product than it 
costs to produce. Why would anyone pay more for a product than it costs to produce? 
There are multiple answers. The product may be unique (there are no other sup-
pliers), it may be the least costly product of its type available, consumers may be 
able to purchase the product anywhere in the world, or it may satisfy some unique 
needs that other products do not. Each of these sources of economic value defines 
a firm’s strategy for positioning its products in the marketplace. There are four 
generic strategies for achieving a profitable business: differentiation, cost, scope, 
and focus. We describe each of these below. The specific strategies that a firm follows 
will depend on the product, the industry, and the marketplace where competition 
is encountered.
Although the Internet is a unique marketplace, the same principles of strategy and 
business apply. As you will see throughout the book, successful e-commerce strategies 
involve using the Internet and mobile platform to leverage and strengthen existing 
business (rather than destroy your business), and to provide products and services 
your competitors cannot copy (in the short term anyway). That means developing 
unique products, proprietary content, distinguishing processes (such as Amazon’s 
one-click shopping), and personalized or customized services and products (Porter, 
2001). There are five generic business strategies: product/service differentiation, cost 
competition, scope, focus, and customer/supplier intimacy. Let’s examine these ideas 
more closely.
Differentiation refers to all the ways producers can make their products or ser-
vices unique and distinguish them from those of competitors. The opposite of differ-
entiation is commoditization—a situation where there are no differences among 
products or services, and the only basis of choosing is price. As economists tell us, 
when price alone becomes the basis of competition and there are many suppliers and

many customers, eventually the price of the good/service falls to the cost to produce 
it (marginal revenues from the nth unit equal marginal costs). And then profits are 
zero! This is an unacceptable situation for any business person. The solution is to 
differentiate your product or service and to create a monopoly-like situation where 
you are the only supplier.
There are many ways businesses differentiate their products or services. A busi-
ness may start with a core generic product or service, but then create expectations 
among users about the “experience” of consuming the product or using the service— 
“Nothing equals the experience of driving a BMW.” Businesses may also augment prod-
ucts and services by adding features to make them different from those of competitors. 
And businesses can differentiate their products and services further by enhancing 
their abilities to solve related consumer problems. For instance, tax programs such as 
TurboTax can import data from spreadsheet programs, as well as be used to file tax 
returns online. These capabilities are enhancements to the product that solve a cus-
tomer’s problems. The purpose of marketing is to create these differentiation features 
and to make the consumer aware of the unique qualities of products and services, 
creating in the process a “brand” that stands for these features. We discuss marketing 
and branding in Chapters 6 and 7.
In their totality, the differentiation features of a product or service constitute 
the customer value proposition we described in earlier sections of this chapter. 
E-commerce offers some unique ways to differentiate products and services, such as 
the ability to personalize the shopping experience and to customize the product or 
service to the particular demands of each consumer. E-commerce businesses can also 
differentiate products and services by making it possible to purchase the product from 
home, work, or on the road (ubiquity); by making it possible to purchase anywhere in 
the world (global reach); by creating unique interactive content, videos, stories about 
users, and reviews by users (richness and interactivity); and by storing and processing 
information for consumers of the product or service, such as warranty information on 
all products purchased through a site or income tax information online (information 
density).
Adopting a strategy of cost competition means a business has discovered some 
unique set of business processes or resources that other firms cannot obtain in the 
marketplace. Business processes are the atomic units of the value chain. For instance, 
the set of value-creating activities called Inbound Logistics in Figure 2.5 is in reality 
composed of many different collections of activities performed by people on the 
loading docks and in the warehouses. These different collections of activities are called 
business processes—the set of steps or procedures required to perform the various 
elements of the value chain.
When a firm discovers a new, more efficient set of business processes, it can 
obtain a cost advantage over competitors. Then it can attract customers by charging a 
lower price, while still making a handsome profit. Eventually, its competitors go out 
of business as the market decisively tilts toward the lowest-cost provider. Or, when 
a business discovers a unique resource, or lower-cost supplier, it can also compete 
effectively on cost. For instance, switching production to low-wage-cost areas of the 
world is one way to lower costs.

services at a lower cost

Competing on cost can be a short-lived affair and very tricky. Competitors can 
also discover the same or different efficiencies in production. And competitors can 
also move production to low-cost areas of the world. Also, competitors may decide to 
lose money for a period as they compete on cost.
E-commerce offers some ways to compete on cost, at least in the short term. 
Firms can leverage ubiquity by lowering the costs of order entry (the customer fills 
out all the forms, so there is no order entry department); leverage global reach and 
universal standards by having a single order entry system worldwide; and leverage 
richness, interactivity, and personalization by creating customer profiles online and 
treating each individual consumer differently—without the use of an expensive sales 
force that performed these functions in the past. Finally, firms can leverage informa-
tion intensity by providing consumers with detailed information on products, without 
maintaining either expensive catalogs or a sales force.
While e-commerce offers powerful capabilities for intensifying cost competition, 
which makes cost competition appear to be a viable strategy, the danger is that com-
petitors have access to the same technology. The factor markets—where producers buy 
supplies—are open to all. Assuming they have the skills and organizational will to use 
the technology, competitors can buy many of the same cost-reducing techniques in 
the marketplace. Even a skilled labor force can be purchased, ultimately. However, 
self-knowledge, proprietary tacit knowledge (knowledge that is not published or codi-
fied), and a loyal, skilled workforce are in the short term difficult to purchase in factor 
markets. Therefore, cost competition remains a viable strategy.
Two other generic business strategies are scope and focus. A scope strategy is a 
strategy to compete in all markets around the globe, rather than merely in local, 
regional, or national markets. The Internet’s global reach, universal standards, and 
ubiquity can certainly be leveraged to assist businesses in becoming global competi-
tors. Yahoo, for instance, along with all of the other top 20 e-commerce companies, 
has readily attained a global presence. A focus/market niche strategy is a strategy 
to compete within a narrow market segment or product segment. This is a specializa-
tion strategy with the goal of becoming the premier provider in a narrow market. For 
instance, L.L.Bean uses e-commerce to continue its historic focus on outdoor sports 
apparel; and W.W. Grainger focuses on the narrow MRO market segment. E-commerce 
offers some obvious capabilities that enable a focus strategy. Firms can leverage rich-
ness and interactivity to create highly focused messages to different market segments; 
information intensity makes it possible to focus e-mail and other marketing campaigns 
on small market segments; personalization—and related customization—means the 
same product can be customized and personalized to fulfill the very focused needs of 
specific market segments and consumers.
Another generic strategy is customer intimacy, which focuses on developing 
strong ties with customers. Strong linkages with customers increase switching costs 
(the costs of switching from one product or service to a competing product or service) 
and thereby enhance a firm’s competitive advantage. For example, Amazon’s one-click 
shopping that retains customer details and recommendation services based on previ-
ous purchases makes it more likely that customers will return to make subsequent 
purchases.

Table 2.9 summarizes the five basic business strategies.
Industry structure, industry and firm value chains, value webs, and business strat-
egy are central business concepts used throughout this book to analyze the viability 
of and prospects for e-commerce companies. In particular, the signature case studies 
found at the end of each chapter are followed by questions that may ask you to iden-
tify the competitive forces in the case, or analyze how the case illustrates changes in 
industry structure, industry and firm value chains, and business strategy.
E-COMMERCE TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS MODEL DISRUPTION 
While e-commerce has changed most industries in terms of their structure, processes, 
and strategies, in some cases e-commerce has radically changed entire industries, 
driving incumbent firms out of business, greatly altering the economics of an industry, 
and spawning entirely new firms and value chains (Schumpeter, 1942). When new 
technologies are at the core of a change in the way business is done, they are referred 
to as disruptive technologies. When the technology involved is digital, the term 
digital disruption is used. Usually it is not the technology per se that is disruptive—in 
fact, it can be rather ordinary and commonplace. Instead, the disruption occurs when 
an innovative firm applies the technology to pursue a different business model and 
strategy than existing firms, perhaps discovering a whole new market that existing 
firms did not even know existed (Bower and Christensen, 1995; Christensen and Leslie, 
2000). For instance, personal computers using off-the-shelf inexpensive processors and 
technologies disrupted the market for mainframe and mini-computers. All the eight 
elements of a business model identified previously can be affected by disruptive 
technologies, from the business value proposition to the revenue model, market oppor-
tunity, competitive environment, competitive advantage, market strategy, organiza-
tional development, and management. In short, it’s a whole new world that often 
confuses and surprises successful companies who tend to ignore, dismiss, and/or mock

the early disruptive products. For instance, the entrepreneurs who introduced personal 
computers identified an entire new market of customers that had been ignored by the 
large computer firms, along with new price points, competitive factors, and market 
strategy, using new organizational, management teams, and employees with different 
skills. Many existing firms could not compete, and dissolved. Similar dynamics can 
be found in communications (disrupted by e-mail), data storage, music, photography, 
publishing, and transportation (Lepore, 2014). In 2016, firms like Uber and Airbnb are 
beginning to have a significant impact on the taxi and lodging industries. 
Not all technologies are disruptive (Christensen, et al., 2015; King and Baatartog-
tokh, 2015). In fact, most successful companies use technology to sustain their current 
business models, industry structure, processes, and strategies. This use of technology 
is referred to as sustaining technology because it helps companies to cope with 
competitive pressures and improve their products, and serve their customers with less 
expensive, more powerful, or unique products. But the same technology can be used 
by innovative entrepreneurs (disruptors) to destroy existing business models. Here’s 
how it works. 
Successful companies use whatever technology is available to incrementally 
improve their products, focusing on the customer by improving quality, price, and 
service. The incumbent and dominant firms seek to maintain the status quo in an 
industry, and their firms. In the first disruptive stage, disruptors, often funded by 
new sources of finance, introduce new products that are less expensive, less capable, 
and of poorer quality. The first personal computers used relatively unsophisticated 
technology compared to mainframe computers of the 1970s. These early products 
nevertheless find a niche in a market that incumbents do not serve or are unaware of. 
In the second stage, disruptors improve their products at a rapid pace, taking advantage 
of newer technologies at a faster pace than incumbents, expanding their niche market, 
and eventually attracting a larger customer base from the incumbents’ market. When 
word processors, and eventually Microsoft Office, were married to the more powerful 
PC of the 1980s, they attracted a new market of business managers and professionals 
that was not served by incumbents. The concept was entirely new at the time. The 
successful incumbents never thought business professionals, let alone people working 
at home, would like to have a computer at their desk to create documents, build 
spreadsheets, and make presentation slides. The people and companies that developed 
personal computers were outsiders to the mainframe computer industry. They were 
disruptors. They had the vision. 
In the third stage, the new products and business model become good enough, 
and even superior to products offered by incumbents. In the fourth stage, incumbent 
companies lose market share, and either go out of business or are consolidated into 
other more successful firms that serve a much more limited customer base. Some 
incumbents survive by finding new customers for their existing product, adopting 
some of the newer products and business models in separate divisions of their firms, 
or moving into other often nearby markets. For instance, mainframe computers are 
still made by IBM, but they are one of the few survivors. They survived by sustaining 
innovation in their traditional market of large-scale computing for Fortune 500 firms, 
moving into computing services, data centers, enterprise software, and most recently 
cloud computing, business analytics, data mining, and machine learning. As for the PC

industry, it is currently being disrupted by smartphones and tablet computers, created 
by outsiders who played a small role in the personal computer world, and who have 
identified huge consumer markets that incumbent PC manufacturers did not realize 
even existed. They have the vision, for now, but they face new digital disruptors sure 
to follow. 
Why don’t the existing companies realize the changes that are coming, and take 
steps to compete directly with the disruptors? Successful incumbents usually have 
enormous capital reserves, in-depth technology and intellectual skills, and access 
to prestigious management consulting firms. Why didn’t Kodak see the transition to 
digital photography? Why didn’t Canon see the smartphone camera as a powerful 
competitor to digital cameras? Why don’t firms disrupt their own business models? 
The answers are complex. Incumbent technologists and professionals may be trained 
in an unfit fitness, having the wrong skills for the current environment. Shareholders 
expect returns on investment, not destruction of a firm’s historic and cherished profit-
able products. The existing customer base comes to expect continuous improvement 
in existing products—not a business disruption, but business as usual. These power-
ful practices, all of which make good business sense, prevent incumbent firms from 
meeting the challenges of business model disruption. It is unclear at this time if the 
two most innovative firms in the current e-commerce environment, Apple and Google, 
will prove any different from previous incumbents.

Takes Pandora Public
P
andora is the Internet’s most successful radio service. As of June 2016, 
it had over 250 million registered users (225 million of whom access the 
service via a mobile device) and about 80 million active listeners. Accord-
ing to a recent survey, Pandora is the clear leader among Internet radio 
services, with more than 25% of reporting they had listened to it in the previous week, 
with Spotify a distant second at 10%. Pandora currently accounts for a 10% share of 
total U.S. radio listening (both traditional and Internet). In 2015, it streamed over 21 
billion hours of music!
At Pandora, users select a genre of music based on a favorite musician, and a 
computer algorithm puts together a personal radio station that plays not only the 
music of the selected artist but also closely related music by different artists. Listeners 
have created over 10 billion different stations. A team of approximately 25 profes-
sional musicians listens to new songs each day and classifies the music according to 
more than 450 musical criteria. These criteria are used in a computer algorithm to 
classify new songs into various genres. Within each of these genres are hundreds of 
subgenres. Altogether, Pandora has a database of over 1 million analyzed songs from 
over 200,000 artists.

Pandora’s founders, Will Glaser and Tim Westergren, launched Pandora in 2005.
Their biggest challenge was making a business out of a totally new kind of online 
radio station when competing online stations were making music available for free, 
many without advertising, and online subscription services were streaming music for 
a monthly fee and finding some advertising support as well. Online music illegally 
downloaded from P2P networks for free was also a significant factor, as was iTunes, 
which by 2005 was a roaring success, charging 99 cents a song. The idea of a “personal” 
radio station playing your kind of music was very new. 
Pandora’s business strategy is referred to as “freemium.” A freemium strategy is 
based on giving away some products or services for free while relying on a certain 
percentage of customers to pay for premium versions of the same product or service. 
Because the marginal cost of digital products is typically close to zero, providing free 
product does not cost much, and potentially enables you to reach many more people. If 
the market is very large, even getting just 1% of that market to purchase could be very 
lucrative. Other notable freemium success stories include LinkedIn, a social network 
for career-oriented and job networking that offers some basic services for free, such as 
creating a profile and making connections, but which charges for premium services, 
and Dropbox, a cloud storage and file sharing service that provides 2 gigabytes of cloud 
storage for free, but charges for additional storage. Freemium has been the standard 
business model for most apps, with over 65% of the top 100 apps in Apple’s App Store 
and the most successful mobile gaming apps today using a freemium strategy.
Pandora’s first strategy was to give away 10 hours of free access, and then ask 
subscribers to pay $36 a month for a year after they used up their free 10 hours. The 
result: 100,000 people listened to their 10 hours for free and then refused to pay for 
the annual service. People loved Pandora but appeared unwilling to pay for it. 
Facing financial collapse, in November 2005 Pandora introduced an ad-supported 
option. Subscribers could listen to a maximum of 40 hours of music in a calendar month 
for free. After the 40 hours were used up, subscribers had three choices: (a) pay 99 cents 
for the rest of the month, (b) sign up for a premium service offering unlimited usage, or 
(c) do nothing. If they chose (c), the music would stop, but users could sign up again the 
next month. The ad-supported business model was a risky move because Pandora had 
no ad server or accounting system, but it attracted so many users that in a few weeks 
it had a sufficient number of advertisers (including Apple) to pay for its infrastructure. 
In 2006, Pandora added a “Buy” button to each song being played and struck deals with 
Amazon, iTunes, and other online retail sites. Pandora now gets an affiliate fee for 
directing listeners to Amazon where users can buy the music. In 2008, Pandora added 
an iPhone app to allow users to sign up from their smartphones and listen all day if they 
wanted. By 2009, this “free” ad-supported model had attracted 20 million users. 
After attracting a sufficiently large user base, Pandora turned its attention back 
to its premium service. In late 2009, the company launched Pandora One, a high-end 
version of its service that offered no advertising, higher-quality streaming music, a 
desktop app, and fewer usage limits. The service cost $36 a year. This time around it 
met with much more success, so much so that Pandora went public in June 2011. By 
2016, Pandora had a projected $1.42 billion in revenue with about 80% coming from 
advertising and the remainder from subscriptions and other sources.

However, Pandora has not yet shown a profit, and its stock price has steadily 
dropped since its high in 2014. The company is experiencing slowing growth rates 
and even declines in its number of active users, and competitors like Spotify have 
made gains at Pandora’s expense. Fully paid services like Apple-backed Apple Music, 
as well as much-hyped new entrants like Tidal, founded by Jay Z and a slew of other 
high profile artists, represent threats to Pandora as well. But the picture isn’t totally 
bleak: Pandora has continued to show growth in advertising revenue and in listener 
hours, as its active users are listening more and more. Pandora also made a flurry of 
acquisitions in 2015, including on-demand music service Rdio. Absorbing Rdio signified 
Pandora’s ambitions to directly compete with Spotify in on-demand music streaming, 
as opposed to focusing primarily on its radio model. Additionally, music licensing 
costs were expected to increase sharply in 2016, jeopardizing Pandora’s ability to 
license its music, but a 2015 ruling by the U.S. Copyright Royalty Board raised rates to 
stream a song one time by a smaller amount than expected. After the ruling, Pandora 
made deals with the two largest music licensing companies in the United States and 
continues to make deals with music labels in 2016 as it prepares for the launch of its 
on-demand service.
While freemium clearly has worked to grow companies like Pandora, LinkedIn, 
and Dropbox, there is ongoing debate about the effectiveness of the freemium strategy. 
The crux of the issue is that while freemium can be an efficient way to gather a large 
group of potential customers, companies have found that it’s a challenge to convert 
eyeballs into those willing to pay. Absent subscriber revenue, firms are forced to rely 
on advertising revenues. 
Apple has led a recent push against freemium competitors. Pandora and Spotify 
have thrived at the expense of iTunes Music Store, whose revenues have declined 
steeply for several years, and Apple’s first attempt at a streaming service, iTunes Radio, 
was a bust. Undeterred and sensing a shift in the industry, in 2014 Apple acquired 
Beats, a streaming music service and maker of popular headphones, for $3 billion. 
In 2015, Apple launched its own paid subscription streaming service app modeled 
after Beats called Apple Music, and by offering free three-month trials, quickly made 
significant inroads against Pandora and Spotify. In 2016, Apple Music has more than 
15 million paying users and continues to grow quickly.
Music industry leadership is also unsure about the future of freemium music 
streaming. The heads of Universal Music Group and Sony Music both expressed skepti-
cism of the long-term prospects of the freemium model in 2015, and in 2014, Taylor 
Swift removed her entire catalog of music from Spotify in protest of the freemium 
model, claiming that it devalued her music. Lesser known artists are equally upset 
with the revenue sharing models used by Pandora and other online music streaming 
services, with Pandora keeping about 54% of its revenue and only 4% going to music 
creators. Music labels are optimistic about Apple’s ability to make paid streaming 
work, given Apple’s deep pockets and brand cachet. But industry analysts believe 
that Pandora and Spotify are headed toward profitability as their subscriber numbers 
continue to expand.
Whether freemium services continue to breathe life back into the music business 
remains to be seen, but other companies like MailChimp show how freemium can turn

a company’s fortunes around. The company lets anyone send e-mail to customers, 
manage subscriber lists, and track the performance of an e-mail marketing campaign. 
Despite the powerful tools it gives marketers, and its open applications programming 
interface, after 10 years in business, the company had only 85,000 paid subscribers. 
In 2009, MailChimp began giving away its basic tools and charging subscription 
fees for special features, expecting that users would be more willing to pay for analyt-
ics and other services as their e-mail lists grew. In just over a year, MailChimp went 
from 85,000 to 450,000 users. E-mail volume went from 200 million a month to around 
700 million. Most importantly, the number of paying customers increased more than 
150%, while profit increased more than 650%! 
For MailChimp, freemium has been worth the price. It currently supports more 
than 8 million subscribers worldwide, sending over 200 billion e-mails per year. 
However, Baremetrics, a developer of analytics compatible with the Stripe payment 
processing platform, came to a different conclusion. Though it had historically charged 
even for the lowest tier of its product offerings, Baremetrics introduced a free option 
in 2015. For the full versions of each of the features in the free plan, customers would 
have to upgrade. If judged solely by conversion rate, the free plan could have been 
deemed a success, as over 11% of free plan subscribers eventually became paying cus-
tomers compared to the 3% to 5% that is typical in the industry. However, Baremetrics 
wasn’t able to keep up with the sudden increase in data processing requirements, and 
the staff it had available for customer support requests were struggling to meet the 
higher demand.
Eventually, the total number of Baremetrics customers began to drop below what 
it had been before the introduction of the free plan as frustrated customers canceled 
their subscriptions. Baremetrics discovered that its resources were too tight to use the 
freemium model. Unlike MailChimp or Pandora, whose marginal costs were small 
enough that they could launch their service for millions of users, Baremetrics is a 
smaller company with different goals and scope. Baremetrics has since switched to a 
14-day free trial strategy, after which customers are forced to pick a paid subscription 
plan.
So when does it make sense to include freemium in a business plan? It makes 
sense when the product is easy to use and has a very large potential audience, prefer-
ably in the millions. Using a freemium strategy can be a very successful marketing 
tool, because free features can help attract a user base, and are more attractive to most 
consumers than 30-day free trials that require a cancellation process. A solid customer 
value proposition is critical. It’s helpful if a large user network increases the perceived 
value of the product (i.e., a dating service such as Match). Freemium may work when 
a company has good long-term customer retention rates and the product produces 
more value over time. An extremely important part of the equation is that the variable 
costs of providing the product or service to additional customers for free must be low. 
Companies also face challenges in terms of determining what products and/or 
services to offer for free versus what to charge for (this may change over time), the cost 
of supporting free customers, and how to price premium services. Further, it is difficult 
to predict attrition rates, which are highly variable at companies using freemium. So, 
while freemium can be a great way to get early users and to provide a company with

a built-in pool for upgrades, it’s tough to determine how many users will be willing to 
pay and willing to stay. 
A freemium strategy makes sense for companies such as Pandora, where there is a 
very low marginal cost, approaching zero, to support free users. It also makes sense for 
a company where the value to its potential customers depends on a large network, like 
LinkedIn. Freemium also works when a business can be supported by the percentage 
of customers who are willing to pay, like Pandora, especially when there are other 
revenues like advertising fees that can make up for shortfalls in subscriber revenues. 
The freemium music streaming services don’t have to worry about their business 
model being sound strategy, but they do have to worry about industry goliaths like 
Apple and the record labels taking a stand against them.
Case Study Questions
1.	 Compare Pandora’s original business model with its current business model. 
What’s the difference between “free” and “freemium” revenue models?
2.	 What is the customer value proposition that Pandora offers?
3.	 Why did MailChimp ultimately succeed with a freemium model but Baremetrics 
did not?
4.	 What’s the most important consideration when considering a freemium revenue 
model?

REVIEW 
K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Identify the key components of e-commerce business models.
A successful business model effectively addresses eight key elements:
•	
Value proposition—how a company’s product or service fulfills the needs of customers. Typical e-com-
merce value propositions include personalization, customization, convenience, and reduction of product 
search and price delivery costs.
•	
Revenue model—how the company plans to make money from its operations. Major e-commerce revenue 
models include the advertising model, subscription model, transaction fee model, sales model, and affili-
ate model.
•	
Market opportunity—the revenue potential within a company’s intended marketspace.
•	
Competitive environment—the direct and indirect competitors doing business in the same marketspace, 
including how many there are and how profitable they are.
•	
Competitive advantage—the factors that differentiate the business from its competition, enabling it to pro-
vide a superior product at a lower cost.

•	
Market strategy—the plan a company develops that outlines how it will enter a market and attract custom-
ers.
•	
Organizational development—the process of defining all the functions within a business and the skills nec-
essary to perform each job, as well as the process of recruiting and hiring strong employees.
•	
Management team—the group of individuals retained to guide the company’s growth and expansion.
Describe the major B2C business models.
There are a number of different business models being used in the B2C e-commerce arena. The major mod-
els include the following:
•	
Portal—offers powerful search tools plus an integrated package of content and services; typically utilizes a 
combined subscription/advertising revenue/transaction fee model; may be general or specialized (vor-
tal).
•	
E-tailer—online version of traditional retailer; includes virtual merchants (online retail store only), bricks-
and-clicks e-tailers (online distribution channel for a company that also has physical stores), catalog mer-
chants (online version of direct mail catalog), and manufacturers selling directly to the consumer.
•	
Content provider—information and entertainment companies that provide digital content; typically utilizes 
an advertising, subscription, or affiliate referral fee revenue model.
•	
Transaction broker—processes online sales transactions; typically utilizes a transaction fee revenue model.
•	
Market creator—uses Internet technology to create markets that bring buyers and sellers together; typi-
cally utilizes a transaction fee revenue model.
•	
Service provider—offers services online.
•	
Community provider—provides an online community of like-minded individuals for networking and infor-
mation sharing; revenue is generated by advertising, referral fees, and subscriptions.
Describe the major B2B business models.
The major business models used to date in the B2B arena include:
•	
E-distributor—supplies products directly to individual businesses.
•	
E-procurement—single firms create digital markets for thousands of sellers and buyers.
•	
Exchange—independently owned digital marketplace for direct inputs, usually for a vertical industry 
group.
•	
Industry consortium—industry-owned vertical digital market.
•	
Private industrial network—industry-owned private industrial network that coordinates supply chains with 
a limited set of partners.
Understand key business concepts and strategies applicable to e-commerce.
E-commerce has had a major impact on the business environment in the last decade, and have affected:
•	
Industry structure—the nature of players in an industry and their relative bargaining power by changing 
the basis of competition among rivals, the barriers to entry, the threat of new substitute products, the 
strength of suppliers, and the bargaining power of buyers.
•	
Industry value chains—the set of activities performed in an industry by suppliers, manufacturers, trans-
porters, distributors, and retailers that transforms raw inputs into final products and services by reducing 
the cost of information and other transaction costs.
•	
Firm value chains—the set of activities performed within an individual firm to create final products from 
raw inputs by increasing operational efficiency.
•	
Business strategy—a set of plans for achieving superior long-term returns on the capital invested in a firm 
by offering unique ways to differentiate products, obtain cost advantages, compete globally, or compete 
in a narrow market or product segment.

	 1.	 Select an e-commerce company. Visit its website or mobile app and describe its business model based 
on the information you find there. Identify its customer value proposition, its revenue model, the 
marketspace it operates in, who its main competitors are, any comparative advantages you believe the 
company possesses, and what its market strategy appears to be. Also try to locate information about the 
company’s management team and organizational structure. (Check for a page labeled “the Company,” 
“About Us,” or something similar.)

you have decided to purchase a digital camera (or any other item of your choosing). First, shop for the 
camera in a traditional manner. Describe how you would do so (for example, how you would gather the 
necessary information you would need to choose a particular item, what stores you would visit, how 
long it would take, prices, etc.). Next, shop for the item on the Web or via a mobile app. Compare and 
contrast your experiences. What were the advantages and disadvantages of each? Which did you prefer 
and why?
	 3.	 During the early days of e-commerce, first-mover advantage was touted as one way to success. On the

A
pple has a rich history of dis-
rupting the technology land-
scape, dating back to the Mac 
computer and its revolutionary graphical user 
interface in the mid-1980s. More recently, we 
all know about the impact the iPod, iPhone, 
and iPad have had on our daily lives and on 
society in general. In 2015, Apple unveiled 
its most recent attempt at disruptive, ground-
breaking technology in the post-Steve Jobs 
era: the Apple Watch. While so far the Watch 
has yet to garner the same results as the other 
iconic Apple products, it has sold relatively 
well and still offers strong potential to join 
that group in the future. 
The Apple Watch is one of the latest examples of wearable computing, a fast-
developing field with potential applications in healthcare, medicine, fitness, the military, 
gaming, and many other areas, especially those requiring the use of both hands. Defined 
broadly as any electronic technology incorporated into clothing and wearable accessories, 
examples of wearable technology include wristbands and watches, smart clothing and foot-
wear, and smart glasses. Until recently, wearable technology has been too bulky or unwieldy 
to be useful, but the proliferation of smaller, more compact, more powerful devices and 
the resulting improvements in computing power have made wearable computing possible. 
Analysts view wearable computing as an industry primed for explosive growth in the 
near future. According to market research firm IDC, over 100 million wearable computing 
devices will be shipped by the end of 2016; that number is projected to grow to over 210 
million by 2020. The global market for wearable computing products is expected to grow 
to over $170 billion by 2021. However, the market for wearable computing is so new and 
evolving so quickly that even these projections could quickly become obsolete.
Sensing these trends earlier than most, Apple spent several years building and fine-
tuning the Apple Watch before releasing it. Ironically, one of the guiding principles behind 
the development of the Watch is as a counter to the omnipresence of the smartphone, 
which Apple itself has driven. One of Apple’s goals for the Watch is to act as a filter to 
much of the information overload of a smartphone, only notifying users when truly critical 
information requires attention. As a result, the Apple Watch prioritizes speed above depth

of engagement. In its development, features that required longer than 10 seconds to use 
were scrapped in favor of shorter, more concise interactions. 
Apple also placed its typical emphasis on elegance and simplicity of design when 
developing the Watch, both in its outward appearance and its underlying technology. The 
Watch is equipped with a scrolling wheel called the Digital Crown, which is faster than 
the touch screen for navigation. It also functions as a button that returns users to the 
home screen when pressed. Directly underneath the Digital Crown is the Apple Pay button, 
which allows Watch wearers to quickly pay for transactions. The prominence of the Apple 
Pay button on the Watch suggests that Apple wants the Watch to become a popular way 
to make mobile payments.
The Watch screen is a flexible retina display that uses a feature called Force Touch, 
which allows the Watch to detect the strength of each touch of the screen, performing 
different functions based on the force of the touch. On the back of the watch are four 
sensors, consisting of sapphire lenses and photodiode sensors that can monitor the user’s 
vital signs and movements. Movement is used to control many functions of the Watch; 
for example, when receiving an incoming text message by lifting your arm to view the 
notification, lowering your arm again will hide the notification, saving it for later. The 
Watch comes in three price ranges, Sport, Watch, and Edition. Most Watch wearers will 
opt for the Sport, the basic $299 model, while the fashion-conscious (and deep-pocketed) 
may opt for the Edition, a gold-plated version of the Watch that costs between $10,000 
to $17,000.There are a wide variety of options for watch faces, straps and strap sizes, 
and other add-ons.
Perhaps the most unique feature of the Apple Watch with regard to the user experi-
ence is the Taptic Engine, a form of haptic technology that applies gentle pressure to the 
skin to deliver information and alerts to the user. Wearers are alerted to different types of 
incoming information depending on the number, cadence, and force of the taps. Different 
taps designate incoming phone calls, upcoming meetings, text messages, and news alerts. 
When using GPS, different taps can designate different steps on the route. The Apple 
Watch might someday tap you to let you know that you’re leaving the house without a 
winter coat on a cold day, or that your blood sugar is low and you need to eat.
For the time being, many critics of the device rightly point out that nearly all of what 
the Watch can do, the iPhone can also do, and often do better. On the other hand, because 
of its compatibility with apps and the Taptic Engine, the capabilities of the Watch in 2020 
may be unrecognizable compared to its capabilities in 2016. For instance, sensors in the 
Watch may be used to differentiate the Watch from the iPhone and iPad, although the 
new versions of the iPhone are also being equipped with haptic technology. 
Major retailers and other app developers have lined up in droves to create Apple 
Watch apps, despite the fact that the mobile shopping experience can be quite limited on 
the Watch, and that advertising is limited to ten seconds or less along with all of its other 
features. The device launched with 3,500 apps already available, including many from 
major retailers such as eBay, Amazon, and Target. Some online retailers are experiment-
ing with the ability to bookmark an item on the Watch for future viewing on a phone 
or desktop. Bricks-and-mortar retailers like JCPenney and Kohl’s have also developed

apps, and many of these retailers hope to add features that improve the in-store shopping 
experience for Watch wearers. Users might be able to use a retailer’s Watch app to avoid 
long lines in stores, find items more efficiently with interactive store maps, and pay for 
their purchases with Apple Pay.
Although the functionality of the Watch may currently be slightly underwhelming, 
users appear to be extremely satisfied so far, with 97% of Watch wearers reporting 
satisfaction with their device. That was better than the first iterations of the iPad and the 
iPhone. The Apple Watch is also selling as well as the Fitbit, a popular fitness tool. Fitbit 
is also worn around the wrist, but it’s considered a “basic” wearable because it cannot run 
third-party apps. The Apple Watch may grow to have most or all of Fitbit’s functionality 
along with a host of other capabilities. On the other hand, Fitbits sell for as low as $100 
for older models, and work with all types of smartphones, including Androids. The Apple 
Watch will have to contend with Fitbit and other niche devices from Samsung, Garmin 
and Xiaomi that may sacrifice some functionality for a much lower cost. Although Apple 
has not released recent sales figures for the Watch and instead groups them in a category 
with a host of other products, estimates show that Apple will lead the wearable computing 
market with just under half of market share in 2016. Nevertheless, most analysts project 
that thus far, sales have come in under expectations, and the device hasn’t really captured 
the public’s attention the way the iPad and iPhone did. 
In the early going, Apple focused on making small tweaks, many of which are cosmetic, 
rather than making wholesale change to the Watch. However, in September 2016, Apple 
released the Apple Watch 2, with changes that are both internal and external, including 
a thinner profile, a larger battery, performance enhancements, the addition of extremely 
efficient micro-LED panels to replace its previous organic LED (OLED) screen, and GPS 
capability without the use of a nearby iPhone. As the device continues to mature, the Watch 
is likely to have the functionality that its users demand. Will it be a fitness and health 
tool? The new frontier in mobile payments? An indispensable in-store shopping buddy? A 
must-have complement to the iPhone? Or something completely unforeseen? Apple would 
prefer it be all of these, and become the next great Apple product; but the Watch has a 
ways to go, both in sales and functionality, until it reaches that level of success.

his chapter examines the Internet, Web, and mobile platform of today 
and tomorrow, how they evolved, how they work, and how their present 
and future infrastructure enable new business opportunities.
The opening case illustrates the importance of understanding how the Internet 
and related technologies work, and being aware of what’s new. The Internet and its 
underlying technology are not static phenomena, but instead continue to change over 
time. Computers have merged with cell phone services; broadband access in the home 
and broadband wireless access to the Internet via smartphones, tablet computers, and 
laptops are expanding rapidly; self-publishing via social networks and blogging now 
engages millions of Internet users; and software technologies such as cloud computing 
and smartphone apps are revolutionizing the way businesses are using the Internet. 
Looking forward a few years, the business strategies of the future will require a firm 
understanding of these technologies and new ones, such as different types of wearable 
technology like the Apple Watch profiled in the opening case, the Internet of Things, 
the “smart/connected” movement (smart homes, smart TVs, and connected cars), aug-
mented and virtual reality, and artificial intelligence to deliver products and services 
to consumers. Table 3.1 summarizes some of the most important developments in 
e-commerce infrastructure for 2016–2017.
	 3.1	
THE INTERNET: TECHNOLOGY BACKGROUND
What is the Internet? Where did it come from, and how did it support the growth of 
the Web? What are the Internet’s most important operating principles? How much do 
you really need to know about the technology of the Internet?
Let’s take the last question first. The answer is: it depends on your career interests. 
If you are on a marketing career path, or general managerial business path, then you 
need to know the basics about Internet technology, which you’ll learn in this and the 
following chapter. If you are on a technical career path and hope to become a web 
designer, or pursue a technical career in web infrastructure for businesses, you’ll need 
to start with these basics and then build from there. You’ll also need to know about 
the business side of e-commerce, which you will learn about throughout this book.
As noted in Chapter 1, the Internet is an interconnected network of thousands 
of networks and millions of computers (sometimes called host computers or just hosts), 
linking businesses, educational institutions, government agencies, and individuals. 
The Internet provides approximately 3.3 billion people around the world (including 
about 267 million people in the United States) with services such as e-mail, apps, 
newsgroups, shopping, research, instant messaging, music, videos, and news 
(eMarketer, Inc., 2016a, 2016b). No single organization controls the Internet or how it 
functions, nor is it owned by anybody, yet it has provided the infrastructure for a 
transformation in commerce, scientific research, and culture. The word Internet is 
derived from the word internetwork, or the connecting together of two or more

THE EVOLUTION OF THE INTERNET: 1961—THE PRESENT
Although journalists talk glibly about “­Internet” time—suggesting a fast-paced, nearly 
instant, worldwide global change mechanism—in fact, today’s Internet had its start 
about 55 years ago and has slowly evolved since then. 
The history of the Internet can be segmented into three phases (see Figure 3.1). 
During the Innovation Phase, from 1961 to 1974, the fundamental building blocks of 
the Internet—packet-switching hardware, a communications protocol called TCP/
IP, and client/server computing (all described more fully later in this section)—were 
conceptualized and then implemented in actual hardware and software. The Internet’s 
original purpose was to link large mainframe computers on different college campuses. 
This kind of one-to-one communication between campuses was previously possible 
only via the telephone system or private networks owned by the large computer 
manufacturers.
During the Institutionalization Phase, from 1975 to 1995, large institutions such as 
the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) 
provided funding and legitimization for the fledging Internet. Once the concepts 
behind the Internet had been proven in several government-supported demonstra-
tion projects, the DoD contributed $1 million to further develop them into a robust 
military communications system. This effort created what was then called ARPANET 
(Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). In 1986, the NSF assumed responsi-
bility for the development of a civilian Internet (then called NSFNET) and began a 
10-year-long $200 million expansion program.
During the Commercialization Phase, from 1995 to the present, the U.S. government 
encouraged private corporations to take over and expand the Internet backbone as 
well as local service beyond military installations and college campuses to the rest of 
the population around the world. See Table 3.2 for a closer look at the development 
of the Internet from 1961 on.
	
FIGURE 3.1	
STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNET
The Internet has developed in three stages over approximately a 55-year period from 1961 to the present. 
In the Innovation stage, basic ideas and technologies were developed; in the Institutionalization stage, these 
ideas were brought to life; in the Commercialization stage, once the ideas and technologies had been 
proven, private companies brought the Internet to millions of people worldwide.

computers, and a common addressing scheme for all 
computers connected to the network, are born.
Prior to this, computers could communicate only if they shared 
a common proprietary network architecture. With TCP/IP, 
computers and networks could work together regardless of 
their local operating systems or network protocols.

THE INTERNET: KEY TECHNOLOGY CONCEPTS
In 1995, the Federal Networking Council (FNC) passed a resolution formally defin-
ing the term Internet as a network that uses the IP addressing scheme, supports the 
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and makes services available to users much 
like a telephone system makes voice and data services available to the public (see 
Figure 3.2).
Behind this formal definition are three extremely important concepts that are the 
basis for understanding the Internet: packet switching, the TCP/IP communications 
protocol, and client/server computing. Although the Internet has evolved and changed 
dramatically in the last 35 years, these three concepts are at the core of the way the 
Internet functions today and are the foundation for the Internet of the future.
Packet Switching
Packet switching is a method of slicing digital messages into discrete units called 
packets, sending the packets along different communication paths as they become 
available, and then reassembling the packets once they arrive at their destination (see 
Figure 3.3). Prior to the development of packet switching, early computer networks 
used leased, dedicated telephone circuits to communicate with terminals and other 
computers. In circuit-switched networks such as the telephone system, a complete 
point-to-point circuit is put together, and then communication can proceed. However, 
these “dedicated” circuit-switching techniques were expensive and wasted available 
communications capacity—the circuit would be maintained regardless of whether any 
data was being sent. For nearly 70% of the time, a dedicated voice circuit is not being 
fully used because of pauses between words and delays in assembling the circuit

segments, both of which increase the length of time required to find and connect 
circuits. A better technology was needed.
The first book on packet switching was written by Leonard Kleinrock in 1964 
(Kleinrock, 1964), and the technique was further developed by others in the defense 
research labs of both the United States and England. With packet switching, the 
communications capacity of a network can be increased by a factor of 100 or more. 
(The communications capacity of a digital network is measured in terms of bits per 
second.2) Imagine if the gas mileage of your car went from 15 miles per gallon to 1,500 
miles per gallon—all without changing too much of the car!
In packet-switched networks, messages are first broken down into packets. 
Appended to each packet are digital codes that indicate a source address (the origina-
tion point) and a destination address, as well as sequencing information and error-
control information for the packet. Rather than being sent directly to the destination 
address, in a packet network, the packets travel from computer to computer until they 
reach their destination. These computers are called routers. A router is a special-
purpose computer that interconnects the different computer networks that make up 
the Internet and routes packets along to their ultimate destination as they travel. To 
ensure that packets take the best available path toward their destination, routers use 
a computer program called a routing algorithm.
Packet switching does not require a dedicated circuit, but can make use of any 
spare capacity that is available on any of several hundred circuits. Packet switching

of bits per second, whereas Gbps refers to billions of bits per second.

FIGURE 3.3	
PACKET SWITCHING
In packet switching, digital messages are divided into fixed-length packets of bits (generally about 1,500 
bytes). Header information indicates both the origin and the ultimate destination address of the packet, the 
size of the message, and the number of packets the receiving node should expect. Because the receipt of 
each packet is acknowledged by the receiving computer, for a considerable amount of time, the network is 
not passing information, only acknowledgments, producing a delay called latency.

makes nearly full use of almost all available communication lines and capacity. More-
over, if some lines are disabled or too busy, the packets can be sent on any available 
line that eventually leads to the destination point.
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
While packet switching was an enormous advance in communications capacity, there 
was no universally agreed-upon method for breaking up digital messages into packets, 
routing them to the proper address, and then reassembling them into a coherent 
message. This was like having a system for producing stamps but no postal system 
(a series of post offices and a set of addresses). The answer was to develop a protocol 
(a set of rules and standards for data transfer) to govern the formatting, ordering, com-
pressing, and error-checking of messages, as well as specify the speed of transmission 
and means by which devices on the network will indicate they have stopped sending 
and/or receiving messages.
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) has become the 
core communications protocol for the Internet (Cerf and Kahn, 1974). TCP establishes 
the connections among sending and receiving computers, and makes sure that packets 
sent by one computer are received in the same sequence by the other, without any 
packets missing. IP provides the Internet’s addressing scheme and is responsible for 
the actual delivery of the packets.
TCP/IP is divided into four separate layers, with each layer handling a different 
aspect of the communication problem (see Figure 3.4). The Network Interface Layer 
is responsible for placing packets on and receiving them from the network medium, 
which could be a LAN (Ethernet) or Token Ring network, or other network technology. 
TCP/IP is independent from any local network technology and can adapt to changes 
at the local level. The Internet Layer is responsible for addressing, packaging, and 
routing messages on the Internet. The Transport Layer is responsible for providing 
communication with other protocols (applications) within the TCP/IP protocol suite by 
acknowledging and sequencing the packets to and from the applications. The Applica-
tion Layer includes a variety of protocols used to provide user services or exchange 
data. One of the most important is the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which 
enables the exchange of routing information among different autonomous systems 
on the Internet. BGP uses TCP as its transport protocol. Other important protocols 
included in the Application layer include HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File 
Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), all of which we 
will discuss later in this chapter.
IP Addresses
The IP addressing scheme answers the question “How can billions of computers 
attached to the Internet communicate with one another?” The answer is that every 
computer connected to the Internet must be assigned an address—otherwise it cannot 
send or receive TCP packets. For instance, when you sign onto the Internet using a 
dial-up, DSL, or cable modem, your computer is assigned a temporary address by your

Internet Service Provider. Most corporate and university computers attached to a local 
area network have a permanent IP address.
There are two versions of IP currently in use: IPv4 and IPv6. An IPv4 Internet 
address is a 32-bit number that appears as a series of four separate numbers marked 
off by periods, such as 64.49.254.91. Each of the four numbers can range from 0–255. 
This “dotted quad” addressing scheme supports up to about 4 billion addresses (2 to 
the 32nd power). In a typical Class C network, the first three sets of numbers identify 
the network (in the preceding example, 64.49.254 is the local area network identifica-
tion) and the last number (91) identifies a specific computer.
Because many large corporate and government domains have been given millions 
of IP addresses each (to accommodate their current and future work forces), and with 
all the new networks and new Internet-enabled devices requiring unique IP addresses 
being attached to the Internet, the number of IPv4 addresses available to be assigned 
has shrunk significantly. Registries for North America, Europe, Asia, and Latin

America have all essentially run out. IPv6 was created to address this problem. An 
IPv6 Internet address is 128 bits, so it can support up to 2128 (3.4×1038) addresses, 
many more than IPv4. According to Akamai, in the United States, about 20% of Inter-
net traffic now occurs over IPv6. Belgium leads the way globally, with over 40% of 
Internet traffic converted to IPv6 (Akamai, 2016a).
Figure 3.5 illustrates how TCP/IP and packet switching work together to send 
data over the Internet.
Domain Names, DNS, and URLs
Most people cannot remember 32-bit numbers. An IP address can be represented by 
a natural language convention called a domain name. The Domain Name System 
(DNS) allows expressions such as Cnet.com to stand for a numeric IP address (cnet.
com’s numeric IP is 216.239.113.101).3 A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which 
is the address used by a web browser to identify the location of content on the Web, 
also uses a domain name as part of the URL. A typical URL contains the protocol to 
be used when accessing the address, followed by its location. For instance, the URL 
http://www.azimuth-interactive.com/flash_test refers to the IP address 208.148.84.1 
with the domain name “azimuth-interactive.com” and the protocol being used to access 
the address, HTTP. A resource called “flash_test” is located on the server directory 
path /flash_test. A URL can have from two to four parts; for example, 
name1.name2.name3.org. We discuss domain names and URLs further in Section 3.4. 
3	You can check the IP address of any domain name on the Internet. If using a Windows operating 
system, open the command prompt. Type ping <Domain Name>. You will receive the IP address in 
return.

assemble messages. Messages are broken into packets, and packets from the same message can travel along 
different routes.

THE HIERARCHICAL DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM
The Domain Name System is a hierarchical namespace with a root server at the top. Top-level domains appear next and identify the 
organization type (such as .com, .gov, .org, etc.) or geographic location (such as .uk [Great Britain] or .ca [Canada]). Second-level servers for 
each top-level domain assign and register second-level domain names for organizations and individuals such as IBM.com, Microsoft.com, 
and Stanford.edu. Finally, third-level domains identify a particular computer or group of computers within an organization, e.g., 
www.finance.nyu.edu.

computing to bring about today’s Internet and the Web. That revolution is called 
client/server computing and without it, the Web—in all its richness—would not exist. 
Client/server computing is a model of computing in which client computers are 
connected in a network with one or more servers, which are computers that are 
dedicated to performing common functions that the client computers on the network 
need, such as file storage, software applications, printing, and Internet access. The 
client computers are themselves sufficiently powerful to accomplish complex tasks. 
Servers are networked computers dedicated to common functions that the client 
computers on the network need, such as file storage, software applications, utility 
programs that provide web connections, and printers (see Figure 3.7). The Internet 
is a giant example of client/server computing in which millions of web servers 
located around the world can be easily accessed by millions of client computers, 
also located throughout the world.
To appreciate what client/server computing makes possible, you must understand 
what preceded it. In the mainframe computing environment of the 1960s and 1970s, 
computing power was very expensive and limited. For instance, the largest com-
mercial mainframes of the late 1960s had 128k of RAM and 10-megabyte disk drives, 
and occupied hundreds of square feet. There was insufficient computing capacity to 
support graphics or color in text documents, let alone sound files, video, or hyper-
linked documents. In this period, computing was entirely centralized: all work was 
done by a single mainframe computer, and users were connected to the mainframe 
using terminals.
With the development of personal computers and local area networks during the 
late 1970s and early 1980s, client/server computing became possible. Client/server 
computing has many advantages over centralized mainframe computing. For instance, 
it is easy to expand capacity by adding servers and clients. Also, client/server networks 
are less vulnerable than centralized computing architectures. If one server goes down,

THE CLIENT/SERVER COMPUTING MODEL
In the client/server model of computing, client computers are connected in a network together with one or 
more servers.

backup or mirror servers can pick up the slack; if a client computer is inoperable, 
the rest of the network continues operating. Moreover, processing load is balanced 
over many powerful smaller computers rather than being concentrated in a single 
huge computer that performs processing for everyone. Both software and hardware in 
client/server environments can be built more simply and economically.
In 2016, there are an estimated 1.8 billion “traditional” personal computers in use 
around the world (Cox, 2016). Personal computing capabilities have also moved to 
smartphones and tablet computers (all much “thinner” clients with a bit less comput-
ing horsepower, and limited memory, but which rely on Internet servers to accomplish 
their tasks). In the process, more computer processing will be performed by central 
servers.
THE NEW CLIENT: THE MOBILE PLATFORM
There’s a new client in town. The primary means of accessing the Internet both in the 
United States and worldwide is now through highly portable smartphones and tablet 
computers, and not traditional desktop or laptop PCs. This means that the primary 
platform for e-commerce products and services is also changing to a mobile platform.
The change in hardware has reached a tipping point. The form factor of PCs has 
changed from desktops to laptops and tablet computers such as the iPad (and more 
than 100 other competitors). Tablets are lighter, do not require a complex operating 
system, and rely on the Internet cloud to provide processing and storage. In the 
United States, about 155 million people access the Internet using a tablet computer 
(eMarketer, Inc., 2016c). 
Smartphones are a disruptive technology that radically alters the personal comput-
ing and e-commerce landscape. Smartphones have created a major shift in computer 
processors and software that has disrupted the dual monopolies long established by 
Intel and Microsoft, whose chips, operating systems, and software applications began 
dominating the PC market in 1982. Few smartphones use Intel chips, which power 
90% of the world’s PCs; only a small percentage of smartphones use Microsoft’s operat-
ing system (Windows Mobile). Instead, smartphone manufacturers either purchase 
operating systems such as Symbian, the world leader, or build their own, such as 
Apple’s iPhone iOS, typically based on Linux and Java platforms. Smartphones do not 
use power-hungry hard drives but instead use flash memory chips with storage up to 
128 gigabytes that also require much less power. In 2016, over 210 million Americans 
use mobile phones to access the Internet (eMarketer, Inc., 2016d).
The mobile platform has profound implications for e-commerce because it influ-
ences how, where, and when consumers shop and buy.
THE INTERNET “CLOUD COMPUTING” MODEL: HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE 
AS A SERVICE
Cloud computing is a model of computing in which computer processing, storage, 
software, and other services are provided as a shared pool of virtualized resources over 
the Internet. These “clouds” of computing resources can be accessed on an as-needed 
cloud computing

basis from any connected device and location. Figure 3.8 illustrates the cloud comput-
ing concept.
The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud 
computing as having the following essential characteristics:
•	 On-demand self-service: Consumers can obtain computing capabilities such as 
server time or network storage as needed automatically on their own.
•	 Ubiquitous network access: Cloud resources can be accessed using standard 
network and Internet devices, including mobile platforms.
•	 Location-independent resource pooling: Computing resources are pooled to 
serve multiple users, with different virtual resources dynamically assigned accord-
ing to user demand. The user generally does not know where the computing 
resources are located.
•	 Rapid elasticity: Computing resources can be rapidly provisioned, increased, or 
decreased to meet changing user demand.
•	 Measured service: Charges for cloud resources are based on the amount of 
resources actually used.
Cloud computing consists of three basic types of services:
•	 Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): Customers use processing, storage, network-
ing, and other computing resources from third-party providers called cloud service 
providers (CSPs) to run their information systems. For example, Amazon used the 
spare capacity of its information technology infrastructure to develop Amazon 
Web Services (AWS), which offers a cloud environment for a myriad of different IT 
infrastructure services. See Table 3.4 for a description of the range of services that 
AWS offers, such as its Simple Storage Service (S3) for storing customers’ data and

operating very large server farms and data centers.

•	 Software as a service (SaaS): Customers use software hosted by the vendor on 
the vendor’s cloud infrastructure and delivered as a service over a network. Leading 
SaaS examples are Google Apps, which provides common business applications 
online, and Salesforce.com, which provides customer relationship management and 
related software services over the Internet. Both charge users an annual subscrip-
tion fee, although Google Apps also has a pared-down free version. Users access 
these applications from a web browser, and the data and software are maintained 
on the providers’ remote servers.
•	 Platform as a service (PaaS): Customers use infrastructure and programming 
tools supported by the CSP to develop their own applications. For example, IBM 
offers Bluemix for software development and testing on its cloud infrastructure. 
Another example is Salesforce.com’s Force.com, which allows developers to build 
applications that are hosted on its servers as a service.
A cloud can be private, public, or hybrid. A public cloud is owned and main-
tained by CSPs, such as Amazon Web Services, IBM, HP, and Dell, and made available 
public cloud

providers that own and

to multiple customers, who pay only for the resources they use. A public cloud offers 
relatively secure enterprise-class reliability at significant cost savings. Because orga-
nizations using public clouds do not own the infrastructure, they do not have to make 
large investments in their own hardware and software. Instead, they purchase their 
computing services from remote providers and pay only for the amount of computing 
power they actually use (utility computing) or are billed on a monthly or annual 
subscription basis. The term on-demand computing is also used to describe such ser-
vices. As such, public clouds are ideal environments for small and medium-sized 
businesses who cannot afford to fully develop their own infrastructure; for applications 
requiring high performance, scalability, and availability; for new application develop-
ment and testing; and for companies that have occasional large computing projects. 
Gartner estimates that spending on public cloud services worldwide will grow over 
15% in 2016, to $204 billion (Gartner, Inc., 2016a). Companies such as Google, Apple, 
Dropbox, and others also offer public clouds as a consumer service for online storage 
of data, music, and photos. Google Drive, Dropbox, and Apple iCloud are leading 
examples of this type of consumer cloud service.
A private cloud provides similar options as a public cloud but is operated solely 
for the benefit of a single tenant. It might be managed by the organization or a third 
party and hosted either internally or externally. Like public clouds, private clouds can 
allocate storage, computing power, or other resources seamlessly to provide computing 
resources on an as-needed basis. Companies that have stringent regulatory compliance 
or specialized licensing requirements that necessitate high security, such as financial 
services or healthcare companies, or that want flexible information technology 
resources and a cloud service model while retaining control over their own IT infra-
structure, are gravitating toward these private clouds.
Large firms are most likely to adopt a hybrid cloud computing model, in which 
they use their own infrastructure for their most essential core activities and adopt 
public cloud computing for less-critical systems or for additional processing capacity 
during peak business periods. Table 3.5 compares the three cloud computing models.

Cloud computing will gradually shift firms from having a fixed infrastructure capacity 
toward a more flexible infrastructure, some of it owned by the firm, and some of it 
rented from giant data centers owned by CSPs.
Cloud computing has some drawbacks. Unless users make provisions for storing 
their data locally, the responsibility for data storage and control is in the hands of the 
provider. Some companies worry about the security risks related to entrusting their 
critical data and systems to an outside vendor that also works with other companies. 
Companies expect their systems to be available 24/7 and do not want to suffer any loss 
of business capability if cloud infrastructures malfunction. Nevertheless, the trend is 
for companies to shift more of their computer processing and storage to some form 
of cloud infrastructure.
Cloud computing has many significant implications for e-commerce. For e-com-
merce firms, cloud computing radically reduces the cost of building and operating 
websites because the necessary hardware infrastructure and software can be licensed 
as a service from CSPs at a fraction of the cost of purchasing these services as products. 
This means firms can adopt “pay-as-you-go” and “pay-as-you-grow” strategies when 
building out their websites. For instance, according to Amazon, hundreds of thousands 
of customers use Amazon Web Services. For individuals, cloud computing means you 
no longer need a powerful laptop or desktop computer to engage in e-commerce or 
other activities. Instead, you can use much less-expensive tablet computers or smart-
phones that cost a few hundred dollars. For corporations, cloud computing means that 
a significant part of hardware and software costs (infrastructure costs) can be reduced 
because firms can obtain these services online for a fraction of the cost of owning, and 
they do not have to hire an IT staff to support the infrastructure.
OTHER INTERNET PROTOCOLS AND UTILITY PROGRAMS
There are many other Internet protocols and utility programs that provide services 
to users in the form of Internet applications that run on Internet clients and servers. 
These Internet services are based on universally accepted protocols—or standards—
that are available to everyone who uses the Internet. They are not owned by any 
organization, but they are services that have been developed over many years and 
made available to all Internet users.
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the Internet protocol used to transfer 
web pages (described in the following section). HTTP was developed by the World 
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). HTTP 
runs in the Application Layer of the TCP/IP model shown in Figure 3.4 on page 119. 
An HTTP session begins when a client’s browser requests a resource, such as a web 
page, from a remote Internet server. When the server responds by sending the page 
requested, the HTTP session for that object ends. Because web pages may have many 
objects on them—graphics, sound or video files, frames, and so forth—each object 
must be requested by a separate HTTP message. For more information about HTTP, 
you can consult RFC 2616, which details the standards for HTTP/1.1, the version of 
HTTP most commonly used today (Internet Society, 1999). (An RFC is a document 
HyperText Transfer

published by the Internet Society [ISOC] or one of the other organizations involved in 
Internet governance that sets forth the standards for various Internet-related technolo-
gies. You will learn more about the organizations involved in setting standards for the 
Internet later in the chapter.) An updated version of HTTP, known as HTTP/2, was 
published as RFC 7540 in May 2015 (IETF, 2015). HTTP/2 addresses a number of HTTP 
1.1 shortcomings and is designed to enhance performance by eliminating the need to 
open multiple TCP connections between a client and server (known as multiplexing), 
allowing servers to push resources to a client without the client having to request them 
(known as server push), and reducing the HTTP header size (header compression). 
HTTP/2 will also have security benefits, with improved performance for encrypted 
data running over HTTP/2. HTTP/2 is supported by almost all the leading web brows-
ers, but as of August 2016, it has only been adopted by around 10% of the top 10 million 
websites, in part due to the challenges involved for organizations in transitioning their 
applications from HTTP to HTTP/2 (Akamai, 2016; W3techs.com, 2016).
E-mail is one of the oldest, most important, and frequently used Internet services. 
Like HTTP, the various Internet protocols used to handle e-mail all run in the Applica-
tion Layer of TCP/IP. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the Internet protocol 
used to send e-mail to a server. SMTP is a relatively simple, text-based protocol that 
was developed in the early 1980s. SMTP handles only the sending of e-mail. To retrieve 
e-mail from a server, the client computer uses either Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) 
or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP). You can set POP3 to retrieve e-mail 
messages from the server and then delete the messages on the server, or retain them 
on the server. IMAP is a more current e-mail protocol. IMAP allows users to search, 
organize, and filter their mail prior to downloading it from the server.
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is one of the original Internet services. FTP runs 
in TCP/IP’s Application Layer and permits users to transfer files from a server to their 
client computer, and vice versa. The files can be documents, programs, or large data-
base files. FTP is the fastest and most convenient way to transfer files larger than 1 
megabyte, which some e-mail servers will not accept. More information about FTP is 
available in RFC 959 (Internet Society, 1985).
Telnet is a network protocol that also runs in TCP/IP’s Application Layer and is 
used to allow remote login on another computer. The term Telnet also refers to the 
Telnet program, which provides the client part of the protocol and enables the client 
to emulate a mainframe computer terminal. (The industry-standard terminals defined 
in the days of mainframe computing are VT-52, VT-100, and IBM 3250.) You can then 
attach yourself to a computer on the Internet that supports Telnet and run programs 
or download files from that computer. Telnet was the first “remote work” program that 
permitted users to work on a computer from a remote location.
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) are protocols 
that operate between the Transport and Application Layers of TCP/IP and secure 
communications between the client and the server. SSL/TLS helps secure e-commerce 
communications and payments through a variety of techniques, such as message 
encryption and digital signatures, that we will discuss further in Chapter 5.

Packet InterNet Groper (Ping) is a utility program that allows you to check the 
connection between a client computer and a TCP/IP network (see Figure 3.9). Ping 
will also tell you the time it takes for the server to respond, giving you some idea about 
the speed of the server and the Internet at that moment. You can run Ping from the 
command prompt on a personal computer with a Windows operating system by typing: 
ping <domain name>. Ping can also be used to slow down or even crash a domain 
server by sending it millions of ping requests.
Tracert is one of several route-tracing utilities that allow you to follow the path 
of a message you send from your client to a remote computer on the Internet. 
Figure 3.10 shows the result of a message sent to a remote host using a visual route-
tracing program called VisualRoute (available from Visualware).
	 3.2	
THE INTERNET TODAY
In 2016, there are an estimated 3.3 billion Internet users worldwide, up from 100 
million users at year-end 1997. While this is a huge number, it still represents less than 
half (about 45%) of the world’s population (eMarketer, Inc., 2016a). Although Internet 
user growth has slowed in the United States and Western Europe to about 1%–2% 
annually, worldwide, the growth rate is about 7%, with the highest growth areas being 
the Middle East/Africa and Asia-Pacific (both still growing at over 8%). By 2020, it is 
expected that there will be over 3.9 billion Internet users worldwide. One would think 
the Internet would be overloaded with such incredible growth; however, this has not 
been true for several reasons. First, client/server computing is highly extensible. By 
simply adding servers and clients, the population of Internet users can grow indefi-
nitely. Second, the Internet architecture is built in layers so that each layer can change 
without disturbing developments in other layers. For instance, the technology used to 
move messages through the Internet can go through radical changes to make service 
faster without being disruptive to your desktop applications running on the Internet.

Figure 3.11 illustrates the “hourglass” and layered architecture of the Internet. 
The Internet can be viewed conceptually as having four layers: Network Technology 
Substrates, Transport Services and Representation Standards, Middleware Services, and 
Applications.4 The Network Technology Substrate layer is composed of telecom-
munications networks and protocols. The Transport Services and Representation 
Standards layer houses the TCP/IP protocol. The Applications layer contains client 
applications such as the Web, e-mail, and audio or video playback. The Middleware 
Services layer is the glue that ties the applications to the communications networks 
and includes such services as security, authentication, addresses, and storage reposi-
tories. Users work with applications (such as e-mail) and rarely become aware of 
middleware that operates in the background. Because all layers use TCP/IP and other 
common standards linking all four layers, it is possible for there to be significant

THE INTERNET BACKBONE
Figure 3.12 illustrates some of the main physical elements of today’s physical Inter-
net. Originally, the Internet had a single backbone, but today’s Internet is woven 
together from numerous privately owned networks comprised of high-bandwidth 
fiber-optic cable that are physically connected with each other and that transfer infor-
mation from one private network to another. These long-haul fiber-optic networks are 
owned by firms sometimes referred to as Tier 1 Internet Service Providers (Tier 
1 ISPs) (also sometimes called transit ISPs) (see Table 3.6). Tier 1 ISPs have “peering”

THE HOURGLASS MODEL OF THE INTERNET
The Internet can be characterized as an hourglass modular structure with a lower layer containing the 
bit-carrying infrastructure (including cables and switches) and an upper layer containing user applications 
such as e-mail and the Web. In the narrow waist are transportation protocols such as TCP/IP.

arrangements  with other Tier 1 ISPs to allow Internet traffic to flow through each 
other’s cables and equipment without charge. Tier 1 ISPs deal only with other Tier 1 
or Tier 2 ISPs (described in the next section) and not with end consumers. 
For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to these networks of backbones as a single 
“backbone.” The backbone has been likened to a giant pipeline that transports data 
around the world in milliseconds. In the United States, the backbone is composed 
entirely of fiber-optic cable with bandwidths ranging from 155 Mbps to 2.5 Gbps. 
Bandwidth measures how much data can be transferred over a communications 
medium within a fixed period of time and is usually expressed in bits per second (Bps), 
kilobits (thousands of bits) per second (Kbps), megabits (millions of bits) per second 
(Mbps), or gigabits (billions of bits) per second (Gbps).

Connections to other continents are made via a combination of undersea fiber-
optic cable and satellite links. Increasingly, rather than leasing bandwidth from  Tier 
1 ISPs, Internet giants such as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook are laying down their 
own fiber-optic networks. For instance, Google has one cable stretching from the Cali-
fornia to Japan and another connecting the United States to Brazil, while Facebook 
and Microsoft have allied to lay a cable across the Atlantic, connecting Virginia to 
Spain. The backbone in foreign countries typically is operated by a mixture of private 
and public owners. The backbone has built-in redundancy so that if one part breaks 
down, data can be rerouted to another part of the backbone. Redundancy refers to 
multiple duplicate devices and paths in a network. A recent study of the Internet’s 
physical structure in the United States has created one of the first maps of the Inter-
net’s long-haul fiber network as it currently exists. The map reveals that, not surpris-
ingly, there are dense networks of fiber in the Northeast and coastal areas of the 
United States, while there is a pronounced absence of infrastructure in the Upper 
Plains and Four Corners regions. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has made 
the map, as well as the data that underlies it, available to government, private, and 
public researchers, believing that doing so could make the Internet more resilient by 
improving knowledge (Simonite, 2015; Durairajan et al., 2015).
INTERNET EXCHANGE POINTS
In the United States, there are a number of regional hubs where Tier 1 ISPs physically 
connect with one another and/or with regional (Tier 2) ISPs. Tier 2 ISPs exchange 
Internet traffic both through peering arrangements as well as by purchasing Internet 
transit, and they connect Tier 1 ISPs with Tier 3 ISPs, which provide Internet access 
to consumers and business. Tier 3 ISPs are described further in the next section. These 
hubs were originally called Network Access Points (NAPs) or Metropolitan Area 
Exchanges (MAEs), but now are more commonly referred to as Internet Exchange 
Points (IXPs) (see Figure 3.13). 
TIER 3 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS
The firms that provide the lowest level of service in the multi-tiered Internet archi-
tecture by leasing Internet access to home owners, small businesses, and some large 
institutions are sometimes called  Tier 3 Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Tier 3 
ISPs are retail providers. They deal with “the last mile of service” to the curb—homes 
and business offices. Tier 3 ISPs typically connect to IXPs with high-speed telephone 
or cable lines (45 Mbps and higher).
Three companies, Comcast, Verizon, and Time Warner Cable, together control 
almost half of the “last mile” wired infrastructure in the United States. Other major Tier 
3 ISPs include AT&T, Charter (which is poised to move up the ladder with a proposed 
purchase, currently awaiting federal approval, of Time Warner Cable and Bright House 
Networks), Altice (Optimum Online), Cox, Sprint, and CenturyLink. There are also 
thousands of much smaller, local access ISPs. If you have home or small business 
Internet access, a Tier 3 ISP likely provides the service to you. (It’s important to note 
that many Tier 3 ISPs are also Tier I ISPs; the two roles are not mutually exclusive.)

Satellite firms also offer Internet access, especially in remote areas where broadband 
service is not available.
Table 3.7 summarizes the variety of services, speeds, and costs of Internet access 
available to consumers and businesses. There are two types of service: narrowband 
and broadband. Narrow­band service is the traditional telephone modem connection 
now operating at 56.6 Kbps (although the actual throughput hovers around 30 Kbps 
due to line noise that causes extensive resending of packets). This used to be the most 
common form of connection worldwide but it has been largely replaced by broadband 
connections in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Broadband service is based on DSL 
(including high speed fiber-optic service), cable, telephone (T1 and T3 lines), and 
satellite technologies. Broadband, in the context of Internet service, refers to any 
communication technology that permits clients to play streaming audio and video 
files at acceptable speeds. In January 2015, the U.S. Federal Communications Com-
mission updated its broadband benchmark speeds to 25 Mbps for downloads and 3 
Mbps for uploads. According to Akamai, the global average connection speed in 2016 
was 6.3 Mbps, and the global average peak connection speed was 34.7 Mbps. The 
United States ranks 16th with an 15.3 Mbps average connection speed (South Korea 
leads, at 29.9 Mbps) and 22nd with a 67.8 Mbps average peak connection speed (Sin-
gapore leads, at 146.9 Mbps) (Akamai, 2016c). The FCC found that 17% of all Ameri-
cans lack access to 25 Mbps/3 Mbps service, and that rural America is particularly 
underserved, with more than half lacking such access (Federal Communication Com-
mission, 2015). In the United States, broadband users surpassed dial-up users in 2004, 
and in 2016, there are an estimated 92 million broadband households (over 75% of all 
households) (eMarketer, Inc., 2016e).
The actual throughput of data will depend on a variety of factors including noise 
in the line and the number of subscribers requesting service. Service-level speeds 
quoted are typically only for downloads of Internet content; upload speeds tend to be 
slower, although a number of broadband ISPs have plans that offer the same upload 
as download speed. T1 and T3 lines are publicly regulated utility lines that offer a

guaranteed level of service, but the actual throughput of the other forms of Internet 
service is not guaranteed.
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) service is a telephone technology that provides 
high-speed access to the Internet through ordinary telephone lines found in a home 
or business. Service levels typically range from about .5 to 15 Mbps. DSL service 
requires that customers live within two miles (about 4,000 meters) of a neighborhood 
telephone switching center. In order to compete with cable companies, telephone 
companies now also offer an advanced form of DSL called FiOS (fiber-optic service) 
that provides up to 500 Mbps to homes and businesses.
Cable Internet refers to a cable television technology that piggybacks digital 
access to the Internet using the same analog or digital video cable providing television 
signals to a home. Cable Internet is a major broadband alternative to DSL service, 
generally providing faster speeds and a “triple play” subscription: telephone, television, 
and Internet for a single monthly payment. However, the available bandwidth of cable 
Internet is shared with others in the neighborhood using the same cable. When many 
people are attempting to access the Internet over the cable at the same time, speeds 
may slow and performance will suffer. Cable Internet services typically range from 1 
Mbps up to 500 Mbps. Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Charter, Cox, and Altice (Optimum 
Online) are some of the major cable Internet providers.
T1 and T3 are international telephone standards for digital communication. T1 
lines offer guaranteed delivery at 1.54 Mbps, while T3 lines offer 45 Mbps. T1 lines 
cost about $200–$300 per month, and T3 lines around $2500–$6000 per month. These 
are leased, dedicated, guaranteed lines suitable for corporations, government agencies, 
and businesses such as ISPs requiring high-speed guaranteed service levels.
Satellite Internet is offered by satellite companies that provide high-speed broad-
band Internet access primarily to homes and offices located in rural areas where DSL 
or cable Internet access is not available. Access speeds and monthly costs are compa-
rable to DSL and cable, but typically require a higher initial payment for installation 
of a small (18-inch) satellite dish. Upload speeds tend to be slower, typically 1–5 Mbps. 
Satellite providers typically have policies that limit the total megabytes of data that a 
single account can download within a set period, usually monthly. The major satellite 
providers are Dish, HughesNet, and Exede. In August 2016, Facebook announced plans 
to launch a satellite aimed at bringing Internet connectivity to parts of sub-Saharan 
Africa, but those plans were put on hold when the SpaceX rocket that was to launch 
the satellite exploded while being tested during pre-launch activities.
Nearly all business firms and government agencies have broadband connections 
to the Internet. Demand for broadband service has grown so rapidly because it greatly 
speeds up the process of downloading web pages and large video and audio files 
(see Table 3.8). As the quality of Internet service offerings continues to expand, the 
demand for broadband access will continue to swell.
CAMPUS/CORPORATE AREA NETWORKS
Campus/corporate area networks (CANs) are generally local area networks operat-
ing within a single organization—such as New York University or Microsoft Corpora-
tion. In fact, most large organizations have hundreds of such local area networks.

These organizations are sufficiently large that they lease access to the Web directly 
from regional and national carriers. These local area networks generally are running 
Ethernet (a local area network protocol) and have network operating systems such 
as Windows Server or Linux that permit desktop clients to connect to the Internet 
through a local Internet server attached to their campus networks. Connection speeds 
in campus area networks are in the range of 10–100 Mbps to the desktop.
INTRANETS
The very same Internet technologies that make it possible to operate a worldwide 
public network can also be used by private and government organizations as internal 
networks. An intranet is a TCP/IP network located within a single organization for 
purposes of communications and information processing. Internet technologies are 
generally far less expensive than proprietary networks, and there is a global source of 
new applications that can run on intranets. In fact, all the applications available on 
the public Internet can be used in private intranets. The largest provider of local area 
network software is Microsoft, followed by open source Linux, both of which use TCP/
IP networking protocols.
WHO GOVERNS THE INTERNET?
Aficionados and journalists often claim that the Internet is governed by no one, and 
indeed cannot be governed, and that it is inherently above and beyond the law. What 
these people forget is that the Internet runs over private and public telecommunica-
tions facilities that are themselves governed by laws, and subject to the same pressures 
as all telecommunications carriers. In fact, the Internet is tied into a complex web 
of governing bodies, national governments, and international professional societies. 
There is no one single governing organization that controls activity on the Internet.

Instead, there are a number of organizations that influence the system and monitor 
its operations. Among the governing bodies of the Internet are:
•	 The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which coordi-
nates the Internet’s systems of unique identifiers: IP addresses, protocol parameter 
registries, and the top-level domain systems. ICANN was created in 1998 as a non-
profit organization and manages the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), 
which is in charge of assigning IP addresses.
•	 The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which is an open international commu-
nity of network operators, vendors, and researchers concerned with the evolution 
of the Internet architecture and operation of the Internet. The IETF has a number 
of working groups, organized into several different areas, that develop and promote 
Internet standards, which influence the way people use and manage the Internet.
•	 The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), which focuses on the evolution of the Inter-
net. The IRTF has a number of long-term research groups working on various topics 
such as Internet protocols, applications, applications, and technology.
•	 The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), which is responsible for technical 
management of IETF activities and the Internet standards process.
•	 The Internet Architecture Board (IAB), which helps define the overall architecture of 
the Internet and oversees the IETF and IRTF.
•	 The Internet Society (ISOC), which is a consortium of corporations, government 
agencies, and nonprofit organizations that monitors Internet policies and practices.
•	 The Internet Governance Forum (IGF), which is a multi-stakeholder open forum for 
debate on issues related to Internet governance.
•	 The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is a largely academic group that sets 
HTML and other programming standards for the Web.
•	 The Internet Network Operators Groups (NOGs), which are informal groups that are 
made up of ISPs, IXPs, and others that discuss and attempt to influence matters 
related to Internet operations and regulation.
While none of these organizations has actual control over the Internet and how 
it functions, they can and do influence government agencies, major network owners, 
ISPs, corporations, and software developers with the goal of keeping the Internet 
operating as efficiently as possible. ICANN comes closest to being a manager of the 
Internet and reflects the powerful role that the U.S. Department of Commerce has 
played historically in Internet governance. The United States has been responsible for 
the IANA function since the beginning of the Internet. After the creation of ICANN, 
however, the expectation was the function would eventually be transferred out of 
the U.S. government’s control. In 2006, however, the U.S. Department of Commerce 
announced that the U.S. government would retain oversight over the root servers, 
contrary to initial expectations. There were several reasons for this move, including 
the use of the Internet for basic communications services by terrorist groups and the 
uncertainty that might be caused should an international body take over. In 2008, 
the Department of Commerce reaffirmed this stance, stating that it did not have

any plans to transition management of the authoritative root zone file to ICANN 
(U.S. Department of Commerce, 2008). At the same time, growing Internet powers 
China and Russia were lobbying for more functions of the Internet to be brought 
under the control of the United Nations, raising fears that governance of the Internet 
could become even more politicized (Pfanner, 2012). In 2014, the United States, under 
continued pressure from other countries, finally announced its willingness to transi-
tion control of IANA, provided that certain stipulations are met, including that the 
organization managing the IANA functions not be specifically controlled by any other 
government or inter-governmental organization (such as the United Nations). The 
transition took place on October 1, 2016.
In addition to these professional bodies, the Internet must also conform to the laws 
of the sovereign nation-states in which it operates, as well as the technical infrastruc-
tures that exist within each nation-state. Although in the early years of the Internet 
there was very little legislative or executive interference, this situation is changing as 
the Internet plays a growing role in the distribution of information and knowledge, 
including content that some find objectionable.

further look at the issue of censorship of Internet content and substance.
	 3.3	
THE FUTURE INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE
The Internet is changing as new technologies appear and new applications are 
developed. The next era of the Internet is being built today by private corporations, 
universities, and government agencies. To appreciate the potential benefits of the 
Internet of the future, you must first understand the limitations of the Internet’s 
current infrastructure.
LIMITATIONS OF THE CURRENT INTERNET
Much of the Internet’s current infrastructure is several decades old (equivalent to a 
century in Internet time). It suffers from a number of limitations, including:
•	 Bandwidth limitations. There is insufficient capacity throughout the backbone, the 
metropolitan switching centers, and most importantly, the “last mile” to the house 
and small businesses. The result is slow peak-hour service (congestion) and a 
limited ability to handle high volumes of video and voice traffic.
•	 Quality of service limitations. Today’s information packets take a circuitous route to 
get to their final destinations. This creates the phenomenon of latency—delays in 
messages caused by the uneven flow of information packets through the network. 
In the case of e-mail, latency is not noticeable. However, with streaming video and 
synchronous communication, such as a telephone call, latency is noticeable to the 
user and perceived as “jerkiness” in movies or delays in voice communication. 
Today’s Internet uses “best-effort” quality of service (QoS), which makes no guar-
antees about when or whether data will be delivered, and provides each packet 
with the same level of service, no matter who the user is or what type of data is

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND 
SURVEILLANCE OF THE INTERNET
Hardly a week goes by without 
reports that a massive protest has 
occurred in the streets of a big city 
somewhere in the world. Invariably, the 
Internet, social media, and mobile phones 
are either blamed or praised for enabling these 
popular expressions of discontent with politi-
cal regimes, corrupt officials, unemployment, or 
wealth inequality. Such events encourage us to 
think of the Internet and the Web as an extraor-
dinary technology unleashing torrents of human 
creativity, innovation, expression, popular rebel-
lion, and sometimes, even democracy.
How ironic then that the same Internet has 
also spawned an explosion in government control 
and surveillance of individuals on the Internet. 
Totalitarian dictators of the mid-twentieth 
century would have given their eyeteeth for a 
technology such as this, that can track what mil-
lions of people do, say, think, and search for in 
billions of e-mails, searches, blogs, and Facebook 
posts every day.
In the early years of the Internet and the Web, 
many people assumed that because the Internet is 
so widely dispersed, it must be difficult to control 
or monitor. But the reality is quite different. We 
now know that just about all governments assert 
some kind of control and surveillance over Inter-
net content and messages, and in many nations 
this control over the Internet and the people who 
use it is very extensive.
While the Internet is a decentralized network, 
Internet traffic in all countries runs through 
large fiber-optic trunk lines that are controlled 
by national authorities or private firms. In China, 
there are three such lines, and China requires the 
companies that own these lines to configure their 
routers for both internal and external service 
requests. When a request originates in China for 
a web page in Chicago, Chinese routers examine 
the request to see if the site is on a blacklist, and 
then examine words in the requested web page to 
see if it contains blacklisted terms. The system is 
often referred to as “The Great Firewall of China” 
(but formally by China as the “Golden Shield”) 
and was implemented with the assistance of 
Cisco Systems (the U.S. firm that is the largest 
manufacturer of routers in the world), Juniper 
Networks, and California-based Blue Coat (now 
owned by Symantec), which provides deep packet 
inspection software. A number of other U.S. 
Internet firms have also been involved in China’s 
censorship and surveillance efforts.
Over the past several years, China has 
strengthened and extended its regulation of the 
Internet in the name of social stability. Recently 
passed legislation allows web users to be jailed for 
up to three years if they post defamatory rumors 
that are read by more than 5,000 people. China 
has also issued rules to restrict the dissemination 
of political news and opinions on instant messag-
ing applications such as WeChat, a text messag-
ing app similar to Twitter and WhatsApp. Users 
are required to post political opinions and news 
only to state-authorized media outlets and are 
required to use their own names when establishing 
accounts. In 2016, China issued new rules barring 
foreign companies or their affiliates from publish-
ing online content without government approval. 
It also began to subject online programs to the 
same censorship regulations as regular TV shows. 
In July 2016, it said it would punish websites that 
publish unverified social media content as news, 
and ordered several of the most popular Chinese 
portals, such as Sinu, Sohu, and NetEase, to cease 
original news reporting.

While China is often criticized for its 
extensive Internet controls, other countries 
are not far behind. Iran’s Internet surveillance 
of its citizens is considered by security experts to 
be one of the world’s most sophisticated mecha-
nisms for controlling and censoring the Internet, 
allowing it to examine the content of individual 
online communications on a massive scale. The 
Iranian system goes beyond merely preventing 
access to specific sites such as Google, Twitter, 
and Facebook and reportedly also utilizes deep 
packet inspection. Deep packet inspection allows 
governments to read messages, alter their contents 
for disinformation purposes, and identify senders 
and recipients. It is accomplished by installing 
computers in the line between users and ISPs, 
opening up every digitized packet, inspecting for 
keywords and images, reconstructing the message, 
and sending it on. This is done for all Internet 
traffic including Skype, Facebook, e-mail, tweets, 
and messages sent to proxy servers. In 2016, Iran 
announced that it had completed the first stage of 
establishing an isolated, domestic version of the 
Internet, purportedly one that will be faster and 
less costly, but which subjects its users to even 
more heightened surveillance. 
In Russia, a 2014 law allows the govern-
ment to close websites without a court decision 
if the General Prosecutor’s office declares the 
material on a site to be “extremist.” Russia also 
regulates the blogosphere, requiring bloggers with 
more than 3,000 daily readers to register their 
real names and contact information with Russia’s 
communications regulator. In 2015, Russia passed 
laws requiring domestic Internet companies to 
store their data on Russian soil, allowing the 
government to control it and limit access, and in 
July 2016, passed additional laws that provide for 
mandatory data retention by ISPs and telecom-
munications providers for between 6 months and 
three years, require those companies to provide 
access to all such data without a warrant, and also 
require a government backdoor that will enable it 
to access all encrypted communications.  
Turkey is another country that has increas-
ingly attempted to control and censor Internet 
content. These efforts have increased after the 
terrorist attack on Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport and 
the failed coup against President Recep Tayyip 
Erdogan. 
But it is not just totalitarian nations that 
have sought to regulate and surveil the Inter-
net. Both Europe and the United States have, at 
various times, also taken steps to control access to 
certain websites, censor web content, and engage 
in extensive surveillance of communications. For 
instance, Great Britain has a list of blocked sites, 
as do Germany, France, and Australia. The United 
States and European countries generally ban 
the sale, distribution, and/or possession of online 
child pornography. France, Germany, and Austria 
all bar the online sale of Nazi memorabilia. Even 
in South Korea, one of the world’s most wired 
countries, there are restrictions on content that 
is deemed subversive and harmful to the public 
order. 
In response to terrorism threats and other 
crimes, European governments and the U.S. 
government also perform deep packet inspection 
on e-mail and text communications of terrorist 
suspects. This surveillance is not limited to cross-
border international data flows and includes 
large-scale domestic surveillance and analysis 
of routine e-mail, tweets, and other messages. In 
2013, National Security Agency (NSA) contrac-
tor Edward Snowden made headlines by leaking 
classified NSA documents shedding light on 
the NSA’s PRISM program, which allowed the 
agency access to the servers of major Internet 
companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple, 
Microsoft, and many others. Additionally, the 
documents revealed the existence of the NSA’s 
XKeyscore program, which allows analysts to 
search databases of e-mails, chats, and browsing 
histories of individual citizens without any autho-
rization. Warrants, court clearance, or other forms 
of legal documentation are not required for ana-

also showed spy agencies were tapping data from 
smartphone apps like Candy Crush, and most 
others, and that the NSA was tapping the flow 
of personal user information between Google and 
Yahoo. The NSA claimed that the program was 
only used to monitor foreign intelligence targets 
and that the information it collects has assisted 
in apprehending terrorists. The FBI also has an 
Internet surveillance unit, the National Domestic 
Communications Assistance Center. The NDCAC’s 
mission is to assist in the development of new sur-
veillance technologies that will allow authorities 
to increase the interception of Internet, wireless, 
and VoIP communications.
In 2016, many European powers moved 
ahead with plans to fortify their online surveil-
lance with new start-of-the-art networks. In 
England, potential new laws would force Internet 
service companies to maintain “Internet connec-
tion records” that would be subject to review 
by law enforcement at any time. In response to 
multiple terror attacks on French soils in 2015, 
the French government passed very similar rules 
that force ISPs to maintain browsing data, as 
well as additional provisions for surveillance of 
phone calls, e-mails, and all mobile phone com-
munications. And De-Cix, the world’s largest 
IXP, pushed back against the German govern-
ment regarding requests to allow surveillance 
of all communications passing through 
its Frankfurt hub. De-Cix sued the German 
intelligence service for what it views as illegal 
overreach, but the German government hopes to 
pass new laws that would legitimize the practice, 
just as England, France, and other nations have 
done.
However, in the United States, efforts are 
underway to curb domestic and international 
counter-terrorist agencies like the NSA from 
conducting dragnet surveillance of the entire 
American population, strengthen court oversight 
of surveillance, limit surveillance to specific indi-
viduals, and ease disclosure rules for Internet 
firms who receive requests from government agen-
cies. In 2015, Congress passed the USA Freedom 
Act, which limits the bulk collection of Americans’ 
phone records. However, equally concerted efforts 
are underway to expand these types of spying 
powers. For instance, the Obama administration 
has expanded the NSA’s ability to perform war-
rantless wiretaps on suspected malicious hackers, 
allowing them to monitor international Internet 
traffic from these suspects as well as domestic 
traffic. Concerns about the use of the Internet 
and other methods of encrypted communications 
by the Islamic State to recruit new members and 
engage in terrorism have further heightened the 
tension.

is to keep expanding into new services, such as video on demand and telephony.
•	 Network architecture limitations. Today, a thousand requests for a single music track 
from a central server will result in a thousand efforts by the server to download 
the music to each requesting client. This slows down network performance, as the 
same music track is sent out a thousand times to clients that might be located in the 
same metropolitan area. This is very different from television, where the program 
is broadcast once to millions of homes.
•	 Wired Internet. The Internet is still largely based on cables—fiber-optic and coaxial 
copper cables. Copper cables use a centuries-old technology, and fiber-optic cable is 
expensive to place underground. The wired nature of the Internet restricts mobility 
of users although it is changing rapidly as Wi-Fi hotspots proliferate, and cellular 
phone technology advances. However, cellular systems are often overloaded due 
to the growth in the number of smartphones.
Now imagine an Internet at least 1,000 times as powerful as today’s Internet, one 
that is not subjected to the limitations of bandwidth, protocols, architecture, physical 
connections, and language detailed previously. Welcome to the world of the future 
Internet, and the next generation of e-commerce services and products!
THE INTERNET2® PROJECT
Internet2® is an advanced networking consortium of more than 450 member institu-
tions including universities, corporations, government research agencies, and not-for-
profit networking organizations, all working in partnership to facilitate the 
development, deployment, and use of revolutionary Internet technologies. The broader 
Internet2 community includes more than 90,000 institutions across the United States 
and international networking partners in more than 100 countries. Internet2’s work 
is a continuation of the kind of cooperation among government, private, and educa-
tional organizations that created the original Internet.
The advanced networks created and in use by Internet2 members provide an 
environment in which new technologies can be tested and enhanced. For instance, 
Internet2 provides a next-generation, nationwide 100 gigabit-per-second network that 
not only makes available a reliable production services platform for current high-
performance needs but also creates a powerful experimental platform for the develop-
ment of new network capabilities. See Table 3.9 to get some sense of just how fast a 
100-Gbps network is in terms of data transmission times. The fourth generation of this 
network, built through a federal stimulus grant from the National Telecommunications 
and Information Administration’s Broadband Technology Opportunities Program, has 
now been deployed. The hybrid optical and packet network provides 8.8 terabits of 
capacity with the ability to seamlessly scale as requirements grow, includes over 15,000 
miles of owned fiber optic cable, and reaches into underserved areas of the country, 
supporting connectivity for approximately 200,000 U.S. community anchor institutions 
(schools, local libraries, and museums), and enabling them to provide citizens across 
the country with telemedicine, distance learning, and other advanced applications not 
possible with consumer-grade Internet services. The infrastructure supports a wide 
range of IP and optical services already available today and also will stimulate a new

XSEDE is a collection of integrated, advanced digital resources and services that enables 
scientists to interactively share computing resources, data, and expertise. XSEDE supports 
over 8,000 members of the scientific community, and 16 supercomputers. In 2013, XSEDE 
upgraded from a 10-Gbps network to Internet2’s 100-Gbps network. In 2016, the NSF 
awarded XSEDE $110 million in funding to enable it to continue to provide advanced 
cyberinfrastructure resources and services to the nation’s scientists and engineers.

that will enable researchers, scientists, and others to “turn on” high-capacity network 
connections whenever and wherever they are needed. Table 3.10 describes some of 
the projects that Internet2’s 100-Gbps network is enabling. Other initiatives involve 
science and engineering (advanced network applications in support of distributed lab 
environments, remote access to rare scientific instruments, and distributed large-scale 
computation and data access), health sciences and health networks (telemedicine, 
medical and biological research, and health education and awareness), and arts and 
humanities (collaborative live performances, master classes, remote auditions, and 
interactive performing arts education and media events).
THE FIRST MILE AND THE LAST MILE
The Internet2 project is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to future enhance-
ments to the Internet. In 2007, the NSF began work on the Global Environment for 
Network Innovations (GENI) initiative. GENI is a unique virtual laboratory for explor-
ing future internets at scale. GENI aims to promote innovations in network science, 
security technologies, services, and applications. GENI is a partnership of leading

academic centers and private corporations such as Cisco, IBM, and HP, among many 
others. To date, awards have been made to 83 academic/industry teams for various 
projects to build, integrate, and operate early prototypes of the GENI virtual laboratory 
(Geni.net, 2014). Between 2015 and 2017, GENI will transition from being overseen 
by NSF’s GENI Project Office to a community governance model (Geni.net, 2016).
The most significant privately initiated (but often government-influenced) 
changes are coming in two areas: fiber-optic trunk line bandwidth and wireless Inter-
net services. Fiber optics is concerned with the first mile or backbone Internet services 
that carry bulk traffic long distances. Wireless Internet is concerned with the last 
mile—from the larger Internet to the user’s smartphone, tablet computer, or laptop.
Fiber Optics and the Bandwidth Explosion in the First Mile
Fiber-optic cable consists of up to hundreds of strands of glass that use light to 
transmit data. It often replaces existing coaxial and twisted pair cabling because it can 
transmit much more data at faster speeds, with less interference and better data 
security. Fiber-optic cable is also thinner and lighter, taking up less space during 
installation. The hope is to use fiber optics to expand network bandwidth capacity in 
order to prepare for the expected increases in web traffic once next-generation Internet 
services are widely adopted.
Telecommunication firms have made substantial investments in global, national, 
and regional fiber optic cable systems in the last decade. For instance, Verizon has 
spent over $23 billion since 2004, building and expanding its FiOS fiber-optic Internet 
service that can provide speeds of up to 500 Mbps, and currently has about 6.6 million 
FiOS customers. In 2012, Google joined the fray with Google Fiber, a 1-Gbps fiber-
optic network, that is currently available in 7 cities. This installed base of fiber-optic 
cable represents a vast digital highway that is currently being exploited by YouTube 
(Google), Facebook, and other high-bandwidth applications. But despite the interest 
in fiber, only about 12.3% of U.S. homes had fiber connections as of 2015, a much 
lower percentage than a number of other countries around the world (Buckley, 2015; 
Richter, 2016). Table 3.11 illustrates several optical bandwidth standards and compares 
them to traditional T lines.
The Last Mile: Mobile Internet Access
Fiber-optic networks carry the long-haul bulk traffic of the Internet and play an impor-
tant role in bringing high-speed broadband to the household and small business. The 
goal of the Internet2 and GENI projects is to bring gigabit and ultimately terabit band-
width to the household over the next 20 years. But along with fiber optics, arguably 
the most significant development for the Internet and Web has been the emergence 
of mobile Internet access.
Wireless Internet is concerned with the last mile of Internet access to the user’s 
home, office, car, smartphone, or tablet computer, anywhere they are located. Up 
until 2000, the last-mile access to the Internet—with the exception of a small satellite 
Internet connect population—was bound up in land lines of some sort: copper coaxial 
TV cables or telephone lines or, in some cases, fiber-optic lines to the office. Today, 
fiber-optic cable
consists of up to hundreds 
of strands of glass or 
plastic that use light to 
transmit data

in comparison, high-speed cell phone networks and Wi-Fi network hotspots provide 
a major alternative.
Today, sales of desktop computers have been eclipsed by sales of smartphones and 
tablet and ultramobile laptop computers with built-in wireless networking functional-
ity. Clearly, a large part of the Internet is now mobile, access-anywhere broadband 
service for the delivery of video, music, and web search. According to eMarketer, there 
are over 210 million mobile Internet users in the United States in 2016 (about 65% of 
the population), and almost 2.5 billion worldwide (eMarketer, Inc., 2016f).
Telephone-based versus Computer Network-based Wireless Internet Access
There are two different basic types of wireless Internet connectivity: telephone-based 
and computer network-based systems.
Telephone-based wireless Internet access connects the user to a global telephone 
system (land, satellite, and microwave) that has a long history of dealing with mil-
lions of users simultaneously and already has in place a large-scale transaction billing 
system and related infrastructure. Cellular telephones and the telephone industry are 
currently the largest providers of wireless access to the Internet today. Around 1.5 
billion smartphones are expected to be sold worldwide in 2016 (Gartner, Inc., 2016b). 
Smartphones combine the functionality of a cell phone with that of a laptop computer 
with Wi-Fi capability. This makes it possible to combine in one device music, video, 
web access, and telephone service. Tablet computers can also access cellular networks. 
Table 3.12 summarizes the various telephone technologies currently being used 
and under development for wireless Internet access. 5G wireless is the next frontier. 
Although official standards are not expected to be fully rolled out for a few years, 
telecommunications companies will likely start to introduce technology branded as 
“5G” as soon as 2017.

Wireless local area network (WLAN)-based Internet access derives from a completely 
different background from telephone-based wireless Internet access. Popularly known 
as Wi-Fi, WLANs are based on computer local area networks where the task is to 
connect client computers (generally stationary) to server computers within local areas 
of, say, a few hundred meters. Wi-Fi functions by sending radio signals that are broad-
cast over the airwaves using certain radio frequency ranges (2.4 GHz to 5.875 GHz, 
depending on the type of standard involved). The major technologies here are the 
various versions of the Wi-Fi standard, WiMax, and Bluetooth (see Table 3.13).
In a Wi-Fi network, a wireless access point (also known as a “hot spot”) connects 
to the Internet directly via a broadband connection (cable, DSL telephone, or T1 line) 
and then transmits a radio signal to a transmitter/receiver installed in a tablet or 
laptop computer or smartphone. Figure 3.14 illustrates how a Wi-Fi network works.
Wi-Fi provided under the 802.11 a/b/g/n specifications offers high-bandwidth 
capacity from 11 Mbps up to a maximum of 7 Gbps—far greater than any 3G or 4G 
service currently in existence—but has a limited range of 300 meters, with the excep-
tion of WiMax discussed below. Wi-Fi is also exceptionally inexpensive. The cost of 
creating a corporate Wi-Fi network in a single 14-story building with an access point 
for each floor is less than $100 an access point. It would cost well over $500,000 to

the IEEE 802.11 Working Group include 802.11ay, which deals with 60 GHz wireless 
operations, and will provide for data rates of up to 20 Gbps, and 802.11ax, aimed at 
high-efficiency WLANs used for stadiums and other areas where many people want to 
access a Wi-Fi network at the same time. A next-generation 802.11ah standard aimed 
at the Internet of Things is also being developed (Weiss, 2015; Hsu, 2015).
While initially a grass roots, “hippies and hackers” public access technology, bil-
lions of dollars have subsequently been poured into private ventures seeking to create 
for-profit Wi-Fi networks. One of the most prominent networks has been created by 
Boingo Wireless with more than 1 million hotspots around the globe. Optimum WiFi 
(available to Optimum Online customers for free) also offers over 1.5 million hotspots 
around the world. AT&T Wi-Fi Services (formerly Wayport) has another large network 
that provides Wi-Fi service at hotels, airports, McDonald’s, and IHOP restaurants, and 
Hertz airport rental offices, with thousands of hotspots throughout the United States. 
T-Mobile and Sprint also have nationwide Wi-Fi services at Starbucks coffee shops 
and thousands of other public locations. Apple, in turn, has made Wi-Fi automatically 
available to iPhone and iPad devices as an alternative to the more expensive and 
much slower 3G and 4G cellular systems. In 2015, for the first time, a majority (51%) 
of mobile Internet traffic originated from Wi-Fi rather than cellular systems, and it 
is expected that Wi-Fi will be carrying over half of all Internet traffic by 2019 (Cisco, 
2016).
A second WLAN technology for connecting to the Internet, and for connecting 
Internet devices to one another, is called Bluetooth. Bluetooth is a personal connectiv-
ity technology that enables links between mobile devices and connectivity to the 
Internet (Bluetooth.com, 2016). Bluetooth is the universal cable cutter, promising to 
get rid of the tangled mess of wires, cradles, and special attachments that plague the 
current world of personal computing. With Bluetooth, users can wear a wireless 
earbud, share files in a hallway or conference room, synchronize their smartphone 
with their laptop without a cable, send a document to a printer, and even pay a res-
taurant bill from the table to a Bluetooth-equipped cash register. Bluetooth is also an 
unregulated media operating in the 2.4 GHz spectrum but with a very limited range 
of 30 feet or less. It uses a frequency hopping signal with up to 1,600 hops per second 
over 79 frequencies, giving it good protection from interference and interception. 
Bluetooth-equipped devices constantly scan their environments looking for connec-
tions to compatible devices. Today, almost all mobile devices are Bluetooth-enabled. 
Bluetooth may also play a role in the future as a platform for the Internet of Things 
(see page 152).
INTERNET ACCESS DRONES
A new method of providing Internet access to areas that are not well served by wired 
or cellular networks is being explored by companies such as Google and Facebook. 
Both companies have recently purchased companies that make drones (unmanned 
aircraft/satellites) that may be used to provide Internet access to remote parts of the 
world.
In 2014, Google purchased Titan Aerospace, which makes solar-powered drones 
that can fly for several years at 65,000 feet. Google is reportedly experimenting with 
Bluetooth
technology standard for 
short-range wireless 
communication under 30 
feet

using drones to deliver 5G wireless Internet service. Google is also experimenting with 
high-altitude balloons with its Project Loon. Google envisions a network of balloons 
circling high above the earth in the stratosphere, establishing a ring of uninterrupted 
connectivity. In 2014, Google sent a prototype of a networked hot-air balloon around 
the world in 22 days, even taking photos for its Street View program, and in 2015, the 
government of Sri Lanka announced that Sri Lanka would be the first country to use 
Project Loon to provide universal Internet access across Sri Lanka. In August 2016, 
Google is reportedly taking steps to move Project Loon from a research project into 
a profitable business.
In a similar effort, Facebook has put together the Facebook Connectivity Lab, 
where engineers are focusing on solar-powered drones, satellites, and infrared lasers 
capable of providing Internet access. To propel that effort, Facebook purchased the 
British company Ascenta, whose founders helped create the world’s longest flying 
solar-powered drone. In 2016, Facebook completed a full-scale test flight of its first 
Internet access solar-powered drone, Aquila. Created from carbon fiber, the drone 
has the wingspan of a Boeing 737 but weighs less than a small car, and is designed to 
fly at 60,000 to 90,000 feet for up to three months at a time. It reportedly uses a laser 
communications system that can beam data from the sky.
THE FUTURE INTERNET
The increased bandwidth and expanded wireless network connectivity of the Internet 
of the future will result in benefits beyond faster access and richer communications. 
First-mile enhancements created by fiber-optic networks will enhance reliability and 
quality of Internet transmissions and create new business models and opportunities. 
Some of the major benefits of these technological advancements include latency solu-
tions, guaranteed service levels, lower error rates, and declining costs. Widespread 
wireless access to the Internet will also essentially double or even triple the size of 
the online shopping marketspace because consumers will be able to shop and make 
purchases just about anywhere. This is equivalent to doubling the physical floor space 
of all shopping malls in America. We describe some of these benefits in more detail 
in the following sections.
Latency Solutions
One of the challenges of packet switching, where data is divided into chunks and then 
sent separately to meet again at the destination, is that the Internet does not differenti-
ate between high-priority packets, such as video clips, and those of lower priority, such 
as self-contained e-mail messages. Because the packets cannot yet be simultaneously 
reassembled, the result can be distorted audio and video streams.
Differentiated quality of service (diffserv) is a technology that assigns levels 
of priority to packets based on the type of data being transmitted. Video conference 
packets, for example, which need to reach their destination almost instantaneously, 
receive much higher priority than e-mail messages. In the end, the quality of video 
and audio will skyrocket without undue stress on the network. Differential service is 
very controversial because it means some users may get more bandwidth than others, 
and potentially they may have to pay a higher price for more bandwidth.

Guaranteed Service Levels and Lower Error Rates
In today’s Internet, there is no service-level guarantee and no way to purchase the 
right to move data through the Internet at a fixed pace. Today’s Internet promises only 
“best effort.” The Internet is democratic—it speeds or slows everyone’s traffic alike. In 
the future, it might be possible to purchase the right to move data through the network 
at a guaranteed speed in return for higher fees.
Declining Costs
As the Internet pipeline is upgraded, the availability of broadband service will expand 
beyond major metropolitan areas, significantly reducing the cost of access. More users 
mean lower cost, as products and technology catch on in the mass market. Higher 
volume usage enables providers to lower the cost of both access devices, or clients, and 
the service required to use such products. Both broadband and wireless service fees 
are expected to decline as geographic service areas increase, in part due to competition 
for that business.
The Internet of Things
No discussion of the future Internet would be complete without mentioning the 
Internet of Things (IoT), also sometimes referred to as the Industrial Internet. 
Internet technology is spreading beyond the desktop, laptop, and tablet computer, and 
beyond the smartphone, to consumer electronics, electrical appliances, cars, medical 
devices, utility systems, machines of all types, even clothing—just about anything that 
can be equipped with sensors that can collect data and connect to the Internet, 
enabling the data to be analyzed with data analytics software.
IoT builds on a foundation of existing technologies, such as radio frequency iden-
tification (RFID) tags, and is being enabled by the availability of low-cost sensors, the 
drop in price of data storage, the development of “big data” analytics software that 
can work with trillions of pieces of data, as well as implementation of IPv6, which 
will allow Internet addresses to be assigned to all of these new devices. Although IoT 
devices don’t necessarily have to be wireless, most use wireless communications 
technology previously discussed, such as cellular networks, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other 
wireless protocols such as ZigBee or Z-Wave, to connect either directly or via a mobile 
app to the Internet (often a cloud service).
IoT technology is powering the development of “smart” connected “things”— tele-
visions, houses, and cars, as well as wearable technology—clothing and devices like the 
Apple Watch, profiled in the opening case. Smart televisions that integrate directly with 
the Internet and can run apps have become very popular, with more than half (52%) 
of all U.S. Internet homes having at least one TV connected to the Internet (NPD 
Group Inc, 2016). Smart houses have attracted even more interest, fueled by Google’s 
purchase of Nest Labs for $3.2 billion in 2014. Nest Labs makes smart thermostats, 
home security cameras, and smoke and carbon monoxide alarms. In 2015, Nest Labs 
announced that it was making Nest Weave, a protocol it had developed that enables 
appliances, thermostats, door locks, and other devices to communicate with each other 
and other Nest products, available to third-party developers and manufacturers. Apple

announced a smart home platform that it calls HomeKit in 2014. HomeKit is a frame-
work and network protocol for controlling devices in the home that is programmed 
directly into Apple’s iOS software for iPhones and iPads, and is integrated with Siri, 
Apple’s voice-activated artificial intelligence assistant. By 2016, a number of devices 
had been designed specifically for use with HomeKit, such as a smart thermostat, 
a smart deadbolt lock, a home sensor that provides temperature, humidity, and air 
quality readings, and an iDevices switch that enables you to turn electronic devices 
on and off using Siri. Many cable companies such as Time Warner Cable, Comcast, 
and AT&T already offer connected home systems that include appliances and lights. 
All in all, the global market for smart house products is expected to grow from about 
$47 billion in 2015 to over $120 billion by 2022 (Research and Markets, 2016). 
In September 2014, as discussed in the chapter-opening case, Apple introduced the 
Apple Watch. The Apple Watch features a fitness/activity tracker similar to offerings 
from Fitbit, Nike+, FuelBand, and Jawbone Up, is able to access a wide variety of apps, 
and also works with Apple Pay, Apple’s mobile payment service. A number of other 
manufacturers, such as Samsung, LG, Motorola, and Swatch, have also introduced 
smartwatches. Wearable computing is expected to grow into a $170 billion business 
by 2021.
Connected cars that have built-in Internet access have also arrived (see the Insight 
on Technology case, Are Connected Cars the Next Hot Entertainment Vehicle? in Chapter 
2). Here too, Google and Apple are major players. In 2014, Google announced the 
Open Automotive Alliance, a group of leading automakers and technology companies 
focused on bringing the Android platform to cars. Shortly thereafter, Apple announced 
CarPlay, a software platform that synchronizes iPhones to the car’s infotainment 
system. Android Auto and CarPlay-enabled vehicles began to be introduced in 2015, 
and have become more widely available in 2016. Connected cars are likely to be inte-
grated with smart home initiatives in the future. Already, iControl, which provides the 
software underlying automated home systems from Comcast, TimeWarner, ADT, and 
others, has entered into a partnership with Zubie, a provider of connected car services. 
The next frontier on the connected car front is the the self-driving car, combining IoT 
and artificial intelligence technologies. Many Internet technology companies, ranging 
from giants such as Google, Baidu (China’s version of Google), Uber, and Intel to 
start-ups like Drive.ai and Mobileye, have jumped into the fray alongside automotive 
companies such as Tesla, BMW, Volvo, GM, Ford, and others, with the goal of offering 
self-driving, autonomous cars by 2019 or sooner.
Despite all of the IoT activity, however, interoperability remains a major concern. 
As with many technologies in the early stages of development, many organizations are 
fighting to create the standards that participants in the market will follow. The AllSeen 
Alliance, formed by Qualcomm in 2013 with 50 other companies, including Microsoft 
and Cisco, is one group that hopes to create an open source standard. Membership in 
the Alliance has soared since its initial founding and in 2016, it has over 200 members. 
Another group, the Open Connectivity Foundation (formerly the Open Interconnect 
Consortium), formed in 2014 by Intel, Broadcom, Dell, and others apparently not 
happy with the AllSeen effort, has also seen its membership soar to over 200 members. 
A different group, the Industrial Internet Consortium, has been formed by AT&T,

Cisco, GE, IBM, and Intel to focus on engineering standards for industrial assets. The 
Wolfram Connected Devices Project is aimed at developing a database of IoT devices, 
and currently includes more than 3,000. And as with many other types of Internet-
related technology, Google with its Android operating system and Apple with AirPlay 
wireless streaming protocol may be trying to create their own standards.
Other concerns include security and privacy. Security experts believe that IoT 
devices could potentially be a security disaster, with the potential for malware being 
spread through a connected network, and difficulty in issuing patches to devices, 
leaving them vulnerable (Internet Society, 2015). Data from stand-alone smart devices 
can reveal much personal detail about a consumer’s life, and if those devices are all 
ultimately interconnected, there will be little that is truly private.
Although challenges remain before the Internet of Things is fully realized, it 
is coming closer and closer to fruition. As of 2016, experts estimate that there are 
anywhere from 6.4 billion to 9 billion IoT devices (not including smartphones, tablets, 
or desktop computers), with some projecting as many as 100 billion connected IoT 
devices and global economic impact of more than $11 trillion by 2025 (Nordstrom, 
2016; Internet Society, 2015).

THE WEB
Without the Web, there would be no e-commerce. The invention of the Web brought 
an extraordinary expansion of digital services to millions of amateur computer users, 
including color text and pages, formatted text, pictures, animations, video, and sound. 
In short, the Web makes nearly all the rich elements of human expression needed 
to establish a commercial marketplace available to nontechnical computer users 
worldwide.
While the Internet was born in the 1960s, the Web was not invented until 1989–
1991 by Dr. Tim Berners-Lee of the European Particle Physics Laboratory, better 
known as CERN (Berners-Lee et al., 1994). Several earlier authors—such as Vannevar 
Bush (in 1945) and Ted Nelson (in the 1960s)—had suggested the possibility of organiz-
ing knowledge as a set of interconnected pages that users could freely browse (Bush, 
1945; Ziff Davis Publishing, 1998). Berners-Lee and his associates at CERN built on 
these ideas and developed the initial versions of HTML, HTTP, a web server, and a 
browser, the four essential components of the Web.
First, Berners-Lee wrote a computer program that allowed formatted pages within 
his own computer to be linked using keywords (hyperlinks). Clicking on a keyword in 
a document would immediately move him to another document. Berners-Lee created 
the pages using a modified version of a powerful text markup language called Standard 
Generalized Markup Language (SGML).
Berners-Lee called this language HyperText Markup Language, or HTML. He 
then came up with the idea of storing his HTML pages on the Internet. Remote client 
computers could access these pages by using HTTP (introduced earlier in Section 3.1 
and described more fully in the next section). But these early web pages still appeared 

	
T h e  W e b 	

155
as black and white text pages with hyperlinks expressed inside brackets. The early 
Web was based on text only; the original web browser only provided a line interface.
Information shared on the Web remained text-based until 1993, when Marc 
Andreessen and others at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) 
at the University of Illinois created a web browser with a graphical user interface (GUI) 
called Mosaic that made it possible to view documents on the Web graphically—using 
colored backgrounds, images, and even primitive animations. Mosaic was a software 
program that could run on any graphically based interface such as Macintosh, 
Windows, or Unix. The Mosaic browser software read the HTML text on a web page 
and displayed it as a graphical interface document within a GUI operating system such 
as Windows or Macintosh. Liberated from simple black and white text pages, HTML 
pages could now be viewed by anyone in the world who could operate a mouse and 
use a Macintosh or PC.
Aside from making the content of web pages colorful and available to the world’s 
population, the graphical web browser created the possibility of universal computing, 
the sharing of files, information, graphics, sound, video, and other objects across all 
computer platforms in the world, regardless of operating system. A browser could be 
made for each of the major operating systems, and the web pages created for one 
system, say, Windows, would also be displayed exactly the same, or nearly the same, 
on computers running the Macintosh or Unix operating systems. As long as each 
operating system had a Mosaic browser, the same web pages could be used on all the 
different types of computers and operating systems. This meant that no matter what 
kind of computer you used, anywhere in the world, you would see the same web 
pages. The browser and the Web have introduced us to a whole new world of comput-
ing and information management that was unthinkable prior to 1993.
In 1994, Andreessen and Jim Clark founded Netscape, which created the first 
commercial browser, Netscape Navigator. Although Mosaic had been distributed 
free of charge, Netscape initially charged for its software. In August 1995, Microsoft 
Corporation released its own free version of a browser, called Internet Explorer. 
In the ensuing years, Netscape fell from a 100% market share to less than .5% in 
2009. The fate of Netscape illustrates an important e-commerce business lesson. 
Innovators usually are not long-term winners, whereas smart followers often have 
the assets needed for long-term survival. Much of the Netscape browser code sur-
vives today in the Firefox browser produced by Mozilla, a nonprofit heavily funded 
by Google.
HYPERTEXT
Web pages can be accessed through the Internet because the web browser software on 
your PC can request web pages stored on an Internet host server using the HTTP 
protocol. Hypertext is a way of formatting pages with embedded links that connect 
documents to one another and that also link pages to other objects such as sound, 
video, or animation files. When you click on a graphic and a video clip plays, you have 
clicked on a hyperlink. For example, when you type a web address in your browser 
such as http://www.sec.gov, your browser sends an HTTP request to the sec.gov server 
requesting the home page of sec.gov.

HTTP is the first set of letters at the start of every web address, followed by the 
domain name. The domain name specifies the organization’s server computer that 
is housing the document. Most companies have a domain name that is the same as 
or closely related to their official corporate name. The directory path and document 
name are two more pieces of information within the web address that help the browser 
track down the requested page. Together, the address is called a Uniform Resource 
Locator, or URL. When typed into a browser, a URL tells it exactly where to look for 
the information. For example, in the following URL:
http://www.megacorp.com/content/features/082602.html
http = the protocol used to display web pages
www.megacorp.com = domain name
content/features = the directory path that identifies where on the domain web 
server the page is stored
082602.html = the document name and its format (an HTML page)
The most common domain extensions (known as general top-level domains, or 
gTLDs) currently available and officially sanctioned by ICANN are shown in Table 
3.14. Countries also have domain names, such as .uk, .au, and .fr (United Kingdom, 
Australia, and France, respectively). These are sometimes referred to as country-
code top-level domains, or ccTLDs. In 2008, ICANN approved a significant expansion 
of gTLDs, with potential new domains representing cities (such as .berlin), regions 
(.africa), ethnicity (.eus), industry/activities (such as .health), and even brands (such 
as .deloitte). In 2009, ICANN began the process of implementing these guidelines. 
In 2011, ICANN removed nearly all restrictions on domain names, thereby greatly 
expanding the number of different domain names available. As of August 2016, over 
1,150 gTLDs have been applied for, acquired, and launched. The new gTLDs are in 
multiple languages and scripts/characters (including Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and 
Russian) and include geographic place names such as .nyc, .london, and .paris; busi-
ness identifiers such as .restaurant, .realtor, .technology, and .lawyer; brand names 
such as .bmw and .suzuki; and a whole host of other descriptive names.
MARKUP LANGUAGES
Although the most common web page formatting language is HTML, the concept 
behind document formatting actually had its roots in the 1960s with the development 
of Generalized Markup Language (GML).
HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a GML that is relatively easy to use. HTML 
provides web page designers with a fixed set of markup “tags” that are used to format 
a web page (see Figure 3.15). When these tags are inserted into a web page, they are 
read by the browser and interpreted into a page display. You can see the source HTML

code for any web page by simply clicking on the “Page Source” command found in all 
browsers. In Figure 3.15, the HTML code in the first screen produces the display in 
the second screen.
HTML defines the structure and style of a document, including the headings, 
graphic positioning, tables, and text formatting. Since its introduction, the major brows-
ers have continuously added features to HTML to enable programmers to further 
refine their page layouts. Unfortunately, some browser enhancements may work only 
in one company’s browser. Whenever you build an e-commerce site, you should take 
care that the pages can be viewed by the major browsers, even outdated versions of 
browsers. HTML web pages can be created with any text editor, such as Notepad or 
WordPad, using Microsoft Word (simply save the Word document as a web page), or 
any one of several web page development tools such as Microsoft Expression Web or 
Adobe Dreamweaver CC.5
The most recent version of HTML is HTML5. HTML5 introduces features like 
video playback and drag-and-drop that in the past were provided by plug-ins like Adobe 
Flash. HTML5 is also used in the development of mobile websites and mobile apps, 
and is an important tool in both responsive web design and adaptive web delivery, all 
of which are discussed more fully in Chapter 4. The Insight on Technology case, The 
Rise of HTML5, examines the increasing use of HTML5.

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
THE RISE OF HTML5
In 2010, Apple founder Steve Jobs 
lambasted Adobe Flash for its poor 
security, poor performance on mobile 
devices, and for being an energy hog. 
Jobs instead trumpeted HTML5 as the 
preferred method for displaying video online. 
Fast forward to 2016. Two years after its official 
ratification by the W3C, the Web’s standards-
setting organization, HTML5 has become a de 
facto standard, proving once again Jobs’ uncanny 
ability to see and perhaps shape the future.
HTML5 has become a catch-all term that 
encompasses not only the video element but also 
the use of the newest versions of Cascading Style 
Sheets (CSS3) and Java­Script, and another new 
tool, HTML5 Canvas, that is used with a set of 
JavaScript functions to render simple animations, 
which reduces page load time. HTML5 provides 
not only device independence, but can also access 
the  built-in functionality of mobile devices, such 
as GPS and swiping, enabling the creation of web-
based mobile apps that can replicate the native 
app experience. Web-based mobile apps (HTML5 
apps) work just like web pages, with page content, 
including graphics, images, and video, loaded into 
the browser from a web server, rather than residing 
in the mobile device hardware like a native app. 
This concept has been embraced by mobile develop-
ers who naturally dream of being able to reach all 
platforms with a single product.
For businesses, the cost savings of HTML5 
are obvious. A single HTML5 app requires far less 
effort to build than multiple native apps for the 
iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and other platforms. 
HTML5 apps can more easily be linked to and 
shared on social networks, encouraging viral dis-
tribution. Some HTML5 apps can even be designed 
so that they can be run on mobile devices when they 
are offline. Differences in how apps run across dif-
ferent platforms and workarounds are eliminated. 
In the past, HTML5 apps couldn’t approach the 
smooth and speedy user experience of a native app, 
but thanks to advancements in the underlying tech-
nologies behind HTML5 and improvements in the 
expertise of HTML5 developers, that is no longer 
the case. Flash also requires installation, whereas 
HTML5 does not.
In 2014, the Interactive Advertising Bureau 
(IAB), together with a number of the largest online 
publishers and advertising firms, urged advertisers 
to implement HTML5 as the standard for mobile 
ads in order to guarantee that ads will run and look 
good on different platforms, and in 2015 released 
guidelines that fully embrace HTML5, citing 
interoperability and the improved effectiveness of 
HTML5 ads. The rise of HTML5 has mirrored the 
growth of the mobile platform as it supplants Flash, 
which was developed for the desktop, as the pre-
ferred media delivery platform on the Web. During 
this time, Flash has continued to struggle with criti-
cal security vulnerabilities. In response, the online 
advertising industry has responded by reducing or 
eliminating the use of Flash. For instance, in 2016, 
Facebook mandated HTML5 instead of Flash for 
all videos posted to its site, reporting improved 
loading times, fewer bugs, and better engagement, 
and Google signaled a shift towards HTML5 by 
blocking Flash advertisements from autoplaying 
in Chrome, in part due to their notorious security 
issues. In 2016, Chrome began to automatically 
block any non-visible Flash content, like tracking 
cookies, and by year’s end, HTML5 will be the 
“default” for Chrome, except where sites only sup-
port Flash. Google also announced that its display 
ads would be 100 percent HTML5 by the beginning 
of 2017. Mozilla Firefox made a similar announce-
ment shortly thereafter regarding non-visible Flash 
content and its own plans to make HTML5 its 
default by 2017, meaning that over 80% of the 
web browser market is now blocking Flash. Apple’s

C H A P T E R  3     E - c o m m e r c e  I n f r a s t r u c t u r e :  T h e  I n t e r n e t ,  W e b ,  a n d  M o b i l e  P l a t f o r m
Safari browser, one of the first to impose 
restrictions on Flash, has taken steps to pre-
vent sites offering both Flash and HTML5 from 
displaying Flash content. Twitch, one of the largest 
sites still using Flash video streaming, announced 
it would begin a switch to HTML5 in 2016, just as 
YouTube did a year earlier. The moves from these 
advertising and tech juggernauts have solidified the 
downfall of Flash and the rise of HTML5 as the 
future of advertising. Even Adobe itself has begun 
to recommend that content creators use HTML5 
instead of Flash and has renamed its Flash Profes-
sional tool to ‘Adobe Animate CC,’ adding HTML5 
support and the ability to convert Flash advertise-
ments to HTML5.
Retailers have taken notice. One example of 
a company using HTML5 with success is Rakuten 
Shopping, an online retailer that offers a wide vari-
ety of goods online, and is currently ranked as one 
of Internet Retailer’s top 30 mobile retailers. Using 
HTML5 has enabled Rakuten to shift away from 
using cookies to store customer attributes and has 
lightened the load on its servers.
Another example is the Financial Times, whose 
HTML5 app has proven to be an important driver 
for FT’s business. FT first switched from a native 
app to HTML5 in 2011, in part to make maintain-
ing the app across multiple platforms and devices 
easier. In 2013, FT rolled out a redesign of the 
app, featuring even more videos and personaliza-
tion features.
In fact, according to Indeed, which searches 
millions of jobs from thousands of different job 
sites, “HTML5” continues to be one of the fast-
est growing keywords found in online job postings. 
Many online advertisers that have relied heavily on 
Flash are also struggling to adapt to the emergence 
of HTML5 ads, which are larger in size and require 
testing on more platforms. Content creators and 
advertisers alike are also uneager to manage two 
different formats. In the past, they only had to deal 
with Flash, and many have been unwilling to make 
the transition just yet.
However, even given all its benefits, HTML5 
is not without flaws. For instance, HTML5 has not 
consistently supported digital rights management 
(DRM). In the past, media companies developed 
their own copy protection standards based on 
geographical region and/or whether payment 
had been proffered. These were enforced through 
their own media players. Because HTML5 does 
not require plug-ins to play video (or audio), 
and further, because HTML5 is an official W3C 
standard charged with remaining vendor neutral, 
this presents a challenge to HTML5 developers. 
HTML5 also allows websites to track how much 
battery power their site visitors have remaining. 
This feature was implemented so that sites could 
warn users to recharge their battery, but the 
reporting is so detailed that sites can determine 
what sites you’ve come from last solely based on 
your battery information, presenting privacy con-
cerns. However, the security issues with HTML5 
pale in comparison to those associated with Flash, 
and it’s still early in the development cycle for 
HTML5.

eXtensible Markup Language (XML)
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) takes web document formatting a giant leap 
forward. XML is a markup language specification developed by the W3C that is similar 
to HTML, but has a very different purpose. Whereas the purpose of HTML is to control 
the “look and feel” and display of data on the web page, XML is designed to describe 
data and information. For example, consider the sample XML document in Figure 
3.16. The first line in the sample document is the XML declaration, which is always 
included; it defines the XML version of the document. In this case, the document 
conforms to the 1.0 specification of XML. The next line defines the first element of 
the document (the root element): <note>. The next four lines define four child ele-
ments of the root (to, from, heading, and body). The last line defines the end of the 
root element. Notice that XML says nothing about how to display the data, or how the 
text should look on the screen. HTML is used for information display in combination 
with XML, which is used for data description.
Figure 3.17 shows how XML can be used to define a database of company names 
in a company directory. Tags such as <Company>, <Name>, and <Specialty> can 
be defined for a single firm, or an entire industry. On an elementary level, XML is 
extraordinarily easy to learn and is very similar to HTML except that you can make 
up your own tags. At a deeper level, XML has a rich syntax and an enormous set of 
software tools, which make XML ideal for storing and communicating many types of 
data on the Web.
XML is “extensible,” which means the tags used to describe and display data are 
defined by the user, whereas in HTML the tags are limited and predefined. XML can 
also transform information into new formats, such as by importing information from 
a database and displaying it as a table. With XML, information can be analyzed and 
displayed selectively, making it a more powerful alternative to HTML. This means 
that business firms, or entire industries, can describe all of their invoices, accounts 
payable, payroll records, and financial information using a web-compatible markup 
language. Once described, these business documents can be stored on intranet web 
servers and shared throughout the corporation.

sent to their computers over the Internet. An RSS aggregator software application that 
you install on your computer gathers material from the websites and blogs that you 
tell it to scan and brings new information from those sites to you. Sometimes this is 
referred to as “syndicated” content because it is distributed by news organizations and 
other syndicators (or distributors). Users download an RSS aggregator and then “sub-
scribe” to the RSS “feeds.” When you go to your RSS aggregator’s page, it will display 
the most recent updates for each channel to which you have subscribed. RSS has 
rocketed from a “techie” pastime to a broad-based movement. Although Google has 
closed down Google Reader, a popular RSS product, a number of other RSS reader 
options remain, including Feedly, Reeder, and NewsBlur.
WEB SERVERS AND CLIENTS
We have already described client/server computing and the revolution in computing 
architecture brought about by client/server computing. You already know that a server 
is a computer attached to a network that stores files, controls peripheral devices, 
interfaces with the outside world—including the Internet—and does some processing 
for other computers on the network.
But what is a web server? Web server software refers to the software that enables 
a computer to deliver web pages written in HTML to client computers on a network 
that request this service by sending an HTTP request. Apache, which works with Linux 
and Unix operating systems, is the most commonly used type of web server software. 
Microsoft’s Internet Information Services (IIS) also has significant market share (Net-
craft, 2016).

Aside from responding to requests for web pages, all web servers provide some 
additional basic capabilities such as the following:
•	 Security services—These consist mainly of authentication services that verify that 
the person trying to access the site is authorized to do so. For websites that process 
payment transactions, the web server also supports SSL and TLS, the protocols for 
transmitting and receiving information securely over the Internet. When private 
information such as names, phone numbers, addresses, and credit card data needs 
to be provided to a website, the web server uses SSL to ensure that the data passing 
back and forth from the browser to the server is not compromised.
•	 FTP—This protocol allows users to transfer files to and from the server. Some sites 
limit file uploads to the web server, while others restrict downloads, depending on 
the user’s identity.
•	 Search engine—Just as search engine sites enable users to search the entire Web 
for particular documents, search engine modules within the basic web server soft-
ware package enable indexing of the site’s web pages and content and permit easy 
keyword searching of the site’s content. When conducting a search, a search engine 
makes use of an index, which is a list of all the documents on the server. The search 
term is compared to the index to identify likely matches.
•	 Data capture—Web servers are also helpful at monitoring site traffic, capturing 
information on who has visited a site, how long the user stayed there, the date 
and time of each visit, and which specific pages on the server were accessed. This 
information is compiled and saved in a log file, which can then be analyzed. By 
analyzing a log file, a site manager can find out the total number of visitors, the 
average length of each visit, and the most popular destinations, or web pages.
The term web server is also used to refer to the physical computer that runs web 
server software. Leading manufacturers of web server computers include Lenovo, 
Dell, and Hewlett-Packard. Although any desktop computer can run web server 
software, it is best to use a computer that has been optimized for this purpose. To 
be a web server, a computer must have the web server software installed and be 
connected to the Internet. Every public web server computer has an IP address. For 
example, if you type http://www.pearsonhighered.com/laudon in your browser, the 
browser software sends a request for HTTP service to the web server whose domain 
name is pearsonhighered.com. The server then locates the page named “laudon” on 
its hard drive, sends the page back to your browser, and displays it on your screen. 
Of course, firms also can use web servers for strictly internal local area networking 
in intranets.
Aside from the generic web server software packages, there are actually many 
types of specialized servers on the Web, from database servers that access specific 
information within a database, to ad servers that deliver targeted banner ads, to mail 
servers that provide e-mail messages, and video servers that provide video clips. At 
a small e-commerce site, all of these software packages might be running on a single 
computer, with a single processor. At a large corporate site, there may be hundreds or 
thousands of discrete server computers, many with multiple processors, running 
specialized web server functions. We discuss the architecture of e-commerce sites in 
greater detail in Chapter 4.

A web client, on the other hand, is any computing device attached to the Internet 
that is capable of making HTTP requests and displaying HTML pages. The most 
common client is a Windows or Macintosh desktop computer, with various flavors of 
Unix/Linux computers a distant third. However, the fastest growing category of web 
clients is not computers at all, but mobile devices. In general, a web client can be any 
device—including a printer, refrigerator, stove, home lighting system, or automobile 
instrument panel—capable of sending and receiving information from a web server.
WEB BROWSERS
A web browser is a software program whose primary purpose is to display web pages. 
Browsers also have added features, such as e-mail and newsgroups (an online discus-
sion group or forum). As of July 2016, the leading desktop web browser is Google’s 
Chrome, a small, yet technologically advanced open source browser, with about 51% 
of the market. Chrome is also the leading mobile/tablet browser, with about a 52% 
share of that market. The second most popular desktop browser is Microsoft’s Internet 
Explorer, with about a 30% share. However, Internet Explorer’s share of the mobile/
tablet market is miniscule, with less than a 2% share.  Mozilla Firefox is in third place 
in the desktop browser marketplace, with only about 8% share. It has less than a 1% 
share of the mobile/tablet browser market. First released in 2004, Firefox is a free, 
open source web browser for the Windows, Linux, and Macintosh operating systems, 
based on Mozilla open source code (which originally provided the code for Netscape). 
It is small and fast and offers many features such as pop-up blocking and tabbed 
browsing. Apple’s Safari browser has only about a 4.5% share of the desktop browser 
market, but is the second most popular mobile/tablet browser, with a 28% share, due 
in large part to its use on iPhones and iPads  (Marketshare.hitslink.com, 2016a, 2016b). 
In 2015, Microsoft introduced Edge, an entirely new browser bundled with its new 
operating system, Windows 10. Edge was designed to replace Internet Explorer. 
However, despite the popularity of Windows 10, Edge has thus far been largely ignored 
by Windows 10 adopters and has been installed on only about 5% of desktops.

THE INTERNET AND THE WEB: FEATURES AND 
SERVICES
The Internet and the Web have spawned a number of powerful software applications 
upon which the foundations of e-commerce are built. You can think of all these as 
web services, and it is interesting as you read along to compare these services to other 
traditional media such as television or print media. If you do, you will quickly realize 
the richness of the Internet environment.
COMMUNICATION TOOLS
The Internet and Web provide a number of communication tools that enable people 
around the globe to communicate with one another, both on a one-to-one basis as well

as a one-to-many basis. Communication tools include e-mail, messaging applications, 
online message boards (forums), Internet telephony applications, and video conferenc-
ing, video chatting, and telepresence. We’ll look at each of these in a bit more depth 
in the following sections.  
E-mail
Since its earliest days, electronic mail, or e-mail, has been the most-used application 
of the Internet. Worldwide, there are over 2.6 billion e-mail users, sending over 2.15 
billion e-mails a day. There are an estimated 1.7 billion mobile e-mail users worldwide, 
with over 65% of all e-mail users worldwide accessing e-mail on a mobile device 
(Radicati Group, 2016). Estimates vary on the amount of spam, ranging from 40% to 
90%. E-mail marketing and spam are examined in more depth in Chapter 6.
E-mail uses a series of protocols to enable messages containing text, images, 
sound, and video clips to be transferred from one Internet user to another. Because 
of its flexibility and speed, it is now the most popular form of business communica-
tion—more popular than the phone, fax, or snail mail (the U.S. Postal Service). In 
addition to text typed within the message, e-mail also allows attachments, which are 
files inserted within the e-mail message. The files can be documents, images, sounds, 
or video clips.
Messaging Applications
Instant messaging (IM) allows you to send messages in real time,unlike e-mail, 
which has a time lag of several seconds to minutes between when messages are sent 
and received. IM displays text entered almost instantaneously. Recipients can then 
respond immediately to the sender the same way, making the communication more 
like a live conversation than is possible through e-mail. To use IM, users create a buddy 
list they want to communicate with, and then enter short text messages that their 
buddies will receive instantly (if they are online at the time). And although text 
remains the primary communication mechanism in IM, more advanced systems also 
provide voice and video chat functionality. Instant messaging over the Internet com-
petes with cell phone Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Messaging Service 
(MMS) texting, which is far more expensive than IM. Major IM systems include Skype, 
Yahoo Messenger, Google Hangouts, and AIM (AOL Instant Messenger). IM systems 
were initially developed as proprietary systems, with competing firms offering versions 
that did not work with one another. Today, there still is no built-in interoperability 
among the major IM systems.
Mobile messaging apps, such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp (purchased by 
Facebook for $22 billion in 2014), Snapchat (which allows users to send pictures, 
videos, and texts that will disappear after a short period of time), Kik, Viber, and others 
have also become wildly popular, providing competition for both traditional desktop 
IM systems and SMS text messaging. In the United States in 2016, over 130 million 
people (about 40% of the population) use mobile messaging apps, and companies 
are increasingly turning their attention to using these apps to market their brands 
(eMarketer, Inc., 2016g).

Online Message Boards
An online message board (also referred to as a forum, bulletin board, discussion 
board, discussion group, or simply a board or forum) is a web application that enables 
Internet users to communicate with each other, although not in real time. A message 
board provides a container for various discussions (or “threads”) started (or “posted”) 
by members of the board, and depending on the permissions granted to board 
members by the board’s administrator, enables a person to start a thread and reply to 
other people’s threads. Most message board software allows more than one message 
board to be created. The board administrator typically can edit, delete, move, or oth-
erwise modify any thread on the board. Unlike an electronic mailing list (such as a 
listserv), which automatically sends new messages to a subscriber, an online message 
board typically requires that the member visit the board to check for new posts. Some 
boards offer an “e-mail notification” feature that notifies users that a new post of inter-
est to them has been made.
Internet Telephony
If the telephone system were to be built from scratch today, it would be an Internet-
based, packet-switched network using TCP/IP because it would be less expensive and 
more efficient than the alternative existing system, which involves a mix of circuit-
switched legs with a digital backbone. In fact, AT&T has begun testing all-digital IP 
phone networks in several U.S. cities. Likewise, if cable television systems were built 
from scratch today, they most likely would use Internet technologies for the same 
reasons.
IP telephony is a general term for the technologies that use Voice over Internet 
Protocol (VoIP) and the Internet’s packet-switched network to transmit voice, fax, 
and other forms of audio communication over the Internet. VoIP can be used over a 
traditional handset as well as over a mobile device. VoIP avoids the long distance 
charges imposed by traditional phone companies.
There were about 230 million residential VoIP subscribers worldwide in 2015, and 
in the United States, more than half of residential customers are now using VoIP, and 
this number is expanding rapidly as cable systems provide telephone service as part of 
their “triple play”: voice, Internet, and TV as a single package. This number is dwarfed, 
however, by the number of mobile VoIP subscribers, which has grown explosively over 
the last several years, fueled by the rampant growth of mobile messaging apps that 
now also provide free VoIP services, such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp (also 
owned by Facebook), Viber (owned by Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten), WeChat, 
Line, KakaoTalk, and others (IHS, 2016; BuddeComm, 2016).
VoIP is a disruptive technology. In the past, voice and fax were the exclusive 
provenance of the regulated telephone networks. With the convergence of the Internet 
and telephony, however, this dominance is already starting to change, with local and 
long distance telephone providers and cable companies becoming ISPs, and ISPs 
getting into the phone market. Key players in the VoiP market include independent 
service providers such as VoIP pioneers Vonage and Skype (now owned by Microsoft), 
as well as traditional players such as telephone and cable companies that have moved 
aggressively into the market. Skype currently dominates the international market.

Skype carries over 3 billion minutes per day (translating into about 90 billion minutes 
per month) from 300 million users around the world (Anurag, 2016). 
Video Conferencing, Video Chatting, and Telepresence
Internet video conferencing is accessible to anyone with a broadband Internet con-
nection and a web camera (webcam). The most widely used web conferencing suite 
of tools is WebEx (now owned by Cisco). VoIP companies such as Skype and ooVoo 
also provide more limited web conferencing capabilities, commonly referred to as 
video chatting. Apple’s FaceTime is another video chatting technology available for 
iOS mobile devices with a forward-facing camera and Macintosh computers equipped 
with Apple’s version of a webcam, called a FaceTime camera.
Telepresence takes video conferencing up several notches. Rather than single 
persons “meeting” by using webcams, telepresence creates an environment in a room 
using multiple cameras and screens, which surround the users. The experience is 
uncanny and strange at first because as you look at the people in the screens, they are 
looking directly at you. Broadcast quality and higher screen resolutions help create the 
effect. Users have the sensation of “being in the presence of their colleagues” in a way 
that is not true for traditional webcam meetings. Providers of telepresence software 
and hardware include Cisco, LifeSize, BlueJeans Network, and Polycom ATX. 
SEARCH ENGINES
Search engines identify web pages that appear to match keywords, also called queries, 
entered by a user and then provide a list of the best matches (search results). Almost 
85% of U.S. Internet users regularly use search engines from either desktop or mobile 
devices, and they generate around 16 billion queries a month on desktop computers, 
about 10.2 billion of which are conducted using Google. Desktop search volume is 
declining, as more and more search activity moves to mobile devices. In fact, Google 
has reported that mobile search queries exceeded desktop queries in the United States 
and numerous other countries for the first time in 2015 (eMarketer, Inc., 2016h, 2016i; 
Sterling, 2016). There are hundreds of different search engines, but the vast majority 
of the search results are supplied by the top three providers: Google, Microsoft’s Bing, 
and Yahoo. Google currently has about 64% of the desktop search market based on 
number of searches, followed by Microsoft’s Bing, with about 22%, and Yahoo with 
about 12%.
Web search engines started out in the early 1990s shortly after Netscape released 
the first commercial web browser. Early search engines were relatively simple software 
programs that roamed the nascent Web, visiting pages and gathering information about 
the content of each web page. These early programs were called variously crawlers, 
spiders, and wanderers; the first full-text crawler that indexed the contents of an entire 
web page was called WebCrawler, released in 1994. AltaVista (1995), one of the first 
widely used search engines, was the first to allow “natural language” queries such as 
“history of web search engines” rather than “history + web + search engine.”
The first search engines employed simple keyword indexes of all the web pages 
visited. They would count the number of times a word appeared on the web page, and 
store this information in an index. These search engines could be easily fooled by web

designers who simply repeated words on their home pages. The real innovations in 
search engine development occurred through a program funded by the Department 
of Defense called the Digital Library Initiative, designed to help the Pentagon find 
research papers in large databases. Stanford, Berkeley, and three other universities 
became hotbeds of web search innovations in the mid-1990s. At Stanford in 1994, two 
computer science students, David Filo and Jerry Yang, created a hand-selected list 
of their favorite web pages and called it “Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle,” 
or Yahoo!. Yahoo initially was not a real search engine, but rather an edited selection 
of web sites organized by categories the editors found useful. Yahoo later developed 
“true” search engine capabilities.
In 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two Stanford computer science students, 
released their first version of the Google search engine. This search engine was dif-
ferent: not only did it index each web page’s words, but Page had discovered that the 
AltaVista search engine not only collected keywords from sites but also calculated what 
other sites linked to each page. By looking at the URLs on each web page, they could 
calculate an index of popularity. AltaVista did nothing with this information. Page 
took this idea and made it a central factor in ranking a web page’s appropriateness to a 
search query. He patented the idea of a web page ranking system (PageRank System), 
which essentially measures the popularity of the web page. Brin contributed a unique 
web crawler program that indexed not just keywords on a web page, but combina-
tions of words (such as authors and their article titles). These two ideas became the 
foundation for the Google search engine (Brandt, 2004). Figure 3.18(A) illustrates 
how Google indexes the Web. Figure 3.18(B) shows you what happens when you 
enter a search query.
Initially, few understood how to make money from search engines. That changed 
in 2000 when Goto.com (later Overture) allowed advertisers to bid for placement 
on their search engine results, and Google followed suit in 2003 with its AdWords 
program, which allowed advertisers to bid for placement of short text ads on Google 
search results. The spectacular increase in Internet advertising revenues (which have 
been growing at around 20%–25% annually over the last few years) has helped search 
engines transform themselves into major shopping tools and created an entire new 
industry called “search engine marketing.”
When users enter a search term at Google, Bing, Yahoo, or any of the other web-
sites serviced by these search engines, they receive two types of listings: sponsored 
links, for which advertisers have paid to be listed (usually at the top of the search 
results page), and unsponsored “organic” search results. Advertisers can also purchase 
small text ads on the right side of the search results page. In addition, search engines 
have extended their services to include news, maps, satellite images, computer images, 
e-mail, group calendars, group meeting tools, and indexes of scholarly papers.
Although the major search engines are used for locating general information of 
interest to users, search engines have also become a crucial tool within e-commerce 
sites. Customers can more easily search for the product information they want with the 
help of an internal search program; the difference is that within websites, the search 
engine is limited to finding matches from that one site. For instance, more online 
shoppers use Amazon’s internal search engine to look for products than conducting a

product search using Google, a fact noted by Google’s executive chairman Eric Schmidt, 
who believes that Amazon search poses a significant threat to Google (Mangalindan, 
2014). Pinterest hopes to challenge Google in the realm of visual search, as discussed 
in the closing case study in Chapter 1.
DOWNLOADABLE AND STREAMING MEDIA 
When you download a file from the Web, the file is transferred from a web server and 
is stored on your computer for later use. With the low-bandwidth connections of the 
early Internet, audio and video files were difficult to download, but with the huge 
growth in broadband connections, these files are not only commonplace but today 
constitute the majority of web traffic. Streaming media is an alternative to down-
loaded media and enables video, music, and other large-bandwidth files to be sent to 
a user in a variety of ways that enable the user to play the files as they are being 
delivered. In some situations, the files are broken into chunks and served by special-
ized video servers to client software that puts the chunks together and plays the video. 
In other situations, a single large file is delivered from a standard web server to a user 
who can begin playing the video before the entire file is delivered.  Streamed files 
must be viewed in real time; they cannot be stored on client hard drives without 
special software. Streamed files are “played” by a software program such as Windows 
Media Player, Apple QuickTime, Adobe Flash, and Real Player. There are a number 
of tools used to create streaming files, including HTML5 and Adobe Flash, as well as 
technologies specifically adapted for the mobile platform such as the Meerkat and 
Periscope apps. As the capacity of the Internet grows, streaming media will play an 
even larger role in e-commerce.
Spurred on by the worldwide sales of more than 2.5 billion iOS (iPhones, iPads, 
and iPod Touches) and Android devices, the Internet has become a virtual digital 
river of music, audio, and video files. The Apple iTunes store is probably the most 
well-known repository of digital music online, with a catalog of more than 43 million 
songs worldwide in its catalog as of September 2016. Google Play offers over 35 million, 
and there are hundreds of other sites offering music downloads as well. In addition, 
streaming music services and Internet radio, such as Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, 
Amazon Prime Music, Tidal, and hundreds of others, add to the bandwidth devoted 
to the delivery of online music.
Podcasting (the name originates from a mashup of the word “iPod” and the word 
“broadcasting”) is also surging in popularity. A podcast is an audio presentation—such 
as a radio show, audio from a conference, or simply a personal presentation—stored 
online as digital media file. Listeners can download the file and play it on their mobile 
devices or computers. Podcasting has transitioned from an amateur independent 
producer media in the “pirate radio” tradition to a professional news and talk content 
distribution channel. For instance, This American Life’s Serial podcast has been down-
loaded over 175 million times. NPR is the top U.S. producer of podcasts, with an 
aggregate monthly audience of almost 8 million, followed by WNYC Studios, a NYC-
based public broadcasting organization, with a monthly audience of about 6 million 
(Podtrac, Inc., 2016).

Online video viewing has also exploded in popularity. In 2016, for instance, there 
are around 215 million Americans that watch streaming or downloaded video content 
on a desktop or mobile device at least once a month (eMarketer, Inc., 2016j). Cisco 
estimates that consumer Internet video traffic constituted a whopping 70% of all 
consumer Internet traffic in 2015, and this percentage is expected to grow to 82% 
by 2020 (Cisco, 2016b). The Internet has become a major distribution channel for 
movies, television shows, and sporting events (see Chapter 10). Another common type 
of Internet video is provided by YouTube, with more than 1 billion users worldwide, 
who each day watch hundreds of millions of hours of video content, ranging from a 
wide variety of user-generated content, to branded content from major corporations, 
music videos, original programming, and more. Sites such as YouTube, Metacafe, 
and Facebook have popularized user-generated video streaming. Many apps such as 
Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and others also include video capabilities.
Online advertisers increasingly use video to attract viewers. Companies that want 
to demonstrate use of their products have found video clips to be extremely effective. 
Streaming video segments used in web ads and news stories are perhaps the most 
frequently used streaming services.  High-quality interactive video and audio makes 
sales presentations and demonstrations more effective and lifelike and enables com-
panies to develop new forms of customer support.
WEB 2.0 APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES
Today’s broadband Internet infrastructure has greatly expanded the services avail-
able to users. These capabilities have formed the basis for new business models. 
Web 2.0 applications and services are “social” in nature because they support com-
munication among individuals within groups or social networks.
Online Social Networks
Online social networks are services that support communication within networks of 
friends, colleagues, and entire professions. Online social networks have developed 
very large worldwide audiences (over 2.3 billion people in 2016, almost one-third of 
the world’s population) and form the basis for new advertising platforms and for social 
e-commerce (see Chapters 6, 7, and 11). The largest social networks are Facebook (1.7 
billion monthly active users worldwide), Instagram (500 million members worldwide), 
LinkedIn (more than 450 million members worldwide), Twitter (more than 310 million 
active users worldwide), and Pinterest (over 110 million active users). These networks 
rely on user-generated content (messages, photos, and videos) and emphasize sharing 
of content. All of these features require significant broadband Internet connectivity 
and equally large cloud computing facilities to store content.
Blogs
A blog (originally called a weblog) is a personal web page that typically contains a 
series of chronological entries (newest to oldest) by its author, and links to related web 
pages. The blog may include a blogroll (a collection of links to other blogs) and 
blog
personal web page that is 
created by an individual or 
corporation to 
communicate with readers

trackbacks (a list of entries in other blogs that refer to a post on the first blog). Most 
blogs allow readers to post comments on the blog entries as well. The act of creating 
a blog is often referred to as “blogging.” Blogs are either hosted by a third-party site 
such as WordPress, Tumblr, Blogger, LiveJournal, TypePad, and Xanga, or prospective 
bloggers can download software such as Movable Type to create a blog that is hosted 
by the user’s ISP. Blog pages are usually variations on templates provided by the blog-
ging service or software and hence require no knowledge of HTML. Therefore, millions 
of people without HTML skills of any kind can post their own web pages, and share 
content with friends and relatives. The totality of blog-related websites is often referred 
to as the “blogosphere.”
Blogs have become hugely popular. Tumblr and Wordpress together hosted over 
400 million blogs as of September 2016, so it is likely that the total number is signifi-
cantly higher. According to eMarketer, there are an estimated 29 million active U.S. 
bloggers, and 81 million U.S. blog readers (eMarketer, Inc., 2916k, 2016l). No one knows 
how many of these blogs are kept up to date or are just yesterday’s news. And no one 
knows how many of these blogs have a readership greater than one (the blog author). 
In fact, there are so many blogs you need a search engine just to find them, or you 
can just go to a list of the most popular 100 blogs and dig in.
Wikis
A wiki is a web application that allows a user to easily add and edit content on a web 
page. (The term wiki derives from the “wiki wiki” (quick or fast) shuttle buses at 
Honolulu Airport.) Wiki software enables documents to be written collectively and 
collaboratively. Most wiki systems are open source, server-side systems that store 
content in a relational database. The software typically provides a template that 
defines layout and elements common to all pages, displays user-editable source code 
(usually plain text), and then renders the content into an HTML-based page for display 
in a web browser. Some wiki software allows only basic text formatting, whereas others 
allow the use of tables, images, or even interactive elements, such as polls and games. 
Because wikis by their very nature are very open in allowing anyone to make changes 
to a page, most wikis provide a means to verify the validity of changes via a “Recent 
Changes” page, which enables members of the wiki community to monitor and review 
the work of other users, correct mistakes, and hopefully deter “vandalism.”
The most well-known wiki is Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia that contains 
more than 40 million articles in 294 different languages on a variety of topics. The 
Wikimedia Foundation, which operates Wikipedia, also operates a variety of related 
projects, including Wikibooks, a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks 
and manuals; Wikinews, a free content news source; and Wiktionary, a collaborative 
project to produce a free multilingual dictionary in every language, with definitions, 
etymologies, pronunciations, quotations, and synonyms.
VIRTUAL REALITY AND AUGMENTED REALITY
In 2016, virtual reality and augmented reality technologies began to enter the con-
sumer market and attract significant attention. Virtual reality (VR) involves fully 
immersing users within a virtual world, typically through the use of a head-mounted

display (HMD) connected to headphones and other devices that enable navigation 
through the experience and allowing users to feel as if they are actually present within 
the virtual world.  High-end VR devices designed to be used with PCs or gaming 
systems include Facebook’s Oculus Rift, HTC’s Vive, and Sony’s PlayStation VR.  Sam-
sung’s Gear VR and Google Cardboard are examples of lower-cost, mobile, entry-level 
devices. A number of publishers are experimented with VR content that can use these 
lower-cost devices. For example, the New York Times has a VR mobile app that viewers 
can use with Google Cardboard to view VR films and advertisements that feature 
360-degree video. By 2020, some analysts estimate that there will be almost 155 million 
virtual reality users worldwide (with around 135 million using a smartphone-powered 
device and another 20 million a higher-end PC/game console-related device). Aug-
mented reality (AR) involves overlaying virtual objects over the real world, via 
smartphones, tablets, or HMDs. Perhaps the highest profile use of AR thus far has been 
its use in Nintendo’s Pokemon GO game. Other uses include Snapchat’s Lenses feature, 
which uses facial recognition technology and 3-D models that allow users to augment 
their selfies by overlaying animations or other images on top of them, and “try-before-
you-buy” apps created for beauty and fashion brands (eMarketer, Inc., 2016m). 
INTELLIGENT PERSONAL ASSISTANTS
The idea of having a conversation with a computer, having it understand you and be 
able to carry out tasks according to your direction, has long been a part of science 
fiction, from the 1968 Hollywood movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, to an old Apple pro-
motional video depicting a professor using his personal digital assistant to organize 
his life, gather data, and place orders at restaurants. That was all fantasy. But Apple’s 
Siri, billed as an intelligent personal assistant and knowledge navigator and released in 
2011, has many of the capabilities of the computer assistants found in fiction. Siri has 
a natural language, conversational interface, situational awareness, and is capable of 
carrying out many tasks based on verbal commands by delegating requests to a variety 
of different web services. For instance, you can ask Siri to find a restaurant nearby that 
serves Italian food. Siri may show you an ad for a local restaurant in the process. Once 
you have identified a restaurant you would like to eat at, you can ask Siri to make a 
reservation using OpenTable. You can also ask Siri to place an appointment on your 
calendar, search for airline flights, and figure out what’s the fastest route between your 
current location and a destination using public transit. The answers are not always 
completely accurate, but critics have been impressed with its uncanny abilities. Siri is 
currently available on the Apple Watch, the iPhone 4S and later versions, iPads with 
Retina display, the iPad Mini, and iPod Touches (fifth generation and later versions).
In 2012, Google released its version of an intelligent assistant for Android-based 
smartphones, which it calls Google Now. Google Now is part of the Google Search 
mobile application. While Google Now has many of the capabilities of Apple’s Siri, it 
attempts to go further by predicting what users may need based on situational aware-
ness, including physical location, time of day, previous location history, calendar, and 
expressed interests based on previous activity, as described in its patent application 
(United States Patent Office, 2012). For instance, if you often search for a particular 
musician or style of music, Google Now might provide recommendations for similar 
augmented reality 
(AR) 
involves overlaying virtual 
objects over the real world, 
via smartphones, tablets or 
HMDs.

music. If it knows that you go to a health club every other day, Google Now will remind 
you not to schedule events during these periods. If it knows that you typically read 
articles about health issues, the system might monitor Google News for similar articles 
and make recommendations. In 2016, Google unveiled Google Assistant, a similar 
virtual assistant for its Allo chat app and integrated into its Google Home products 
and its new Pixel phones. Other intelligent personal assistants include Samsung’s 
S Voice, LG’s Voice Mate, and Microsoft’s Cortana. The Insight on Business case, AI, 
Intelligent Assistants, and Chatbots, focuses on the increasing use of AI technologies 
in e-commerce.

MOBILE APPS: THE NEXT BIG THING IS HERE
When Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone in January 2007, no one, including himself, 
envisioned that the device would launch a software revolution or become a major 
e-commerce platform, let alone a game platform, advertising platform, and general 
media platform for television shows, movies, videos, and e-books. The iPhone’s original 
primary functions, beyond being a cell phone, were to be a camera, text messaging 
device, and web browser. What Apple initially lacked for the iPhone were software 
applications (“apps”) that would take full advantage of its computing capabilities. The 
solution was apps developed by outside developers. In July 2008, Apple introduced 
the App Store, which provides a platform for the distribution and sale of apps by Apple 
as well as by independent developers. Around the same time, Google was developing 
Android as an open source operating system for mobile devices. In October 2008, the 
first smartphone using Android was released, and Google launched the Android Market 
(now called Google Play) as the official app store for Android. In 2010, tablet computers 
such as Apple’s iPad and the Samsung Galaxy Tab, which provided additional platforms 
for mobile apps, were introduced.  
As of June 2016, more than 130 billion apps have been downloaded from the App 
Store, and there are over 2 million approved apps available for download. There are 
over 2 million apps available for Android devices on Google Play as well. And while 
the number of cumulative downloads of Android apps is not publicly available, Google 
has announced that Android users downloaded over 65 billion apps between May 2015 
and May 2016 alone.
The mobile app phenomenon has spawned a new digital ecosystem: tens of thou-
sands of developers, a wildly popular hardware platform, and millions of consumers 
now using a mobile device to replace their clunky desktop-laptop Microsoft Windows 
computer and act as a digital media center as well. Mobile apps have even usurped 
TV as the most popular entertainment medium. A 2015 report from Flurry found that 
the average U.S. consumer now spends nearly 200 minutes per day within apps, well 
ahead of the 168 minutes spent watching TV. As recently as 2014, TV was still comfort-
ably ahead of apps. More consumers are opting to consume media on their phones 
and tablet computers than ever before, which is more good news for app developers.

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
AI, INTELLIGENT ASSISTANTS, AND CHATBOTS
Despite the frequent appearances of 
robots and advanced artificial intel-
ligence (AI) in books and movies over 
the past several decades, real-world 
equivalents have lagged hopelessly behind. 
However, today’s tech titans are doubling their 
efforts to improve AI technologies in an effort to 
get a jump on the competition. We may still be a 
long way away from R2-D2, but AI in the form of 
personalization systems, chatbots, and intelligent 
assistants is finally entering the mainstream.
AI systems of the past have had frustrat-
ingly limited capabilities. Asking them to perform 
tasks outside of their purpose or to interpret and 
respond to the variation and nuances of human 
language simply doesn’t work. Even tools like 
search engines, which have the ability to distin-
guish between different types of language and 
queries, can’t incorporate context.
Although companies like Amazon have made 
use of more complex forms of AI to power their 
personalization and recommendation engines, 
this mostly occurs behind the scenes—customers 
aren’t interacting directly with these types of AI 
technologies. However, advances in natural lan-
guage processing techniques have enabled Amazon 
to develop exciting new technologies like the 
Amazon Echo and its underlying AI technology, 
which Amazon calls Alexa. The Echo is marketed 
as a home assistant that can perform a variety 
of tasks using speech recognition, but is still in 
its infancy as a product. Currently, the Echo can 
update to-do lists, adjust home appliances, play 
games, and stream music, all controlled by voice.
Echo and Alexa are powered by these and 
other “skills,” which function much like apps do 
on the iPhone, and which third-party developers 
are lining up in droves to develop. For example, 
1-800-Flowers was one of the first large retail-
ers to develop a skill that allows users to place 
orders by voice alone on any device running 
Alexa, including the Echo and the Amazon Fire 
TV. Although customers interested in using this 
capability must have account info, payment info, 
and addresses already on file, this represents a 
major breakthrough. Other companies developing 
skills for Alexa include Domino’s, Capital One, 
Ford Motor, and many more. Amazon is hoping 
that in the future, people will be able to ask Alexa 
what they should buy and receive an intelligent, 
relevant response.
Although Echo and Alexa are perhaps the 
most visible sign of growth in artificial intelligence 
and natural language processing, the modern tech-
nological landscape is defined by its multitude of 
platforms. Retailers are trying to encourage their 
customers to do business with them on each and 
every one of them. Many of these platforms are 
text-based, and the number of people using mes-
saging apps is skyrocketing in the United States, 
from 113 million in 2015 to a projected 177 
million by 2019. To that end, companies have been 
rolling out “chatbots”—AI that can interact with 
users via text and automate many parts of the pur-
chasing process that are currently manual, such as 
talking on the phone or navigating online menus.
Facebook Messenger is one of the most 
popular messaging apps, trailing only WhatsApp 
in monthly active users. Facebook M is a virtual 
assistant within Messenger launched in 2015 that 
can perform a variety of tasks via text, including 
making restaurant reservations, booking travel 
plans, and helping find birthday gifts. Facebook 
has also opened the Messenger platform to third-
party chatbots from other companies, including 
the previously mentioned 1-800-Flowers as well

as others like Uber. Increasingly, popular 
workplace messaging tool Slack has done 
the same with its platform, and companies like 
Taco Bell have developed tools like TacoBot that 
allow Slack users to order food through a brief 
text conversation.
Seemingly every prominent tech company 
and messaging platform has an AI that it hopes 
will dominate the emerging marketplace. Amazon 
has Alexa and Facebook has M; Apple has Siri, 
perhaps the best known intelligent assistant; 
Google has Google Now and Google Assistant; 
Microsoft has Cortana. Google also unveiled its 
Google Home appliance, which is modeled after 
the Echo but which reportedly has better con-
versational functionality and ability to integrate 
with home speakers. In the same vein, Samsung 
announced the Samsung Otto device, which comes 
equipped with features Echo lacks like an HD 
camera and facial recognition capability. These 
companies are all positioning themselves to take 
part in the impending boom in virtual assistant 
technologies. Analysts anticipate that virtual 
assistants of all types will have 1.8 billion active 
global users by 2021, up from 390 million in 
2016.
Other players have emerged as well. The 
developers of the AI that powers Apple’s Siri have 
developed a new platform called Viv that goes 
far beyond Siri’s functionality. Viv can answer 
much more complicated questions than Siri, such 
as “Will it be warmer than 70 degrees near the 
Golden Gate Bridge after 5 PM the day after 
tomorrow?” Viv can also book flights by using 
your preferred airline, frequent flyer number, and 
seating preference, all without any human guid-
ance, and might someday have the ability to auto-
matically detect low fares.
A primary goal of all of these technologies is 
to facilitate sales. Intelligent personal assistants 
and chatbots might be able to understand what it 
is that we’re looking for as consumers even when 
we’re not sure how to phrase it or what we’re 
even looking for. If AI continues to improve and 
people learn to trust technologies like chatbots, the 
importance of websites and native apps is likely to 
greatly diminish, and web search may also take a 
hit. That’s part of the reason why Google has been 
so active in this area, perhaps sensing a threat to 
its core business model.
Interestingly, Microsoft has eight full-time 
writers who formulate Cortana’s responses to 
user queries. The team’s goal is for Cortana to 
exhibit the type of multi-dimensional intelligence 
that humans display—social intelligence, emotion, 
humor, and a point of view. Whichever intelligent 
assistant is most successful at this is likely to have 
a leg up on the others. Although these technologies 
still require plenty of human guidance (Facebook 
M reportedly has a staff of human customer 
service agents on hand to handle difficult queries), 
the time may finally have arrived where interacting 
directly with AI becomes a part of our everyday 
lives.

The implications of the app ecosystem for e-commerce are significant. The smart-
phone in your pocket or the tablet computer on your lap becomes not only a general-
purpose computer, but also an always-present shopping tool for consumers, as well as 
an entirely new marketing and advertising platform for vendors. Early e-commerce 
applications using desktops and laptops were celebrated as allowing people to shop 
in their pajamas. Smartphones and tablets extend this range from pajamas to office 
desktops to trains, planes, and cars, all fully clothed. You can shop anywhere, shop 
everywhere, and shop all the time, in between talking, texting, watching video, and 
listening to music. Almost all of the top 100 brands have a presence in at least one 
of the major app stores, and more than 90% have an app in the Apple App Store. 
M-commerce in the form of purchases of retail and travel products and services via a 
mobile device is expected to generate over $180 billion in 2016, while downloads of 
mobile apps and in-app purchases are expected to generate over $10 billion (eMarketer, 
Inc., 2016n, 2016o, 2016p). 
PLATFORMS FOR MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
Unlike mobile web sites, which can be accessed by any web-enabled mobile device, 
native apps, which are designed specifically to operate using the mobile device’s hard-
ware and operating system, are platform-specific. Applications for the iPhone, iPad, 
and other iOS devices are written in the Objective-C programming language using the 
iOS SDK (software developer kit). Applications for Android operating system–based 
phones typically are written using Java, although portions of the code may be in 
the C or C++ programming language. Applications for Windows mobile devices are 
written in C or C++. In addition to creating native apps using a programming language 
such as Objective C or Java, there are also hundreds of low-cost or open source app 
development toolkits that make creating cross-platform mobile apps relatively easy 
and inexpensive without having to use a device-specific programming language. See 
Section 4.6 in Chapter 4 for more information.
APP MARKETPLACES
Once written, applications are distributed through various marketplaces. Android apps 
for Android-based phones are distributed through Google Play, which is controlled 
by Google. iPhone applications are distributed through Apple’s App Store. Microsoft 
operates the Windows Phone Marketplace for Windows mobile devices. Apps can also 
be purchased from third-party vendors such as Amazon’s Appstore. It is important to 
distinguish “native” mobile apps, which run directly on a mobile device and rely on 
the device’s internal operating system, from web apps, which install into your browser, 
although these can operate in a mobile environment as well.

n 2016, the amount of Internet traffic generated by YouTube alone is greater 
than the amount of traffic on the entire Internet in 2000. Because of video 
streaming and the explosion in mobile devices demanding high-bandwidth 
applications, Internet traffic has increased over 500% since 2010 and is pre-
dicted to nearly triple by 2019 (see Figure 3.19). Internet video is now a majority of 
Internet traffic and will reach 82% by 2020, according to Cisco. Experts call services 
like YouTube, Netflix, and high definition streaming video “net bombs” because they 
threaten the effective operation of the Internet. Mobile platform traffic grew by almost 
75% in 2015 and may soon push cellular networks and the Internet to their capacities.

Cisco estimates that annual global Internet traffic will be around 2.3 zettabytes in 2020: 
that’s 2,300 exabytes, or, in other words, 23 with 19 zeroes behind it!
In today’s broadband environment, the threshold of patience is very low. Increased 
video and audio customer expectations are bad news for anyone seeking to use the 
Web for delivery of high-quality multimedia content and high definition video. Akamai 
is one of the Web’s major helpers, and an overwhelming majority of the Web’s top 
companies use Akamai’s services to speed the delivery of content. Akamai serves more 
than 30 terabits of web traffic per second.
Slow-loading web pages and content sometimes result from poor design, but more 
often than not, the problem stems from the underlying infrastructure of the Internet. 
The Internet is a collection of networks that has to pass information from one network 
to another. Sometimes the handoff is not smooth. Every 1,500-byte packet of information 
sent over the Internet must be verified by the receiving server and an acknowledgment 
sent to the sender. This slows down not only the distribution of content such as music, 
but also slows down interactive requests, such as purchases, that require the client com-
puter to interact with an online shopping cart. Moreover, each packet may go through 
many different servers on its way to its final destination, multiplying by several orders of 
magnitude the number of acknowledgments required to move a packet from New York to 
San Francisco. The Internet today spends much of its time and capacity verifying packets, 
contributing to a problem called “latency” or delay. For this reason, a single e-mail with a 
1-megabyte attached PDF file can create more than 50 megabytes of Internet traffic and 
data storage on servers, client hard drives, and network backup drives.
Akamai Technologies was founded by Tom Leighton, an MIT professor of applied 
mathematics, and Daniel Lewin, an MIT grad student, with the idea of expediting 
Internet traffic to overcome these limitations. Lewin’s master’s thesis was the theoreti-
cal starting point for the company. It described storing copies of web content such 
as pictures or video clips at many different locations around the Internet so that one 
could always retrieve a nearby copy, making web pages load faster.
Officially launched in August 1998, Akamai’s current products are based on the 
Akamai Intelligent Platform, a cloud platform made up of over 216,000 servers in 
120 countries within over 1,500 networks around the world, and all within a single 
network hop of 85% of all Internet users. Akamai software on these servers allows the 
platform to identify and block security threats and provide comprehensive knowledge 
of network conditions, as well as instant device-level detection and optimization. 
Akamai’s site performance products allow customers to move their online content 
closer to end users so a user in New York City, for instance, will be served L.L.Bean 
pages from the New York Metro area Akamai servers, while users of the L.L.Bean site 
in San Francisco will be served pages from Akamai servers in San Francisco. Akamai 
has a wide range of large corporate and government clients: 1 out of every 3 global 
Fortune 500 companies, the top 30 media and entertainment companies, 96 of the 
top 100 online U.S. retailers, all branches of the U.S. military, all the major U.S. sports 
leagues, and so on. In 2015, Akamai delivers between 15% and 30% of all web traffic, 
and over 3 trillion daily Internet interactions. Other competitors in the content deliv-
ery network (CDN) industry include Limelight Networks, Level 3 Communications, 
and Mirror Image Internet.

Accomplishing this daunting task requires that Akamai monitor the entire Inter-
net, locating potential sluggish areas and devising faster routes for information to 
travel. Frequently used portions of a client’s website, or large video or audio files 
that would be difficult to send to users quickly, are stored on Akamai’s servers. When 
a user requests a song or a video file, his or her request is redirected to an Akamai 
server nearby and the content is served from this local server. Akamai’s servers are 
placed in Tier 1 backbone supplier networks, large ISPs, universities, and other net-
works. Akamai’s software determines which server is optimal for the user and then 
transmits the “Akamaized” content locally. Web sites that are “Akamaized” can be 
delivered anywhere from 4 to 10 times as fast as non-Akamaized content. Akamai has 
developed a number of other business services based on its Internet savvy, including 
targeted advertising based on user location and zip code, content security, business 
intelligence, disaster recovery, on-demand bandwidth and computing capacity during 
spikes in Internet traffic, storage, global traffic management, and streaming services. 
You can see several interesting visualizations of the Internet that log basic real-time 
online activity by visiting the Akamai website.
The shift toward cloud computing and the mobile platform as well as the growing 
popularity of streaming video have provided Akamai with new growth opportunities. As 
more businesses and business models are moving to the Web, Akamai has seen its client 
base continue to grow beyond the most powerful Internet retailers and online content 
providers. In 2014, Akamai made a push to encourage Hollywood studios to use the 
cloud for feature films, touting its ability to handle uploads and downloads of large video 
files, to quickly convert files from one format to another, and to apply DRM protections. 
Establishing partnerships with movie studios represented big business for Akamai, with 
an increasing amount of media consumption taking place on mobile devices through 
the cloud. Akamai has also made agreements to become the primary content delivery 
platform for cloud service providers like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform.
However, the growth of streaming video has also created new challenges for 
Akamai, including increased competition from Comcast and Amazon, which have built 
competing content delivery services. Amazon’s Cloudfront content delivery network 
is already bringing in $1.8 billion in revenues. Larger clients like Apple and Facebook 
are also increasingly shifting their content delivery operations away from Akamai’s 
platforms and onto in-house content delivery networks. Reducing carbon emissions 
and energy expenditure as demand grows has been another challenge for Akamai. In 
response, the company has undertaking sweeping efforts to reduce its greenhouse gas 
emissions to below 2015 levels by 2020 despite significantly higher demand.
Akamai is also acutely aware of the increase in cybercrime as more traffic migrates 
to the Internet. Growth in Internet traffic is good news for Akamai, but the company 
must also now deal with politically motivated cyberattacks, organized crime online, 
and state-sponsored cyberwarfare. Akamai has continued to improve its Kona Site 
Defender tool, which offers a variety of security measures for Akamai clients. The tool 
protects against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and includes a firewall 
for web applications. In 2016, Akamai rolled out new improvements to Kona’s web 
application firewall and analytics features. Akamai also upgraded Site Defender’s Web 
Application Firewall feature and developed modifications to the tool that make it easier

for its users to use. With so many businesses now dependent on the uninterrupted 
flow of content over the Internet, Akamai is in a very strong position to sell security 
services to its customers. In 2015, Akamai partnered with top information security firm 
Trustwave to cross-sell each other’s services and products, expanding their offerings 
and reaching even further. Akamai made a similar agreement with China Unicom, 
a provider of cloud services in the fast-growing Chinese market. Akamai has also 
set itself up for future growth by moving into areas of the world with less developed 
broadband infrastructure, such as the Middle East. In 2015, Akamai opened an office in 
Dubai, hoping to bolster its presence in an area where the adoption rate for broadband 
is skyrocketing. 
In 2016, experiencing rapidly increasing demand from its clients for security 
tools, Akamai announced it would restructure its business into two distinct units, 
one focusing on content delivery and media, and the other on website security. The 
improvements in Akamai’s security businesses have offset any slowdown in their 
content delivery business, as the company registered earnings well above analyst 
estimates in 2016 despite increased competition in content delivery. Akamai has plans 
to increase its suite of security tools going forward, with tools designed to protect 
employees from phishing and malware due to be released in 2017. While the future 
of its content delivery business is cloudier due to increased competition and the chal-
lenges of Internet growth, the company is still very profitable.
Case Study Questions
1.	 Why does Akamai need to geographically disperse its servers to deliver its cus-
tomers’ web content?
2.	 If you wanted to deliver software content over the Internet, would you sign up for 
Akamai’s service? Why or why not?
3.	 Do you think Internet users should be charged based on the amount of band-
width they consume, or on a tiered plan where users would pay in rough propor-
tion to their usage?

REVIEW
K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Discuss the origins of, and the key technology concepts behind, the Internet.
•	
The Internet has evolved from a collection of mainframe computers located on a few U.S. college cam-
puses to an interconnected network of thousands of networks and millions of computers worldwide.
•	
The history of the Internet can be divided into three phases: the Innovation Phase (1961–1974), the Insti-
tutionalization Phase (1975–1995), and the Commercialization Phase (1995 to the present).

•	
Packet switching, TCP/IP, and client/server technology are key technology concepts behind the Internet.
•	
The mobile platform has become the primary means for accessing the Internet.
•	
Cloud computing refers to a model of computing in which firms and individuals obtain computing power 
and software applications over the Internet, rather than purchasing the hardware and software and 
installing it on their own computers.
•	
Internet protocols and utility programs such as BGP, HTTP, SMTP and POP, SSL and TLS, FTP, Telnet, 
Ping, and Tracert provide a number of Internet services.
Explain the current structure of the Internet.
•	
The main structural elements of the Internet are the backbone (composed primarily high-bandwidth fiber 
optic cable), IXPs (hubs that use high-speed switching computers to connect to the backbone), CANs 
(campus/corporate area networks), and ISPs (which deal with the “last mile” of service to homes and 
offices).
•	
Governing bodies, such as IAB, ICANN, IESG, IETF, ISOC, and W3C, have influence over the Internet and 
monitor its operations, although they do not control it.
Understand the limitations of today’s Internet and the potential capabilities of the Internet of the future.
•	
To envision what the Internet of tomorrow will look like, we must first look at the limitations of today’s 
Internet, which include bandwidth limitations, quality of service limitations, network architecture limita-
tions, language limitations, and limitations arising from the wired nature of the Internet.
•	
Internet2 is a consortium working together to develop and test new technologies for potential use on the 
Internet. Other groups are working to expand Internet bandwidth via improvements to fiber optics. Wire-
less and cellular technologies are providing users of mobile devices with increased access to the Internet 
and its various services. The increased bandwidth and expanded connections will result in a number of 
benefits, including latency solutions; guaranteed service levels; lower error rates; and declining costs. 
The Internet of Things will be a big part of the Internet of the future, with more and more sensor-
equipped machines and devices connected to the Internet.
Understand how the Web works.
•	
The Web was developed during 1989–1991 by Dr. Tim Berners-Lee, who created a computer program that 
allowed formatted pages stored on the Internet to be linked using keywords (hyperlinks). In 1993, Marc 
Andreessen created the first graphical web browser, which made it possible to view documents on the 
Web graphically and created the possibility of universal computing.
•	
The key concepts you need to be familiar with in order to understand how the Web works are hypertext, 
HTTP, URLs, HTML, XML, web server software, web clients, and web browsers.
Describe how Internet and web features and services support e-commerce.
•	
Together, the Internet and the Web make e-commerce possible by allowing computer users to access 
product and service information and to complete purchases online.
•	
Some of the specific features that support e-commerce include communication tools such as e-mail, mes-
saging applications, online message boards, Internet telephony, video conferencing, video chatting, and 
telepresence; search engines; and downloadable and streaming media.
•	
Web 2.0 applications and services include social networks, blogs, and wikis.
•	
Virtual reality, augmented reality and artificial intelligence technologies have begun to enter the con-
sumer market and attract significant attention.
Understand the impact of mobile applications.
•	
The mobile app phenomenon has spawned a new digital ecosystem.

	
R e v i e w 	

183
•	
Smartphone and tablet users spent the majority of their time using mobile apps rather than the mobile Web.
•	
There are a variety of different platforms for mobile application development including Objective-C (for 
iOS devices), Java (Android smartphones), and C and C++ (Windows mobile devices).
•	
Mobile apps for the iPhone are distributed through Apple's App Store, for Android devices through Google 
Play, and for Windows mobile devices through Microsoft’s Windows Phone Marketplace. There are also 
third-party vendors such as Amazon's Appstore.

F
or 125 years, the Wall 
Street Journal (WSJ) 
has been a venerated 
newspaper with a focus on business 
and a well-educated, discerning 
readership. It consistently ranks as 
one of the top publications world-
wide in terms of number of sub-
scribers (currently approximately 
2.8 million). Despite its pedigree 
as one of the most recognizable 
and respected newspapers in the 
world, WSJ has also made an effort 
to stay on the cutting edge in an 
industry that has seen significant 
disruption in the past decade. It 
was a pioneer in developing a pay 
wall for its digital content in 1997, 
which met with skepticism and even ridicule at first, but is now increasingly common 
among online newspapers. WSJ was also one of the first news organizations with its own 
app for the iPad, released in 2010.
From 2010 to 2015, however, WSJ began to lag behind other newspapers and web-
sites as devices became smaller, more streamlined, and more specialized. Although it was 
a first mover into the mobile space, other papers like the Financial Times and USA Today 
made sweeping changes to their websites and mobile offerings during this time period 
that better suited mobile browsing. WSJ had not redesigned its website since 2008. To 
make matters worse, in 2015, Google updated its search algorithms to prioritize sites 
that are optimized for mobile devices, which caused WSJ’s search results to suffer. The 
company wasn’t alone in that regard, with nearly half of the websites belonging to Fortune 
500 companies failing to achieve “mobile-friendliness,” according to Google, including 
a surprising 29% of retail sites, where mobile search is critical to maintaining revenue 
growth. However, with many publishing companies already struggling to adjust to the new 
online world, WSJ decided it had no more time to waste.
In 2015, WSJ undertook a complete redesign of its website and mobile apps across 
multiple platforms. It released new iPad and Android apps with a variety of new features 
to improve user experience, and followed those up with the release of apps for the Apple 
Watch and for the Windows 10 operating system. It also added its first mobile-only 
product, an app that features a curated digest of 10 stories that is refreshed during the

day, patterned after the What’s News column that appears on the front page of the print 
version. WSJ also launched a London-specific app called WSJ City that provides frequent 
updates on the most significant business news in London. In 2016, WSJ announced plans 
to launch more apps with specific functions akin to What’s News and WSJ City. The paper 
also launched the WSJ.D niche site, which focuses on technology news, analysis, com-
mentary, and product reviews. The overhaul was more than just cosmetic. Organizationally, 
it also integrated the team that works on new technology products and design elements 
into the news room, so that the editors themselves can have direct input into shaping 
the technological future of WSJ. This move has helped WSJ keep pace with other top 
newspapers, including the Washington Post, which has almost 50 engineers working in 
its newsroom. In 2016, WSJ also announced continued changes to the organizational 
structure of its newsroom to improve its digital efforts further.
One of the most critical objectives of the overhaul was to ensure that the user experi-
ence was consistent across all of the different devices that readers use today and in the 
future. Being able to save an article on the iPad and open the app on your iPhone or log 
in to the website and see the same article with your progress saved was a top priority for 
WSJ. The number of options for navigating articles was reduced for simplicity and ease 
of use, with the number of exposed navigation options dropping by nearly half on many 
pages. In the past, options were different on different devices and appeared in different 
places on the screen, confusing readers attempting to move from one device to another. 
Using an iOS feature called Handoff, WSJ allows users to save stories across all of their 
devices and to carry over the “graying out” of article headlines that have been read across 
those devices as well. It also allows users to access its Watchlist stock portfolio service 
across all devices.
In addition to making the user experience more consistent across devices, WSJ hoped 
to improve it. The app versions of WSJ are more responsive and more visually appealing. 
Graphical elements are more prominent and even interactive. The app loads faster, which 
had been an area where it trailed its competitors in the past. WSJ wanted the reading 
experience to feel natural on any device, which required it to optimize its apps for the 
screen size of the latest generation of Apple and Android phones. As devices continue to 
evolve in size, so too will the WSJ app experience. On a desktop, users can mouse over 
and click precise areas, but on a mobile device, users can swipe and tilt the device. In 
general, WSJ seeks to minimize interactions requiring precise taps on mobile as well as 
to reduce the amount of the screen that is fixed from page to page. Making interactive 
maps suitable for mobile can be particularly difficult, but WSJ is fine-tuning its approach.
Most of the feedback on the design changes has been positive. Elements that many 
readers had requested were added, including a “Market Data Center” featured prominently 
on the new website home page with essential information on the status of the stock 
markets that day. The iOS app also includes a Journal widget that places top stories of the 
day alongside other daily notifications, such as appointments and weather alerts. Users 
can swipe directly from their widget menu to move straight to the story within the WSJ 
app. From a user perspective, the new site and apps provide a large number of content 
choices, while also offering a variety of advertising opportunities, which is beneficial from 
WSJ’s perspective.

As traffic continues to shift to the mobile platform, providing these advertising op-
portunities will become increasingly important to WSJ’s continued success. In 2008, 10% 
of WSJ’s traffic came via mobile devices. That figure sits at 55% in 2016 and continues 
to grow quickly. WSJ has about 900,000 digital-only subscribers, trailing the New York 
Times (1 million) and coming in ahead of the Financial Times (over 520,000), but most 
of its 1.5 million print edition subscribers also have all-access subscriptions. Although 
measuring subscription numbers has become more complicated as the number of digital 
devices and reading platforms has grown, the trend away from print and towards digital 
has long been clear throughout the industry. But despite the proliferation of the mobile 
platform, two-thirds of WSJ’s subscribers visit the website home page each month. 
Realizing this, WSJ included the website as a key component of its redesign. As it turns 
out, readers use whatever device is convenient at the time—desktop in the office and 
mobile devices when moving about. 
Another effect of the wider array of options for WSJ subscribers is that different 
trends and reading patterns emerge on each platform. To capture this new data, WSJ is 
upgrading its analytics capabilities, with the goal of using them in the newsroom and in 
its larger business strategy. One example of this approach already delivering results is 
the breakdown of device usage by WSJ readers. Tablet usage of the WSJ app is growing 
at approximately 10% per year, but smartphone usage is growing by 30% to 40%, sug-
gesting that the smartphone app experience should be WSJ’s major focus going forward. 
Additionally, WSJ has found that app users are more active and engaged than web browser 
users, spending more time in the app and reading more articles than other types of users. 
App users are also likelier to maintain their subscriptions than any other type of user. 
WSJ also dropped its LinkedIn share button in 2016 because its analytics indicated that 
it siphoned off more traffic than it returned.
Many of the features that WSJ engineers are working on are tailored specifically for 
the app experience. One goal is to provide live video coverage via mobile devices. Another 
is to improve push alerts to make them more relevant to users. By analyzing reader data 
to understand what types of stories are most appealing to individual users or different 
demographics of users, WSJ can provide custom push alerts that are likeliest to motivate 
readers to swipe and move to the app. Another feature in development is a “Read-it-later” 
button that allows users to tag stories on any platform and view them later within their 
app. WSJ will also continue to optimize its Apple Watch app, which allows users to tilt 
the watch while looking at a headline to make that story available on the iPhone app.
Going forward, WSJ hopes to begin work on other features that will help in the 
future as early as possible. This means the paper will be continuously redesigning itself 
on a rolling basis. By integrating its engineering and product teams into the newsroom, 
it is much better positioned to achieve this level of development. For example, WSJ is 
one of the first organizations experimenting with virtual reality technology to improve 
its reporting. To that end, it updated its apps with built-in 360-degree video and virtual 
reality capability. With its sweeping redesign across all platforms, WSJ has once again 
solidified its status as an industry leader, even in this brave new world of news media.

n Chapter 3, you learned about e-commerce’s technological foundation: the 
Internet, the Web, and the mobile platform. In this chapter, you will examine 
the important factors that a manager needs to consider when building an 
e-commerce presence. The focus will be on the managerial and business decisions you 
must make before you begin, and that you will continually need to make. Although 
building a sophisticated e-commerce presence isn’t easy, today’s tools are much less 
expensive and far more powerful than they were during the early days of e-commerce. 
At the same time, the proliferation of mobile devices and social networks adds com-
plexity because firms need to build a presence on three platforms: the Web, mobile, 
and social networks. In this chapter, we focus on both small and medium-sized busi-
nesses as well as much larger corporate entities that serve thousands of customers a 
day, or even an hour. As you will see, although the scale may be very different, the 
principles and considerations are basically the same.
	 4.1	
IMAGINE YOUR E-COMMERCE PRESENCE
Before you begin to build a website or app of your own, there are some important 
questions you will need to think about and answer. The answers to these questions 
will drive the development and implementation of your e-commerce presence. 
WHAT’S THE IDEA? (THE VISIONING PROCESS)
Before you can plan and actually build an e-commerce presence, you need to have a 
vision of what you hope to accomplish and how you hope to accomplish it. The vision 
includes not just a statement of mission, but also identification of the target audience, 
characterization of the market space, a strategic analysis, a marketing matrix, and a 
development timeline. It starts with a dream of what’s possible, and concludes with a 
timeline and preliminary budget for development.
If you examine any successful website, you can usually tell from the home page 
what the vision that inspires the site is. If the company is a public company, you 
can often find a succinct statement of its vision or mission in the reports it files with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission. For Amazon, it’s to become the largest 
marketplace on earth. For Facebook, it’s to make the world more open and con-
nected. For Google, it’s to organize the world’s information and make it universally 
accessible and useful. The e-commerce presence you want to build may not have 
such all-encompassing ambitions, but a succinct statement of mission, purpose, and 
direction is the key factor in driving the development of your project. For instance, 
the mission of TheKnot is to be the Internet’s comprehensive, one-stop wedding 
planning solution. 
WHERE’S THE MONEY: BUSINESS AND REVENUE MODEL
Once you have defined a mission statement, a vision, you need to start thinking 
about where the money will be coming from. You will need to develop a preliminary 
idea of your business and revenue models. You don’t need detailed revenue and cost 

	
I m a g i n e  Y o u r  E - c o m m e r c e  P r e s e n c e 	

191
projections at this point. Instead, you need a general idea of how your business will 
generate revenues. The basic choices have been described in Chapter 2. Basic business 
models include portal, e-tailer, content provider, transaction broker, market creator, 
service provider, and community provider (social network). 
The basic revenue model alternatives are advertising, subscriptions, transaction 
fees, sales, and affiliate revenue. There’s no reason to adopt a single business or 
revenue model, and in fact, many firms have multiple models. For instance, the New 
York Times digital business model is to both sell subscriptions and sell ad space. In 
addition, they sell unique photographs and gifts. At TheKnot, a vertical portal for the 
wedding industry, you will find ads, affiliate relationships, and sponsorships from 
major creators of wedding products and services, including a directory to local wedding 
planners, all of which produce revenue for TheKnot. PetSmart, the most popular pet 
website in the United States, has a more focused sales revenue model, and presents 
itself almost entirely as an e-tailer of pet supplies. 
WHO AND WHERE IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE?
Without a clear understanding of your target audience, you will not have a successful 
e-commerce presence. There are two questions here: who is your target audience 
and where can you best reach them? Your target audience can be described in a 
number of ways: demographics, behavior patterns (lifestyle), current consumption 
patterns (online vs. offline purchasing), digital usage patterns, content creation pref-
erences (blogs, social networks, sites like Pinterest), and buyer personas (profiles of 
your typical customer). Understanding the demographics of your target audience is 
usually the first step. Demographic information includes age, income, gender, and 
location. In some cases, this may be obvious and in others, much less so. For instance, 
Harley-Davidson sells motorcycles to a very broad demographic range of varying 
ages, incomes, and locations, from 34-year-olds to 65-year-olds. Although most of the 
purchasers are middle-aged men, with middle incomes, many of the men ride with 
women, and the Harley-Davidson website has a collection of women’s clothing and 
several web pages devoted to women riders. While the majority of men who purchase 
Harley-Davidsons have modest incomes, a significant group of purchasers are profes-
sionals with above-average incomes. Hence, the age and income demographic target is 
quite broad. What ties Harley-Davidson riders together is not their shared demograph-
ics, but their love of the motorcycles and the brand, and the lifestyle associated with 
touring the highways of America on a powerful motorcycle that sounds like a potato 
popper. In contrast, a company like TheKnot is aimed at women in the 18–34-year-old 
range who are in varying stages of getting married, with lifestyles that include shop-
ping online, using smartphones and tablets, downloading apps, and using Facebook. 
This audience is technologically hip. These women read and contribute to blogs, 
comment on forums, and use Pinterest to find ideas for fashion. A “typical” visitor to 
TheKnot would be a 28-year-old woman who has an engagement ring, is just starting 
the wedding planning process, has an income of $45,000, lives in the Northeast, and is 
interested in a beach wedding. There are, of course, other “typical” profiles. For each 
profile for your website you will need to develop a detailed description.

WHAT IS THE BALLPARK? CHARACTERIZE THE MARKETPLACE
The chances of your success will depend greatly on the characteristics of the market 
you are about to enter, and not just on your entrepreneurial brilliance. Enter into a 
declining market filled with strong competitors, and you will multiply your chances 
of failure. Enter into a market that is emerging, growing, and has few competitors, and 
you stand a better chance. Enter a market where there are no players, and you will 
either be rewarded handsomely with a profitable monopoly on a successful product 
no one else thought of (Apple) or you will be quickly forgotten because there isn’t a 
market for your product at this point in time (the Franklin e-book reader circa 1999). 
Features of the marketplace to focus on include the demographics of the market 
and how an e-commerce presence fits into the market. In addition, you will want to 
know about the structure of the market: competitors and substitute products. 
What are the features of the marketplace you are about to enter? Is the market 
growing, or receding in size? If it’s growing, among which age and income groups? Is 
the marketplace shifting from offline to online delivery? If so, is the market moving 
toward traditional websites, mobile, and/or tablets? Is there a special role for a mobile 
presence in this market? What percentage of your target audience uses a website, 
smartphone, or tablet? What about social networks? What’s the buzz on products like 
yours? Are your potential customers talking about the products and services you want 
to offer on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or blogs? How many blogs focus on products 
like yours? How many Twitter posts mention similar offerings? How many Facebook 
Likes (signs of customer engagement) are attached to products you want to offer? 
The structure of the market is described in terms of your direct competitors, 
suppliers, and substitute products. You will want to make a list of the top five or ten 
competitors and try to describe their market share, and distinguishing characteristics. 
Some of your competitors may offer traditional versions of your products, while others 
will offer new renditions or versions of products that have new features. You need 
to find out everything you can about your competitors. What’s the market buzz on 
your competitors? How many unique monthly visitors (UMVs) do they have? How 
many Facebook Likes, Twitter followers, and/or Pinterest followers? How are your 
competitors using social sites and mobile devices as a part of their online presence. Is 
there something special you could do with social networks that your competitors do 
not? Do a search on customer reviews of their products. You can find online services 
(some of them free) that will measure the number of online conversations about your 
competitors, and the total share of Internet voice each of your competitors receives. 
Do your competitors have a special relationship with their suppliers that you may not 
have access to? Exclusive marketing arrangements would be one example of a special 
supplier relationship. Finally, are there substitutes for your products and services? 
For instance, your site may offer advice to the community of pet owners, but local pet 
stores or local groups may be a more trusted source of advice on pets. 
WHERE’S THE CONTENT COMING FROM? 
Websites are like books: they’re composed of a lot of pages that have content ranging 
from text, to graphics, photos, and videos. This content is what search engines catalog 

	
I m a g i n e  Y o u r  E - c o m m e r c e  P r e s e n c e 	

193
as they crawl through all the new and changed web pages on the Internet. The content 
is why your customers visit your site and either purchase things or look at ads that 
generate revenue for you. Therefore, the content is the single most important founda-
tion for your revenue and ultimate success. 
There are generally two kinds of content: static and dynamic. Static content is 
text and images that do not frequently change, such as product descriptions, photos, 
or text that you create to share with your visitors. Dynamic content is content that 
changes regularly, say, daily or hourly. Dynamic content can be created by you, 
or increasingly, by bloggers and fans of your website and products. User-generated 
content has a number of advantages: it’s free, it engages your customer fan base, and 
search engines are more likely to catalog your site if the content is changing. Other 
sources of content, especially photos, are external websites that aggregate content 
such as Pinterest, discussed in the closing case study in Chapter 1. 
KNOW YOURSELF: CONDUCT A SWOT ANALYSIS
A SWOT analysis is a simple but powerful method for strategizing about your business 
and understanding where you should focus your efforts. In a SWOT analysis you 
describe your strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities. In the example SWOT 
analysis in Figure 4.1, you will see a profile of a typical startup venture that includes 
a unique approach to an existing market, a promise of addressing unmet needs in this 
market, and the use of newer technologies (social and mobile platforms) that older 
competitors may have overlooked. There are many opportunities to address a large 
market with unmet needs, as well as the potential to use the initial website as a home 
base and spin-off related or nearby sites, leveraging the investment in design and 
SWOT analysis 
describes a firm’s strengths, 
weaknesses, opportunities, 
and threats

technology. But there are also weaknesses and threats. Lack of financial and human 
resources are typically the biggest weakness of startup companies. Threats include 
competitors that could develop the same capabilities as you, and low market entry 
costs, which might encourage many more startups to enter the marketplace. 
Once you have conducted a SWOT analysis, you can consider ways to overcome 
your weaknesses and build on your strengths. For instance, you could consider hiring 
or partnering to obtain technical and managerial expertise, and looking for financing 
opportunities (including friends and relatives). 
DEVELOP AN E-COMMERCE PRESENCE MAP 
E-commerce has moved from being a PC-centric activity on the Web to a mobile and 
tablet-based activity as well. While around 70% of e-commerce retail and travel rev-
enues are still generated by purchases made from a desktop computer, increasingly 
smartphones and tablets are being used for purchasing. Smartphones and tablets are 
also used by a majority of Internet users in the United States to shop for goods and 
services, explore purchase options, look up prices, and access social sites. Your poten-
tial customers use these various devices at different times during the day, and involve 
themselves in different conversations depending on what they are doing—touching 
base with friends, viewing photos on Instagram, tweeting, or reading a blog. Each of 
these are “touch points” where you can meet the customer, and you have to think about 
how you develop a presence in these different virtual places. Figure 4.2 provides a 
	
FIGURE 4.2	
E-COMMERCE PRESENCE MAP
An e-commerce presence requires firms to consider the four different kinds of presence, and the platforms 
and activities associated with each type of presence.

roadmap to the platforms and related activities you will need to think about when 
developing your e-commerce presence. 
Figure 4.2 illustrates four different kinds of e-commerce presence: website/app, 
e-mail, social media, and offline media. For each of these types there are different 
platforms that you will need to address. For instance, in the case of websites and/or 
apps, there are three different platforms: traditional desktop, tablets, and smartphones, 
each with different capabilities. And for each type of e-commerce presence there 
are related activities you will need to consider. For instance, in the case of websites 
and apps, you will want to engage in search engine marketing, display ads, affiliate 
programs, and sponsorships. Offline media, the fourth type of e-commerce presence, 
is included here because many firms use multiplatform or integrated marketing where 
print, television, or radio ads refer customers to websites and apps. The marketing 
activities in Figure 4.2 are described in much greater detail in Chapters 6 and 7. 
DEVELOP A TIMELINE: MILESTONES 
Where would you like to be a year from now? It’s a good idea for you to have a rough 
idea of the time frame for developing your e-commerce presence when you begin. You 
should break your project down into a small number of phases that could be completed 
within a specified time. Six phases are usually enough detail at this point. Table 4.1 
illustrates a one-year timeline for the development of a startup e-commerce company.
Note that this example timeline defers the development of a mobile plan until 
after a website and social media plan have been developed and implemented. There 
is a growing trend, however, to flip this timeline around, and begin with a mobile plan 
instead (sometimes referred to as mobile first design). Mobile first design has both 
advantages and disadvantages that will be examined more fully in Section 4.6.

HOW MUCH WILL THIS COST? 
It’s too early in the process to develop a detailed budget for your e-commerce presence, 
but it is a good time to develop a preliminary idea of the costs involved. How much you 
spend on a website, for instance, depends on what you want it to do. Simple websites 
can be built and hosted with a first-year cost of $5,000 or less if all the work is done 
in-house by yourself and others willing to work without pay. A more reasonable budget 
for a small startup using available tools and design services such as WordPress, might 
be $10,000 to $25,000. Here the firm owner would develop all the content at no cost, 
and a web designer and programmer would be hired to implement the initial website. 
As discussed later, the website would be hosted on a cloud-based server. The websites 
of large firms that offer high levels of interactivity and linkage to corporate systems 
can cost several hundred thousand to millions of dollars a year to create and operate. 
Large firms often outsource their web development and hosting entirely although many 
large firms have recently changed and brought the entire web effort in-house. (see the 
closing case study, Dick’s Sporting Goods: Taking Control of Its E-commerce Operations).
While how much you spend to build a website depends on how much you can 
afford, and, of course, the size of the opportunity, Figure 4.3 provides some idea of 
the relative size of various website costs. In general, the cost of hardware, software, and 
telecommunications for building and operating a website has fallen dramatically (by 
over 50%) in the last decade, making it possible for very small entrepreneurs to build 
fairly sophisticated sites. At the same time, while technology has lowered the costs of 
system development, the costs of marketing, content development, and design have

risen to make up more than half of typical website budgets. The longer-term costs 
would also have to include site and system maintenance, which are not included here. 
The costs of developing a mobile site and apps are discussed in Section 4.6.

BUILDING AN E-COMMERCE PRESENCE: A 
SYSTEMATIC APPROACH
Once you have developed a vision of the e-commerce presence you want to build, it’s 
time to start thinking about how to build and implement that presence. Building a suc-
cessful e-commerce presence requires a keen understanding of business, technology, 
and social issues, as well as a systematic approach. E-commerce is just too important 
to be left totally to technologists and programmers.
The two most important management challenges are (1) developing a clear under-
standing of your business objectives and (2) knowing how to choose the right technology 
to achieve those objectives. The first challenge requires you to build a plan for develop-
ing your firm’s presence. The second challenge requires you to understand some of the 
basic elements of e-commerce infrastructure. Let the business drive the technology.
Even if you decide to outsource the development effort and operation to a service 
provider, you will still need to have a development plan and some understanding of 
the basic e-commerce infrastructure issues such as cost, capability, and constraints. 
Without a plan and a knowledge base, you will not be able to make sound management 
decisions about e-commerce within your firm.
Let’s assume you are a manager for a medium-sized industrial parts firm in the 
United States. You have been given a budget of $100,000 to develop an e-commerce 
presence for the firm. The purpose will be to sell and service the firm’s customers, who 
are mostly small machine and metal fabricating shops, and to engage your customers 
through the website, perhaps via a blog and user forum. Where do you start? In the 
following sections, we will examine developing an e-commerce website, and then, at 
the end of the chapter, discuss some of the more specific considerations involved in 
developing a mobile site and building mobile applications.
First, you must be aware of the main areas where you will need to make decisions 
(see Figure 4.4). On the organizational and human resources fronts, you will have 
to bring together a team of individuals who possess the skill sets needed to build and 
manage a successful e-commerce presence. This team will make the key decisions 
about business objectives and strategy, technology, design, and social and information 
policies. The entire development effort must be closely managed if you hope to avoid 
the disasters that have occurred at some firms.
You will also need to make decisions about hardware, software, and telecommu-
nications infrastructure. The demands of your customers should drive your choices of 
technology. Your customers will want technology that enables them to find what they 
want easily, view the product, purchase the product, and then receive the product 
from your warehouses quickly. You will also have to carefully consider design. Once 
you have identified the key decision areas, you will need to think about a plan for 
the project.

PLANNING: THE SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
Your second step in building an e-commerce website will be creating a plan document. 
In order to tackle a complex problem such as building an e-commerce site, you will 
have to proceed systematically through a series of steps. One methodology is the 
systems development life cycle. The systems development life cycle (SDLC) is a 
methodology for understanding the business objectives of any system and designing 
an appropriate solution. Adopting a life cycle methodology does not guarantee success, 
but it is far better than having no plan at all. The SDLC method also helps in creating 
documents that communicate objectives, important milestones, and the uses of 
resources to management. Figure 4.5 illustrates the five major steps involved in the 
systems development life cycle for an e-commerce site:
•	 Systems analysis/planning
•	 Systems design
•	 Building the system
•	 Testing
•	 Implementation
SYSTEMS ANALYSIS/PLANNING: IDENTIFY BUSINESS OBJECTIVES, 
SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY, AND INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS
In the systems analysis/planning step of the SDLC, you try to answer the question, 
“What do we want this e-commerce site to do for our business?” The key point is to let 
the business decisions drive the technology, not the reverse. This will ensure that your 
technology platform is aligned with your business. We will assume here that you have 
identified a business strategy and chosen a business model to achieve your strategic 
objectives (see Chapter 2). But how do you translate your strategies, business models, 
and ideas into a working e-commerce website?

One way to start is to identify the specific business objectives for your site, and 
then develop a list of system functionalities and information requirements. Business 
objectives are simply capabilities you want your site to have.
System functionalities are types of information systems capabilities you will 
need to achieve your business objectives. The information requirements for a 
system are the information elements that the system must produce in order to achieve 
the business objectives. You will need to provide these lists to system developers and 
programmers so they know what you as the manager expect them to do.
Table 4.2 describes some basic business objectives, system functionalities, and 
information requirements for a typical e-commerce site. As shown in the table, there 
are ten basic business objectives that an e-commerce site must deliver. These objec-
tives must be translated into a description of system functionalities and ultimately 
into a set of precise information requirements. The specific information requirements 
for a system typically are defined in much greater detail than Table 4.2 indicates. To a 
large extent, the business objectives of an e-commerce site are not that different from 
those of an ordinary retail store. The real difference lies in the system functionalities 
and information requirements. In an e-commerce site, the business objectives must 
be provided entirely in digital form without buildings or salespeople, 24 hours a day, 
7 days a week.
SYSTEM DESIGN: HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PLATFORMS
Once you have identified the business objectives and system functionalities, and have 
developed a list of precise information requirements, you can begin to consider just 
how all this functionality will be delivered. You must come up with a system design 
specification—a description of the main components in the system and their relation-
ship to one another. The system design itself can be broken down into two 
business objectives
capabilities you want your 
site to have
system functionalities
types of information 
systems capabilities you 
will need to achieve your 
business objectives

requirements
the information elements 
that the system must

components: a logical design and a physical design. A logical design includes a data 
flow diagram that describes the flow of information at your e-commerce site, the 
processing functions that must be performed, and the databases that will be used. The 
logical design also includes a description of the security and emergency backup pro-
cedures that will be instituted, and the controls that will be used in the system.
A physical design translates the logical design into physical components. For 
instance, the physical design details the specific model of server to be purchased, the 
software to be used, the size of the telecommunications link that will be required, the 
way the system will be backed up and protected from outsiders, and so on.
Figure 4.6(a) presents a data flow diagram for a simple high-level logical design 
for a very basic website that delivers catalog pages in HTML in response to HTTP 
requests from the client’s browser, while Figure 4.6(b) shows the corresponding 
physical design. Each of the main processes can be broken down into lower-level 
designs that are much more precise in identifying exactly how the information flows 
and what equipment is involved.
BUILDING THE SYSTEM: IN-HOUSE VERSUS OUTSOURCING
Now that you have a clear idea of both the logical and physical designs for your site, 
you can begin considering how to actually build the site. You have many choices, and 
logical design
describes the flow of 
information at your 
e-commerce site, the 
processing functions that 
must be performed, the 
databases that will be

dures that will be insti-
tuted, and the controls that 
will be used in the system

CHOICES IN BUILDING AND HOSTING
You have a number of alternatives to consider when building and hosting an e-commerce site.
much depends on the amount of money you are willing to spend. Choices range from 
outsourcing everything (including the actual systems analysis and design) to building 
everything yourself (in-house). Outsourcing means that you will hire an outside 
vendor to provide the services involved in building the site rather than using in-house 
personnel. You also have a second decision to make: will you host (operate) the site 
on your firm’s own servers or will you outsource the hosting to a web host provider? 
These decisions are independent of each other, but they are usually considered at the 
same time. There are some vendors who will design, build, and host your site, while 
others will either build or host (but not both). Figure 4.7 illustrates the alternatives.
Build Your Own versus Outsourcing
Let’s take the building decision first. If you elect to build your own site, there are a 
range of options. Unless you are fairly skilled, you should use a pre-built template to 
create the website. For example, Yahoo Aabaco Small Business (formerly Yahoo Stores) 
provides templates that merely require you to input text, graphics, and other data, 
as well as the infrastructure to run a sales-oriented website once it has been created.
If your website is not a sales-oriented site requiring a shopping cart, one of the 
least expensive and most widely used site building tools is WordPress. WordPress is 
a website development tool with a sophisticated content management system. A 
content management system (CMS) is a database software program specifically 
designed to manage structured and unstructured data and objects in a website environ-
ment. A CMS provides web managers and designers with a centralized control struc-
ture to manage website content. WordPress also has thousands of user-built plug-ins 
and widgets that you can use to extend the functionality of a website. Websites built 
in WordPress are treated by search engines like any other website: their content is 
indexed and made available to the entire web community. Revenue-generating ads, 
affiliates, and sponsors are the main sources of revenue for WordPress sites. Other

similar website building tools are provided by Google Sites, Wix, Squarespace, and 
Weebly. While these are the least costly ways to create a website, you will be limited 
to the “look and feel” and functionality provided by the templates and infrastructure 
supplied by these vendors.
If you have some programming experience, you might decide to build the site 
yourself “from scratch.” There are a broad variety of tools, ranging from those that 
help you build everything truly “from scratch,” such as Adobe Dreamweaver CC and 
Microsoft Visual Studio, to top-of-the-line prepackaged site-building tools that can 
create sophisticated sites customized to your needs. Figure 4.8 illustrates the spec-
trum of tools available. We will look more closely at the variety of e-commerce software 
available in Section 4.3.
The decision to build a website on your own has a number of risks. Given the 
complexity of features such as shopping carts, credit card authentication and process-
ing, inventory management, and order processing, the costs involved are high, as are 
the risks of doing a poor job. You will be reinventing what other specialized firms 
have already built, and your staff may face a long, difficult learning curve, delaying 
your entry to market. Your efforts could fail. On the positive side, you may be better 
able to build a site that does exactly what you want, and, more importantly, develop 
the in-house knowledge to allow you to change the site rapidly if necessary due to a 
changing business environment.
If you choose more expensive site-building packages, you will be purchasing 
state-of-the art software that is well tested. You could get to market sooner. However, 
to make a sound decision, you will have to evaluate many different packages, and this 
can take a long time. You may have to modify the package to fit your business needs 
and perhaps hire additional outside vendors to do the modifications. Costs rise rapidly 
as modifications mount. A $4,000 package can easily become a $40,000 to $60,000 
development project (see Figure 4.9).

In the past, bricks-and-mortar retailers in need of an e-commerce site typically 
designed the site themselves (because they already had the skilled staff in place and 
had extensive investments in information technology capital such as databases and 
telecommunications). However, as web applications have become more sophisticated, 
larger retailers today rely heavily on vendors to provide sophisticated website capabili-
ties, while also maintaining a substantial internal staff. Small startups may build their 
own sites from scratch using in-house technical personnel in an effort to keep costs 
low. Medium-size startups will often purchase a website design and programming 
expertise from vendors. Very small mom-and-pop firms seeking simple storefronts 
will use templates like WordPress. For e-commerce sites, the cost of building has 
dropped dramatically in the last five years, resulting in lower capital requirements for 
all players (see Insight on Business: Weebly Makes Building Websites Easy).
Host Your Own versus Outsourcing
Now let’s look at the hosting decision. Most businesses choose to outsource hosting and 
pay a company to host their website, which means that the hosting company is respon-
sible for ensuring the site is “live,” or accessible, 24 hours a day. By agreeing to a monthly 
fee, the business need not concern itself with many of the technical aspects of setting 
up a web server and maintaining it, telecommunications links, nor with staffing needs.
You can also choose to co-locate. With a co-location agreement, your firm pur-
chases or leases a web server (and has total control over its operation) but locates the 
server in a vendor’s physical facility. The vendor maintains the facility, communica-
tions lines, and the machinery. Co-location has expanded with the spread of virtualiza-
tion where one server has multiple processors (4 to 16) and can operate multiple 
websites at once with multiple operating systems. In this case, you do not buy the 
co-location
when a firm purchases or 
leases a web server (and 
has total control over its 
operation) but locates the 
server in a vendor’s phys-
ical facility. The vendor 
maintains the facility, 
communications lines, and 
the machinery
While sophisticated site development software packages appear to reduce costs and increase speed to 
market, as the modifications required to fit the package to your business needs rise, costs rise rapidly.

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
WEEBLY MAKES CREATING WEBSITES EASY
With so many big companies domi-
nating the e-commerce scene, you 
may wonder if there’s a chance for 
the little guy anymore. The answer is 
yes: there are still billions left in poten-
tial online retail sales, with additional 
money to be made from advertising revenues. In 
fact, there’s an e-commerce frenzy going on that 
nearly rivals the dot-com era with one exception: 
the startups have access to cheap technology and 
social media that can provide inexpensive market-
ing and sales.
Weebly provides valuable website solutions 
for smaller businesses and entrepreneurs. Founded 
in 2007 by Penn State graduates David Rusenko, 
Chris Fanini, and Dan Veltri, Weebly provides tem-
plates that allow small businesses to create their 
own websites with a full suite of features, includ-
ing blogs, online stores, and mobile compatibility. 
Weebly’s customers have built 40 million sites, 
which together have 300 million monthly unique 
visitors. Users create sites using a drag-and- 
drop, widget-based tool that works within a web 
browser. Weebly’s typical customers are the “little 
guys” without website coding experience, and who 
are hoping to harness the site tools traditionally 
available only to bigger websites and retailers.
Weebly is just one option in an increasingly 
crowded marketplace for website creation ser-
vices. Today’s offerings are a far cry from early 
services like GeoCities and Angelfire, which look 
crude by today’s standards. Weebly and its com-
petitors, including Squarespace, Wix, and Word-
Press, offer a much more polished product than 
their predecessors. The company has a free option 
with basic features as well as premium plans 
starting at $6 per month and increasing to only 
$18.75 per month for its high-end Business plan. 
Over the course of its growth, Weebly has added 
Google AdSense monetization features, CSS/ 
HTML editing support, and the ability to generate 
a mobile version of each website automatically. 
Weebly is a strong player in this marketplace, 
boasting 40 million registered users, though it 
does not disclose how many are paid subscrib-
ers. By contrast, Wix has 82 million registered 
users, but less than 2 million of those are paid 
subscribers.
Weebly has increasingly focused on improving 
its e-commerce services, such as a mobile store 
and checkout capability, integrated shopping cart, 
and filtered product search. It also offers basic 
support for PayPal, Google Checkout, and Square. 
By revamping its e-commerce tools, Weebly hopes 
to better compete with Amazon, as well as similar 
user-friendly marketplaces such as Etsy and 
Shopify. Sixty percent of Weebly users identify 
themselves as entrepreneurs hoping to create an 
online presence for their business.
The inventors of the Dharma Yoga Wheel, Dov 
Vargas and Raquel Vamos, fit this description. The 
two yoga instructors developed the wheel, which 
helps new yoga practitioners learn to improve the 
flexibility of their back, chest, shoulders, abdomen, 
and hip flexors, release tension in those areas, and 
perform other exercises, in 2014. After launch-
ing their site, their sales grew to over $1 million 
within a year. Wheels are hand-made in the United 
States, and start from approximately $80, with 
options of both environmentally-friendly plastic 
and wooden wheels. The Dharma Yoga Wheel store 
also offers yoga apparel and other equipment like 
handstand canes and yoga straps. The two found-
ers credit Weebly with the ability to reach Canada, 
Europe, Asia, and other markets that would have 
been unreachable without a website.
Although Weebly doesn’t disclose its revenue, 
the company is profitable and has been since

2009. This is an attractive quality for a 
startup company, many of which have histori-
cally sought growth first and profitability later. 
In 2014, Weebly received $35 million in venture 
capital funding that valued the company at $455 
million. As of 2016, the founders have yet to spend 
the money, though they expect to use it to drive 
future growth. The company’s hiring of a former 
Google executive to serve as chief financial officer 
suggests it plans to begin using its venture capital 
actively. Weebly is one of the more valuable com-
panies to graduate from the technology incubator 
Y Combinator (featured in the Insight on Business 
case in Chapter 1), which its founders attended 
in 2007.
Because so many businesses still don’t have 
an online presence, Weebly’s prospects for growth 
are bright. Less than 40% of restaurants have 
online menus, for example. Although its competi-
tors are also growing fast, there appears to be 
enough room in this market for several companies. 
In 2013, Wix launched an initial public offering, 
but the response was lukewarm, with investors 
expressing concern over its lack of profitability. 
So far, that’s an advantage for Weebly, but when 
Weebly begins an aggressive push for growth, the 
company’s profitability may suffer.
Weebly has continued adapting its platform. 
In September 2016, it released Weebly 4, the 
fourth generation of its website creation platform, 
focusing on integrating website design with e-com-
merce functionality specifically aimed at small and 
medium-sized businesses, together with marketing 
solutions such as an easy-to-use e-mail marketing 
module. For example, sites can now incorporate 
abandoned cart functionality, which allows stores 
to message customers when they leave the site 
without completing a purchase, as well as func-
tionality that allows stores to more easily calcu-
late taxes and real-time shipping prices. Targeted 
e-mail campaigns, such as to customers who have 
not purchased an item within a specified time 
period, can be easily implemented. Weebly hopes 
the new platform will enable it to better compete 
with other e-commerce platform providers, such 
as Shopify, as well as its traditional website cre-
ation competitors. The new features, which are 
also available for mobile devices, build on the 
functionality of Carbon, Weebly’s third generation 
platform. Weebly launched Carbon, which neces-
sitated a complete rebuild of its platform, in 2015. 
Carbon focused on mobile development, providing 
users with new mobile apps for iPhone, iPad, and 
Android that allow users to update their sites on 
the go. Carbon also included an App Center, which 
allows customers to quickly and easily choose from 
over 40 partner apps to improve their sites, as well 
as a Dashboard that gives customers a detailed 
analytical view of their business. 
Weebly is just one example of a larger trend 
toward leaner business models that rely on outside 
help for many business functions. Although hard-
ware has become less expensive over time, many 
startup firms have found that cloud computing 
and social marketing greatly reduce the costs of 
starting a company. Market intelligence, public 
relations, and even design services can be found 
online for a fraction of the cost of traditional 
service firms. It’s never been cheaper to start an 
e-commerce company.

server but rent its capabilities on a monthly basis, usually at one-quarter of the cost 
of owning the server itself. See Table 4.3 for a list of some of the major hosting/co-
location/cloud providers. There is an extraordinary range of prices for co-location, 
ranging from $4.95 a month, to several hundred thousands of dollars per month 
depending on the size of the website, bandwidth, storage, and support 
requirements.
While co-location involves renting physical space for your hardware, you can 
think of using a cloud service provider as renting virtual space in your provider’s 
infrastructure. Cloud services are rapidly replacing co-location because they are less 
expensive, and arguably more reliable. Unlike with co-location, your firm does not own 
the hardware. Cloud service providers offer a standardized infrastructure, virtualization 
technology, and employ a pay-as-you-go billing system. 
Hosting, co-location, and cloud services have become a commodity and a utility: 
costs are driven by very large providers (such as IBM) who can achieve large econo-
mies of scale by establishing huge “server farms” located strategically around the 
country and the globe. This means the cost of pure hosting has fallen as fast as the 
fall in server prices, dropping about 50% every year! Telecommunications costs 
have also fallen. As a result, most hosting services seek to differentiate themselves 
from the commodity hosting business by offering extensive site design, marketing, 
optimization, and other services. Small, local ISPs also can be used as hosts, but 
service reliability is an issue. Will the small ISPs be able to provide uninterrupted 
service, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year? Will they have service staff 
available when you need it?
There are several disadvantages to outsourcing hosting. If you choose a vendor, 
make sure the vendor has the capability to grow with you. You need to know what 
kinds of security provisions are in place for backup copies of your site, internal moni-
toring of activity, and security track record. Is there a public record of a security breach 
at the vendor? Most Fortune 500 firms have their own private cloud data centers so 
they can control the web environment. On the other hand, there are risks to hosting 
your own site if you are a small business. Your costs will be higher than if you had used 
a large outsourcing firm because you don’t have the market power to obtain low-cost 
hardware and telecommunications. You will have to purchase hardware and software, 
have a physical facility, lease communications lines, hire a staff, and build security 
and backup capabilities yourself.

TESTING THE SYSTEM
Once the system has been built and programmed, you will have to engage in a testing 
process. Depending on the size of the system, this could be fairly difficult and lengthy. 
Testing is required whether the system is outsourced or built in-house. A complex 
e-commerce site can have thousands of pathways through the site, each of which must 
be documented and then tested. It is important to note that testing is generally under-
budgeted. As much as 50% of the budget can be consumed by testing and rebuilding 
(usually depending on the quality of the initial design). Unit testing involves testing 
the site’s program modules one at a time. System testing involves testing the site as 
a whole, in the same way a typical user would when using the site. Because there is 
no truly “typical” user, system testing requires that every conceivable path be tested. 
Final acceptance testing requires that the firm’s key personnel and managers in 
marketing, production, sales, and general management actually use the system as 
installed on a test Internet or intranet server. This acceptance test verifies that the 
business objectives of the system as originally conceived are in fact working. 
Another form of testing is called A/B testing (or split testing). This form of testing 
involves showing two versions (A and B) of a web page or website to different users to 
see which one performs better. There are several different types of A/B testing that can 
be used for a website design project. A template test compares the same general page 
content using two different layouts and or design treatments. A new concept test com-
pares a control page with one that is very different. A funnel test compares the flow 
through a series of pages (such as a product page, to a registration page, to shopping cart 
page, versus skipping the registration page) to see which one results in a higher percent-
age of conversions. Multivariate testing is a much more sophisticated form of testing 
than A/B testing. Multivariate testing involves identifying specific elements, or variables, 
on a web page, such as a headline, image, button and text, creating versions for each 
element, and then creating a unique combination of each element and version to test. 
So for example, if there are three elements and two versions of each, there will be eight 
possible combinations (2*2*2 = 8) to test. When used correctly, multivariate testing 
enables designers to identify the most optimal layout, color, content and format. 
IMPLEMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE
Most people unfamiliar with systems erroneously think that once an information 
system is installed, the process is over. In fact, while the beginning of the process 
is over, the operational life of a system is just beginning. Systems break down for a 
variety of reasons—most of them unpredictable. Therefore, they need continual check-
ing, testing, and repair. Systems maintenance is vital, but sometimes not budgeted for. 
In general, the annual system maintenance cost will roughly parallel the development 
cost. A $40,000 e-commerce site will likely require a $40,000 annual expenditure to 
maintain. Very large e-commerce sites experience some economies of scale, so that, 
for example, a $1 million site will likely require a maintenance budget of $500,000 to 
$700,000.
Why does it cost so much to maintain an e-commerce site? Unlike payroll systems, 
for example, e-commerce sites are always in a process of change, improvement, and 
correction. Studies of traditional systems maintenance have found 20% of the time

is devoted to debugging code and responding to emergency situations (for example, 
a new server was installed by your ISP, and all your hypertext links were lost and 
CGI scripts disabled—the site is down!). Another 20% of the time is concerned with 
changes in reports, data files, and links to backend databases. The remaining 60% of 
maintenance time is devoted to general administration (making product and price 
changes in the catalog) and making changes and enhancements to the system. E-com-
merce sites are never finished: they are always in the process of being built and rebuilt. 
They are dynamic—much more so than payroll systems.
The long-term success of an e-commerce site will depend on a dedicated team of 
employees (the web team) whose sole job is to monitor and adapt the site to changing 
market conditions. The web team must be multi-skilled; it will typically include program-
mers, designers, and business managers drawn from marketing, production, and sales 
support. One of the first tasks of the web team is to listen to customers’ feedback on the 
site and respond to that feedback as necessary. A second task is to develop a systematic 
monitoring and testing plan to be followed weekly to ensure all the links are operating, 
prices are correct, and pages are updated. A large business may have thousands of web 
pages, many of them linked, that require systematic monitoring. Other important tasks 
of the web team include benchmarking (a process in which the site is compared with 
those of competitors in terms of response speed, quality of layout, and design) and 
keeping the site current on pricing and promotions. The Web is a competitive environ-
ment where you can very rapidly frustrate and lose customers with a dysfunctional site.
FACTORS IN OPTIMIZING WEBSITE PERFORMANCE
If you are a small firm using one of the available design and hosting sites like Word-
Press, you do not have to worry about hardware, software, and website optimizing 
techniques because the vendor will provide this expertise. However, if you are develop-
ing your firm’s website in-house, you will need to consider these issues. The purpose 
of a website is to deliver content to customers and to complete transactions. The faster 
and more reliably these two objectives are met, the more effective the website is from 
a commerce perspective. If you are a manager or marketing executive, you will want 
the website operating in a way that fulfills customers’ expectations. You’ll have to make 
sure the website is optimized to achieve this business objective. The optimization of 
website performance is more complicated than it seems and involves at least three 
factors: page content, page generation, and page delivery (see Figure 4.10). In this 
chapter, we describe the software and hardware choices you will need to make in 
building an e-commerce site; these are also important factors in website optimization.
Using efficient styles and techniques for page design and content can reduce response 
times by two to five seconds. Simple steps include reducing unnecessary HTML com-
ments and white space, using more efficient graphics, and avoiding unnecessary links to 
other pages in the site. Page generation speed can be enhanced by segregating computer 
servers to perform dedicated functions (such as static page generation, application 
logic, media servers, and database servers), and using various devices from vendors to 
speed up these servers. Using a single server or multiple servers to perform multiple 
tasks reduces throughput by more than 50%. Page delivery can be speeded up by using 
specialized content delivery networks such as Akamai, or by increasing local bandwidth.

We will discuss some of these factors throughout the chapter, but a full discussion of 
optimizing website performance is beyond the scope of this text.

CHOOSING SOFTWARE
Along with telecommunications, software and hardware constitute the infrastructure of 
an e-commerce presence. As a business manager in charge of creating an e-commerce 
presence, you will need to know some basic information about both.
SIMPLE VERSUS MULTI-TIERED WEBSITE ARCHITECTURE
Prior to the development of e-commerce, websites simply delivered web pages to users 
who were making requests through their browsers for HTML pages with content of 
various sorts. Website software was appropriately quite simple—it consisted of a server 
computer running basic web server software. We might call this arrangement a single-
tier system architecture. System architecture refers to the arrangement of software, 
machinery, and tasks in an information system needed to achieve a specific functional-
ity (much like a home’s architecture refers to the arrangement of building materials 
to achieve a particular functionality). Many websites started this way—there are no 
monetary transactions. Tens of thousands of sites still perform this way. Orders can 
always be called in by telephone and not taken online.
However, the development of e-commerce required a great deal more interactive 
functionality, such as the ability to respond to user input (name and address forms), 
take customer orders for goods and services, clear credit card transactions on the fly, 
consult price and product databases, and even adjust advertising on the screen based 
on user characteristics. This kind of extended functionality required the develop-
ment of web application servers and a multi-tiered system architecture to handle the 
processing loads. Web application servers, described more fully later in this section, are

specialized software programs that perform a wide variety of transaction processing 
required by e-commerce.
In addition to having specialized application servers, e-commerce sites must be 
able to pull information from and add information to pre-existing corporate databases. 
These older databases that predate the e-commerce era are called backend or legacy 
databases. Corporations have made massive investments in these systems to store 
their information on customers, products, employees, and vendors. These backend 
systems constitute an additional layer in a multi-tiered site.

merce site architecture. In two-tier architecture, a web server responds to requests 
In a multi-tier architecture, a web server is linked to a middle-tier layer that typically includes a series 
of application servers that perform specific tasks, as well as to a backend layer of existing corporate 
systems.

provides backend data storage.

for web pages and a database server provides backend data storage. In a multi-tier 
architecture, in contrast, the web server is linked to a middle-tier layer that typically 
includes a series of application servers that perform specific tasks, as well as to a 
backend layer of existing corporate systems containing product, customer, and pricing 
information. A multi-tiered site typically employs several physical computers, each 
running some of the software applications and sharing the workload across many 
physical computers.
The remainder of this section describes basic web server software functionality 
and the various types of web application servers.
WEB SERVER SOFTWARE
All e-commerce sites require basic web server software to answer requests from cus-
tomers for HTML and XML pages.
When you choose web server software, you will also be choosing an operating 
system for your site’s computers. Apache, which works with Linux and Unix operat-
ing systems, is the leading web server software (Netcraft, 2016). Unix is the original 
programming language of the Internet and Web, and Linux is a derivative of Unix 
designed for the personal computer. Apache was developed by a worldwide commu-
nity of Internet innovators. Apache is free and can be downloaded from many sites 
on the Web; it also comes installed on most IBM web servers. Literally thousands of 
programmers have worked on Apache over the years; thus, it is extremely stable. There 
are thousands of utility software programs written for Apache that can provide all the 
functionality required for a contemporary e-commerce site. In order to use Apache, 
you will need staff that is knowledgeable in Unix or Linux.
Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) is another popular type of web server 
software. IIS is based on the Windows operating system and is compatible with a wide 
selection of Microsoft utility and support programs. 
There are also at least 100 other smaller providers or open source versions of web 
server software. Note that the choice of web server has little effect on users of your 
system. The pages they see will look the same regardless of the development environ-
ment. There are many advantages to the Microsoft suite of development tools—they 
are integrated, powerful, and easy to use. The Unix operating system, on the other 
hand, is exceptionally reliable and stable, and there is a worldwide open software 
community that develops and tests Unix-based web server software.
Table 4.4 shows the basic functionality provided by all web servers.
Site Management Tools
In Chapter 3, we described most of the basic functionality of the web servers listed in 
Table 4.4. Another functionality not described previously is site management tools. 
Site management tools are essential if you want to keep your site working, and if 
you want to understand how well it is working. Site management tools verify that links 
on pages are still valid and also identify orphan files, or files on the site that are not 
linked to any pages. By surveying the links on a website, a site management tool can 
quickly report on potential problems and errors that users may encounter. Your

customers will not be impressed if they encounter a “404 Error: Page Does Not Exist” 
message on your website. Links to URLs that have moved or been deleted are called 
dead links; these can cause error messages for users trying to access that link. Regu-
larly checking that all links on a site are operational helps prevent irritation and 
frustration in users who may decide to take their business elsewhere to a better func-
tioning site.
Even more importantly, site management tools can help you understand con-
sumer behavior on your website. Site management software and services, such as 
those provided by Webtrends, can be purchased in order to more effectively monitor 
customer purchases and marketing campaign effectiveness, as well as keep track of 
standard hit counts and page visit information. These services can track your e-com-
merce presence on the Web, mobile, and social network platforms. Figure 4.12 shows 
a screenshot that illustrates Webtrends Analytics 10.
Dynamic Page Generation Tools
One of the most important innovations in website operation has been the develop-
ment of dynamic page generation tools. Prior to the development of e-commerce, 
websites primarily delivered unchanging static content in the form of HTML pages. 
While this capability might be sufficient to display pictures of products, consider all 
the elements of a typical e-commerce site today by reviewing Table 4.2 (on page 200), 
or visit what you believe is an excellent e-commerce site. The content of successful 
e-commerce sites is always changing, often day by day. There are new products and 
promotions, changing prices, news events, and stories of successful users. E-commerce 
sites must intensively interact with users who not only request pages but also request 
product, price, availability, and inventory information. One of the most dynamic 
sites is eBay—the auction site. There, the content is changing minute by minute. 
E-commerce sites are just like real markets—they are dynamic. News sites, where 
stories change constantly, also are dynamic.

The dynamic and complex nature of e-commerce sites requires a number of 
specialized software applications in addition to static HTML pages. Perhaps one of the 
most important is dynamic page generation software. With dynamic page genera-
tion, the contents of a web page are stored as objects in a database, rather than being 
hard-coded in HTML. When the user requests a web page, the contents for that page 
are then fetched from the database. The objects are retrieved from the database using 
Common Gateway Interface (CGI), Active Server Pages (ASP), Java Server Pages (JSP), 
or other server-side programs. CGI, ASP, and JSP are described in the last section of 
this chapter. This technique is much more efficient than working directly in HTML 
code. It is much easier to change the contents of a database than it is to change the 
coding of an HTML page. A standard data access method called Open Database Con-
nectivity (ODBC) makes it possible for applications written in the C programming

are stored as objects in a 
database, rather than being

WEBTRENDS ANALYTICS

language to access data from any database regardless of the database and operating 
system software being used via an ODBC driver that serves as a translator between 
the application and the database. ODBC drivers are available for most of the major 
database management systems offered by companies such as Oracle, SAP, Sybase, and 
IBM. Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is a version of ODBC that provides connectiv-
ity between applications written in the Java programming language and a wide range 
of databases. However, while ODBC remains the de facto standard for cross-platform 
data access, today many web development platforms provide functionality that allows 
a programmer to directly link to a target database, making ODBC/JDBC drivers 
unnecessary. 
Dynamic page generation gives e-commerce several significant capabilities that 
generate cost and profitability advantages over traditional commerce. Dynamic page 
generation lowers menu costs (the costs incurred by merchants for changing product 
descriptions and prices). Dynamic page generation also permits easy online market 
segmentation—the ability to sell the same product to different markets. For instance, 
you might want variations on the same banner ad depending on how many times 
the customer has seen the ad. In the first exposure to a car ad, you might want to 
emphasize brand identification and unique features. On the second viewing you might 
want to emphasize superlatives like “most family friendly” to encourage comparison 
to other brands. The same capability makes possible nearly cost-free price discrimina-
tion—the ability to sell the same product to different customers at different prices. For 
instance, you might want to sell the same product to corporations and government 
agencies but use different marketing themes. Based on a cookie you place on client 
computers, or in response to a question on your site that asks visitors if they are from 
a government agency or a corporation, you would be able to use different marketing 
and promotional materials for corporate clients and government clients. You might 
want to reward loyal customers with lower prices, say on DVDs or musical tracks, and 
charge full price to first-time buyers. Dynamic page generation allows you to approach 
different customers with different messages and prices.
Dynamic page generation also enables the use of a content management system 
(CMS). As previously described, a CMS is used to create and manage web content. 
A CMS separates the design and presentation of content (such as HTML documents, 
images, video, audio) from the content creation process. The content is maintained in 
a database and dynamically linked to the website. A CMS usually includes templates 
that can be automatically applied to new and existing content, WYSIWYG editing 
tools that make it easy to edit and describe (tag) content, and collaboration, workflow, 
and document management tools. Typically, an experienced programmer is needed 
to install the system, but thereafter, content can be created and managed by non-
technical staff. There are a wide range of commercial CMSs available, from top-end 
enterprise systems offered by OpenText, IBM, Adobe, and Oracle, to mid-market 
systems by Sitecore, PaperThin, and Episerver, as well as hosted software as a service 
(SaaS) versions by Acquia, Clickability (Upland), and Crownpeak Technology among 
others. There are also several open source content management systems available, 
such as WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, OpenCms, and others.

APPLICATION SERVERS
Web application servers are software programs that provide the specific business 
functionality required of a website. The basic idea of application servers is to isolate 
the business applications from the details of displaying web pages to users on the front 
end and the details of connecting to databases on the back end. Application servers 
are a kind of middleware software that provides the glue connecting traditional cor-
porate systems to the customer as well as all the functionality needed to conduct 
e-commerce. In the early years, a number of software firms developed specific sepa-
rate programs for each function, but increasingly, these specific programs are being 
replaced by integrated software tools that combine all the needed functionality for an 
e-commerce site into a single development environment, a packaged software 
approach.
Table 4.5 illustrates the wide variety of application servers available in the mar-
ketplace. The table focuses on “sell-side” servers that are designed to enable selling 
products on the Web. So-called “buy-side” and “link” servers focus on the needs of 
businesses to connect with partners in their supply chains or find suppliers for spe-
cific parts and assemblies. There are several thousand software vendors that provide

application server software. For Linux and Unix environments, many of these capa-
bilities are available free on the Internet from various sites. Most businesses—faced 
with this bewildering array of choices—choose to use integrated software tools called 
merchant server software.
E-COMMERCE MERCHANT SERVER SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITY
E-commerce merchant server software provides the basic functionality needed for 
online sales, including an online catalog, order taking via an online shopping cart, and 
online credit card processing.
Online Catalog
A company that wants to sell products online must have a list, or online catalog, of 
its products, available on its website. Merchant server software typically includes a 
database capability that will allow for construction of a customized online catalog. The 
complexity and sophistication of the catalog will vary depending on the size of the 
company and its product lines. Small companies, or companies with small product 
lines, may post a simple list with text descriptions and perhaps color photos. A larger 
site might decide to add sound, animations, or videos (useful for product demonstra-
tions) to the catalog, or interactivity, such as customer service representatives available 
via instant messaging to answer questions. Today, larger firms make extensive use of 
streaming video.
Shopping Cart
Online shopping carts are much like their real-world equivalent; both allow shoppers 
to set aside desired purchases in preparation for checkout. The difference is that the 
online variety is part of a merchant server software program residing on the web 
server, and allows consumers to select merchandise, review what they have selected, 
edit their selections as necessary, and then actually make the purchase by clicking a 
button. The merchant server software automatically stores shopping cart data.
Credit Card Processing
A site’s shopping cart typically works in conjunction with credit card processing soft-
ware, which verifies the shopper’s credit card and then puts through the debit to the 
card and the credit to the company’s account at checkout. Integrated e-commerce soft-
ware suites typically supply the software for this function. Otherwise, you will have to 
make arrangements with a variety of credit card processing banks and intermediaries.

Rather than build your site from a collection of disparate software applications, it is 
easier, faster, and generally more cost-effective to purchase a merchant server soft-
ware package (also called an e-commerce software platform). Merchant server 
software offers an integrated environment that promises to provide most or all of the 
functionality and capabilities you will need to develop a sophisticated,

customer-centric site. An important element of merchant sofware packages is a built-in 
shopping cart that can display merchandise, manage orders, and clear credit card 
transactions. E-commerce software platforms come in three general ranges of price 
and functionality.
While existing firms often have the financial capital to invest in commercial mer-
chant server software, many small firms and startup firms do not. There are really 
two options here, the key factor being how much programming experience and time 
you have. One option is to utilize the e-commerce merchant services provided by 
sites that makes it easy to create an e-commerce website with customizable templates, 
such as Yahoo Aabaco Small Business, which offers a Basic plan for $29 a month and a 
1.5% transaction fee for each transaction processed through the store. An e-commerce 
template is a predesigned website that allows users to customize the look and feel of 
the site to fit their business needs and provides a standard set of functionalities. Most 
templates today contain ready-to-go site designs with built-in e-commerce functional-
ity like shopping carts, payment clearance, and site management tools. The Basic 
plan also includes a mobile storefront, search engine optimization tools, social media 
support, and a variety of other marketing tools. Many others, such as Bigcommerce, 
Homestead, Vendio, and Shopify offer similar services. 
If you have considerable, or at least some, programming background, you can 
consider open source merchant server software. Open source software is software 
developed by a community of programmers and designers, and is free to use and 
modify. Table 4.6 provides a description of some open source options. The advantage 
of using open source web building tools is that you get exactly what you want, a truly 
customized unique website. The disadvantage is that it will take several months for a 
single programmer to develop the site and get all the tools to work together seamlessly. 
How many months do you want to wait before you get to market with your ideas? 
Midrange e-commerce software platforms include IBM WebSphere Commerce 
Express Edition and Sitecore Commerce Server (formerly Microsoft Commerce Server). 
High-end enterprise solutions for large global firms are provided by IBM Websphere 
Professional and Enterprise Editions, IBM Commerce on Cloud, Oracle ATG Web Com-
merce, Salesforce Commerce Cloud (formerly Demandware), Magento, NetSuite, and 
others. Many of these e-commerce software platforms are now available on a Software 
as a Service (SaaS) basis, a model in which the software is hosted in the cloud and run 
by the client via a web browser. This model enables a firm to launch an e-commerce 
site very quickly. For instance, Williams-Sonoma, a housewares retail chain in the 
United States, used web-hosted e-commerce software from NetSuite to launch an 
e-commerce site in Australia in only 3 months time (Dusto, 2014). There are several 
hundred software firms that provide e-commerce software, which raises the costs of 
making sensible decisions on this matter. 
Choosing an E-commerce Software Platform
With all of these vendors, how do you choose the right one? Evaluating these tools 
and making a choice is one of the most important and uncertain decisions you will 
make in building an e-commerce site. The real costs are hidden—they involve training 
open source software

by a community of

your staff to use the tools and integrating the tools into your business processes and 
organizational culture. The following are some of the key factors to consider:
•	 Functionality, including availability on an SaaS basis
•	 Support for different business models, including m-commerce
•	 Business process modeling tools
•	 Visual site management tools and reporting
•	 Performance and scalability
•	 Connectivity to existing business systems
•	 Compliance with standards
•	 Global and multicultural capability
•	 Local sales tax and shipping rules
For instance, although e-commerce software platforms promise to do every-
thing, your business may require special functionality—such as streaming audio and 
video. You will need a list of business functionality requirements. Your business may 
involve several different business models—such as a retail side and a business-to-
business side; you may run auctions for stock excess as well as fixed-price selling.

Be sure the package can support all of your business models. You may wish to 
change your business processes, such as order taking and order fulfillment. Does the 
platform contain tools for modeling business process and work flows? Understand-
ing how your site works will require visual reporting tools that make its operation 
transparent to many different people in your business. A poorly designed software 
package will drop off significantly in performance as visitors and transactions expand 
into the thousands per hour, or minute. Check for performance and scalability by 
stress-testing a pilot edition or obtaining data from the vendor about performance 
under load. You will have to connect the e-commerce platform to your traditional 
business systems. How will this connection to existing systems be made, and is 
your staff skilled in making the connection? Because of the changing technical 
environment—in particular, changes in m-commerce platforms—it is important to 
document exactly what standards the platform supports now, and what the migra-
tion path will be toward the future. Finally, your e-commerce site may have to work 
both globally and locally. You may need a foreign language edition using foreign 
currency denominations. And you will have to collect sales taxes across many local, 
regional, and national tax systems. Does the e-commerce platform support this level 
of globalization and localization?
	 4.4	
CHOOSING HARDWARE
Whether you host your own site or outsource the hosting and operation of your site, 
you will need to understand certain aspects of the computing hardware platform. The 
hardware platform refers to all the underlying computing equipment that the 
system uses to achieve its e-commerce functionality. Your objective is to have enough 
platform capacity to meet peak demand (avoiding an overload condition), but not so 
much platform that you are wasting money. Failing to meet peak demand can mean 
your site is slow, or actually crashes. How much computing and telecommunications 
capacity is enough to meet peak demand? How many hits per day can your site 
sustain?
To answer these questions, you will need to understand the various factors that 
affect the speed, capacity, and scalability of an e-commerce site.
RIGHT-SIZING YOUR HARDWARE PLATFORM: THE DEMAND SIDE
The most important factor affecting the speed of your site is the demand that cus-
tomers put on the site. Table 4.7 lists the most important factors to consider when 
estimating the demand on a site.
Demand on a website is fairly complex and depends primarily on the type of site 
you are operating. The number of simultaneous users in peak periods, the nature of 
customer requests, the type of content, the required security, the number of items 
in inventory, the number of page requests, and the speed of legacy applications that 
may be needed to supply data to the web pages are all important factors in overall 
demand on a website system.

Certainly, one important factor to consider is the number of simultaneous users 
who will likely visit your site. In general, the load created by an individual customer 
on a server is typically quite limited and short-lived. A web session initiated by the 
typical user is stateless, meaning that the server does not have to maintain an ongoing, 
dedicated interaction with the client. A web session typically begins with a page 
request, then a server replies, and the session is ended. The sessions may last from 
tenths of a second to a minute per user. Nevertheless, system performance does 
degrade as more and more simultaneous users request service. Fortunately, degrada-
tion (measured as “transactions per second” and “latency” or delay in response) is

fairly graceful over a wide range, up until a peak load is reached and service quality 
becomes unacceptable (see Figure 4.13).
Serving up static web pages is I/O intensive, which means it requires input/
output (I/O) operations rather than heavy-duty processing power. As a result, website 
performance is constrained primarily by the server’s I/O limitations and the telecom-
munications connection, rather than the speed of the processor.
Other factors to consider when estimating the demand on a website are the 
user profile and the nature of the content. If users request searches, registration 
forms, and order taking via shopping carts, then demands on processors will increase 
markedly.
RIGHT-SIZING YOUR HARDWARE PLATFORM: THE SUPPLY SIDE
Once you estimate the likely demand on your site, you will need to consider how to 
scale up your site to meet demand. We have already discussed one solution that 
requires very little thought: outsource the hosting of your website to a cloud-based 
service. You can also engage the services of a content delivery network (CDN) such 
as Akamai. See Chapter 3 for a discussion of cloud-based computing services and a 
case study on Akamai. However, if you decide to host your own website, scalability is 
an important consideration. Scalability refers to the ability of a site to increase in size 
as demand warrants. There are three steps you can take to meet the demands for 
service at your site: scale hardware vertically, scale hardware horizontally, and/or 
improve the processing architecture of the site (see Table 4.8). Vertical scaling refers 
to increasing the processing power of individual components. Horizontal scaling 
refers to employing multiple computers to share the workload and increase the “foot-
print” of the installation (IBM, 2002).
You can scale your site vertically by upgrading the servers from a single processor 
to multiple processors. You can keep adding processors to a computer depending on 
the operating system and upgrade to faster chip speeds as well.

DEGRADATION IN PERFORMANCE AS NUMBER OF USERS 
INCREASES
Degradation in web server performance occurs as the number of users (connections) increases, and as the 
system’s resources (processors, disk drives) become more utilized. In (a), user-experienced delay rises 
gracefully until an inflection point is reached, and then delay rises exponentially to an unacceptable level. In 
(b), the transaction rate rises gracefully until the number of users rapidly escalates the transaction rate, and 
at a certain inflection point, the transaction rate starts declining as the system slows down or crashes.

There are two drawbacks to vertical scaling. First, it can become expensive to 
purchase additional processors with every growth cycle, and second, your entire site 
becomes dependent on a small number of very powerful computers. If you have two 
such computers and one goes down, half of your site, or perhaps your entire site, may 
become unavailable.
Horizontal scaling involves adding multiple single-processor servers to your site 
and balancing the load among the servers. You can then partition the load so some 
servers handle only requests for HTML or ASP pages, while others are dedicated to 
handling database applications. You will need special load-balancing software (provided 
by a variety of vendors such as Cisco, Microsoft, and IBM) to direct incoming requests 
to various servers.
There are many advantages to horizontal scaling. It is inexpensive and often can 
be accomplished using older PCs that otherwise would be disposed of. Horizontal 
scaling also introduces redundancy—if one computer fails, chances are that another 
computer can pick up the load dynamically. However, when your site grows from a 
single computer to perhaps 10 to 20 computers, the size of the physical facility required 
(the “footprint”) increases and there is added management complexity.
A third alternative—improving the processing architecture—is a combination of 
vertical and horizontal scaling, combined with artful design decisions. Table 4.9 lists 
some of the more common steps you can take to greatly improve performance of your 
site. Most of these steps involve splitting the workload into I/O-intensive activities 
(such as serving web pages) and CPU-intensive activities (such as taking orders). Once 
you have this work separated, you can fine-tune the servers for each type of load. One 
of the least expensive fine-tuning steps is to simply add RAM to a few servers and store 
all your HTML pages in RAM. This reduces load on your hard drives and increases 
speed dramatically. RAM is thousands of times faster than hard disks, and RAM is 
inexpensive. The next most important step is to move your CPU-intensive activities, 
such as order taking, onto a high-end, multiple-processor server that is dedicated to

you to reduce the number of servers required to service 10,000 concurrent users from 
100 down to 20, according to one estimate.

OTHER E-COMMERCE SITE TOOLS
Now that you understand the key factors affecting the speed, capacity, and scalability 
of your website, we can consider some other important requirements. You will need 
a coherent website design that makes business sense—not necessarily a site to wow 
visitors or excite them, but to sell them something. You will also need to know how 
to build active content and interactivity into your site—not just display static HTML 
pages. You must be able to track customers who come, leave, and return to your site 
in order to be able to greet return visitors (“Hi Sarah, welcome back!”). You will also 
want to track customers throughout your site so you can personalize and customize 
their experience. You will definitely want the ability for customers to generate content 
and feedback on your site to increase their engagement with your brand. Finally, you 
will need to establish a set of information policies for your site—privacy, accessibility, 
and access to information policies.
In order to achieve these business capabilities, you will need to be aware of some 
design guidelines and additional software tools that can cost-effectively achieve the 
required business functionality.
WEBSITE DESIGN: BASIC BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS
This is not a text about how to design websites. (In Chapter 6, we discuss website 
design issues from a marketing perspective.) Nevertheless, from a business manager’s 
perspective, there are certain design objectives you must communicate to your website 
designers to let them know how you will evaluate their work. At a minimum, your 
customers will need to find what they need at your site, make a purchase, and leave. A 
website that annoys customers runs the risk of losing the customer forever. See Table 
4.10 for a list of the most common consumer complaints about websites.
•	 Requiring user to view ad or intro page before 
going to website content
•	 Pop-up and pop-under ads and windows
•	 Too many clicks to get to the content
•	 Links that don’t work
•	 Confusing navigation; no search function
•	 Requirement to register and log in before 
viewing content or ordering
•	 Slow loading pages
•	 Content that is out of date
•	 Inability to use browser’s Back button
•	 No contact information available 
(web form only)
•	 Unnecessary splash/flash screens, 
animation, etc.
•	 Music or other audio that plays automatically
•	 Unprofessional design elements
•	 Text not easily legible due to size, color, format
•	 Typographical errors
•	 No or unclear returns policy

Some critics believe poor design is more common than good design. It appears 
easier to describe what irritates people about websites than to describe how to design 
a good website. The worst e-commerce sites make it difficult to find information about 
their products and make it complicated to purchase goods; they have missing pages 
and broken links, a confusing navigation structure, and annoying graphics or sounds 
that you cannot turn off. Table 4.11 restates these negative experiences as positive 
goals for website design.
TOOLS FOR SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION
A website is only as valuable from a business perspective as the number of people 
who visit. The first stop for most customers looking for a product or service is to start 
with a search engine, and follow the listings on the page, usually starting with the 
top three to five listings, then glancing to the sponsored ads to the right. The higher 
you are on the search engine pages, the more traffic you will receive. Page 1 is much 
better than Page 2. So how do you get to Page 1 in the natural (unpaid) search listings? 
While every search engine is different, and none of them publish their algorithms for 
ranking pages, there are some basic ideas that work well:
•	 Metatags, titles, page contents: Search engines “crawl” your site and identify 
keywords as well as title pages and then index them for use in search arguments. 
Pepper your pages with keywords that accurately describe what you say you do 
in your metatag site “description” and “keywords” sections of your source code. 
Experiment: use different keywords to see which work. “Vintage cars” may attract 
more visitors than “antique cars” or “restored cars.”
•	 Identify market niches: Instead of marketing “jewelry,” be more specific, such 
as “Victorian jewelry,” or “1950s jewelry” to attract small, specific groups who are 
intensely interested in period jewelry and closer to purchasing.

•	 Offer expertise: White papers, industry analyses, FAQ pages, guides, and histories 
are excellent ways to build confidence on the part of users and to encourage them 
to see your website as the place to go for help and guidance.
•	 Get linked up: Encourage other sites to link to your site; build a blog that attracts 
people and who will share your URL with others and post links in the process. Build 
a Facebook page for your company, and think about using Instagram or Pinterest 
to develop a following or fan base for your products.
•	 Buy ads: Complement your natural search optimization efforts with paid search 
engine keywords and ads. Choose your keywords and purchase direct exposure on 
web pages. You can set your budget and put a ceiling on it to prevent large losses. 
See what works, and observe the number of visits to your site produced by each 
keyword string.
•	 Local e-commerce: Developing a national market can take a long time. If your 
website is particularly attractive to local people, or involves products sold locally, 
use keywords that connote your location so people can find you nearby. Town, city, 
and region names in your keywords can be helpful, such as “Vermont cheese” or 
“San Francisco blues music.”
TOOLS FOR INTERACTIVITY AND ACTIVE CONTENT
The more interactive a website is, the more effective it will be in generating sales and 
encouraging return visitors. Although functionality and ease of use are the supreme 
objectives in site design, you will also want to interact with users and present them 
with a lively, “active” experience. You will want to personalize the experience for 
customers by addressing their individual needs, and customize the content of your 
offerings based on their behavior or expressed desires. In order to achieve these 
business objectives, you will need to consider carefully the tools necessary to build 
these capabilities. Simple interactions such as a customer submitting a name, along 
with more complex interactions involving credit cards, user preferences, and user 
responses to prompts, all require special programs. The following sections provide a 
brief description of some commonly used software tools for achieving high levels of 
site interactivity.
Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a set of standards for communication between 
a browser and a program running on a server that allows for interaction between the 
user and the server. CGI permits an executable program to access all the information 
within incoming requests from clients. The program can then generate all the output 
required to make up the return page (the HTML, script code, text, etc.), and send it 
back to the client via the web server. For instance, if a user clicks the My Shopping 
Cart button, the server receives this request and executes a CGI program. The CGI 
program retrieves the contents of the shopping cart from the database and returns it 
to the server. The server sends an HTML page that displays the contents of the shop-
ping cart on the user’s screen. Notice that all the computing takes place on the server

side (this is why CGI programs and others like it are referred to as “server-side” 
programs).
CGI programs can be written in nearly any programming language as long as 
they conform to CGI standards. Currently, Perl is one of the most popular languages 
for CGI scripting. Generally, CGI programs are used with Unix servers. CGI’s primary 
disadvantage is that it is not highly scalable because a new process must be created 
for each request, thereby limiting the number of concurrent requests that can be 
handled. CGI scripts are best used for small to medium-sized applications that do not 
involve a high volume of user traffic. There are also web server extensions available, 
such as FastCGI, that improve CGI’s scalability and SCGI, which is a simpler version 
of FastCGI (Doyle and Lopes, 2005).
CGI scripts also face security issues. In 2014, a major security hole in the com-
mand-line shell used by many Linux and Unix operating systems was discovered. 
Nicknamed Shellshock, the hole allowed hackers to target vulnerable CGI scripts on 
Apache web servers. These types of security issues have resulted in some web hosting 
services, such as Rackspace, requiring their customers to use alternatives to CGI.
Active Server Pages (ASP) and ASP.NET
Active Server Pages (ASP) is Microsoft’s original version of server-side programming 
for Windows. Invented by Microsoft in late 1996, ASP grew rapidly to become the 
major technique for server-side web programming in the Windows environment. ASP 
enables developers to easily create and open records from a database and execute 
programs within an HTML page, as well as handle all the various forms of interactivity 
found on e-commerce sites. Like CGI, ASP permits an interaction to take place between 
the browser and the server. ASP uses the same standards as CGI for communication 
with the browser. ASP programs are restricted to use on Windows servers running 
Microsoft’s IIS web server software. ASP.NET, first released in January 2002, and part 
of Microsoft’s .NET framework, is the successor to ASP. As of September 2015, ASP.NET 
4.6 is the most current version of ASP.NET. ASP.NET 5, a major rewrite aimed at provid-
ing an improved, modern, cross-platform web framework for cloud and regular applica-
tion servers, is also under development.
Java, Java Server Pages (JSP), and JavaScript
Java is a programming language that allows programmers to create interactivity and 
active content on the client computer, thereby saving considerable load on the server. 
Java was initially developed by Sun Microsystems as a platform-independent program-
ming language for consumer electronics. The idea was to create a language whose 
programs (so-called Write Once Run Anywhere [WORA] programs) could operate on 
any computer regardless of operating system. This would be possible if every operating 
system at the time (Macintosh, Windows, Unix, DOS, and mainframe MVS systems) 
had a Java Virtual Machine (VM) installed that would interpret the Java programs for 
that environment.
By 1995, however, when Sun Microsystems released Java 1.0, the first public 
version of the language, it had become clear that Java was more applicable to the 
Web than to consumer electronics. Java programs (known as Java applets) could be

downloaded to the client over the Web and executed entirely on the client’s com-
puter. Applet tags could be included in an HTML page. To enable this, each browser 
would have to include a Java VM. Today, the leading browsers include a VM to run 
Java programs and according to Oracle, which inherited oversight over Java when it 
acquired Sun Microsystems, Java is used on 97% of enterprise desktop computers. 
When the browser accesses a page with an applet, a request is sent to the server to 
download and execute the program and allocate page space to display the results 
of the program. Java can be used to display interesting graphics, create interactive 
environments (such as a mortgage calculator), and directly access the web server. 
JDK (Java Development Kit) 8 and the Java SE 8 Runtime Environment (for running 
Java applications) were released in 2014, and Java 9, which reportedly will focus on 
modularization of the platform, is expected to be released in 2016. Today, Java remains 
one of the most popular programming languages, with many critical technologies, 
such as the Google Android mobile platform (although not Apple’s iOS), leveraging 
aspects of the language. However, Java does face some challenges. In recent years, it 
has been plagued by security flaws, which Oracle has been attempting to address with 
the frequent release of new versions and security patches (Krill, 2015).
Java Server Pages (JSP), like CGI and ASP, is a web page coding standard that 
allows developers to use a combination of HTML, JSP scripts, and Java to dynamically 
generate web pages in response to user requests. JSP uses Java “servlets,” small Java 
programs that are specified in the web page and run on the web server to modify the 
web page before it is sent to the user who requested it. JSP is supported by most of 
the popular application servers on the market today.
JavaScript is a programming language invented by Netscape that is used to 
control the objects on an HTML page and handle interactions with the browser. It is 
most commonly used on the client side to handle verification and validation of user 
input, as well as to implement business logic. For instance, JavaScript can be used on 
customer registration forms to confirm that a valid phone number, zip code, or even 
e-mail address has been given. Before a user finishes completing a form, the e-mail 
address given can be tested for validity. JavaScript appears to be much more acceptable 
to corporations and other environments in large part because it is more stable and 
also it is restricted to the operation of requested HTML pages. JavaScript is also used 
as part of Node.js, a cross-platform environment for server-side applications (including 
mobile), which has been used by companies such as PayPal, Walmart, and LinkedIn. 
In 2015, Node.js v4.0 was released, combining Node.js and io.js, a variant of the Java­
Script platform built on V8, the JavaScript virtual machine used in Google Chrome, 
into a single codebase for the first time. Ajax (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) uses 
a variety of different tools, including JavaScript, to allow web pages to be updated 
asynchronously (i.e., updating only parts of the page rather than having to reload the 
entire page to change just part of the content).
ActiveX and VBScript
Microsoft invented the ActiveX programming language to compete with Java and 
VBScript to compete with JavaScript. When a browser receives an HTML page with 
an ActiveX control (comparable to a Java applet), the browser simply executes the

program. Unlike Java, however, ActiveX has full access to all the client’s resources—
printers, networks, and hard drives. VBScript performs in the same way as Java­
Script. ActiveX and VBScript work only if you are using Internet Explorer. Otherwise, 
that part of the screen is blank. However, the days of ActiveX and VBScript are 
numbered. Microsoft has dropped support for both in Microsoft Edge, the browser 
that has replaced Internet Explorer in the Windows 10 operating system. Microsoft 
believes that the need for ActiveX and VBScript has been significantly reduced given 
the capabilities of HTML5, and that eliminating them will enhance browser 
security.
ColdFusion
ColdFusion is an integrated server-side environment for developing interactive web 
and mobile applications. Originally developed by Macromedia and now offered by 
Adobe, ColdFusion combines an intuitive tag-based scripting language and a tag-based 
server scripting language (CFML) that lowers the cost of creating interactive features. 
ColdFusion offers a powerful set of visual design, programming, debugging, and 
deployment tools. The most recent version of ColdFusion, released in 2016, provides 
enhanced ability to create mobile apps, as well as a number of new security features 
and programming language enhancements, as well as increased support for 
interoperability.
PHP, Ruby on Rails (RoR), and Django
PHP is an open source, general purpose scripting language that is most frequently 
used in server-side web applications to generate dynamic web page content, although 
it can also be used for client-side graphical user interface applications. PHP is also a 
part of many web application development frameworks, such as CakePHP, CodeIgniter, 
and others, and is also part of the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) open source 
web development model for building dynamic websites and web applications (Perl 
and Python are sometimes substituted for PHP in some LAMP projects). According to 
W3Techs, PHP is, by far and away, the most commonly used server-side scripting 
language (used by over 80% of the websites whose server-side programming language 
it was able to identify), with ASP.NET a distant second, used by around 16%, followed 
by Java, with 3%. ColdFusion, Ruby on Rails, Perl, JavaScript, and Python were all 
less than 1% (W3techs.com, 2016). PHP is also popular with hackers; according to 
Netcraft, nearly all phishing kits are written in PHP (Mutton, 2015).
Ruby on Rails (RoR or Rails) is an open source web application framework 
based on the Ruby programming language. RoR is based on a philosophy known as 
convention over configuration, or coding by convention (CoC), which means that the 
framework provides a structured layout that minimizes the number of decisions that 
the programmer needs to make, thereby simplifying and speeding development. 
JavaScript and Ajax are highly integrated into RoR, which makes it easy to handle Ajax 
requests for page updates. Some well-known websites based on RoR include Shopify, 
Groupon, Indiegogo, and Airbnb (Hegde, 2015).

Django is also an open source web application framework. It is based on the 
Python programming language. Django is optimized for the creation of complex, 
database-driven websites. It allows for fast development, focuses on automating as 
much as possible, emphasizes the reusability of various components, and follows the 
DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) programming principle. Some well-known websites based 
on Django include Instagram, Pinterest, and the satirical news site, The Onion 
(Pinkham, 2015). 
Other Design Elements
One easy way to pump up the energy on your website is to include some appropriate 
widgets (sometimes called gadgets, plug-ins, or snippets). Widgets are small chunks 
of code that execute automatically in your HTML web page. They are prebuilt and 
many are free. Social networks and blogs use widgets to present users with content 
drawn from around the Web (news headlines from specific news sources, announce-
ments, press releases, and other routine content), calendars, clocks, weather, live TV, 
games, and other functionality. You can copy the code to an HTML web page. You can 
find widgets at Apple’s Dashboard Widgets, Wolfram|Alpha Widgets, and SIMILE 
Widgets. There are also widgets for specific platforms such as WordPress, Amazon 
Widgets, and Pinterest’s Widget Builder.
Mashups are a little more complicated and involve pulling functionality and data 
from one program and including it in another. The most common mashup involves 
using Google Maps data and software and combining it with other data. For instance, 
if you have a local real estate website, you can download Google Maps and satellite 
image applications to your site so visitors can get a sense of the neighborhood. There 
are thousands of Google Map mashups, from maps of Myanmar political protests, to 
maps of the Fortune 500 companies, all with associated news stories and other content. 
Other mashups involve sports, photos, video, shopping, and news.
PERSONALIZATION TOOLS
You will definitely want to know how to treat each customer on an individual basis 
and emulate a traditional face-to-face marketplace. Personalization (the ability to treat 
people based on their personal qualities and prior history with your site) and custom-
ization (the ability to change the product to better fit the needs of the customer) are 
two key elements of e-commerce that potentially can make it nearly as powerful as 
a traditional marketplace, and perhaps even more powerful than direct mail or shop-
ping at an anonymous suburban shopping mall. Speaking directly to the customer on 
a one-to-one basis, and even adjusting the product to the customer is quite difficult 
in the usual type of mass marketing, one-size-fits-all commercial transaction that 
characterizes much of contemporary commerce.
There are a number of methods for achieving personalization and customization. 
For instance, you could personalize web content if you knew the personal background 
of the visitor. You could also analyze the pattern of clicks and sites visited for every cus-
tomer who enters your site. We discuss these methods in later chapters on marketing.

The primary method for achieving personalization and customization is through the 
placement of cookie files on the user’s client computer. A cookie is a small text file 
placed on the user’s client computer that can contain any kind of information about 
the customer, such as customer ID, campaign ID, or purchases at the site. And then, 
when the user returns to the site, or indeed goes further into your site, the customer’s 
prior history can be accessed from a database. Information gathered on prior visits can 
then be used to personalize the visit and customize the product.
For instance, when a user returns to a site, you can read the cookie to find a cus-
tomer ID, look the ID up in a database of names, and greet the customer (“Hello Mary! 
Glad to have you return!”). You could also have stored a record of prior purchases, and 
then recommend a related product (“How about the wrench tool box now that you 
have purchased the wrenches?”). And you could think about customizing the product 
(“You’ve shown an interest in the elementary training programs for Word. We have 
a special ‘How to Study’ program for beginners in Office software. Would you like to 
see a sample copy online?”).
We further describe the use of cookies in Chapter 6.
THE INFORMATION POLICY SET
In developing an e-commerce site, you will also need to focus on the set of information 
policies that will govern the site. You will need to develop a privacy policy—a set of 
public statements declaring to your customers how you treat their personal informa-
tion that you gather on the site. You also will need to establish accessibility rules—a 
set of design objectives that ensure disabled users can effectively access your site. 
There are more than 50 million Americans who are disabled and require special access 
routes to buildings as well as computer systems (see Insight on Society: Designing for 
Accessibility). E-commerce information policies are described in greater depth in 
Chapter 8.

DEVELOPING A MOBILE WEBSITE AND BUILDING 
MOBILE APPLICATIONS
Today, building a website is just one part of developing an e-commerce presence. 
Given that over 90% of all Internet users access the Web at least part of the time 
from mobile devices, businesses today need to develop mobile websites, and mobile 
web apps, native apps, or hybrid apps, in order to interact with customers, suppliers, 
and employees. Deciding which of these extended web presence tools to use is a 
first step. 
There are different kinds of m-commerce platform offerings to consider, each with 
unique advantages and costs. A mobile website is a version of a regular website that 
is scaled down in content and navigation so that users can find what they want and 
move quickly to a decision or purchase. You can see the difference between a regular 
website and a mobile site by visiting the Amazon website from your desktop computer 
and then a smartphone or tablet computer. Amazon’s mobile site is a cleaner, more

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
DESIGNING FOR ACCESSIBILITY 
There are approximately 48 million 
Americans with significant hearing 
loss and 20 million with significant 
vision loss. Millions of others must 
deal with other issues that also impact 
their ability to use computers, the Internet, 
and mobile devices. As a result, the Internet and 
mobile devices are often much less accessible for 
the disabled.
Efforts to remedy this problem have taken 
several fronts. In 1998, Congress amended the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to require that elec-
tronic and information technology services provided 
by federally funded organizations must be acces-
sible to people with disabilities. However, early 
court decisions ruled that the legislation applied 
only to physical spaces, not virtual spaces. 
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 
has helped to change that. In 2006, the National 
Federation of the Blind (NFB) brought a class-
action suit against Target for failing to make its 
website accessible for the blind. After a federal 
district court ruled that the ADA did indeed apply 
to websites, Target and the NFB settled the suit, 
with Target agreeing to bring its website into com-
pliance with certain online assistive technology 
guidelines and pay damages of $6 million. In 2012, 
another federal district court ruled that websites 
can in fact be considered “public accommodation,” 
and as such fall under the jurisdiction of the ADA 
(National Association of the Deaf, et al., v. Netflix 
Inc.). For example, Netflix’s “Watch Instantly” 
feature did not provide equal access, which it must 
do as a “place of exhibition or entertainment.” In 
October 2012, Netflix settled the case, agreeing to 
caption all of its streaming videos by 2014.
Though these rulings represented break-
throughs, other rulings have suggested that the 
ADA does not apply to online-only companies 
without an actual physical location. The actions of 
the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) have failed 
to provide clarity on this critical point. In 2015, 
the DOJ signaled a shift in its policy regarding 
accessibility, stating that public accommodations 
like universities must make their websites acces-
sible, and in the case of a university, not only to 
potential students, but to all site visitors. Still, as of 
2016, the DOJ has yet to issue official regulations 
for web accessibility; the latest in a long series of 
delays pushed back the date for official regulations 
to 2018 at the earliest.
Nevertheless, rulings issued against H&R Block, 
online grocery company Peapod, and online educa-
tion company edX have required these companies to 
make their websites disability compliant. In 2016, 
a blind man from California won a case against a 
Colorado baggage retailer because of the site’s lack 
of text descriptions and forms without labels. The 
case marked the first time that a court judged in 
favor of a plaintiff before trial. The majority of the 
lawsuits alleging violations of the ADA have thus 
far targeted websites. In the near future, apps may 
become targets for this type of litigation as well.
The 21st Century Communications and Video 
Accessibility Act (CVAA), enacted in 2010, has 
also had a significant impact on accessibility. The 
CVAA requires that advanced communication 
services (ACS) must be accessible to users with 
disabilities. Covered ACS include such products and 
services as web-based e-mail, instant messaging, 
and video services such as Skype. Telecommunica-
tions companies, cellphone manufacturers, VoIP 
service providers and equipment manufacturers, 
and software companies are all impacted by the 
statute. A separate part of the statute focuses on 
the delivery of video programming, requiring that 
such programming delivered over the Internet or on 
television include close captioning.

To ensure accessibility, the FCC has 
pointed to some acceptable solutions, such as 
conforming to the World Wide Web Consortium 
(W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
(WCAG) 2.0. WCAG 2.0 provides organizations 
with strategies for accommodating people with 
many different kinds of disabilities. Such strate-
gies include providing text alternatives for any 
non-text content so that it can be changed to 
other forms; making content easier to see and 
hear; and maximizing compatibility with assis-
tive technologies, such as screen reader software. 
For instance, embedding text descriptions behind 
images allows screen readers to announce those 
descriptions. Screen readers work effectively but 
only if websites are created to ensure compatibility 
with these tools. In the absence of official DOJ 
guidelines, the WCAG standards have become the 
de facto guidelines for websites to follow, at least 
for now. In 2016, conforming closely to WCAG, 
New York City became the first major city to pass 
its own legislation standardizing accessibility for 
its governmental agency websites. Other cities are 
likely to follow suit.
Another acceptable solution identified by the 
FCC involves working with the Accessibility APIs 
developed for the operating systems of various 
devices, such as Microsoft Active Accessibility 
or Apple’s Accessibility APIs for iOS and OS X. 
Relying on third-party solutions is also accept-
able if they are readily available at a low cost. 
To help identify such solutions for the industry, 
the FCC presents annual awards for advances 
in accessibility. In 2016, winners included Unus 
Tactus, an app for people with cognitive disabilities 
that simplifies access to smartphones, and Sesame 
Enable, a project that enables users to engage 
smartphone controls with head gestures. 
The FCC does not require that every feature 
and function of every device or service be acces-
sible for every disability, but rather that there be 
solutions for different types of disabilities across a 
product line. In addition, providers can claim that 
certain accessibility solutions are not achievable—
i.e., they cannot be accomplished without unrea-
sonable effort or expense. However, major tech 
firms like Facebook are devoting unprecedented 
resources on improving their accessibility. With 
approximately 1 billion disabled people in the 
world, improving accessibility is a simple way for 
Facebook, Google, and other sites to grow their 
user base, reduce legal risk, and improve the site 
experience for a significant portion of their users. 
Facebook is developing software that can summa-
rize the content of pictures without the uploader 
adding text, and has already developed closed cap-
tioning technologies and more keyboard shortcuts. 
Still, there’s a long way to go. At least half of all 
websites lack accessibility features, and a 2015 
study found that 90% of 20 top colleges failed 
to meet accessibility standards. Even the NFB’s 
own website scored only a C+ according to soft-
ware that measures levels of ADA compliance. The 
NFB has since improved its site, but others may 
require the threat of expensive lawsuits to improve 
compliance.

interactive site suitable for finger navigation, and efficient consumer decision making. 
Like traditional websites, mobile websites run on a firm’s servers, and are built using 
standard web tools such as server-side HTML, Linux, PHP, and SQL. Like all websites, 
the user must be connected to the Web and performance will depend on bandwidth. 
Generally, mobile websites operate more slowly than traditional websites viewed on 
a desktop computer connected to a broadband office network. Most large firms today 
have mobile websites. 
A mobile web app is an application built to run on the mobile web browser built 
into a smartphone or tablet computer. In the case of Apple, the native browser is Safari. 
Generally it is built to mimic the qualities of a native app using HTML5 and Java. 
Mobile web apps are specifically designed for the mobile platform in terms of screen 
size, finger navigation, and graphical simplicity. Mobile web apps can support complex 
interactions used in games and rich media, perform real-time, on-the-fly calculations, 
and can be geo-sensitive using the smartphone’s built-in global positioning system 
(GPS) function. Mobile web apps typically operate faster than mobile websites but not 
as fast as native apps.
A native app is an application designed specifically to operate using the mobile 
device’s hardware and operating system. These stand-alone programs can connect to 
the Internet to download and upload data, and can operate on this data even when 
not connected to the Internet. Download a book to an app reader, disconnect from the 
Internet, and read your book. Because the various types of smartphones have different 
hardware and operating systems, apps are not “one size fits all” and therefore need to 
be developed for different mobile platforms. An Apple app that runs on an iPhone 
cannot operate on Android phones. As you learned in Chapter 3, native apps are built 
using different programming languages depending on the device for which they are 
intended, which is then compiled into binary code, and which executes extremely fast 
on mobile devices, much faster than HTML or Java-based mobile web apps. For this 
reason, native apps are ideal for games, complex interactions, on-the-fly calculations, 
graphic manipulations, and rich media advertising.
Increasingly, developers are combining elements of native apps and mobile web 
apps into hybrid apps. A hybrid app has many of the features of both a native app 
and a mobile web app. Like a native app, it runs inside a native container on the 
mobile device and has access to the device’s APIs, enabling it to take advantage of 
many of the device’s features, such as a gyroscope, that are normally not accessible 
by a mobile web app. It can also be packaged as an app for distribution from an App 
store. Like a mobile web app, it is based on HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, but uses 
the device’s browser engine to render the HTML5 and process the JavaScript locally.
PLANNING AND BUILDING A MOBILE PRESENCE
What is the “right” mobile presence for your firm? The answer depends on identifying 
the business objectives, and from these, deriving the information requirements of 
your mobile presence. The same kind of systems analysis and design (SAD) reasoning 
described earlier in the chapter is needed for planning and building a mobile presence, 
although there are important differences.

The first step is to identify the business objectives you are trying to achieve. 
Table 4.12 illustrates the thought process for the analysis stage of building a mobile 
presence. Why are you developing a mobile presence? Is it to drive sales by creating 
an easily browsed catalog where users can shop and purchase? Strengthen your brand 
by creating an engaging, interactive experience? Enable customers to interact with 
your customer community? How are your competitors using their mobile presence? 
Once you have a clear sense of business objectives, you will be able to describe the 
kind of system functionality that is needed and specify the information requirements 
for your mobile presence.
After you have identified the business objectives, system functionality, and infor-
mation requirements, you can think about how to design and build the system. Now 
is the time to consider which to develop: a mobile website, a mobile web app, or a 
native app. For instance, if your objective is branding or building community, a native 
app might be the best choice because it enables you to deliver a rich, interactive, and 
immersive experience that can strengthen the emotional connection with the brand. 
Because native apps are stored locally on the device, they can be accessed even when 
the user is offline, enabling the user to more deeply engage. In addition, native apps 
can take advantage of the mobile device’s unique characteristics, such as using the 
gyroscope to deliver a 360-degree view. If your objective, on the other hand, is to create 
broad awareness, provide specific information on particular products, or drive sales, 
then a mobile website or mobile web app makes more sense, because it is relatively 
easy and inexpensive to simply publish information to the mobile Web and consum-
ers are still most comfortable completing transactions on the Web (although this is 
changing as more and more retailers add e-commerce functionality directly into apps). 
Increasingly, however, the choice will not be an either/or decision. Mobile apps and 
mobile websites each offer distinct benefits, and in most cases, the best strategy will

MOBILE PRESENCE: DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
Designing a mobile presence is somewhat different from traditional desktop website 
design because of different hardware, software, and consumer expectations. Table 
4.13 describes some of the major differences.
Designers need to take mobile platform constraints into account when designing 
for the mobile platform. File sizes should be kept smaller and the number of files sent 
to the user reduced. Focus on a few, powerful graphics, and minimize the number of 
images sent to the user. Simplify choice boxes and lists so the user can easily scroll 
and touch-select the options. 
Mobile presence has become so important that it is fueling a growing trend to flip 
the traditional e-commerce development process and begin instead with development 
of a mobile presence rather than a desktop website (known as mobile first design). 
Mobile first design has several advantages. Instead of creating a full-featured design 
for a desktop website that then needs to be scaled back, mobile first design focuses on 
creating the best possible experience given mobile platform constraints and then 
adding back elements for the desktop platform, progressively enhancing the function-
ality of the site. Proponents of mobile first design argue that it forces designers to focus 
on what is most important, and this helps create a lean and efficient mobile design 
that functions much better than a design that begins with a traditional platform that 
must be stripped down to work on mobile. Mobile first design is not without its chal-
lenges, however. It can be more difficult for designers who are more comfortable with 
the more traditional process (Byers, 2013).
Other important trends in the development of mobile websites include responsive 
web design and adaptive web design. 
Responsive web design (RWD) tools and design techniques make it possible 
to design a website that automatically adjusts its layout and display according to

Hardware
Mobile hardware is smaller, and there are more resource 
constraints in data storage and processing power.
Connectivity
The mobile platform is constrained by slower connection 
speeds than desktop websites.
Displays
Mobile displays are much smaller and require simplification. 
Some screens are not good in sunlight.
Interface
Touch-screen technology introduces new interaction 
routines different from the traditional mouse and keyboard. 
The mobile platform is not a good data entry tool but can 
be a good navigational tool.

WHEN DESIGNING A MOBILE PRESENCE

the screen resolution of the device on which it is being viewed, whether a desktop, 
tablet, or smartphone. RWD tools include HTML5 and CSS3 and its three key design 
principles involve using flexible grid-based layouts, flexible images and media, and 
media queries. RWD uses the same HTML code and design for each device, but uses 
CSS (which determines the layout of the web page) to adjust the layout and display 
to the screen’s form factor. RWD sites typically work well for sites with relatively 
simple functionality (i.e., sites that primarily deliver content) and that users engage 
with in a similar manner no matter the device being used. However, using RWD 
can be costly, often requiring a complete redesign of the website’s interface. 
Another problem with RWD, particularly if not coupled with mobile first design, is 
that the responsive website still has the size and complexity of a traditional desktop 
site, sometimes making it slow to load and perform on a mobile device. Another 
technique, known as adaptive web design, has been developed to deal with this 
issue.
With adaptive web design (AWD) (sometimes also referred to as adaptive deliv-
ery or responsive web design with server-side components (RESS)), the server hosting the 
website detects the attributes of the device making the request and, using predefined 
templates based on device screen size along with CSS and JavaScript, loads a version 
of the site that is optimized for the device. AWD has a number of advantages, including 
faster load times, the ability to enhance or remove functionality on the fly, and typi-
cally a better user experience, particularly for businesses where user intent differs 
depending on the platform being used. For example, creating its mobile website with 
AWD enabled Lufthansa to focus on actions its mobile users are most likely to take, 
such as checking in, getting flight status information, and looking up travel itineraries, 
and to provide a differentiated experience from its traditional desktop site (Pratap, 
2013). A variation on AWD uses a cloud-based platform to provide similar 
functionality. 
CROSS-PLATFORM MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
In addition to creating native apps from scratch using a programming language such 
as Objective C or Java (as described in Chapter 3), there are hundreds of low-cost or 
open source app development toolkits that make creating cross-platform mobile apps 
relatively easy and inexpensive without having to use a device-specific programming 
language. 
Tools include Appery.io, a cloud-based platform that enables you to a drag-and-
drop visual builder tool to create HTML5 apps using jQuery Mobile. Appery.io supports 
Android, iOS, and Windows Phone applications. Codiqa is a similar tool that is even 
easier to use. It also provides a drag-and-drop interface and builds an app with 100% 
HTML5 components, without the need to do any coding. For those who are even less 
technical, Conduit is a free mobile app builder that allows you to include a variety of 
functionality, including e-commerce, notifications, and a social feed. 
On the more technical side, PhoneGap is a mobile development framework that 
uses software called Apache Cordova to enable building hybrid mobile applications 
using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. MoSync is another advanced tool for developing 
adaptive web design 
(AWD)
server-side technique that 
detects the attributes of 
the device making the 
request and, using 
predefined templates 
based on device screen size 
along with CSS and Java­
Script, loads a version of 
the site that is optimized 
for the device 

cross-platform apps for iOS, Android, Linux Mobile, Windows Mobile, and Symbian 
operating systems. Appcelerator is a similar, less technical tool for creating and manag-
ing hybrid mobile apps. 
MOBILE PRESENCE: PERFORMANCE AND COST CONSIDERATIONS
If you don’t have an existing website, the most efficient process may be to use a mobile 
first design philosophy and design a mobile site first. Alternatively, you may choose 
to build a traditional website using RWD or AWD techniques. If you already have a 
website that you don’t want to totally redevelop, the least expensive path is to resize 
it to create a smartphone-friendly mobile site. Doing so typically will not require a 
complete redesign effort. You will need to reduce the graphics and text, simplify the 
navigation, and focus on improving the customer experience so you do not confuse 
people. Because your customers might still need to use a relatively slow cell connec-
tion at times, you will need to lighten up the amount of data you send. Also, given the 
difficulty of customer data entry on a mobile device, you cannot expect customers to 
happily enter long strings of numbers or text characters. For marketing clarity, make 
sure the brand images used on the mobile website match those on the traditional 
website. The cost of developing a mobile website can range widely, from upwards of 
$1 million for a custom-designed site for a large global enterprise to well under $1,000 
for a small business who chooses a company such as Wix or MoFuse that offers a 
template or mobile website creator. 
Building a mobile web app that uses the mobile device’s browser requires more 
effort and cost than developing a mobile website and suffers from the same limita-
tions as any browser-based application. However, it does offer some advantages such 
as better graphics, more interactivity, and faster local calculations as, for instance, 
in mobile geo-location applications like Foursquare that require local calculations of 
position and then communication with the site’s web server. 
The most expensive path to a mobile presence is to build a native app. Native apps 
can require more programming expertise, although there are many new development 
packages that can build mobile native apps with minimal programming expertise. In 
addition, virtually none of the elements used in your existing website can be reused, 
and you will need to redesign the entire logic of the interface and carefully think 
out the customer experience. For instance, there is a fairly stable HTML traditional 
website interface with buttons, graphics, videos, and ads that has developed over the 
last decade. This is not true for apps. There is no set of standards or expectations even 
on the part of users—every app looks different from every other app. This means the 
user confronts large variations in app design, so your interface must be quite simple 
and obvious. Many of the bells and whistles found on the large desktop website screen 
cannot be used in mobile apps. You’ll need even greater simplification and focus. 
These weaknesses are also native apps’ greatest strength: you have the opportunity to 
create a really stunning, unique customer experience where users can interact with 
your brand. If you want an intense branding experience with your customers, where 
interaction between your brand and customers is effortless and efficient, then native 
apps are the best choice.

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY 
CARNIVAL CRUISE SHIPS GO MOBILE
If you want to take an ocean cruise, 
it’s hard to avoid taking it on a 
Carnival-brand ship. Through a series 
of mergers, acquisitions, and partner-
ships, the British-American firm now 
includes 10 different cruise lines, including such 
well-known brands as Cunard, Princess, Holland 
America, Seaborn, and Carnival. Carnival operates 
over 100 cruise ships, carries 1.7 million guests 
each year, and has over 200,000 berths. It con-
trols 50% of the global cruise market. In 2015, 
it had revenues of $15 billion. In 2016, revenues 
have been stable, but profits have soared 50% 
as the price of fuel has fallen by half. In 2016, 
Carnival had a market worth of $38 billion. 
So suppose the time has come to finally take 
that cruise of a lifetime. You’ve signed up for a 
week-long cruise through the Caribbean Islands 
on a Carnival Cruise ship. You’ve thought about 
this for years. You will relax on a sun-drenched 
deck by the pool. It will be a time to think about 
the important questions in life, a time for you to 
disconnect from all the digital tools that dominate 
your life on land, such as smartphones, e-mail, and 
computers in general. 
Once onboard, though, reality sets in: you’re 
on the latest Carnival Cruise ship, the Carnival 
Breeze. At 130,000 tons, she’s big: 3,600 guests 
on board, 1,000 feet long (3 football fields), and 
1,300 crew to keep you well-fed, entertained, 
exercised, and delighted. There are 10 restaurants, 
from Chinese and BBQ to Italian and a steak 
house, eight drinking establishments, several live 
theaters, several feature film theaters, a thrill 
theater for the kids, a 300-foot water slide, a 
number of spas for adults, a comedy show, and 
even an adults-only meditation center. All of this 
is laid out on 15 decks that run the length of 
the ship—each of them 1,000 feet long. It soon 
becomes apparent to you that just discovering 
what exists on board, let alone finding where on 
the ship it’s located, and how to get there, is a 
significant challenge. Is this a vacation? Where to 
start? You need help!
In the past, Carnival attacked this problem 
of product discovery and navigation through 
ship maps, brochures, video displays on the 
decks, in-room television, and stewards walking 
the decks, directing traffic and answering ques-
tions like, “Where’s the water slide,” and “How 
do I get to Bonsai Sushi?” But technology has 
changed and customers increasingly show up with 
smartphones, along with a new set of expectations 
and behaviors. They want to find things out for 
themselves on their smartphones, just like they do 
at home with Google Maps. They want the ship’s 
map on their screens, with directions. They expect 
to text with and send photos to their friends both 
back home and aboard. They don’t want to ditch 
all their digital connections, but instead expect 
Carnival to serve their digital needs and desires. 
Customers want an on-board mobile companion. 
Carnival needed a new model of how to serve its 
customers. 
Carnival’s solution was the Carnival Hub App, 
a snazzy, complete, at-a-glance guide to the ship, 
available for both Apple and Android devices.
The app includes a daily schedule of hundreds of 
events, a list of restaurants and prices, ship maps, 
and of considerable importance to travelers, their 
on-board charges. The app also has a Chat func-
tion so friends on board can keep track of and 
share experiences. Carnival Hub was introduced 
on a single ship, the Carnival Breeze, in 2015. Over 
33% of the passengers downloaded and used the 
app in its first trial run. Carnival launched Carnival 

Hub throughout its fleet in summer 2016, and as 
of September 2016, it is now available on 14 of 
its ships, with the rest expected to be added by 
March 2017. To keep customers closely connected 
to friends back home, Carnival introduced a $5 
social media package providing unlimited access 
to selected social networks like Facebook and 
Instagram, but not the entire Internet. 
Designing this snazzy app took over a year of 
research. Designers started by interviewing guests 
and employees to discover what concerned them 
most when on board. The key areas for guests, 
in rank order, were how to keep track of their 
charges at all the venues, how to discover what 
events were available, and how to find and com-
municate with their friends on board. With this 
basic information, designers constructed journey 
maps, showing how customers moved through the 
process of being on board, what were they looking 
for, where they found information on events and 
locations, and how they tracked their friends. This 
information helped them design behavioral maps 
for the app describing what information would be 
on each of the app screens, and the user-
flows or navigation patterns of users. The idea 
of journeys was to diagram how users would 
naturally want to navigate the app. The maps 
were then used to create working models of the 
app screens, and the links between the screens. 
Carnival is moving quickly to go beyond 
mobile apps just as ship guides to making apps 
an integral part of the total cruise experience. 
A part of its mobile strategy is to integrate 
betting and gaming services into its mobile apps 
library and onboard entertainment lineup. Using 
the iGaming Mobile Platform, Carnival is now 
offering a mobile casino experience through 
wager-based and free-to-play games, includ-
ing blackjack, poker, sports betting, and bingo. 
Travelers will be able to access a Mobile Casino 
app for Apple and Android devices that provides 
games from leading firms like Scientific Games 
and PokerTrek. Hanging out around the pool, 
or relaxing in their staterooms, guests can play 
poker and bet on the horses and sport events. 
Now this is a vacation!

Taking Control of Its E-commerce Operations
F
ounded in 1948 by Dick Stack in Binghamton, New York, Dick’s Sporting 
Goods has grown from a small local business selling fishing and camping 
supplies into a Fortune 500 business with stores throughout the United 
States. After Stack’s retirement in 1984, his son Edward bought the busi-
ness with his siblings and took over as president. Edward spearheaded the company’s 
growth from a handful of local stores into a sporting goods powerhouse. The company 
sells athletic apparel, outerwear, sportswear, a variety of shoes, fitness equipment, 
and outdoor equipment. Now headquartered in Pennsylvania, Dick’s also runs two 
smaller franchises: its Field & Stream outdoor goods division, and Golf Galaxy for 
golfing supplies. Dick’s prides itself on combining small-business customer service 
with big-box retailer selection and values, and routinely outperforms competitors in 
customer service metrics such as phone and e-mail response time and delivery speed.

Unlike some of its competitors, Dick’s was quick to embrace the online channel 
and has maintained very strong e-commerce sales relative to its competitors in the 
sporting goods industry. Industry surveys in 2015 showed that Dick’s increased its 
e-commerce revenue by 40 percent since 2010, whereas its competitors’ e-commerce 
revenues have increased by roughly 20 percent over that span. For most of that period, 
Dick’s relied on external vendors for its IT and e-commerce needs. The company’s 
primary e-commerce vendor was eBay and its eBay Enterprise suite of e-commerce 
services. EBay handled Dick’s back-end fulfillment processes and most aspects of their 
e-commerce presence for approximately 10 successful years. In 2014, Dick’s reached 
70th on Internet Retailer’s Top 500 list, and the company’s 2015 yearly revenue grew 
19 percent to $748 million, up from $638 million in 2014. E-commerce represented 
10% of total sales for the year.
However, Dick’s overall revenues slumped in 2014, and continued to lag in 2015 
thanks to unseasonably warm weather in the winter. Analysts were also skeptical of 
Dick’s significant financial commitment to large physical stores in an era dominated 
by online shopping. Dick’s had grown to a size where its agreement with eBay was 
costing the company significant revenue. eBay collected a fixed commission on all 
items Dick’s sold online, no matter how big, despite the fact that expensive items cost 
no more for eBay to process than cheaper ones. As Dick’s e-commerce sales continued 
to grow, its deal with eBay was costing it more and more money.
Many bigger businesses have begun migrating their e-commerce operations away 
from external vendors and back within the control of the company to avoid these types 
of expenses. Also, it can be difficult to customize pre-made software and services from 
external vendors. However, once in-house, companies can more easily differenti-
ate their web presences from competitors and adjust their software and services to 
best suit their capabilities. Companies that reclaim their e-commerce operations also 
maintain easier access to their proprietary customer data. Examples of companies 
following this path include Target, which left Amazon Web Services to build its own 
e-commerce platform, and Toys ‘R’ Us, who had also used eBay Enterprise, like Dick’s. 
Facing pressure to slow down physical growth and reduce the high cost of main-
taining physical real estate, and sensing the trend towards e-commerce at the expense 
of in-store sales, Dick’s made the difficult decision to follow suit and formulate a plan 
to take over its own e-commerce operations by the year 2017. The company’s rapidly 
increasing online sales gave Dick’s both the incentive and the budget to undertake the 
transition. Edward Stack explained that the money the company was going to recoup 
from no longer paying transaction commissions to eBay would pay for the temporary 
increase in expenditure required to build and maintain an e-commerce infrastructure. 
Stack estimated that the company stood to immediately save between $20 and $25 
million per year, and with a total expenditure relating to the switch of about $80 
million, the move would pay for itself within four years.
Having total control of its e-commerce operations will allow Dick’s to provide 
better support for unique omnichannel features, such as shipping online orders from 
physical Dick’s stores. To that end, Dick’s has also made plans to convert its stores 
into distribution centers as well as traditional retail showrooms. This will increase 
efficiency and improve delivery times, turning its perceived weakness of excessive

bricks-and-mortar infrastructure into a strength. Approximately 80% of Dicks’ e-com-
merce orders are shipped within the geographical area of a physical store. Dick’s 
foresees its stores functioning not only as traditional retail showcases, but also as 
miniature distribution centers. In addition, customers can order online and pickup 
orders at local stores. Customizing its infrastructure and website capabilities to capital-
ize on this unusual arrangement was one of the reasons it wanted to reclaim operation 
of its e-commerce platform.
The process has three steps. In 2014, Dick’s completed development of its e-com-
merce platform and began integrating its existing systems. In 2015, Dick’s began 
moving two of its lesser brands, Field & Stream and Golf Galaxy, onto the platform, 
and continued development work on the e-commerce platform. In 2016 and 2017, the 
company plans to re-launch its flagship Dick’s Sporting Goods site on the platform. 
Dick’s has launched its smaller sites one at a time to ensure that there are no major 
issues with any aspects of the platform. Both went live without incident in 2015.
Dick’s selected IBM Websphere Commerce Suite for its e-commerce technology 
stack because of its emphasis on omnichannel shopping and fulfillment capability. 
Core components of the stack also include Apache ServiceMix service-oriented archi-
tecture, Manhattan Associates Order Management System for supply chain manage-
ment, JDA Software Group software for merchandising, allocation, and replenishment, 
Oracle PeopleSoft for human resource management, IBM hardware, and Cisco net-
working technology. Manhattan Associates runs Dick’s four Pittsburgh distribution 
centers, and JDA Software Group data is directed into a data warehouse that allows 
Dick’s to access real-time information from any area of their business.
Specific features of the new e-commerce platform that Dick’s has prioritized 
include the ability to buy online and pick up items at a store, the ability to ship from 
or to a store, and its associate ordering system. The platform also features the ability 
to break down and test different pricing and marketing approaches by region, an 
improved search function, and better analytics capabilities. Dick’s has found that 
e-commerce sales double in regions where it opens new stores, and that multichannel 
customers spend three times as much as single-channel customers. That’s why Dick’s 
has focused so much on integrating physical and virtual sales and omnichannel fea-
tures. Bringing all of its e-commerce infrastructure in house also allows the company 
better control over development cycles and speeds up its testing and implementation 
time frames.
The process wasn’t without risk. Installing a completely new e-commerce platform 
is no easy task. It involves integrating legacy systems and new systems without losing 
access to information, hiring a slew of new employees to manage the system, and 
avoiding implementation delays, cost overruns, outages, and other delays. Shifting 
much of its focus to the lower-margin online channel with extremely experienced 
competitors like Amazon lurking is also a challenge. Other competitors of Dick’s 
have struggled to adapt to the omnichannel challenge. For example, Sports Authority 
finalized plans to close all of its remaining stores after it went bankrupt and could not 
find a buyer in 2016. Many retailers have found that their e-commerce growth has not 
been sufficient to offset their struggling bricks-and-mortar segment of their businesses.

However, in 2016, Dick’s has continued its strong e-commerce growth, which it 
believes will allow it to avoid a similar fate. Dick’s hopes to increase its e-commerce 
revenue to $1.2 billion by 2017, or approximately double what it was before ending 
its arrangement with eBay. Dick’s also hopes to continue building physical stores. At 
the end of 2015, Dick’s had 644 stores in 47 states, as well as 73 Golf Galaxy stores and 
19 Field & Stream stores. However, the company believes that if its physical stores 
continue to drive online sales, it can reach as many as 1,100 stores in the United States. 
In 2016, Dick’s opened approximately 40 new stores and relocated several more. The 
company hopes that its revamped e-commerce platform and emphasis on omnichan-
nel retailing will continue to drive both physical and online growth.

•	
Develop a system design specification (both logical design and physical design).
•	
Build the site, either by in-house personnel or by outsourcing all or part of the responsibility to out-
side contractors.
•	
Test the system (unit testing, system testing, acceptance testing, A/B (split) testing, and multivariate 
testing).
•	
Implement and maintain the site.
•	
The basic business and system functionalities an e-commerce site should contain include a digital 
catalog, a product database, customer tracking, shopping cart/payment system, an on-site blog, a cus-
tomer database, an ad server, a site tracking and reporting system, and an inventory management 
system.
•	
Advantages of building a site in-house include the ability to change and adapt the site quickly as the 
market demands and the ability to build a site that does exactly what the company needs.
•	
Disadvantages of building a site in-house include higher costs, greater risks of failure, a more time-
consuming process, and a longer staff learning curve that delays time to market.
•	
Using design templates cuts development time, but preset templates can also limit functionality.
•	
A similar decision is also necessary regarding outsourcing the hosting of the site versus keeping it 
in-house. Relying on an outside vendor places the burden of reliability on someone else in return for a 
monthly hosting fee. The downside is that if the site requires fast upgrades due to heavy traffic, the 
chosen hosting company may or may not be capable of keeping up. Reliability versus scalability is the 
issue in this instance.
Identify and understand the major considerations involved in choosing web server and e-commerce merchant server 
software.
•	
Early websites used single-tier system architecture and consisted of a single-server computer that deliv-
ered static web pages to users making requests through their browsers. The extended functionality of 
today’s websites requires the development of a multi-tiered systems architecture, which utilizes a variety 
of specialized web servers, as well as links to pre-existing backend or legacy corporate databases.
•	
All e-commerce sites require basic web server software to answer requests from customers for HTML and 
XML pages. When choosing web server software, companies are also choosing what operating system the 
site will run on. Apache, which runs on the Unix system, is the market leader.
•	
Web servers provide a host of services, including processing user HTML requests, security services, file 
transfer, a search engine, data capture, e-mail, and site management tools.
•	
Dynamic server software allows sites to deliver dynamic content, rather than static, unchanging informa-
tion. Web application server programs enable a wide range of e-commerce functionality, including creat-
ing a customer database, creating an e-mail promotional program, and accepting and processing orders, 
as well as many other services.
•	
E-commerce merchant server software is another important software package that provides catalog dis-
plays, information storage and customer tracking, order taking (shopping cart), and credit card purchase 
processing. E-commerce software platforms can save time and money, but customization can signifi-
cantly drive up costs. Factors to consider when choosing an e-commerce software platform include its 
functionality, support for different business models, visual site management tools and reporting systems, 
performance and scalability, connectivity to existing business systems, compliance with standards, and 
global and multicultural capability.
Understand the issues involved in choosing the most appropriate hardware for an e-commerce site.
•	
Speed, capacity, and scalability are three of the most important considerations when selecting an operat-
ing system, and therefore the hardware that it runs on.

•	
To evaluate how fast the site needs to be, companies need to assess the number of simultaneous users the 
site expects to see, the nature of their requests, the type of information requested, and the bandwidth 
available to the site. The answers to these questions will provide guidance regarding the processors neces-
sary to meet customer demand. In some cases, additional processing power can increase capacity, 
thereby improving system speed.
•	
Scalability is also an important issue. Increasing processing supply by scaling up to meet demand can be 
done through vertical or horizontal scaling or by improving processing architecture.
Identify additional tools that can improve website performance.
•	
In addition to providing a speedy website, companies must also strive to have a well-designed site that 
encourages visitors to buy. Building in interactivity improves site effectiveness, as do personalization 
techniques. 
•	
Commonly used software tools for achieving high levels of website interactivity and customer personal-
ization include Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts, Active Server Pages (ASP) and ASP.NET, Java 
applets, JavaScript, ActiveX and VBScript, Ajax, PHP, Ruby on Rails (RoR or Rails), and Django.
Understand the important considerations involved in developing a mobile website and building mobile applications.
•	
When developing a mobile presence, it is important to understand the difference between a mobile web-
site, mobile web apps, native apps, and hybrid apps.
•	
The first step is to identify business objectives, because they help determine which type of mobile pres-
ence is best.
•	
Design should take into account mobile platform constraints. Recent trends include mobile first design, 
responsive web design, and adaptive web delivery.
•	
Developing a mobile website is likely to be the least expensive option; mobile web apps require more 
effort and cost; native apps are likely to be the most expensive to develop.

P R O J E C T S
	 1.	 Go to the website of Wix, Weebly, or another provider of your choosing that allows you to create a 
simple e-tailer website for a free trial period. Create a website. The site should feature at least four 
pages, including a home page, product page, shopping cart, and contact page. Extra credit will be given 
for additional complexity and creativity. Come to class prepared to present your e-tailer concept and 
website.
	 2.	 Visit several e-commerce sites, not including those mentioned in this chapter, and evaluate the effective-
ness of the sites according to the eight basic criteria/functionalities listed in Table 4.11. Choose one site 
you feel does an excellent job on all the aspects of an effective site and create an electronic presenta-
tion, including screen shots, to support your choice.
	 3.	 Imagine that you are in charge of developing a fast-growing startup’s e-commerce presence. Consider 
your options for building the company’s e-commerce presence in-house with existing staff, or 
outsourcing the entire operation. Decide which strategy you believe is in your company’s best interest 
and create a brief presentation outlining your position. Why choose that approach? And what are the 
estimated associated costs, compared with the alternative? (You’ll need to make some educated guesses 
here—don’t worry about being exact.)
	 4.	 Choose two e-commerce software packages and prepare an evaluation chart that rates the packages on 
the key factors discussed in the section “Choosing an E-commerce Software Platform.” Which package 
would you choose if you were developing a website of the type described in this chapter, and why?
	 5.	 Choose one of the open source web content management systems such as WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal 
or another of your own choosing and prepare an evaluation chart similar to that required by Project 4. 
Which system would you choose and why?

rom the earliest of days, humans have 
warred against each other, with the 
tools of warfare evolving over time 
from sticks and stones, to arrows and spears, to ar-
tillery and bombs. Physical warfare and weaponry 
are familiar and readily recognizable. But today, 
there is also another type of warfare that is becom-
ing increasingly common, a type that is conduct-
ed by hidden armies of hackers wielding weaponry 
that consists of algorithms and computer code. 
Cyberspace has become a new battlefield, one that 
often involves nations against other nations, and 
nations against corporations. The targets include 
defense installations, nuclear facilities, public infra-
structure, banks, manufacturing firms, and commu-
nications networks. There are two primary objectives 
of this kind of warfare: obtaining intellectual prop-
erty (a kind of economic warfare) and attacking the ability of other nations to function. 
One of the problems of warfare is that your enemy may possess the same weapons 
as you do. In the context of thermonuclear warfare, politicians have negotiated treaties 
based on the so-called doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD): the recognition 
that even a first attacker would ultimately perish in the counterattack. Today, cyberwar-
fare has some striking similarities: an attack by a nation against its enemy’s cyberinfra-
structure might unleash a counterattack so powerful that critical infrastructure in both 
nations would be heavily damaged and shut down. 
The United States, China, Russia, and many other nations are preparing today for 
such a cyberwar, hoping it won’t happen, but developing new weapons and practicing 
defensive techniques. For example, in April 2016, NATO, an alliance of countries from 
North America and Europe, brought together 550 military and corporate leaders from 
26 nations for the 7th annual Locked Shields cyberwar games, the largest such games 
in the world. Using the Estonian Cyber Range, a sort of firing range for cyberwarriors, 
the national Blue Teams had to defend their countries against an all-out Red Team cy-
berattack, with the emphasis on defensive strategies and keeping the infrastructure of 
their countries working. The U.S. Department of Defense conducted its 5th Cyber Guard 
cyberwar games exercise in August 2016. Over 100 organizations and 800 people, from 
both armed forces and private corporations, participated in the games. 
A cyberarms race has already started. The big countries in cyberwar are the United 
States, Great Britain, China, Russia, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, and India, but many smaller

countries like Denmark, the Netherlands, Estonia, and tiny Belarus are building their ar-
senals. Unlike nuclear weapons, cyberwar is so inexpensive that even small nations can 
afford it. A recent report documented 29 countries with formal military and intelligence 
units dedicated to offensive cyberwar, 49 that have purchased off-the-shelf hacking soft-
ware, and 63 currently engaged in electronic surveillance of their own and other popu-
lations. Countries are developing cyberarsenals that include collections of malware for 
penetrating industrial, military, and critical civilian infrastructure controllers, e-mail lists 
and text for phishing attacks on important targets, and algorithms for denial of service 
(DoS) attacks. The computer code has been tested and ready to go for offensive purposes 
to surprise and cripple enemy systems. 
Cyberattacks on information systems have also been on the rise over the past few 
years. Such attacks, while not real cyberwar in the sense of incapacitating infrastructure, 
nevertheless illustrate the ease with which corporate and government systems can be pen-
etrated. Some of these attacks were likely undertaken by nation states that were practicing 
their offensive techniques. For instance, in 2014, Sony Pictures’ computer system was 
hacked, revealing information on 47,000 individuals, much of it e-mail correspondence 
among executives. About 70% of the firm’s computers were incapacitated, and confi-
dential e-mails were published by the hackers in an effort to embarrass executives of the 
firm. North Korea remains a major suspect, although North Korean officials denied this. 
In the biggest attack on U.S. government systems thus far, in July 2015, the White House 
announced that the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources 
agency and database, had been hacked and complete records on over 21 million people 
were copied, including the names of people in the defense sector. The likely source of the 
hack was the Chinese government. In 2016, U.S. intelligence agencies have reportedly 
expressed suspicions that the hacks into various e-mail accounts of Democratic National 
Committee officials and others associated with the Clinton campaign have been part of 
an orchestrated campaign by Russia to influence the 2016 presidential race. The Russian 
government has denied any involvement. 
Attacks against physical infrastructure have been less frequent. Infrastructure attacks 
require detailed knowledge of the infrastructure, which usually requires insider knowl-
edge of industrial controllers (computers that control valves and machines). The most 
well-known and best documented infrastructure attack was Stuxnet, malware allegedly 
created by Israeli and American intelligence services in 2010 in an effort to cripple thou-
sands of Iranian nuclear centrifuges. Stuxnet was a malware virus program planted in 
industrial controller modules of Iranian nuclear fuel centrifuges, causing them to destroy 
themselves. Stuxnet was precedent-setting: it was the first large-scale cyberattack on 
infrastructure. In response, the Iranian government sponsored a cyberattack against the 
Saudi-Aramco company using a virus called Shamoon that wiped out 30,000 computers 
at the company. More recently, Russian hackers, allegedly employed by the Russian gov-
ernment, have picked up the spirit of Stuxnet and have targeted oil and gas firms. Using 
a “watering hole attack,” the hackers launched a massive e-mail campaign to employees 
of these firms in an attempt to trick them into visiting a website where malware can be 
downloaded to their computers. While the emphasis of the attackers has been industrial

espionage, the same software could be used in a cyberwar attack against oil and gas pro-
duction and transmission facilities just like the Stuxnet software that crippled Iranian 
nuclear centrifuges. Other infrastructure attacks include weapons known as Flame, which 
is thought to have caused Iran to disconnect its oil terminals from the Internet, and Snake, 
a malware tool kit believed to be from Russia that infected many Ukrainian civilian and 
industrial computer systems and networks. Snake gives attackers full access to remote 
systems, acts as a two-way conduit that can siphon information from systems, and pro-
vides a path for installing additional malware. Using these cyberweapons, Russia has led 
a three-year campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure and government systems, most 
recently in December 2015, when power was lost across multiple cities in Western Ukraine.
Security analysts believe the United States has developed the most powerful cyber-
warfare defense and offense capabilities in the world. U.S. efforts are concentrated in 
the United States Cyber Command located in Fort Meade, Maryland. USCYBERCOM’s 
stated mission is to coordinate and direct the operations and defense of Department of 
Defense (DoD) information networks and to prepare for military cyberspace operations in 
order to enable actions in all domains, ensure US/Allied freedom of action in cyberspace, 
and deny the same to adversaries. In early 2016, the DoD detailed a $35 billion five-year 
cyberbudget aimed at furthering DoD’s network defenses, building more cybertraining 
ranges for its cyberwarriors, and developing cybertools and infrastructure to provide of-
fensive cyberweapons.
A number of diplomatic efforts have been undertaken by American planners to reach 
some sort of understanding with its cyberenemies that would set limits on cyberwar and 
prevent civilian casualties. These efforts are similar to nuclear arms treaties. In 2015, 
the Pentagon announced a new cyberstrategy outlining the conditions under which the 
United States would engage in a cyberweapons attack on an adversary. Routine attacks 
against companies will be defended by companies themselves, but attacks on U.S. gov-
ernment systems, infrastructure systems, defense systems, and intelligence systems that 
involve significant loss of life, destruction of property, or lasting economic damage, will 
be grounds for launching a major counterattack that will threaten similar losses to the 
enemy. This new policy is aimed at Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, each of whom 
have been implicated in state-sponsored attacks on U.S. government and corporate systems 
for several years. Announcing this new policy raises the potential cost of hacking critical 
American systems, and is the beginning of a deterrence strategy based on the concept of 
mutual assured destruction. 
In September 2015, the Obama administration finally reached an understanding with 
Chinese leaders. The presidents of both countries announced their pledge to refrain from 
computer-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial gain, and attacks on their 
country’s critical infrastructure, but there was no agreement to limit the use of cybertools 
for traditional espionage. A pledge is hardly a commitment and is certainly not a treaty. 
There is no verification protocol to ensure compliance. Nevertheless, this was the first 
agreement of any kind expressing the goal of restraining cyberwarfare, and since then, it 
appears that China has shifted its cyberespionage focus away from the United States and 
Western organizations to other areas of the world.

s Cyberwar: MAD 2.0 illustrates, the Internet and Web are increasingly 
vulnerable to large-scale attacks and potentially large-scale failure. 
Increasingly, these attacks are led by organized gangs of criminals 
operating globally—an unintended consequence of globalization. Even more worri-
some is the growing number of large-scale attacks that are funded, organized, and led 
by various nations against the Internet resources of other nations. Anticipating and 
countering these attacks has proved a difficult task for both business and government 
organizations. However, there are several steps you can take to protect your websites, 
your mobile devices, and your personal information from routine security attacks. 
Reading this chapter, you should also start thinking about how your business could 
survive in the event of a large-scale “outage” of the Internet.
In this chapter, we will examine e-commerce security and payment issues. First, 
we will identify the major security risks and their costs, and describe the variety of 
solutions currently available. Then, we will look at the major payment methods and 
consider how to achieve a secure payment environment. Table 5.1 highlights some 
of the major trends in online security in 2016–2017.
	 5.1	
THE E-COMMERCE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT
For most law-abiding citizens, the Internet holds the promise of a huge and conve-
nient global marketplace, providing access to people, goods, services, and businesses 
worldwide, all at a bargain price. For criminals, the Internet has created entirely 
new—and lucrative—ways to steal from the more than 1.6 billion Internet consumers

worldwide in 2016. From products and services, to cash, to information, it’s all there 
for the taking on the Internet.
It’s also less risky to steal online. Rather than rob a bank in person, the Internet 
makes it possible to rob people remotely and almost anonymously. Rather than steal 
a CD at a local record store, you can download the same music for free and almost 
without risk from the Internet. The potential for anonymity on the Internet cloaks 
many criminals in legitimate-looking identities, allowing them to place fraudulent 
orders with online merchants, steal information by intercepting e-mail, or simply shut 
down e-commerce sites by using software viruses and swarm attacks. The Internet 
was never designed to be a global marketplace with billions of users and lacks many 
basic security features found in older networks such as the telephone system or broad-
cast television networks. By comparison, the Internet is an open, vulnerable-design 
network. The actions of cybercriminals are costly for both businesses and consumers, 
who are then subjected to higher prices and additional security measures. The costs 
of malicious cyberactivity include not just the cost of the actual crime, but also the 
additional costs that are required to secure networks and recover from cyberattacks, 
the potential reputational damage to the affected company, as well as reduced trust in 
online activities, the loss of potentially sensitive business information, including intel-
lectual property and confidential business information, and the cost of opportunities 
lost due to service disruptions. Ponemon Institute estimates that the average total cost 
of a data breach to U.S. corporations in 2016 was $4 million (Ponemon Institute, 2016).
THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM
Cybercrime is becoming a more significant problem for both organizations and con-
sumers. Bot networks, DDoS attacks, Trojans, phishing, ransomware, data theft, iden-
tity fraud, credit card fraud, and spyware are just some of the threats that are making 
daily headlines. Social networks also have had security breaches. But despite the 
increasing attention being paid to cybercrime, it is difficult to accurately estimate the 
actual amount of such crime, in part because many companies are hesitant to report 
it due to the fear of losing the trust of their customers, and because even if crime is 
reported, it may be difficult to quantify the actual dollar amount of the loss. A 2014 
study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies examined the difficulties 
in accurately estimating the economic impact of cybercrime and cyberespionage, 
with its research indicating a range of $375 billion to $575 billion worldwide. Further 
research is planned to try to help determine an even more accurate estimate (Center 
for Strategic and International Studies, 2014).
One source of information is a survey conducted by Ponemon Institute of 58 repre-
sentative U.S. companies in various industries. The 2015 survey found that the average 
annualized cost of cybercrime for the organizations in the study was $15 million, rep-
resenting a 20% increase from the previous year, and an 82% increase since the first 
survey in 2009. The average cost per attack was more than $1.9 million, a 22% increase 
from the previous year. The number of successful cyberattacks also increased, by over 
15%. The most costly cybercrimes were those caused by denial of service, malicious 
insiders, and malicious code. The most prevalent types of attacks were viruses, worms, 
and Trojans, experienced by 100% of the companies surveyed, followed by malware

(97%), web-based attacks (76%), botnets (66%), phishing and social engineering attacks 
(59%), and malicious code (52%) (Ponemon Institute, 2015a). 
Reports issued by security product providers, such as Symantec, are another 
source of data. Symantec issues a semi-annual Internet Security Threat Report, based 
on 57.6 million sensors monitoring Internet activity in more than 157 countries. 
Advances in technology have greatly reduced the entry costs and skills required to 
enter the cybercrime business. Low-cost and readily available web attack kits enable 
hackers to create malware without having to write software from scratch. In addition, 
there has been a surge in polymorphic malware, which enables attackers to gener-
ate a unique version of the malware for each victim, making it much more difficult 
for pattern-matching software used by security firms to detect. According to Syman-
tec, the number of data breaches increased 23% in 2015, over half a billion personal 
records were stolen, the number of spear-phishing attacks increased by 55%, malware 
increased by 36%, and ransomware attacks grew by 35% (Symantec, 2016). However, 
Symantec does not attempt to quantify actual crimes and/or losses related to these 
threats.
Online credit card fraud is one of the most high-profile forms of e-commerce 
crime. Although the average amount of credit card fraud loss experienced by any one 
individual is typically relatively small, the overall amount is substantial. The overall 
rate of online credit card fraud is estimated to be about 0.8% of all online card transac-
tions, including both mobile and web transactions (Cybersource, 2016). The nature of 
credit card fraud has changed greatly from the theft of a single credit card number and 
efforts to purchase goods at a few sites, to the simultaneous theft of millions of credit 
card numbers and their distributions to thousands of criminals operating as gangs of 
thieves. The emergence of identity fraud, described in detail later in this chapter, as 
a major online/offline type of fraud may well increase markedly the incidence and 
amount of credit card fraud, because identity fraud often includes the use of stolen 
credit card information and the creation of phony credit card accounts. 
The Underground Economy Marketplace: The Value of Stolen Information
Criminals who steal information on the Internet do not always use this informa-
tion themselves, but instead derive value by selling the information to others on the 
so-called underground or shadow economy market. Data is currency to cybercrimi-
nals and has a “street value” that can be monetized. For example, in 2013, Vladislav 
Horohorin (alias “BadB”) was sentenced to over 7 years in federal prison for using 
online criminal forums to sell stolen credit and debit card information (referred to as 
“dumps”). At the time of his arrest, Horohorin possessed over 2.5 million stolen credit 
and debit card numbers. There are several thousand known underground economy 
marketplaces around the world that sell stolen information, as well as malware, such 
as exploit kits, access to botnets, and more. Table 5.2 lists some recently observed 
prices for various types of stolen data, which typically vary depending on the quan-
tity being purchased, supply available, and “freshness.” For example, when credit card 
information from the Target data breach first appeared on the market, individual card 
numbers went for up to $120 each. After a few weeks, however, the price dropped 

	
T h e  E - c o m m e r c e  S e c u r i t y  E n v i r o n m e n t

257
dramatically (Leger, 2014). Experts believe the cost of stolen information has gener-
ally fallen as the tools of harvesting have increased the supply. On the demand side, 
the same efficiencies and opportunities provided by new technology have increased 
the number of people who want to use stolen information. It’s a robust marketplace.
Finding these marketplaces and the servers that host them can be difficult for 
the average user (and for law enforcement agencies), and prospective participants 
are typically vetted by other criminals before access is granted. This vetting process 
takes place through Twitter, Tor, and VPN services, and sometimes e-mail exchanges 
of information, money (often Bitcoins, a form of digital cash that we discuss further 
in Section 5.5 and in the Insight on Business case study on pages 315–316), and reputa-
tion. There is a general hierarchy of cybercriminals in the marketplace, with low-level, 
nontechnical criminals who frequent “carder forums,” where stolen credit and debit 
card data is sold, aiming to make money, a political statement, or both, at the bottom; 
resellers in the middle acting as intermediaries; and the technical masterminds who 
create malicious code at the top. 
So, what can we can conclude about the overall size of cybercrime? Cybercrime 
against e-commerce sites is dynamic and changing all the time, with new risks appear-
ing often. The amount of losses to businesses is significant and growing. The managers 
of e-commerce sites must prepare for an ever-changing variety of criminal assaults, 
and keep current in the latest security techniques.

WHAT IS GOOD E-COMMERCE SECURITY?
What is a secure commercial transaction? Anytime you go into a marketplace you 
take risks, including the loss of privacy (information about what you purchased). Your 
prime risk as a consumer is that you do not get what you paid for. As a merchant in the 
market, your risk is that you don’t get paid for what you sell. Thieves take merchan-
dise and then either walk off without paying anything, or pay you with a fraudulent 
instrument, stolen credit card, or forged currency.
E-commerce merchants and consumers face many of the same risks as participants 
in traditional commerce, albeit in a new digital environment. Theft is theft, regard-
less of whether it is digital theft or traditional theft. Burglary, breaking and entering, 
embezzlement, trespass, malicious destruction, vandalism—all crimes in a traditional 
commercial environment—are also present in e-commerce. However, reducing risks 
in e-commerce is a complex process that involves new technologies, organizational 
policies and procedures, and new laws and industry standards that empower law 
enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute offenders. Figure 5.1 illustrates 
the multi-layered nature of e-commerce security.
To achieve the highest degree of security possible, new technologies are available 
and should be used. But these technologies by themselves do not solve the problem. 
Organizational policies and procedures are required to ensure the technologies are 
not subverted. Finally, industry standards and government laws are required to 
enforce payment mechanisms, as well as to investigate and prosecute violators of 
laws designed to protect the transfer of property in commercial transactions.
	
FIGURE 5.1	
THE E-COMMERCE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT
E-commerce security is multi-layered, and must take into account new technology, policies and procedures, 
and laws and industry standards.

The history of security in commercial transactions teaches that any security 
system can be broken if enough resources are put against it. Security is not absolute. 
In addition, perfect security of every item is not needed forever, especially in the infor-
mation age. There is a time value to information—just as there is to money. Sometimes 
it is sufficient to protect a message for a few hours or days. Also, because security is 
costly, we always have to weigh the cost against the potential loss. Finally, we have 
also learned that security is a chain that breaks most often at the weakest link. Our 
locks are often much stronger than our management of the keys.
We can conclude then that good e-commerce security requires a set of laws, pro-
cedures, policies, and technologies that, to the extent feasible, protect individuals and 
organizations from unexpected behavior in the e-commerce marketplace.
DIMENSIONS OF E-COMMERCE SECURITY
There are six key dimensions to e-commerce security: integrity, nonrepudiation, 
authenticity, confidentiality, privacy, and availability.
Integrity refers to the ability to ensure that information being displayed on a 
website, or transmitted or received over the Internet, has not been altered in any way 
by an unauthorized party. For example, if an unauthorized person intercepts and 
changes the contents of an online communication, such as by redirecting a bank wire 
transfer into a different account, the integrity of the message has been compromised 
because the communication no longer represents what the original sender intended.
Nonrepudiation refers to the ability to ensure that e-commerce participants do 
not deny (i.e., repudiate) their online actions. For instance, the availability of free 
e-mail accounts with alias names makes it easy for a person to post comments or 
send a message and perhaps later deny doing so. Even when a customer uses a real 
name and e-mail address, it is easy for that customer to order merchandise online 
and then later deny doing so. In most cases, because merchants typically do not 
obtain a physical copy of a signature, the credit card issuer will side with the customer 
because the merchant has no legally valid proof that the customer ordered the mer-
chandise.
Authenticity refers to the ability to identify the identity of a person or entity 
with whom you are dealing on the Internet. How does the customer know that the 
website operator is who it claims to be? How can the merchant be assured that the 
customer is really who she says she is? Someone who claims to be someone he is not 
is “spoofing” or misrepresenting himself.
Confidentiality refers to the ability to ensure that messages and data are avail-
able only to those who are authorized to view them. Confidentiality is sometimes 
confused with privacy, which refers to the ability to control the use of information a 
customer provides about himself or herself to an e-commerce merchant.
E-commerce merchants have two concerns related to privacy. They must establish 
internal policies that govern their own use of customer information, and they must 
protect that information from illegitimate or unauthorized use. For example, if hackers 
break into an e-commerce site and gain access to credit card or other information, this 
violates not only the confidentiality of the data, but also the privacy of the individuals 
who supplied the information.

TABLE 5.3	
CUSTOMER AND MERCHANT PERSPECTIVES ON THE 
DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF E-COMMERCE SECURITY
Availability refers to the ability to ensure that an e-commerce site continues to 
function as intended.
Table 5.3 summarizes these dimensions from both the merchants’ and customers’ 
perspectives. E-commerce security is designed to protect these six dimensions. When 
any one of them is compromised, overall security suffers.
THE TENSION BETWEEN SECURITY AND OTHER VALUES
Can there be too much security? The answer is yes. Contrary to what some may 
believe, security is not an unmitigated good. Computer security adds overhead and 
expense to business operations, and also gives criminals new opportunities to hide 
their intentions and their crimes.
Ease of Use
There are inevitable tensions between security and ease of use. When traditional 
merchants are so fearful of robbers that they do business in shops locked behind 
security gates, ordinary customers are discouraged from walking in. The same can be 
true with respect to e-commerce. In general, the more security measures added to an 
availability
the ability to ensure that

e-commerce site, the more difficult it is to use and the slower the site becomes. As you 
will discover reading this chapter, digital security is purchased at the price of slowing 
down processors and adding significantly to data storage demands on storage devices. 
Security is a technological and business overhead that can detract from doing business. 
Too much security can harm profitability, while not enough security can potentially 
put you out of business. One solution is to adjust security settings to the user’s prefer-
ences. A recent McKinsey report found that when consumers find authentication at 
websites easy, they purchased 10% to 20% more. About 30% of the Internet population 
prioritizes ease of use and convenience over security, while 10% prioritize security. 
The report suggests it is possible to have both ease of use and security by adjusting the 
authentication process for each customer, providing options from automatic login (low 
security), to downloadable one-time passwords (high security) (Hasham, et al., 2016).
Public Safety and the Criminal Uses of the Internet
There is also an inevitable tension between the desires of individuals to act anony-
mously (to hide their identity) and the needs of public officials to maintain public 
safety that can be threatened by criminals or terrorists. This is not a new problem, or 
even new to the electronic era. The U.S. government began tapping telegraph wires 
during the Civil War in the mid-1860s in order to trap conspirators and terrorists, and 
the first police wiretaps of local telephone systems were in place by the 1890s—20 
years after the invention of the phone (Schwartz, 2001). No nation-state has ever per-
mitted a technological haven to exist where criminals can plan crimes or threaten 
the nation-state without fear of official surveillance or investigation. In this sense, the 
Internet is no different from any other communication system. Drug cartels make 
extensive use of voice, fax, the Internet, and encrypted e-mail; a number of large 
international organized crime groups steal information from commercial websites 
and resell it to other criminals who use it for financial fraud. Over the years, the U.S. 
government has successfully pursued various “carding forums” (websites that facili-
tate the sale of stolen credit card and debit card numbers), such as Shadowcrew, Car-
derplanet, and Cardersmarket, resulting in the arrest and prosecution of a number 
of their members and the closing of the sites. However, other criminal organizations 
have emerged to take their place.
The Internet and mobile platform also provide terrorists with convenient com-
munications channels. Encrypted files sent via e-mail were used by Ramzi Yousef—a 
member of the terrorist group responsible for bombing the World Trade Center in 
1993—to hide plans for bombing 11 U.S. airliners. The Internet was also used to plan 
and coordinate the subsequent attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 
2001. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab further illustrates how terrorists make 
effective use of the Internet to radicalize, recruit, train, and coordinate youthful ter-
rorists. Abdulmutallab allegedly attempted to blow up an American airliner in Detroit 
on Christmas Day 2009. He was identified, contacted, recruited, and trained, all within 
six weeks, according to a Pentagon counterterrorism official. In an effort to combat 
such terrorism, the U.S. government has significantly ramped up its surveillance of 
communications delivered via the Internet over the past several years. The extent of 
that surveillance created a major controversy with National Security Agency contrac-

tor Edward Snowden’s release of classified NSA documents that revealed that the NSA 
had obtained access to the servers of major Internet companies such as Facebook, 
Google, Apple, Microsoft, and others, as well as that NSA analysts have been searching 
e-mail, online chats, and browsing histories of U.S. citizens without any court approval. 
Security agencies have shifted from mass surveillance to smaller, targeted surveil-
lance of terrorists and terrorist groups, and the use of predictive algorithms to focus 
their efforts (N.F. Johnson, et al., 2016). The proper balance between public safety 
and privacy in the effort against terrorism has proven to be a very thorny problem 
for the U.S. government.

SECURITY THREATS IN THE E-COMMERCE 
ENVIRONMENT
From a technology perspective, there are three key points of vulnerability when 
dealing with e-commerce: the client, the server, and the communications pipeline.

card to purchase a product. Figure 5.3 illustrates some of the things that can go wrong 
at each major vulnerability point in the transaction—over Internet communications 
channels, at the server level, and at the client level.
In this section, we describe a number of the most common and most damaging 
forms of security threats to e-commerce consumers and site operators: malicious code, 
potentially unwanted programs, phishing, hacking and cybervandalism, credit card 
fraud/theft, spoofing, pharming, spam (junk) websites (link farms), identity fraud, 
Denial of Service (DoS) and DDoS attacks, sniffing, insider attacks, poorly designed 
server and client software, social network security issues, mobile platform security 
issues, and finally, cloud security issues.
MALICIOUS CODE
Malicious code (sometimes referred to as “malware”) includes a variety of threats such 
as viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, and bots. Some malicious code, some-
times referred to as an exploit, is designed to take advantage of software vulnerabilities 
in a computer’s operating system, web browser, applications, or other software compo-
nents. Exploit kits are collections of exploits bundled together and rented or sold as a 
commercial product, often with slick user interfaces and in-depth analytics functional-
ity. Use of an exploit kit typically does not require much technical skill, enabling novices

to become cybercriminals. Exploit kits typically target software that is widely deployed, 
such as Microsoft Windows, Internet Explorer, Adobe Flash and Reader, and Oracle Java. 
In 2014, according to Cisco, Angler, an exploit kit that uses Flash, Java, Microsoft Inter-
net Explorer, and Microsoft Silverlight vulnerabilities, was one of the exploit kits most 
observed “in the wild” (Cisco, 2016). According to Symantec, more than 430 million new 
variants of malware were created in 2015, an average of more than a million strains a 
day, up 36% in one year (Symantec, 2016). In the past, malicious code was often 
intended to simply impair computers, and was often authored by a lone hacker, but 
increasingly it involves a small group of hackers or a nation-state supported group, and 
the intent is to steal e-mail addresses, logon credentials, personal data, and financial 
information. It’s the difference between petty crime and organized crime.
Malware is often delivered in the form of a malicious attachment to an email or 
embedded as a link in the email. Malicious links can also be placed in innocent-looking 
Microsoft Word or Excel documents. The links lead directly to a malicious code down-
load or websites that include malicious code (Symantec, 2016). One of the latest inno-
vations in malicious code distribution is to embed it in the online advertising chain 
(known as maladvertising), including in Google, AOL, and other ad networks (Goodin, 
2016). As the ad network chain becomes more complicated, it becomes more and more 
difficult for websites to vet ads placed on their sites to ensure they are malware-free. 
A 2014 research study indicated that as many as 1% of all ads served may be malad-
vertising (Zarras et al., 2014). The largest advertising malware infection occurred at 
Yahoo where more than 6.9 million daily visitors were exposed to malicious pop-up ads 
(Blue, 2016). These malicious ads can be stopped by turning on pop-up blockers in 
users’ browsers. Much of the maladvertising in the recent years has been in the form 
of drive-by downloads that exploited the frequent zero-day vulnerabilities that have 
plagued Adobe Flash, which is often used for online advertisements. As a result, the 
Internet Advertising Bureau has urged advertisers to abandon Adobe Flash in favor of 
HTML5, and Mozilla Firefox, Apple’s Safari, and Google’s Chrome browser all now block 
Flash advertisements from autoplaying. Amazon has also stopped accepting Flash ads 
(see the Chapter 3 Insight on Technology case, The Rise of HTML5). A drive-by down-
load is malware that comes with a downloaded file that a user intentionally or unin-
tentionally requests. Drive-by is now one of the most common methods of infecting 
computers. For instance, websites as disparate as the New York Times, MSN, Yahoo, 
and AOL have experienced instances where ads placed on their sites either had mali-
cious code embedded or directed clickers to malicious sites. According to Symantec, 
drive-by download exploit kits, including updates and 24/7 support, can be rented for 
between $100 to $700 per week. Malicious code embedded in PDF files also is common. 
Equally important, there has been a major shift in the writers of malware from amateur 
hackers and adventurers to organized criminal efforts to defraud companies and indi-
viduals. In other words, it’s now more about the money than ever before.
A virus is a computer program that has the ability to replicate or make copies of 
itself, and spread to other files. In addition to the ability to replicate, most computer 
viruses deliver a “payload.” The payload may be relatively benign, such as the display 
of a message or image, or it may be highly destructive—destroying files, reformatting 
the computer’s hard drive, or causing programs to run improperly.

Viruses are often combined with a worm. Instead of just spreading from file to 
file, a worm is designed to spread from computer to computer. A worm does not nec-
essarily need to be activated by a user or program in order for it to replicate itself. The 
Slammer worm is one of the most notorious. Slammer targeted a known vulnerability 
in Microsoft’s SQL Server database software and infected more than 90% of vulnerable 
computers worldwide within 10 minutes of its release on the Internet; crashed Bank 
of America cash machines, especially in the southwestern part of the United States; 
affected cash registers at supermarkets such as the Publix chain in Atlanta, where staff 
could not dispense cash to frustrated buyers; and took down most Internet connec-
tions in South Korea, causing a dip in the stock market there. The Conficker worm, 
which first appeared in November 2008, is the most significant worm since Slammer, 
and reportedly infected 11 million computers worldwide (Microsoft, 2015). Originally 
designed to establish a global botnet, a massive industry effort has defeated this effort, 
but Conficker still resides on over 800,000 Internet devices in 2016. It is the most 
widely detected malware on the Internet.
Ransomware (scareware) is a type of malware (often a worm) that locks your 
computer or files to stop you from accessing them. Ransomware will often display a 
notice that says an authority such as the FBI, Department of Justice, or IRS has detected 
illegal activity on your computer and demands that you pay a fine in order to unlock 
the computer and avoid prosecution. One type of ransomware is named CryptoLocker. 
CryptoLocker encrypts victims’ files with a virtually unbreakable asymmetric encryp-
tion and demands a ransom to decrypt them, often in Bitcoins. If the victim does not 
comply within the time allowed, the files will not ever be able to be decrypted. Other 
variants include CryptoDefense and Cryptowall. Ransomware attacks increased by over 
400% in 2016, and the U.S. Department of Justice reports that there are over 4,000 ran-
somware attacks daily, up from 1,000 daily in 2015 (U.S. Department of Justice, 2016). 
Crypto-ransomware infections often take place via a malicious e-mail attachment that 
purports to be an invoice (Symantec, 2016). The growth of ransomware is also related 
to the growth of the virtual currency Bitcoin. Hackers often demand victims pay using 
Bitcoin so their transactions are hidden from authorities (McMillan, 2016).
A Trojan horse appears to be benign, but then does something other than 
expected. The Trojan horse is not itself a virus because it does not replicate, but is 
often a way for viruses or other malicious code such as bots or rootkits (a program 
whose aim is to subvert control of the computer’s operating system) to be introduced 
into a computer system. The term Trojan horse refers to the huge wooden horse in 
Homer’s Iliad that the Greeks gave their opponents, the Trojans—a gift that actually 
contained hundreds of Greek soldiers. Once the people of Troy let the massive horse 
within their gates, the soldiers revealed themselves and captured the city. In today’s 
world, a Trojan horse may masquerade as a game, but actually hide a program to steal 
your passwords and e-mail them to another person. Miscellaneous Trojans and Trojan 
downloaders and droppers (Trojans that install malicious files to a computer they have 
infected by either downloading them from a remote computer or from a copy con-
tained in their own code) are a common type of malware. According to Panda Security, 
Trojans accounted for over 50% of all malware created in 2015, and over 60% of all 
malware infections (Panda Security, 2016). In 2011, Sony experienced the largest data

breach in history up to that time when a Trojan horse took over the administrative 
computers of Sony’s PlayStation game center and downloaded personal and credit card 
information involving 77 million registered users (Wakabayashi, 2011). Trojan horses 
are often used for financial malware distributed via botnets. One example is Zeus, 
which steals information by keystroke logging and has infected over 10 million com-
puters since it first became known in 2007. Other examples include SpyEye, a Trojan 
that can steal banking information via both a keylogging application and the ability 
to take screenshots on a victim’s computer; Torpig, a botnet that is spread by a Trojan 
horse called Meboot; and Vawtrak, a Trojan that spreads via social media, e-mail, and 
FTP, and is able to hide evidence of fraud by changing bank balances shown to the 
victim on the fly (Cyphort, 2015). 
A backdoor is a feature of viruses, worms, and Trojans that allows an attacker to 
remotely access a compromised computer. Downadup is an example of a worm with 
a backdoor, while Virut, a virus that infects various file types, also includes a backdoor 
that can be used to download and install additional threats.
Bots (short for robots) are a type of malicious code that can be covertly installed 
on your computer when attached to the Internet. Once installed, the bot responds 
to external commands sent by the attacker; your computer becomes a “zombie” and 
is able to be controlled by an external third party (the “bot-herder”). Botnets are 
collections of captured computers used for malicious activities such as sending spam, 
participating in a DDoS attack, stealing information from computers, and storing 
network traffic for later analysis. The number of botnets operating worldwide is not 
known but is estimated to be well into the thousands, controlling millions of com-
puters. Bots and bot networks are an important threat to the Internet and e-com-
merce because they can be used to launch very large-scale attacks using many 
different techniques. In 2011, federal marshals accompanied members of Microsoft’s 
digital crimes unit in raids designed to disable the Rustock botnet, at that time the 
leading source of spam in the world with nearly 500,000 slave PCs under the control 
of its command and control servers located at six Internet hosting services in the 
United States. Officials confiscated the Rustock control servers at the hosting sites, 
which claimed they had no idea what the Rustock servers were doing. The actual 
spam e-mails were sent by the slave PCs under the command of the Rustock servers 
(Wingfield, 2011). In 2013, Microsoft and the FBI engaged in another aggressive 
botnet operation, targeting 1,400 of Zeus-derived Citadel botnets, which had been 
used in 2012 to raid bank accounts at major banks around the world, netting over 
$500 million (Chirgwin, 2013). In April 2015, an international cybersquad took down 
the Beebone botnet, made up of 12,000 computers that had been infecting about 
30,000 computers a month around the world via drive-by downloads with Changeup, 
a polymorphic worm used to distribute Trojans, worms, backdoors, and other types 
of malware (Constantin, 2015). In 2015, the FBI and British police were also able to 
stop a botnet that had stolen over $10 million from banks (Pagliery, 2015). As a result 
of efforts such as these, the number of bots has significantly declined, especially in 
the United States (Symantec, 2016).
Malicious code is a threat at both the client and the server levels, although servers 
generally engage in much more thorough anti-virus activities than do consumers. At

the server level, malicious code can bring down an entire website, preventing millions 
of people from using the site. Such incidents are infrequent. Much more frequent 
malicious code attacks occur at the client level, and the damage can quickly spread 
to millions of other computers connected to the Internet. Table 5.4 lists some well-
known examples of malicious code.

POTENTIALLY UNWANTED PROGRAMS (PUPS)
In addition to malicious code, the e-commerce security environment is further chal-
lenged by potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) such as adware, browser para-
sites, spyware, and other applications that install themselves on a computer, such as 
rogue security software, toolbars, and PC diagnostic tools, typically without the user’s 
informed consent. Such programs are increasingly found on social network and user-
generated content sites where users are fooled into downloading them. Once installed, 
these applications are usually exceedingly difficult to remove from the computer. One 
example of a PUP is System Doctor, which infects PCs running Windows operating 
systems. System Doctor poses as a legitimate anti-spyware program when in fact it is 
malware that, when installed, disables the user’s security software, alters the user’s 
web browser, and diverts users to scam websites where more malware is downloaded.
Adware is typically used to call for pop-up ads to display when the user visits 
certain sites. While annoying, adware is not typically used for criminal activities. A 
browser parasite is a program that can monitor and change the settings of a user’s 
browser, for instance, changing the browser’s home page, or sending information about 
the sites visited to a remote computer. Browser parasites are often a component of 
adware. In early 2015, Lenovo faced a barrage of criticism when it became known that, 
since September 2014, it had been shipping its Windows laptops with Superfish adware 
preinstalled. Superfish injected its own shopping results into the computer’s browser 
when the user searched on Google, Amazon, or other websites. In the process, Super-
fish created a security risk by enabling others on a Wi-Fi network to silently hijack the 
browser and collect anything typed into it. Lenovo ultimately issued a removal tool 
to enable customers to delete the adware. Microsoft and legitimate security firms have 
redefined adware programs to be malware and discourage manufacturers from ship-
ping products with adware programs (Loeb, 2016).
Spyware, on the other hand, can be used to obtain information such as a user’s 
keystrokes, copies of e-mail and instant messages, and even take screenshots (and 
thereby capture passwords or other confidential data). 
PHISHING
Social engineering relies on human curiosity, greed, and gullibility in order to trick 
people into taking an action that will result in the downloading of malware. Kevin 
Mitnick, until his capture and imprisonment in 1999, was one of America’s most 
wanted computer criminals. Mitnick used simple deceptive techniques to obtain pass-
words, social security, and police records all without the use of any sophisticated 
technology (Mitnick, 2011).
Phishing is any deceptive, online attempt by a third party to obtain confidential 
information for financial gain. Phishing attacks typically do not involve malicious code 
but instead rely on straightforward misrepresentation and fraud, so-called “social engi-
neering” techniques. One of the most popular phishing attacks is the e-mail scam 
letter. The scam begins with an e-mail: a rich former oil minister of Nigeria is seeking 
a bank account to stash millions of dollars for a short period of time, and requests your 
bank account number where the money can be deposited. In return, you will receive

a million dollars. This type of e-mail scam is popularly known as a “Nigerian letter” 
scam (see Figure 5.4).
Thousands of other phishing attacks use other scams, some pretending to be 
eBay, PayPal, or Citibank writing to you for account verification (known as spear 
phishing, or targeting a known customer of a specific bank or other type of busi-
ness). Click on a link in the e-mail and you will be taken to a website controlled by 
the scammer, and prompted to enter confidential information about your accounts, 
such as your account number and PIN codes. On any given day, millions of these 
phishing attack e-mails are sent, and, unfortunately, some people are fooled and 
disclose their personal account information.
Phishers rely on traditional “con man” tactics, but use e-mail to trick recipients 
into voluntarily giving up financial access codes, bank account numbers, credit card 
numbers, and other personal information. Often, phishers create (or “spoof”) a website 
that purports to be a legitimate financial institution and cons users into entering finan-
cial information, or the site downloads malware such as a keylogger to the victim’s 
computer. Phishers use the information they gather to commit fraudulent acts such 
as charging items to your credit cards or withdrawing funds from your bank account, 
or in other ways “steal your identity” (identity fraud). Symantec reported that in 2015, 
about 1 in every 1,875 e-mails contained a phishing attack. The number of spear-
phishing campaigns in 2015 increased by 55%, but the number of attacks, recipients 
within each campaign, and the average duration of the campaign all declined, indi-

cating that perpetrators are becoming stealthier about them, since campaigns that 
target fewer recipients and are smaller and shorter are less likely to arouse suspicion. 
In 2015, according to Symantec, 43% of spear-phishing e-mails were directed at small 
businesses with less than 250 employees, and 35% of large organizations reported they 
were targeted in spear-phishing campaigns (Symantec, 2016). According to Verizon, 
30% of phishing emails were opened by their targets, and 12% were clicked on to open 
attachments (Verizon, 2016). 
To combat phishing, in January 2012, leading e-mail service providers, including 
Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and AOL, as well as financial services companies such as 
PayPal, Bank of America, and others, joined together to form DMARC.org, an orga-
nization aimed at dramatically reducing e-mail address spoofing, in which attackers 
use real e-mail addresses to send phishing e-mails to victims who may be deceived 
because the e-mail appears to originate from a source the receiver trusts. DMARC 
offers a method of authenticating the origin of the e-mail and allows receivers to quar-
antine, report, or reject messages that fall to pass its test. Yahoo and AOL have reported 
significant success against email fraud as a result of using DMARC, and, effective as 
of June 2016, Google joined them in implementing a stricter version of DMARC, in 
which e-mail that fails DMARC authentication checks will be rejected (Vijayan, 2015).
HACKING, CYBERVANDALISM, AND HACKTIVISM
A hacker is an individual who intends to gain unauthorized access to a computer 
system. Within the hacking community, the term cracker is typically used to denote 
a hacker with criminal intent, although in the public press, the terms hacker and 
cracker tend to be used interchangeably. Hackers and crackers gain unauthorized 
access by finding weaknesses in the security procedures of websites and computer 
systems, often taking advantage of various features of the Internet that make it an 
open system that is easy to use. In the past, hackers and crackers typically were com-
puter aficionados excited by the challenge of breaking into corporate and government 
websites. Sometimes they were satisfied merely by breaking into the files of an e-com-
merce site. Today, hackers have malicious intentions to disrupt, deface, or destroy 
sites (cybervandalism) or to steal personal or corporate information they can use for 
financial gain (data breach).
Hacktivism adds a political twist. Hacktivists typically attack governments, orga-
nizations, and even individuals for political purposes, employing the tactics of cyber-
vandalism, distributed denial of service attacks, data thefts, and doxing (gathering and 
exposing personal information of public figures, typically from emails, social network 
posts, and other documents). The most prominent hacktivist organization is Wikileaks, 
founded by Julian Assange and others, which released documents and e-mails of the 
U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Defense, and Democratic National Com-
mittee in 2016. LulzSec and Anonymous are two other prominent hacktivist groups. 
In 2015, another hacktivist group called the Impact Team allegedly hacked the Ashley 
Madison website to call attention to its weak security, and after its owner Avid Life 
Media refused to shut it down as they demanded, the group released millions of sen-
sitive customer records. See the Insight on Society case study, The Ashley Madison Data 
Breach, for a more in-depth look at implications of this high-profile hack.

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
THE ASHLEY MADISON DATA BREACH
As the Internet continues to per-
meate even the most intimate aspects 
of our lives, the stigma attached to 
online dating has largely disappeared. 
Online dating has grown into a $2.2 
billion industry annually in the United 
States, led by companies like eHarmony, OKCupid, 
and Match. There are also a number of smaller 
niche sites that cater to people with more spe-
cific interests or lifestyles. One such site is Ashley 
Madison. 
Based in Canada and launched in 2001 by its 
parent company, Avid Life Media, Ashley Madison 
specifically markets itself to people in marriages 
or committed relationships, which has earned the 
site a tawdry reputation. Users purchase credits, 
rather than a monthly subscription, and then 
redeem the credits to participate in conversations 
with other members, which can be through mes-
sages or real-time chat. Women are not charged 
money to create a profile on the site, nor are they 
charged to send or receive messages, while men 
are charged for both. Even with those incentives, 
the ratio of men to women on the site skews dra-
matically toward men, which led Ashley Madison 
to create fictitious female profiles to create the 
appearance of balance. 
The perception of secrecy is critical for pro-
spective users of Ashley Madison. But in 2015, 
that veil of secrecy came crashing down. The site 
was hacked by a group known as The Impact 
Team, which stated that its motivations were to 
harm the site and its unethical business model, as 
well as to protest the site’s use of a $19 data dele-
tion fee for users seeking to close their accounts. 
The Impact Team stated that after creating a plan 
to make an undetectable breach, they discovered 
they were easily able to access the entire cache 
of company data. They released the data in two 
batches of 10 and 12 gigabytes, and the data is 
now easily searchable on the Web. Names, street 
addresses, and dates of birth were all stolen and 
made public, as well as other personal informa-
tion. They also stole company documents, includ-
ing the e-mails of CEO Noel Biderman, many of 
which caused further damage to the company’s 
shattered reputation. For example, Biderman’s 
e-mails revealed that the CTO of Ashley Madison 
had hacked a competitor’s database, revealing 
key security flaws (perhaps he should have been 
paying more attention to his own company’s secu-
rity systems). Partial credit card information of 
Ashley Madison users was also leaked, but not 
enough for identity thieves to use. 
Demographic information gleaned from the 
data dump shows that of the site’s 36 million 
users, 31 million were males, but only 10 million 
actively used the site. The other 5 million profiles 
were female, but less than 2,500 of those were 
involved in chats with other users, suggesting that 
fake female profiles were the overwhelming major-
ity of female profiles on the site. A full third of 
the accounts on the site were created with dummy 
e-mail addresses. North Americans had the highest 
number of accounts as a percentage of population, 
with the United States coming in at 5.1%. E-mail 
addresses associated with government accounts 
were well-represented, as were big banks, large 
tech companies, and other high-powered industries. 
This stands in stark demographic contrast to a 
service like Tinder, which consists of much younger 
members; Ashley Madison users tended to be more 
established financially and willing to pay for what 
they perceived to be a discreet and upscale service. 
After the hack, researchers found that companies 
with a disproportionately high number of Ashley 
Madison members took bigger financial risks and 
had poor scores in corporate responsibility. 
Ashley Madison’s own corporate profile sug-
gests risk-taking of its own. How could a site

that advertises the ability to discreetly 
have an affair allow its data to be breached 
and stolen so easily? Security experts review-
ing Ashley Madison’s setup claimed that the 
site lacked even simplistic security measures. 
For example, all of the data belonging to users 
who paid the $19 data deletion fee persisted 
on Ashley Madison servers and was obtained 
in the hack. Additionally, none of the data was 
encrypted. Encryption would have incurred hefty 
additional expense for the company, but it might 
have saved it considerable embarrassment during 
a breach like this one.
Most data breaches allow criminals to engage 
in identity theft and other types of online fraud. 
But in this case, the Ashley Madison hack has 
even more significant ramifications on the per-
sonal lives of its users. There are already mul-
tiple reported incidents of suicides committed 
by former users, and a handful of notable public 
figures have been publicly embarrassed by the 
release of their profile data. The hack has the 
potential to ruin the marriages and personal lives 
of thousands of people. Although many of Ashley 
Madison’s users were engaged in infidelity, these 
people were still the victims of a crime and an 
invasion of privacy that goes beyond typical data 
breaches. Spammers and blackmailers have used 
the now-public data to extort users, demanding 
Bitcoin in exchange for silence and threatening 
to share Ashley Madison data with users’ families 
and social media contacts. 
As a result of the hack, Biderman quickly 
stepped down from his post as CEO, and in 2016 
a new executive team was installed and immedi-
ately began distancing themselves from the previ-
ous regime. Going forward, the revelations about 
fake profiles, impending lawsuits, and overall 
negative coverage of the breach will likely derail 
plans for growth. Ashley Madison had already 
struggled to market its business and raise funds 
in the past, despite its very solid financial profile. 
The company had been growing so fast that Bider-
man had started investigating launching an IPO in 
England to fuel its expansion. Not only are those 
plans on hold indefinitely, but the Federal Trade 
Commission has begun investigating Ashley Madi-
son’s usage of bots and other fake profiles. Ashley 
Madison has also begun to receive what may 
become a barrage of lawsuits alleging negligence 
and personal damages, though many potential 
plaintiffs may be unwilling to reveal their identi-
ties, which they must do to be included in any suit 
after a judge ruled in 2016 that plaintiffs could 
not use aliases such as John Doe. And the results 
of a joint investigation by the Canadian and Aus-
tralian governments completed in 2016 confirmed 
that the company had fabricated a “trusted secu-
rity award” displayed on its homepage. The inves-
tigation also confirmed the company’s failure to 
delete profile information of users who canceled 
their accounts.
Despite the turmoil, the company estimates 
that its membership base has actually grown over 
the past year. However, a third-party analysis 
showed that traffic to the site has dropped by 82% 
since the breach, calling the site’s self-reported 
numbers into question.

Groups of hackers called tiger teams are sometimes used by corporate security 
departments to test their own security measures. By hiring hackers to break into the 
system from the outside, the company can identify weaknesses in the computer sys-
tem’s armor. These “good hackers” became known as white hats because of their role 
in helping organizations locate and fix security flaws. White hats do their work under 
contract, with agreement from the target firms that they will not be prosecuted for 
their efforts to break in. Hardware and software firms such as Apple and Microsoft 
pay bounties of $25,000 to $200,000 to white hat hackers for discovering bugs in their 
software and hardware (Perlroth, 2016).
In contrast, black hats are hackers who engage in the same kinds of activities 
but without pay or any buy-in from the targeted organization, and with the intention 
of causing harm. They break into websites and reveal the confidential or proprietary 
information they find. These hackers believe strongly that information should be free, 
so sharing previously secret information is part of their mission.
Somewhere in the middle are the grey hats, hackers who believe they are pursu-
ing some greater good by breaking in and revealing system flaws. Grey hats discover 
weaknesses in a system’s security, and then publish the weakness without disrupting 
the site or attempting to profit from their finds. Their only reward is the prestige of 
discovering the weakness. Grey hat actions are suspect, however, especially when the 
hackers reveal security flaws that make it easier for other criminals to gain access to 
a system.
DATA BREACHES
A data breach occurs whenever organizations lose control over corporate information 
to outsiders. According to Symantec, the total number of data breaches in 2015 grew by 
only 2% compared to 2014, which was a record year for breaches. There were nine 
mega-breaches in 2015, up from eight in 2014. The total identities exposed reached 429 
million, up 23%, with over 190 million identities exposed in a single breach (Symantec, 
2016). The Identity Theft Resource Center is another organization that tracks data 
breaches. It recorded 780 breaches in 2015, the second highest total on record. Breaches 
involving the medical/healthcare industry had the highest impact, representing 35% 
of all breaches and almost 70% of all records exposed. Hackers were the leading cause 
of data breaches, responsible for almost 40% of breaches, followed by employee error/
negligence (15%), accidental e-mail/Internet exposure (14%) and insider theft (11%). 
The number of breaches involving social security numbers involved almost 165 million 
people (Identity Theft Resource Center, 2016). Among the high profile breaches that 
occurred in 2015 were those affecting the Office of Personnel Management and the 
Internal Revenue Service, as well as others against health-care insurers such as Anthem 
and Premera, retailers such as CVS and Walgreens, and the credit rating agency 
Experian. In 2016, the trend has continued with the Yahoo data breach, which is 
believed to be the largest breach at a single company in history, exposing the records 
of 500 million. Compared to others like Google and Microsoft, Yahoo management was 
reportedly slow to invest in security measures (Perlroth and Goel, 2016).

CREDIT CARD FRAUD/THEFT
Theft of credit card data is one of the most feared occurrences on the Internet. 
Fear that credit card information will be stolen prevents users from making online 
purchases in many cases. Interestingly, this fear appears to be largely unfounded. 
Incidences of stolen credit card information are actually much lower than users 
think, around 0.8% of all online card transactions (CyberSource, 2016). Online 
merchants use a variety of techniques to combat credit card fraud, including using 
automated fraud detection tools, manually reviewing orders, rejection of suspect 
orders, and requiring additional levels of security such as email address, zip code, 
and CCV security codes. 
In addition, federal law limits the liability of individuals to $50 for a stolen credit 
card. For amounts more than $50, the credit card company generally pays the amount, 
although in some cases, the merchant may be held liable if it failed to verify the 
account or consult published lists of invalid cards. Banks recoup the cost of credit card 
fraud by charging higher interest rates on unpaid balances, and by merchants who 
raise prices to cover the losses. In 2016, the U.S. credit card system is in the midst of 
a shift to EMV credit cards, also known as smart cards or chip cards. Already widely 
used in Europe, EMV credit cards have a computer chip instead of a magnetic strip 
that can be easily copied by hackers and sold as dump data (see Table 5.2). While EMV 
technology cannot prevent data breaches from occurring, the hope is that it will make 
it harder for criminals to profit from the mass theft of credit card numbers that could 
be used in commerce. 
In the past, the most common cause of credit card fraud was a lost or stolen card 
that was used by someone else, followed by employee theft of customer numbers and 
stolen identities (criminals applying for credit cards using false identities). Today, the 
most frequent cause of stolen cards and card information is the systematic hacking 
and looting of a corporate server where the information on millions of credit card 
purchases is stored. For instance, in 2010, Albert Gonzalez was sentenced to 20 years 
in prison for organizing one of the largest thefts of credit card numbers in American 
history. Along with several Russian co-conspirators, Gonzalez broke into the central 
computer systems of TJX, BJ’s, Barnes & Noble, and other companies, stealing over 
160 million card numbers and costing these firms over $200 million in losses (Fox 
and Botelho, 2013).
International orders have a much higher risk of being fraudulent, with fraud losses 
twice those of domestic orders. If an international customer places an order and then 
later disputes it, online merchants often have no way to verify that the package was 
actually delivered and that the credit card holder is the person who placed the order. 
As a result, most online merchants will not process international orders.
A central security issue of e-commerce is the difficulty of establishing the cus-
tomer’s identity. Currently there is no technology that can identify a person with 
absolute certainty. For instance, a lost or stolen EMV card can be used until the card 
is cancelled, just like a magnetic strip card. Until a customer’s identity can be guaran-
teed, online companies are at a higher risk of loss than traditional offline companies. 
The federal government has attempted to address this issue through the Electronic 
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (the “E-Sign” law), which gives digital 

signatures the same authority as hand-written signatures in commerce. This law also 
intended to make digital signatures more commonplace and easier to use. Although the 
use of e-signatures is still uncommon in the B2C retail e-commerce arena, many busi-
nesses are starting to implement e-signature solutions, particularly for B2B contracting, 
financial services, insurance, health care, and government and professional services. 
DocuSign, Adobe eSign, RightSignature, and Silanis eSignLive are currently among the 
most widely adopted e-signature solutions. They use a variety of techniques, such as 
remote user identification through third-party databases or personal information veri-
fication such as a photo of a driver’s license; multi-factor user authentication methods 
(user ID and password, e-mail address verification, secret question and answer); and 
public/private key encryption to create a digital signature and embedded audit trail 
that can be used to verify the e-signature’s integrity (Silanis Technology, 2014). The 
use of fingerprint identification is also one solution to positive identification, but the 
database of print information can be hacked. Mobile e-signature solutions are also 
beginning to be adopted (DocuSign, 2015).
IDENTITY FRAUD
Identity fraud involves the unauthorized use of another person’s personal data, such 
as social security, driver’s license, and/or credit card numbers, as well as user names 
and passwords, for illegal financial benefit. Criminals can use such data to obtain loans, 
purchase merchandise, or obtain other services, such as mobile phone or other utility 
services. Cybercriminals employ many of the techniques described previously, such 
as spyware, phishing, data breaches, and credit card theft, for the purpose of identity 
fraud. Data breaches, in particular, often lead to identity fraud. 
Identity fraud is a significant problem in the United States. In 2015, according to 
Javelin Strategy & Research, 13 million U.S. consumers suffered identity fraud. The 
total dollar losses as a result of identity fraud were approximately $15 billion (Javelin 
Research & Strategy, 2016). 
SPOOFING, PHARMING, AND SPAM (JUNK) WEBSITES
Spoofing involves attempting to hide a true identity by using someone else’s e-mail 
or IP address. For instance, a spoofed e-mail will have a forged sender e-mail address 
designed to mislead the receiver about who sent the e-mail. IP spoofing involves the 
creation of TCP/IP packets that use someone else’s source IP address, indicating that 
the packets are coming from a trusted host. Most current routers and firewalls can 
offer protection against IP spoofing. Spoofing a website sometimes involves pharm-
ing, automatically redirecting a web link to an address different from the intended 
one, with the site masquerading as the intended destination. Links that are designed 
to lead to one site can be reset to send users to a totally unrelated site—one that ben-
efits the hacker.
Although spoofing and pharming do not directly damage files or network servers, 
they threaten the integrity of a site. For example, if hackers redirect customers to a 
fake website that looks almost exactly like the true site, they can then collect and 
process orders, effectively stealing business from the true site. Or, if the intent is to 
disrupt rather than steal, hackers can alter orders—inflating them or changing prod-

ucts ordered—and then send them on to the true site for processing and delivery. 
Customers become dissatisfied with the improper order shipment, and the company 
may have huge inventory fluctuations that impact its operations.
In addition to threatening integrity, spoofing also threatens authenticity by making 
it difficult to discern the true sender of a message. Clever hackers can make it almost 
impossible to distinguish between a true and a fake identity or web address.
Spam (junk) websites (also sometimes referred to as link farms) are a little dif-
ferent. These are sites that promise to offer some product or service, but in fact are 
just a collection of advertisements for other sites, some of which contain malicious 
code. For instance, you may search for “[name of town] weather,” and then click on a 
link that promises your local weather, but then discover that all the site does is display 
ads for weather-related products or other websites. Junk or spam websites typically 
appear on search results, and do not involve e-mail. These sites cloak their identities 
by using domain names similar to legitimate firm names, and redirect traffic to known 
spammer-redirection domains such as topsearch10.com.
SNIFFING AND MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE ATTACKS
A sniffer is a type of eavesdropping program that monitors information traveling over 
a network. When used legitimately, sniffers can help identify potential network trou-
ble-spots, but when used for criminal purposes, they can be damaging and very dif-
ficult to detect. Sniffers enable hackers to steal proprietary information from anywhere 
on a network, including passwords, e-mail messages, company files, and confidential 
reports. For instance, in 2013, five hackers were charged in another worldwide hacking 
scheme that targeted the corporate networks of retail chains such as 7-Eleven and the 
French retailer Carrefour SA, using sniffer programs to steal more than 160 million 
credit card numbers (Voreacos, 2013).
E-mail wiretaps are a variation on the sniffing threat. An e-mail wiretap is a method 
for recording or journaling e-mail traffic generally at the mail server level from any 
individual. E-mail wiretaps are used by employers to track employee messages, and by 
government agencies to surveil individuals or groups. E-mail wiretaps can be installed 
on servers and client computers. The USA PATRIOT Act permits the FBI to compel 
ISPs to install a black box on their mail servers that can impound the e-mail of a single 
person or group of persons for later analysis. In the case of American citizens commu-
nicating with other citizens, an FBI agent or government lawyer need only certify to a 
judge on the secret 11-member U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) that 
the information sought is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation to get permis-
sion to install the program. Judges have no discretion. They must approve wiretaps 
based on government agents’ unsubstantiated assertions. In the case of suspected 
terrorist activity, law enforcement does not have to inform a court prior to installing 
a wire or e-mail tap. A 2007 amendment to the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance 
Act, known as FISA, provided new powers to the National Security Agency to monitor 
international e-mail and telephone communications where one person is in the United 
States, and where the purpose of such interception is to collect foreign intelligence 
(Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978; Protect America Act of 2007). The FISA 
Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2012 extends the provisions of FISA for five more 
spam (junk) websites 
also referred to as link 
farms; promise to offer 
products or services, but in 
fact are just collections of 
advertisements

years, until 2017. NSA’s XKeyscore program, revealed by Edward Snowden, is a form of 
“wiretap” that allows NSA analysts to search through vast databases containing not only 
e-mail, but online chats, and browsing histories of millions of individuals (Wills, 2013).
The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) requires all 
communications carriers (including ISPs) to provide near-instant access to law enforce-
ment agencies to their message traffic. Many Internet services (such as Facebook and 
Linked­In) that have built-in ISP services technically are not covered by CALEA. One 
can only assume these non-ISP e-mail operators cooperate with law enforcement. 
Unlike the past where wiretaps required many hours to physically tap into phone 
lines, in today’s digital phone systems, taps are arranged in a few minutes by the large 
carriers at their expense. 
A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack also involves eavesdropping but is more 
active than a sniffing attack, which typically involves passive monitoring. In a MitM 
attack, the attacker is able to intercept communications between two parties who 
believe they are directly communicating with one another, when in fact the attacker 
is controlling the communications. This allows the attacker to change the contents of 
the communication.
DENIAL OF SERVICE (DOS) AND DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE (DDOS) 
ATTACKS
In a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, hackers flood a website with useless pings or 
page requests that inundate and overwhelm the site’s web servers. Increasingly, DoS 
attacks involve the use of bot networks and so-called “distributed attacks” built from 
thousands of compromised client computers. DoS attacks typically cause a website to 
shut down, making it impossible for users to access the site. For busy e-commerce 
sites, these attacks are costly; while the site is shut down, customers cannot make 
purchases. And the longer a site is shut down, the more damage is done to a site’s 
reputation. Although such attacks do not destroy information or access restricted areas 
of the server, they can destroy a firm’s online business. Often, DoS attacks are accom-
panied by attempts at blackmailing site owners to pay tens or hundreds of thousands 
of dollars to the hackers in return for stopping the DoS attack.
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack uses hundreds or even thou-
sands of computers to attack the target network from numerous launch points. DoS 
and DDoS attacks are threats to a system’s operation because they can shut it down 
indefinitely. Major websites have experienced such attacks, making the companies 
aware of their vulnerability and the need to continually introduce new measures to 
prevent future attacks. According to Akamai, the number of DDoS attacks in the 2nd 
quarter of 2016 increased by about 130% compared to the same period in 2015. One 
new technique increasingly being used targets insecure routers and other home devices 
such as webcams that use UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) to amplify the attacks 
(Akamai, 2016a). With the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), billions of Internet-
connected things from refrigerators to security cameras can be used to launch service 
requests against servers. In October 2016, a large scale DDoS attack using Internet 
devices such as these was launched against an Internet domain resolving firm, Dyn.

country were affected. Hackers were able to guess the administrator passwords of 
common devices (often set to factory defaults like admin, or 12345), and then insert 
instructions to launch an attack against Dyn servers (Sanger and Perlroth, 2016). DDoS 
attacks are typically isolated to a single firm, but in the Dyn attack, the firm attacked 
happened to be one of the switchboards for a large part of the Internet in the United 
States. In another measure of the prevalence of DDoS attacks, in an Arbor Networks 
survey of 354 ISP and network operators around the world, respondents noted that 
DDoS attacks against customers constituted the number one operational threat, with 
over 50% of respondents experiencing DDoS attacks during the survey period. Arbor 
Networks also reported that the size of reported DDoS attacks in terms of bandwidth 
consumed continued to increase in 2015, with attackers using reflection/amplification 
techniques to create attacks reaching 500 Gpbs (Arbor Networks, 2016). Another trend 
is DDoS smokescreening, in which attackers use DDoS as a distraction while they also 
insert malware or viruses or steal data. A 2016 survey of 760 security and IT profes-
sionals in companies in North America and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa con-
ducted by Neustar found that 45% reported that a virus or malware was installed as a 
result of the DDoS attack, while 57% also experienced a theft of data or funds (Neustar, 
2016). And not surprisingly, now that mobile data connections have become faster and 
more stable, hackers are beginning to harness mobile devices for mobile-based DDoS 
attacks. A recent attack originating from China used malicious ads loaded inside mobile 
apps and mobile browesrs as the attack mechanism (Majkowski, 2015). 
China also appears to have been behind another major DDoS attack in 2015 against 
the software development platform GitHub, aimed specifically at two Chinese anti-
censorship projects hosted on the platform. Researchers say the attack was an example 
of a new tool they have nicknamed the Great Cannon. Although originally thought 
to be part of China’s Great Firewall censorship system, further investigation revealed 
that the Great Cannon is a separate distinct offensive system that is co-located with 
the Great Firewall. The Great Cannon enables hackers to hijack traffic to individual 
IP addresses and uses a man-in-the-middle attack to replace unencrypted content 
between a web server and the user with malicious Javascript that would load the two 
GitHub project pages every two seconds (Kirk, 2015b; Essers, 2015).
INSIDER ATTACKS
We tend to think of security threats to a business as originating outside the organiza-
tion. In fact, the largest financial threats to business institutions come not from rob-
beries but from embezzlement by insiders. Bank employees steal far more money than 
bank robbers. The same is true for e-commerce sites. Some of the largest disruptions to 
service, destruction to sites, and diversion of customer credit data and personal infor-
mation have come from insiders—once trusted employees. Employees have access to 
privileged information, and, in the presence of sloppy internal security procedures, 
they are often able to roam throughout an organization’s systems without leaving a 
trace. Research from Carnegie Mellon University documents the significant damage 
insiders have done to both private and public organizations (Software Engineering 
Institute, 2012). Survey results also indicate that insiders are more likely to be the 
source of cyberattacks than outsiders, and to cause more damage to an organization 

than external attacks (PWC, 2015). In some instances, the insider might not have 
criminal intent, but inadvertently exposes data that can then be exploited by others. 
For instance, a Ponemon Institute study found that negligent insiders are a top cause 
of data breaches (Ponemon Institute, 2015b). Another study based on an analysis 
of the behavior of 10 million users during 2015 estimated that 1% of employees are 
responsible for 75% of cloud-related enterprise security risk, by reusing or sending 
out plain-text passwords, indiscriminately sharing fiiles, using risky applications, or 
accidentally downloading malware or clicking phishing links (Korolov, 2015).
POORLY DESIGNED SOFTWARE
Many security threats prey on poorly designed software, sometimes in the operating 
system and sometimes in the application software, including browsers. The increase 
in complexity and size of software programs, coupled with demands for timely deliv-
ery to markets, has contributed to an increase in software flaws or vulnerabilities that 
hackers can exploit. For instance, SQL injection attacks take advantage of vulnera-
bilities in poorly coded web application software that fails to properly validate or filter 
data entered by a user on a web page to introduce malicious program code into a 
company’s systems and networks. An attacker can use this input validation error to 
send a rogue SQL query to the underlying database to access the database, plant mali-
cious code, or access other systems on the network. Large web applications have 
hundreds of places for inputting user data, each of which creates an opportunity for 
an SQL injection attack. A large number of web-facing applications are believed to 
have SQL injection vulnerabilities, and tools are available for hackers to check web 
applications for these vulnerabilities.
Each year, security firms identify thousands of software vulnerabilities in Internet 
browsers, PC, Macintosh, and Linux software, as well as mobile device operating 
systems and applications. According to Microsoft, vulnerability disclosures across the 
software industry in the second half of 2015 increased by 9% compared to the same 
period in 2014. Over 3,300 vulnerabilities were identified (Microsoft, 2016). Browser 
vulnerabilities in particular are a popular target, as well as browser plug-ins such as 
for Adobe Reader. A zero-day vulnerability is one that has been previously unre-
ported and for which no patch yet exists. In 2015, 54 zero-day vulnerabilities were 
reported, up from 24 in 2014 (Symantec, 2016). The very design of the personal com-
puter includes many open communication ports that can be used, and indeed are 
designed to be used, by external computers to send and receive messages. Ports that 
are frequently attacked include TCP port 445 (Microsoft-DS), port 80 (WWW/HTTP), 
and 443 (SSL/HTTPS). Given their complexity and design objectives, all operating 
systems and application software, including Linux and Macintosh, have vulnerabilities. 
In 2014, a flaw in the OpenSSL encryption system, used by millions of websites, 
known as the Heartbleed bug, was discovered (see Section 5.3 for a further discussion 
of SSL). The vulnerability allowed hackers to decrypt an SSL session and discover user 
names, passwords, and other user data, by using OpenSSL in combination with a com-
munications protocol called the RFC6520 heartbeat that helps a remote user remain in 
touch after connecting with a website server. In the process a small chunk of the serv-
er’s memory content can leak out (hence the name heartbleed), potentially large

enough to hold a password or encryption key that would allow a hacker to exploit the 
server further. The Heartbleed bug also affected over 1,300 Android apps. Later in 2014, 
another vulnerability known as ShellShock or BashBug that affected most versions of 
Linux and Unix, as well as Mac OS X, was revealed. ShellShock enabled attackers to 
use CGI (see Chapter 4) to add malicious commands (Symantec, 2015). In 2015, 
researchers announced that they had discovered a new SSL/TLS vulnerability that they 
named FREAK (Factoring Attack on RSA-Export Keys) that allows man-in-the-middle 
attacks that enable the interception and decryption of encrypted communications 
between clients and servers, which would then allow the attackers to steal passwords 
and other personal information. More than 60% of encrypted websites were reportedly 
open to attack via this security vulnerability, including those for the White House, the 
FBI, and the National Security Agency (Hackett, 2015; Vaughan-Nichols, 2015). A recent 
study found over 1,200 of the largest firms’ websites have not fixed the problem entirely. 
SOCIAL NETWORK SECURITY ISSUES
Social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Tumblr provide a 
rich and rewarding environment for hackers. Viruses, site takeovers, identity fraud, 
malware-loaded apps, click hijacking, phishing, and spam are all found on social net-
works. According to Symantec, the most common type of scam on social media sites 
in 2015 were manual sharing scams, where victims unwittingly shared videos, stories, 
and pictures that included links to malicious sites. Fake offerings that invite victims 
to join a fake event or group with incentives such as free gift cards and that require 
a user to share his or her information with the attacker were another common tech-
nique. Other techniques include fake Like buttons that, when clicked, install malware 
and post updates to the user’s Newsfeed, further spreading the attack, and fake apps 
(Symantec, 2016). By sneaking in among our friends, hackers can masquerade as 
friends and dupe users into scams. 
Social network firms have thus far been relatively poor policemen because they 
have failed to aggressively weed out accounts that send visitors to malware sites 
(unlike Google, which maintains a list of known malware sites and patrols its search 
results looking for links to malware sites). Social networks are open: anyone can set 
up a personal page, even criminals. Most attacks are social engineering attacks that 
tempt visitors to click on links that sound reasonable. Social apps downloaded from 
either the social network or a foreign site are not certified by the social network to be 
clean of malware. It’s “clicker beware.”
MOBILE PLATFORM SECURITY ISSUES
The explosion in mobile devices has broadened opportunities for hackers. Mobile 
users are filling their devices with personal and financial information, and using them 
to conduct an increasing number of transactions, from retail purchases to mobile 
banking, making them excellent targets for hackers. In general, mobile devices face 
all the same risks as any Internet device as well as some new risks associated with 
wireless network security. For instance, public Wi-Fi networks that are not secured 
are very susceptible to hacking. While most PC users are aware their computers and 
websites may be hacked and contain malware, most cell phone users believe their cell 

phone is as secure as a traditional landline phone. As with social network members, 
mobile users are prone to think they are in a shared, trustworthy environment.
Mobile cell phone malware (sometimes referred to as malicious mobile apps (MMAs) 
or rogue mobile apps) was developed as early as 2004 with Cabir, a Bluetooth worm affect-
ing Symbian operating systems (Nokia phones) and causing the phone to continuously 
seek out other Bluetooth-enabled devices, quickly draining the battery. The iKee.B worm, 
first discovered in 2009, only two years after the iPhone was introduced, infected jailbro-
ken iPhones, turning the phones into botnet-controlled devices. An iPhone in Europe 
could be hacked by an iPhone in the United States, and all its private data sent to a server 
in Poland. IKee.B established the feasibility of cell phone botnets. 
In 2015, Symantec analyzed 10 million apps and found 3 million were malware. 
Symantec expects the growth in mobile malware to continue in 2016 and become 
more aggressive in targeting mobile payment and mobile banking applications. The 
majority of mobile malware still targets the Android platform. For instance, Syman-
tec has already discovered Android malware that can intercept text messages with 
bank authentication codes and forward them to attackers, as well as fake versions of 
legitimate mobile banking applications. However, the Apple iPhone platform is begin-
ning to be increasingly targeted as well, and in 2015, Chinese hackers infected Xcode, 
Apple’s integrated suite of development tools for creating iOS appps, and as a result, 
unsuspecting Chinese iOS developers unknowingly created thousands of apps with the 
malicious code (Keizer, 2015). And it is not just rogue applications that are dangerous, 
but also popular legitimate applications that simply have little protection from hackers. 
For instance, in 2014, security researchers revealed that the Starbucks mobile app, the 
most used mobile payment app in the United States, was storing user names, e-mail 
addresses, and passwords in clear text, in such a way that anyone with access to the 
phone could see the passwords and user names by connecting the phone to a computer. 
According to researchers, Starbucks erred in emphasizing convenience and ease of use 
in the design of the app over security concerns (Schuman, 2014).
Vishing attacks target gullible cell phone users with verbal messages to call a 
certain number and, for example, donate money to starving children in Haiti. Smish-
ing attacks exploit SMS/text messages. Compromised text messages can contain e-mail 
and website addresses that can lead the innocent user to a malware site. Criminal 
SMS spoofing services have emerged, which conceal the cybercriminal’s true phone 
number, replacing it with a false alpha-numeric name. SMS spoofing can also be used 
by cybercriminals to lure mobile users to a malicious website by sending a text that 
appears to be from a legitimate organization in the From field, and suggesting the 
receiver click on a malicious URL hyperlink to update an account or obtain a gift card. 
A small number of downloaded apps from app stores have also contained malware. 
Madware—innocent-looking apps that contain adware that launches pop-up ads and 
text messages on your mobile device—is also becoming an increasing problem. An 
examination of 3 million apps in 2015 that Symantec classified as grayware (programs 
that do not contain viruses and are not overtly malicious, but which can be annoy-
ing or harmful) found that 2.3 million of those ads were madware (Symantec, 2016).

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
THINK YOUR SMARTPHONE IS SECURE?
So far, there have been few publicly 
identified, large-scale, smartphone 
security breaches, but just because 
it hasn’t happened yet doesn’t mean 
it won’t. With about 210 million smart-
phone users in the United States, business 
firms increasingly switching their employees to 
the mobile platform, and consumers using their 
phones for financial transactions and paying bills, 
the size and richness of the smartphone target 
for hackers is growing.
Many users believe their smartphones 
are unlikely to be hacked because Apple and 
Google are protecting them from malware, and 
that Verizon and AT&T can keep the cell phone 
network secure just as they do the land-line phone 
system. Telephone systems are “closed” and there-
fore not subject to the kinds of attacks that occur 
on the open Internet. 
But hackers can do to a smartphone just 
about anything they can do to any Internet device: 
request malicious files without user intervention, 
delete files, transmit files, install programs running 
in the background that can monitor user actions, 
and potentially convert the smartphone into a 
robot that can be used in a botnet to send e-mail 
and text messages to anyone.
Apps are an emerging avenue for poten-
tial security breaches. Apple and Google now 
offer over 5 million apps collectively. Apple 
claims that it examines each and every app to 
ensure that it plays by Apple’s App Store rules, 
but risks remain. In 2014, malware known as 
WireLurker attacked iPhone and iPad users in 
China via the Mac OS X operating system, rep-
resenting the first attack on iPhones that were 
not jailbroken. Apple quickly moved to remove 
affected apps, but the attack was a warning sign 
that the iOS system is not likely to be a malware-
free environment going forward. In March 2016, 
new malware called AceDeceiver that infected 
non-jailbroken Apple devices circulated widely, 
scanning the App Store for other corrupted 
apps and automatically downloading them. That 
these corrupted apps were initially accepted by 
the App Store staff of reviewers suggests Apple 
cannot effectively review new apps prior to their 
use. This problem was further highlighted by a 
barrage of fake retail and product apps, primar-
ily from developers in China, that also appar-
ently slipped through Apple’s review process 
and began appearing in the App Store preced-
ing the 2016 holiday shopping season. Updates 
to the iOS operating system in 2016 exposed a 
series of vulnerabilities, collectively known as 
Trident, which allow attackers to take complete 
control of a phone remotely, without any indi-
cation that something has gone awry. Though 
Apple quickly scrambled to fix the vulnerability, 
releasing an operating system update in ten days, 
Trident showed that the iOS operating system 
is not as impervious to malware as many users 
believe. Any problems Apple has, it will have to 
fix by itself: third parties are not able to develop 
services to protect Apple devices as easily as 
they may be able to with Android because of 
Apple’s “walled garden” approach. Overall, more 
malware affected iOS devices in 2015 than in the 
previous five years combined.
Android’s security future appears just as 
murky. The amount of malware on the Android 
platform has skyrocketed over the past few years, 
with the number of spyware apps more than 
quadrupling from just a few years ago and dou-
bling from 2015 to 2016. According to the Pulse 
Secure Mobile Threat Center, 97% of all mobile 
malware in 2015 targeted Android devices, and 
according to Nokia, more than 9 million Android 

apps are vulnerable to remote attacks. In part this 
is due to the fact that security on the Android 
platform is much less under the control of Google 
because it employs an “open” app model com-
pared to Apple’s, which makes security flaws 
easier to detect. In 2016, security firm Check 
Point reported that malware known as Humming-
bad, which installs fraudulent apps and generates 
unwanted advertising, has infected approximately 
10 million Android devices.
Android apps can use any personal informa-
tion found on a phone but they must also inform 
the user what each app is capable of doing, and 
what personal data it requires. Google uses a uni-
versal scanning system that checks apps for mali-
cious code and removes any apps that break its 
rules against malicious activity. Google can also 
perform a remote wipe of offending apps from all 
Droid phones without user intervention. In one 
incident, Google pulled down dozens of mobile 
banking apps made by a developer called 09Droid. 
The apps claimed to give users access to their 
accounts at many banks throughout the world. 
In fact, the apps were unable to connect users to 
any bank, and were removed before they could do 
much harm. Google does take preventive steps to 
reduce malware apps such as requiring developers 
to register and be approved by Google before they 
can distribute apps through Google Play. 
Beyond the threat of rogue apps, smart-
phones of all stripes are susceptible to browser-
based malware that takes advantage of 
vulnerabilities in all browsers. In addition, 
most smartphones, including the iPhone, 
permit the manufacturers to remotely download 
configuration files to update operating systems 
and security protections. Unfortunately, flaws 
in the public key encryption procedures that 
permit remote server access to iPhones have 
been discovered, raising further questions about 
the security of such operations. Attackers have 
also developed methods of hijacking phones using 
weaknesses in SIM cards. There are at least 500 
million vulnerable SIM cards in use today, and 
the defects allow hackers to obtain the encryp-
tion key that guards users’ personal informa-
tion, granting them nearly complete access over 
the phone in the process. Many users don’t even 
take advantage of the security features they 
have available to them, such as the use of a lock 
screen, which only one-third of Android users 
have enabled.
In 2015, documents obtained by Edward 
Snowden indicated that the United States and 
Great Britain had hacked into Gemalto, a man-
ufacturer of SIM cards, and obtained encryp-
tion keys that allowed them to surveil mobile 
phone users across the globe. The investigation 
is still ongoing, but after these revelations and a 
turbulent year of security breaches on both iOS 
and Android, our smartphones and tablets don’t 
seem quite as safe anymore.

CLOUD SECURITY ISSUES
The move of so many Internet services into the cloud also raises security risks. From 
an infrastructure standpoint, DDoS attacks threaten the availability of cloud services 
on which more and more companies are relying. For instance, as previously noted, 
the DDoS attack on Dyn in 2016 caused a major disruption to cloud services across the 
United States. According to Alert Logic, which analyzed 1 billion security events in the 
IT environments of more than 3,000 enterprise customers, attacks against cloud-based 
services and applications increased by 45%. Alert Logic also found a a 36% increase in 
suspicious activity in cloud environment, such as attempts to scan the infrastructure 
(Alert Logic, 2015). Safeguarding data being maintained in a public cloud environ-
ment is also a major concern (Cloud Security Alliance, 2016). For example, research-
ers identified several ways data could be accessed without authorization on Dropbox, 
which offers a popular cloud file-sharing service. In 2014, compromising photos of as 
many as 100 celebrities such as Jennifer Lawrence were posted online, reportedly 
stolen from Apple’s iCloud. Although initially it was thought that the breach was 
made possible by a vulnerability in Apple’s Find My iPhone API, it instead apparently 
resulted from lower-tech phishing attacks that yielded passwords that could be used 
to connect to iCloud. A similar hack into writer Mat Honan’s Apple iCloud account 
using social engineering tactics in 2012 allowed the hackers to wipe everything from 
his Mac computer, iPhone, and iPad, which were linked to the cloud service, as well 
as take over his Twitter and Gmail accounts (Honan, 2012). These incidents highlight 
the risks involved as devices, identities, and data become more and more intercon-
nected in the cloud. A 2016 Ponemon Insititute study of 3,400 IT executives found 
that the majority of IT and IT security practitioners surveyed felt that the likelihood 
of a data breach increases due to the cloud, in part due to the fact that many organiza-
tions do not thoroughly examine cloud security before deploying cloud services. The 
study also found that only one-third of sensitive data in cloud-based applications was 
encrypted, and that half of the firms involved do not have a proactive approach to 
cloud security, relying instead on the cloud providers to ensure security (Loten, 2016; 
Gemalto and Ponemon, 2016).
INTERNET OF THINGS SECURITY ISSUES
As you learned in Chapter 3, the Internet of Things (IoT) involves the use of the 
Internet to connect a wide variety of sensors, devices, and machines, and is powering 
the development of a multitude of smart connected things, such as home electronics 
(smart TVs, thermostats, home security systems, and more), connected cars, medical 
devices, and industrial equipment that supports manufacturing, energy, transporta-
tion, and other industrial sectors. IoT raises a host of security issues that are in some 
ways similar to existing security issues, but even more challenging, given the need 
to deal with a wider range of devices, operating in a less controlled, global environ-
ment, and with an expanded range of attack. In a world of connected things, the 
devices, the data produced and used by the devices, and the systems and applications 
supported by those devices, can all potentially be attacked (IBM, 2015). Table 5.5 
takes a closer look at some of the unique security challenges posed by IoT identified 

by the Internet Society (ISOC), a consortium of corporations, government agencies, 
and nonprofit organizations that monitors Internet policies and practices (Internet 
Society, 2016, 2015). 
Already, alarming reports of hacked IoT devices are starting to pop up in the 
popular press. For example, in July 2015, researchers demonstrated the ability to 
hack into a Jeep Cherokee through its entertainment system, sending commands to 
the dashboard, steering, brakes, and transmission system from a remote laptop that 
turned the steering wheel, disabled the brakes, and shut down the engine (Green-
berg, 2015). Fiat Chrysler Automobiles immediately issued a recall notice to fix 
the software vulnerability involved, but it is almost certain that such incidents will 
continue to occur, as auto manufacturers add more and more wireless “connected 
car” features to automobiles. Other reports have surfaced of wireless baby monitors 
being hacked, as well as medical devices such as hospital lab blood gas analyzers, 
radiology picture archive and communication systems, drug infusion pumps, and 
hospital x-ray systems (Storm, 2015a, 2015b). The previously mentioned DDoS 2016 
attack on Dyn relied in part on millions of Internet-connected security cameras 
(Sanger and Perlroth, 2016).

Many IoT devices, such as sensors, are 
intended to be deployed on a much greater 
scale than traditional Internet-connected 
devices, creating a vast quantity of 
interconnected links that can be exploited.
Existing tools, methods, and strategies need to be 
developed to deal with this unprecedented scale.
Many instances of IoT consist of collections 
of identical devices that all have the same 
characteristics.
Magnifies the potential impact of a security 
vulnerability.
Many IoT devices are anticipated to have a 
much longer service life than typical 
equipment.
Devices may “outlive” manufacturer, leaving them 
without long-term support that creates persistent 
vulnerabilities.
Many IoT devices are intentionally designed 
without the ability to be upgraded, or the 
upgrade process is difficult.
Raises the possibility that vulnerable devices 
cannot or will not be fixed, leaving them 
perpetually vulnerable.
Many IoT devices do not provide the user 
with visibility into the workings of the device 
or the data being produced, nor alert the 
user when a security problem arises.
Users may believe an IoT device is functioning as 
intended when in fact, it may be performing in a 
malicious manner.
Some IoT devices, such as sensors, are 
unobtrusively embedded in the environment 
such that a user may not even be aware of 
the device.
Security breach might persist for a long time 
before being noticed.

TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS
At first glance, it might seem like there is not much that can be done about the 
onslaught of security breaches on the Internet. Reviewing the security threats in the 
previous section, it is clear that the threats to e-commerce are very real, widespread, 
global, potentially devastating for individuals, businesses, and entire nations, and likely 
to be increasing in intensity along with the growth in e-commerce and the continued 
expansion of the Internet. But in fact a great deal of progress has been made by private 
security firms, corporate and home users, network administrators, technology firms, 
and government agencies. There are two lines of defense: technology solutions and 
policy solutions. In this section, we consider some technology solutions, and in the 
following section, we look at some policy solutions that work.
The first line of defense against the wide variety of security threats to an e-com-
merce site is a set of tools that can make it difficult for outsiders to invade or destroy 
a site. Figure 5.5 illustrates the major tools available to achieve site security.
PROTECTING INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS
Because e-commerce transactions must flow over the public Internet, and therefore 
involve thousands of routers and servers through which the transaction packets flow, 
security experts believe the greatest security threats occur at the level of Internet com-
munications. This is very different from a private network where a dedicated communi-
cation line is established between two parties. A number of tools are available to protect 
the security of Internet communications, the most basic of which is message encryption.

ENCRYPTION
Encryption is the process of transforming plain text or data into cipher text that 
cannot be read by anyone other than the sender and the receiver. The purpose of 
encryption is (a) to secure stored information and (b) to secure information transmis-
sion. Encryption can provide four of the six key dimensions of e-commerce security 
referred to in Table 5.3 on page 260:
•	 Message integrity—provides assurance that the message has not been altered.
•	 Nonrepudiation—prevents the user from denying he or she sent the message.
•	 Authentication—provides verification of the identity of the person (or computer) 
sending the message.
•	 Confidentiality—gives assurance that the message was not read by others.
This transformation of plain text to cipher text is accomplished by using a key or 
cipher. A key (or cipher) is any method for transforming plain text to cipher text.
Encryption has been practiced since the earliest forms of writing and commercial 
transactions. Ancient Egyptian and Phoenician commercial records were encrypted 
using substitution and transposition ciphers. In a substitution cipher, every occur-
rence of a given letter is replaced systematically by another letter. For instance, if we 
used the cipher “letter plus two”—meaning replace every letter in a word with a new 
letter two places forward—then the word “Hello” in plain text would be transformed 
into the following cipher text: “JGNNQ.” In a transposition cipher, the ordering of 
the letters in each word is changed in some systematic way. Leonardo Da Vinci 
recorded his shop notes in reverse order, making them readable only with a mirror. 
The word “Hello” can be written backwards as “OLLEH.” A more complicated cipher 
would (a) break all words into two words and (b) spell the first word with every other 
letter beginning with the first letter, and then spell the second word with all the 
remaining letters. In this cipher, “HELLO” would be written as “HLO EL.”
Symmetric Key Cryptography
In order to decipher (decrypt) these messages, the receiver would have to know the 
secret cipher that was used to encrypt the plain text. This is called symmetric key 
cryptography or secret key cryptography. In symmetric key cryptography, both the 
sender and the receiver use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the message. How do 
the sender and the receiver have the same key? They have to send it over some com-
munication media or exchange the key in person. Symmetric key cryptography was 
used extensively throughout World War II and is still a part of Internet cryptography.
The possibilities for simple substitution and transposition ciphers are endless, but 
they all suffer from common flaws. First, in the digital age, computers are so power-
ful and fast that these ancient means of encryption can be broken quickly. Second, 
symmetric key cryptography requires that both parties share the same key. In order 
to share the same key, they must send the key over a presumably insecure medium 
where it could be stolen and used to decipher messages. If the secret key is lost or 
stolen, the entire encryption system fails. Third, in commercial use, where we are not 
all part of the same team, you would need a secret key for each of the parties with 
whom you transacted, that is, one key for the bank, another for the department store,

and another for the government. In a large population of users, this could result in as 
many as n(n–1) keys. In a population of millions of Internet users, thousands of millions 
of keys would be needed to accommodate all e-commerce customers (estimated at 
about 177 million in the United States). Potentially, 177² million different keys would 
be needed. Clearly this situation would be too unwieldy to work in practice.
Modern encryption systems are digital. The ciphers or keys used to transform 
plain text into cipher text are digital strings. Computers store text or other data as 
binary strings composed of 0s and 1s. For instance, the binary representation of the 
capital letter “A” in ASCII computer code is accomplished with eight binary digits (bits): 
01000001. One way in which digital strings can be transformed into cipher text is by 
multiplying each letter by another binary number, say, an eight-bit key number 0101 
0101. If we multiplied every digital character in our text messages by this eight-bit key 
and sent the encrypted message to a friend along with the secret eight-bit key, the 
friend could decode the message easily.
The strength of modern security protection is measured in terms of the length of 
the binary key used to encrypt the data. In the preceding example, the eight-bit key is 
easily deciphered because there are only 28 or 256 possibilities. If the intruder knows 
you are using an eight-bit key, then he or she could decode the message in a few 
seconds using a modern desktop PC just by using the brute force method of checking 
each of the 256 possible keys. For this reason, modern digital encryption systems use 
keys with 56, 128, 256, or 512 binary digits. With encryption keys of 512 digits, there 
are 2512 possibilities to check out. It is estimated that all the computers in the world 
would need to work for 10 years before stumbling upon the answer.
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) was developed by the National Security 
Agency (NSA) and IBM in the 1950s. DES uses a 56-bit encryption key. To cope with 
much faster computers, it has been improved by the Triple DES Encryption Algorithm 
(TDEA)—essentially encrypting the message three times, each with a separate key. 
Today, the most widely used symmetric key algorithm is Advanced Encryption 
Standard (AES), which offers key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits. AES had been con-
sidered to be relatively secure, but in 2011, researchers from Microsoft and a Belgian 
university announced that they had discovered a way to break the algorithm, and with 
this work, the “safety margin” of AES continues to erode. There are also many other 
symmetric key systems that are currently less widely used, with keys up to 2,048 bits.1 
Public Key Cryptography
In 1976, a new way of encrypting messages called public key cryptography was 
invented by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. Public key cryptography (also referred 
to as asymmetric cryptography) solves the problem of exchanging keys. In this method, 
two mathematically related digital keys are used: a public key and a private key. The 
private key is kept secret by the owner, and the public key is widely disseminated. Both 
keys can be used to encrypt and decrypt a message. However, once the keys are used

described later in this chapter, which uses 128-bit keys.

FIGURE 5.6	
PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY—A SIMPLE CASE
In the simplest use of public key cryptography, the sender encrypts a message using the recipient’s public 
key, and then sends it over the Internet. The only person who can decrypt this message is the recipient, 
using his or her private key. However, this simple case does not ensure integrity or an authentic message.
S T E P
D E S C R I P T I O N
1.  The sender creates a digital 
message.
The message could be a document, spreadsheet, or any 
digital object.
2.  The sender obtains the recipient’s 
public key from a public directory 
and applies it to the message.
Public keys are distributed widely and can be obtained 
from recipients directly.
3.  Application of the recipient’s key 
produces an encrypted cipher text 
message.
Once encrypted using the public key, the message cannot 
be reverse-engineered or unencrypted using the same 
public key. The process is irreversible.
4.  The encrypted message is sent over 
the Internet.
The encrypted message is broken into packets and sent 
through several different pathways, making interception 
of the entire message difficult (but not impossible).
5.  The recipient uses his/her private 
key to decrypt the message.
The only person who can decrypt the message is the 
person who has possession of the recipient’s private key. 
Hopefully, this is the legitimate recipient.
to encrypt a message, the same key cannot be used to unencrypt the message. The 
mathematical algorithms used to produce the keys are one-way functions. A one-way 
irreversible mathematical function is one in which, once the algorithm is applied, the input 
cannot be subsequently derived from the output. Most food recipes are like this. For 
instance, it is easy to make scrambled eggs, but impossible to retrieve whole eggs from 
the scrambled eggs. Public key cryptography is based on the idea of irreversible math-
ematical functions. The keys are sufficiently long (128, 256, and 512 bits) that it would 
take enormous computing power to derive one key from the other using the largest and 
fastest computers available. Figure 5.6 illustrates a simple use of public key cryptogra-
phy and takes you through the important steps in using public and private keys.

Public Key Cryptography Using Digital Signatures and Hash Digests
In public key cryptography, some elements of security are missing. Although we 
can be quite sure the message was not understood or read by a third party (message 
confidentiality), there is no guarantee the sender really is the sender; that is, there 
is no authentication of the sender. This means the sender could deny ever sending 
the message (repudiation). And there is no assurance the message was not altered 
somehow in transit. For example, the message “Buy Cisco @ $16” could have been 
accidentally or intentionally altered to read “Sell Cisco @ $16.” This suggests a poten-
tial lack of integrity in the system.
A more sophisticated use of public key cryptography can achieve authentication, 
nonrepudiation, and integrity. Figure 5.7 illustrates this more powerful approach.
To check the integrity of a message and ensure it has not been altered in transit, 
a hash function is used first to create a digest of the message. A hash function is an 
algorithm that produces a fixed-length number called a hash or message digest. A hash 
function can be simple, and count the number of digital 1s in a message, or it can be 
more complex, and produce a 128-bit number that reflects the number of 0s and 1s, 
the number of 00s and 11s, and so on. Standard hash functions are available (MD4 and 
MD5 produce 128- and 160-bit hashes) (Stein, 1998). These more complex hash func-
tions produce hashes or hash results that are unique to every message. The results of 
applying the hash function are sent by the sender to the recipient. Upon receipt, the 
recipient applies the hash function to the received message and checks to verify the 
same result is produced. If so, the message has not been altered. The sender then 
encrypts both the hash result and the original message using the recipient’s public 
key (as in Figure 5.6 on page 289), producing a single block of cipher text.
One more step is required. To ensure the authenticity of the message and to 
ensure nonrepudiation, the sender encrypts the entire block of cipher text one more 
time using the sender’s private key. This produces a digital signature (also called an 
e-signature) or “signed” cipher text that can be sent over the Internet.
A digital signature is a close parallel to a handwritten signature. Like a handwrit-
ten signature, a digital signature is unique—only one person presumably possesses 
the private key. When used with a hash function, the digital signature is even more 
unique than a handwritten signature. In addition to being exclusive to a particular 
individual, when used to sign a hashed document, the digital signature is also unique 
to the document, and changes for every document.
The recipient of this signed cipher text first uses the sender’s public key to authen-
ticate the message. Once authenticated, the recipient uses his or her private key to 
obtain the hash result and original message. As a final step, the recipient applies the 
same hash function to the original text, and compares the result with the result sent 
by the sender. If the results are the same, the recipient now knows the message has 
not been changed during transmission. The message has integrity.
Early digital signature programs required the user to have a digital certificate, and 
were far too difficult for an individual to use. Newer programs are Internet-based and 
do not require users to install software, or understand digital certificate technology.

conform to one another.
The hash function is used here to check the original message. 
This ensures the message was not changed in transit.
A more realistic use of public key cryptography uses hash functions and digital signatures to both ensure the confidentiality of the message 
and authenticate the sender. The only person who could have sent the above message is the owner or the sender using his/her private key. 
This authenticates the message. The hash function ensures the message was not altered in transit. As before, the only person who can 
decipher the message is the recipient, using his/her private key.

digital signature solutions. Many insurance, finance, and surety companies now permit 
customers to electronically sign documents.
Digital Envelopes
Public key cryptography is computationally slow. If one used 128- or 256-bit keys to 
encode large documents—such as this chapter or the entire book—significant declines 
in transmission speeds and increases in processing time would occur. Symmetric key 
cryptography is computationally faster, but as we pointed out previously, it has a weak-
ness—namely, the symmetric key must be sent to the recipient over insecure transmis-
sion lines. One solution is to use the more efficient symmetric encryption and 
decryption for large documents, but public key cryptography to encrypt and send the 
symmetric key. This technique is called using a digital envelope. See Figure 5.8 for 
an illustration of how a digital envelope works.
In Figure 5.8, a diplomatic document is encrypted using a symmetric key. The 
symmetric key—which the recipient will require to decrypt the document—is itself 
encrypted, using the recipient’s public key. So we have a “key within a key” (a digital 
envelope). The encrypted report and the digital envelope are sent across the Web. 
The recipient first uses his/her private key to decrypt the symmetric key, and then 
digital envelope
a technique that uses 
symmetric encryption for 
large documents, but 
public key cryptography to 
encrypt and send the 
symmetric key

the recipient uses the symmetric key to decrypt the report. This method saves time 
because both encryption and decryption are faster with symmetric keys.
Digital Certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
There are still some deficiencies in the message security regime described previously. 
How do we know that people and institutions are who they claim to be? Anyone can 
make up a private and public key combination and claim to be someone they are not. 
Before you place an order with an online merchant such as Amazon, you want to be 
sure it really is Amazon you have on the screen and not a spoofer masquerading as 
Amazon. In the physical world, if someone asks who you are and you show a social 
security number, they may well ask to see a picture ID or a second form of certifiable 
or acceptable identification. If they really doubt who you are, they may ask for refer-
ences to other authorities and actually interview these other authorities. Similarly, 
in the digital world, we need a way to know who people and institutions really are.
Digital certificates, and the supporting public key infrastructure, are an attempt 
to solve this problem of digital identity. A digital certificate is a digital document 
issued by a trusted third-party institution known as a certification authority (CA) 
that contains the name of the subject or company, the subject’s public key, a digital 
certificate serial number, an expiration date, an issuance date, the digital signature of 
the certification authority (the name of the CA encrypted using the CA’s private key), 
and other identifying information (see Figure 5.9).

In the United States, private corporations such as VeriSign, browser manufactur-
ers, security firms, and government agencies such as the U.S. Postal Service and the 
Federal Reserve issue CAs. Worldwide, thousands of organizations issue CAs. A hier-
archy of CAs has emerged with less-well-known CAs being certified by larger and 
better-known CAs, creating a community of mutually verifying institutions. Public 
key infrastructure (PKI) refers to the CAs and digital certificate procedures that are 
accepted by all parties. When you sign into a “secure” site, the URL will begin with 
“https” and a closed lock icon will appear on your browser. This means the site has a 
digital certificate issued by a trusted CA. It is not, presumably, a spoof site.
To create a digital certificate, the user generates a public/private key pair and 
sends a request for certification to a CA along with the user’s public key. The CA veri-
fies the information (how this is accomplished differs from CA to CA). The CA issues 
a certificate containing the user’s public key and other related information. Finally, 
the CA creates a message digest from the certificate itself (just like a hash digest) and 
signs it with the CA’s private key. This signed digest is called the signed certificate. We 
end up with a totally unique cipher text document—there can be only one signed 
certificate like this in the world.
There are several ways the certificates are used in commerce. Before initiating a 
transaction, the customer can request the signed digital certificate of the merchant and 
decrypt it using the merchant’s public key to obtain both the message digest and the 
certificate as issued. If the message digest matches the certificate, then the merchant 
and the public key are authenticated. The merchant may in return request certifica-
tion of the user, in which case the user would send the merchant his or her individual 
certificate. There are many types of certificates: personal, institutional, web server, 
software publisher, and CAs themselves.
PKI and CAs can also be used to secure software code and content for applications 
that are directly downloaded to mobile devices from the Internet. Using a technique 
referred to as code signing, mobile application developers use their private key to 
encrypt a digital signature. When end users decrypt the signature with the correspond-
ing public key, it confirms the developer’s identity and the integrity of the code. 
You can easily obtain a public and private key for personal, noncommercial use 
at the International PGP Home Page website, Pgpi.org. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) 
was invented in 1991 by Phil Zimmerman, and has become one of the most widely 
used e-mail public key encryption software tools in the world. Using PGP software 
installed on your computer, you can compress and encrypt your messages as well as 
authenticate both yourself and the recipient. There are also a number of Firefox, 
Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Safari add-ons, extensions, or plug-ins that enable you 
to encrypt your e-mail. 
Limitations of PKI
PKI is a powerful technological solution to security issues, but it has many limitations, 
especially concerning CAs. PKI applies mainly to protecting messages in transit on 
the Internet and is not effective against insiders—employees—who have legitimate 
access to corporate systems including customer information. Most e-commerce sites

do not store customer information in encrypted form. Other limitations are apparent. 
For one, how is your private key to be protected? Most private keys will be stored on 
insecure desktop or laptop computers.
There is no guarantee the person using your computer—and your private key—is 
really you. For instance, you may lose your laptop or smartphone, and therefore lose 
the private key. Likewise, there is no assurance that someone else in the world cannot 
use your personal ID papers, such as a social security card, to obtain a PKI authen-
ticated online ID in your name. If there’s no real world identification system, there 
can be no truly secure Internet identification system. Under many digital signature 
laws, you are responsible for whatever your private key does even if you were not the 
person using the key. This is very different from mail-order or telephone order credit 
card rules, where you have a right to dispute the credit card charge. Second, there is 
no guarantee the verifying computer of the merchant is secure. Third, CAs are self-
selected organizations seeking to gain access to the business of authorization. They 
may not be authorities on the corporations or individuals they certify. For instance, 
how can a CA know about all the corporations within an industry to determine who 
is or is not legitimate? A related question concerns the method used by the CA to 
identify the certificate holder. Was this an e-mail transaction verified only by claims of 
the applicants who filled out an online form? For instance, VeriSign acknowledged in 
one case that it had mistakenly issued two digital certificates to someone fraudulently 
claiming to represent Microsoft. Digital certificates have been hijacked by hackers, 
tricking consumers into giving up personal information. For example, in 2014, India’s 
National Informatics Centre, an intermediate CA that was trusted by the Indian Con-
troller of Certifying Authorities, whose certificates were included in the Microsoft 
Root Store and thus trusted by the vast majority of programs running on Windows, 
including Internet Explorer and Chrome, was hacked and a number of unauthorized 
digital certificates were issued for domains operated by Google and Yahoo (Datta, 
2014). Last, what are the policies for revoking or renewing certificates? The expected 
life of a digital certificate or private key is a function of the frequency of use and the 
vulnerability of systems that use the certificate. Yet most CAs have no policy or just 
an annual policy for reissuing certificates. If Microsoft, Apple, or Cisco ever rescinded 
a number of CAs, millions of users would not be able to access sites. The CA system 
is difficult and costly to police.
SECURING CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION
The concepts of public key cryptography are used routinely for securing channels of 
communication.
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS)
The most common form of securing channels is through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. When you receive a message from a server 
on the Web with which you will be communicating through a secure channel, this 
means you will be using SSL/TLS to establish a secure negotiated session. (Notice that 
the URL changes from HTTP to HTTPS.) A secure negotiated session is a client-
secure negotiated 
session
a client-server session in 
which the URL of the 
requested document, along 
with the contents, contents 
of forms, and the cookies 
exchanged, are encrypted

296	
	
C H A P T E R  5     E - c o m m e r c e  S e c u r i t y  a n d  P a y m e n t  S y s t e m s 
server session in which the URL of the requested document, along with the contents, 
contents of forms, and the cookies exchanged, are encrypted (see Figure 5.10). For 
instance, your credit card number that you entered into a form would be encrypted. 
Through a series of handshakes and communications, the browser and the server 
establish one another’s identity by exchanging digital certificates, decide on the stron-
gest shared form of encryption, and then proceed to communicate using an agreed-
upon session key. A session key is a unique symmetric encryption key chosen just 
for this single secure session. Once used, it is gone forever. Figure 5.10 shows how this 
works.
In practice, most private individuals do not have a digital certificate. In this case, 
the merchant server will not request a certificate, but the client browser will request 
the merchant certificate once a secure session is called for by the server.
SSL/TLS provides data encryption, server authentication, optional client authen-
tication, and message integrity for TCP/IP connections. SSL/TLS addresses the issue 
of authenticity by allowing users to verify another user’s identity or the identity of a 
server. It also protects the integrity of the messages exchanged. However, once the 
merchant receives the encrypted credit and order information, that information is typi-
session key
a unique symmetric encryp-
tion key chosen for a single 
secure session
	 FIGURE 5.10

cally stored in unencrypted format on the merchant’s servers. While SSL/TLS provides 
secure transactions between merchant and consumer, it only guarantees server-side 
authentication. Client authentication is optional.
In addition, SSL/TLS cannot provide irrefutability—consumers can order goods 
or download information products, and then claim the transaction never occurred. 
Recently, social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter have begun to use SSL/
TLS for a variety of reasons, including the ability to thwart account hijacking using 
Firesheep over wireless networks. Firesheep, an add-on for Firefox, can be used by 
hackers to grab unencrypted cookies used to “remember” a user and allow the hacker 
to immediately log on to a website as that user. SSL/TLS can thwart such an attack 
because it encrypts the cookie. In June 2015, the White House’s Office of Manage-
ment and Budget issued a memorandum requiring that all publicly accessible federal 
websites and web services use HTTPS by December 31, 2016. HTTPS encrypts user 
requests to website servers. It is implemented by the server adopting the HTTP Strict 
Transport Security (HSTS) feature that forces browsers to only access the server using 
HTTPS (CIO.gov, 2016).
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
A virtual private network (VPN) allows remote users to securely access a corpora-
tion’s local area network via the Internet, using a variety of VPN protocols. VPNs use 
both authentication and encryption to secure information from unauthorized persons 
(providing confidentiality and integrity). Authentication prevents spoofing and mis-
representation of identities. A remote user can connect to a remote private local 
network using a local ISP. The VPN protocols will establish the link from the client to 
the corporate network as if the user had dialed into the corporate network directly. 
The process of connecting one protocol through another (IP) is called tunneling, 
because the VPN creates a private connection by adding an invisible wrapper around 
a message to hide its content. As the message travels through the Internet between 
the ISP and the corporate network, it is shielded from prying eyes by an encrypted 
wrapper.
A VPN is “virtual” in the sense that it appears to users as a dedicated secure line 
when in fact it is a temporary secure line. The primary use of VPNs is to establish 
secure communications among business partners—larger suppliers or customers, and 
employees working remotely. A dedicated connection to a business partner can be 
very expensive. Using the Internet and VPN as the connection method significantly 
reduces the cost of secure communications.
Wireless (Wi-Fi) Networks 
Accessing the Internet via a wireless (Wi-Fi) network has its own particular security 
issues. Early Wi-Fi networks used a security standard called Wired Equivalent Privacy 
(WEP) to encrypt information. WEP was very weak, and easy for hackers to crack. A 
new standard, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), was developed that provided a higher 
standard of protection, but this too soon became vulnerable to intrusion. Today, the 
current standard is WPA2, which uses the AES algorithm for encryption and CCMP, 
a more advanced authentication code protocol.

PROTECTING NETWORKS
Once you have protected communications as well as possible, the next set of tools to 
consider are those that can protect your networks, as well as the servers and clients 
on those networks.
Firewalls
Firewalls and proxy servers are intended to build a wall around your network and the 
attached servers and clients, just like physical-world firewalls protect you from fires 
for a limited period of time. Firewalls and proxy servers share some similar functions, 
but they are quite different.
A firewall refers to either hardware or software that filters communication packets 
and prevents some packets from entering or exiting the network based on a security 
policy. The firewall controls traffic to and from servers and clients, forbidding com-
munications from untrustworthy sources, and allowing other communications from 
trusted sources to proceed. Every message that is to be sent or received from the 
network is processed by the firewall, which determines if the message meets security 
guidelines established by the business. If it does, it is permitted to be distributed, and 
if it doesn’t, the message is blocked. Firewalls can filter traffic based on packet attri-
butes such as source IP address, destination port or IP address, type of service (such 
as WWW or HTTP), the domain name of the source, and many other dimensions. Most 
hardware firewalls that protect local area networks connected to the Internet have 
default settings that require little if any administrator intervention and employ simple 
but effective rules that deny incoming packets from a connection that does not origi-
nate from an internal request—the firewall only allows connections from servers that 
you requested service from. A common default setting on hardware firewalls (DSL 
and cable modem routers) simply ignores efforts to communicate with TCP port 445, 
the most commonly attacked port. The increasing use of firewalls by home and busi-
ness Internet users has greatly reduced the effectiveness of attacks, and forced hackers 
to focus more on e-mail attachments to distribute worms and viruses.
There are two major methods firewalls use to validate traffic: packet filters and 
application gateways. Packet filters examine data packets to determine whether they are 
destined for a prohibited port or originate from a prohibited IP address (as specified 
by the security administrator). The filter specifically looks at the source and destina-
tion information, as well as the port and packet type, when determining whether the 
information may be transmitted. One downside of the packet filtering method is that 
it is susceptible to spoofing, because authentication is not one of its roles.
Application gateways are a type of firewall that filters communications based on 
the application being requested, rather than the source or destination of the message. 
Such firewalls also process requests at the application level, farther away from the client 
computer than packet filters. By providing a central filtering point, application gateways 
provide greater security than packet filters but can compromise system performance.
Next-generation firewalls use an application-centric approach to firewall control. 
They are able to identify applications regardless of the port, protocol, or security 
evasion tools used; identify users regardless of device or IP address; decrypt outbound 
SSL; and protect in real-time against threats embedded in applications.

Proxy Servers
Proxy servers (proxies) are software servers (often a dedicated computer) that handle 
all communications originating from or being sent to the Internet by local clients, acting 
as a spokesperson or bodyguard for the organization. Proxies act primarily to limit access 
of internal clients to external Internet servers, although some proxy servers act as fire-
walls as well. Proxy servers are sometimes called dual-home systems because they have 
two network interfaces. To internal computers, a proxy server is known as the gateway, 
while to external computers it is known as a mail server or numeric address.
When a user on an internal network requests a web page, the request is routed 
first to the proxy server. The proxy server validates the user and the nature of the 
request, and then sends the request onto the Internet. A web page sent by an exter-
nal Internet server first passes to the proxy server. If acceptable, the web page passes 
onto the internal network web server and then to the client desktop. By prohibiting 
users from communicating directly with the Internet, companies can restrict access 
to certain types of sites, such as pornographic, auction, or stock-trading sites. Proxy 
servers also improve web performance by storing frequently requested web pages 
locally, reducing upload times, and hiding the internal network’s address, thus making 
it more difficult for hackers to monitor. Figure 5.11 illustrates how firewalls and proxy 
servers protect a local area network from Internet intruders and prevent internal 
clients from reaching prohibited web servers.

The primary function of a firewall is to deny access by remote client computers to local computers. The 
primary purpose of a proxy server is to provide controlled access from local computers to remote computers.

Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
In addition to a firewall and proxy server, an intrusion detection and/or prevention 
system can be installed. An intrusion detection system (IDS) examines network 
traffic, watching to see if it matches certain patterns or preconfigured rules indicative of 
an attack. If it detects suspicious activity, the IDS will set off an alarm alerting adminis-
trators and log the event in a database. An IDS is useful for detecting malicious activity 
that a firewall might miss. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) has all the function-
ality of an IDS, with the additional ability to take steps to prevent and block suspicious 
activities. For instance, an IPS can terminate a session and reset a connection, block 
traffic from a suspicious IP address, or reconfigure firewall or router security controls.
PROTECTING SERVERS AND CLIENTS
Operating system features and anti-virus software can help further protect servers and 
clients from certain types of attacks.
Operating System Security Enhancements
The most obvious way to protect servers and clients is to take advantage of automatic 
computer security upgrades. The Microsoft, Apple, and Linux/Unix operating systems 
are continuously updated to patch vulnerabilities discovered by hackers. These patches 
are autonomic; that is, when using these operating systems on the Internet, you are 
prompted and informed that operating system enhancements are available. Users can 
easily download these security patches for free. The most common known worms and 
viruses can be prevented by simply keeping your server and client operating systems and 
applications up to date. In April 2014, Microsoft ended security support and updates for 
its Windows XP operating system. Despite this, many organizations continue to use XP-
based systems, and as a result, many security experts anticipate a wave of strikes against 
such systems. Application vulnerabilities are fixed in the same manner. For instance, 
most popular Internet browsers are updated automatically with little user intervention.
Anti-Virus Software
The easiest and least-expensive way to prevent threats to system integrity is to install 
anti-virus software. Programs by Malwarebytes, McAfee, Symantec (Norton AntiVi-
rus), and many others provide inexpensive tools to identify and eradicate the most 
common types of malicious code as they enter a computer, as well as destroy those 
already lurking on a hard drive. Anti-virus programs can be set up so that e-mail attach-
ments are inspected before you click on them, and the attachments are eliminated 
if they contain a known virus or worm. It is not enough, however, to simply install 
the software once. Because new viruses are developed and released every day, daily 
routine updates are needed in order to prevent new threats from being loaded. Some 
premium-level anti-virus software is updated hourly.
Anti-virus suite packages and stand-alone programs are available to eliminate 
intruders such as bot programs, adware, and other security risks. Such programs work 
much like anti-virus software in that they look for recognized hacker tools or signature 
actions of known intruders.

MANAGEMENT POLICIES, BUSINESS PROCEDURES, 
AND PUBLIC LAWS
Worldwide, in 2016, companies are expected to spend over $81 billion on security hard-
ware, software, and services, up 8% from the previous year (Gartner, 2016). However, 
most CEOs and CIOs believe that technology is not the sole answer to managing the 
risk of e-commerce. The technology provides a foundation, but in the absence of intel-
ligent management policies, even the best technology can be easily defeated. Public 
laws and active enforcement of cybercrime statutes also are required to both raise the 
costs of illegal behavior on the Internet and guard against corporate abuse of informa-
tion. Let’s consider briefly the development of management policy.
A SECURITY PLAN: MANAGEMENT POLICIES
In order to minimize security threats, e-commerce firms must develop a coherent 
corporate policy that takes into account the nature of the risks, the information assets 
that need protecting, and the procedures and technologies required to address the risk, 
as well as implementation and auditing mechanisms. Figure 5.12 illustrates the key 
steps in developing a solid security plan.

DEVELOPING AN E-COMMERCE SECURITY PLAN
There are five steps involved in building an e-commerce security plan.

A security plan begins with risk assessment—an assessment of the risks and 
points of vulnerability. The first step is to inventory the information and knowledge 
assets of the e-commerce site and company. What information is at risk? Is it customer 
information, proprietary designs, business activities, secret processes, or other inter-
nal information, such as price schedules, executive compensation, or payroll? For each 
type of information asset, try to estimate the dollar value to the firm if this informa-
tion were compromised, and then multiply that amount by the probability of the loss 
occurring. Once you have done so, rank order the results. You now have a list of infor-
mation assets prioritized by their value to the firm.
Based on your quantified list of risks, you can start to develop a security policy—
a set of statements prioritizing the information risks, identifying acceptable risk 
targets, and identifying the mechanisms for achieving these targets. You will obviously 
want to start with the information assets that you determined to be the highest prior-
ity in your risk assessment. Who generates and controls this information in the firm? 
What existing security policies are in place to protect the information? What enhance-
ments can you recommend to improve security of these most valuable assets? What 
level of risk are you willing to accept for each of these assets? Are you willing, for 
instance, to lose customer credit card data once every 10 years? Or will you pursue a 
100-year hurricane strategy by building a security edifice for credit card data that can 
withstand the once-in-100-year disaster? You will need to estimate how much it will 
cost to achieve this level of acceptable risk. Remember, total and complete security 
may require extraordinary financial resources. By answering these questions, you will 
have the beginnings of a security policy.
Next, consider an implementation plan—the steps you will take to achieve the 
security plan goals. Specifically, you must determine how you will translate the levels 
of acceptable risk into a set of tools, technologies, policies, and procedures. What new 
technologies will you deploy to achieve the goals, and what new employee procedures 
will be needed?
To implement your plan, you will need an organizational unit in charge of secu-
rity, and a security officer—someone who is in charge of security on a daily basis. For 
a small e-commerce site, the security officer will likely be the person in charge of 
Internet services or the site manager, whereas for larger firms, there typically is a 
dedicated team with a supporting budget. The security organization educates and 
trains users, keeps management aware of security threats and breakdowns, and main-
tains the tools chosen to implement security.
The security organization typically administers access controls, authentication 
procedures, and authorization policies. Access controls determine which outsiders 
and insiders can gain legitimate access to your networks. Outsider access controls 
include firewalls and proxy servers, while insider access controls typically consist of 
login procedures (usernames, passwords, and access codes).
Authentication procedures include the use of digital signatures, certificates of 
authority, and PKI. Now that e-signatures have been given the same legal weight as 
an original pen-and-ink version, companies are in the process of devising ways to test 
and confirm a signer’s identity. Companies frequently have signers type their full

name and click on a button indicating their understanding that they have just signed 
a contract or document.
Biometric devices can also be used to verify physical attributes associated with 
an individual, such as a fingerprint or retina (eye) scan or speech recognition system. 
(Biometrics is the study of measurable biological, or physical, characteristics.) A 
company could require, for example, that an individual undergo a fingerprint scan 
before being allowed access to a website, or before being allowed to pay for merchan-
dise with a credit card. Biometric devices make it even more difficult for hackers to 
break into sites or facilities, significantly reducing the opportunity for spoofing. Newer 
Apple iPhones (5S and later) feature a fingerprint sensor called Touch ID built into 
the iPhone’s home button that can unlock the phone and authorize purchases from 
the iTunes, iBooks, and App Stores without requiring users to enter a PIN or other 
security code. According to Apple, the system does not store an actual fingerprint, but 
rather biometric data, which will be encrypted and stored only on a chip within the 
iPhone, and will not be made available to third parties.
Security tokens are physical devices or software that generate an identifier that 
can be used in addition to or in place of a password. Security tokens are used by mil-
lions of corporation and government workers to log on to corporate clients and servers. 
One example is RSA’s SecurID token, which continously generates six-digit passwords.
Authorization policies determine differing levels of access to information assets 
for differing levels of users. Authorization management systems establish where 
and when a user is permitted to access certain parts of a website. Their primary func-
tion is to restrict access to private information within a company’s Internet infrastruc-
ture. Although there are several authorization management products currently 
available, most operate in the same way: the system encrypts a user session to function 
like a passkey that follows the user from page to page, allowing access only to those 
areas that the user is permitted to enter, based on information set at the system data-
base. By establishing entry rules up front for each user, the authorization management 
system knows who is permitted to go where at all times.
The last step in developing an e-commerce security plan is performing a security 
audit. A security audit involves the routine review of access logs (identifying how 
outsiders are using the site as well as how insiders are accessing the site’s assets). A 
monthly report should be produced that establishes the routine and nonroutine 
accesses to the systems and identifies unusual patterns of activities. As previously 
noted, tiger teams are often used by large corporate sites to evaluate the strength of 
existing security procedures. Many small firms have sprung up in the last five years 
to provide these services to large corporate sites.
THE ROLE OF LAWS AND PUBLIC POLICY
The public policy environment today is very different from the early days of e-com-
merce. The net result is that the Internet is no longer an ungoverned, unsupervised, 
self-controlled technology juggernaut. Just as with financial markets in the last 70 
years, there is a growing awareness that e-commerce markets work only when a pow-
erful institutional set of laws and enforcement mechanisms are in place. These laws

help ensure orderly, rational, and fair markets. This growing public policy environ-
ment is becoming just as global as e-commerce itself. Despite some spectacular inter-
nationally based attacks on U.S. e-commerce sites, the sources and persons involved 
in major harmful attacks have almost always been uncovered and, where possible, 
prosecuted.
Voluntary and private efforts have played a very large role in identifying crimi-
nal hackers and assisting law enforcement. Since 1995, as e-commerce has grown in 
significance, national and local law enforcement activities have expanded greatly. 
New laws have been passed that grant local and national authorities new tools and 
mechanisms for identifying, tracing, and prosecuting cybercriminals. For instance, 
a majority of states now require companies that maintain personal data on their 
residents to publicly disclose when a security breach affecting those residents has 
occurred. Table 5.6 lists the most significant federal e-commerce security legisla-
tion and regulation. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has asserted that it 
has authority over corporations’ data security practices. The FTC sued the Wyndham 
hotel chain after hacking attacks in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a data breach that 
led to fraudulent credit charges of more than $10 million. According to the FTC, its 
investigation showed that Wyndham had failed to follow basic data security prac-
tices, while at the same time assuring customers that their data was safe. In August 
2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that the FTC was within 
the scope of its authority, opening the door for it to take a greater role, especially 
in light of the failure of Congress to adopt legislation governing data security. By 
increasing the punishment for cybercrimes, the U.S. government is attempting to 
create a deterrent to further hacker actions. And by making such actions federal 
crimes, the government is able to extradite international hackers and prosecute them 
within the United States.
After September 11, 2001, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act, which broadly 
expanded law enforcement’s investigative and surveillance powers. The act has pro-
visions for monitoring e-mail and Internet use. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 
also attempts to fight cyberterrorism and increases the government’s ability to compel 
information disclosure by computer and ISP sources. Recent proposed legislation 
that focuses on requiring firms to report data breaches to the FTC, protection of the 
national electric grid, and cybersecurity has all failed to pass. However, in December 
2015, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) was signed into law by Presi-
dent Obama. The Act, which creates a system that lets companies share evidence 
about attacks without the risk of being sued, had been opposed by many large tech-
nology companies and privacy advocates on the grounds that it did not do enough 
to protect individual privacy and could lead to increased government surveillance. 
However, implementation of the CISA is still a work in progress and it remains to be 
seen how effective it will be (Chew and Newby, 2016; Peterson, 2015).
Private and Private-Public Cooperation Efforts
The good news is that e-commerce sites are not alone in their battle to achieve secu-
rity on the Internet. Several organizations—some public and some private—are

devoted to tracking down criminal organizations and individuals engaged in attacks 
against Internet and e-commerce sites. On the federal level, the Office of Cyberse-
curity and Communications (CS&C) within the U.S. Department of Homeland Secu-
rity (DHS) is responsible for overseeing the security, resilience, and reliability of 
the United States’ cyber and communications infrastructure. The National Cyberse-
curity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) acts as a 24/7 cyber moni-
toring, incident response, and management center. In addition, the DHS also 
operates the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), 
which coordinates cyber incident warnings and responses across both the govern-
ment and private sectors. One of the better-known private organizations is the CERT 
Coordination Center (formerly known as the Computer Emergency Response 
Team) at Carnegie Mellon University. CERT monitors and tracks online criminal 
activity reported to it by private corporations and government agencies that seek 
out its help. CERT is composed of full-time and part-time computer experts who can 
trace the origins of attacks against sites despite the complexity of the Internet. Its 
staff members also assist organizations in identifying security problems, developing 
solutions, and communicating with the public about widespread hacker threats. The 
CERT Coordination Center also provides product assessments, reports, and training 
in order to improve the public’s knowledge and understanding of security threats 
and solutions. 
Government Policies and Controls on Encryption
In the United States, both Congress and the executive branch have sought to regulate 
the uses of encryption and to restrict availability and export of encryption systems as 
a means of preventing crime and terrorism. At the international level, four organiza-
tions have influenced the international traffic in encryption software: the Organiza-
tion for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), G-7 (the heads of state of 
the top seven industrialized countries in the world, not including Russia, which was 
suspended from participation in 2014), the European Council, and the Wassenaar 
Arrangement (which includes 41 countries that produce sensitive industrial equipment 
or weapons). Various governments have proposed schemes for controlling encryp-
tion software or at least preventing criminals from obtaining strong encryption tools 
(see Table 5.7). The U.S. and U.K. governments are also devoting a large amount of 
resources to cryptography-related programs that will enable them to break encrypted 
communications collected on the Internet. Documents leaked by former NSA con-
tractor Edward Snowden indicate that both the NSA and its U.K. counterpart, the 
GCHQ, may be able to break encryption schemes used by SSL/TLS, VPNs, and on 
4G smartphones (Vaughan-Nichols, 2013). In recent years, the fight between the U.S. 
government and technology companies over encryption has shifted to the mobile plat-
form, with Apple resisting U.S. government efforts to break Apple’s iCloud and Apple 
iPhone encryption systems (see the Chapter 8 Insight on Society case, Apple: Defender 
of Privacy?) and concerns over encryption messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Signal, 
and Telegram, that offer end-to-end encryption for texts, photos, and videos that make 
it difficult, if not impossible, for authorities to intercept communications using such 
services (Isaac, 2016).

E-COMMERCE PAYMENT SYSTEMS
For the most part, existing payment mechanisms such as cash, credit cards, debit 
cards, checking accounts, and stored value accounts have been able to be adapted to 
the online environment, albeit with some significant limitations that have led to efforts 
to develop alternatives. In addition, new types of purchasing relationships, such as 
between individuals online, and new technologies, such as the development of the 
mobile platform, have also created both a need and an opportunity for the develop-
ment of new payment systems. In this section, we provide an overview of the major 
e-commerce payment systems in use today. Table 5.8 lists some of the major trends 
in e-commerce payments in 2016–2017.
U.S. online payments represent a market of almost $600 billion in 2016, and are 
expected to grow an additional $332 billion to around $932 billion by 2020. Institu-
tions and business firms that can handle this volume of transactions (mostly the large

banking and credit firms) generally extract 2%–3% of the transactions in the form of 
fees, or about $18 billion a year in revenue. Given the size of the market, competition 
for online payments is spirited. New forms of online payment are expected to attract 
a substantial part of this growth.
In the United States, the primary form of online payment is still the existing 
credit and debit card system. Alternative payment methods such as PayPal continue 
to make inroads into traditional payment methods. Mobile payments are also expected 
to grow significantly. Figure 5.13 illustrates the percentage of consumers that use 
various alternative payment methods in 2016. However, none of these alternative 
payment methods have become substitutes for the bank and credit cards, but instead 
provide consumers with alternative methods of accessing their existing bank and 
credit accounts. 
In other parts of the world, e-commerce payments can be very different depend-
ing on traditions and infrastructure. Credit cards are not nearly as dominant a form 
of online payment as they are in the United States. If you plan on operating an 
e-commerce site in Europe, Asia, or Latin America, you will need to develop different 
payment systems for each region. For instance, in Denmark, Norway, and Finland 
payment is primarily with debit or credit cards, while in Sweden, payment after being 
tendered an invoice and by bank transfer are very popular in addition to credit/debit 
cards. In the Netherlands, the online payments service iDEAL is the most popular 
retail e-commerce payment method. In Italy, consumers rely heavily on both credit 
PayPal is still, by far, the most popular alternative payment method.

cards and PayPal. In Japan, although credit card is the primary payment method, 
many consumers still pick up and pay for goods using cash at local convenience stores 
(konbini) (eMarketer, Inc., 2015).
ONLINE CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS
Because credit and debit cards are the dominant form of online payment, it is impor-
tant to understand how they work and to recognize the strengths and weaknesses 
of this payment system. Online credit card transactions are processed in much the 
same way that in-store purchases are, with the major differences being that online 
merchants never see the actual card being used, no card impression is taken, and 
no signature is available. Online credit card transactions most closely resemble Mail 
Order-Telephone Order (MOTO) transactions. These types of purchases are also called 
Cardholder Not Present (CNP) transactions and are the major reason that charges can 
be disputed later by consumers. Because the merchant never sees the credit card, nor 
receives a hand-signed agreement to pay from the customer, when disputes arise, the 
merchant faces the risk that the transaction may be disallowed and reversed, even 
though he has already shipped the goods or the user has downloaded a digital product.
Figure 5.14 illustrates the online credit card purchasing cycle. There are five 
parties involved in an online credit card purchase: consumer, merchant, clearinghouse, 
merchant bank (sometimes called the “acquiring bank”), and the consumer’s card-
issuing bank. In order to accept payments by credit card, online merchants must have 
	 FIGURE 5.14	
HOW AN ONLINE CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION WORKS

310	
	
C H A P T E R  5     E - c o m m e r c e  S e c u r i t y  a n d  P a y m e n t  S y s t e m s 
a merchant account established with a bank or financial institution. A merchant 
account is simply a bank account that allows companies to process credit card pay-
ments and receive funds from those transactions.
As shown in Figure 5.14, an online credit card transaction begins with a purchase 
(1). When a consumer wants to make a purchase, he or she adds the item to the mer-
chant’s shopping cart. When the consumer wants to pay for the items in the shopping 
cart, a secure tunnel through the Internet is created using SSL/TLS. Using encryption, 
SSL/TLS secures the session during which credit card information will be sent to the 
merchant and protects the information from interlopers on the Internet (2). SSL does 
not authenticate either the merchant or the consumer. The transacting parties have 
to trust one another.
Once the consumer credit card information is received by the merchant, the mer-
chant software contacts a clearinghouse (3). As previously noted, a clearinghouse is a 
financial intermediary that authenticates credit cards and verifies account balances. 
The clearinghouse contacts the issuing bank to verify the account information (4). 
Once verified, the issuing bank credits the account of the merchant at the merchant’s 
bank (usually this occurs at night in a batch process) (5). The debit to the consumer 
account is transmitted to the consumer in a monthly statement (6).
Credit Card E-commerce Enablers
Companies that have a merchant account still need to buy or build a means of han-
dling the online transaction; securing the merchant account is only step one in a 
two-part process. Today, Internet payment service providers (sometimes referred to 
as payment gateways) can provide both a merchant account and the software tools 
needed to process credit card purchases online.
For instance, Authorize.net is an Internet payment service provider. The company 
helps a merchant secure an account with one of its merchant account provider part-
ners and then provides payment processing software for installation on the merchant’s 
server. The software collects the transaction information from the merchant’s site 
and then routes it via the Authorize.net “payment gateway” to the appropriate bank, 
ensuring that customers are authorized to make their purchases. The funds for the 
transaction are then transferred to the merchant’s merchant account. CyberSource is 
another well-known Internet payment service provider.
PCI-DSS Compliance
The PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry-Data Security Standard) is a data security 
standard instituted by the five major credit card companies (Visa, MasterCard, Amer-
ican Express, Discover, and JCB). PCI-DSS is not a law or governmental regulation, 
but an industry-mandated standard. Every online merchant must comply with the 
appropriate level of PCI-DSS in order to accept credit card payments. Those that fail 
to comply and are involved in a credit card breach may ultimately be subjected to 
fines and other expenses. PCI-DSS has various levels, related to the number of credit 
and/or debit cards processed by the merchant each year. Level 1, the strictest level, 
applies to very large merchants that process more than 6 million transactions a year, 
while Level 2 applies to those who process between 1 million and 6 million. Level 3

applies to organizations that process between 20,000 and 1 million transactions, while 
Level 4 applies to smaller merchants that process less than 20,000 transactions. 
PCI-DSS has six major control objectives. It requires the merchant to (a) build and 
maintain a secure network, (b) protect cardholder data, (c) maintain a vulnerability 
management program, (d) implement strong access control measures, (e) regularly 
test and monitor networks, and (f) maintain an information security policy. Each of 
these six broad control objectives has further specific requirements that must be met. 
The most current version of PCI-DSS is Version 3.1, which went into effect as of April 
2015 (PCI Security Standards Council, 2015).
Limitations of Online Credit Card Payment Systems
There are a number of limitations to the existing credit card payment system. The 
most important limitations involve security, merchant risk, administrative and trans-
action costs, and social equity.
The existing system offers poor security. Neither the merchant nor the consumer 
can be fully authenticated. The merchant could be a criminal organization designed 
to collect credit card numbers, and the consumer could be a thief using stolen or 
fraudulent cards. The risk facing merchants is high: consumers can repudiate charges 
even though the goods have been shipped or the product downloaded. The banking 
industry attempted to develop a secure electronic transaction (SET) protocol, but this 
effort failed because it was too complex for consumers and merchants alike. The rate 
of online credit card fraud is expected to reach $4 billion in 2016, up from $2 billion 
in 2011. As banks switch to EMV cards with computer chips, offline credit card fraud 
becomes more difficult, encouraging criminals to focus on online fraud (Sidel, 2016).
The administrative costs of setting up an online credit card system and becom-
ing authorized to accept credit cards are high. Transaction costs for merchants also 
are significant—roughly 3% of the purchase plus a transaction fee of 20–35 cents per 
transaction, plus other setup fees. 
Credit cards are not very democratic, even though they seem ubiquitous. Millions 
of young adults do not have credit cards, along with almost 100 million other adult 
Americans who cannot afford cards or who are considered poor risks because of low 
incomes.
ALTERNATIVE ONLINE PAYMENT SYSTEMS
The limitations of the online credit card system have opened the way for the develop-
ment of a number of alternative online payment systems. Chief among them is PayPal. 
PayPal (purchased by eBay in 2002 and then spun-off as an independent company 
again in 2015) enables individuals and businesses with e-mail accounts to make and 
receive payments up to a specified limit. Paypal is an example of an online stored 
value payment system, which permits consumers to make online payments to mer-

using PayPal, you e-mail the payment to the merchant’s PayPal account. PayPal trans-
fers the amount from your credit or checking account to the merchant’s bank account. 
The beauty of PayPal is that no personal credit information has to be shared among 
the users, and the service can be used by individuals to pay one another even in small 
amounts. However, one issue with PayPal is its relatively high cost. For example, when 
using a credit card as the source of funds, to send or request money, the cost ranges 
from 2.9% to 5.99% of the amount (depending on the type of transaction) plus a small 
fixed fee (typically $0.30) per transaction. PayPal is discussed in further depth in the 
case study at the end of the chapter.
Although PayPal is by far the most well-known and commonly used online credit/
debit card alternative, there are a number of other alternatives as well. Pay with 
Amazon is aimed at consumers who have concerns about entrusting their credit card 
information to unfamiliar online retailers. Consumers can purchase goods and ser-
vices at non-Amazon websites using the payment methods stored in their Amazon 
accounts, without having to reenter their payment information at the merchant’s site. 
Amazon provides the payment processing. Visa Checkout (formerly V.me) and Mas-
terCard’s MasterPass substitute a user name and password for an actual payment card 
number during online checkout. Both MasterPass and Visa Checkout are supported by 
a number of large payment processors and online retailers. However, they have not 
yet achieved the usage of Paypal.
Bill Me Later (owned by PayPal as well) also appeals to consumers who do not 
wish to enter their credit card information online. Bill Me Later describes itself as an 
open-ended credit account. Users select the Bill Me Later option at checkout and are 
asked to provide their birth date and the last four digits of their social security number. 
They are then billed for the purchase by Bill Me Later within 10 to 14 days. Bill Me 
Later is currently offered by more than 1,000 online merchants. 
WU Pay (formerly eBillme, and now operated by Western Union) offers a similar 
service. WU Pay customers who select the WU Pay option at firms such as Sears, 
Kmart, and other retailers do not have to provide any credit card information. Instead 
they are e-mailed a bill, which they can pay via their bank’s online bill payment 
service, or in person at any Western Union location. Dwolla is a similar cash-based 
payment network for both individuals and merchants. It bypasses the credit card 
network and instead connects directly into a bank account. In 2015, Dwolla eliminated 
its transaction and processing fees, changing its focus from consumer-to-consumer pay-
ments to larger businesses. Dwolla has its own network that bypasses the Automated 
Clearing House (ACH), the traditional system for processing financial transactions in 
the United States, and in 2015, signed up major U.S. bank BBVA Compass. Earlier in the 
year, the U.S. Treasury had selected Dwolla (along with PayPal) to process payments to 
federal agencies, and in October 2015, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange chose Dwolla 
to replace ACH. Dwolla now processes nearly $2 billion a year and has over 1 million 
accounts (Pendell, 2016; Patane, 2015; Leising, 2015). 
Like Dwolla, Stripe is another company that is attempting to provide an alterna-
tive to the traditional online credit card system. Stripe focuses on the merchant side 
of the process. It provides simple software code that enables companies to bypass 
much of the administrative costs involved in setting up an online credit card system,

and instead lets companies begin accepting credit card payments almost immedi-
ately without the need to obtain a merchant account or use a gateway provider. Stripe 
recently introduced merchant apps that can accept NFC payments. Unlike PayPal, the 
customer doesn’t need a Stripe account to pay, and all payments are made directly to 
the company rather than being routed through a third party.
MOBILE PAYMENT SYSTEMS: YOUR SMARTPHONE WALLET
The use of mobile devices as payment mechanisms is already well established in 
Europe and Asia and is now exploding in the United States, where the infrastructure 
to support mobile payment is finally being put in place. 
Near field communication (NFC) is the primary enabling technology for mobile 
payment systems. Near field communication (NFC) is a set of short-range wireless 
technologies used to share information among devices within about 2 inches of each 
other (50 mm). NFC devices are either powered or passive. A connection requires one 
powered device (the initiator, such as a smartphone), and one target device, such as a 
merchant NFC reader, that can respond to requests from the initiator. NFC targets can 
be very simple forms such as tags, stickers, key fobs, or readers. NFC peer-to-peer com-
munication is possible where both devices are powered. Consumers can swipe their 
NFC-equipped phone near a merchant’s reader to pay for purchases. In September 
2014, Apple introduced the iPhone 6, which is equipped with NFC chips designed to 
work with Apple’s mobile payments platform, Apple Pay. Building on Apple Passbook 
and Touch ID biometric fingerprint scanning and encryption that Apple previously 
introduced in September 2012, Apple Pay is able to be used for mobile payments at the 
point-of-sale at a physical store as well as online purchases using an iPhone. Other 
competitors in NFC-enabled mobile payments include Android Pay, Samsung Pay, 
PayPal, and Square. Surveys reveal that about 20%–30% of smartphone users have 
downloaded mobile wallet apps, but that only about 20% of these adopters have made 
a payment in the last month using these apps. Figure 5.15 shows that Apple and PayPal 
are the most widely used mobile payment apps among adopters of mobile wallets. The 
promise of riches beyond description to a firm that is able to dominate the mobile pay-
ments marketplace has set off what one commentator has called a goat rodeo surround-
ing the development of new technologies and methods of mobile payment. The 
end-of-chapter case study, Mobile Payment Marketplace: Goat Rodeo, provides a further 
look at the future of online and mobile payment in the United States, including the 
efforts of Apple, Google, Samsung, Square, PayPal, and major financial institutions. 
SOCIAL/MOBILE PEER-TO-PEER PAYMENT SYSTEMS
In addition to using a mobile device as a vehicle for e-commerce and as a payment 
method at physical point-of-sale, another type of mobile payment transaction is 
becoming increasingly popular: social/mobile peer-to-peer payments. Services such 
as Venmo, Square Cash, Snapcash, the newly refocused Google Wallet, and the new 
Facebook Messenger Payment service all enable users to send another person money 
through a mobile application or website, funded by a bank debit card. There is no 
charge for this service. Currently, these services are the most popular among Millen-
nials, which is the key demographic driving their growth. Venmo, owned by PayPal,

is particularly popular, with its success in part due to its integration with Facebook 
and its social network newsfeed, which lets users see when friends are paying other 
friends or paying for products and services. In 2015, Venmo processed an estimated 
$8 billion in transactions and is growing at over 200% annually. In 2016, Facebook and 
PayPal announced that Facebook subscribers could use PayPal to purchase goods and 
services, with notifications coming through Facebook Messenger. Analysts forecast 
that mobile P2P will grow to $174 billion, worth 30% of total P2P payment volume, by 
2020. That’s up from $5.6 billion, or just 1%, in 2014 (BI Intelligence, 2016).
REGULATION OF MOBILE WALLETS AND RECHARGEABLE CARDS
In October 2016, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (BCFP), a federal regu-
latory agency, issued the first regulations on what it called General Purpose Reload-
able (GPR) cards. The regulations apply to some mobile digital wallets and to physical 
cards that can be loaded with prepaid funds, as well as cards that can be purchased at 
retail locations or recharged with funds at a bank ATM or merchant point-of-sale ter-
minal (but not to gift cards purchased at retail locations). Previously, GPR cards were 
not subject to existing federal consumer banking regulations that provide protection 
from unauthorized transfers and require disclosure with respect to their terms and 
error resolution procedures. The BCFP estimates that GPR transactions grew from $1 
billion in 2003 to $65 billion in 2012, with a projected growth to $117 billion in 2019 
(BCFP, 2016). Physical GPR cards are generally sold to people who do not have a bank 
or credit account, and who use them as a substitute for a checking account and cash for 
mobile payments. Mobile digital wallets, in comparison, are typically used by people 
who already have these banking credentials. Venmo and similar peer-to-peer payment

services, as well as Android Pay and Samsung Pay, are subject to these regulations 
because they allow for the storage of prepaid funds. Apple Pay and similar wallets are 
not subject to these regulations because they do not store prepaid funds and simply act 
as an intermediary between the banks and consumers using existing bank credentials. 
The new regulations require disclosure of financial terms to consumers prior to and 
after acquisition of a prepaid account, access to periodical statements, a means for con-
sumers to correct errors in payments, consumer opt-in for over-draft and credit features, 
and a 21-day minimum repayment period. The regulations prohibit requiring customers 
to set up preauthorized electronic fund transfers to repay credit extended through an 
overdraft service or credit feature. These requirements are extensions of the existing 
Electronic Funds Transfer Act (Regulation E) and the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation 
Z) that apply to products of bank and credit institutions such as credit and debit cards. 
DIGITAL CASH AND VIRTUAL CURRENCIES
Although the terms digital cash and virtual currencies are often used synonymously, 
they actually refer to two separate types of alternative payment systems. Digital cash 
typically is based on an algorithm that generates unique authenticated tokens repre-
senting cash value that can be used “in the real world.” Bitcoin is the best known 
example of digital cash. Bitcoins are encrypted numbers (sometimes referred to as 
cryptocurrency) that are generated by a complex algorithm using a peer-to-peer 
network in a process referred to as “mining” that requires extensive computing power. 
Like real currency, Bitcoins have a fluctuating value tied to open-market trading. Like 
cash, Bitcoins are anonymous—they are exchanged via a 34-character alphanumeric 
address that the user has, and do not require any other identifying information. Bitcoins 
have recently attracted a lot of attention as a potential money laundering tool for cyber-
criminals and illicit drug markets like Silk Road, and have also been plagued by security 
issues, with some high-profile heists. Nonetheless, there are companies now using 
Bitcoins as a legitimate alternative payment system. Read the Insight on Business case, 
Bitcoin, for a further look at Bitcoin and some of the issues surrounding it. 
Virtual currencies, on the other hand, typically circulate primarily within an 
internal virtual world community, such as Linden Dollars, created by Linden Lab for 
use in its virtual world, Second Life. Virtual currencies are typically used for purchas-
ing virtual goods.

ELECTRONIC BILLING PRESENTMENT AND PAYMENT
In 2007, for the first time, the number of bill payments made online exceeded the 
number of physical checks written (Fiserv, 2007). In the $19 trillion U.S. economy with 
a $13.3 trillion consumer sector for goods and services, there are billions of bills to pay. 
According to the U.S. Postal Service, U.S. households received about 21 billion bills in 
2015 via the mail. No one knows for sure, but some experts believe the life-cycle cost 
of a paper bill for a business, from point of issuance to point of payment, ranges from 
$3 to $7. This calculation does not include the value of time to consumers, who must 
open bills, read them, write checks, address envelopes, stamp, and then mail remit-

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
BITCOIN 
In recent years, a number of coun-
tries around the world have experi-
enced banking crises, eroding trust 
in the system. Enter Bitcoin, a form 
of electronic currency that can be trans-
ferred from one person to another via peer-
to-peer networks, without the need for a bank or 
other financial institution as intermediary. This 
ability to operate outside the banking system has 
made Bitcoin a favorite of hackers and buyers 
and sellers of illicit goods and services; but more 
recently, it has made Bitcoin a darling among 
many in the technological elite who believe that 
Bitcoin and the technology behind it could be the 
next big thing in the payments industry.
Bitcoin has many unique attributes that dif-
ferentiate it from traditional currencies. Bitcoins 
are not physically minted, but are generated by 
computer software at a predetermined rate begin-
ning in 2009. A finite amount of coins are “built 
into the software,” such that in the year 2140, 
all of the coins will be mined and present in the 
market. The program that is used to generate Bit-
coins runs on a peer-to-peer network and requires 
powerful computer systems to operate. “Mining” 
a Bitcoin is the result of these powerful comput-
ers solving cryptographic problems in tandem 
with other similar computers—the computer that 
hits upon the solution is awarded the coin, and a 
record of all of the involved computers’ attempts 
at mining the coin is logged. Bitcoins derive some 
of their initial value because of the time and com-
putational effort required to mine them. 
There are, however, many reasons to be skep-
tical of Bitcoin. Although law enforcement has 
improved its ability to apprehend criminals using 
Bitcoin, including the founder of the online black 
market Silk Road in 2015, governments are jus-
tifiably concerned about the emergence of a new 
currency without any tangible form whose purpose 
is to avoid regulation. Bitcoin has also been lauded 
for its democratic structure, under which anyone 
running the underlying software has a say in 
making future changes. However, in 2016, Bitcoin 
is embroiled in a bitter civil war. As the currency 
continues to gain in popularity, limits on the Bitcoin 
transactions that can be processed each second, 
originally imposed as a safeguard, have begun to 
create backlogs and cripple transaction speed. 
Some of Bitcoin’s long-time supporters want to 
raise these limits to bring Bitcoin processing speed 
in line with services like PayPal; others argue that 
doing so could abandon the decentralized nature 
of the currency and place Bitcoin in the control of 
the few companies with the computing power to 
handle such a significant load, and out of the hands 
of the people. In 2016, there are now competing 
versions of Bitcoin, one which has removed transac-
tion limits, and the other which remains faithful to 
the currency’s original vision, poor processing speed 
notwithstanding. Because of Bitcoin’s uncertain-
ties and legal quandaries, the governments of many 
countries, including China, Denmark, Russia, and 
Israel, have taken a firm stand against digital cash. 
Each of these developments has put downward 
pressure on Bitcoin’s value and slowed its growth, 
although Chinese exchanges accounted for 42% of 
all Bitcoin transactions in 2016, suggesting that 
China’s attempts to limit Bitcoin’s usage have been 
unsuccessful. A 2015 analysis of Bitcoin usage 
suggested that Bitcoins are still used primarily for 
gambling, illicit goods, and hoarding by speculators. 
Security concerns have also ravaged the largest 
Bitcoin exchanges to date, including Mt. Gox and 
Flexcoin. Hackers stole $425 million and $600,000 
in Bitcoins from the two exchanges, respectively, 
and in 2016 the identity of the thieves and location 
of the Bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox is still shrouded 
in mystery. These regulatory pressures and security 
concerns have driven Bitcoin’s dizzying volatility. 

In 2012, Bitcoin’s value was $6; in 2013, it rose to 
$1,200; and in 2016, it has surged back to $650 
after plummeting to nearly $200 in 2015.
Despite all of these drawbacks, Bitcoin con-
tinues to move forward, and more banks and 
regulators are recognizing that the underlying 
technology may be here to stay. In 2015, Goldman 
Sachs invested heavily in Circle Internet Financial, 
a Bitcoin peer-to-peer payment platform, noting 
that Bitcoin could gain international acceptance 
over time. In September 2015, New York issued 
the first license to operate a virtual currency busi-
ness, called a BitLicense, to Circle Internet, giving 
it the right to operate in the state, while subject-
ing it to strict capital, consumer protection, and 
anti-money laundering requirements. Many large 
U.S. banks, the New York Stock Exchange, Japa-
nese telecom giant DoCoMo, the Bank of Tokyo, 
and other companies have invested in Coinbase, 
an intermediary for Bitcoin transactions. The first 
Bitcoin bank and the first Bitcoin investment 
fund launched in 2015 and the IRS began taxing 
Bitcoin earnings, further legitimizing it in the eyes 
of regulators. The EU, Japan, and a host of other 
countries proposed rules for the regulation, use, 
and trading of virtual currencies in 2016. 
Companies like Circle Internet Financial 
hope to harness Bitcoin’s decentralized network 
of computers to enable frictionless and inexpen-
sive movement of currencies across international 
borders. Bitcoins and Bitcoin transactions are 
all logged on a public ledger known as the block-
chain, which is updated and maintained by 
all of the members of the network. Contrast 
this with a bank, which is a central hub where 
all currency and financial information resides. 
With the blockchain, there isn’t a single point 
of failure or vulnerability the way there may be 
with a bank, and no single entity must update 
and maintain the ledger. For Bitcoin to truly gain 
acceptance, regular people will need to begin using 
it for everyday transactions. In countries where 
the banking system is less developed than in the 
United States, this has already begun to happen. 
In Argentina, the Philippines, Kenya, and other 
similar countries, banking regulations have made 
Bitcoin a more appealing alternative for ordinary 
people making normal commercial transactions.
A number of high-profile online businesses 
accept Bitcoin, such as Dell, Microsoft Expedia, 
and Newegg, as well as reportedly over 80,000 
other merchants around the world. Bitcoin trading 
volume is still down significantly from its peak in 
2014, but by July 2016, volume had spiked up 
again. Industry analysts predict that the number 
of active Bitcoin users will grow to 4.7 million in 
2019, up from roughly 1.3 million today. Analysts 
also believe that the number of transactions per 
day will grow to 200,000 per day in 2016, with 
a value of more than $92 billion, up from $27 
billion in 2015. For Bitcoin to continue to grow, 
however, it must become more than just a trading 
commodity and prove itself to be a useful tool to 
actually purchase goods and services.

tances. The billing market represents an extraordinary opportunity for using the Inter-
net as an electronic billing and payment system that potentially could greatly reduce 
both the cost of paying bills and the time consumers spend paying them. Estimates 
vary, but online payments are believed to cost between only 20 to 30 cents to process.
Electronic billing presentment and payment (EBPP) systems are systems 
that enable the online delivery and payment of monthly bills. EBPP services allow 
consumers to view bills electronically using either their desktop PC or mobile device 
and pay them through electronic funds transfers from bank or credit card accounts. 
More and more companies are choosing to issue statements and bills electronically, 
rather than mailing out paper versions, especially for recurring bills such as utilities, 
insurance, and subscriptions. 
MARKET SIZE AND GROWTH
In 2002, 61% of bill payments were made by check, and only 12% by online bill pay-
ments. In 2015, in contrast, online bill payments accounted for more than 55% of 
all bill payments, while paper checks now account for less than 20%. Among online 
households, almost three-quarters pay at least one bill online each month, and almost 
half receive at least one bill electronically each month. Mobile bill payments are 
surging, with 33% U.S. households in 2015 paying at least one bill on a mobile device. 
Most consumers cited the convenience and time saved by using mobile bill payment 
(Fiserv, 2016). 
One major reason for the surge in EBPP usage is that companies are starting to 
realize how much money they can save through online billing. Not only is there the 
savings in postage and processing, but payments can be received more quickly (3 to 
12 days faster, compared to paper bills sent via regular mail), thereby improving cash 
flow. Online bill payment options can also reduce the number of phone calls to a 
company’s customer service line. In order to realize these savings, many companies 
are becoming more aggressive in encouraging their customers to move to EBPP by 
instituting a charge for the privilege of continuing to receive a paper bill.
Financials don’t tell the whole story, however. Companies are discovering that 
a bill is both a sales opportunity and a customer retention opportunity, and that the 
electronic medium provides many more options when it comes to marketing and 
promotion. Rebates, savings offers, cross-selling, and upselling are all possible in the 
digital realm, and much less expensive than mailed envelopes stuffed with offers.
EBPP BUSINESS MODELS
There are four EBPP business models: online banking, biller-direct, mobile, and con-
solidator. 
The online banking model is the most widely used today. Consumers share their 
banking or credit card credentials with the merchant and authorize the merchant to 
charge the consumer’s bank account. This model has the advantage of convenience 
for the consumer because the payments are deducted automatically, usually with a 
notice from the bank or the merchant that their account has been debited. 
In the biller-direct model, consumers are sent bills by e-mail notification, and go 
to the merchant’s website to make payments using their banking credentials. This 
electronic billing 
presentment and 
payment (EBPP) 
system
form of online payment 
system for monthly bills

model has the advantage of allowing the merchant to engage with the consumer by 
sending coupons or rewards. The biller-direct model is a two-step process, and less 
convenient for consumers. 
The mobile model allows consumers to make payments using mobile apps, once 
again relying on their bank credentials as the source of funds. Consumers are noti-
fied of a bill by text message and authorize the payment. An extension of this is the 
social-mobile model, where social networks like Facebook integrate payment into their 
messaging services. The mobile model has several advantages, not least of which is 
the convenience for consumers of paying bills while using their phones, but also the 
speed with which bills can be paid in a single step. This is the fastest growing form of 
EBPP. In 2016, Facebook and PayPal announced a deal in which Facebook users can 
pay for purchases on Facebook using PayPal (Demos, 2016). Consumers will not have 
to leave Facebook in order to purchase and pay for products. 
In the consolidator model, a third party, such as a financial institution or a focused 
portal such as Intuit’s Paytrust, Fiserv’s MyCheckFree, Mint Bills, and others, aggre-
gates all bills for consumers and permits one-stop bill payment. This model has the 
advantage of allowing consumers to see all their bills at one website or app. However, 
because bills come due at different times, consumers need to check their portals often. 
The consolidator model faces several challenges. For billers, using the consolidator 
model means an increased time lag between billing and payment, and also inserts an 
intermediary between the company and its customer. 
Supporting these primary business models are infrastructure providers such as 
Fiserv, Yodlee, FIS Global, ACI Worldwide, MasterCard RPPS (Remote Payment and 
Presentment Service), and others that provide the software to create the EBPP system 
or handle billing and payment collection for the biller. Figure 5.16 categorizes the 
major players in the EBPP marketspace.

Goat Rodeo
N
early every day, it seems, a new mobile payment system is announced 
by giant tech companies, startups, merchants, and banks. The mobile 
payment marketplace is experiencing an explosion of innovative ideas,

payment market is expected to generate to somewhere between $27 billion and $75 
billion in transaction volume in 2016, more than doubling the 2015 number. This wide-

actions and banking using a smartphone. Times are changing: for the first time, more 
people are using mobile banking on their phones and laptops than going to a bank branch. 
American consumers spent over $5.1 trillion on credit and debit card transactions 
in 2015, and mobile payments are still just a tiny percentage of the existing credit and 
debit card system. But even if a small percentage of the $5 trillion credit card transac-
tions move from plastic to mobile, the potential revenue is very large. On the other 
hand, moving consumers away from over 800 million credit and debit cards, which can 
be swiped at millions of merchants and used online with ease and safety, is proving to 
be a difficult task. The rosy future of mobile payments painted by tech companies may 
be a long time coming. 
The mobile payment market is a battle among the titans of online payment and 
retailing: PayPal, credit card companies like Visa and MasterCard, Google, Apple, 
Samsung, and startup tech companies like Venmo and Square. The startups are backed 
by millions in venture capital. Even large retailers like Walmart, Best Buy, and Target 
are getting into the game by developing their own mobile payment apps. Major banks 
are in the line of fire: who needs a checking account when you can pay with a mobile 
phone? Rising to this challenge, the banks are slowly building their own mobile 
payment systems, and investing in startups to lead the charge. 
There are, by one count, already about 8,000 startups in the mobile payment 
market. The most recent startups focus on peer-to-peer mobile payments. Venmo is a 
good example. Venmo is a social-mobile payment app that lets users transfer money to 
one another. It can also be used to pay at a small number of participating merchants. 
Founded in 2010 by two college students who wanted to send cash to one another for 
sharing restaurant tabs and paying small debts without the hassle of cash or writing 
checks, Venmo was purchased by PayPal in 2013. Users sign up for a Venmo account 
and link their account to a bank account, a debit card, or credit card. Users can also 
create a Venmo balance by sending money to their Venmo account, and then charge 
payments against that balance. There is no charge for the service when users have 
a Venmo balance or use a debit card, and a 3% charge for using a credit card as the 
source of funds. There is a social aspect of Venmo that allows users to share their pur-
chase events (but with amount paid stripped from the notification). Users have the 
option to keep all transactions private as well. When they want to make a payment 
to another person, they enter the person’s e-mail and the funds are transferred when 
the recipient, who must also have a Venmo account, accepts the payment. Venmo 
relies on NFC technology to make in-person payments to individuals by tapping their 
phones. Venmo’s popularity has skyrocketed, especially among Millennials, and in 
January 2016 it processed $1 billion in transactions, a 250% increase over the previous 
year. The company does not release information on its subscriber base, and because 
it is largely a free service, it does not contribute significantly to PayPal’s gross rev-
enues. PayPal has begun to monetize its investment in Venmo by expanding beyond 
peer-to-peer small payments, and extending its use to merchants who accept PayPal 
payments, a much larger user base, which includes large retailers like Home Depot, 
Target, Sears, and OfficeMax. 
Startups like Venmo are small fry compared to the three other giants in the mobile 
payment market. First in terms of subscribers are the technology companies like

Apple, Google, Samsung, PayPal, and Square, all of which have major hardware and 
software mobile payment initiatives. Apple, Google, and Samsung own and license 
the hardware and software platform of the ubiquitous smartphone, while PayPal and 
Square operate large-scale payment processing platforms. Second, the large national 
merchants are developing their own mobile payment systems in an effort, in part, 
to sidestep the credit card companies (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American 
Express), which charge them a 3% transaction fee that gets passed along to the con-
sumer as 3% higher prices, and in part to maintain control over the point-of-sale 
consumer moment at the cash register. These firms have tens of millions of loyal 
customers. Banks like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citi, and other money center 
banks, and of course, the credit card companies Visa, Master Card, and others, are 
the third major player. These firms have the advantage of owning and operating the 
global banking and credit card systems, with hundreds of millions of loyal banking 
and credit card customers, and the expertise to provide security and financial stabil-
ity for their products. They are, however, very slow movers and are just now entering 
the mobile payment marketplace. 
Let’s take a look at the technology companies first, all of whom offer variations 
on contactless payments, often referred to as digital or mobile wallets. Apple Pay is an 
app that comes with iPhone 6 phones and later. It uses built-in NFC technology. Users 
set up an account, and enter their banking credentials, using either their credit/debit 
card account information, or their checking or savings account, as the source of funds. 
When a customer wants to make a payment, he or she presses the iPhone Touch 
ID button, which reads the customer’s fingerprint and ensures the phone does indeed 
belong to the person. On the Apple Watch, there’s a special button just for Apple Pay 
transactions. Next, the consumer swipes the device near a merchant’s NFC point-of-
sale terminal, which begins the transaction process. The iPhone 6 and later comes with 
a hardware-defined secure area on a chip that contains a unique device number and 
the ability to generate a one-time 16-digit code. Together they form a digital token. The 
token information is encrypted and sent to Apple servers to verify the authenticity of 
the device and the person. Apple sends the payment request to the credit card issuer. 
Credit card issuers verify the account owner and available credit. In about one second, 
the transaction is approved or denied. Credit card information is not shared with the 
merchant and not transmitted from the iPhone. The 800 million credit cards stored 
on Apple’s servers are also encrypted. If hackers intercept the NFC communication 
at the point-of-sale, or intercept the stream of data moving over the cellular network, 
it would be useless, and incapable of supporting additional transactions because the 
message is encrypted, and involves a one-time-only digital token. 
Apple Pay is free to consumers, and the credit card companies charge their usual 
fee of 3% for each transaction. Apple collects .15% from the credit companies and 
banks, and in return, guarantees the transaction is valid. Apple Pay does not store 
any user funds and is solely a technology-based intermediary between consumers and 
banks, and, unlike Venmo, is not subject to federal banking regulations. Merchants’ 
point-of-sale terminals need to be NFC-enabled, and merchants need to install Apple 
software to accept payments. Apple Pay can be used by any consumer that has a credit 
card from a major issuer bank.

Apple has developed relationships with many of the key players in the payment 
ecosystem, including credit giants Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Dis-
cover, as well as 11 large bank credit card issuers including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of 
America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, which together account for 83% of U.S. credit 
card payment volume. Apple has also signed up national merchants such as Walgreens, 
Duane Reade, McDonald’s, Disney, Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s, Staples, and Whole Foods. 
Groupon and Uber have integrated Apple Pay into their systems.
Android Pay is a Google app that provides an NFC-based payment system much 
like Apple Pay. Android is the most widely used smartphone operating system in 
the world. Launched in 2015, Android Pay replaces Google Wallet, which has been 
repurposed as a peer-to-peer payment service that allows users to pay friends using 
only their e-mail address, similar to PayPal and Venmo. Users sign up for an Android 
Pay account by entering their existing bank credit or debit card account information, 
or by depositing a prepaid balance of funds in their Android Pay account. Google is 
for some users a prepaid digital card where users transfer funds to their Android Pay 
account, and therefore is subject to federal regulations. To use Android Pay, custom-
ers hold their phone near the merchant’s NFC terminal at checkout. Users are asked 
to enter their PIN and then choose to pay with either the credit or debit card on file 
with Android Pay or with their cash balance. If the user chooses to pay with a bank 
card, the app creates a unique digital token and sends this as an encrypted message 
to Android servers, which then communicate with the issuing bank, for approval. 
Approval messages are sent to the merchant’s point-of-sale terminal. No card infor-
mation is transmitted from the point of purchase. Android Pay is free for subscribers 
except when they use their credit card, which entails a 3% credit card transaction fee 
charged by the credit card companies. However, Google may offer consumers rewards, 
and in the future, display ads. Because Android Pay can store user funds, it is subject 
to federal banking regulations. 
Samsung Pay was introduced by Samsung in the United States in September 2015, 
after an earlier roll-out in Samsung’s home country, South Korea. Samsung smart-
phones are the most widely used smartphones in the world. As with Apple Pay and 
Android Pay, users create an account, and submit their bank credit or debit card infor-
mation. Samsung Pay prioritizes the use of NFC technology when merchants have the 
appropriate terminal, but when that is not available, switches to a technology called 
Magnetic Secure Transmission that sends the card data stored on the user’s device to 
traditional magnetic stripe terminals. This means that Samsung Pay can be used by 
the millions of existing point-of-sale card swiping terminals without upgrading to NFC 
terminals or installing any apps. Samsung Pay also stores coupons and reward cards, 
but does not store user funds and is not a prepaid card. Therefore, it most likely will 
not be subject to U.S. federal regulations. Like the other mobile wallets, it is essentially 
a place where users can store all their credit cards. 
Currently, the most popular mobile payment systems are offered by PayPal and 
Square, some of which do not use NFC. While claiming to be financial services firms, 
both PayPal and Square are financial service software platform firms, technology 
companies in disguise. PayPal was late to the mobile payment market, beaten to the 
punch by Square. Square started in 2009 with Square Reader, a square plastic device

that plugged into an iPhone or iPad, and allowed users to easily set up a merchant 
license to accept credit cards, and then swipe the cards locally on the Square Reader 
device. Using the Square app, it allows merchants to easily accept credit card payments 
from customers on the go. Square also developed Square Register (now called Point 
of Sale), which is a software app that turns a tablet into a point-of-sale terminal and 
cash register. Square has morphed into a small business services company, serving 
coffee shops, newsstands, small retailers, and farmers’ market merchants, as well as 
piano teachers, baby sitters, and taxi drivers, allowing them to easily accept credit 
card payments. Square generated $1 billion in revenue in 2015, and showed a loss of 
$174 million. 
PayPal is currently the most successful and profitable non-traditional online 
payment system, used mostly on desktops and tablets, but rapidly becoming a mobile 
payment force. PayPal is currently the largest alternative (non-credit card) online 
payment service, processing $282 billion in transactions in 2015, and has 188 million 
subscribers. PayPal processed $66 billion in mobile payments in 2015, up from $27 
billion in 2013. PayPal is growing payment volume at around 20% annually. 
PayPal currently enables mobile payments in three ways. First, PayPal sells a 
device that allows merchants (mostly small businesses) to swipe credit cards using a 
smartphone or tablet, just like the Square device. Second, the most common PayPal 
mobile payment occurs when customers use their mobile device browser on a tablet 
or smartphone to make a purchase or payment at a website. This is not very helpful 
for merchants like Starbucks, Macys, or local restaurants, who would like customers to 
be able to purchase goods in their stores and outlets on the fly without keying in infor-
mation to a smartphone. A third method is PayPal’s updated app for iOS and Android 
devices. On entering a merchant’s store that accepts PayPal app payments, the app 
establishes a link using Bluetooth with the merchant’s app that is also running on an 
iOS or Android device. This step authenticates the user’s PayPal account. On checkout, 
the customer tells the merchant he or she will pay with PayPal. The merchant app 
charges the customer’s PayPal account. After the payment is authorized, a message 
is sent to the customer’s phone. No credit card information is being transmitted or 
shared with the merchant. Users do not have to enter a pin code or swipe their phone 
at a special merchant device, so merchants are not required to purchase an expensive 
NFC point-of-sale device, but they must have the PayPal merchant app stored on a 
PC which is really acting like a digital cash register. In 2012, PayPal launched PayPal 
Here, a device that will both read credit cards equipped with computer chips, as well 
as accept payments from Android Pay and Apple Pay. The service includes a card 
reader that plugs into a tablet or smartphone, and a stand-alone contactless device that 
can accept NFC payments, as well as swipe credit cards. In 2015, PayPal launched the 
PayPal.me app, a peer-to-peer payment service that allows users to make and receive 
payments from friends. Users share their PayPal.me link with friends and can transfer 
money to their PayPal accounts. The service is free and is a direct competitor with 
Venmo and other P2P payment services. Venmo, which PayPal also owns, only works 
with U.S. banks, credit and debit cards, while PayPal.me is targeted at PayPal’s global 
user base. In 2016 PayPal launched NFC payments for locations that accept VISA’s 
contactless payments.

While mobile payment systems developed by technology companies are experi-
encing rapid growth, mobile wallets developed by large national merchants have sput-
tered. Large national merchants have had a contentious relationship with credit card 
firms because of the 3% fees charged by credit card companies, which raise prices to 
consumers by the same amount. Merchants would much prefer customers pay with 
store credit cards that are linked to the customer’s bank account, or debit accounts, 
where banks do not charge a fee, or customer-supplied prepayment funds. Some mer-
chants also offer their own store credit cards and have developed their own transaction 
processing systems, circumventing the bank credit card system entirely. Merchants 
also want to control the point-of-sale moment, where they can offer coupons, loyalty 
rewards, and special discounts, rather than rely on mobile wallets provided by the 
technology companies, which do not offer these capabilities. 
In 2012, a joint venture of the 15 largest merchants announced the Merchant Cus-
tomer Exchange (MCX). MCX was backed by Walmart, Target, Sears, 7-Eleven, Sunoco, 
and 10 other national pharmacies, supermarkets, and restaurant chains. The backers of 
this effort have annual sales of more than $1 trillion dollars. That was enough to make 
everyone involved in mobile payments stand up and listen, even Google and Apple. 
Their initial effort was coined CurrentC, and was piloted in 2014. CurrentC was an app 
that allowed customers to pay using their bank accounts, bank debit cards, or store-
issued credit cards, but not traditional bank credit cards. The idea was to circumvent 
the bank credit system entirely, and avoid paying the credit companies their typical 
3% fee. CurrentC was withdrawn in 2016, and the MCX joint venture has ended due 
to squabbles among the partners, and an excessively long development time for the 
app. In 2016, Walmart introduced its own Walmart Pay app for both iOS and Android 
phones. Using QR recognition technology, not NFC, Walmart Pay now accepts all bank 
credit and debit cards, as well as Walmart store credit cards. It can also read coupons 
and offer rewards to loyal customers. Walmart Pay can only be used at Walmart stores, 
but given that Walmart has 140 million customers a week in the United States, that’s 
not a terrible disadvantage. As of October 2016, 22 million customers are using the 
Walmart Pay app every month. The advantage to Walmart is that it owns the customer 
transaction, and information, without the intervention of the tech giants. Walmart, and 
the other large national merchants, will have to live with the credit card companies 
and their 3% fees for now. 
The third entrant to the mobile payment market is composed of the large national 
banks and credit card companies. Banks and credit card firms have been very slow 
moving into the mobile payment space, in part because the existing credit system 
works so well and their cards are widely accepted by consumers and merchants. 
Mobile payment systems from tech companies and merchants are competitors for the 
loyalty of bank customers who deposit billions of dollars in bank checking, savings, and 
debit cards, where banks can charge fees, and use the deposits essentially free of cost, 
given the low or non-existent interest rates on these accounts. JP Morgan Chase has 
launched Retail Checkout, a card reader that accepts tap card and mobile wallet NFC 
payments, and the Chase Mobile app for smartphones and tablets, which allows bank 
customers to perform a wide variety of banking functions like peer-to-peer payments 
by e-mail (QuickPay), pay bills, deposit checks, check balances, and even apply for

mortgages. Citi has launched Citi Mobile with similar functionality. Banks so far have 
not introduced apps for making NFC payments for consumer purchases, but these 
will surely be introduced shortly. The large banks are investing heavily in payment 
startups to acquire these capabilities. 
The future for smartphone mobile wallets is assured given the size of the players 
involved, the potential rewards for successful players, and the demands of consumers 
for a payment system that does not involve swiping plastic cards, dealing with slips of 
paper receipts, and digging for cash in their pockets and purses. 
But the transition is going much slower than pundits initially thought, with mil-
lions of consumers trying the new methods once, and then not using them again 
because not enough merchants accept them, lack of familiarity, and concerns about 
security and privacy. One recent study found there are now 11 million contactless 
mobile payment users in the United States, but just 2.3 million who are active users. It 
is unlikely that all the mobile payment systems described above will survive, and also 
quite likely that consumers will remain confused by all their payment options for some 
time yet to come. A full transition to mobile payments will be a long time coming.

Understand the scope of e-commerce crime and security problems, the key dimensions of e-commerce security, and the 
tension between security and other values.
•	
While the overall size of cybercrime is unclear, cybercrime against e-commerce sites is growing rapidly, 
the amount of losses is growing, and the management of e-commerce sites must prepare for a variety of 
criminal assaults.

There are six key dimensions to e-commerce security: integrity, nonrepudiation, authenticity, confidenti-
ality, privacy, and availability.

Although computer security is considered necessary to protect e-commerce activities, it is not without a 
downside. Two major areas where there are tensions between security and website operations are:

Ease of use—The more security measures that are added to an e-commerce site, the more difficult it 
is to use and the slower the site becomes, hampering ease of use. Security is purchased at the price

of slowing down processors and adding significantly to data storage demands. Too much security can 
harm profitability, while not enough can potentially put a company out of business.
•	
Public safety—There is a tension between the claims of individuals to act anonymously and the needs 
of public officials to maintain public safety that can be threatened by criminals or terrorists.
Identify the key security threats in the e-commerce environment 
•	
The most common and most damaging forms of security threats to e-commerce sites include:
•	
Malicious code—viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, and bot networks are a threat to a sys-
tem’s integrity and continued operation, often changing how a system functions or altering docu-
ments created on the system.
•	
Potentially unwanted programs (adware, spyware, etc.)—a kind of security threat that arises when pro-
grams are surreptitiously installed on your computer or computer network without your consent.
•	
Phishing—any deceptive, online attempt by a third party to obtain confidential information for finan-
cial gain.
•	
Hacking and cybervandalism—intentionally disrupting, defacing, or even destroying a site.
•	
Credit card fraud/theft—one of the most-feared occurrences and one of the main reasons more con-
sumers do not participate in e-commerce. The most common cause of credit card fraud is a lost or 
stolen card that is used by someone else, followed by employee theft of customer numbers and sto-
len identities (criminals applying for credit cards using false identities).
•	
Identity fraud—involves the unauthorized use of another person’s personal data, such as social secu-
rity, driver’s license, and/or credit card numbers, as well as user names and passwords, for illegal 
financial benefit. 
•	
Spoofing—occurs when hackers attempt to hide their true identities or misrepresent themselves by 
using fake e-mail addresses or masquerading as someone else.
•	
Pharming—involves redirecting a web link to an address different from the intended one, with the 
site masquerading as the intended destination.
•	
Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks—hackers flood a website with 
useless traffic to inundate and overwhelm the network, frequently causing it to shut down and dam-
aging a site’s reputation and customer relationships.
•	
Sniffing—a type of eavesdropping program that monitors information traveling over a network, 
enabling hackers to steal proprietary information from anywhere on a network, including e-mail 
messages, company files, and confidential reports. The threat of sniffing is that confidential or per-
sonal information will be made public.
•	
Insider jobs—although the bulk of Internet security efforts are focused on keeping outsiders out, the 
biggest threat is from employees who have access to sensitive information and procedures.
•	
Poorly designed server and client software—the increase in complexity and size of software programs 
has contributed to an increase in software flaws or vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit.
•	
Social network security issues—malicious code, PUPs, phishing, data breaches, identity fraud, and 
other e-commerce security threats have all infiltrated social networks.
•	
Mobile platform security issues—the mobile platform presents an alluring target for hackers and cyber-
criminals, and faces all the same risks as other Internet devices, as well as new risks associated with 
wireless network security.
•	
Cloud security issues—as devices, identities, and data become more and more intertwined in the 
cloud, safeguarding data in the cloud becomes a major concern.
Describe how technology helps secure Internet communications channels and protect networks, servers, and clients.
•	
Encryption is the process of transforming plain text or data into cipher text that cannot be read by anyone 
other than the sender and the receiver. Encryption can provide four of the six key dimensions of e-com-
merce security: message integrity, nonrepudiation, authentication, and confidentiality.

•	
There are a variety of different forms of encryption technology currently in use. They include:
•	
Symmetric key cryptography—Both the sender and the receiver use the same key to encrypt and 
decrypt a message. 
•	
Public key cryptography—Two mathematically related digital keys are used: a public key and a private 
key. The private key is kept secret by the owner, and the public key is widely disseminated. Both 
keys can be used to encrypt and decrypt a message. Once the keys are used to encrypt a message, 
the same keys cannot be used to unencrypt the message.
•	
Public key cryptography using digital signatures and hash digests—This method uses a mathematical 
algorithm called a hash function to produce a fixed-length number called a hash digest. The results 
of applying the hash function are sent by the sender to the recipient. Upon receipt, the recipient 
applies the hash function to the received message and checks to verify that the same result is pro-
duced. The sender then encrypts both the hash result and the original message using the recipient’s 
public key, producing a single block of cipher text. To ensure both the authenticity of the message 
and nonrepudiation, the sender encrypts the entire block of cipher text one more time using the 
sender’s private key. This produces a digital signature or “signed” cipher text that can be sent over 
the Internet to ensure the confidentiality of the message and authenticate the sender.
•	
Digital envelope—This method uses symmetric cryptography to encrypt and decrypt the document, 
but public key cryptography to encrypt and send the symmetric key.
•	
Digital certificates and public key infrastructure—This method relies on certification authorities who 
issue, verify, and guarantee digital certificates (a digital document that contains the name of the 
subject or company, the subject’s public key, a digital certificate serial number, an expiration date, 
an issuance date, the digital signature of the certification authority, and other identifying informa-
tion).
•	
In addition to encryption, there are several other tools that are used to secure Internet channels of com-
munication, including: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS), virtual private net-
works (VPNs), and wireless security standards such as WPA2.
•	
After communications channels are secured, tools to protect networks, the servers, and clients should be 
implemented. These include: firewalls, proxies, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IDP), 
operating system controls, and anti-virus software.
Appreciate the importance of policies, procedures, and laws in creating security.
•	
In order to minimize security threats, e-commerce firms must develop a coherent corporate policy that 
takes into account the nature of the risks, the information assets that need protecting, and the procedures 
and technologies required to address the risk, as well as implementation and auditing mechanisms.
•	
Public laws and active enforcement of cybercrime statutes also are required to both raise the costs of 
illegal behavior on the Internet and guard against corporate abuse of information.
•	
The key steps in developing a security plan are:
•	
Perform a risk assessment—an assessment of the risks and points of vulnerability.
•	
Develop a security policy—a set of statements prioritizing the information risks, identifying acceptable 
risk targets, and identifying the mechanisms for achieving these targets.
•	
Create an implementation plan—a plan that determines how you will translate the levels of acceptable 
risk into a set of tools, technologies, policies, and procedures.
•	
Create a security team—the individuals who will be responsible for ongoing maintenance, audits, and 
improvements.
•	
Perform periodic security audits—routine reviews of access logs and any unusual patterns of activity.
Identify the major e-commerce payment systems in use today.
•	
The major types of e-commerce payment systems in use today include:

	
R e v i e w

329
•	
Online credit card transactions, which are the primary form of online payment system. There are five 
parties involved in an online credit card purchase: consumer, merchant, clearinghouse, merchant 
bank (sometimes called the “acquiring bank”), and the consumer’s card-issuing bank. However, the 
online credit card system has a number of limitations involving security, merchant risk, cost, and 
social equity.
•	
PayPal, which is an example of an alternative payment system that permits consumers to make 
instant, online payments to merchants and other individuals based on value stored in an online 
account. Other examples include Pay with Amazon, Visa Checkout, MasterPass, Bill Me Later, and 
WU Pay.
•	
Mobile payment systems, which use either credit card readers attached to a smartphone (Square, Pay-
Pal Here) or near field communication (NFC) chips, which enable mobile payment at point-of-sale 
(Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay).
•	
Digital cash, such as Bitcoin and virtual currencies. Digital cash is growing in importance and can be 
used to hide payments from authorities, as well as support the legitimate exchange of value.
Describe the features and functionality of electronic billing presentment and payment systems.
•	
Electronic billing presentment and payment (EBPP) systems are a form of online payment systems for 
monthly bills. EBPP services allow consumers to view bills electronically and pay them through elec-
tronic funds transfers from bank or credit card accounts. 
•	
Major players in the EBPP marketspace include: online banking, biller-direct systems, mobile payment 
systems, and consolidators.

T
he age of online video ads is upon 
us, just in case you haven’t noticed. 
Improvements in video production 
tools, higher bandwidth, and better streaming quality 
have fueled an online video surge. Video produc-
tion is no longer the exclusive province of just a 
few major players in New York and Hollywood, but 
instead has expanded to a much larger group of 
potential creators, including users themselves. In 
addition, the ways online video can be viewed have 
also expanded, from desktop PCs and laptops to 
smartphones, tablet computers, netbooks, and web-
enabled television sets. 
The online audience for videos is huge. Over 215 
million Americans (over two-thirds of the general 
population) watch online video content on a desktop 
computer, smartphone, or tablet at least once a month. Google Sites (YouTube) is the top 
online video content site, with almost 160 million unique viewers, followed by Facebook, 
Yahoo Sites, and Microsoft Sites. 
Because this is where the eyeballs are, video has become an obvious advertising 
medium. And just in time: Internet users have learned how to avoid traditional banner 
ads by instinctively moving their eyes to a different part of the screen. Click-throughs on 
banner ads are miniscule (less than 1 click per 1000 impressions) but videos are another 
story. Click-through rates for video ads on desktops are more than 5 times higher than 
for display ads, and the click-through rate is even higher for video ads on tablets and 
smartphones. In addition, nearly 100% of online spenders are video viewers, and they 
provide a highly desirable demographic with strong buying power. Research by comScore 
has found that retail site viewers who view videos are 64% more likely to purchase. As 
a result, advertisers are jumping on the bandwagon. AOL is the leading video advertising 
platform, reaching over 46% of the total U.S. population. Google Sites reaches about 
33% of the population.
Many large firms have moved into the online video advertising marketplace with 
sophisticated campaigns and big budgets. As of June 2016, the top 100 global brands 
collectively have over 3,000 YouTube channels with over 850,000 videos that have at-
tracted more than 63 billion views. Interest in online ads posted on YouTube has exploded, 
with the number of views increasing by over 50% between June 2015 and June 2016. In 
fact, two of the top five trending videos on YouTube for all of 2015 were branded online

advertising content. Collectively, the channels have over 100 million subscribers, who are 
actively engaging with the content, generating 145 million Likes (as well as about 15 
million Dislikes). 
Smaller firms are also posting video ads on YouTube. Orabrush is an example of a 
small firm that successfully used video ads on YouTube to build its business from the 
ground up. Dr. Robert Wagstaff, a dentist who invented a breath-freshening tongue cleaner, 
was unsuccessful marketing it through traditional channels. Jeffrey Harmon, an MBA 
student at nearby Brigham Young University, whom Wagstaff had hired on a part-time 
basis, convinced him to give video ads a try. He initially posted a YouTube video called 
“How to tell if you have bad breath” on Orabrush’s landing page, and found that it tripled 
Orabrush’s conversion rate. From there, they decided to create Orabrush’s own YouTube 
video channel. Today the channel has 120 videos, around 180,000 subscribers, and more 
than 52 million video views (more than major brands such as Colgate and Johnson & 
Johnson), and more importantly, has resulted in sales of over 3 million units. Orapup, a 
sister brand for dogs, has also used the same kind of video marketing model with great 
success, connecting with the pet community and generating more than 25 million views, 
more than major pet brands Purina, Pedigree, and Iams, combined. In 2015, Orabrush 
spun off a new ad technology company named Molio, which is aimed at using proprietary 
systems to leverage its YouTube marketing model and acting as a consultant to other 
companies. Initial clients include Wilson Golf’s line of Duo golf balls and Stride bicycles. 
The Orabrush product line was acquired by Dentek in March 2015.
One of the reasons why advertisers are flocking to place online ads on YouTube is the 
TrueView ad format, which is available on both the desktop and mobile devices. Launched 
in 2010, TrueView ads allow viewers to skip the ad after five seconds and go directly to the 
video they want to watch. The advertiser is not charged unless the viewer watches the full 
ad or, for longer ads, for at least 30 seconds. TrueView ads, in effect, give advertisers five 
free seconds of branding, and also have a lower cost-per-click rate than Google’s search 
ads. As with many other types of online advertising, TrueView ads can be targeted based 
on audience demographics and other behavioral data. TrueView also allows advertisers to 
use what Google calls dynamic remarketing (another name for retargeting), which allows 
advertisers to show ads based on what users previously viewed on the advertiser’s website. 
TrueView ads encourage advertisers to deliver ads that people actually want to watch 
and engage with, and are attractive to advertisers because when viewers actively decide 
to watch, they are believed to have a greater level of interest. TrueView ads have been a 
rousing success, representing more than 85% of all of the in-stream ads on YouTube, and 
used by all of the top 100 global brands. 
Over the last two years, Google has taken a number of steps to enhance the effective-
ness of TrueView ads for advertisers. In April 2015, it added the ability to include an 
interactive card that overlays extra information, such as a list of related videos or playlists 
from the advertiser, or links to the advertiser’s website, on top of the video (typically in 
a scrollable vertical section that takes up about 35% of the video player screen). The 
card is not visible (and advertisers are not charged) unless a viewer clicks a button in the 
top-right corner of the video. TrueView cards work on mobile devices as well as desktops, 
and eventually will also be available on Internet-connected TVs.

In May 2015, Google announced a beta trial of TrueView for Shopping, which is built 
on the TrueView cards platform. Advertisers can now include images, product offers with 
prices, and the ability to click through to a brand’s products, allowing viewers to easily 
purchase items directly from the advertiser’s website. Two advertisers that participated in 
an early trial were online furniture retailer Wayfair and beauty products retailer Sephora. 
Wayfair created product-specific videos with tips for decorating, and included product 
prices, while Sephora created a series of how-to videos, tutorials, and curated product 
recommendations. Using an attribution system that it developed that allowed it to directly 
tie revenue back to specific customers exposed to a TrueView ad, Wayfair reported that 
the ads generated three times as much revenue compared to its traditional video ads. 
Sephora reported that its ads delivered a 54% lift in ad recall and an 80% lift in brand 
consideration, with an average view time of two minutes. In November 2015, Google 
released TrueView for Shopping to all advertisers in AdWords.
In July 2015, Google introduced 360-degree view for TrueView ads, which allows 
viewers to watch the video from different angles, such as from different parts of the 
interior of a car. On a desktop, users use a mouse; on a mobile device, just changing the 
orientation of the device delivers a different view. Budweiser is one advertiser that has 
already developed TrueView ads using this format, using them for its Bud Light brand to 
allow viewers to follow along a parade route and be in the middle of a dance floor of a 
1920s-themed party. 
In 2016, Google continued to tweak and expand the TrueView platform. In July, it 
added new features to its TrueView for Shopping format, including an interactive compan-
ion banner in a carousel format that lets viewers scroll through products as they watch a 
video. It also gave marketers access to full inventory across the YouTube app, making it the 
first time that TrueView ads can appear in the app’s mobile search results. In September 
2016, it introduced a new format for TrueView ads called TrueView for Action, which 
enables advertisers to place a clickable call-to-action banner at the bottom of the video 
while it plays and again at the end. According to Google, the number of advertisers using 
TrueView has increased by 50% between January and July 2016.
However, despite the success of the video ads in general, and the TrueView format in 
particular, video ads still have some hurdles to face. One of advertisers’ major concerns is 
the issue of viewability—whether video ads are actually seen. Currently, industry standards 
with respect to when a video ad is considered to be viewable are extremely low: just 50% 
of the ad’s pixels must be visible on screen for at least two consecutive seconds. Google 
research found that of video ads that did not meet this standard, about 75% were in a 
background tab or not on the screen at all, while the remainder were scrolled off-screen 
or actively abandoned in fewer than two seconds. In 2016, Google announced that its 
research found the average viewability of video ads across the Web was 66%, up from 
54% in 2015. In contrast, Google said that YouTube had an overall 93% (up 2%, from 
91% in 2015) video ad viewability rate.

erhaps no area of business has been more affected by Internet and mobile 
platform technologies than marketing and marketing communications. 
As a communications tool, the Internet affords marketers new ways of 
contacting millions of potential customers at costs far lower than traditional media. 
The Internet also provides new ways—often instantaneous and spontaneous—to gather 
information from customers, adjust product offerings, and increase customer value. 
The Internet has spawned entirely new ways to identify and communicate with cus-
tomers, including search engine marketing, social marketing, behavioral targeting, 
and targeted e-mail, among others. And the Internet was just the first transformation. 
Today, the mobile platform based on smartphones and tablet computers is transform-
ing online marketing and communications yet again. Table 6.1 summarizes some of 
the significant new developments in online marketing and advertising for 2016–2017.
The subject of online marketing, branding, and market communications is very 
broad and deep. We have created two chapters to cover the material. In this chapter, 
we begin by examining consumer behav­ior on the Web, the major types of online 
marketing and branding, and the technologies that support advances in online mar-
keting. We then focus on understanding the costs and benefits of online marketing 
communications. In Chapter 7, we focus on the social, mobile, and local marketing 
phenomenon in greater depth.

CONSUMERS ONLINE: THE INTERNET AUDIENCE AND 
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR
Before firms can begin to sell their products online, they must first understand what 
kinds of people they will find online and how those people behave in the online 
marketplace. In this section, we focus primarily on individual consumers in the 
business-to-consumer (B2C) arena. However, many of the factors discussed apply to 
the B2B arena as well, insofar as purchasing decisions by firms are made by individu-
als. We cover B2B marketing in more depth in Chapter 12. For readers who have no 
background in marketing, we have created an online Learning Track, Learning Track 
6.1, that discusses basic marketing and branding concepts.
INTERNET TRAFFIC PATTERNS: THE ONLINE CONSUMER PROFILE
We will start with an analysis of some basic background demographics of online con-
sumers in the United States. The first principle of marketing and sales is “know thy 
customer.” Who is online, who shops online and why, and what do they buy? In 2016, 
around 265 million people of all ages had access to the Internet. About 92 million 
households in the United States (over 75% of all households) have broadband access 
to the Internet. Worldwide, around 3.4 billion people are online.
Although the number of new online users increased at a rate of 30% a year or 
higher in the early 2000s, over the last several years, this growth rate has slowed to 
about 2% a year in the United States. E-commerce businesses can no longer count on

a double-digit growth rate in the online population to fuel their revenues. The days of 
extremely rapid growth in the U.S. Internet population are over.
Intensity and Scope of Usage
The slowing rate of growth in the U.S. Internet population is compensated for, in 
part, by an increasing intensity and scope of use. In 2016, more than 80% of the U.S. 
population regularly uses the Internet, spending a total of almost 5 hours and 45 
minutes a day (eMarketer, Inc., 2016a, 2016b). Internet use by teens is even more 
pervasive, with over 90% saying they go online daily, and about 25% reporting that 
they use the Internet almost constantly (Pew Research Center, 2015a). In 2016, mobile 
smartphones and tablets are major access points to the Internet and online commerce. 
About 210 million people, about 80% of all U.S. Internet users, access the Internet 
using a mobile phone. Owners of mobile devices spend over 3 hours a day using them 
for nontelephone activities such as playing games, viewing videos, and visiting social 
networks. Engaging in such activities is widespread—in 2016, around 180 million 
mobile users played games, about 140 million watched videos, over 160 million visited 
a social network, and millions of others listened to music or shopped (eMarketer, 
Inc., 2016a, 2016b). The more time users spend online, becoming more comfortable 
and familiar with Internet features and services, the more services they are likely to 
explore, according to the Pew Research Center.
B U S I N E S S
•	 Online marketing and advertising spending continues to increase (by over 20% in 2016), compared to 
only about 1% for traditional media marketing and advertising.
•	 Mobile advertising in all formats advertising continues to be one of the fastest growing types of digital 
advertising, and now is the platform for more than 60% of all digital advertising spending.
•	 Search engine marketing and advertising continues in importance, but its rate of growth is slowing 
somewhat compared to other formats.
•	 Social and local marketing spending all continue to rapidly expand.
•	 Viewability issues and ad fraud raise increasing concerns for marketers.
•	 Native advertising and other forms of content marketing rise.
T E C H N O L O G Y
•	 Ad blocking software usage increases, creating concern for both online publishers and advertisers.
•	 Big data: online tracking produces oceans of data, challenging business analytics programs.
•	 Cloud computing makes rich marketing content and multi-channel, cross-platform marketing a reality.
•	 Programmatic advertising (automated, technology-driven method of buying and selling display and 
video ads) takes off.
S O C I E T Y
•	 Targeted advertising based on behavioral tracking leads to growing privacy awareness and fears.

Demographics and Access
The demographic profile of the Internet—and e-commerce—has changed greatly since 
1995. Up until 2000, single, white, young, college-educated males with high incomes 
dominated the Internet. This inequality in access and usage led to concerns about a 
possible “digital divide.” However, in recent years, there has been a marked increase 
in Internet usage by females, minorities, seniors, and families with modest incomes, 
resulting in a notable decrease—but not elimination—in the earlier inequality of access 
and usage.
A roughly equal percentage of men (82%) and women (83%) use the Internet 
today. Teens (12–17) and young adults (18–24) form the age groups with the highest 
percentage of Internet use, at 97%. Adults in the 25–54 group are also strongly rep-
resented, with percentages of over 90%. Another fast-growing group online is the 65 
and over segment, 61% of whom now use the Internet. The percentage of very young 
children (0–11 years) online has also spurted, to 62% of that age group. Future Internet 
user growth in the United States will come predominantly from those aged 55 and 
older and from children in the 0–11 age bracket (eMarketer, Inc., 2016a). Variation 
across racial and ethnic groups is not as wide as across age groups. 
Ten years ago, there were significant differences among such groups in the United 
States, but this has receded. In 2016, 87% of whites use the Internet, compared to 
84% of blacks and Hispanics. About 97% of households with income levels above 
$75,000 use the Internet, compared to only 77% of households earning less than 
$30,000. Over time, income differences have declined but they remain significant 
with a 20% gap between the highest category of household income and the lowest. 
Amount of education also makes a significant difference when it comes to Internet 
usage. Of those individuals with less than a high school education, only 66% went 
online in 2016, compared to 97% of individuals with a college degree or more. Even 
some college education boosted Internet usage, with that segment reaching 94% (Pew 
Research Center, 2016).
Overall, the so-called “digital divide” has indeed moderated, but it still persists 
along income, education, age, and ethnic dimensions. Gender, income, education, 
age, and ethnicity also impact online behavior. According to the Pew Research Center, 
adults over the age of 65, those who have not completed high school, those who make 
less than $30,000 a year, and Hispanics are all less likely to purchase products online. 
Women are slightly more likely to purchase online than men, but not significantly so. 
With respect to online banking, the demographics are similar—those 65 and older are 
less likely than any age group to bank online, while those with at least some college 
are more likely than those with a high school diploma or less. Online banking is also 
more popular with men than women. No significant differences were found in terms 
of ethnicity (Pew Research Center, 2012). Other commentators have observed that 
children of poorer and less educated families spend considerably more time using 
their access devices for entertainment (movies, games, Facebook, and texting) than 
do children from wealthier households. For all children and teenagers, the majority 

	 C o n s u m e r s  O n l i n e :  T h e  I n t e r n e t  A u d i e n c e  a n d  C o n s u m e r  B e h a v i o r 	

341
of time spent on the Internet is often labeled as “wasted time” because the majority of 
online use is for entertainment, and not education or learning (Richtel, 2012).
Type of Internet Connection: Broadband and Mobile Impacts
While a great deal of progress has been made in reducing glaring gaps in access to the 
Internet, there are still inequalities in access to broadband service. In 2016, around 92 
million households had broadband service in their homes—over 75% of all households 
(eMarketer, Inc., 2016c). Research by the Pew Research Center indicates that broad-
band adoption levels are lower for older adults, those with low levels of education, and 
those with low household incomes. Rural residents, African Americans, and Latinos 
are also less likely to have a home broadband connection (Pew Research Center, 2013). 
For marketers, the broadband audience offers unique opportunities for the use of 
multimedia marketing campaigns, and for the positioning of products especially suited 
for this more educated and affluent audience. It is also important to note that just 
because a household does not have broadband access, it does not mean that household 
members do not use the Internet. About 50% of the non-broadband adopters do use 
the Internet, either from another location or via a smartphone. Certain groups are 
particularly reliant on smartphones for online access: younger adults in the 18–29 age 
group, those with low household incomes and levels of education, and non-whites 
(Pew Research Center, 2015b, 2013). The explosive growth of smartphones and tablet 
computers connected to broadband cellular and Wi-Fi networks is the foundation for a 
truly mobile e-commerce and marketing platform, which did not exist a few years ago. 
Community Effects: Social Contagion in Social Networks
For a physical retail store, the most important factor in shaping sales is location, loca-
tion, location. If you are located where thousands of people pass by every day, you will 
tend to do well. But for Internet retailers, physical location has almost no consequence 
as long as customers can be served by shipping services such as UPS or the post office 
or their services can be downloaded to anywhere. What does make a difference for 
consumer purchases on the Internet is whether or not the consumer is located in 
“neighborhoods” where others purchase on the Internet. These neighborhoods can 
be either face-to-face and truly personal, or digital. These so-called neighborhood 
effects, and the role of social emulation in consumption decisions, are well known for 
goods such as personal computers. In general, there is a relationship between being 
a member of a social network and purchasing decisions. Yet the relationship between 
“connectedness” (either offline or online) and purchase decisions is not straightforward 
or simple. People who score in the top 10%–15% of connectedness “do their own thing” 
to differentiate themselves and often do not share purchase decisions with friends. In 
fact, highly connected users often stop purchasing what their friends purchase. One 
can think of them as iconoclasts. The middle 50% of connected people very often 
share purchase patterns of their friends. One can think of these people as “keeping up 
with the Joneses” (Iyengar et al., 2009). A study of 6,000 social network users found

C H A P T E R  6     E - c o m m e r c e  M a r k e t i n g  a n d  A d v e r t i s i n g  C o n c e p t s
that social networks have a powerful influence on shopping and purchasing behavior. 
An estimated 40% of social media users have purchased an item after sharing or 
favoriting it on Facebook, Pinterest, or Twitter. Facebook is the network most likely to 
drive customers to purchase, followed by Pinterest and Twitter. Unexpectedly, social 
networks increase research online, followed by purchase offline (sometimes referred 
to as ROPO), driving purchase traffic into physical stores where the product can be 
seen, tried, and then purchased. This is the opposite of the showrooming effect where 
consumers shop in stores, and then purchase online. The ROPO effect was found to 
be as large as the research offline and purchase online effect (Vision Critical, 2013; 
Schleifer, 2013; Sevitt and Samuel, 2013).
Membership in social networks has a large influence on discovering new indepen-
dent music, but less influence on already well-known products (Garg, 2009). Member-
ship in an online brand community like Ford’s Facebook page and community has a 
direct effect on sales (Adjei et al., 2009). Amazon’s recommender systems (“Consumers 
who bought this item also bought ...”) create co-purchase networks where people do 
not know one another personally, but nevertheless triple the influence of comple-
mentary products (Oestreicher-Singer and Sundararajan, 2008). The value of social 
networks to marketers rests on the proposition that brand strength and purchase 
decisions are closely related to network membership, rank, prominence, and centrality 
(Guo et al., 2011).
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR MODELS
Once firms have an understanding of who is online, they need to focus on how con-
sumers behave online. The study of consumer behavior is a social science discipline 
that attempts to model and understand the behavior of humans in a marketplace. 
Several social science disciplines play roles in this study, including sociology, psychol-
ogy, and economics. Models of consumer behavior attempt to predict or “explain” what 
consumers purchase and where, when, how much, and why they buy. The expectation 
is that if the consumer decision-making process can be understood, firms will have a 
much better idea how to market and sell their products. Figure 6.1 illustrates a 
general consumer behavior model that takes into account a wide range of factors that 
influence a consumer’s marketplace decisions. Learning Track 6.2 contains further 
information about the cultural, social, and psychological background factors that influ-
ence consumer behavior.
PROFILES OF ONLINE CONSUMERS
Online consumer behavior parallels that of offline consumer behavior with some 
obvious differences. It is important to first understand why people choose the Internet 
channel to conduct transactions. Table 6.2 lists the main reasons consumers choose 
the online channel.
While price is an important consideration, consumers also shop online because 
of convenience, which in turn is produced largely by saving them time. Overall 
transaction cost reduction appears to be a major motivator for choosing the online 
channel.

THE ONLINE PURCHASING DECISION
Once online, why do consumers actually purchase a product or service at a specific 
site? Among the most important reasons are price and the availability of free shipping. 
That the seller is someone whom the purchaser trusts is also a very important factor.

The ability to make a purchase without paying tax and the availability of an online 
coupon are also significant factors.
You also need to consider the process that buyers follow when making a purchase 
decision, and how the Internet environment affects consumers’ decisions. There are 
five stages in the consumer decision process: awareness of need, search for more infor-
mation, evaluation of alternatives, the actual purchase decision, and post-purchase 
contact with the firm. Figure 6.2 shows the consumer decision process and the types 
of offline and online marketing communications that support this process and seek to 
influence the consumer before, during, and after the purchase decision.
The stages of the consumer decision process are basically the same whether the 
consumer is offline or online. On the other hand, the general model of consumer 
behavior requires modification to take into account new factors, and the unique fea-
tures of e-commerce that allow new opportunities to interact with the customer online 
also need to be accounted for. In Figure 6.3, we have modified the general model 
of consumer behavior to focus on user characteristics, product characteristics, and 
website and mobile platform features, along with traditional factors such as brand 
strength and specific market communications (advertising) and the influence of both 
online and offline social networks. 
In the online model, website and mobile platform features, along with consumer 
skills, product characteristics, attitudes towards online purchasing, and perceptions

about control over the online environment come to the fore. Website and mobile 
platform features include latency (delay in downloads), navigability, and confidence 
in online security. There are parallels in the analog world. For instance, it is well 
known that consumer behavior can be influenced by store design, and that under-
standing the precise movements of consumers through a physical store can enhance 
sales if goods and promotions are arranged along the most likely consumer tracks. 
Consumer skills refers to the knowledge that consumers have about how to conduct 
online transactions (which increases with experience). Product characteristics refers 
to the fact that some products can be easily described, packaged, and shipped online, 
whereas others cannot. Combined with traditional factors, such as brand, advertising, 
and firm capabilities, these factors lead to specific attitudes about purchasing from an 
e-commerce firm (trust in the firm and favorable customer experience) and a sense 
that the consumer can control his or her environment online.
Clickstream behavior refers to the transaction log that consumers establish as 
they move about the Web, from search engine to a variety of sites, then to a single site, 
then to a single page, and then, finally, to a decision to purchase. These precious 
moments are similar to “point-of-purchase” moments in traditional retail. A study of 
over 10,000 visits to an online wine store found that detailed and general clickstream

consumers establish as

FIGURE 6.3	
A MODEL OF ONLINE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR
In this general model of online consumer behavior, the decision to purchase is shaped by background 
demographic factors, several intervening factors, and, finally, influenced greatly by clickstream behavior very 
near to the precise moment of purchase.

behavior were as important as customer demographics and prior purchase behavior 
in predicting a current purchase (Van den Poel and Buckinx, 2005). Clickstream mar-
keting takes maximum advantage of the Internet environment. It presupposes no prior 
“deep” knowledge of the customer (and in that sense is “privacy-regarding”), and can 
be developed dynamically as customers use the Internet. For instance, the success of 
search engine marketing (the display of paid advertisements by search engines) is 
based in large part on what the consumer is looking for at the moment and how they 
go about looking (detailed clickstream data). After examining the detailed data, general 
clickstream data is used (days since last visit, past purchases). If available, demo-
graphic data is used (region, city, and gender).
SHOPPERS: BROWSERS AND BUYERS
The picture of Internet use sketched in the previous section emphasizes the complex-
ity of behavior online. Although the Internet audience still tends to be concentrated 
among the well educated, affluent, and youthful, the audience is increasingly becom-
ing more diverse. Clickstream analysis shows us that people go online for many dif-
ferent reasons. Online shopping is similarly complex. Beneath the surface of the $600 
billion B2C e-commerce market in 2016 are substantial differences in how users shop 
online.
For instance, as shown in Figure 6.4, 77% of U.S. Internet users, age 14 and 
older, are “buyers” who actually purchase something online. Another 13.8% research 
products online (“browsers”), but purchase them offline. With the teen and adult U.S. 
Internet audience (14 years or older) estimated at about 229 million in 2016, online 
shoppers (the combination of buyers and browsers, totalling almost 90%) add up to a 
market size of over 208 million consumers. Most marketers find this number exciting.
The significance of online browsing for offline purchasing should not be under-
estimated. Although it is difficult to precisely measure the amount of offline sales 
that occur because of online product research, Forrester Research estimates that

web-influenced retail sales will generate about $1.3 trillion in 2016, growing to around 
$1.6 trillion by 2020 (Forrester Research, 2016). 
E-commerce is a major conduit and generator of offline commerce. The reverse 
is also true: online traffic is driven by offline brands and shopping. While online 
research influences offline purchases, it is also the case that offline marketing media 
heavily influence online behavior including sales. Traditional print media (magazines 
and newspapers) and television are by far the most powerful media for reaching and 
engaging consumers with information about new products and directing them to the 
Web. Online communities and blogging are also very influential but not yet as power-
ful as traditional media. This may be surprising to many given the attention to social 
networks as marketing vehicles, but it reflects the diversity of influences on consumer 
behavior and the real-world marketing budgets of firms that are still heavily dominated 
by traditional media. Even more surprising in the era of Facebook, face-to-face interac-
tions are a more powerful influence than participation in online social communities.
These considerations strongly suggest that e-commerce and traditional com-
merce are coupled and should be viewed by merchants (and researchers) as part of 
a continuum of consuming behavior and not as radical alternatives to one another. 
Commerce is commerce; the customers are often the same people. Customers use a 
wide variety of media, sometimes multiple media at once. The significance of these 
findings for marketers is very clear. Online merchants should build the information 
content of their sites to attract browsers looking for information, build content to rank 
high in search engines, put less attention on selling per se, and promote services and 
products (especially new products) in offline media settings in order to support their 
online stores.
WHAT CONSUMERS SHOP FOR AND BUY ONLINE
You can look at online sales as divided roughly into two groups: small-ticket and 
big-ticket items. Big-ticket items include computer equipment and consumer elec-
tronics, where orders can easily be more than $1,000. Small-ticket items include 
apparel, books, health and beauty supplies, office supplies, music, software, videos, 
and toys, where the average purchase is typically less than $100. In the early days 
of e-commerce, sales of small-ticket items vastly outnumbered those of large-ticket 
items. But the recent growth of big-ticket items such as computer hardware, consumer 
electronics, furniture, and jewelry has changed the overall sales mix. Consumers are 
now much more confident spending online for big-ticket items. Although furniture and 
large appliances were initially perceived as too bulky to sell online, these categories 
have rapidly expanded in the last few years. Free shipping offered by Amazon and 
other large retailers has also contributed to consumers buying many more expensive 
and large items online such as air conditioners. Refer to Figure 9.2 to see how much 
consumers spent online for various categories of goods in 2015.
INTENTIONAL ACTS: HOW SHOPPERS FIND VENDORS ONLINE
Given the prevalence of “click here” display ads, one might think customers are 
“driven” to online vendors by spur-of-the-moment decisions. In fact, only a tiny

C H A P T E R  6     E - c o m m e r c e  M a r k e t i n g  a n d  A d v e r t i s i n g  C o n c e p t s
percentage of shoppers click on display ads to find vendors. E-commerce shoppers are 
highly intentional. Typically, they are focused browsers looking for specific products, 
companies, and services. Once they are online, a majority of consumers use a search 
engine as their preferred method of research for purchasing a product. Many will go 
directly to a online marketplace, such as Amazon or eBay, and some will go directly 
to a specific retail website. Merchants can convert these “goal-oriented,” intentional 
shoppers into buyers if the merchants can target their communications to the shoppers 
and design their sites in such a way as to provide easy-to-access and useful product 
information, full selection, and customer service, and do this at the very moment the 
customer is searching for the product. This is no small task.
WHY SOME PEOPLE DON’T SHOP ONLINE
About 9% of Internet users do not shop or buy online. Why not? One of the most 
important factors cited by those who don’t shop or buy online is the “trust factor,” the 
fear that online merchants will cheat you, lose your credit card information, or use 
personal information you give them to invade your personal privacy, bombarding 
you with unwanted e-mail and pop-up ads. Secondary factors can be summarized 
as “hassle factors,” like shipping costs, returns, and inability to touch and feel the 
product.
TRUST, UTILITY, AND OPPORTUNISM IN ONLINE MARKETS
A long tradition of research shows that the two most important factors shaping the 
decision to purchase online are utility and trust (Brookings Institute, 2011; Kim et 
al., 2009; Ba and Pavlou, 2002). Consumers want good deals, bargains, convenience, 
and speed of delivery. In short, consumers are looking for utility. On the other 
hand, in any seller-buyer relationship, there is an asymmetry of information. The 
seller usually knows a lot more than the consumer about the quality of goods and 
terms of sale. This can lead to opportunistic behavior by sellers (Akerlof, 1970; Wil-
liamson, 1985; Mishra, 1998). Consumers need to trust a merchant before they make 
a purchase. Sellers can develop trust among online consumers by building strong 
reputations of honesty, fairness, and delivery of quality products—the basic elements 
of a brand. Feedback forums such as Epinions.com (now part of Shopping.com), 
Amazon’s book reviews from reviewers, and eBay’s feedback forum are examples of 
trust-building online mechanisms (NielsenWire, 2012; Opinion Research Corpora-
tion, 2009). Online sellers who develop trust among consumers are able to charge a 
premium price for their online products and services (Kim and Benbasat, 2006, 2007; 
Pavlou, 2002). A review of the literature suggests that the most important factors 
leading to a trusting online relationship are perception of website credibility, ease 
of use, and perceived risk (Corritore et al., 2006). An important brake on the growth 
of e-commerce is lack of trust. Newspaper and television ads are far more trusted 
than online ads (Nielsen, 2011). Personal friends and family are far more powerful 
determinants of online purchases than membership in social networks (eMarketer, 
Inc., 2010). These attitudes have grown more positive over time, but concerns about 
the use of personal information by online marketers continue to raise trust issues 
among consumers.

	 6.2 	 DIGITAL COMMERCE MARKETING AND ADVERTISING 
STRATEGIES AND TOOLS 
Online marketing has many similarities to, and differences from, ordinary marketing. 
(For more information on basic marketing concepts, see Learning Tracks 6.1 and 6.2.) 
The objective of online marketing—as in all marketing—is to build customer relation-
ships so that the firm can achieve above-average returns (both by offering superior 
products or services and by communicating the brand’s features to the consumer). 
These relationships are a foundation for the firm’s brand. But online marketing is 
also very different from ordinary marketing because the nature of the medium and 
its capabilities are so different from anything that has come before. 
There are four features of online marketing that distinguish it from traditional 
marketing channels. Compared to traditional print and television marketing, online 
marketing can be more personalized, participatory, peer-to-peer, and communal. Not 
all types of online marketing have these four features. For instance, there’s not much 
difference between a marketing video splashed on your computer screen without 
your consent and watching a television commercial. However, the same marketing 
video can be targeted to your personal interests, community memberships, and allow 
you to share it with others using a Like or + tag. Marketers are learning that the most 
effective forms of online marketing have all four of these features. 
STRATEGIC ISSUES AND QUESTIONS 
In the past, the first step in building an online brand was to build a website, and then 
try to attract an audience. The most common “traditional” marketing techniques for 
establishing a brand and attracting customers were search engine marketing, display 
ads, e-mail campaigns, and affiliate programs. This is still the case: building a website 
is still a first step, and the “traditional” online marketing techniques are still the main 
powerhouses of brand creation and online sales revenue. But today, marketers need 
to take a much broader view of the online marketing challenge, and to consider other 
media channels for attracting an audience such as social media and mobile devices, 
in concert with traditional websites. 
The five main elements of a comprehensive multi-channel marketing plan are: 
website, traditional online marketing, social marketing, mobile marketing, and offline 
marketing. Table 6.3 illustrates these five main platforms, central elements within 
each type, some examples, and the primary function of marketing in each situation. 
Each of the main types of online marketing is discussed in this section and throughout 
the chapter in greater detail. 
Immediately, by examining Table 6.3, you can understand the management 
complexity of building brands online. There are five major types of marketing, and 
a variety of different platforms that perform different functions. If you’re a manager 
of a startup, or the website manager of an existing commercial website, you face a 
number of strategic questions. Where should you focus first? Build a website, develop 
a blog, or jump into developing a Facebook presence? If you have a successful website 
that already uses search engine marketing and display ads, where should you go next:

develop a social network presence or use offline media? Does your firm have the 
resources to maintain a social media marketing campaign? 
A second strategic management issue involves the integration of all these differ-
ent marketing platforms into a single coherent branding message. Often, there are 
different groups with different skill sets involved in website design, search engine and 
display marketing, social media marketing, and offline marketing. Getting all these 
different specialties to work together and coordinate their campaigns can be very 
difficult. The danger is that a firm ends up with different teams managing each of the 
four platforms rather than a single team managing the digital online presence, or for 
that matter, marketing for the entire firm including retail outlets.

A third strategic management question involves resource allocation. There are 
actually two problems here. Each of the different major types of marketing, and each 
of the different platforms, has different metrics to measure its effectiveness. In some 
cases, for new social marketing platforms, there is no commonly accepted metric, 
and few that have withstood critical scrutiny or have a deep experience base provid-
ing empirical data. For instance, in Facebook marketing, an important metric is how 
many Likes your Facebook page produces. The connection between Likes and sales 
is still being explored. In search engine marketing, effectiveness is measured by how 
many clicks your ads are receiving; in display advertising, by how many impressions 
of your ads are served. Second, each of these platforms has different costs for Likes, 
impressions, and clicks. In order to choose where your marketing resources should 
be deployed, you will have to link each of these activities to sales revenue. You will 
need to determine how much clicks, Likes, and impressions are worth. We address 
these questions in greater detail in Chapter 7. 
THE WEBSITE AS A MARKETING PLATFORM: ESTABLISHING THE 
CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP 
A firm’s website is a major tool for establishing the initial relationship with the cus-
tomer. The website performs four important functions: establishing the brand identity 
and consumer expectations, informing and educating the consumer, shaping the cus-
tomer experience, and anchoring the brand in an ocean of marketing messages coming 
from different sources. The website is the one place the consumer can turn to find the 
complete story. This is not true of apps, e-mail, or search engine ads. 
The first function of a website is to establish the brand’s identity and to act as an 
anchor for the firm’s other web marketing activities, thereby driving sales revenue. 
This involves identifying for the consumer the differentiating features of the product 
or service in terms of quality, price, product support, and reliability. Identifying the 
differentiating features of the product on the website’s home page is intended to create 
expectations in the user of what it will be like to consume the product. For instance, 
Snapple’s website creates the expectation that the product is a delicious, refreshing 
drink made from high quality, natural ingredients. Ford’s website focuses on automo-
bile technology and high miles per gallon. The expectation created by Ford’s website 
is that if you buy a Ford, you’ll be experiencing the latest automotive technology and 
the highest mileage. At the location-based social network website for Foursquare, the 
focus is on meeting friends, discovering local places, and saving money with coupons 
and rewards. 
Websites also function to anchor the brand online, acting as a central point where 
all the branding messages that emanate from the firm’s multiple digital presences, 
such as Facebook, Twitter, mobile apps, or e-mail, come together at a single online 
location. Aside from branding, websites also perform the typical functions of any 
commercial establishment by informing customers of the company’s products and 
services. Websites, with their online catalogs and associated shopping carts, are impor-
tant elements of the online customer experience. Customer experience refers to the 
totality of experiences that a customer has with a firm, including the search, informing, 
purchase, consumption, and after-sales support for the product. The concept “customer 
customer experience 
the totality of experiences 
that a customer has with a 
firm, including the search, 
informing, purchase, 
consumption, and after-
sales support for its prod-
ucts, services, and various 
retail channels

experience” is broader than the traditional concept of “customer satisfaction” in that 
a much broader range of impacts is considered, including the customer’s cognitive, 
affective, emotional, social, and physical relationship to the firm and its products. The 
totality of customer experiences will generally involve multiple retail channels. This 
means that, in the customer’s mind, the website, mobile site and apps, Facebook page, 
Twitter feed, physical store, and television advertisements are all connected as part 
of his or her experience with the company.
TRADITIONAL ONLINE MARKETING AND ADVERTISING TOOLS 
Below we describe the basic marketing and advertising tools for attracting e-commerce 
consumers: search engine marketing, display ad marketing (including banner ads, rich 
media ads, video ads, and sponsorships), e-mail and permission marketing, affiliate 
marketing, viral marketing, and lead generation marketing.
Companies will spend an estimated $195 billion on advertising in 2016, and an 
estimated $72 billion of that amount on online advertising, which includes display 
(banners, video, and rich media), search, mobile messaging, sponsorships, classifieds, 
lead generation, and e-mail, on desktop and laptop computers, as well as mobile 
devices (see Figure 6.5) (eMarketer, Inc., 2016e).

In the last five years, advertisers have aggressively increased online spending and 
cut outlays on traditional channels. By 2018, the amount spent on online advertising 
is expected to exceed the amount spent on television advertising. 
Table 6.4 provides some comparative data on the amount of spending for certain 
advertising formats. In 2016, the highest amount of spending is for paid search, fol-
lowed by banner ads, but the fastest growing online ad formats are rich media and 
video ads. 
Spending on online advertising among different industries is somewhat skewed. 
Retail accounts for the highest percentage (22%), followed by financial services (13%), 
automotive (13%), telecommunications (9%), leisure travel (9%), consumer electronics 
and computers (7%), consumer packaged goods (6%), pharmaceuticals and healthcare 
(5%), media (5%), and entertainment (4%) (Interactive Advertising Bureau/Pricewa-
terhouseCoopers, 2016). Online advertising has both advantages and disadvantages 
when compared to advertising in traditional media, such as television, radio, and print 
(magazines and newspapers). One big advantage for online advertising is that the 
Internet is where the audience has moved, especially the very desirable 18–34 age 
group. A second big advantage for online advertising is the ability to target ads to 
individuals and small groups and to track performance of advertisements in almost 
real time. Ad targeting, the sending of market messages to specific subgroups in the 
population in an effort to increase the likelihood of a purchase, is as old as advertising 
itself, but prior to the Internet, it could only be done with much less precision, cer-
tainly not down to the level of individuals. Ad targeting is also the foundation of price 
discrimination: the ability to charge different types of consumers different prices for 
the same product or service. With online advertising, it’s theoretically possible to 
charge every customer a different price.

Theoretically, online advertising can personalize every ad message to precisely 
fit the needs, interests, and values of each consumer. In practice, as we all know 
from spam and constant exposure to ads that are of little interest, the reality is very 
different. Online advertisements also provide greater opportunities for interactivity—
two-way communication between advertisers and potential customers. The primary 
disadvantages of online advertising are concerns about its cost versus its benefits, 
how to adequately measure its results, and the supply of good venues to display ads. 
For instance, the owners of websites who sell advertising space (“publishers”) do not 
have agreed-upon standards or routine audits to verify their claimed numbers as do 
traditional media outlets. We examine the costs and benefits of online advertising as 
well as research on its effectiveness in Section 6.4.
Search Engine Marketing and Advertising
In 2016, companies will spend an estimated $33 billion on search engine marketing 
and advertising, about 46% of all spending for digital marketing. Around 225 million 
U.S. Internet users (almost 85% of all U.S. Internet users) use a search engine at least 
once a month (eMarketer, Inc., 2016a). Briefly, this is where the eyeballs are (at least 
for a few moments) and this is where advertising can be very effective by responding 
with ads that match the interests and intentions of the user. The click-through rate for 
search engine advertising is generally 1%–4% (with an average of around 2%) and has 
been fairly steady over the years. The top three search engine providers (Google, 
Microsoft/Bing, and Yahoo) supply more than 95% of all online searches. Search 
engine marketing (SEM) refers to the use of search engines to build and sustain 
brands. Search engine advertising refers to the use of search engines to support 
direct sales to online consumers. 
Search engines are often thought of as mostly direct sales channels focused 
on making sales in response to advertisements. While this is a major use of search 
engines, they are also used more subtly to strengthen brand awareness, drive traffic to 
other websites or blogs to support customer engagement, to gain deeper insight into 
customers’ perceptions of the brand, to support other related advertising (for instance, 
sending consumers to local dealer sites), and to support the brand indirectly. Search 
engines can also provide marketers insight into customer search patterns, opinions 
customers hold about their products, top trending search keywords, and what their 
competitors are using as keywords and the customer response. For example, PepsiCo, 
home of mega brands like Pepsi and Doritos, makes no sales on the Web, but has 
several branding websites aimed at consumers, investors, and shareholders. The focus 
is on building, sustaining, and updating the Pepsi collection of branded consumer 
goods. A search on Pepsi will generate numerous search results that link to Pepsi 
marketing materials. 
Types of Search Engine Advertising  Search engine sites originally performed unbiased 
searches of the Web’s huge collection of web pages and derived most of their revenue 
from banner advertisements. This form of search engine results is often called organic 
search because the inclusion and ranking of websites depends on a more or less 
“unbiased” application of a set of rules (an algorithm) imposed by the search engine.

Since 1998, search engine sites slowly transformed themselves into digital yellow 
pages, where firms pay for inclusion in the search engine index, pay for keywords to 
show up in search results, or pay for keywords to show up in other vendors’ ads.
Most search engines offer paid inclusion programs, which, for a fee, guarantee 
a website’s inclusion in its list of search results, more frequent visits by its web crawler, 
and suggestions for improving the results of organic searching. Search engines claim 
that these payments—costing some merchants hundreds of thousands a year—do not 
influence the organic ranking of a website in search results, just inclusion in the 
results. However, it is the case that page inclusion ads get more hits, and the rank of 
the page appreciates, causing the organic search algorithm to rank it higher in the 
organic results.
Google claims that it does not permit firms to pay for their rank in the organic 
results, although it does allocate two to three sponsored links at the very top of their 
pages, albeit labeling them as “Sponsored Links.” Merchants who refuse to pay for 
inclusion or for keywords typically fall far down on the list of results, and off the first 
page of results, which is akin to commercial death.
Pay-per-click (PPC) search ads are the primary type of search engine advertis-
ing. In keyword advertising, merchants purchase keywords through a bidding process 
at search sites, and whenever a consumer searches for that word, their advertisement 
shows up somewhere on the page, usually as a small text-based advertisement on the 
right, but also as a listing on the very top of the page. The more merchants pay, the 
higher the rank and greater the visibility of their ads on the page. Generally, the search 
engines do not exercise editorial judgment about quality or content of the ads although 
they do monitor the use of language. In addition, some search engines rank the ads 
in terms of their popularity rather than merely the money paid by the advertiser so 
that the rank of the ad depends on both the amount paid and the number of clicks per 
unit time. Google’s keyword advertising program is called AdWords.
Network keyword advertising (context advertising), introduced by Google as 
its AdSense product in 2002, differs from the ordinary keyword advertising described 
previously. Publishers (websites that want to show ads) join these networks and allow 
the search engine to place “relevant” ads on their sites. The ads are paid for by advertis-
ers who want their messages to appear across the Web. Google-like text messages are 
the most common. The revenue from the resulting clicks is split between the search 
engine and the site publisher, although the publisher gets much more than half in 
some cases. 
Search engine advertising is nearly an ideal targeted marketing technique: at 
precisely the moment that a consumer is looking for a product, an advertisement for 
that product is presented. Consumers benefit from search engine advertising because 
ads for merchants appear only when consumers are looking for a specific product. 
Thus, search engine advertising saves consumers cognitive energy and reduces search 
costs (including the cost of transportation needed to do physical searches for products). 
Because search engine marketing can be very effective, companies optimize their 
websites for search engine recognition. The better optimized the page is, the higher 
a ranking it will achieve in search engine result listings, and the more likely it will 
appear on the top of the page in search engine results. Search engine optimization

(SEO) is the process of improving the ranking of web pages with search engines by 
altering the content and design of the web pages and site. By carefully selecting key 
words used on the web pages, updating content frequently, and designing the site so 
it can be easily read by search engine programs, marketers can improve the impact 
and return on investment in their web marketing programs.
Google and other search engine firms make frequent changes to their search 
algorithms in order to improve the search results and user experience. Google, for 
instance, reportedly makes over 600 search engine changes in a year. Most are small 
unannounced tweaks. Recent major changes have included Panda, Penguin, Hum-
mingbird, Knowledge Graph, and an unnamed algorithm that has been nicknamed 
Mobilegeddon. Panda was introduced in 2011 in an effort to weed out low quality sites 
from search results. Those sites with thin content, duplicate content, content copied 
from elsewhere on the Web, and content that did not attract high-quality hits from 
other sources were systematically pushed down in the search results. Google intro-
duced Penguin in 2012 in an effort to punish websites and their SEO marketing firms 
who were manipulating links to their site in order to improve their rankings. The 
Google search engine rewards sites that have links from many other sites. What some 
marketers discovered is that Google could not tell the quality of these back links, and 
they began to manufacture links by putting their clients onto list sites, creating mul-
tiple blogs to link to their clients’ sites, and paying others to link to their clients’ sites. 
Penguin evaluates the quality of links to a site, and pushes down in the rankings those 
sites that have poor-quality back links. Between 2012 and 2016, Google released four 
major Penguin updates and in September 2016 that it had become part of the core 
Google algorithm.
Many search engines are attempting to capture more of what the user intended, 
or might like to know about a search subject. This is often referred to as semantic 
search. Google introduced Hummingbird in 2013. Rather than evaluate each word 
separately in a search, Google’s semantically informed Hummingbird will try to evalu-
ate an entire sentence. Semantic search more closely follows conversational search, 
or search as you would ordinarily speak it to another human being. 
Google introduced Knowledge Graph in 2012 as an effort to anticipate what you 
might want to know more about as you search on a topic or answer questions you might 
not thought of asking. Since 2013, results of Knowledge Graph appear on the right of 
the screen and contain more information about the topic or person you are searching 
on. Not all search terms have a Knowledge Graph result. Google displays information 
based on what other users have searched for in the past, as well as its database on over 
1 billion objects (people, places, and things), and more than 18 billion facts. 
In 2015, Google released a new algorithm update (nicknamed Mobilegeddon) that 
made the “mobile-friendliness” of websites a much stronger ranking factor for mobile 
searches. Websites that are not optimized for mobile now have a much lower ranking 
in mobile search results. And starting in November 2015, Google began lowering the 
search rank of mobile websites that display an ad that obscures the screen and asks 
users whether they would like to install the site’s mobile app, on the grounds that such 
ads are less mobile-friendly. Companies that use such ads, such as Yelp, LinkedIn, 
Pinterest, and others, have charged that Google’s new policy is in part an effort to 
protect its web search revenue from mobile apps that lure users away from the Web.

Social Search  Social search is an attempt to use your social contacts (and your 
entire social graph) to provide search results. In contrast to search engines that use 
a mathematical algorithm to find pages that satisfy your query, social search reviews 
your friends’ (and their friends’) recommendations, past web visits, and use of Like 
buttons. One problem with traditional search engines is that they are so thorough: 
enter a search for “smartphone” on Google and in .28 seconds you will receive 569 
million results, some of which provide helpful information and others that are 
suspect. Social search is an effort to provide fewer, more relevant, and trustworthy 
results based on the social graph. Facebook’s first effort to create a social search 
engine was Facebook Graph Search, which it launched in 2013. Graph Search pro-
duced information from within a user’s network of friends supplemented with addi-
tional results provided by Bing. In 2014, Facebook introduced a series of changes to 
Graph Search, dropping its relationship with Bing, rebranding the product as Face-
book Search, and providing keyword search functionality that enables users to find 
people, photos, posts, videos, and links on Facebook by searching for words within 
a post. Results are ranked using a personalization algorithm based in part on the 
user’s relationship to the poster.
Search Engine Issues  While search engines have provided significant benefits to mer-
chants and customers, they also present risks and costs. For instance, search engines 
have the power to crush a small business by placing its ads on the back pages of search 
results. Merchants are at the mercy of search engines for access to the online market-
place, and this access is dominated by a single firm, Google. How Google decides to 
rank one company over another in search results is not known. No one really knows 
how to improve in its rankings (although there are hundreds of firms who claim 
otherwise). Google editors intervene in unknown ways to punish certain websites and 
reward others. Using paid sponsored listings, as opposed to relying on organic search 
results, eliminates some, but not all, of this uncertainty. 
Other practices that degrade the results and usefulness of search engines include:
•	 Link farms are groups of websites that link to one another, thereby boosting their 
ranking in search engines that use a PageRank algorithm to judge the “usefulness” 
of a site. For instance, in the 2010 holiday season, JCPenney was found to be the 
highest ranked merchant for a large number of clothing products. On examination, 
it was discovered that this resulted from Penney’s hiring a search engine optimiza-
tion company to create thousands of websites that linked to JCPenney’s website. 
As a result, JCPenney’s website became the most popular (most linked-to) website 
for products like dresses, shirts, and pants. No matter what popular clothing item 
people searched for, JCPenney came out on top. Experts believe this was the largest 
search engine fraud in history. Google’s Panda series of updates to its search algo-
rithms were aimed in part at eliminating link farms (Castell, 2014).
•	 Content farms are companies that generate large volumes of textual content for 
multiple websites designed to attract viewers and search engines. Content farms 
profit by attracting large numbers of readers to their sites and exposing them to ads. 
The content typically is not original but is artfully copied or summarized from 
legitimate content sites.

•	 Click fraud occurs when a competitor clicks on search engine results and ads, forcing 
the advertiser to pay for the click even though the click is not legitimate. Competitors 
can hire offshore firms to perform fraudulent clicks or hire botnets to automate the 
process. Click fraud can quickly run up a large bill for merchants, and not result in 
any growth in sales. A study by the National Association of Advertisers estimated that 
advertisers would lose $7.2 billion in 2016 due to click fraud (Ragan, 2016).
Display Ad Marketing
In 2016, companies will spend around $35 billion on all forms of display ad marketing, 
about 48% of all spending for digital marketing. More than 6 trillion display ads will 
be served on desktop and mobile devices in 2016. The top five display ad companies 
are Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yahoo, and Verizon (AOL and Millennial Media), which 
together account for almost 60% of U.S. display ad revenue. The Interactive Adver-
tising Bureau (IAB), an industry organization, has established voluntary industry 
guidelines for display ads. Publishers are not required to use these guidelines, but 
many do. One objective of IAB is to give the consumer a consistent experience across 
all websites. The various types of ads are designed to help advertisers break through 
the “noise” and clutter created by the high number of display ad impressions that a 
typical user is exposed to within a given day. Figure 6.6 shows examples of the seven 
core standard ad units, as specified by the IAB. According to Google, the top performing 
ad formats are the large rectangle, the medium rectangle, the leaderboard, and the 
half-page (Google Inc., 2016). Display ads consist of four different kinds of ads: banner 
ads, rich media ads (animated ads), sponsorships, and video ads.
Banner Ads  Banner ads are the oldest and most familiar form of display marketing. 
They are also the least effective and the lowest cost form of online marketing. A 
banner ad displays a promotional message in a rectangular box on the screen of a 
desktop computer or mobile device. A banner ad is similar to a traditional ad in a 
printed publication but has some added advantages. When clicked, it brings potential 
customers directly to the advertiser’s website, and the site where the ad appears can 
observe the user’s behavior on the site. The ability to identify and track the user is a 
key feature of online advertising. Banner ads often feature video and other animations. 
It’s important to note that, although the terms banner ad and display ad are often used 
interchangeably, banner ads are just one form of display ad. Despite their limited 
effectiveness, advertisers will still spend about $14 billion on banner ads in 2016, about 
42% of all spending on display ads, and 20% of total online ad spending.
Rich Media Ads  Ads that employ animation, sound, and interactivity, using Flash, 
HTML5, Java, and JavaScript are referred to as rich media ads. Rich media ads are 
expected to account for about $8 billion in online advertising expenditures (about 11% 
of total online advertising but one of the fastest growing formats) in 2016. They are 
far more effective than simple banner ads. For instance, one research report that 
analyzed 24,000 different rich media ads with more than 12 billion impressions served 
in North America over a six-month period found that exposure to rich media ads 
boosted advertiser site visits by nearly 300% compared to standard banner ads. Viewers

of rich media ads that included video were six times more likely to visit the advertiser’s 
website, by either directly clicking on the ad, typing the advertiser’s URL, or searching 
(MediaMind, 2012a). Recent research by the IAB indicates that its Rising Star ad units 
that can incorporate rich media elements deliver a 30% stronger brand lift than the 
traditional IAB core display ads with just one full exposure, increasing to over 40% 
when a consumer interacts with the ad. Rising Star ads also topped traditional display 
ads in terms of ad recall and were considered less annoying (IAB, 2015).
The IAB provides guidance for a number of different types of rich media ads, such 
as those that contain in-banner video, those that are expandable/retractable, pop-ups, 
floating versions, and interstitials. An interstitial ad (interstitial means “in between”)

is a way of placing a full-page message between the current and destination pages of 
a user. Interstitials are usually inserted within a single website, and displayed as the 
user moves from one page to the next. The interstitial is typically contained in its own 
browser window and moves automatically to the page the user requested after allowing 
enough time for the ad to be read. Interstitials can also be deployed over an advertising 
network and appear as users move among websites. 
Because the Web is such a busy place, people have to find ways to cope with over-
stimulation. One means of coping is known as sensory input filtering. This means that 
people learn to filter out the vast majority of the messages coming at them. Internet 
users quickly learn at some level to recognize banner ads or anything that looks 
like a banner ad and to filter out most of the ads that are not exceptionally relevant. 
Interstitial messages, like TV commercials, attempt to make viewers a captive of the 
message. Typical interstitials last 10 seconds or less and force the user to look at the 
ad for that time period. IAB standards for pre-roll ads also limit their length. To avoid 
boring users, ads typically use animated graphics and music to entertain and inform 
them. A good interstitial will also have a “skip through” or “stop” option for users who 
have no interest in the message. 
The IAB also provides mobile rich media ad interface definitions (MRAID) in an 
effort to provide a set of standards designed to work with HTML5 and JavaScript that 
developers can use to create rich media ads to work with apps running on different 
mobile devices. The hope is make it easier to display ads across a wide variety of 
devices without having to rewrite code (Interactive Advertising Bureau, 2012).
Video Ads  Online video ads are TV-like advertisements that appear as in-page video 
commercials or before, during, or after a variety of content. Table 6.5 describes some 
of the IAB standards for video ads. The most widely used format is the “pre-roll” (fol-
lowed by the mid-roll and the post-roll) where users are forced to watch a video ad 
either before, in the middle of, or at the end of the video they originally clicked on. 
In 2014, the IAB released additional standards for five new in-stream and linear 
video ad

interactive video ad formats that enable advertisers to provide additional opportunities 
for consumer engagement.
Although from a total spending standpoint, online video ads are still very small 
when compared to the amount spent on search engine advertising, video ads are 
another fast growing form of online advertisement, accounting for about $10 billion 
in online advertising spending, which is expected to increase to $18 billion by 2020.
The rapid growth in video ads is due in part to the fact that video ads are far more 
effective than other display ad formats. For instance, according to research analyzing 
a variety of ad formats, in-stream video ads had click-through rates 12 times that of 
rich media and 27 times that of standard banner ads (MediaMind, 2012). Research by 
the IAB indicates that interactive digital video has even greater impact than typical, 
non-interactive video formats, with interaction rates three to four times higher, and 
brand awareness heightened by more than 50% (Interactive Advertising Bureau, 
2014).
There are many specialized video advertising networks that run video advertis-
ing campaigns for national advertisers and place these videos on their respective 
networks of websites. Firms can also establish their own video and television sites to 
promote their products. Retail sites are among the largest users of advertising videos. 
For instance, Zappos, the largest online shoe retailer, has a video for every one of its 
over 100,000 products.
Sponsorships  A sponsorship is a paid effort to tie an advertiser’s name to particular 
information, an event, or a venue in a way that reinforces its brand in a positive yet 
not overtly commercial manner. In 2016, companies will spend about $1.9 billion for 
sponsorship marketing. Sponsorships typically are more about branding than immedi-
ate sales. A common form of sponsorship is targeted content (or advertorials), in which 
editorial content is combined with an ad message to make the message more valuable 
and attractive to its intended audience. For instance, WebMD, the leading medical 
information website in the United States, displays sponsored pages on the WebMD 
website from companies such as Phillips to describe its home defibrillators, and Lilly 
to describe its pharmaceutical solutions for attention deficit disorders among children. 
Social media sponsorships, in which marketers pay for mentions in social media, such 
as blogs, tweets, or in online video, have also become a popular tactic. Sponsorships 
have also moved onto the mobile platform. For instance, Subaru sponsors an app called 
MapMyDogwalk, a GPS-enabled dog walking tool.
Native Advertising  Advertising that looks similar to editorial content is known as 
native advertising. Native advertising is not new. Traditional native advertising 
includes television infomercials, newspaper advertorials, and entire sections of news-
papers and magazines that are given over to advertisers, where the advertising looks 
similar to the rest of the publication. In the online world, native ads are most often 
found on social media, especially mobile social media, as part of a Facebook News 
Feed, Twitter Timeline, or Pinterest Promoted Pin. Mobile social networks do not have 
room for ads on the right side of the screen (the sidebar or right rail), and therefore 
native ads in the form of posts that look like other posts are the favored option. Native

advertising’s share of mobile display ad revenues has skyrocketed from 14% in 2012 
to over 50% in 2016 (eMarketer, Inc., 2016h).
Typically, native ads mimic the editorial content around them, and increasingly 
include video. They appear outside the normal or expected area for ads and are labeled 
to indicate they are not editorial content, although in most cases the word “ad” is 
not used. On the Web or mobile screens, native ads are usually distinguished by a 
“sponsored” tag underneath the headline, often in a different color. Online native 
advertising is growing rapidly, especially on social networks. In 2016, native ad spend-
ing is expected to reach almost $17 billion, surpassing spending on traditional display 
ads (eMarketer, Inc., 2016h). Federal Trade Commission researchers found that 73% 
of online publishers offer native advertising, including traditional publishers such as 
the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and many others. 
Researchers have found that 35% of online consumers cannot distinguish between 
editorial content and sponsored ads that look like editorial content, even if the ads are 
labelled as sponsored or promoted. Most consumers do not know what sponsored or 
promoted means. In a survey of 10,000 consumers, researchers found that consumers 
skip over labels like sponsored, and many do not understand the difference between 
paid and unpaid content (Franklyn, 2013). Yet market researchers have found that 
native ads are far more influential with consumers. Consumers look at native ads for 
about twice as long as they do banner ads, 53% more frequently than display ads; 
native ads raise purchase intent by 18%; and consumers are twice as likely to share a 
native ad with a family member as a regular ad. Marketers and advertisers are opposed 
to labeling native advertising with the word “ad” and instead prefer other tags. 
Native advertising is controversial. Critics contend that the purpose of native ads 
is to deceive or fool the consumer into thinking the ad has the same validity as the 
editorial content in media. In December 2015, the Federal Trade Commission issued an 
enforcement policy statement on deceptively formatted advertisements and guidelines 
setting forth explicit rules for native ads. The FTC said it would examine the entire ad, 
including factors such as its overall appearance, its similarity of its style to editorial 
content on the site on which it appears, and the degree to which it is distinguishable 
from such content. It further advised that labels indicting the commercial nature of 
the content need to be prominently displayed upon the viewer’s first contact with the 
contact (Federal Trade Commission, 2015a, 2015b). In 2016, in the first action under the 
new guidelines, the FTC charged that a native advertising campaign run by national 
retailer Lord & Taylor’s on Instagram deceived consumers. Lord & Taylor agreed to 
settle the complaint in March 2016 (Feil, 2016). 
Content Marketing  Native advertising is usually focused on partnering with a specific 
publisher. Content marketing creates a content campaign for a brand and then tries 
to secure placement on a variety of websites. Examples of content include articles, 
infographics, case studies, interactive graphics, white papers and even traditional press 
releases. The aim of content marketing is to increase visitors to a company’s website, 
organic search rankings, and brand engagement via social media (Libert, 2015). 
Advertising Networks  In the early years of e-commerce, firms placed ads on the few 
popular websites in existence, but by early 2000, there were hundreds of thousands 

	D i g i t a l  C o m m e r c e  M a r k e t i n g  a n d  A d v e r t i s i n g  S t r a t e g i e s  a n d  T o o l s  	 

of sites where ads could be displayed, and it became very inefficient for a single firm 
to purchase ads on each individual website. Most firms, even very large firms, did not 
have the capability by themselves to place banner ads and marketing messages on 
thousands of websites and monitor the results. Specialized marketing firms called 
advertising networks appeared to help firms take advantage of the powerful market-
ing potential of the Internet, and to make the entire process of buying and selling 
online ads more efficient and transparent. These ad networks have proliferated and 
have greatly increased the scale and liquidity of online marketing. 
Advertising networks represent the most sophisticated application of Internet 
database capabilities to date, and illustrate just how different Internet marketing 
is from traditional marketing. Advertising networks sell advertising and marketing 
opportunities (slots) to companies who wish to buy exposure to an online audience 
(advertisers). Advertising networks obtain their inventory of ad opportunities from 
a network of participating sites that want to display ads on their sites in return for 
receiving a payment from advertisers everytime a visitor clicks on an ad. These sites 
are usually referred to as web publishers. Marketers buy audiences and publishers sell 
audiences by attracting an audience and capturing audience information. Ad networks 
are the intermediaries who make this market work efficiently. 
Figure 6.7 illustrates how these systems work. Advertising networks begin with 
a consumer requesting a page from a member of the advertising network (1). A

connection is established with the third-party ad server (2). The ad server identifies 
the user by reading the cookie file on the user’s hard drive and checks its user profile 
database for the user’s profile (3). The ad server selects an appropriate banner ad based 
on the user’s previous purchases, interests, demographics, or other data in the profile 
(4). Whenever the user later goes online and visits any of the network member sites, 
the ad server recognizes the user and serves up the same or different ads regardless 
of the site content. The advertising network follows users from site to site through the 
use of web tracking files (5). 
Advertising Exchanges, Programmatic Advertising, Real-Time Bidding  Today, most 
online display advertising is being delivered by ad exchanges that use programmatic 
advertising and real-time bidding. An ad exchange is a digital marketplace that uses 
an automated auction-based method known as programmatic advertising to match 
supply and demand of online display advertising. Programmatic advertising uses a 
real-time bidding (RTB) process to match advertiser demand for display ads with 
publisher supply of web page space. Publishers are able to sell their inventory of empty 
web pages, often excess inventory that could not be sold directly. Want to contact males 
age 18 to 34, recent visitors to a car site, unmarried, high risk-taking profile, located 
in New York or California, urban home, and financial service industry employment? 
An ad exchange will allow you to bid in real time on this audience against other 
advertisers, and then manage the placement of ads, accounting, and measurement for 
your firm. Ad exchanges offer tremendous global scale and efficiency. One of the best 
known is Google’s DoubleClick Ad Exchange, which is based on more than 100 ad 
networks (the supply side), and provides a computer-based market for buyers to 
purchase audiences (the demand side). This exchange sells audiences sliced into 1,600 
interest categories. It displays more than 300 billion ad impressions a month across 2 
million websites worldwide, and maintains or distributes more than 500 million user 
profiles of Internet users (Kantrowitz, 2015, 2013). These profiles are based on web 
tracking files, offline purchase information, and social network data. Marketing firms, 
the buyers from publishers of websites, can target their audience and control the 
frequency and timing of ads during the day. The case study at the end of the chapter, 
Programmatic Advertising: Real Time Marketing, provides you with a further look at ad 
exchanges and real-time bidding.
Display Advertising Issues  As with search engine advertising, online display advertis-
ing is not without its issues, which include both ad fraud (similar to click fraud) and 
concerns about viewability (whether display ads are actually being seen).
Ad Fraud.  In 2016, the advertising industry has become increasingly concerned 
about the issue of ad fraud. Ad fraud involves the practice of falsifying web or mobile 
traffic in order to charge advertisers for impressions, clicks, or other actions that never 
actually occurred (eMarketer, Inc., 2016i). A study by the Interactive Advertising 
Bureau estimated that online advertisers are losing over $8 billion annually as a result 
of ad fraud (Scott, 2016). There are four primary sources of ad fraud. Botnets can be 
hired by publishers to click on their web pages to create phony traffic. Second, a

browser extension can insert ads into a premium publisher’s website, and then list the 
ads as available on a programmatic ad exchange. Third, ad targeting firms can create 
bots that imitate the behavior of real shoppers, and then charge advertisers for suc-
cessfully targeting consumers. Fourth, if you are a publisher looking to attract ads to 
your site, the simplest technique is simply to hire people in low-wage countries to 
click on your ads using a proxy server (Kantrowitz, 2014). 
Large advertisers have begun to hire online fraud detection firms (a growth indus-
try) to determine the extent of fraud in their campaigns. Verizon Wireless, L’Oreal, 
and Kellogg are among the firms that found millions of dollars of ad fraud in recent 
campaigns, and have demanded advertising networks to either reimburse them or 
generate real web traffic in the amount of the fraud. 
Viewability.  Recent research by Google revealed that 56% of the impressions 
served across its display advertising platforms, including DoubleClick, are not view-
able. There are a number of reasons for this situation. First, there is no mechanism 
for measuring how many people actually see an online ad that has been served. The 
same is true of most offline print and TV advertising, although several methods and 
certifications have been developed over decades to accurately measure audience expo-
sure. There are no such mechanisms for online advertising. Second, a large percentage 
of ads served appear lower down on the screen where users are less likely to go, or 
video ads on auto-play are playing in areas the user cannot see. Advertisers are still 
charged for ads that are served but not viewed. Unscrupulous publishers can place 
multiple ads on top of each other and charge multiple times for the same page space. 
Third, botnets can be programmed to click on ads on fraudulent websites, generating 
impressions and ad serves, but no one actually sees the ads. The Media Rating Council, 
an advertising industry group, released a very low standard for “viewability” in 2014: 
an ad is considered viewable if half of the ad can be viewed for at least one second. 
For video ads, half of the video needs to be viewable for two seconds (Hof, 2014). A 
revised version of the guidelines issued in August 2015 addressed some additional 
specific issues, but did not alter the baseline standard. In April 2016, the MRC issued 
proposed rules for mobile ads that set forth the same thresholds: 50% of the pixels 
in view for at least one second for display ads, and two seconds for video ads (Neff, 
2016). The advertisers who pay for online ads are beginning to demand guarantees 
of viewability. Several companies, including comScore, are offering tagging technol-
ogy that can partially measure viewability (Vranica, 2014). Unviewed ads are just as 
profitable as viewed ads for web publishers and advertising agencies. For advertisers, 
they represent the half of marketing expenditures that is wasted. 
Ad Blocking.  Over the past several years, use of ad-blocking software, which 
can eliminate display ads, pre-roll video ads, retargeted ads, and some types of native 
ads on desktops and laptops, has been growing. Ad blockers operate in a manner very 
similar to a firewall, recognizing and eliminating content based on IP address. Ad 
blockers have become very easy to install, with programs such as Adblock Plus offered 
as extensions for Firefox, Chrome, and other web browsers. Currently, almost 25% of 
Internet users in the United States are estimated to be employing ad blockers, with 
their most prevalent use among the younger, more technically advanced audience.

Gaming, newsgroup/forums, and social network sites are the most frequently affected 
by ad-blocking. Although advertisers are not yet panicked about ad blocking, it is a 
trend that they are watching with increasing concern. Some websites, such as Wired, 
The Guardian, and OKCupid, have made a direct appeal to their users to turn off their 
ad-blockers or to make a donation instead. 
E-mail Marketing 
When e-mail marketing began, unsolicited e-mail was not common. Direct e-mail 
marketing (e-mail marketing messages sent directly to interested users) was one of 
the first and most effective forms of online marketing communications. Direct e-mail 
marketing messages are sent to an opt-in audience of Internet users who, at one time 
or another, have expressed an interest in receiving messages from the advertiser. By 
sending e-mail to an opt-in audience, advertisers are targeting interested consumers. 
By far, in-house e-mail lists are more effective than purchased e-mail lists. Because of 
the comparatively high response rates and low cost, direct e-mail marketing remains 
a common form of online marketing communications. Other benefits of e-mail market-
ing include its mass reach, the ability to track and measure response, the ability to 
personalize content and tailor offers, the ability to drive traffic to websites for more 
interaction, the ability to test and optimize content and offers, and the ability to target 
by region, demographic, time of day, or other criteria. In 2016, U.S. companies will 
spend about $310 million on e-mail marketing, a relatively small amount when com-
pared to search and display ad marketing. But these numbers can be deceiving. E-mail 
marketing still packs a punch with solid customer response. Click-through rates for 
legitimate e-mail depend on the promotion (the offer), the product, and the amount 
of targeting, but average around 3%–4%. Despite the deluge of spam mail, e-mail 
remains a highly cost-effective way of communicating with existing customers, and 
to a lesser extent, finding new customers. Mobile devices have become the predomi-
nant method for accessing e-mail. A survey by Movable Ink showed that 69% of all 
e-mails sent on its platform in the fourth quarter of 2015 were opened on a smartphone 
or tablet computer, while only 31% were opened on a desktop or laptop (eMarketer, 
Inc., 2016j).
E-mail marketing and advertising is inexpensive and somewhat invariant to the 
number of mails sent. The cost of sending 1,000 e-mails is about the same as the cost 
to send 1 million. The primary cost of e-mail marketing is for the purchase of the list 
of names to which the e-mail will be sent. This generally costs anywhere from 5 to 20 
cents a name, depending on how targeted the list is. Sending the e-mail is virtually 
cost-free. In contrast, the cost to acquire the name, print, and mail a 5 x 7-inch direct 
mail post card is around 75 to 80 cents a name. 
While e-mail marketing often is sales-oriented, it can also be used as an integral 
feature of a multi-channel marketing campaign designed to strengthen brand recogni-
tion. Relevancy in the form of personalization and targeting are major themes in e-mail 
marketing in 2016. For instance, Jeep created an e-mail campaign to a targeted audi-
ence who had searched on SUVs, and visited Chrysler and Jeep Facebook pages. The 
e-mail campaign announced a contest based on a game users could play online that

involved tracking an arctic beast with a Jeep. Recipients could sign up on Facebook, 
Twitter, or the Jeep blog.
Although e-mail can still be an effective marketing and advertising tool, it faces 
three main challenges: spam, software tools used to control spam that eliminate much 
e-mail from user inboxes, and poorly targeted purchased e-mail lists. Spam is unso-
licited commercial e-mail (sometimes referred to as “junk” e-mail) and spammers are 
people who send unsolicited e-mail to a mass audience that has not expressed any 
interest in the product. Spammers tend to market pornography, fraudulent deals and 
services, scams, and other products not widely approved in most civilized societies. 
Legitimate direct opt-in e-mail marketing is not growing as fast as behaviorally targeted 
display ads and search engine advertising because of the explosion in spam. Consumer 
response to even legitimate e-mail campaigns has become more sophisticated. In 
general, e-mail works well for maintaining customer relationships but poorly for 
acquiring new customers. 
While click fraud may be the Achilles’ heel of search engine advertising, spam is 
the nemesis of effective e-mail marketing and advertising. The percentage of all e-mail 
that is spam averaged around 53% in 2016 (Symantec, 2016). Most spam originates 
from bot networks, which consist of thousands of captured PCs that can initiate and 
relay spam messages (see Chapter 5). Spam volume has declined somewhat since 
authorities took down the Rustock botnet in 2011. Spam is seasonally cyclical, and 
varies monthly due to the impact of new technologies (both supportive and discourag-
ing of spammers), new prosecutions, and seasonal demand for products and services. 
Legislative attempts in the United States to control spam have been mostly unsuc-
cessful. Thirty-seven states have laws regulating or prohibiting spam (National Confer-
ence of State Legislatures, 2015). State legislation typically requires that unsolicited 
mail (spam) contain a label in the subject line (“ADV”) indicating the message is an 
advertisement, requires a clear opt-out choice for consumers, and prohibits e-mail that 
contains false routing and domain name information (nearly all spammers hide their 
own domain, ISP, and IP address).
Congress passed the first national anti-spam law (“Controlling the Assault of Non-
Solicited Pornography and Marketing” or CAN-SPAM Act) in 2003, and it went into 
effect in January 2004. The act does not prohibit unsolicited e-mail (spam) but instead 
requires unsolicited commercial e-mail messages to be labeled (though not by a stan-
dard method) and to include opt-out instructions and the sender’s physical address. It 
prohibits the use of deceptive subject lines and false headers in such messages. The 
FTC is authorized (but not required) to establish a “Do Not E-mail” registry. State laws 
that require labels on unsolicited commercial e-mail or prohibit such messages entirely 
are pre-empted, although provisions merely addressing falsity and deception may 
remain in place. The act imposes fines of $10 for each unsolicited pornographic e-mail 
and authorizes state attorneys general to bring lawsuits against spammers. The act 
obviously makes lawful legitimate bulk mailing of unsolicited e-mail messages (what 
most people call spam), yet seeks to prohibit certain deceptive practices and provide a 
small measure of consumer control by requiring opt-out notices. In this sense, critics 
point out, CAN-SPAM ironically legalizes spam as long as spammers follow the rules.

For this reason, large spammers have been among the bill’s biggest supporters, and 
consumer groups have been the act’s most vociferous critics.
In contrast, Canada’s anti-spam law is one of the toughest in the world. Unlike the 
CAN-SPAM Act, Canada’s law is based on an opt-in model and prohibits the sending of 
commercial e-mail, texts, and social media messaging unless the recipient has given 
his or her consent. Violations of the law can lead to penalties of up to $1 million for 
individuals and $10 million for organizations. The first phase of the law went into 
effect in 2014. The law applies anytime a computer within Canada is used to send or 
access an electronic message, so companies located within the United States that send 
e-mail to Canada must comply with the law (French, 2014).
There have been a number of state and federal prosecutions of spammers, and 
private civil suits by large ISPs such as Microsoft. Volunteer efforts by industry are 
another potential control point. Notably, the Direct Marketing Association (DMA), an 
industry trade group that represents companies that use the postal mail system as well 
as e-mail for solicitations, is now strongly supporting legislative controls over spam, 
in addition to its voluntary guidelines. The DMA would like to preserve the legitimate 
use of e-mail as a marketing technique. The DMA has formed a 15-person anti-spam 
group and spends $500,000 a year trying to identify spammers. The DMA is also a 
supporter of the National Cyber-Forensics & Training Alliance (NCFTA), a nonprofit 
organization with close ties to the FBI. NCFTA operates a variety of initiatives aimed 
at combating cybercrime, including digital phishing via spam.
Affiliate Marketing 
Affiliate marketing is a form of marketing where a firm pays a commission, typically 
anywhere between 4% to 20%, to other websites (including blogs) for sending custom-
ers to their website. Affiliate marketing generally involves pay-for-performance: the 
affiliate or affiliate network gets paid only if users click on a link or purchase a product. 
According to Forrester Research, spending on affiliate marketing in the United States 
is expected to reach around $4.8 billion in 2016 (eMarketer, Inc., 2016k). Industry 
experts estimate that around 10% of all retail online sales are generated through affili-
ate programs (as compared to search engine ads, which account for more than 30% 
of online sales), and affiliate programs run by the Internet Retailer Top 500 have a 
median of 2,000 participating affiliates. 
Visitors to an affiliate website typically click on ads and are taken to the adver-
tiser’s website. In return, the advertiser pays the affiliate a fee, either on a per-click 
basis or as a percentage of whatever the customer spends on the advertiser’s site. 
Paying commissions for referrals or recommendations long predated the Web. 
For instance, Amazon has a strong affiliate program consisting of more than 1 
million participant sites, called Associates, which receive up to 10% in advertising 
fees on sales their referrals generate. Affiliates attract people to their blogs or websites 
where they can click on ads for products at Amazon. Members of eBay’s Affiliates 
Program can earn 40% to 80% of eBay’s revenue on winning bids and Buy It Now trans-
actions as well as $20 to $35 for each active registered user sent to eBay. Amazon, eBay, 
and other large e-commerce companies with affiliate programs typically administer 
affiliate marketing 
commissions paid by 
advertisers to affiliate 
websites for referring 
potential customers to their 
website

such programs themselves. Smaller e-commerce firms who wish to use affiliate mar-
keting often decide to join an affiliate network (sometimes called an affiliate broker), 
such as CJ Affiliate and Rakuten Linkshare, which acts as an intermediary. Bloggers 
often sign up for Google’s AdSense program to attract advertisers to their sites. They 
are paid for each click on an ad and sometimes for subsequent purchases made by 
visitors. 
Viral Marketing 
Just as affiliate marketing involves using a trusted website to encourage users to visit 
other sites, viral marketing is a form of social marketing that involves getting cus-
tomers to pass along a company’s marketing message to friends, family, and col-
leagues. It’s the online version of word-of-mouth advertising, which spreads even 
faster and further than in the real world. In the offline world, next to television, word 
of mouth is the second most important means by which consumers find out about 
new products. And the most important factor in the decision to purchase is the face-
to-face recommendations of parents, friends, and colleagues. Millions of online adults 
in the United States are “influencers” who share their opinions about products in a 
variety of online settings. In addition to increasing the size of a company’s customer 
base, customer referrals also have other advantages: they are less expensive to acquire 
because existing customers do all the acquisition work, and they tend to use online 
support services less, preferring to turn back to the person who referred them for 
advice. Also, because they cost so little to acquire and keep, referred customers begin 
to generate profits for a company much earlier than customers acquired through 
other marketing methods. There are a number of online venues where viral market-
ing appears. E-mail used to be the primary online venue for viral marketing (“please 
forward this e-mail to your friends”), but venues such as Facebook, Pinterest, Insta-
gram, Twitter, YouTube, and blogs now play a major role. For example, the most viral 
video ad of 2015 was an ad for Google’s Android that featured surprising pairings of 
different species of animals, such as elephants and dogs and bears and tigers, set to 
a song from the soundtrack of Disney’s animated film Robin Hood. The video was 
shared more than 6.4 million times.
Lead Generation Marketing
Lead generation marketing uses multiple e-commerce presences to generate leads 
for businesses who later can be contacted and converted into customers through sales 
calls, e-mail, or other means. In one sense, all Internet marketing campaigns attempt 
to develop leads. But lead generation marketing is a specialized subset of the Internet 
marketing industry that provides consulting services and software tools to collect and 
manage leads for firms, and to convert these leads to customers. Companies will spend 
an estimated $1.9 billion on lead generation marketing in 2016. Sometimes called 
“inbound marketing,” lead generation marketing firms help other firms build websites, 
launch e-mail campaigns, use social network sites and blogs to optimize the generation 
of leads, and then manage those leads by initiating further contacts, tracking interac-
tions, and interfacing with customer relationship management systems to keep track

SOCIAL, MOBILE, AND LOCAL MARKETING AND ADVERTISING
In this section we provide a very brief overview of the social, mobile, and local market-
ing and advertising landscape. Then, in Chapter 7, we provide a much more in-depth 
examination of social, mobile, and local marketing and advertising tools. 
Social Marketing and Advertising
Social marketing/advertising involves the use of online social networks and communi-
ties to build brands and drive sales revenues. There are several kinds of social net-
works, from Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram, to social apps, social games, 
blogs, and forums (websites that attract people who share a community of interests or 
skills). In 2016, companies are expected to spend about $15 billion on social network 
marketing and advertising. Next to mobile marketing, it is the fastest growing type 
of online marketing. Nevertheless, in 2016, it represents only about 21% of all online 
marketing and is still dwarfed by the amount spent on search engine advertising and 
display advertising (eMarketer, Inc., 2016l).
Marketers cannot ignore the huge audiences that social networks such as Face-
book, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram are gathering, which rival television and radio 
in size. In 2016, there were about 1.7 billion Facebook members, around 500 million 
Instagram users, over 300 million active Twitter users, around 500 million Instagram 
users, and over 100 million Pinterest members worldwide. In the United States, in 
August 2016, Facebook had about 160 million unique visitors. Around 57% of the U.S. 
population visits social network sites. It’s little wonder that marketers and advertis-
ers are joyous at the prospect of connecting with this large audience. Almost 90% of 
U.S. companies are using social media for marketing purposes in 2016, and research 
has found that social network users are more likely to talk about and recommend a 
company or product they follow on a social network.
Social networks offer advertisers all the main advertising formats, including 
banner ads (the most common), short pre-roll and post-roll ads associated with videos, 
and sponsorship of content. Having a corporate Facebook page is in itself a marketing 
tool for brands just like a web page. Many firms, such as Coca-Cola, have shut down 
product-specific web pages and instead use Facebook pages. 
Blogs and online games can also be used for social marketing. Blogs have been 
around for a decade and are a part of the mainstream online culture (see Chapter 
3 for a description of blogs). Around 29 million people write blogs, and around 80 
million read blogs. Blogs play a vital role in online marketing. Although more firms 
use Twitter and Facebook, these sites have not replaced blogs, and in fact often point 
to blogs for long-form content. Because blog readers and creators tend to be more 
educated, have higher incomes, and be opinion leaders, blogs are ideal platforms for 
ads for many products and services that cater to this kind of audience. Because blogs 
are based on the personal opinions of the writers, they are also an ideal platform to 
start a viral marketing campaign. Advertising networks that specialize in blogs provide 
some efficiency in placing ads, as do blog networks, which are collections of a small

number of popular blogs, coordinated by a central management team, and which can 
deliver a larger audience to advertisers. For more information on social marketing 
using blogs, see Learning Track 6.3.
The online gaming marketplace continues to expand rapidly as users increas-
ingly play games on smartphones and tablets, as well as PCs and consoles. The story 
of game advertising in 2016 is social, mobile, and local: social games are ascendant, 
mobile devices are the high-growth platform, and location-based advertising is starting 
to show real traction. The objective of game advertising is both branding and driving 
customers to purchase moments at restaurants and retail stores. In 2016, around 180 
million people play games on their mobile phones, about 52 million play on consoles, 
while about 122 million play on tablets. Of the online gamers, about 95 million play 
social games, such as Jackbox Games’ You Don’t Know Jack. Advertisers are expected 
to spend about $336 million on in-game social game advertising in 2016 (eMarketer, 
Inc., 2016m).
Mobile Marketing and Advertising
Marketing on the mobile platform has exploded and now constitutes almost two-thirds 
(64%) of the overall $72 billion expected to spent on online marketing in 2016. In 2016, 
spending on all forms of mobile marketing is estimated to be about $46 billion, and it 
will almost double, to around $87 billion, by 2020 (eMarketer, Inc., 2016n). A number 
of factors are driving advertisers to the mobile platform, including much more power-
ful devices, faster networks, wireless local networks, rich media and video ads, and 
growing demand for local advertising by small business and consumers. Most impor-
tant, mobile is where the eyeballs are now and increasingly will be in the future: about 
210 million people access the Internet at least some of the time from mobile devices.
Mobile marketing includes the use of display banner ads, rich media, video, 
games, e-mail, text messaging, in-store messaging, Quick Response (QR) codes, and 
couponing. Mobile is now a required part of the standard marketing budget. In 2016, 
display ads are expected to be the most popular mobile advertising format, account-
ing for about 52% of all mobile ad spending. Display ads can be served as a part of a 
mobile website or inside apps and games. Facebook is the leader in mobile display 
ad revenues, followed by Google and Twitter. Search advertising is also a popular 
format, and is expected to account for about 44% of mobile ad spending in 2016. 
Search ads can be further optimized for the mobile platform by showing ads based 
on the physical location of the user. Mobile messaging generally involves SMS text 
messaging to consumers offering coupons or flash marketing messages. Messaging is 
especially effective for local advertising because consumers can be sent messages and 
coupons as they pass by or visit locations. Video advertising currently accounts for a 
small percentage of mobile ad spending, but is one of the fastest growing formats. Ad 
networks such as Google’s AdMob, Apple’s iAd, Twitter’s MoPub, and Millennial Media 
are also important players in the mobile advertising market. 
Apps on mobile devices constitute a marketing platform that did not exist a 
few years ago. Apps are a nonbrowser pathway for users to experience the Web and 
perform a number of tasks from reading the newspaper to shopping, searching, and 
buying. Apps provide users much faster access to content than do multi-purpose

browsers. Apps have begun to influence the design and function of traditional websites 
as consumers are attracted to the look and feel of apps, and their speed of operation. 
There are over 5 million apps available on Apple’s App Store and Google Play and 
another million apps provided by Internet carriers and third-party storefronts. Over 
2 billion people worldwide will use apps in 2016.
Local Marketing: The Social-Mobile-Local Nexus
Along with social marketing and mobile marketing, local marketing is the third major 
trend in e-commerce marketing in 2016–2017. The growth of mobile devices has 
accelerated the growth of local search and purchasing. New marketing tools like local 
advertisements on social networks and daily deal sites are also contributing to local 
marketing growth. 
Spending on online local ads in the United States is estimated at around $45 
billion in 2016. The mobile portion of local advertising spending is expected to reach 
$12.8 billion in 2016 (BIA/Kelsey, 2016a). In contrast, spending on traditional local 
advertising is expected to be flat during the same time period. The most common local 
marketing tools are geotargeting using Google Maps (local stores appearing on a Google 
map), display ads in hyperlocal publications like those created by Patch Properties, 
daily deals, and coupons. 
The most commonly used venues include Facebook, Google, Linked­In, Yahoo, 
Bing, and Twitter, as well as more specific location-based offerings such as Google My 
Business, Yahoo Local, Citysearch, YP, SuperPages, and Yelp. The “daily deal” coupon 
sites, Groupon and LivingSocial, and location-based mobile firms such as Foursquare 
are also a significant part of this trend.
We examine social, mobile, and local marketing in much greater depth in Chapter 7. 
MULTI-CHANNEL MARKETING: INTEGRATING ONLINE AND OFFLINE 
MARKETING 
Without an audience, marketing is not possible. With the rapid growth of the Internet, 
media consumption patterns have changed greatly as consumers are more and more 
likely to engage with online media, from videos and news sites, to blogs, Twitter feeds, 
Facebook friends, and Pinterest posts. Increasingly, marketers are using multiple 
online channels to “touch” customers, from e-mail to Facebook, search ads, display 
ads on mobile devices, and affiliate programs. Forrester Research reports, for instance, 
that most customers purchased online following some web marketing influence, and 
nearly half of online purchases followed multiple exposures to web marketing efforts 
(Forrester Research, 2016). 
In 2013, for the first time ever, the average American spent more time with digital 
media per day than the amount viewing TV. In 2016, the average adult will spend about 
5 hours and 45 minutes a day online and using a mobile device for something other 
than telephone calls, compared to about 4 hours and 5 minutes watching television 
(see Figure 6.8) (eMarketer, Inc., 2016b). An increasing percentage of American 
media consumers multitask by using several media at once in order to increase the 
total media exposure. In this environment, marketers increasingly are developing

multi-channel marketing programs that can take advantage of the strengths of various 
media, and reinforce branding messages across media. Online marketing is not the 
only way, or by itself the best way, to engage consumers. Internet campaigns can be 
significantly strengthened by also using e-mail, TV, print, and radio. The marketing 
communications campaigns most successful at driving traffic to a website have incor-
porated both online and offline tactics, rather than relying solely on one or the other. 
Several research studies have shown that the most effective online advertisements 
are those that use consistent imagery with campaigns running in other media at the 
same time.

luxury goods providers use online marketing in conjunction with their offline market-
ing efforts.
OTHER ONLINE MARKETING STRATEGIES
In addition to the “traditional” online marketing and advertising tools we have previ-
ously discussed, such as search engine, display, and e-mail marketing, and the newer 
social, mobile, and local marketing and advertising tools, there are also a number of 
other, more focused online marketing strategies. Here we examine tools aimed at 
customer retention, pricing, and a strategy known as the “long tail.”

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
ARE THE VERY RICH DIFFERENT FROM YOU 
AND ME? 
“Let me tell you about the very rich. 
They are different from you and me.” 
So observed F. Scott Fitzgerald in 
the short story, “The Rich Boy.” Palm 
Beach has its Worth Avenue, New York has 
its Fifth Avenue, Los Angeles has its Rodeo Drive, 
and Chicago has the Magnificent Mile. So where 
do the rich go to get that $5,000 cocktail dress or 
that $3,000 Italian suit online? It turns out they 
may not be so different from the rest of us: they 
look for online deals and situations where quality 
can be had at a bargain. 
Even experts find it hard to define what it 
means to be affluent. About 25% of all U.S. 
households (about 31 million) have annual 
household income of $100,000 or above. These 
are often referred to as HENRYs (High Earnings, 
Not Yet Rich). But the really affluent (sometimes 
called the hyperaffluent) are those 2.5 million (the 
top 2% of U.S. households) that earn more than 
$350,000 a year. And then there are the 9 million 
households (0.7% of households) that earn more 
than $1 million a year. These are the ultra-rich. 
Retail consumption in general is highly 
skewed: the wealthiest top 10% of households 
account for about 50% of all retail spending 
and over 35% of all e-commerce retail spending. 
Wealthy Americans are opening their wallets to 
spend on expensive clothing, accessories, jewelry, 
and beauty products, and increasingly, purchasing 
luxury products online. A 2016 Boston Consulting 
Group report notes what consumers hear or see 
online influences almost 60% of luxury product 
buying decisions.
The Yoox Net-a-Porter Group is one of the 
world’s leading online luxury fashion retail-
ers, reaching over 170 countries. Luxury goods 
designers would not even consider selling to 
Net-a-Porter when it initially launched in 2000. 
Affluent women in that period only bought clothes 
they had seen, touched and tried on. That all has 
changed in the last decade, and in 2015, the Yoox 
Net-a-Porter group had revenue of over $1.9 
billion. Net-a-Porter currently sells over 400 of 
the world’s most fashionable high-end brands from 
Gucci to Tory Burch and was selected by Chanel 
as the exclusive online vendor for Chanel’s first 
fine jewelry collection. In 2016, Tiffany began 
selling select collections on Net-a-Porter as well, 
the first time it is selling merchandise through 
another online retailer. In 2015, Net-a-Porter 
launched an app called the Net Set in an effort 
to create a mobile social commerce network for 
luxury consumers. The app provides each designer 
with its own mobile brand portal, as well as a live 
feed of trending luxury items. Net-a-Porter also 
created a new Android native app for its Christ-
mas campaign. These investments played a key role 
in the increase in the Yoox Net-a-Porter’s 2015 
revenue, with mobile constituting almost 40% of 
the Group’s sales, boosted by new native app sales, 
which surged by 180%.
Even the rich are not immune to the lure of a 
good deal. The problem is that luxury retailers are 
typically loath to offer sales because they believe 
sales detract from their reputations. To get around 
this problem, luxury retailers often offer “secret” 
discounts via flash e-mail campaigns and private 
online sales in which selected online customers 
are e-mailed alerts. Neiman Marcus calls them 
Midday Dash sales: two-hour online-only sales 
with 50% off on luxury goods that can be pur-
chased only by clicking a link in the e-mail. 
Luxury retailers have another dilemma: they 
need to attract not just the ultra-affluent, but 
also the aspirational HENRYs who are far more 

	D i g i t a l  C o m m e r c e  M a r k e t i n g  a n d  A d v e r t i s i n g  S t r a t e g i e s  a n d  T o o l s  	 

numerous and anxious to display their wealth. 
They need to be both exclusive and accessible. 
One solution is the so-called Mercedes Benz strat-
egy: build luxurious but affordable cars for the 
HENRYs while maintaining a focus on high-end 
truly luxury models for the ultra-affluent. Mer-
cedes Benz combines a dual level product strategy 
with effective use of social and mobile media. Mer-
cedes’ Facebook page is a main hub of interaction 
between the brand and its customers, with over 20 
million fans entertained with sweepstakes, videos, 
images, news, and links to its blog for additional 
insight into why Mercedes is unique and worth all 
that money. Mercedes also uses Twitter, YouTube, 
Instagram, Pinterest, and a dozen mobile apps to 
engage a broader range of customers by providing 
personalized video tours of its cars. 
The explosion of social media and the increas-
ing investments in the online channel by luxury 
companies has reinforced and enlarged the com-
munity of those who explore, comment upon, and 
eventually purchase luxury goods. For instance, 
the Burberry Group, the United Kingdom’s largest 
luxury goods maker, has more than 42 million 
followers across 20 global platforms. Burberry 
reports that it obtains the most reach and most 
response from digital initiatives compared with 
other media. To promote the Burberry Body fra-
grance, the London-based company offered exclu-
sive samples to its Facebook fans. It received more 
than 225,000 requests in little more than a week.
Developing an online marketing approach 
that increases a company’s access to consumers 
while retaining an image of exclusivity was the 
challenge faced by Tiffany & Co. The company is 
in the enviable position of being perhaps the most 
famous jewelry company in the United States. Tif-
fany’s offline marketing communications seek to 
engender feelings of beauty, quality, and timeless 
style—all hallmarks of the Tiffany brand. 
How does Tiffany maintain its approach 
on the Web, a medium that often empha-
sizes speed and flashy graphics over grace and 
elegance, and low-cost bargains over high-priced 
exclusive fashion? The Web, for the most part, is 
all about low prices and great deals—concepts 
that are anathema to the high-fashion merchants 
like Tiffany. The answer is apparent in a visit to 
the Tiffany website. The site features limited inven-
tory, with a focus on high-resolution images of 
its exclusive and original designs in jewelry and 
apparel. There are no sales, coupons, discounts, 
or other offers although visitors can choose 
jewelry in lower price ranges (less than $250 
for instance). The website and Facebook brand 
page reflect custom service and design, calm, and 
simplicity. The prices are equally exclusive: an 
exquisite Atlas Hinged Bangle in 18k rose gold 
and round brilliant diamonds for $9,000, and 
sunglasses for $500. 
Today, Tiffany has shifted more of its direct 
marketing effort from the offline catalog to the 
online catalog and an increasing social media 
presence, including Facebook (almost 9 million 
Likes), Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Tumblr, and 
YouTube. In a December 2015 study by Engage-
ment Labs of 100,000 brands, Tiffany ranked 
second overall on Facebook and first on Twitter 
among luxury brands in terms of the effective-
ness of its engagement with consumers on social 
media. It has websites in 13 different countries, 
including Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, 
and Australia, and as noted previously, has begun 
to sell selected products on Net-a-Porter in an 
effort to increase its global reach. Tiffany sites 
carry over 2,100 products in six categories of 
goods: engagement, jewelry, watches, designers 
and collections, gifts, and accessories.

Customer Retention Strategies
The Internet offers several extraordinary marketing techniques for building a strong 
relationship with customers and for differentiating products and services.
Personalization, One-to-One Marketing, and Interest-based Advertising (Behavioral 
Targeting)  No Internet-based marketing technique has received more popular and 
academic comment than “one-to-one” or “personalized marketing.” One-to-one mar-
keting (personalization) segments the market on the basis of individuals (not 
groups), based on a precise and timely understanding of their needs, targeting specific 
marketing messages to these individuals, and then positioning the product vis-à-vis 
competitors to be truly unique. One-to-one marketing is the ultimate form of market 
segmentation, targeting, and positioning—where the segments are individuals.
The movement toward market segmentation has been ongoing since the develop-
ment of systematic market research and mass media in the 1930s. However, e-com-
merce and the Internet are different in that they enable personalized one-to-one 
marketing to occur on a mass scale. A recent survey found that 85% of companies 
were implementing some form of personalization for online customer interactions in 
2016, and of those organizations not yet doing so, over half planned to use website or 
in-app personalization within the next year. Of those using personalization, almost 
90% reported a lift or improvement as a result (Evergage, 2016).
The Amazon and Barnes & Noble websites are good examples of personalization 
at work. Both sites greet registered visitors (based on cookie files), recommend recent 
books based on user preferences (stored in a user profile in their database) as well as 
what other consumers purchased, and expedite checkout procedures based on prior 
purchases.
Behavioral targeting involves using the online and offline behavior of consumers 
to adjust the advertising messages delivered to them online, often in real time (mil-
liseconds from the consumer’s first URL entry). The intent is to increase the efficiency 
of marketing and advertising, and to increase the revenue streams of firms who are 
in a position to behaviorally target visitors. Because behavioral targeting as a label has 
somewhat unfavorable connotations, the online advertising industry, led by Google, 
has introduced a new name for behavioral targeting. They call it interest-based adver-
tising (IBA).
One of the original promises of the Web has been that it can deliver a marketing 
message tailored to each consumer based on this data, and then measure the results 
in terms of click-throughs and purchases. If you are visiting a jewelry site, you would 
be shown jewelry ads. If you entered a search query like “diamonds,” you would be 
shown text ads for diamonds and other jewelry. This was taken one step further by 
advertising networks composed of several thousand sites. An advertising network 
could follow you across thousands of websites and come up with an idea of what you 
are interested in as you browse, and then display ads related to those interests. For 
instance, if you visit a few men’s clothing sites in the course of a few hours, you will 
be shown ads for men’s clothing on most other sites you visit subsequently, regardless 
of their subject content. If you search for a certain pair of shoes at Zappos, and Like 
them to your friends on Facebook, you will be shown ads for the exact same shoes at

other sites (including Facebook). Behavioral targeting combines nearly all of your 
online behavioral data into a collection of interest areas, and then shows you ads based 
on those interests, as well as the interests of your friends. What’s new about today’s 
behavioral targeting is the breadth of data collected: your e-mail content, social 
network page content, friends, purchases online, books read or purchased, newspaper 
sites visited, and many other behaviors. And finally, ad exchanges take the marketing 
of all this information one step further. Most popular websites have more than 100 
tracking programs on their home pages that are owned by third-party data collector 
firms who then sell this information in real time to the highest bidding advertiser in 
real-time online auctions. Ad exchanges make it possible for advertisers to retarget ads 
at individuals as they roam across the Internet. Retargeting involves showing the 
same or similar ads to individuals across multiple websites. Retargeting has become 
a popular tactic, in large part due to its perceived effectiveness. For instance, marketers 
often use retargeting in an attempt to reach users who have abandoned a shopping 
cart. A recent survey found that over 90% of marketers believe retargeting ads per-
forms equal or better than search advertising or e-mail. However, as more and more 
consumers use multiple devices, including mobile devices, for online access, the 
ability to retarget ads across devices is becoming a topic of great interest to marketers 
(Marin Software, 2014; AdRoll, 2015; eMarketer, Inc., 2015).
There are four methods that online advertisers use to behaviorally target ads: 
search engine queries, the collection of data on individual browsing history online 
(monitoring the clickstream), the collection of data from social network sites, and 
increasingly, the integration of this online data with offline data like income, educa-
tion, address, purchase patterns, credit records, driving records, and hundreds of other 
personal descriptors tied to specific, identifiable persons. This level of integration 
of both “anonymous” as well as identifiable information is routinely engaged in by 
Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, and legions of small and medium-sized marketing 
firms that use their data, or collect data from thousands of websites using web beacons 
and cookies. On average, online information bureaus maintain 2,000 data elements on 
each adult person in their database. The currency and accuracy of this data are never 
examined, and the retention periods are not known. Currently, there are no federal 
laws or regulations governing this data.
Earlier in the chapter we described search engine advertising in some detail. 
Search engine advertising has turned out to be the most effective online advertising 
format by several orders of magnitude, and provides more than 95% of the revenue of 
Google, the world’s largest online advertising agency. Why is search engine advertising 
so effective? Most agree that when users enter a query into a search engine, it reveals a 
very specific intention to shop, compare, and possibly purchase. When ads are shown 
at these very moments of customer behavior, they are 4 to 10 times as effective as 
other formats. The author John Battelle coined the phrase and the notion that the 
Web is a database of intentions composed of the results from every search ever made 
and every path that searchers have followed, since the beginning of the Web. In total, 
this database contains the intentions of all mankind. This treasure trove of intentions, 
desires, likes, wants, and needs is owned by Google, Microsoft, and to a lesser extent, 
Yahoo (Battelle, 2003). Battelle later extended the concept of a database of intentions

individuals across
multiple websites

beyond search to include the social graph (Facebook), status updates (Twitter and 
Facebook), and the “check-in” (Foursquare and Yelp) (Battelle, 2010). The database of 
intentions can be exploited to track and target individuals and groups. Not only is this 
capability unprecedented, but it’s growing exponentially into the foreseeable future. 
The potential for abuse is also growing exponentially. 
The decline in the growth rate of search engine advertising caused the major 
search engine firms to seek out alternative forms of future growth, which include 
display, rich media, and video advertising on millions of web publisher sites. Web 
publishers have responded by producing billions of pages of content. In this environ-
ment, the effectiveness of display ads has been falling in terms of response rates 
and prices for ads. Behavioral targeting is an effective way to solve this problem and 
increase response rates. Behavioral targeting of both search and display advertising is 
currently driving the expansion in online advertising. 
Behavioral targeting seeks to optimize consumer response by using information 
that web visitors reveal about themselves online, and if possible, to combine this with 
offline identity and consumption information gathered by companies such as Acxiom. 
Behavioral targeting is based on real-time information about visitors’ use of websites, 
including pages visited, content viewed, search queries, ads clicked, videos watched, 
content shared, and products they purchased. Once this information is collected and 
analyzed on the fly, behavioral targeting programs attempt to develop profiles of 
individual users, and then show advertisements most likely to be of interest to the 
user. More than 80% of North American advertisers use some form of targeting in their 
online display ads (Forrester Research, 2014).
For a variety of technical and other reasons, this vision has, thus far, not been 
widely achieved. The percentage of ads that are actually targeted is unknown. Many 
advertisers use less expensive context ads displayed to a general audience without 
any targeting, or very minimal demographic targeting. The quality of the data, largely 
owned by the online advertising networks, is quite good but hardly perfect. The ability 
to understand and respond—the business intelligence and real-time analytics—is still 
weak, preventing companies from being able to respond quickly in meaningful ways 
when the consumer is online. The firms who sell targeted ads to their clients claim 
the targeted ads are two or three times more effective than general ads. There is not 
very good data to support these claims from independent sources. Generally these 
claims confound the impact of brands on targeted audiences, and the impact of the ads 
placed to this targeted audience. Advertisers target groups that are most likely to buy 
their product even in the absence of targeting ads at them. The additional impact of a 
targeted ad is much smaller than ad platforms claim. A research report based on real 
data from 18 ad campaigns on Yahoo, involving 18.4 million users, found that brand 
interest is the largest single factor in determining targeted ad effectiveness, and not 
the targeted ad itself (Farahat and Bailey, 2012). And marketing companies are not 
yet prepared to accept the idea that there needs to be several hundred or a thousand 
variations on the same display ad depending on the customer’s profile. Such a move 
would raise costs. Last, consumer resistance to targeting continues. A recent survey 
found that over 90% of Americans are opposed to having companies track their online

behavior even if they receive a free service or product (Joe, 2016). Some consum-
ers find marketing messages that are too personalized to be “creepy.” For example, 
suppose you visited the Hanes website to look at underclothing. How would you feel 
about receiving an unsolicited e-mail from Hanes thanking you for your visit and 
asking you to come back? How would you feel about getting a similar text message or 
telephone call, or being served a constant array of underclothing ads as you traverse 
the Web? What if a company mined your Pinterest pins, Facebook posts, or Twitter 
feed? Although some consumers might not be disturbed by this, many others find it to 
be “off-putting” at the very least. The public and congressional reaction to behavioral 
targeting is described more fully in Chapter 8.
Customization and Customer Co-Production  Customization is an extension of person-
alization. Customization means changing the product—not just the marketing 
message—according to user preferences. Customer co-production means the users 
actually think up the innovation and help create the new product.
Many leading companies now offer “build-to-order” customized products on the 
Internet on a large scale, creating product differentiation and, hopefully, customer 
loyalty. Customers appear to be willing to pay a little more for a unique product. The 
key to making the process affordable is to build a standardized architecture that lets 
consumers combine a variety of options. For example, Nike offers customized sneakers 
through its NIKEiD program on its website. Consumers can choose the type of shoe, 
colors, material, and even a logo of up to eight characters. Nike transmits the orders via 
computers to specially equipped plants in China and Korea. At the My M&M’s website, 
customers can get their own message printed on custom-made M&Ms.
Information goods—goods whose value is based on information content—are also 
ideal for this level of differentiation. For instance, the New York Times—and many 
other content distributors—allows customers to select the news they want to see on 
a daily basis. Many websites, particularly portal sites such as Yahoo, MSN, and AOL, 
allow customers to create their own customized version of the website. Such pages 
frequently require security measures such as usernames and passwords to ensure 
privacy and confidentiality.
Customer Service  A website’s approach to customer service can significantly help 
or hurt its marketing efforts. Online customer service is more than simply following 
through on order fulfillment; it has to do with users’ ability to communicate with a 
company and obtain desired information in a timely manner. Customer service can 
help reduce consumer frustration, cut the number of abandoned shopping carts, and 
increase sales.
Most consumers want to, and will, serve themselves as long as the information 
they need to do so is relatively easy to find. Online buyers largely do not expect or 
desire “high-touch” service unless they have questions or problems, in which case 
they want relatively speedy answers that are responsive to their individual issue. 
Researchers have found that online consumers strongly attach to brands when they 
have a problem with an order. Customer loyalty increases substantially when online 
customization 
changing the product, not 
just the marketing 
message, according to user 
preferences
customer co-
production 
in the web environment, 
takes customization one 
step further by allowing 
the customer to interac-
tively create the product

buyers learn that customer service representatives are available online or at an 
800-number and were willing and able to resolve the situation quickly. Conversely, 
online buyers who do not receive satisfaction at these critical moments often termi-
nate their relationship with the business and switch to merchants that may charge 
more but deliver superior customer service (Ba et al., 2010; Wolfinbarger and Gilly, 
2001).
There are a number of tools that companies can use to encourage interaction 
with prospects and customers and provide customer service—FAQs, customer service 
chat systems, intelligent agents, and automated response systems—in addition to the 
customer relationship management systems described in the preceding section.
Frequently asked questions (FAQs), a text-based listing of common questions 
and answers, provide an inexpensive way to anticipate and address customer concerns. 
Adding an FAQ page on a website linked to a search engine helps users track down 
needed information more quickly, enabling them to help themselves resolve questions 
and concerns. By directing customers to the FAQs page first, websites can give custom-
ers answers to common questions. If a question and answer do not appear, it is impor-
tant for sites to make contact with a live person simple and easy. Offering an e-mail 
link to customer service at the bottom of the FAQs page is one solution.
Real-time customer service chat systems (in which a company’s customer 
service representatives interactively exchange text-based messages with one or more 
customers on a real-time basis) are an increasingly popular way for companies to 
assist online shoppers during a purchase. Chats with online customer service rep-
resentatives can provide direction, answer questions, and troubleshoot technical 
glitches that can kill a sale. Leading vendors of customer service chat systems 
include LivePerson and ClickDesk. Vendors claim that chat is significantly less 
expensive than telephone-based customer service. However, critics point out this 
conclusion may be based on optimistic assumptions that chat representatives can 
assist three or four customers at once, and that chat sessions are shorter than phone 
sessions. Also, chat sessions are text sessions, and not as rich as talking with a human 
being over the phone. On the plus side, chat has been reported to raise per-order 
sales figures, providing sales assistance by allowing companies to “touch” customers 
during the decision-making process. Evidence suggests that chat can lower shopping 
cart abandonment rates, increase the number of items purchased per transaction, 
and increase the dollar value of transactions. “Click to call” or “live call” is another 
version of a real-time online customer service system, in which the customer clicks 
a link or accepts an invitation to have a customer service representative call them 
on the telephone.
Intelligent agent technology is another way customers are providing assistance 
to online shoppers. Intelligent agents are part of an effort to reduce costly contact 
with customer service representatives. Automated response systems send e-mail 
order confirmations and acknowledgments of e-mailed inquiries, in some cases 
letting the customer know that it may take a day or two to actually research an 
answer to their question. Automated shipping confirmations and order status reports 
are also common.

Pricing Strategies
As we noted in Chapter 1, during the early years of e-commerce, many academics and 
business consultants predicted that the Web would lead to a new world of information 
symmetry and “frictionless” commerce. In this world, newly empowered customers, 
using intelligent shopping agents and the nearly infinite product and price information 
available on the Internet, would shop around the world (and around the clock) with 
minimal effort, driving prices down to their marginal cost and driving intermediaries 
out of the market as customers began to deal directly with producers (Wigand and 
Benjamin, 1995; Rayport and Sviokla, 1995; Evans and Wurster, 1999; Sinha, 2000). 
The result was supposed to be an instance of the Law of One Price: with complete 
price transparency in a perfect information marketplace, one world price for every 
product would emerge. Frictionless commerce would, of course, mean the end of 
marketing based on brands. 
But it didn’t work out this way. Firms still compete for customers through price 
as well as product features, scope of operations, and focus. Pricing (putting a value 
on goods and services) is an integral part of marketing strategy. Together, price and 
quality determine customer value. Pricing of e-commerce goods has proved very dif-
ficult for both entrepreneurs and investors to understand.
In traditional firms, the prices of traditional goods—such as books, drugs, and 
automobiles—are usually based on their fixed and variable costs as well as the market’s 
demand curve (the quantity of goods that can be sold at various prices). Fixed costs 
are the costs of building the production facility. Variable costs are costs involved in 
running the production facility—mostly labor. In a competitive market, with undif-
ferentiated goods, prices tend toward their marginal costs (the incremental cost of 
producing the next unit) once manufacturers have paid the fixed costs to enter the 
business.
Firms usually “discover” their demand curves by testing various price and volume 
bundles, while closely watching their cost structure. Normally, prices are set to maxi-
mize profits. A profit-maximizing company sets its prices so that the marginal revenue 
(the revenue a company receives from the next unit sold) from a product just equals 
its marginal costs. If a firm’s marginal revenue is higher than its marginal costs, it 
would want to lower prices a bit and sell more product (why leave money on the table 
when you can sell a few more units?). If its marginal revenue for selling a product is 
lower than its marginal costs, then the company would want to reduce volume a bit 
and charge a higher price (why lose money on each additional sale?).
In the early years of e-commerce, something unusual happened. Sellers were 
pricing their products far below their marginal costs. Some sites were losing money 
on every sale. How could this be? New economics? New technology? The Internet 
age? No. Internet merchants could sell below their marginal costs (even giving away 
products for free) simply because a large number of entrepreneurs and their venture 
capitalist backers thought this was a worthwhile activity, at least in the short term. 
The idea was to attract eyeballs with free goods and services, and then later, once the 
consumer was part of a large, committed audience, charge advertisers enough money 
to make a profit, and (maybe) charge customers subscription fees for value-added

services (the so-called “piggyback” strategy in which a small number of users can be 
convinced to pay for premium services that are piggybacked upon a larger audience 
that receives standard or reduced value services). To a large extent, social network 
sites and user-generated content sites have resurrected this revenue model with a 
focus on the growth in audience size and not short-term profits. To understand the 
behavior of entrepreneurial firms, it is helpful to examine a traditional demand curve 
(see Figure 6.9).
A small number of customers are willing to pay a great deal for the product—far 
above P1. A larger number of customers would happily pay P1, and an even larger number 
of customers would pay less than P1. If the price were zero, the demand might approach 
infinity! Ideally, in order to maximize sales and profits, a firm would like to pick up all 
the money in the market by selling the product at the price each customer is willing to 
pay. This is called price discrimination—selling products to different people and groups 
based on their willingness to pay. If some people really want the product, sell it to them 
at a high price. But sell it to indifferent people at a much lower price; otherwise, they 
will not buy. This only works if the firm can (a) identify the price each individual would 
be willing to pay, and (b) segregate the customers from one another so they cannot find 
out what the others are paying. Therefore, most firms adopt a fixed price for their goods 
(P1), or a small number of prices for different versions of their products.
What if the marginal cost of producing a good is zero? What should the price be for 
these goods? It would be impossible then to set prices based on equalizing marginal 
revenue and marginal cost—because marginal cost is zero. The Internet is primarily 
filled with information goods—from music to research reports, to stock quotes, stories, 
weather reports, articles, pictures, and opinions—whose marginal cost of production 
is zero when distributed over the Internet. Thus, another reason certain goods, such

as some information goods, may be free on the Internet is that they are “selling” for 
what it costs to produce them—next to nothing. Content that is stolen has zero produc-
tion costs. Content that is contributed by users also has zero production costs for the 
websites themselves.
Free and Freemium  Everyone likes a bargain, and the best bargain is something for 
free. Businesses give away free PCs, free data storage, free music, free websites, free 
photo storage, and free Internet connections. Free is not new: banks used to give away 
“free” toasters to depositors in the 1950s. Google offers free office apps, free e-mail, 
and free collaboration sites. There can be a sensible economic logic to giving things 
away. Free content can help build market awareness and can lead to sales of other 
follow-on products. Finally, free products and services knock out potential and actual 
competitors (the free browser Internet Explorer from Microsoft spoiled the market for 
Netscape’s browser) (Shapiro and Varian, 1999).
Today, “free” is increasingly being implemented online as “freemium” to borrow 
a phrase from Chris Anderson’s book Free: The Future of a Radical Price. The freemium 
pricing model is a cross-subsidy online marketing strategy where users are offered a basic 
service for free, but must pay for premium or add-on services. The people who pay for 
the premium services hopefully will pay for all the free riders on the service. Skype uses 
a freemium model: millions of users can call other Skype users on the Internet for free, 
but there’s a charge for calling a land line or cell phone. Flickr, Google Sites, Yahoo, and a 
host of others offer premium services at a price in order to support free services. Pandora 
offers free Internet radio, but it includes advertisements. Premium service without ads 
costs about $55 a year. (See the Chapter 2 case study, Freemium Takes Pandora Public, for 
more information on Pandora and the freemium pricing strategy.)
“Free” and “freemium” as pricing strategies do have limits. In the past, many e-com-
merce businesses found it difficult to convert the eyeballs into paying customers. Free 
sites attract hundreds of millions of price-sensitive “freeloaders” who have no intention 
of ever paying for anything, and who switch from one free service to another at the very 
mention of charges. The piggyback strategy has not been a universal success. “Free” elimi-
nates a rich price discrimination strategy. Clearly some of the free loaders would indeed 
pay a small amount each month, and this revenue is lost to the firms who offer significant 
services for free. Some argue that everything digital will one day be free in part because 
Internet users expect it to be so. But the history of “free” includes broadcast television, 
which used to be “free” (it was advertising-supported), but the public eventually had no 
problem moving to cable television and DVDs as paid services. The exceptions to “free” 
are really valuable streams of information that are exclusive, expensive to produce, not 
widely distributed, unique, and have immediate consumption or investment value. Even 
in the age of the Internet, these digital streams will sell for a price greater than zero. 
There probably is no free lunch after all, at least not one that’s worth eating. 
Versioning  One solution to the problem of free information goods is versioning—cre-
ating multiple versions of the goods and selling essentially the same product to differ-
ent market segments at different prices. In this situation, the price depends on the 
value to the consumer. Consumers will segment themselves into groups that are 
willing to pay different amounts for various versions (Shapiro and Varian, 1998).

Versioning fits well with a modified “free” strategy. A reduced-value version can be 
offered for free, while premium versions can be offered at higher prices. What are 
characteristics of a “reduced-value version”? Low-priced—or in the case of informa-
tion goods, even “free”—versions might be less convenient to use, less comprehen-
sive, slower, less powerful, and offer less support than the high-priced versions. Just 
as there are different General Motors car brands appealing to different market seg-
ments (Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet, and GMC), and within these divisions, hundreds 
of models from the most basic to the more powerful and functional, so can informa-
tion goods be “versioned” in order to segment and target the market and position the 
products. In the realm of information goods, online magazines, music companies, 
and book publishers offer sample content for free, but charge for more powerful 
content. The New York Times, for instance, allows you to read 10 articles a month 
online for free, but if you want to read more, you must have a digital subscription. 
Some websites offer “free services” with annoying advertising, but turn off the ads 
for a monthly fee.
Bundling  “Ziggy” Ziegfeld, a vaudeville entrepreneur at the turn of the twentieth 
century in New York, noticed that nearly one-third of his theater seats were empty on 
some Friday nights, and during the week, matinee shows were often half empty. He 
came up with an idea for bundling tickets into “twofers”: pay for one full-price ticket 
and get the next ticket free. Twofers are still a Broadway theater tradition in New York. 
They are based on the idea that (a) the marginal cost of seating another patron is zero, 
and (b) a great many people who would not otherwise buy a single ticket would buy 
a “bundle” of tickets for the same or even a slightly higher price.
Bundling of information goods online extends the concept of a twofer. Bundling 
offers consumers two or more goods for a price that is less than the goods would cost 
when purchased individually. The key idea behind the concept of bundling is that 
although consumers typically have very diverse ideas about the value of a single 
product, they tend to agree much more on the value of a bundle of products offered 
at a fixed price. In fact, the per-product price people are willing to pay for the bundle 
is often higher than when the products are sold separately. Bundling reduces the 
variance (dispersion) in market demand for goods. 
Dynamic Pricing and Flash Marketing  The pricing strategies we have discussed so far 
are all fixed-price strategies. Versions and bundles are sold for fixed prices based on 
the firm’s best effort at maximizing its profits. But what if there is product still left on 
the shelf along with the knowledge that someone, somewhere, would be willing to pay 
something for it? It might be better to obtain at least some revenue from the product, 
rather than let it sit on the shelf, or even perish. Imagine also that there are some 
people in every market who would pay a hefty premium for a product if they could 
have it right away. In other situations, such as for an antique, the value of the product 
has to be discovered in the marketplace (usually because there is a belief that the 
marketplace would value the product at a much higher price than its owner paid as a 
cost). In other cases, the value of a good is equal to what the market is willing to pay 
(and has nothing to do with its cost). Or let’s say you want to build frequent visits to 
your site and offer some really great bargains for a few minutes each day, or the whole 
bundling
offers consumers two or 
more goods for a reduced 
price

day with a set time limit. Here is where dynamic pricing mechanisms come to the 
fore, and where the strengths of the Internet can be seen. With dynamic pricing, the 
price of the product varies, depending on the demand characteristics of the customer 
and the supply situation of the seller.
There are a number of different kinds of dynamic pricing mechanisms. For 
instance, auctions have been used for centuries to establish the instant market price 
for goods. Auctions are flexible and efficient market mechanisms for pricing unique 
or unusual goods, as well as commonplace goods such as computers, flower bundles, 
and cameras.
Yield management is quite different from auctions. In auctions, thousands of 
consumers establish a price by bidding against one another. In yield management, man-
agers set prices in different markets, appealing to different segments, in order to sell 
excess capacity. Airlines exemplify yield management techniques. Every few minutes 
during the day, they adjust prices of empty airline seats to ensure at least some of the 
50,000 empty airline seats are sold at some reasonable price—even below marginal 
cost of production. Amazon and other large online retailers frequently use yield man-
agement techniques that involve changing prices hourly to stimulate demand and 
maximize revenues. Amazon can also track shopping behavior of individuals seeking 
a specific product, such as a laser printer. As the consumer searches for the best price, 
Amazon can observe the offering prices on other websites, and then adjust its prices 
dynamically so that when the user visits Amazon again, a lower price will be displayed 
than all other sites visited. 
Yield management works under a limited set of conditions. Generally, the product 
is perishable (an empty airline seat perishes when the plane takes off without a full 
load); there are seasonal variations in demand; market segments are clearly defined; 
markets are competitive; and market conditions change rapidly (Cross, 1997). In 
general, only very large firms with extensive monitoring and database systems in 
place have been able to afford yield management techniques.
Surge pricing is a kind of dynamic pricing used by companies such as Uber. Uber 
uses a dynamic pricing algorithm to optimize its revenue, or as the company claims, to 
balance supply and demand. Prices have surged from two to ten times or higher during 
storms and popular holiday periods. Uber was sharply criticized for using this scheme 
in New York City during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Critics claim the practice amounts 
to price gouging, which during an emergency is illegal in some states like New York. 
Uber counters that the higher prices bring more livery cars onto the streets, increasing 
supply just when needed. But surge pricing, like most dynamic pricing schemes, is 
not the same as an open auction, where price movements are transparent to all. Uber 
does not make its data on supply and demand available to the public. Therefore it is 
impossible to know if Uber prices go up during holidays and storms because demand 
exceeds supply or because Uber wants to increase profits. In July 2014, Uber reached 
an agreement with the New York State Attorney General to limit pricing surges during 
emergencies (Isaac, 2014). 
A third dynamic pricing technique is flash marketing, which has proved extraordi-
narily effective for travel services, luxury clothing goods, and other goods. Using e-mail 
or dedicated website features to notify loyal customers (repeat purchasers), merchants 
dynamic pricing
the price of the product 
varies, depending on the 
demand characteristics of 
the customer and the 
supply situation of the 
seller

offer goods and services for a limited time (usually hours) at very low prices. JetBlue 
has offered $14 flights between New York and Los Angeles. Deluxe hotel rooms are 
flash marketed at $1 a night. Companies like Rue La La, HauteLook, and Gilt Groupe 
are based on flash marketing techniques. Blink and you can easily miss these great 
prices. Gilt purchases overstocked items from major fashion brands and then offers 
them to their subscribers at discounted prices via daily e-mail and SMS flash messages. 
Typically, the sale of an item lasts for two hours or until the inventory is depleted. 
On many occasions, Gilt rises to the top of most frequently visited websites when it 
conducts a sale. Critics point out that these sites take advantage of compulsive shop-
pers and lead to overshopping for unneeded goods. In another example of mass retail 
dynamic pricing, in 2011, Amazon used its new cloud music service to offer a flash 
one-day sale of Lady Gaga’s latest album for 99 cents. Response was so great that Ama-
zon’s cloud servers could not meet the demand, and the offer has not been repeated.
The Internet has truly revolutionized the possibilities to engage in dynamic, and 
even misleading, pricing strategies. With millions of consumers using a site every hour, 
and access to powerful databases, merchants can raise prices one minute and drop 
them another minute when a competitor threatens. Bait-and-switch tactics become 
more common: a really low price on one product is used to attract people to a site 
when in fact the product is not available.
Long Tail Marketing
Consider that Amazon sells a larger number of obscure books than it does of “hit” books 
(defined as the top 20% of books sold). Nevertheless, the hit books generate 80% of 
Amazon’s revenues. Consumers distribute themselves in many markets according to 
a power curve where 80% of the demand is for the hit products, and demand for 
nonhits quickly recedes to a small number of units sold. In a traditional market, niche 
products are so obscure no one ever hears about them. One impact of the Internet and 
e-commerce on sales of obscure products with little demand is that obscure products 
become more visible to consumers through search engines, recommendation engines, 
and social networks. Hence, online retailers can earn substantial revenue selling 
products for which demand and price are low. In fact, with near zero inventory costs, 
and a good search engine, the sales of obscure products can become a much larger 
percentage of total revenue. Amazon, for instance, has millions of book titles for sale 
at $2.99 or less, many written by obscure authors. Because of its search and recom-
mendation engines, Amazon is able to generate profits from the sale of this large 
number of obscure titles. This is called the long tail effect. See Insight on Technology: 
The Long Tail: Big Hits and Big Misses.
	 6.3 	 INTERNET MARKETING TECHNOLOGIES
Internet marketing has many similarities to and differences from ordinary market­
ing. The objective of Internet marketing—as in all marketing—is to build customer 
relationships so that the firm can achieve above-average returns (both by offering 
superior products or services and by communicating the product’s features to the

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
THE LONG TAIL: BIG HITS AND BIG MISSES
The Long Tail is a name given to 
various statistical distributions char-
acterized by a small group of events 
of high amplitude and a large group 
of events with low amplitude. Coined by 
Wired Magazine writer Chris Anderson in 
2004, the Web’s Long Tail has since gone on to 
fascinate academics and challenge online market-
ers. The concept is straightforward. Think Hol-
lywood movies: there are a few big hits and also 
thousands of films that no one ever hears about. 
It’s the legion of misses that make up the Long 
Tail. Anderson claimed to have discovered a new 
rule: no matter how much content you put online, 
someone, somewhere will show up to buy it, thanks 
to online search, social networks, and recommenda-
tion engines. For example, eBay contains millions 
of items drawn from every Aunt Tilly’s closet in the 
world and still seems to find a buyer somewhere for 
just about anything, generating revenue that would 
not be realized without an online marketplace.
On the Internet, where search costs are tiny 
and where companies aren’t forced to maintain a 
physical store, reducing storage and distribution 
costs, online retailers like Amazon and Alibaba offer 
millions of products for sale compared to a typical 
bricks-and-mortar retailer like Walmart or Sears. 
Wherever you look on the Web, you can find a great 
many items that only a few people are interested in 
buying. But with over 3.3 billion people online, even 
a one-in-a-million product could find over 3,000 
buyers. Researchers note that most shoppers have 
a taste for both popular as well as niche products.
One problem with the Long Tail is that people 
sometimes have difficulty finding niche products 
because they are—by definition—largely unknown. 
Here’s where recommender systems come into play: 
although these systems can skew toward the most 
popular selections, they can sometimes guide con-
sumers to obscure but wonderful works based on 
the recommendations of others. Netflix has spent 
millions on improving its recommender system, and 
Pandora’s recommender system focuses on generat-
ing quality music without regard to popularity.
Search engine optimization is another area 
where marketers are trying to unlock the power of 
the Long Tail. Long Tail keywords are phrases that 
a small but significant number of people might use 
to find products. For instance, instead of investing 
in keywords such as “shoes” or “men’s shoes,” 
which are dominated by bigger retailers, a marketer 
focused on the Long Tail might choose a keyword 
like “purple all-weather running shoes,” where his 
firm is much likelier to outrank its competition and 
achieve conversion rates over twice as high as more 
popular keywords and searches. Google has updated 
its search algorithms to improve the accuracy of 
Long Tail searches. According to Hitwise, Long 
Tail searches comprise as much as 70% of all Web 
queries, and Google claims that 15% of searches it 
receives each day have never been searched before. 
Google offers a feature called broad match, which 
allows a keyword to trigger an advertisement even 
when the search phrase is misspelled, contains 
synonyms, and so on, which further improves the 
results of Long Tail keywords in search. An increas-
ing number of Internet users are using natural lan-
guage searches (searches that are phrased in the way 
we would speak naturally, like “where is the nearest 
pizza place?”) to find products and services. Many 
of these searches are also part of the Long Tail. 
Social networks also make the Long Tail phe-
nomenon even stronger. A recent study found that 
popularity information of the sort produced in a 
social network spurs sales of niche products more 
than mainstream products because of the higher 
perceived quality of the niche product.
Anderson claimed that the Internet would 
revolutionize digital content by making even niche 
products highly profitable, and that the revenues

C H A P T E R  6     E - c o m m e r c e  M a r k e t i n g  a n d  A d v e r t i s i n g  C o n c e p t s
produced by small niche products would 
ultimately outweigh the revenues of hit 
movies, songs, and books. But newer research is 
mixed on the revenue potential in the Long Tail. 
Solid best sellers have expanded and produce the 
overwhelming majority of online media revenues. 
Despite fewer new subscribers than expected, Net-
flix’s most recent earnings report boasted record 
highs, which it credited to its growing group of 
original series and recently added blockbuster hits 
like the television series Friends, not the thousands 
of titles in its Long Tail. In fact, its DVD business, 
where most of its Long Tail titles are available, has 
only 4.5 million subscribers, compared to over 80 
million subscribers of its streaming service, which 
consists primarily of new original series and more 
popular movies and TV shows. The situation is 
similar in the music industry. As music services 
compete to offer increasingly large catalogs of 
songs, the well-known artists do better, while each 
individual member of the growing Long Tail finds 
it harder to stand out amidst lesser-known peers. 
On mobile devices especially, “front end display” 
for music services and e-books is smaller than on 
desktop screens, and only the superstars get this 
valuable marketing real estate.
On the other hand, up-and-coming artists have 
fewer barriers to entry and more avenues than ever 
to promote themselves without the aid of major 
labels. Artists like violinist Lindsey Stirling started 
out in the Long Tail, putting up videos on YouTube, 
and has since become a major commercial success. 
Other music companies are trying to replicate that 
success for Long Tail artists. Spotify has focused on 
improving the visibility of its Discovery Weekly and 
Fresh Finds features, which connect lesser known 
artists with wider audiences. In 2016, Kobalt, a 
music streaming site focused on independent artists, 
has partnered with multi-platform media company 
AwesomenessTV to highlight niche and undiscov-
ered artists. AwesomenessTV artists will be able 
to produce content for distribution on streaming 
services using Kobalt technology. And although 
Netflix may be driven primarily by blockbusters, 
it uses highly specific Long Tail categories such as 
“Imaginative Time Travel Movies from the 1980s” 
to narrow down exactly what its subscribers are 
interested in. One industry analysis found that even 
Amazon generates 57% of its sales from Long Tail 
keywords that didn’t fall into any “popular” search; 
on Long Tail Google searches, Amazon results 
usually rank within the top two or three results. 
Both the Long Tail and the winner-take-all 
approaches have implications for marketers and 
product designers. In the Long Tail approach, 
online merchants, especially those selling digital 
goods such as content, should build up huge librar-
ies of content because they can make significant 
revenues from niche products that have small audi-
ences. In the winner-take-all approach, the niche 
products produce little revenue, and firms should 
concentrate on hugely popular titles and services.

consumer). But Internet marketing is also very different from ordinary marketing 
because the nature of the medium and its capabilities are so different from anything 
that has come before. In order to understand just how different Internet marketing 
can be and in what ways, you first need to become familiar with some basic Internet 
marketing technologies.
THE REVOLUTION IN INTERNET MARKETING TECHNOLOGIES
In Chapter 1, we listed eight unique features of e-commerce technology. Table 6.6 
describes how marketing has changed as a result of these new technical capabilities.

Ubiquity 
Marketing communications have been extended to the home, work, and 
mobile platforms; geographic limits on marketing have been reduced. The 
marketplace has been replaced by “marketspace” and is removed from a 
temporal and geographic location. Customer convenience has been enhanced, 
and shopping costs have been reduced.
Global reach 
Worldwide customer service and marketing communications have been 
enabled. Potentially hundreds of millions of consumers can be reached with 
marketing messages.
Universal standards 
The cost of delivering marketing messages and receiving feedback from users 
is reduced because of shared, global standards of the Internet.
Richness 
Video, audio, and text marketing messages can be integrated into a single 
marketing message and consuming experience.
Interactivity
Consumers can be engaged in a dialog, dynamically adjusting the experience 
to the consumer, and making the consumer a co-producer of the goods and 
services being sold.
Information density 
Fine-grained, highly detailed information on consumers’ real-time behavior can be 
gathered and analyzed for the first time. “Data mining” Internet technology 
permits the analysis of terabytes of consumer data every day for marketing 
purposes.
Personalization/
Customization
This feature potentially enables product and service differentiation down to the 
level of the individual, thus strengthening the ability of marketers to create 
brands.
Social technology
User-generated content and social network sites, along with blogs, have created 
large new audiences online, where the content is provided by users. These 
audiences have greatly expanded the opportunity for marketers to reach new 
potential customers in a nontraditional media format. Entirely new kinds of 
marketing techniques are evolving. These same technologies expose marketers 
to the risk of falling afoul of popular opinion by providing more market power to 
users who now can “talk back.”

On balance, the Internet has had four very powerful impacts on marketing. First, 
the Internet, as a communications medium, has broadened the scope of marketing 
communications—in the sense of the number of people who can be easily reached as 
well as the locations where they can be reached, from desktops to mobile smartphones 
(in short, everywhere). Second, the Internet has increased the richness of marketing 
communications by combining text, video, and audio content into rich messages. 
Arguably, the Web is richer as a medium than even television or video because of the 
complexity of messages available, the enormous content accessible on a wide range 
of subjects, and the ability of users to interactively control the experience. Third, the 
Internet has greatly expanded the information intensity of the marketplace by provid-
ing marketers (and customers) with unparalleled fine-grained, detailed, real-time infor-
mation about consumers as they transact in the marketplace. Fourth, the always-on, 
always-attached, environment created by mobile devices results in consumers being 
much more available to receive marketing messages. One result is an extraordinary 
expansion in marketing opportunities for firms.
WEB TRANSACTION LOGS
How can e-commerce sites know more than a department store or the local grocery 
store does about consumer behavior? A primary source of consumer information on 
the Web is the transaction log maintained by all web servers. A transaction log records 
user activity at a website. The transaction log is built into web server software. Transac-
tion log data becomes even more useful when combined with two other visitor-gen-
erated data trails: registration forms and the shopping cart database. Users are enticed 
through various means (such as free gifts or special services) to fill out registration 
forms. Registration forms gather personal data on name, address, phone, zip code, 
e-mail address (usually required), and other optional self-confessed information on 
interests and tastes. When users make a purchase, they also enter additional informa-
tion into the shopping cart database. The shopping cart database captures all the 
item selection, purchase, and payment data. Other potential additional sources of data 
are information users submit on product forms, contribute to chat groups, or send via 
e-mail messages using the “Contact Us” option on most sites.
For a website that has a million visitors per month, and where, on average, a 
visitor makes 15 page requests per visit, there will be 15 million entries in the log 
each month. These transaction logs, coupled with data from the registration forms 
and shopping cart database, represent a treasure trove of marketing information for 
both individual sites and the online industry as a whole. Nearly all Internet marketing 
capabilities are based on these data-gathering tools. For instance, here are just a few 
of the interesting marketing questions that can be answered by examining a site’s web 
transaction logs, registration forms, and shopping cart database:
•	 What are the major patterns of interest and purchase for groups and individuals?
•	 After the home page, where do most users go first, and then second and third?
•	 What are the interests of specific individuals (those we can identify)?
•	 How can we make it easier for people to use our site so they can find what they want?

•	 How can we change the design of the site to encourage visitors to purchase our 
high-margin products?
•	 Where are visitors coming from (and how can we optimize our presence on these 
referral sites)?
•	 How can we personalize our messages, offerings, and products to individual users?
Businesses can choke on the massive quantity of information found in a typical 
site’s log file. We describe some technologies that help firms more effectively utilize 
this information below.
SUPPLEMENTING THE LOGS: COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING FILES
While transaction logs create the foundation of online data collection at a single 
website, marketers use tracking files to follow users across the Web as they visit other 
sites. There are three primary kinds of tracking files: cookies, Flash cookies, and 
web beacons. A cookie is a small text file that websites place on the hard disk of 
visitors’ client computers every time they visit, and during the visit, as specific pages 
are visited. Cookies allow a website to store data on a user’s computer and then later 
retrieve it. The cookie typically includes a name, a unique ID number for each visitor 
that is stored on the user’s computer, the domain (which specifies the web server/
domain that can access the cookie), a path (if a cookie comes from a particular part 
of a website instead of the main page, a path will be given), a security setting that 
provides whether the cookie can only be transmitted by a secure server, and an 
expiration date (not required). First-party cookies come from the same domain name 
as the page the user is visiting, while third-party cookies come from another domain, 
such as ad serving or adware companies, affiliate marketers, or spyware servers. On 
some websites, there are literally hundreds of tracking files on the main pages. 
A cookie provides web marketers with a very quick means of identifying the 
customer and understanding his or her prior behavior at the site. Websites use cookies 
to determine how many people are visiting the site, whether they are new or repeat 
visitors, and how often they have visited, although this data may be somewhat inac-
curate because people share computers, they often use more than one computer, and 
cookies may have been inadvertently or intentionally erased. Cookies make shopping 
carts and “quick checkout” options possible by allowing a site to keep track of a user 
as he or she adds to the shopping cart. Each item added to the shopping cart is stored 
in the site’s database along with the visitor’s unique ID value.
Ordinary cookies are easy to spot using your browser, but Flash cookies, beacons, 
and tracking codes are not easily visible. All common browsers allow users to see the 
cookies placed in their cookies file. Users can delete cookies, or adjust their settings 
so that third-party cookies are blocked, while first-party cookies are allowed.
With growing privacy concerns, over time the percentage of people deleting 
cookies has risen. The more cookies are deleted, the less accurate are web page and 
ad server metrics, and the less likely marketers will be able to understand who is 
visiting their sites or where they came from. As a result, advertisers have sought 
other methods. One way is using Adobe Flash software, which creates its own cookie

visitors’ client computers

files, known as Flash cookies. Flash cookies can be set to never expire, and can store 
about 5 MB of information compared to the 1,024 bytes stored by regular cookies. 
Although cookies are site-specific (a website can only receive the data it has 
stored on a client computer and cannot look at any other cookie), when combined 
with web beacons (also called “bugs”), they can be used to create cross-site profiles. 
Web beacons are tiny (1-pixel) graphic files embedded in e-mail messages and on 
websites. Web beacons are used to automatically transmit information about the user 
and the page being viewed to a monitoring server in order to collect personal brows-
ing behavior and other personal information. For instance, when a recipient opens an 
e-mail in HTML format or opens a web page, a message is sent to a server calling for 
graphic information. This tells the marketer that the e-mail was opened, indicating 
that the recipient was at least interested in the subject header. Web beacons are not 
visible to users. They are often clear or colored white so they are not visible to the 
recipient. You may be able to determine if a web page is using web beacons by using 
the View Source option of your browser and examining the IMG (image) tags on the 
page. As noted above, web beacons are typically one pixel in size and contain the 
URL of a server that differs from the one that served the page itself. 
Using cookies on mobile devices has been less effective. Regular cookies on the 
mobile Web are reset every time a user closes his or her mobile browser and in-app 
cookies can’t be shared between apps, making both of limited utility. However, 
with the increasing numbers of people using mobile devices to access the Internet, 
it is not surprising that telecommunications companies have begun to use tracking 
files. In late 2014, it was revealed that Verizon Wireless and AT&T were inserting 
a tracking header called a Unique Identifier Header (UIDH) into HTTP requests 
issued to websites from mobile devices, enabling them to track the online activities 
of their subscribers. Commentators call these tracking headers zombie cookies, 
perma-cookies, or supercookies because they cannot be deleted the way that regular 
browser cookies can. Following an outcry by privacy advocates and an FCC inves-
tigation, AT&T reportedly stopped using supercookies, and in March 2016, Verizon 
settled with the FCC, agreeing to pay a $1.35 million fine, and to obtain customer 
permission before sharing tracking data with other companies and even with other 
parts of Verizon, including sites owned by AOL. In addition, Verizon agreed to inform 
customers about its ad targeting practices in the first instance. The FCC also consid-
ering whether to outlaw the use of supercookies entirely. 
In an effort to more effectively track consumers across devices, other cross-
device tracking methods have begun to be developed. Deterministic cross-device 
tracking relies on personally identifiable information such as e-mail address used 
to log into an app and website on different devices. Facebook, Google, Apple, Twitter, 
and other companies that have very large user bases and have both desktop and 
mobile properties that require logins are the most likely to be able to effectively 
exploit deterministic matching. Probabilistic cross-device tracking uses algorithms 
developed by vendors such as Drawbridge, BlueCava, and Tapad to analyze thousands 
of anonymous data points, such as device type, operating system, and IP address, to 
create a possible match. This type of matching is, not surprisingly, less accurate than 
deterministic matching (Schiff, 2015; Whitener, 2015).

In November 2015, the Federal Trade Commission hosted a workshop to examine 
the privacy issues involved with cross-device tracking, and in January 2016, urged 
the ad industry to allow consumers to opt out of such tracking, noting that consum-
ers’ increased use of ad blocking indicates their displeasure with the current state 
of online advertising. In response, the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) has issued 
guidance that makes clear that the transparency and choice obligations of its exist-
ing Self-Regulatory Principles also apply to cross-device tracking. Insight on Society: 
Every Move You Take, Every Click You Make, We’ll Be Tracking You further examines 
the use of tracking files.
DATABASES, DATA WAREHOUSES, DATA MINING, AND BIG DATA
Databases, data warehouses, data mining, and the variety of marketing decision-making 
techniques loosely called profiling are at the heart of the revolution in Internet market-
ing. Profiling uses a variety of tools to create a digital image for each consumer. This 
image can be quite inexact, even primitive, but it can also be as detailed as a character 
in a novel. The quality of a consumer profile depends on the amount of data used to 
create it, and the analytical power of the firm’s software and hardware. Together, these 
techniques attempt to identify precisely who the online customer is and what they want, 
and then, to fulfill the customer’s criteria exactly. These techniques are more powerful, 
far more precise, and more fine-grained than the gross levels of demographic and market 
segmentation techniques used in mass marketing media or by telemarketing.
In order to understand the data in transaction logs, registration forms, shopping 
carts, cookies, web bugs, and other unstructured data sources like e-mails, tweets, and 
Facebook Likes, Internet marketers need massively powerful and capacious databases, 
database management systems, and analytic tools. 
Databases
The first step in interpreting huge transaction streams is to store the information 
systematically. A database is a software application that stores records and attributes. 
A telephone book is a physical database that stores records of individuals and their 
attributes such as names, addresses, and phone numbers. A database management 
system (DBMS) is a software application used by organizations to create, maintain, 
and access databases. The most common DBMS are DB2 from IBM and a variety of 
SQL databases from Oracle, Sybase, and other providers. Structured query language 
(SQL) is an industry-standard database query and manipulation language used in 
relational databases. Relational databases such as DB2 and SQL represent data as 
two-dimensional tables with records organized in rows, and attributes in columns, 
much like a spreadsheet. The tables—and all the data in them—can be flexibly related 
to one another as long as the tables share a common data element.
Relational databases are extraordinarily flexible and allow marketers and other 
managers to view and analyze data from different perspectives very quickly. 
Data Warehouses and Data Mining

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
EVERY MOVE YOU TAKE, EVERY CLICK YOU 
MAKE, WE’LL BE TRACKING YOU 
Advertising-supported websites 
depend on knowing as much personal 
information as possible about you. One 
of the main ways ad firms discover your 
personal information is by placing so-called 
“tracking files” on your computer’s browser. There 
are several kinds of third-party tracking files on 
web pages. Cookies are the best known. These 
simple text files are placed in your browser and 
assign a unique number to your computer, which 
is then used by advertisers to track you across 
the Web as you move from one site to another 
(without telling you). Web beacons (sometimes 
also referred to as web bugs) are a little more 
pernicious. Beacons are small software files that 
track your clicks, choices, purchases, and even 
location data from mobile devices, and then send 
that information, often in real time, to advertisers 
tracking you. Beacons can also assign your com-
puter a unique number and track you across the 
Web. Tracking may also occur as you watch Adobe 
Flash-enabled videos, visit websites equipped with 
HTML5 local storage, and use apps on smart-
phones. Most Facebook apps, for instance, send 
personal information, including names, to dozens 
of advertising and Internet tracking companies. 
A number of telecommunications companies use 
supercookies, which are updated whenever a user 
accesses a website with a mobile device. Mobile 
service carriers then provide those sites with addi-
tional information about the user for a cost.
So how common is web and mobile track-
ing? In a recent study, researchers found a very 
widespread surveillance system. Only one site, 
Wikipedia, had no tracking files. Two-thirds of the 
tracking files came from companies whose primary 
business is identifying and tracking Internet users 
to create consumer profiles that can be sold to 
advertising firms looking for specific types of cus-
tomers. The other third came from database firms 
that gather and bundle the information and then 
sell it to marketers. Many of the tracking tools 
gather personal information such as age, gender, 
race, income, marital status, health concerns, TV 
shows and movies viewed, magazines and newspa-
pers read, and books purchased. While tracking 
firms claim the information they gather is anony-
mous, this is true in name only. Scholars have 
shown that with just a few pieces of information, 
such as age, gender, zip code, and marital status, 
specific individuals can be easily identified. A 2015 
Web Privacy Census conducted by the University 
of California Berkeley Center for Law and Technol-
ogy found that the total number of cookies on the 
home pages of top 100 websites had increased by 
80%, from 3,600 when first measured in 2009 to 
almost 6,300. The vast majority of these cookies 
(about 85%) were third-party tracking cookies, 
from 275 different third-party hosts. Cookies 
orginating from Google’s tracking infrastructure 
(including Google Analytics, DoubleClick, and 
YouTube) appeared on over 90% of both the top 
100 and top 1000 websites, which the authors 
noted provides Google with a significant online 
surveillance structure. Similar results were 
observed when looking at the top 25,000 websites. 
The Privacy Foundation has issued guidelines 
for web beacon usage. The guidelines suggest that 
web beacons should be visible as an icon on the 
screen, the icon should be labeled to indicate its 
function, and it should identify the name of the 
company that placed the web beacon on the page. 
In addition, if a user clicks on the web beacon, it 
should display a disclosure statement indicating 
what data is being collected, how the data is used 
after it is collected, what companies receive the 

	
I n t e r n e t  M a r k e t i n g  T e c h n o l o g i e s 	

395
data, what other data the web beacon is combined 
with, and whether or not a cookie is associated 
with the web beacon. Users should be able to opt 
out of any data collection done by the web beacon, 
and the web beacon should not be used to collect 
information from web pages of a sensitive nature, 
such as medical, financial, job-related, or sexual 
matters. None of these ideas are found in current 
law. In 2014, California drafted guidelines for 
websites to disclose all of their privacy practices, 
but these guidelines are voluntary and attempts 
to create stricter standards on both the federal 
and state level have been unsuccessful. Many sites 
have adopted the Network Advertising Initiative 
(NAI)’s self-regulatory guidelines, but these too 
are only voluntary, and these guidelines have done 
little to assuage fears from web users that their 
privacy is at risk.
One roadblock involves the meaning of Do 
Not Track (DNT). The W3C has been working on a 
specification with respect to DNT since 2011, but 
as of 2016, it still remains in draft format. Govern-
ment and privacy groups have pushed for a DNT 
feature that would require users to affirmatively 
allow tracking. The advertising industry, not surpris-
ingly, favors a form of DNT that requires users to 
affirmatively implement DNT. Nearly all browsers 
now offer users the option of using a DNT feature, 
although users have to remember to turn it on. The 
FCC has refused to make DNT mandatory, and as a 
result, websites often ignore DNT requests because 
it is more profitable for them to do so, with adver-
tisers willing to pay up to seven times more for a 
highly targeted ad. In 2014, major companies such 
as Yahoo and AOL abandoned the DNT 
standard, citing the lack of traction that DNT 
has encountered across the rest of the Web. 
Although some bigger websites like Twitter and 
Pinterest do follow DNT guidelines, these promi-
nent defections are setbacks for the standard. Some 
users have turned instead to ad-blocking browser 
plug-ins such as AdBlock and Disconnect to avoid 
ads entirely. This has put additional pressure on 
websites as the pool of web users that advertisers 
can reach slowly shrinks. 
Major websites and the online advertising 
industry insist their industry can self-regulate 
and preserve individual privacy, but evidence 
suggests intervention from a neutral party will 
be necessary. In 2015, the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation (EFF), a prominent privacy advocacy 
group, announced a DNT coalition, that allows 
content publishers and other sites in compliance 
with DNT to prominently display the EFF’s “seal 
of approval,” along with options that allow users 
to disable ad-blocking software on these sites, 
enabling them to see ads without being tracked. 
Social blogging platform Medium and online 
analytics firm Mixpanel have also pledged not to 
track users who have enabled DNT, but convincing 
Google, Facebook, and other industry giants whose 
revenues depend heavily on web tracking is more 
difficult, and thus far, no advertising firms have 
agreed to the new proposal. As usual, the EFF’s 
new plan is completely voluntary, with minimal 
legislative backing behind it. Until governments 
weigh in, web users will have to be wary of where 
they go and what they share online.

originate in many core operational areas of the firm, such as website transaction logs, 
shopping carts, point-of-sale terminals (product scanners) in stores, warehouse inven-
tory levels, field sales reports, external scanner data supplied by third parties, and 
financial payment data. The purpose of a data warehouse is to gather all the firm’s 
transaction and customer data into one logical repository where it can be analyzed 
and modeled by managers without disrupting or taxing the firm’s primary transactional 
systems and databases. Data warehouses grow quickly into storage repositories contain-
ing terabytes (trillions of bytes) of data on consumer behavior at a firm’s stores and 
websites. With a data warehouse, firms can answer such questions as: What products 
are the most profitable by region and city? What regional marketing campaigns are 
working? How effective is store promotion of the firm’s website? Data warehouses can 
provide business managers with a more complete awareness of customers through 
data that can be accessed quickly.
Data mining is a set of analytical techniques that look for patterns in the data of a 
database or data warehouse, or seek to model the behavior of customers. Website data 
can be “mined” to develop profiles of visitors and customers. A customer profile is 
simply a set of rules that describe the typical behavior of a customer or a group of 
customers at a website. Customer profiles help to identify the patterns in group and 
individual behavior that occur online as millions of visitors use a firm’s website. For 
example, almost every financial transaction you engage in is processed by a data mining 
application to detect fraud. Phone companies closely monitor your cell phone use as 
well to detect stolen phones and unusual calling patterns. Financial institutions and cell 
phone firms use data mining to develop fraud profiles. When a user’s behavior conforms 
to a fraud profile, the transaction is not allowed or is terminated (Mobasher, 2007).
There are many different types of data mining. The simplest type is query-driven 
data mining, which is based on specific queries. For instance, based on hunches of 
marketers who suspect a relationship in the database or who need to answer a specific 
question, such as “What is the relationship between time of day and purchases of 
various products at the website?”, marketers can easily query the data warehouse and 
produce a database table that rank-orders the top 10 products sold at a website by each 
hour of the day. Marketers can then change the content of the website to stimulate 
more sales by highlighting different products over time or placing particular products 
on the home page at certain times of day or night.
Another form of data mining is model-driven. Model-driven data mining involves 
the use of a model that analyzes the key variables of interest to decision makers. For 
example, marketers may want to reduce the inventory carried on the website by remov-
ing unprofitable items that do not sell well. A financial model can be built showing the 
profitability of each product on the site so that an informed decision can be made.
A more fine-grained behavioral approach that seeks to deal with individuals as 
opposed to market segments derives rules from individual consumer behavior (along 
with some demographic information) (Adomavicius and Tuzhilin, 2001a; Chan, 1999; 
Fawcett and Provost, 1996, 1997). Here, the pages actually visited by specific users 
are stored as a set of conjunctive rules. For example, if an individual visits a site and 
typically (“as a rule”) moves from the home page to the financial news section to the 
Asian report section, and then often purchases articles from the “Recent Developments

in Banking” section, this person—based on purely past behavioral patterns—might 
be shown an advertisement for a book on Asian money markets. These rules can be 
constructed to follow an individual across many different websites.
There are many drawbacks to all these techniques, not least of which is that there 
may be millions of rules, many of them nonsensical, and many others of short-term dura-
tion. Hence, the rules need extensive validation and culling (Adomavicius and Tuzhilin, 
2001b). Also, there can be millions of affinity groups and other patterns in the data that 
are temporal or meaningless. The difficulty is isolating the valid, powerful (profitable) 
patterns in the data and then acting on the observed pattern fast enough to make a sale 
that otherwise would not have been made. As we see later, there are practical difficulties 
and trade-offs involved in achieving these levels of granularity, precision, and speed.
Hadoop and the Challenge of Big Data 
Until recently, most data collected by organizations consisted of structured transaction 
data that could easily fit into rows and columns of relational database management 
systems. Since then, there has been an explosion of data from web traffic, e-mail mes-
sages, social media content (tweets, status messages), even music play­lists, as well as 
machine-generated data from sensors that, due to the plummeting cost of data storage 
and powerful new processing capabilities, can now be stored and analyzed to draw 
connections and make inferences and predictions. This data may be unstructured or 
semi-structured and thus not suitable for relational database products that organize data 
in the form of columns and rows. The term big data refers to this avalanche of digital 
data that creates huge data sets, often from different sources, in the petabyte and 
exabyte range. The volumes of data are so large that traditional DBMS cannot capture, 
store, and analyze the data in a reasonable time. Some examples of big data challenges 
are analyzing 8 terabytes of tweets generated by Twitter each day to improve your 
understanding of consumer sentiment towards your products; 100 million e-mails in 
order to place appropriate ads alongside the e-mail messages; or 500 million call detail 
records to find patterns of fraud and churn. According to the IDC technology research 
firm, data is more than doubling every two years, so the amount of data available to 
organizations is skyrocketing. The next frontier will be data derived from the Internet 
of Things (IoT). 
Marketers are interested in big data because it allows them to link huge amounts of 
data from a variety of different sources, which in the past they were unable to do, and 
mine it for patterns of consumer behavior, with the potential to provide new insights 
into customer behavior, financial market activity, or other phenomena. For instance, 
Evrythng, an IoT platform company, has partnered with Trueffect, a digital ad firm, to 
develop ways that marketers can use data generated by connected appliances and other 
devices in order to directly communicate with and target advertising with consumers. 
However, to derive business value from this data, organizations need new technologies 
and analytic tools capable of managing and analyzing nontraditional data along with their 
traditional enterprise data. A recent survey found that while marketers say big data is 
their biggest opportunity, only 14% are confident in their use of big data (Tadena, 2015).
To handle unstructured and semi-structured data in vast quantities, as well as struc-
tured data, organizations are using Hadoop. Hadoop is an open source software frame-

work managed by the Apache Software Foundation that enables distributed parallel 
processing of huge amounts of data across inexpensive computers. It breaks a big data 
problem down into subproblems, distributes them among up to thousands of inexpensive 
computer processing nodes, and then combines the result into a smaller data set that is 
easier to analyze. You’ve probably used Hadoop to find the best airfare on the Internet, 
get directions to a restaurant, search on Google, or connect with a friend on Facebook. 
Hadoop can process large quantities of any kind of data, including structured 
transactional data, loosely structured data such as Facebook and Twitter feeds, complex 
data such as web server log files, and unstructured audio and video data. Hadoop 
runs on a cluster of inexpensive servers, and processors can be added or removed as 
needed. Companies use Hadoop to analyze very large volumes of data as well as for a 
staging area for unstructured and semi-structured data before it is loaded into a data 
warehouse. Facebook stores much of its data on its massive Hadoop cluster, which holds 
an estimated 300 petabytes, about 30,000 times more information than the Library of 
Congress. Yahoo uses Hadoop to track user behavior so it can modify its home page to 
fit user interests. Life sciences research firm NextBio uses Hadoop and HBase to process 
data for pharmaceutical companies conducting genomic research. Top database vendors 
such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Oracle, and Microsoft have their own Hadoop software 
distributions. Other vendors offer tools for moving data into and out of Hadoop or for 
analyzing data within Hadoop. In addition, there are many new tools being developed 
for big data analysis in addition to Hadoop. One example is Spark, an open source 
product being supported by IBM that can deliver results faster than Hadoop.
MARKETING AUTOMATION AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT 
(CRM) SYSTEMS
Marketing automation systems are software tools that marketers use to track all the 
steps in the lead generation part of the marketing process. The marketing process 
begins with making the potential customer aware of the firm and product, and recog-
nizing the need for the product. This is the beginning of a lead—someone who might 
buy. From there, consumers need to find you as they search for products; they will 
compare your products with your competitors’ offerings and at some point, choose to 
purchase. Software can help in each of these stages of the marketing process. A 
number of firms sell software packages that can visualize most of the online marketing 
activities of a firm and then track the progression from exposure to display ads, finding 
your firm on a search engine, directing follow-up e-mail and communications, and 
finally a purchase. Once leads become customers, customer relationship management 
systems take over the maintenance of the relationship. 
Customer relationship management systems are another important Internet mar-
keting technology. A customer relationship management (CRM) system is a 
repository of customer information that records all of the contacts that a customer has 
with a firm (including websites) and generates a customer profile available to everyone 
in the firm with a need to “know the customer.” CRM systems also supply the analyti-
cal software required to analyze and use customer information. Customers come to 
firms not just over the Web but also through telephone call centers, customer service 
representatives, sales representatives, automated voice response systems, ATMs and 
kiosks, in-store point-of-sale terminals, and mobile devices (m-commerce).

Collectively, these are referred to as “customer touchpoints.” In the past, firms 
generally did not maintain a single repository of customer information, but instead 
were organized along product lines, with each product line maintaining a customer 
list (and often not sharing it with others in the same firm).
In general, firms did not know who their customers were, how profitable they 
were, or how they responded to marketing campaigns. For instance, a bank customer 
might see a television advertisement for a low-cost auto loan that included an 800-
number to call. However, if the customer came to the bank’s website instead, rather 
than calling the 800-number, marketers would have no idea how effective the televi-
sion campaign was because this web customer contact data was not related to the 
800-number call center data. Figure 6.10 illustrates how a CRM system integrates 
customer contact data into a single system.
CRMs are part of the evolution of firms toward a customer-centric and marketing-
segment–based business, and away from a product-line–centered business. CRMs

the ways in which 
customers interact with the 
firm

A CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This is an example of a CRM system. The system captures customer information from all customer touchpoints as well 
as other data sources, merges the data, and aggregates it into a single customer data repository or data warehouse 
where it can be used to provide better service, as well as to construct customer profiles for marketing purposes. Online 
analytical processing (OLAP) allows managers to dynamically analyze customer activities to spot trends or problems 
involving customers. Other analytical software programs analyze aggregate customer behavior to identify profitable 
and unprofitable customers as well as customer activities.

are essentially a database technology with extraordinary capabilities for addressing 
the needs of each customer and differentiating the product or service on the basis of 
treating each customer as a unique person. Customer profiles can contain the follow-
ing information:
•	 A map of the customer’s relationship with the institution
•	 Product and usage summary data
•	 Demographic and psychographic data
•	 Profitability measures
•	 Contact history summarizing the customer’s contacts with the institution across 
most delivery channels
•	 Marketing and sales information containing programs received by the customer 
and the customer’s responses
•	 E-mail campaign responses
•	 Website visits
•	 Mobile app downloads
With these profiles, CRMs can be used to sell additional products and services, 
develop new products, increase product utilization, reduce marketing costs, identify 
and retain profitable customers, optimize service delivery costs, retain high lifetime 
value customers, enable personal communications, improve customer loyalty, and 
increase product profitability. The goal is what is known as a “360-degree” view that 
enables a company to know what its customers buy, how they browse, what kinds of 
communications and offers will engage them, and more. Leading CRM vendors include 
Oracle, SAP, Microsoft, Salesforce, and SugarCRM, many of which offer cloud-based 
versions of their CRM products. One issue facing cloud CRM providers and global 
companies that use those products is European Union data regulations that will require 
them to reassess how they use CRM data in order to avoid violating those regulations. 
All the major vendors offer cloud-based SaaS CRM applications.

UNDERSTANDING THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF 
ONLINE MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS
As we noted earlier, online marketing communications still comprise only a small 
part of the total marketing communications universe. While there are several reasons 
why this is the case, two of the main ones are concerns about how well online adver-
tising really works and about how to adequately measure the costs and benefits of 
online advertising. We will address both of these topics in this section. But first, we 
will define some important terms used when examining the effectiveness of online 
marketing.
ONLINE MARKETING METRICS: LEXICON
In order to understand the process of attracting prospects via marketing communica-
tions and converting them into customers, you will need to be familiar with online 

marketing terminology. Table 6.7 lists some terms commonly used to describe the 
impacts and results of “traditional” online marketing such as display ads and e-mail 
campaigns. Metrics for social, mobile, and local marketing are covered in Chapter 7.
The first nine metrics focus primarily on the success of a website in achieving 
audience or market share by “driving” shoppers to the site. These measures often 
substitute for solid information on sales revenue as e-commerce entrepreneurs seek 
to have investors and the public focus on the success of the website in “attracting 
eyeballs” (viewers).
Impressions are the number of times an ad is served. Click-through rate (CTR) 
measures the percentage of people exposed to an online advertisement who actually 
click on the advertisement. Because not all ads lead to an immediate click, the indus-
try has invented a term for a long-term hit called view-through rate (VTR), which 
measures the 30-day response rate to an ad. Hits are the number of HTTP requests 
received by a firm’s server. Hits can be misleading as a measure of website activity 
because a “hit” does not equal a page. A single page may account for several hits if 
the page contains multiple images or graphics. A single website visitor can generate 
hundreds of hits. For this reason, hits are not an accurate representation of web traffic 
or visits, even though they are generally easy to measure; the sheer volume of hits can 
be huge—and sound impressive—but not be a true measure of activity. Page views 
are the number of pages requested by visitors. However, with increased usage of web 
frames that divide pages into separate sections, a single page that has three frames will 
generate three page views. Hence, page views per se are also not a very useful metric.
Viewability rate is the percentage of ads (either display or video) that are actually 
seen by people online. See page 365 for a further discussion of the issue of viewability.
The number of unique visitors is perhaps the most widely used measure of a 
website’s popularity. The measurement of unique visitors counts the number of 
distinct, unique visitors to a website, regardless of how many pages they view. Loyalty 
measures the percentage of visitors who return in a year. This can be a good indicator 
of a site’s web following, and perhaps the trust shoppers place in a site. Reach is typi-
cally a percentage of the total number of consumers in a market who visit a website; 
for example, 10% of all book purchasers in a year will visit Amazon at least once to 
shop for a book. This provides an idea of the power of a website to attract market share. 
Recency—like loyalty—measures the power of a website to produce repeat visits and 
is generally measured as the average number of days elapsed between shopper or 
customer visits. For example, a recency value of 25 days means the average customer 
will return once every 25 days.
Stickiness (sometimes called duration) is the average length of time visitors 
remain at a website. Stickiness is important to marketers because the longer the 
amount of time a visitor spends at a website, the greater the probability of a pur-
chase. However, equally important is what people do when they visit a website and 
not just how much time they spend there. 
The metrics described so far do not say much about commercial activity nor help 
you understand the conversion from visitor to customer. Several other measures are 
more helpful in this regard. Acquisition rate measures the percentage of visitors who 
register or visit product pages (indicating interest in the product). Conversion rate 
measures the percentage of visitors who actually purchase something. Conversion

rates can vary widely, depending on the success of the site. The average conversion 
rate in the United States for e-commerce sites on traditional desktop computers was 
about 4.25% in the first half of 2016, compared to about 3.45% for tablet computers 
and 1.35% for smartphones. Clearly, websites viewed on desktops still remain the 
most effective vehicle for converting visitors into purchasers (Monetate, 2016). The 
browse-to-buy ratio measures the ratio of items purchased to product views. The 
view-to-cart ratio calculates the ratio of “Add to cart” clicks to product views. Cart 
conversion rate measures the ratio of actual orders to “Add to cart” clicks. Checkout 
conversion rate calculates the ratio of actual orders to checkouts started. Abandon-
ment rate measures the percentage of shoppers who begin a shopping cart form but 
then fail to complete the form and leave the website. Abandonment rates can signal 
a number of potential problems—poor form design, lack of consumer trust, or con-
sumer purchase uncertainty caused by other factors. Recent studies on shopping cart 
abandonment found abandonment rates ranging from 68% to 75% (Baymard Institute, 
2016). Among the reasons for abandonment were security concerns, customer just 
checking prices, couldn’t find customer support, couldn’t find preferred payment 
option, and the item being unavailable at checkout. Given that more than 80% of 
online shoppers generally have a purchase in mind when they visit a website, a high 
abandonment rate signals many lost sales. Retention rate indicates the percentage of 
existing customers who continue to buy on a regular basis. Attrition rate measures 
the percentage of customers who purchase once but never return within a year (the 
opposite of loyalty and retention rates).
Specific types of advertising have their own special metrics. For instance, for video 
ads, view time (how long the ad actually stays in view while it plays) and completion 
rate (how many viewers watch the entire video ad) are important factors. Research has 
shown that brand recall is significantly higher when the entire ad is watched, making 
the completion rate metric more meaningful to advertisers than the click-through 
rate (Adler, 2015).
E-mail campaigns also have their own set of metrics. Open rate measures the 
percentage of customers who open the e-mail and are exposed to the message. Gener-
ally, open rates are quite high, in the area of 50% or greater. However, some browsers 
open mail as soon as the mouse cursor moves over the subject line, and therefore 
this measure can be difficult to interpret. Delivery rate measures the percentage of 
e-mail recipients who received the e-mail. Click-through rate (e-mail) measures the 
percentage of e-mail recipients who clicked through to the offer. Finally, bounce-back 
rate measures the percentage of e-mails that could not be delivered.
There is a lengthy path from simple online ad impressions, website visits, and 
page views to the purchase of a product and the company making a profit (see 
Figure 6.11). You first need to make customers aware of their needs for your product 
and somehow drive them to your website. Once there, you need to convince them 
you have the best value—quality and price—when compared to alternative provid-
ers. You then must persuade them to trust your firm to handle the transaction (by 
providing a secure environment and fast fulfillment). Based on your success, a 
percentage of customers will remain loyal and purchase again or recommend your 
website to others.

HOW WELL DOES ONLINE ADVERTISING WORK?
What is the most effective kind of online advertising? How does online advertising 
compare to offline advertising? The answers depend on the goals of the campaign, the 
nature of the product, and the quality of the website you direct customers toward. The 
answers also depend on what you measure. Click-through rates are interesting, but 
ultimately it’s the return on the investment (ROI) in the ad campaign that counts. 
More than 70% of marketing executives said they would spend even more on digital 
ads if ability to measure ROI improved (Tadena, 2015). Complicating matters is the 
difficulty of cross-platform attribution, which involves understanding how to assign 
appropriate credit to different marketing initiatives on a variety of platforms that may 
have influenced a consumer along the way to an ultimate purchase. There is increas-
ing recognition that first-click and last-click models that focus, as their names indicate, 
on either the first or last marketing channel or advertising format that a consumer 
engages with prior to a purchase, are no longer sufficient.

	 FIGURE 6.11	
AN ONLINE CONSUMER PURCHASING MODEL
The conversion of visitors into customers, and then loyal customers, is a complex and long-term process that 
may take several months.

Table 6.8 lists the click-through rates for various types of online marketing 
communications tools. There is a great deal of variability within any of these types, 
so the figures should be viewed as general estimates. Click-through rates on all 
these formats are a function of personalization and other targeting techniques. For 
instance, several studies have found that e-mail response rates can be increased 
20% or more by adding social sharing links. And while the average Google click-
through rate is less than 1%, some merchants can hit 10% or more by making their 
ads more specific and attracting only the most interested people. Permission e-mail 
click-through rates have been fairly consistent over the last five years, in the 3%–5% 
range. Putting the recipient’s name in the subject line can double the click-through 
rate. (For unsolicited e-mail and outright spam, response rates are much lower, even 
though about 20% of U.S. e-mail users report clicking occasionally on an unsolicited 
e-mail.) The click-through rate for video ads may seem low, but it is twice as high 
as the rate for banner ads. For instance, research by PointRoll found that adding 
video to a rich media campaign increased interaction rates by over 17% on average 
(PointRoll, 2015). “Interaction” means the user clicks on the video, plays it, stops it, 
or takes some other action.

How effective is online advertising compared to offline advertising? In general, 
the online channels (e-mail, search engine, display ads, video, and social, mobile, and 
local marketing) compare very favorably with traditional channels. This explains in 
large part why online advertising has grown so rapidly in the last five years. Search 
engine advertising has grown to be one of the most cost-effective forms of marketing 
communications and accounts for, in large part, the growth of Google. Direct opt-in 
e-mail is also very cost-effective. This is, in part, because e-mail lists are so inexpensive 
and because opt-in e-mail is a form of targeting people who are already interested in 
receiving more information.
A study of the comparative impacts of offline and online marketing concluded that 
the most powerful marketing campaigns used multiple forms of marketing, including 
online, catalog, television, radio, newspapers, and retail store. Traditional media like 
television and print media remain the primary means for consumers to find out about 
new products even though advertisers have reduced their budgets for print media 
ads. Consumers who shop multiple channels are spending more than consumers 
who shop only with a single channel, in part because they have more discretionary 
income but also because of the combined number of “touchpoints” that marketers are 
making with the consumers. The fastest growing channel in consumer marketing is 
the multi-channel shopper.
THE COSTS OF ONLINE ADVERTISING
Effectiveness cannot be considered without an analysis of costs. Initially, most online 
ads were sold on a barter or cost per thousand (CPM) impressions basis, with 
advertisers purchasing impressions in 1,000-unit lots. Today, other pricing models 
have developed, including cost per click (CPC), where the advertiser pays a prene-
gotiated fee for each click an ad receives; cost per action (CPA), where the advertiser 
pays a prenegotiated amount only when a user performs a specific action, such as a 
registration or a purchase; and hybrid arrangements, combining two or more of these 
models (see Table 6.9).
While in the early days of e-commerce, a few online sites spent as much as $400 
on marketing and advertising to acquire one customer, the average cost was never 
that high. While the costs for offline customer acquisition are higher than online, 
the offline items are typically far more expensive. If you advertise in the Wall Street 
Journal, you are tapping into a wealthy demographic that may be interested in buying 
islands, jets, and expensive homes in France. A full-page black and white ad in the 
Wall Street Journal National Edition costs about $250,000, whereas other papers are in 
the $10,000 to $100,000 range. 
One of the advantages of online marketing is that online sales can generally be 
directly correlated with online marketing efforts. If online merchants can obtain offline 
purchase data from a data broker, the merchants can measure precisely just how 
much revenue is generated by specific banners or e-mail messages sent to prospective 
customers. One way to measure the effectiveness of online marketing is by looking at 
the ratio of additional revenue received divided by the cost of the campaign (Revenue/
Cost). Any positive whole number means the campaign was worthwhile.
cost per thousand

sions in 1,000-unit lots
cost per click (CPC)
advertiser pays prenegoti-
ated fee for each click an 
ad receives
cost per action (CPA)
advertiser pays only for 
those users who perform a 
specific action

A more complex situation arises when both online and offline sales revenues 
are affected by an online marketing effort. A large percentage of the online audience 
uses the Web to “shop” but not buy. These shoppers buy at physical stores. Merchants 
such as Sears and Walmart use e-mail to inform their registered customers of special 
offers available for purchase either online or at stores. Unfortunately, purchases at 
physical stores cannot be tied precisely with the online e-mail campaign. In these 
cases, merchants have to rely on less precise measures such as customer surveys at 
store locations to determine the effectiveness of online campaigns.
In either case, measuring the effectiveness of online marketing communica-
tions—and specifying precisely the objective (branding versus sales)—is critical to 
profitability. To measure marketing effectiveness, you need to understand the costs of 
various marketing media and the process of converting online prospects into online 
customers.
In general, online marketing communications are more costly on a CPM basis 
than traditional mass media marketing, but are more efficient in producing sales. 
Table 6.10 shows costs for typical online and offline marketing communications. For 
instance, in 2016, the average cost for 30 seconds of commercial time during a prime-
time network television broadcast is about $112,000, not including the cost to produce 
the advertisement. According to Nielsen, such an ad has an average CPM of $24.76. 
In contrast, a banner ad costs virtually nothing to produce and can be purchased for 
a cost of $5–$10 per thousand impressions. Direct postal mail can cost 80 cents to $1 
per household drop for a post card, while e-mail can be sent for virtually nothing and 
costs only $5–$15 per thousand targeted names. Hence, e-mail is far less expensive 
than postal mail on a CPM basis. Effective cost-per-thousand (eCPM) is a metric 
that measures return on investment from an ad by dividing the total earnings from 
the ad by the total number of impressions in thousands.

“purchasing funnel.” We have characterized this as a process rather than a funnel that 
is composed of several stages: awareness, engagement, interaction, purchase, and 
post-purchase service and loyalty. Marketing analytics software collects, stores, 
analyzes, and graphically presents data on each of the stages in the conversion of 
shoppers to customers (see Figure 6.12). 
Marketing analytics packages can tell business managers how people become 
aware of their site, and where they come from (e.g., search, self-entered URL, e-mail, 
social campaigns, or off-line traditional print and TV ads), along with demographic, 
behavioral, and geographic information. Are shoppers coming from mobile devices, 
Facebook, or Pinterest? This information can help managers decide the best ways to 
drive traffic, the so-called “in-bound” links to a site. Once on the website, analytics 
packages can record how engaged visitors are with the site’s content, measured in terms 
of pages viewed and duration on site. This information can allow managers to change 
the design or their sites, or change the content viewers are seeing. For instance, video 
testimonials from product users may be much more engaging than expert reviews 
or user text comments. In a social marketing world, where consumers’ opinions and 
behavior can be harvested and broadcast to their friends, an important intermediate 
step in the consumer conversion process is to encourage visitors to interact with your

content and share their experiences, opinions, preferences, and behaviors with their 
friends, as well as other visitors to the site. Marketing analytics packages can track 
visitor interaction and help managers decide what content leads to higher levels of 
visitor interaction with friends and other visitors. The purchase activity on the shopping 
cart page is a major focus of analytics tools not just because this is where the revenue 
is generated, but also because this is where the customer frequently exits the entire 
site and the firm loses a potential sale. The current shopping cart abandonment is 
68% to 75% in the United States, with little change over the last few years, and higher 
in other countries (Baymard Institute, 2016). This seems like an extraordinary rate 
but, like most of the indicators discussed in this chapter, abandonment is a complex 
phenomenon and often not what it seems. Consumers use carts like a shopping list, 
and don’t complete the transaction immediately; they use it for price comparison 
and to know shipping costs, or taxes; they complete transactions later on a different 
device, such as a mobile phone. Another measure of near-purchase activity is the add-
to-cart rate. Marketing analytics software can help managers tease out the meaning 
of behavior on a website’s shopping cart page. Finally, marketing analytics can help 
managers discover customer loyalty and post-purchase behavior. In an increasingly 
social marketing environment, marketing managers need to know how their products 
and services are being talked about on other sites, Facebook pages, or Twitter tweets, 
often called “buzz” or sentiment analysis. Are the comments positive or negative? 
What is the source of negative comments? Possible candidates are poor quality, high 
costs, poor warranty service, and shipping issues. 
The end objective of marketing analytics packages is to help business managers 
optimize the return on investment on their marketing efforts, and to do this by build-
ing a detailed understanding of how their consumers behave. Marketing analytics also 
allows managers to measure the impact of specific marketing campaigns involving, 
say, discounts, loyalty points, and special offers, as well as regional, or demographic-
based campaigns. Aside from its role in enhancing management decision making, 
and optimizing the effectiveness of building an e-commerce presence, marketing 
analytics packages also enable a near real-time marketing capability where manag-
ers are able to change the content of a website, respond to customer complaints and 
comments, and align campaigns with trending topics or news developments, all in 
a near real-time manner (real-time may be a matter of minutes or at most 24 hours) 
(MarketingLand, 2015).
While there are a great many marketing analytics firms and software packages 
on the market, the leaders are Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, IBM Digital Analyt-
ics, and Webtrends. Marketing analytics software is often part of a comprehensive 
package sold to corporations from hardware, to web design tools, cloud services, and 
management expertise.

Real-Time Marketing
T
he holy grail of advertising and marketing is to deliver the right message 
to the right person at the right time. If this were possible, no one would 
receive ads they did not want to see, and then no advertising dollars 
would be wasted, reducing the costs to end users and increasing the 
efficiency of each ad dollar. In the physical world, only a very rough approximation of 
this ideal is possible. Advertisers buy television and radio spots, newspaper ads, and 
billboards based on broad demographics and interests of likely potential customers. 
The Internet promised to change this by gathering personal information on consumers 
and targeting ads to just the desired group of people based on their personal character-
istics, interests, and recent clickstream behavior. Consumer personal information was 
gathered through the use of cookies placed on the user's browser, which tracked their 
behavior and purchases online and could be matched with offline information as well. 
From the beginning, e-commerce was a trade-off between privacy and efficiency: let us 
know more about you, and we will show you only the advertising and products you are 
interested in seeing and would be likely to respond to. E-commerce was supposed to 
end the mass advertising that began in 19th century newspapers, 20th century radio, 
and exploded with the growth of television. 
But contrary to this rosy scenario, most of the display ads shown to site visitors 
are irrelevant, sometimes hilariously so, to visitors’ interests. For this reason, the

click-through rate for banner advertising is stunningly low, well under 1%, and the 
price of generic display ads is only $1.26 per thousand because of their low response 
rate. Check this out: visit Yahoo (the largest display advertiser on earth) on a desktop 
or laptop computer, look at the prominent ads shown on the right, and ask yourself 
if you are really interested in the ad content at this moment in time. Chances are 
slim you are interested at this moment, even if the ad is somewhat appropriate to 
your demographics. Often, it is an ad for something you have recently searched for 
on Google, or even already purchased at Amazon. These ads will follow you for days. 
Researchers have found that only 20% of Internet users find that display ads on web-
sites are relevant to their interests. Programmatic advertising promises to improve the 
targeting of ads, decreasing costs for advertisers, and making the Web less annoying 
to consumers by showing them ads that really are of interest to them. 
Digital display advertising has progressed through three eras. In the early 2000s, 
a firm with a website interested in ad revenue (a “publisher”) would sell space on its 
site to other firms (advertisers), usually through an ad agency. These were primarily 
manual transactions. By 2005, ad networks emerged. These networks aggregated thou-
sands of publishers' supply of ad space into a single network where advertisers could 
buy ad space on thousands of sites in a single purchase, and publishers could sell to 
hundreds of advertisers more efficiently. By 2011, even larger ad exchanges emerged, 
which provided advertisers access to an even larger pool of publisher ad spaces. The 
result today is an extraordinarily complex ecosystem of players, and sophisticated 
technologies (called a technology stack). 
With so much supply available, and so many buyers, automated methods were 
developed to allocate ad space to ad buyers. These methods are collectively called 
programmatic advertising. Programmatic advertising is an automated method that 
publishers use to sell their inventory (empty slots on their web pages) to advertisers 
who want to buy ad space for their customers (brand and product owners looking to 
market their products and services). There are two kinds of programmatic advertising: 
auction-based real time bidding (RTB), and programmatic direct, where advertisers 
deal directly with publishers who have developed their own supply side platforms.
Programmatic advertising platforms use big data repositories that contain personal 
information on hundreds of millions of online shoppers and consumers; analytic soft-
ware to classify and search the database for shoppers with the desired characteristics; 
and machine learning techniques to test out combinations of consumer characteristics 
that optimize the chance of a purchase resulting from exposure to an ad. All of this 
technology is designed to lower the cost, increase the speed, and increase the effi-
ciency of advertising in an environment where there are hundreds of millions of web 
pages to fill with ads, and millions of online consumers looking to buy at any given 
moment. Programmatic advertising allows advertisers to potentially show the right 
ad, at the right time, to just the right person, in a matter of milliseconds. To the extent 
this is true, display advertising becomes more effective, and perhaps could become 
as effective as search-based advertising, where it is much more obvious what the 
searcher is looking for, or interested in, at the moment of search. In 2016, advertisers 
are expected to spend over $25 billion (almost three-quarters of all total display ad 
spending, including on banners, videos, and rich media) on programmatic advertising. 

	
C a s e  S t u d y 	


This amount is expected to grow to over 80% by 2018. Programmatic advertising is 
roughly split between RTB and programmatic direct sales. Direct sales offer advertisers 
more control over ad display, location on the screen, and frequency than RTB. 
Currently, just one-third of online display advertising is still done in a non-auto-
mated, traditional environment that involves marketers using e-mail, fax, phone, and 
text messaging. Traditional methods are often used for high value ads, say, the top 
screen, expanding ads seen at major newspapers, magazines, and portal sites, and native 
ads appearing alongside organic content. This is the world of the traditional insertion 
order: if you want to advertise in a newspaper or magazine, call the ad department and 
fill out an insertion order. In this environment, firms who want to sell products and 
services online hire advertising agencies to develop a marketing plan. The ad agencies 
learn from the firms what kinds of people they would like to contact online. The ad 
agencies pay data brokers or advertising networks like DoubleClick to help them identify 
where the online ads should be placed given the nature of the product and the specific 
characteristics the producer firms are looking for. For instance, let’s say a firm wants 
to market a new mountain bike to men and women, ages 24–35, who live in zip codes 
where mountain biking is a popular activity. Ad networks traditionally would direct the 
agency to direct purchases of ad space from websites that attract the mountain biking 
audience. 
This traditional environment is expensive, imprecise, and slow, in part because 
of the number of people involved in the decision about where to place ads. Also, the 
technology used is slow, and the process of learning which of several ads is optimal 
could take weeks or months. The ads could be targeted to a more precise group of 
potential customers. While context advertising on sites dedicated to a niche product is 
very effective, there are many other websites visited by bikers that might be equally 
effective, and cost much less. 
The process is very different in a programmatic environment. Ad agencies have 
access to any of several programmatic ad platforms offered by Google, Yahoo, AOL, 
Facebook, and many smaller firms. Working with their clients, the ad agency more 
precisely defines the target audience to include men and women, ages 24–35, who live 
in zip codes where mountain biking is a popular activity, have mentioned biking topics 
on social network sites, have e-mail where mountain biking is discussed, make more 
than $70,000 a year, and currently do not own a mountain bike. The ad agency enters 
a bid expressed in dollars per thousand impressions for 200,000 impressions to people 
who meet most of the characteristics being sought. The platform returns a quote for 
access to this population of 200,000 people who meet the characteristics required. 
The quote is based on what other advertisers are willing to pay for that demographic 
and characteristics. The quote is accepted or denied. If accepted, the ads are shown 
to people as they move about the Web, in real time. As people come on to various 
websites they visit, the automated program assesses whether they meet the desired 
characteristics, and displays the mountain bike ad within milliseconds to that person. 
The programmatic platforms also track the responses to the ads in real time, and can 
change to different ads and test for effectiveness based on the platform’s experience. 
Once the system learns from experience, it will focus on showing the most effective 
ads on the most productive websites. Programmatic direct (or premium) advertising

uses the same platform, but publishers sell blocks of inventory to ad agencies rather 
than single impressions. This stabilizes their income, and puts them in closer contact 
with advertisers who can also exercise greater oversight over the publishers. 
The auto industry is a large user of programmatic advertising. Car brands are highly 
focused on specific demographic groups, income levels, and aspirations. A program-
matic campaign begins with the advertiser picking a demographic target, establishing 
a total budget for the campaign, and then choosing an RTB platform and competing 
for the delivery of an ad to that audience against other advertisers who may be other 
auto companies, retailers, or telecommunications providers. The ads are awarded and 
served automatically in millisecond-quick transactions.
Despite its clear advantages, there are also several risks involved for all parties. 
Programmatic advertisers lose some control over where their ads will appear on the 
Web. This is a threat to a brand if its products are shown on inappropriate sites. Adver-
tisers lose some accountability for their expenditures because they cannot verify that 
their ads are actually being shown, and they must take the ad platform’s word that 
indeed the ads are being shown to real people. This is a transparency issue. Ghost sites 
and ad fraud complicate the picture as well. There are thousands of ghost sites on the 
Web that do nothing but attract clicks using various ruses. Ad networks record this 
traffic and have little capability to determine if it is legitimate, and may show ads on 
these sites, which will generate fraudulent clicks that are paid for by the ad network 
and the advertising firm. 
Given the risks, many of the largest advertisers initially did not use program-
matic advertising, but that is rapidly changing. It was first used by publishers to sell 
inventory that was left over after the major ad campaigns had purchased the premium 
slots on web pages. Programmatic platforms were inexpensive places to sell excess 
inventory. However, that is beginning to change as advertisers gain confidence and 
the platforms themselves improve their abilities to avoid inappropriate websites, purge 
ghost sites, and learn how to detect click fraud. In addition, a number of firms have 
stepped into the market with tools that address these concerns.
For instance, in 2014, Procter & Gamble announced that, going forward, it planned 
to buy 70%–75% of its U.S. digital media using programmatic methods. P&G is the largest 
advertiser in the country, spending about $4.3 billion on advertising in the United States 
in 2015. In the past, P&G purchased premium online inventory at the top 100 comScore 
sites through several different ad agencies and tracked performance using its internal 
staff. According to P&G’s Chief Marketing Officer Marc Pritchard, programmatic advertis-
ing has allowed P&G to more precisely target its advertising at a good price, reportedly 
producing three to five times greater return on investment than through traditional 
methods. Other companies are following suit. Cleaning supply company Clorox devoted 
about 50% of its entire digital budget to programmatic advertising in 2015. 
However, some upstart web publishers aimed at the millennial demographic are 
trying to buck the trend. Vox Media, Refinery29, and Mic have all rejected program-
matic advertising and will only sell advertising space directly to advertisers. These 
publishers object on the ground that programmatic advertising can degrade website 
functionality by slowing down how fast web pages load in browsers while also clutter-
ing the site with ads that will annoy their visitors. Whether other web publishers will 
follow this lead remains to be seen.

K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Understand the key features of the Internet audience, the basic concepts of consumer behavior and purchasing, and 
how consumers behave online.
•	
Key features of the Internet audience include the number of users online, the intensity and scope of use, 
demographics and aspects, the type of Internet connection, and community effects.
•	
Models of consumer behavior attempt to predict or explain what consumers purchase, and where, when, 
how much, and why they buy. Factors that impact buying behavior include cultural, social, and psycho-
logical factors.
•	
There are five stages in the consumer decision process: awareness of need, search for more information, 
evaluation of alternatives, the actual purchase decision, and post-purchase contact with the firm.
•	
The online consumer decision process is basically the same, with the addition of two new factors: website 
and mobile platform capabilities and consumer clickstream behavior.
Identify and describe the basic digital commerce marketing and advertising strategies and tools.
•	
A website is the major tool for establishing the initial relationship with the customer. 
•	
Search engine marketing and advertising allows firms to pay search engines for inclusion in the search 
engine index (formerly free and based on “objective” criteria), receiving a guarantee that their firm will 
appear in the results of relevant searches.
•	
Display ads are promotional messages that users can respond to by clicking on the banner and following 
the link to a product description or offering. Display ads include banner ads, rich media, video ads, and 
sponsorships.
•	
E-mail marketing sends e-mail directly to interested users, and has proven to be one of the most effective 
forms of marketing communications.
•	
Lead generation marketing uses multiple e-commerce presences to generate leads for businesses who later 
can be contacted and converted into customers.
Case Study Questions
1.	 Pay a visit to your favorite portal and count the total ads on the opening page. 
Count how many of these ads are (a) immediately of interest and relevant to you, 
(b) sort of interesting or relevant but not now, and (c) not interesting or relevant. 
Do this 10 times and calculate the percentage of the three kinds of situations. 
Describe what you find and explain the results using this case. 
2.	 Advertisers use different kinds of “profiles” in the decision to display ads to 
customers. Identify the different kinds of profiles described in this case, and 
explain why they are relevant to online display advertising. 
3.	 How can display ads achieve search-engine–like results? 
4.	 Do you think instant display ads based on your immediately prior clickstream will 
be as effective as search engine marketing techniques? Why or why not?

Affiliate marketing involves a firm putting its logo or banner ad on another firm’s website from which 
users of that site can click through to the affiliate’s site.
•	
Viral marketing is a form of social marketing that involves getting customers to pass along a company’s 
marketing message to friends, family, and colleagues.

marketing, and interest-based advertising, customization and customer co-production, and customer ser-
vice (such as CRMs, FAQs, live chat, intelligent agents, and automated response systems).
•	
Online pricing strategies include offering products and services for free, versioning, bundling, and dynamic 
pricing.
Identify and describe the main technologies that support online marketing.
•	
Web transaction logs—records that document user activity at a website. Coupled with data from the regis-
tration forms and shopping cart database, these represent a treasure trove of marketing information for 
both individual sites and the online industry as a whole.
•	
Tracking files—Various files, like cookies, web beacons, Flash cookies, and apps, that follow users and 
track their behavior as they visit sites across the Web. 
•	
Databases, data warehouses, data mining, and profiling—technologies that allow marketers to identify 
exactly who the online customer is and what they want, and then to present the customer with exactly 
what they want, when they want it, for the right price.
•

Cart conversion rate—the ratio of actual orders to “Add to cart” clicks.
•	
Checkout conversion rate—the ratio of actual orders to checkouts started.
•	
Abandonment rate—the percentage of shoppers who begin a shopping cart form, but then fail to com-

Delivery rate—the percentage of e-mail recipients who received the e-mail.
•	
Click-through rate (e-mail)—the percentage of e-mail recipients who clicked through to the offer.
•	
Bounce-back rate—the percentage of e-mails that could not be delivered.
•	
Studies have shown that low click-through rates are not indicative of a lack of commercial impact of 
online advertising, and that advertising communication does occur even when users do not directly 
respond by clicking. Online advertising in its various forms has been shown to boost brand awareness 
and brand recall, create positive brand perceptions, and increase intent to purchase.
•	
Effectiveness cannot be considered without analysis of cost. Typical pricing models for online marketing 
communications include barter, cost per thousand (CPM), cost per click (CPC), cost per action (CPA), 
hybrid models, and sponsorships.
•	
Online marketing communications are typically less costly than traditional mass media marketing. Also, 
online sales can generally be directly correlated with online marketing efforts, unlike traditional market-
ing communications tactics.

Internet advertising agencies for case studies or examples of their work.) What are the advantages and/
or disadvantages of this kind of advertising? Prepare a 3- to 5-page report on your findings.
	 7.	 Visit Facebook and examine the ads shown in the right margin. What is being advertised and how do you 
believe it is relevant to your interests or online behavior? You could also search on a retail product on 
Google several times, and related products, then visit Yahoo or another popular site to see if your past 
behavior is helping advertisers track you.

hen Facebook issued its stock for 
sale in an initial public offering 
in 2012, it followed a very long 
build-up of excitement based on the belief that the 
company would turn into a marketing behemoth 
to rival or exceed Google, Yahoo, and Amazon. 
Facebook was, according to some analysts, the 
next Google in terms of an advertising platform 
and possibly even an e-commerce platform that 
could compete with Amazon. Facebook raised $16 
billion in the IPO, placing it in the “Big League” of 
e-commerce stock offerings. Offered at $38 a share, 
Facebook’s share price fell dramatically in subse-
quent months to a low of $17.50 in September 2012 
on investor fears that Facebook would be unable 
to increase its advertising revenues fast enough to 
justify its price. Flash forward to October 2016: 
Facebook’s shares have quadrupled their original offering price, having risen steadily 
for most of the last three years. Facebook has continually implemented new ways to put 
targeted ads in front of its increasingly mobile users. It appears to be succeeding, at least 
for now. 
Although Facebook initially flubbed its shift to mobile devices, the social network 
giant has made steady progress toward an effective mobile strategy. Throughout 2012, 
Facebook redesigned its Facebook app specifically for smartphones, introducing ads into 
users’ News Feeds, and creating a new kind of ad called “app-install ads,” which are ads 
paid for by Facebook app developers that encourage users to download their apps (usually 
for free). App-install ads and in-app ads became Facebook’s secret weapon that investors 
had not even heard about. Facebook was aided by a shift away from mobile browsers to 
apps. The time U.S. adults spend using mobile apps has grown over 110% over the past 
three years, and now accounts for 58% of total digital media time spent; time spent on 
the desktop now accounts for just 33%, and mobile browsers just 9%. U.S. adults are 
spending over 96 hours a month (about 3¼ hours a day) within apps on their smartphones 
and tablet computers.
Advertisers display ads within these apps, and Facebook shares the ad fees with 
the app developers. App-install ads, and ads within apps, are the largest single source 
of Facebook mobile ads. There are an estimated 10 million apps available on Facebook, 
and users install nearly 30 million apps every day. These apps range from games like

Candy Crush Saga, FarmVille, and Words With Friends, to music apps like Spotify and 
Pandora, to charity-oriented apps like Social Vibe and Charity Trivia. In-app ads have 
an advantage over standard News Feed ads: they are not perceived to be as disruptive or 
annoying as News Feed ads, and users are more willing to experience the inconvenience 
of being exposed to ads in return for a free game. 
In 2016, Facebook has almost 1.6 billion mobile monthly active users, represent-
ing over 90% of its monthly active users. Mobile now comprises over 80% of its total 
advertising revenues, up from 50% in recent years, and from nearly zero just a few years 
ago. Another factor in Facebook’s turnaround in social mobile marketing is its success 
with small local businesses. Facebook has more than 3 million businesses advertising on 
its platform in 2016, the majority of which are small businesses, and over 60 million small 
businesses have Facebook pages. 
Facebook has made a number of changes to its advertising toolkit in order to simplify 
the process of placing and targeting ads on its site for small business owners without 
professional marketing staffs. Its interface now allows advertisers to specify their objec-
tives, such as increasing likes, or increasing traffic to their website, or converting more 
visitors to sales. They can also choose where to place the ads—either in the Facebook News 
Feed or the right side column. Advertisers can target demographics, as well as general 
characteristics that Facebook users indicate in their profile, such as age, gender, education, 
and employment. Facebook has also added a tracking pixel, which allows advertisers to 
track customers who visit their website as a result of clicking a Facebook ad. 
One such business using Facebook’s new advertising tools is Little Passports, a firm 
created by two moms who wanted to design an inspiring and fun way for kids to learn 
about the United States and other countries. Little Passports is aimed at parents of 
young children ages 5–12, with newer options available for even younger children. Its 
business model is a subscription service that sends children monthly packages that take 
kids on virtual trips where they learn geography, history, and social life. Subscriptions 
are $11.95 a month. 
In 2014, Little Passports began a Facebook advertising campaign. The company ran 
ads featuring a photo of its Explorer Kit. Surrounding text urged people to subscribe to 
the service. Co-founder Amy Norman was able to choose who would see the ads based 
on gender, interests, location, relationship status, education, whether the person was 
expecting a child, and the type of mobile device used to access the ads (iOS vs Android). 
She also used a feature called Custom Audience to reach out to mothers who had a 
college background and read selected parenting magazines. Another tool that proved 
useful was Facebook’s LookAlike Audiences. LookAlike Audiences uses customer e-mail 
addresses provided by advertisers, looks at the demographic and behavioral trends in that 
group, and then generates a list of additional prospects based on its database of North 
American Facebook users (about 260 million people). Facebook pushes the ad to these 
“look-alikes.” If this sounds spooky, it is. But Facebook assures us that all the personal 
names are replaced with codes.
In just a few months, Little Passport’s ads attracted over 1,500 user comments, 
which were overwhelmingly positive. In June 2014, the company spent about $30,000 on

Facebook ads and its revenue for the month was about $130,000. After running the ad 
for six months, in December Little Passports spent $150,000 on Facebook advertising 
and its revenue rose to $700,000. Facebook advertising costs increased five-fold, and 
revenue advanced by 5.4 times, a little faster than the cost. Norman believes the Facebook 
campaign was worth the expenditure because it tripled Little Passport’s customer base in 
six months. Norman also felt that Facebook’s tracking pixel was a game changer because 
she could see exactly how well the ads were performing. In 2015, Little Passports sold 
its millionth subscription package.
In 2016, Facebook unveiled new tools for small businesses, including the ability to 
use LookAlike Audiences internationally to find promising markets. Little Passports used 
this feature to find international markets where it expected to generate enough sales to 
be viable, including France, Singapore, Sweden, and many other locations. The company is 
now on pace to reach $30 million in revenue in the near future, with 15% of sales coming 
from outside of the United States.
Investors in Facebook used to wonder if it would be able to continue to grow its ad-
vertising revenue. Marketers wondered if Facebook ads really worked. By 2016, Facebook 
had quieted those doubts. Facebook’s marketing success on both the desktop and mobile 
devices is currently based on the insertion of ads in users’ News Feeds and display ads in 
the right column of the home page. Currently an estimated 3% to 5% of all News Feed 
items are ads. If Facebook increases that percentage, how will users react? Zuckerberg, 
along with investors and marketers, was concerned that putting more ads in the News 
Feed was not the answer to sustaining future growth. One answer: video advertising using 
short video clips, and of course, challenging Google’s YouTube as a display platform for 
full-length videos and TV shows. In 2014, Facebook introduced an Autoplay feature, which 
allows videos to play automatically in the News Feed. Facebook has also reached out to 
some of Google’s video content producers and encouraged them to consider distributing 
their videos on Facebook. Facebook’s purchases of Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and 
WhatsApp for $22 billion in 2014 are also signs that Facebook is striving to become not 
just a social network, but an entire ecosystem.
Facebook’s financial results in recent years have quieted Wall Street’s doubts that 
it could become an advertising juggernaut. Facebook’s 2015 revenue was $18 billion, up 
significantly from $12.5 billion in 2014. In the second quarter of 2016, Facebook earned 
over $6.4 billion in revenue, with mobile ad revenue accounting for a whopping 84% of 
that figure. Very few marketers still have doubts about Facebook’s effectiveness.

INTRODUCTION TO SOCIAL, MOBILE, AND LOCAL 
MARKETING
Social, mobile, and local marketing have transformed the online marketing landscape. 
Before 2007, Facebook was a fledgling company limited to college students. Apple 
had not yet announced the iPhone. Online marketing consisted largely of creating a 
corporate website, buying display ads on Yahoo, purchasing AdWords on Google, and 
sending e-mail. The workhorse of online marketing was the display ad that flashed 
brand messages to millions of users who were not expected to respond immediately, 
ask questions, or make observations. The primary measure of success was how many 
“eyeballs” (unique visitors) a website produced, and how many “impressions” a market-
ing campaign generated. An impression was one ad shown to one person. Both of these 
measures were carryovers from the world of television, which measures marketing in 
terms of audience size and ad views. 
FROM EYEBALLS TO CONVERSATIONS
After 2007, everything began to change, with the rapid growth of Facebook and other 
social network sites, the explosive growth of smartphones beginning with Apple 
iPhone in 2007, and the growing interest in local marketing. What’s different about the 
new world of social-mobile-local marketing and advertising are the related concepts 
of “conversations” and “engagement.” Marketing today is based on businesses market-
ing themselves as partners in multiple online conversations with their customers, 
potential customers, and even critics. Your brand is being talked about on the Web 
and social media (that’s the conversation part). Today, marketing your firm and 
brands requires you to locate, identify, and participate in these conversations. Social 
marketing means all things social: listening, discussing, interacting, empathizing, and 
engaging. Rather than bombarding your audience with fancier, louder ads, instead 
have a conversation with them and engage them in your brand. The emphasis in 
online marketing has shifted from a focus on eyeballs to a focus on participating in 
customer-oriented conversations. In this sense, social marketing and advertising is 
not simply a “new ad channel,” but a collection of technology-based tools for com-
municating with shoppers.
In the past, businesses could tightly control their brand messaging and lead con-
sumers down a funnel of cues that ended in a purchase. That is not true of social 
marketing. Consumer purchase decisions are increasingly driven by the conversations, 
choices, tastes, and opinions of the consumer’s social network. Social marketing is all 
about businesses participating in and shaping this social process. 
FROM THE DESKTOP TO THE SMARTPHONE AND TABLET
In 2015, for the first time, spending on mobile marketing exceeded that spent on 
desktop/laptops. Figure 7.1 illustrates the rapidly changing trajectory of ad spending 
between 2012 and 2020. In 2013, marketers spent 75% of their online ad spending on 
desktops and only 25% on mobile. By 2019, that percentage is expected to totally flip, 

with 75% of ad spending devoted to mobile and only 25% to desktop/laptops. The 
marketing dollars are following customers and shoppers from the desktop computer 
to mobile devices. Today, social, mobile, and local marketing are the fastest growing 
forms of online marketing (Figure 7.2). In 2016, spending on mobile marketing will 
be almost triple the amount spent on social marketing. By 2018, it is estimated that 
mobile marketing spending will account for almost $70 billion annually, while social 
marketing will be about $24 billion. However, this figure underestimates the total 
social marketing spending because of the high percentage of visits to social networks 
that originate from a mobile device. For instance, Twitter reports that over 80% of 
their monthly active users access Twitter from a mobile device; over 55% of Face-
book’s active user base are mobile-only members (Protalinski, 2016; Twitter, 2016). A 
substantial part of the mobile marketing spending should also be counted as “social” 
marketing. Nevertheless, the figure indicates the extraordinary impact that mobile 
devices are having on marketing expenditures. Local online marketing was almost 
25% larger than mobile in 2015, but by 2016, it is expected that mobile will surpass 
local online marketing. As with social and mobile, there is significant overlap between 
local and mobile and social marketing, with much of local marketing being also either 
social or mobile, or both.  
The amount spent on mobile marketing far exceeds the amount spent on social marketing and is rapidly 
overtaking the amount spent on local online marketing as well.

THE SOCIAL, MOBILE, LOCAL NEXUS
Social, mobile, and local digital marketing are self-reinforcing and connected. ­ 
For instance, as mobile devices become more powerful, they are more useful for 
accessing Facebook and other social sites. As mobile devices become more widely 
adopted, they can be used by customers to find local merchants, and for merchants to 
alert customers in their neighborhood to special offers. Over time, these will become 
more overlapped as the three platforms become more tightly coupled. 
Over 80% of Facebook’s ad revenue is generated by its mobile audience. Mobile 
constitutes an even larger share of Twitter’s ad revenues—90%! Local marketing and 
mobile are highly related: local advertisers most often target mobile devices. And a 
considerable amount of mobile ad spending comes from local advertisers. The strong 
ties among social, mobile, and local marketing have significant implications for manag-
ing your own marketing campaign in this new environment. The message is that when 
you design a social marketing campaign, you must also consider that your customers 
will be accessing the campaign using mobile devices, and often they will also be

looking for local content. Social-mobile-local must be seen in an integrated marketing 
framework. Figure 7.3 puts social-mobile-local forms of advertising in context.
In the sections that follow we will examine social, mobile, and local marketing 
more closely. The focus will be on describing the primary marketing tools of each 
platform and how to envision and manage a marketing campaign on each platform.
	 7.2	
SOCIAL MARKETING
Social marketing differs markedly from traditional online marketing. The objectives 
of traditional online marketing are to put your business’s message in front of as many 
visitors as possible and hopefully encourage them to come to your website to buy 
products and services, or to find out more information. The more “impressions” (ad 
views) you get, and the more unique visitors to your site, the better. Traditional online 
marketing never expected to listen to customers, much less have a conversation with 
them, any more than TV advertisers expected to hear from viewers. 
In social marketing, the objective is to encourage your potential customers to 
become fans of your company’s products and services, and engage with your business 
by entering into a conversation with it. Your further objective is to encourage your 
business’s fans to share their enthusiasm with their friends, and in so doing create a 
community of fans online. Ultimately, the point is to strengthen the brand and drive 
sales, and to do this by increasing your “share of online conversation.” There is some 
reason to believe that social marketing is more cost effective than traditional marketing 
although this is still being explored.

ONLINE MARKETING PLATFORMS
Mobile marketing is aimed often at local audiences and is the fastest growing form of online marketing, 
followed closely by social marketing on social networks. Mobile local is in its infancy but it is also growing 
far faster than traditional desktop marketing.

SOCIAL MARKETING PLAYERS
There are hundreds of social network sites in the United States and worldwide, but 
the most popular sites (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat, 
and Tumblr) account for over 90% of all visits. (See Chapter 11 for a full discussion 
of social networks.)
While the number of monthly unique visitors is a good measure of market reach, 
it is not helpful in understanding engagement—the amount and intensity of user 
involvement in a site. One measure of engagement is the amount of time users spend 
on a site. Figure 7.4 illustrates engagement at the top social network sites.
On measures of engagement, Facebook once again dominates, accounting for 
85% of the total month visitor minutes, a whopping 230 billion minutes per month in 
the United States. The average Facebook user spent more than 18 hours a month on 
Facebook. Tumblr takes second place, followed by Pinterest and Twitter. 
For a manager of a social marketing campaign, these findings suggest that in terms 
of reach and engagement, the place to start a social campaign is Facebook. Yet visitors 
to the other leading social sites collectively account for an additional 15% of the social 
market space, and therefore, a social marketing campaign also has to include them at 
some point. It helps that social network users use multiple social sites. Facebook users 
are likely to be users at Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Snapchat. In 
addition, marketers need to be aware of what has come to be known as dark social. 
Dark social refers to those forms of social sharing that occur off the major social 
networks, through alternative communication tools such as interpersonal

conversations, group meetings, and friendships, not to mention e-mail, instant mes-
sages, texts, and mobile messaging apps. While online social network users spend over 
30 hours a month on average on all networks combined, there are 720 total hours in 
a month. Therefore, about 4% of all social life in a month involves online social net-
works, while 96% does not. 
THE SOCIAL MARKETING PROCESS
At first glance the large number of different social sites is confusing, each with a 
unique user experience to offer, from Twitter’s micro blogging text messaging service, 
to Tumblr’s blogging capability, and to graphical social sites like Pinterest and Insta-
gram. Yet they can all be approached with a common framework. Figure 7.5 illustrates 
a social marketing framework that can be applied to all social, mobile, and local 
marketing efforts.
There are five steps in the social marketing process: Fan acquisition, engagement, 
amplification, community, and brand strength (sales). Each of these steps in the 
process can be measured. The metrics of social marketing are quite different from 
those of traditional web marketing or television marketing. This is what makes social 
marketing so different—the objectives and the measures. This will become more 
apparent as we describe marketing on specific social sites. 
Social marketing campaigns begin with fan acquisition, which involves using 
any of a variety of means, from display ads to News Feed and page pop-ups, to attract 
people to your Facebook page, Twitter feed, or other platform like a web page. It’s 
getting your brand “out there” in the stream of social messages. Display ads on social 
sites have a social dimension (sometimes called “display ads with social features” or 
simply “social ads”). Social ads encourage visitors to interact and do something social, 
such as participate in a contest, obtain a coupon, or obtain free services for attracting 
friends.
The next step is to generate engagement, which involves using a variety of tools 
to encourage users to interact with your content and brand located on your Facebook 
or web pages. You can think of this as “starting the conversation” around your brand. 
You want your fans to talk about your content and products. You can generate engage-
ment through attractive photos, interesting text content, and blogger reports, with

plenty of opportunities for users to express opinions. You can also provide links to 
Pinterest photos of your products or fan comments on blog sites like Tumblr. 
Once you have engaged visitors, you can begin to use social site features to amplify 
your messages by encouraging users to tell their friends by clicking a Like or +1 button, 
or by sending a message to their followers on Twitter. Amplification involves using the 
inherent strength of social networks. On Facebook, the average user has 120 “friends.” 
This includes all people they have ever friended, including people whom they don’t 
really know (and who don’t really know them). Facebook users typically have only three 
to four close friends with whom they can discuss confidential matters, and a larger set 
of around 20 friends with whom they have two-way communications (mutual friends). 
Let’s use 20 as a reasonable number of mutual friends for marketing purposes. For 
marketers, this means that if they can attract one fan and encourage that fan to share 
his or her approval with his or her friends, the message can be amplified twenty times: 
20 friends of the one fan can be influenced. Best of all: the friends of fans are free. 
Marketers pay to attract only the initial fan and they are not charged by social sites 
(currently) for the amplification that can result. 
Once you have gathered enough engaged fans, you will have created the founda-
tion for a community—a more or less stable group of fans who are engaged and 
communicating with one another over a substantial period of time (say several months 
or more). Marketers have a number of tactics to nurture these communities, including 
inside information on new products, price breaks for loyalty, and free gifts for bringing 
in new members. The ultimate goal is to enlarge your firm’s “share of the online 
conversation.” The process ends with strengthening the brand and, hopefully, addi-
tional sales of products and services. Brand strength can be measured in a variety of 
ways both online and offline, a subject that is beyond the boundaries of this text (Aila-
wadi et al., 2003; Aaker, 1996; Simon and Sullivan, 1993; Keller, 1993).
Ultimately, the point of marketing is to drive sales revenue. Measuring the impact 
of a social marketing campaign on brand strength and sales is still being explored by 
marketers, social site managers, and researchers, but generally the results are posi-
tive: social marketing campaigns drive sales. In 2015, most of the top social network 
sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram, added, or were in the 
processing of adding, social commerce features, such as Buy buttons and other shop-
ping functionality that makes it even easier for the targets of those social marketing 
campaigns to act on them and make a purchase.
FACEBOOK MARKETING 
Nearly everyone reading this book has a Facebook page. There are power users who 
spend hours a day on the site, some with thousands of “friends,” and there are casual 
users who have a small set of perhaps 20 friends and relatives. While most have a basic 
understanding of Facebook, it’s worthwhile to review the major features of Facebook 
before discussing its marketing potential. 
Basic Facebook Features

Facebook as a marketing platform. Reviewing Table 7.1, it is clear that Facebook is

TABLE 7.1	
BASIC FACEBOOK FEATURES
F E A T U R E
D E S C R I P T I O N
Profile 
As part of account creation, you create a profile that includes certain personal information. The profile 
may also include photos and other media. Establishes baseline information that will be shared with 
friends. 
Friend search 
Helps you find friends who are already using Facebook, as well as friends who are not, typically by 
searching your e-mail contact list. Creates your baseline social network based on prior contacts. 
Timeline 
A history of your actions on Facebook, including photos, history of posts, and comments to your News 
Feed, as well as life events that you post and want others to see as a part of your profile. Additions you 
make to your Timeline may appear on your friends’ News Feed. Creates additional links with friends. 
Tagging
Ability to tag photos, status updates, check-ins, or comments with the names of friends. Tagging links to 
that person’s Timeline and News Feed. Your friends are notified they have been tagged, and you are 
linked to their Timeline. Friends of your friends may also be notified. Whenever Facebook detects the 
person in a new image, it notifies all those who have tagged the photo that this friend appears in a new 
photo that you can link to. The tagging tool is designed to create additional connections among users. 
News Feed
News Feed is a continuously updated list of stories from friends and Pages that you have liked on 
Facebook. Ads running in the News Feed are the major ad revenue producer for Facebook. News Feed 
stories include status updates, photos, videos, links, app activity, and Likes. Provides a continual stream 
of messages from friends and advertisers. 
Trending
Facebook’s version of trending topics; appears at top of right-hand column next to News Feed.
Status update
A way to post your comments, observations, and location to all your friends. 
Reactions buttons
In February 2016, Facebook redesigned its Like button functionality to add five additional buttons and 
rebranded it as Reactions. In addition to the familiar Like button, users can now register additional 
reactions, such as Love, laughter (Haha), surprise (Wow), sadness, and anger. 
Messenger 
Facebook's instant messaging app, used by over 1 billion people every month. In April 2016, Facebook 
began allowing companies to deploy chatbots on Messenger to provide automated customer support 
and other e-commerce services, and also began a trial of Sponsored Messages that would allow 
companies to send messages to customers who had previously engaged with them. 
Third-party Apps 
Third-party apps add functionality to Facebook. Apps run the gamut from games (Candy Crush Saga; 
FarmVille) to photos (Instagram, now part of Facebook), music (Spotify), and publications (Washington 
Post Social Reader). Your personal information and that of your friends is shared with apps that you 
install. Most apps are free, and most rely on revenues from advertising. 
Open Graph
A feature used by app developers to integrate their apps into the Facebook pages of users who sign up 
for the app, and in that sense, it opens the Facebook social graph to the developer, who can then use all 
the features of Facebook in the app. For instance, this feature allows your performance on game apps to 
be sent to your Friend’s News Feeds. Supports the development of social apps and increases links among 
users.
Search 
In 2013, Facebook introduced Graph Search, a “social” search engine that searched your social network 
for answers to queries. It was a “semantic” search engine insofar as it provided a single answer rather 
than a list of links based on an algorithm’s estimate of user intentions. It was also a “hybrid” search 
engine that relied on Bing to supplement results. In 2015, Facebook significantly expanded its Search 
functionality. It now focuses on keywords and includes everyone’s public posts, Likes, photos, and 
interests, and makes them available to all users of Facebook, friends or not. In June 2016, Facebook 
reported that users were doing 2 billion searches a day of its 2.5 trillion posts.

built to encourage people to reveal as much personal information about themselves 
as feasible, including activities, behavior, photos, music, movies, purchases, and prefer-
ences. One result is that Facebook is the world’s largest repository of deeply personal 
behavioral information on the Internet. Facebook knows a great deal more about its 
users than Google does about its users. Second, Facebook’s features are built to maxi-
mize the connections among people in the form of notifications, tagging, messaging, 
posting, and sharing. In many instances, the movement of personal information is so 
widespread that it is beyond the understanding of users and outside observers. The 
effect of these two factors is to greatly magnify the social density of the Facebook 
audience. Social density refers to the number of interactions among members of a 
group and reflects the “connectedness” of a group, even if these connections are forced 
on users. For instance, some natural groups of people are not very “social” and few 
messages flow among members. Other natural groups are loquacious and chatty with 
many messages flowing among members. The scope, intensity, and depth of Face-
book’s repository of personal information and rich social network present extraordi-
nary marketing opportunities. 
Facebook Marketing Tools
Facebook offers a number of marketing and advertising opportunities and tools for 
branding and developing community on its site. 
Reactions Buttons  The Reactions and Share buttons on Facebook, and similar buttons 
on other social sites, are perhaps the single most important element in the rise of 
social marketing. “Like” is the engine of social marketing. The Like button was intro-
duced by Facebook on its own website in 2009 and rolled out as a plug-in to other 
websites in 2010. In February 2016, Facebook added five additional buttons (Love, 
laughter (Haha), surprise (Wow), sadness, and anger) and rebranded the Like button 
as Reactions. Unlike traditional online advertising, the Reactions buttons give users 
a chance to share their feelings about content and other objects they are viewing and 
websites they are visiting. For instance, the Like button communicates your support 
of comments, photos, activities, brands, articles, and products to your friends, and also 
to the Facebook social graph and third-party marketers. The Reactions buttons are 
available on virtually all Facebook content, including status updates, photos, com-
ments, brands, timelines, apps, and even ads. The ubiquitous Like button also appears 
on external sites, mobile and social apps, and ads. These sites are utilizing Facebook’s 
Like social plug-in, and when you Like something outside of Facebook, it appears on 
your Timeline, where friends can comment on the activity. The Like button is one 
way Facebook knows what other sites you visit. According to Facebook, the Like button 
has over 10 billion views a day across millions of websites, with 30% of those impres-
sions coming on mobile devices (Facebook, 2016).
Brand Pages  Facebook’s early efforts at brand marketing focused on the develop-
ment of brand pages as a means for firms to establish a direct relationship with their 
current and potential customers. Nearly all Fortune 1000 companies, and hundreds 
of thousands of smaller firms, have Facebook brand pages, similar to brand websites,

on Facebook as an adjunct to their main website. The purpose of a brand page is to 
develop fans of the brand by providing users opportunities to interact with the brand 
through comments, contests, and offerings. Using social calls to action, such as “Like 
us on Facebook” and “Share,” brand pages can escape their isolation and make it more 
easily into users’ social networks, where friends can hear the message. In 2015, Face-
book began offering a new Shops tab for Facebook brand pages that features products 
and services, taking it further into the realm of social e-commerce.
Social brand pages have many more social opportunities for fans to like and 
comment than are typical of traditional web pages. However, corporate websites have, 
over time, adopted many social features and the two are now often indistinguishable. 
Brand pages on Facebook typically attract more visitors than a brand’s website. 
Brands can get exposure on Facebook either organically or via paid advertise-
ments. Organic reach is free, and happens when fans see the brand’s updates and 
posts in their News Feed, or when others who are not fans see that content because 
a fan liked, commented, or shared the post (viral reach). In order to ensure that they 
get the exposure that they want for their marketing messages, most companies choose 
one of the paid advertising formats discussed below. 
Facebook enables you to choose from a variety of different marketing objectives, 
including promoting your Page posts/ads (Page Post Engagement); obtaining Likes 
for your Facebook page to grow your company’s audience and brand (Page Likes); 
getting people to click through to your website (Clicks to Websites); getting people to 
take certain actions on your website (Website Conversions); getting people to install an 
app (App Installs); getting people to use an app (App Engagement); creating offers for 
people to redeem (Offer Claims); and getting people to watch a video (Video Views). 
Once you have chosen a marketing objective, the next decision is to whom you 
want to target the advertisement. Facebook ads can be targeted based on location, 
age, interest, gender, education level, relationship status, and political views, as well 
as to custom audiences defined by the marketer. Facebook can also create what it 
calls a “lookalike audience” based on demographics shared with the custom audience 
identified by the marketer. 
Once the marketing objectives and audience have been determined, the next 
decision is where to place the advertisement. Facebook has four basic locations from 
which to choose: the News Feed, the right-hand column or sidebar section of Facebook 
pages, and the mobile News Feed. Ads can also be placed within apps. 
News Feed Page Post Ads  The News Feed is the most prominent place for adver-
tisements. The News Feed is the center of the action for Facebook users and where 
Facebook users spend most of their time because that is where posts from their friends 
appear. Page Post Ads appear in a user’s News Feed along with all of the other posts 
and status updates that normally appear from friends. Page Post Ads have a tiny tag 
that indicates that they are sponsored (i.e., are advertisements) but otherwise look 
very similar to posts from friends. Sometimes the ads have a social context (“John 
Smith and Jane Doe like Pottery Barn”) and can be liked, shared, and commented 
on, just like any other post. Page Post Ads can contain text, photos, video, and links. 
They can be used for many of the marketing objectives mentioned above, such as 

436	
	
C H A P T E R  7     S o c i a l ,  M o b i l e ,  a n d  L o c a l  M a r k e t i n g
increasing brand engagement, obtaining Likes for the brand’s Facebook page, and 
encouraging app installs and engagement. In 2016, Facebook continues to pilot test a 
Buy button that appears in News Feed Page Post Ads that allows people to purchase 
items without leaving Facebook. Companies pay to promote or boost Page Post Ads 
in order to extend their reach. This has become increasingly important as Facebook 
has reduced the organic reach that brands previously enjoyed for free in an effort to 
increase advertising revenues (Vahl, 2014; Ernoult, 2014). 
Right-Hand Column Sidebar Ads  These display ads are located in the right-hand 
column or sidebar of Facebook pages. They are often used to direct users to off-
Facebook content such as website landing pages and content offers. Facebook has 
recently reduced the number of ads that appear in the right-hand column sidebar from 
seven to two, increased their size, and made them consistent with the format of News 
Feed Page Post Ads in an effort to enhance their performance. 
Facebook Live  Facebook introduced Facebook Live, its free video streaming service, 
in April 2016. Facebook Live can be used to stream live content that followers can 
interact with by commenting, liking and sharing. The video can be saved on a brand’s 
page and followers can continue to interact with it.
Video Ads  In March 2014, Facebook began showing 15-second video autoplay ads. 
In July 2014, it acquired Live Rail, an advertising network that now acts as the ad 
server for Facebook’s video ads. Since that time, Facebook video ads have become an 
increasingly important part of Facebook advertising strategy. In order to continue to 
grow its advertising revenue without overloading and turning off users by having too 
many ads, Facebook intends to focus on video ads, which command a premium and 
therefore generate more revenue. One challenge has been that video ads autoplay 
in silent mode, requiring advertisers to adapt their video for that medium. Another 
challenge has been the issue of metrics. In September 2016, Facebook admitted that 
for two years, it had been overestimating the average viewing time for video ads, 
possibly by 60%–80%, because it had only been including video views of more than 
three seconds in its metric.
Mobile Ads  Facebook introduced Facebook for Mobile in 2006. It now has over 1 billion 
daily monthly active users as of June 2016. Users can also access Facebook using a 
mobile browser although it is slower. In 2016, over 80% of Facebook ad revenue comes 
from its mobile ad platform, and it is its fastest growing revenue stream.
Because the smartphone screen is much smaller than regular computer screens, 
there is no room for sidebar ads on the right-hand column, so all mobile ads need to 
be displayed in the users’ News Feed. Mobile ads can include many of the ad formats 
described above, including video ad. Critics complain that the number of ads in the 
mobile News Feed becomes distracting and annoying. Mobile ads often take up the 
entire screen. There also is less targeting of mobile ads, which increases the likelihood 
users will see irrelevant ads. So far, despite the annoyance, Facebook mobile users 
continue to sign up and view.

Facebook Messenger  In April 2016, Facebook began allowing companies to deploy 
chatbots on Messenger, Facebook’s instant messaging app, to provide automated cus-
tomer support and other e-commerce services, and also began a trial of Sponsored 
Messages that would allow companies to send messages to customers who had previ-
ously engaged with them. In September 2016, Facebook announced a trial of a Buy 
button for its Messenger app that enables customers to make payments via Stripe or

Facebook Exchange (FBX).  Facebook Exchange (FBX) is a real-time bidding system 
that allows advertisers to target their ads based on personal information provided by 
Facebook. FBX competes with Google’s display ad system DoubleClick and other real-
time exchanges. Visitors to third-party websites are marked with a cookie, and can 
then be shown ads related to their web browsing when they return to Facebook.

Starting a Facebook Marketing Campaign 
Prior to starting a Facebook marketing campaign, there are some basic strategy ques-
tions you need to address. While every product presumably could benefit from a social 
marketing campaign, how is this true of your products? Who is your audience? How can 
you reach them? How have real-world social networks been used in the past to support 
sales in your industry? Can you be a “thought leader”? Once you have identified your 
audience, what content will get them excited and interested? Where are you going to 
get the content? What will it cost and what impact do you expect it to have on your 
brand and sales? At this point you do not need a detailed budget, but you should be able 
to develop estimates of the cost of such a campaign, as well as anticipated revenues. 
If you’re new to Facebook marketing, start simple and build on your fan base 
based on experience. A typical marketing campaign for Facebook might include the 
following elements:
•	 Establish a Facebook page for your brand. Content is king: have interesting, original 
content that visitors can be enthusiastic about. Acquire fans. 
•	 Use comment and feedback tools to develop fan comments. You want visitors to engage 
with your content. You can also encourage bloggers to develop content for your page. 
•	 Develop a community of users. Try to encourage fans to talk with one another, and 
develop new (free) content for your page. 
•	 Encourage brand involvement through videos and rich media showing products 
being used by real customers.
•	 Use contests and competitions to deepen fan involvement.
•	 Develop display ads for use on Facebook.
•	 Develop display ads for use in response to social search queries.
•	 Liberally display the Like button so fans share the experience with their friends.

mation on social marketing using Facebook, see Learning Track 7.1.

Measuring Facebook Marketing Results 
There are many ways to measure the success of a Facebook marketing campaign, 
some very sophisticated. This is a very new field that changes daily. Making matters 
more complicated is that industry sources sometimes use different names to refer to 
the same thing! Where this occurs we try to give both the most reasonable name and 
alternative names you might find in trade literature. 
Table 7.4 describes some of the basic metrics to use when evaluating a social 
marketing campaign. It uses the five steps of the social marketing process found in 
Figure 7.5—fan acquisition, engagement, amplification, community, and ultimately 
brand strengthening and sales—as an organizing schema. 
While the ultimate goal of Facebook marketing is to drive sales (which typically 
will take place on your website), it is very important to understand what the elements 
of social marketing that produce these sales are, and how they can be improved.

C H A P T E R  7     S o c i a l ,  M o b i l e ,  a n d  L o c a l  M a r k e t i n g
At the most elementary level, the number of fans (or followers) generated is the 
beginning of all social marketing. Visitors become fans when they like your content. 
In the early days of social marketing, firms put a great deal of emphasis on the size 
of the fan base, and collecting Likes. This is less important today, as social marketing 
managers have become more sophisticated. Fan engagement in your content and 
brand is the first step toward developing a truly social experience, and arguably is 
more important than simply the number of impressions or the number of fans. Fans 
that you never hear from are not valuable. Engagement relates to how your fans are 
interacting with your content, how intensely, and how often. Understanding the kinds 
of content (videos, text, photos, or posts from fans) that create the highest levels of 
engagement is also very important (Unmetric, 2015).
The ability to amplify your marketing message by tapping into the social network 
of your fans is also at the core of social marketing. This can be measured very simply 
as the rate at which fans recommend your content to their friends, and how many of 
their friends further recommend your content to their friends. 
Measuring the strength of a Facebook community is not that much different from 
measuring the strength of an offline community. In both cases you attempt to measure 
the collective activities of all in the community. Among your fans, how many actively 
participate? What is the total number of actions taken by fans in a month? How many 
minutes of involvement are generated each month? What is the percentage of favor-
able comments? 
Finally, measuring sales that result from social campaigns is also straightforward. 
First, measure the percentage of sales you receive from the Facebook channel. You can 
easily measure the number of visits to your website that originate on Facebook, and 
the sales these visits generate. In addition, you can compare purchase rates (conver-
sion rate) for fans and compare these to conversion rates for non-fans from Facebook. 
More important, you can compare the Facebook conversion rate to other visitors who 
come from different marketing channels, such as e-mail, display ads, and blogs. 
Facebook marketing has entered its second generation even though it’s only a few 
years old. The emphasis today in social marketing has gone beyond collecting Likes and 
more toward building engagement with high-quality content that fans want to share with 
their friends; nurturing stable communities of intensely involved fans and friends of 
fans; and ultimately turning these communities of fans into communities of purchasers. 
There are a variety of Facebook analytics tools that provide valuable information 
about your Facebook marketing efforts. Facebook Page Insights, provided by Facebook, 
tracks total Page Likes, People Talking About This (PTAT) (which tracks the number of 
unique people who have clicked on, Liked, commented on, or shared a post), Page Tags 
and Mentions, Page Check-ins, and other interactions on a page. It also tracks some-
thing it calls Engagement Rate. People are considered to have engaged with a post if 
they Like it, comment on it, share it, or click it (Simply Measured, 2016; AdRoll, 2015). 
Social media management system HootSuite enables teams to execute marketing 
campaigns across multiple networks from one dashboard, and also provides custom 
reports. Major analytics providers, such as Google Analytics, Webtrends, and IBM 
Digital Analytics, also provide Facebook reporting modules. Read the Insight on Tech-
nology case study, Optimizing Social Marketing with Simply Measured, for a further look

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
OPTIMIZING SOCIAL MARKETING WITH SIMPLY 
MEASURED
Companies of all shapes and sizes 
are now tapping into the power of 
social media for marketing and adver-
tising to improve their bottom line and 
enrich their relationships with their customers. 
As social media continues to become entrenched 
in the business and cultural landscape, an eco-
system of companies has sprung up around it to 
meet growing demand. One major area of growth 
is in social media analytics—tools that allow com-
panies to track and report social media account 
performance and generate recommendations on 
how to optimize social media marketing efforts. 
Simply Measured is a market leader in this bur-
geoning field, rating highest in overall customer 
satisfaction as well as market share.
Founded in 2010, Simply Measured is based 
in Seattle, Washington, and has quickly grown from 
humble beginnings (the founders built the original 
product over a single weekend) to a market-leading 
company that has raised almost $30 million in 
venture capital. It currently has 150 employees 
and more than 1,000 customers. Its rapid growth 
is due in part to the similarly rapid growth in social 
media platforms during that time. Marketers eager 
to tap into this emerging channel may not have the 
tools to understand what techniques are working 
and which need refinement. That’s where Simply 
Measured comes in.
Simply Measured offers analytics tools for 
all major platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, 
Instagram, Tumblr, LinkedIn, and YouTube. It 
also offers variations of those products for indi-
vidual market segments, such as retail, finance 
and insurance, consumer packaged goods, sports, 
restaurants, publishing, travel, tech, and telecom-
munications. Simply Measured’s solutions allow 
companies to plan their social strategy, execute 
it, and then find out what’s working best. Opti-
mizing social marketing techniques in this way 
leads to better audience engagement and better 
bottom-line results. Simply Measured generates 
reports both in Microsoft Excel and on the Web in 
clear, easily understood formats that can be shared 
across organizations.
Examples of typical basic reports include 
Facebook Competitive Analysis, which measures a 
Facebook page against other competitors in usage 
and engagement; Traffic Source Analysis, which 
determines what sources direct the most traffic 
to your site; and Twitter Follower Analysis, which 
analyzes an account’s followers for demographic 
information and activity trends. Whatever a com-
pany’s social marketing needs, odds are good that 
Simply Measured has solutions to help.
For example, the Seattle Seahawks football 
team are renowned for their passionate fan base, 
known as “The 12th Man,” and for their fans’ 
deafening crowd noise at home games. The orga-
nization hoped to create a similar atmosphere on 
social media as well, and turned to Simply Mea-
sured to help it achieve this goal. During the team’s 
playoff run in 2014, Simply Measured helped the 
Seahawks increase social engagement across all 
major platforms by a whopping 173%.
For a team with a large, motivated fan base, 
managing and understanding that level of social 
activity is impossible without the assistance of 
analytics. Using Simply Measured’s Cross-Channel 
Social Performance report, the Seahawks learned 
which social networks best suited their social 
media goals and created greater fan engagement. 
To their surprise, Instagram was extremely effec-
tive in this regard, so they focused more energy 
there. The Twitter Account Report indicated which 
content was most popular on Twitter and even 

442	
	
C H A P T E R  7     S o c i a l ,  M o b i l e ,  a n d  L o c a l  M a r k e t i n g
pointed to particular times of day that were 
most likely to generate a strong response. And 
the Twitter Competitive Analysis Report allowed 
the Seahawks to measure themselves against the 
rest of their peers in the NFL in key metrics like 
share of overall “voice” and fan engagement.
Simply Measured also offers a variety of 
resources detailing the state of social marketing 
in different market segments. For instance, the 
company analyzed BMW’s industry-leading Ins-
tagram account. The luxury carmaker towers over 
its competitors on Instagram, with over 260,000 
more tagged postings than its next closest rival, 
Jeep, from 2011 to 2015, and the most used 
branded hashtag on Instagram in 2015, #BMW. 
Simply Measured tracked BMW’s Instagram 
activity in 2016, and found that over 90% of 
the company’s posts are high-quality still images, 
which tend to generate the most engagement. They 
also found that BMW posts at a consistent rate, 
helping its brand stay in the consciousness of its 
followers and making it easier to determine which 
posts work and which posts don’t. And Simply 
Measured found that during its time tracking 
BMW, over half of the posts the company made 
were re-grams of photos taken by its followers, 
further improving brand engagement. BMW’s 
Instagram strategies helped it achieve a 5.6% 
increase in its audience over the period analyzed 
by Simply Measured. 
Like many startups, Simply Measured is 
using the money it has raised from venture 
capital to buy up other firms that can strengthen 
its main product line and enable it to branch out 
into related activities. In 2015, Simply Measured 
acquired Inside Social, a startup that helps 
marketing firms track the return on investment 
from social marketing campaigns, and DataRank, 
a social intelligence platform that helps firms 
organize and sift through mountains of online 
comments, helping firms analyze what is being 
said about them. With these acquisitions Simply 
Measured can tell its clients not only where to 
concentrate their efforts in terms of response, but 
also where they can make the best return on their 
investment of ad dollars. Simply Measured has 
also been adding to its executive team, naming 
two former executives from Salesforce.com as 
CEO and chief revenue officer in 2015 and a 
third Salesforce executive as its Vice President of 
Customer Success in 2016.
In 2016, Simply Measured released a social 
analytics attribution product that allows market-
ers to more accurately trace consumer interaction 
with content and enables marketers to track “dark 
social” interactions, such as those taking place 
on messaging services, mobile apps, e-mail, and 
SMS. The company also released an application 
programming interface (API) designed for mar-
keters that aggregates data from all major social 
media platforms. The API will allow marketers to 
make more specific queries without requiring the 
expertise of a data scientist. 
Using social media correctly can be difficult 
(see the Chapter 11 Insight on Society case, 
The Dark Side of Social Networks, for examples). 
With Simply Measured and other social media 
analytics providers, avoiding these pitfalls and 
getting the most out of social media becomes 
much easier.

marketing.
TWITTER MARKETING
Twitter is a micro-blogging social network site that allows users to send and receive 
140-character messages, as well as news articles, photos, and videos. Twitter has 
around 310 million active users worldwide as of 2016, and its 2015 revenue was $2.2 
billion, 50% more than its 2014 revenue. But Twitter lost $521 million in 2015, and 
has never been profitable since its founding in 2006. Investors have pummeled its 
stock down to $17 per share as of October 2016. Over 90% of Twitter’s users access the 
service on mobile devices. Almost all of Twitter’s revenue comes from pop-ads that 
appear in users’ timelines (tweet stream), but Twitter also has many other marketing 
tools in its quiver. One major advantage is that Twitter does not pay for the 500 million 
tweets sent each day. They are supplied for free by active users. Twitter sells ads based 
on the content of these user messages. See the opening case in Chapter 2 for more 
information on Twitter.
Twitter was designed from the start as a real-time text messaging service. Twitter 
offers advertisers and marketers a chance to interact and engage with their custom-
ers in real time and in a fairly intimate, one-on-one manner. Advertisers can buy ads 
that look like organic tweets (the kind you receive from friends), and these ads can 
tie into and enhance marketing events like new product announcements or pricing 
changes. Twitter is announcing new marketing tools every quarter in an effort to 
boost its revenues. On the other hand, there may be a limit to how many ads Twitter 
users will tolerate. 
Basic Twitter Features
While most people probably know what a tweet is, Twitter offers marketers many 
other ways of communicating using Twitter. In fact, Twitter has introduced a whole 
new vocabulary that is specific to Twitter’s platform. Table 7.5 on page 444 describes 
the most common Twitter features. 
Twitter Marketing Tools
There are many kinds of Twitter marketing products, and the firm is creating new ones 
every few months. The current major Twitter marketing tools include the following. 
Promoted Tweets.  Advertisers pay to have their tweets appear in users’ search results. 
Promoted Tweets are Twitter’s version of Google’s AdWords. The tweets appear as 
“promoted” in the search results. Pricing is on a “cost-per-click” basis, based on an 
auction run by Twitter on the Twitter ad platform and might range from $.50 to $10 
per engagement. An “ad carousel” allows up to 12 ads to be shown in a single space, 
enabling users to swipe through the Promoted Tweets. Promoted Tweets can be geo-
targeted and also offer keyword targeting that enables advertisers to send the tweets to 
specific users based on keywords in their recent tweets or tweets with which they have 
interacted. Promoted Tweets can be plain text or include a single or multiple images, 
or can include a website card (link to website), basic app card (link to app), or image 

444	
	
C H A P T E R  7     S o c i a l ,  M o b i l e ,  a n d  L o c a l  M a r k e t i n g
app card (photo plus link to app). Buy buttons embedded within Promoted Tweets 
enable users to purchase without leaving Twitter. In January 2016, Twitter introduced 
conversational ads, which enables marketers to include a call to action button with 
customizable hashtags to encourage consumer engagement within Promoted Tweets.
Promoted Trends.  Advertisers pay to move their hashtags (# symbol used to mark 
keywords in a tweet) to the top of Twitter’s Trends List. Otherwise, hashtags are found 
by the Twitter search engine, and only those that are organically popular make it to 
the Trends List. Promoted Trends cost about $200,000 a day in the United States and 
are also available for purchase in 50 different countries.
Promoted Accounts.  Advertisers pay to have their branded account suggested to users 
who are likely to be interested in the account in the “Who to Follow” list, Twitter’s 
account recommendation engine, on the Twitter home page. Promoted Accounts can 
be targeted by interest, geography, and gender, and are priced on a cost-per-follower 
	
TABLE 7.5	
TWITTER FEATURES 
F E A T U R E 
D E S C R I P T I O N 
Tweet
140-character text message. Messages can be private (to a 
single person or one to one), public (to everyone, one to many), 
or to a group of followers. 
Followers 
You can follow someone’s tweets and receive them as soon as 
they are made. Others can follow your tweets. 
Message (DM)
A direct private message (DM) is like an e-mail that only you 
and the recipient can read.
Hashtag #<word>
Like a Twitter search engine, #<word> organizes the 
conversations on Twitter around a specific topic. Click on a 
hashtag and you are taken to the search results for that term.
Mention
A public Tweet that includes another user’s name “@
username.” You can click on mentions and link back to that 
person’s profile. As a public tweet, your followers will be alerted 
as well. 
Moments tab
Curated highlights of what is happening on Twitter at that 
moment.
Reply
A public response to a tweet using the Reply button. Replies 
show up on your timeline and that of the person you are 
responding to. 
Timeline
Your timeline is your home page on Twitter listing the tweets 
you have received in chronological order, the most recent first. 
Click on a tweet in the timeline and it expands to reveal videos, 
and photos. Place your mouse over a tweet to reply, retweet, or 
make it a favorite (which is passed to your followers).
Retweet
Allows you to send along a tweet to all of your followers.
Links
Twitter has a link-shortening feature that allows you to paste in 
a URL of any link and it will be automatically shortened.

basis, with advertisers paying only for new followers gained. Prices range from $.50 
to $2.50.
Enhanced Profile Pages.  Companies get their own banner and the ability to pin a 
tweet to the top of the company’s timeline. The price reportedly ranges from $15,000 
to $25,000. 
Amplify.  The Twitter Amplify program provides marketers with a real-time digital 
dashboard so they can see the resulting tweet activity about the show or the brand. 
Based on this information, marketers can send Promoted Tweets to users who tweeted 
about a show. They can alter the copy as well based on other information about the 
tweeters. For example, Jim Beam used Amplify to promote its new Jim Beam Red Stag 
brand of premium bourbon. The intent was to increase brand awareness, purchase 
intent, and user engagement. The strength of Twitter, according to Jim Beam market-
ers, is that it allows the brand to be a part of a real-time conversation, as opposed to 
Facebook, which is better at reaching a mass audience but not at engaging consumers 
in real time. The power of social media, including Facebook, is finding consumer 
advocates who will speak on behalf of the brand. 
Promoted Video.  In 2014, building on the Amplify program, Twitter announced 
a beta test of Promoted Video, which allows advertisers to distribute video on the 
Twitter platform. In 2015, Twitter began allowing advertisers to use Promoted Video 
to link directly to app installations and also added an ad purchasing feature for videos 
called “optimized action bidding” that enables marketers to customize ad purchases 
to improve return on investment.
Television Ad Retargeting.  Millions of users tweet with their friends while watching 
television, and Twitter can follow the conversation to identify who is watching a 
particular show. Marketers displaying TV ads can retarget those ads or other messages 
to tweeters in real time to reinforce their marketing message. Advertisers with video 
content, like the National Basketball Association, insert in-tweet video clips, which are 
video replays. Advertisers can precede the video with an ad, or place an ad just below 
the video on screen. Companies can follow up with a Promoted Tweet. 
Lead Generation Cards.  Marketers can embed a “card” into a tweet. When users click 
on the tweet, a promotional offer appears and users are asked to sign up. Cards are 
different from display ads because they are used only by businesses who want to 
develop new leads, and they always include an offer, such as 50% off your next cup 
of coffee. This is a one-click process. The users’ e-mail and Twitter account names 
are automatically obtained by Twitter and sent to marketers, who can then follow up 
with a tweet or an e-mail. 
Mobile Ads.  Because over 90% of Twitter users access Twitter on a mobile device, 
most of the above referenced marketing tools can be considered mobile ads tools. 
Mobile is also proving to be the primary driver of Twitter’s business and the source 
of most of its revenue. In addition to all of the above formats, in April 2014, Twitter 

446

added mobile app install and app engagement ads, which have been lucrative formats 
for Facebook as well.
Table 7.6 summarizes these Twitter marketing tools.

•	 Establish a Twitter account. Start following others you are interested in or conversa-
tions that you might want to participate with #<topic>. Don’t expect any followers 
at first. Your visibility rises as you follow others, who will begin to tweet back or 
retweet interesting content. Then start retweeting content you think the group 
would be interested in, and start encouraging ongoing conversations. 
•	 Try a simple Promoted Tweet. Twitter has a very good online ad facility that will 
allow you to define an ad, establish the groups you would like to target, and under-
stand the costs. You might start with a regional or metropolitan Promoted Tweet. 
Test various formats. You don’t have to pay for Promoted Tweets unless someone 
clicks on the tweet, so it is up to you to make those clicks count. Direct users to 
your website and offer a coupon or discount. 
•	 Promoted Trends can be very expensive—around $200,000. If your budget will 
allow, and your topic is of general interest to a large audience, you can try this tool. 
Geo-targeting is possible. 
•	 TV ad retargeting is obviously a big business tool for media companies that have 
television content and television ads. Retargeting these to the Twitter community 
strengthens the overall brand image, and can direct people to the firm’s website.
•	 Lead Generation Cards are something that small and medium-sized businesses can 
use. If you sell anything locally, from pizza to stationery, make up an offer and 
build a Lead Generation Card specifying the geo-location where your business is 
located. 
As with Facebook, the objective is to establish your brand identity online and seek 
out engagement with users, not immediate sales. Encourage others to retweet your 
content and offers to their friends.

Measuring Twitter Marketing Results
Measuring the results of Twitter marketing is similar to measuring the results of 
Facebook and other social marketing platforms, with some minor changes to account 
for the unique qualities of Twitter. Table 7.8 describes some basic ways to measure 
the results of a Twitter marketing campaign. 
Tools provided by Twitter include a dashboard that provides real-time informa-
tion on impressions, retweets, clicks, replies, and follows for Promoted Tweets and 
Promoted Accounts. Twitter’s Timeline activity dashboard provides data on how every 
tweet performs in terms of mentions, follows, and reach. Twitter’s Followers dashboard 
enables marketers to track the growth of the follower base, as well as information about 
their interests, geography, and engagement.
Third-party tools include TweetDeck, which enables you to track mentions, 
people, and keywords; Twitalyzer, which provides one-click access to Twitter metrics 
that analyze followers, mentions, retweets, influencers, and their locations; and Back-
Tweets, which allows you to search through a tweet archive for URLs sent via Twitter.
PINTEREST MARKETING
Pinterest provides users with an online board to which they can “pin” interesting 
pictures (see also the Chapter 1 closing case study, Pinterest: A Picture Is Worth a

Thousand Words). The success of Pinterest is based in part on a shift in consumer 
behavior enabled by new technologies: people talk about brands using pictures rather 
than words. Large numbers of users are pinning and instagramming about their lives 
using pictures. 
Pinterest has been one of the fastest growing sites in online history. In 2010, Pinter-
est had 10,000 users in the United States, then 12 million by the end of 2011, and 150 
million by 2016. Today, about 17% of online adults in the United States use Pinterest on 
a regular basis. Pinterest’s visitors are overwhelmingly female: about 75% are women, 
but men were its fastest growing demographic in 2015, and its users cover a broad age 
demographic range from grandparents to teenagers, with the largest segment (about 
25%) between 25 and 44. The hope for marketers, and Pinterest, is that its “referral 
capacity” (the ability to direct users to retail websites where they can purchase some-
thing) will rapidly increase as its audience grows and intensity of use grows. 
You can think of Pinterest as a highly interactive and social online magazine. 
One difference, of course, is that users (including business firms) contribute all the 
photos. The site currently has 36 categories of boards from gifts, animals, art, cars, and 
motorcycles to crafts, food, and men’s and women’s fashion. Users can pin to these 
boards, create their own boards, and follow other pinners and boards as well. Firms 
can create their own brand boards and product pins. As of October 2016, there were 
over 50 billion pins on Pinterest on more than 1 billion different boards. 
One way to look at the billions of pictures on Pinterest is as disguised display 
ads—click, and off you go to a brand website for a purchase. Pinterest pins are much 
better than display ads because they are unobtrusive, and because they don’t look 
like display ads. Instead, they look like sumptuous catalog or magazine photos. In 
the future, analysts believe, Pinterest could charge an affiliate fee for any subsequent 
purchases. Pinterest could also charge businesses for creating brand sites or boards, 
which currently are free. 
Basic Pinterest Features 
Marketing on Pinterest requires that you understand the basic features and capa-
bilities of Pinterest. While all users of Pinterest understand how to pin photos to an 
online scrapbook, many other capabilities are less well understood or used. Table 7.9 
­provides a list of Pinterest features. 
Pinterest Marketing Tools 
Pinterest’s first step into the marketing arena was to offer business accounts that 
provided additional resources for brands. In 2013, it introduced Rich Pins, which 
allowed companies to embed information, such as current pricing and availability, as 
well as a direct link to a product page. In 2014, Pinterest took the official leap into paid 
advertising. It launched Promoted Pins with a select group of national brands and also 
announced a trial of a Do It Yourself version of Promoted Pins for small and medium-
sized businesses, to be paid for on a cost per click basis, similar to the Google AdWords 
platform. Promoted Pins appear in search results and category feeds. In 2015, Pinterest 
rolled out Promoted Pins to all its U.S.-based partners and added Cinematic Pins. It 
also added Buyable Pins for eligible merchants on select e-commerce platforms such

as Shopify, BigCommerce, Magento, and Demandware, and a Shop Our Picks feature, 
allowing users to buy products directly on the Pinterest site, and pay with Apple 
Pay. The Shop our Picks feature highlights hand-picked items for users to consider 
purchasing. It also introduced new ad-targeting and pricing options. In 2016, it added 
additional ad-targeting options, began offering its search inventory to advertisers for 
the first time and launched Promoted Video ads. Table 7.10 identifies and describes 
some of the primary Pinterest marketing tools.
For instance, Lands’ End has several brand pages on Pinterest, one of which is 
Lands’ End Canvas. Search for Lands’ End Canvas and it takes you to the page that

Rich Pins
Rich Pins enable advertisers to include extra information directly 
on the pin itself. There are six types of Rich Pin: Product, App, 
Place, Article, Movie, and Recipe. Product Pins include real time 
pricing, availability and link to where the item can be purchased. 
App Pins include an install button that allows a user to 
download an app without leaving Pinterest. Place Pins include a 
map, address, and phone number. Article Pins include a headline, 
author, and story description. 
Promoted Pins
A way to promote pins to a targeted audience, and pay for click-
through to your website.
Cinematic Pins

when the user scrolls down through the ad; only plays a full-
length version when the user clicks on the ad, providing more 
user control over the experience.
Buyable Pins/Shop Our Picks
Eligible merchants can create Buyable Pins that allow users to 
purchase product featured in pin without leaving Pinterest. Shop 
our Picks feature highlights hand-picked items for users to 
consider purchasing.

Add Pin It or Follow button to 
your website (Pinterest 
widget)

be notified when you post new photos to your site.
Pin as display ad 
Pinned photo acts as a display ad by directing users back to a 
firm’s website. 
Brand page 
Allows companies to create a corporate brand page. In the past, 
Pinterest did not distinguish between a personal page and a 
corporate brand page. 
Create theme-based boards to 
reflect your brand messaging
Pinterest recommends that business boards not be strictly sales-
oriented, but lifestyle-oriented instead. 
URL Link to stores
Makes it easier for consumers to click through links on brand 
pages and product pins so they can reliably purchase what they 
see. The goal is to integrate photos of inventory with Pinterest to 
make items more easily tracked. What this means is retailers can 
see a definite link between a sale and a photo they pinned. 
Currently, after thousands of repins, clicking on the URL 
sometimes leads to a broken link.
Integration with other social 
sites 
Ask your Facebook fans and Twitter followers to pin photos of 
your products and tag you. Repin these photos to your brand 
page on Pinterest. Give a shout-out to your loyal users and fans 
to show potential customers how much current users like using 
your product. 
Network with users, followers, 
and others 
As with Facebook and Twitter, comment, mention, and 
communicate with others using Pinterest. Participate in the 
community and you will become better known, and learn more 
about potential customers and what they believe and to what 
they aspire.

Lands’ End Canvas created and where Lands’ End has pinned some of its catalog photos. 
On this brand page, only Lands’ End Canvas products are pinned, and the company is 
identified. You can see the number of people who have pinned these photos elsewhere, 
and the total number of others who follow this line of clothing and have posted their 
own photos. When you click on a photo, you get a larger version of the photo (sometimes 
called a photo landing page), and the chance to link to the website (canvas.landsend.
com) where you can purchase the product and find similar ones. You will also see on 
this photo landing page a picture of the person who pinned the photo, other boards 
where it was pinned, and recommendations for related photos and products in a section 
titled “People who pinned this also pinned....” Table 7.11 provides a brief description of 
Pinterest marketing campaigns of selected other retailers. 
Starting a Pinterest Marketing Campaign
Before leaping into a Pinterest campaign, ask yourself some questions about your 
products and services, and then identify some strategic objectives for your Pinterest 
presence. First, sketch out a vision of what you hope to accomplish with a Pinterest 
presence. Are you an established company trying to strengthen your brand? Are you 
the new kid on the block that no one knows and you want to start a marketing cam-
paign? Are your products visual and can your brand be expressed in a set of pictures? 
Most products have a visual component, some more compelling than others. Is the 
consumer accustomed to seeing the products in your industry expressed through 
photos? For instance, food is increasingly a visual experience with the growth of food 
magazines and websites. 
Next, consider the target demographic for your products and services, and 
compare it to the Pinterest demographic. Currently, about 75% of Pinterest’s users

are women, and while this might change over time, your offerings will have to be 
attractive to women. Do your products or services appeal to this demographic?
Think about strategy in your marketspace. What are your competitors doing? Are 
they on Pinterest? Do they have an effective presence? What types of people follow 
your competitors and what are the users pinning? How many followers, re-pinners, 
brand pages, and product pins are there? Because photos are central to a Pinterest pres-
ence, where will the photos for your brand pages come from? Are you, or a member 
of your team, a skilled photographer? You can pin photos from all over the Web, and 
from other Pinterest boards, but then you’re just sharing content, not creating unique 
and unusual content. 
Pinterest is an adjunct to a fully developed marketing plan, both online and 
offline. You will want to integrate your social and online marketing efforts with a 
Facebook and Twitter presence. You can share photos from your website, and send 
web photos to your brand pages. The same photos can be used on your Facebook page 
and on Twitter. Your customers will be using all these platforms and you will have to 
follow them to keep up. 
Once you have envisioned your Pinterest campaign and developed a marketing 
plan, you can start implementing your plan. In order to implement your Pinterest 
plan, you should have a traditional website where your products are displayed (a 
catalog) and can be purchased. Second, you should also have a Facebook brand page 
to develop followers and a method for informing your followers of new Pins. Once 
these are in place, you can begin your Pinterest campaign:
•	 Create a Pinterest brand page and start pinning photos of your products. Continue 
to add more pins, and change them regularly. Be sure your photos are the same 
quality level or higher than those of your competitors. If necessary, hire a skilled 
photographer. Brand pages generally do not allow followers to pin photos but only 
to follow and comment. The idea here is to control the content of your brand page, 
and develop other boards where followers can pin pictures. 
•	 Create multiple theme-based life style boards. Develop several theme-based boards 
that emphasize life styles or fashions. Pinterest is not just, or even primarily, a 
selling site. It is also an entertainment and branding site. You want followers to 
adore your photos. On theme-based boards you will want others besides yourself 
to be able to pin. 
•	 Use URL links and keywords. Make sure your pins have a URL link to your store, 
or to vendor stores, so followers can easily buy as well as “see.” Be sure to use 
keywords and hashtags to classify each of your photos so they show up in Pinterest 
searches. Remember, Pinterest cannot “see” a photo or understand its content. It 
only “knows” the content based on your tags. 
•	 Use Pinterest Rich Pins. If you are in the food, retail, or movie distribution business, 
Product Pins are worth a try if you have a popular product at an attractive price, 
or if you want to use a specific product as a loss-leader to motivate people to come 
to your website (where you can expose them to your entire catalog of products). 
Once you have some experience with Rich Pins, you can also experiment with

C H A P T E R  7     S o c i a l ,  M o b i l e ,  a n d  L o c a l  M a r k e t i n g
the various types of paid advertising that Pinterest offers, such as Promoted Pins, 
Cinematic Pins, and Video Ads. 
•	 Use Pin It buttons. Add a Pin It button to your website and Facebook page to encour-
age fans and followers to pin your photos to their own boards, and to recommend 
them to friends. 
•	 Use your Facebook and Twitter networks. Start using your Facebook and Twitter 
networks by adding a Pin It button to Facebook (also called a Pinterest tab), and 
start sharing your pinned photos with your followers.
•	 Integrate with Facebook and Twitter. Create Facebook and Twitter logins so that 
users can go to your pins and boards without leaving the Facebook and Twitter sites. 
•	 Be social. Join the conversation. Follow other pinners and boards and ask to receive 
e-mail and Facebook updates.
Measuring Pinterest Marketing Results 
As with any social marketing platform, the key dimensions to measure for a Pinterest 
marketing effort are fan (follower) acquisition, engagement, amplification, commu-
nity, and sales. Table 7.12 describes some basic ways to measure the results of a 
Pinterest marketing campaign.
Pinterest provides a built-in web analytics service that offers insights into how 
people are interacting with pins that originate from their websites. There are several 
firms that will help produce the metrics referred to in Table 7.12. For instance, Curalate 
is an online service to measure the impact of Pinterest and other visual social media. 
It listens and measures visual conversations by seeing what pictures users pin and 
repin, and also analyzes the colors in the picture. Curalate currently has over 450 
brands using its platform.
MARKETING ON OTHER SOCIAL NETWORKS
There are a great many social networks where products and services can be marketed, 
the largest of which include Instagram, LinkedIn, and Snapchat. Instagram is a visual 
social network: users and advertisers post photos and videos to their friends, potential 
customers, and the public at large. In 2016, Instagram (owned by Facebook) has over 
500 million users worldwide and over 200,000 active advertisers. Instagram is a mobile-
first platform that particularly appeals to Millennials. In 2016, 90% of Instagram’s 
audience is under 35, and by the end of 2016, it is expected to have around 50 million 
U.S. Millennials as active users. In 2016, analysts estimate Instagram will generate 
around $3.2 billion in ad revenues (AdRoll, 2016). 
As with other social networks, users create a profile. There is a Feed that provides 
a listing of photos and videos (up to 15 seconds long) posted by friends or advertisers. 
Using a feature called Direct, users can send photos and videos to specific people. 
Using Explore, users can search for public profiles and photos. Instagram also has a 
powerful photo editing suite called Layout. 
Similar to Facebook, advertisers have brand profiles and run marketing campaigns 
by sending posts to users’ Feeds. Instagram ad campaigns consist of display ads and 

	
S o c i a l  M a r k e t i n g 	

455
video ads of exceptional quality, similar to a printed magazine. Carousel ads can 
include multiple still photos or videos in a single ad. Ads can link to advertiser’s web-
sites and now can include a Buy button. For brands that want to drive mass awareness 
around premieres, product launches, and key moments, Instagram developed what it 
calls its Marquee ad product, which reaches millions of people. Marquee ads generally 
last a single day, promise to deliver a guaranteed number of impressions, and can 
be posted several times during the day to catch different audiences. In August 2016, 
Instagram also added a “Stories” feature to compete with a similar feature offered by 
Snapchat. Stories typically include a montage of images and/or videos, sometimes 
annotated with graphics and emoticons, and disappear after 24 hours. Although not yet 
offered as a paid advertising product, a number of major brands have already eagerly 
embraced the format and have begun to regularly include Stories in their Instagram 
marketing efforts (Shields, 2016).
LinkedIn, while generating far less average engagement, nevertheless attracts a 
highly educated, professional, and managerial audience that is intensively engaged 
in careers and employment. LinkedIn is a social network focused on professional 
networking, where users post their resumes, and potential employers hunt for new 
hires. See the opening case in Chapter 11 for more information on LinkedIn.
As with other social networks, users build a profile, but in this case, sharing their 
professional background, degrees, employment, and skill set. Companies can create

a free company profile page that includes a logo, header image, an About section, 
and various posts. Companies can also create a showcase page to highlight a specific 
product or service, as well as a Career page (which requires payment) targeted at 
recruiting. There is a Feed that provides a listing of posts from colleagues and friends, 
and sponsored posts (ads) from firms. Display ads also appear on the right and bottom 
of the page. Advertisers can used LinkedIn’s self-serve advertising platform or place 
ads using LinkedIn Advertising Partner Solutions, which provide more variety and 
ad options than self-service ads, including premium display advertising, sponsored 
inMail, and ads that urge users to follow a specific company or join a specific group. 
LinkedIn also recently began providing a publishing platform called LinkedIn Pulse, 
which allows users to publish articles to expand their brand and thought leadership. 
The primary contribution of LinkedIn is to develop personal brands for profes-
sional managers and to create a marketplace where employers can contact suitable 
candidates. Advertisers tend to use LinkedIn for branding purposes and typically are 
not soliciting sales. 
Snapchat is a mobile messaging app/social network that allows its users to chat 
and send images and videos (snaps) that disappear after a relatively short period of 
time once they have been viewed. Snapchat bills itself as method for visually captur-
ing important moments and communicating them creatively via a variety of tools 
such as geofilters (which tailor an image to the user’s location) and lenses (a type of 
augmented reality that allows users to alter their face in a variety of ways). Snapchat 
was initially aimed at the under-25 demographic and in 2016, Millennials represent 
70% of Snapchat’s almost 60 million monthly active U.S. users. However, Snapchat 
has begun to record significant growth in the 25-to-34-year-old age group, as well 
as those over 35. In addition to targeting a desirable demographic, Snapchat is also 
attractive to advertisers because research indicates that it is also very sticky within 
that demographic, with three out of four college-aged U.S. users indicating that they 
use the app every day, and over 50% saying that they used it many times a day and 
even constantly. Snapchat itself reports users worldwide spending 25 to 30 minutes 
a day using the app. 
Since it was initially released, Snapchat has introduced a number of features 
that present advertising opportunities, including Snapchat Stories (a way for users to 
simultaneously share snaps, which remain live for 24 hours, with all or just some of 
their friends), Live Stories (a compilation of snaps from various users at events and 
locations around the world that are compiled by Snapchat editors into a Live Story 
that typically has a lifespan of 24 hours), and Discover (unique content from brands 
chosen by Snapchat). Snapchat offers advertisers three types of “native” ads: Snap Ads 
(short 10-seconds or less full-screen vertical video ads that have audio turned on by 
default), Sponsored Geofilters (geofilters that use brand imagery and messaging), and 
Sponsored Lenses (lenses that use brand imagery). Interactive versions of Snap Ads 
(known as Snap Ads with Attachments) are also available, and allow a user to swipe 
to extend the ad to view additional video, an article, a web page, or an app install 
offer. Ads can be purchased on a flat fee or cost-per-thousand (CPM) impressions 
basis. Snapchat’s targeting capabilities are currently less developed than most of its 
social network competitors, but plans are in the works for enhanced targeting options.

Snapchat is expected to generate around $367 million in ad revenues in 2016, with that 
number increasing to nearly $1 billion in 2017. Currently, Snapchat’s Discover feature 
is the primary driver of its U.S. ad revenues (eMarketer, Inc., 2016f; comScore, 2016).

Social marketing is not without its disadvantages. Sometimes social media campaigns 
backfire. One problem is that brands lose a substantial amount of control over what 
people say about their brands (see the Insight on Society case, The Dark Side of Social 
Networks in Chapter 11 for a variety of examples) and also lose control over where their 
ads appear in terms of other content on social sites. Ads placed on Facebook accord-
ing to an algorithm can be placed near content that does not represent the values 
of the brand. This is not peculiar to social marketing, as advertising using Google’s 
advertising platform faces the same problem. This is very different, however, from 
TV ads where brands maintain near complete control. Social sites are unique in that 
disgruntled consumers, or just malicious people, can post material that is inaccurate 
and/or embarrassing (Vega and Kaufman, 2013).
The Insight on Society case, Marketing to Children of the Web in the Age of Social 
Networks, illustrates some additional issues with respect to social marketing.

MOBILE MARKETING 
Mobile marketing involves the use of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet 
computers to display banner ads, rich media, video, games, e-mail, text messaging, in-
store messaging, QuickResponse (QR) codes, and couponing. Mobile is now a required 
part of the standard marketing budget. Mobile devices represent a radical departure 
from previous marketing technologies simply because the devices integrate so many 
human and consumer activities from telephoning or texting friends, to listening to 
music, watching videos, tracking location, and shopping. The more mobile devices 
can do, the more people rely on them in daily life. More than 262 million Americans 
are now using mobile phones, while 207 million of these use smartphones. Over 168 
million Americans also use tablet computers (eMarketer, Inc., 2016f, 2016g, 2016h). 
One report found that people look at their mobile devices at least 40 times a day. Most 
mobile phone users keep their phone within arm’s length 24 hours a day. For many, 
it’s the first thing they check in the morning, the last thing they check at night, and 
the first tool to use when there’s a question of where to go, what to do, and where to 
meet up. 
OVERVIEW: M-COMMERCE TODAY
It’s a short number of steps from owning a smartphone or tablet, to searching for prod-
ucts and services, browsing, and then purchasing. The rate of growth of m-commerce 
has skyrocketed over the last several years, growing at over 30% annually, but is 
expected to moderate slightly to about 20% annual growth by 2020. Analysts estimate 
that by 2020, m-commerce will account for almost 50% of all e-commerce in the

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
MARKETING TO CHILDREN OF THE WEB IN THE 
AGE OF SOCIAL NETWORKS 
In the United States, over 99% of all 
5- to 15-year-olds use the Internet. 
Social and mobile marketing provides 
advertisers with an entirely new arsenal 
to influence children. Using custom banner 
ads, product characters, videos, games, virtual 
worlds, and surveys, marketers are both influ-
encing behaviors and gathering valuable data. A 
children’s digital culture has been created with 
built-in avenues to the psyche of young minds—
in some cases, minds that are so young they are 
unlikely to know when they are being marketed to 
and when they are being given misleading or even 
harmful information.
Marketers have moved aggressively to use 
social networks and viral marketing to get kids 
hooked on brands early in life. While such moves 
may be savvy marketing, are they ethical? Some 
people say no. Research has shown that young 
children cannot understand the potential effects 
of revealing their personal information; neither 
can they distinguish between substantive material 
on websites and the advertisements surrounding it. 
Experts argue that since children don’t understand 
persuasive intent until they are eight or nine years 
old, it is unethical to advertise to them before they 
can distinguish between advertising and the real 
world. Others believe that fair advertising is an 
important and necessary part of the maturation 
process for future adults in today’s society. 
In 1998, Congress passed the Children’s 
Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) after 
the FTC discovered that 80% of websites were 
collecting personal information from children, 
but only 1% required their parents’ permission. 
Under COPPA, companies must post a privacy 
policy on their websites, detailing exactly how they 
collect information from consumers, how they’ll 
use it, and the degrees to which they’ll protect 
consumer privacy. Companies are not permitted to 
use personal information collected from children 
under 13 years of age without the prior, verifiable 
consent of parents.
Since the law took effect, the FTC has 
obtained a number of settlements and fined a 
number of companies for violations of COPPA. For 
instance, Disney’s Playdom was fined $3 million, the 
largest penalty to date, for collecting and disclosing 
children’s information without parental approval. 
In 2011, the FTC announced its first-ever 
COPPA enforcement action involving mobile apps. 
Shortly thereafter, in response to the increase in 
the use of mobile devices by children, the FTC 
announced revisions to its COPPA regulations in 
an attempt to keep pace with emerging technology. 
The revisions, which took effect in 2013, expanded 
the definition of personal information to include a 
child’s location, along with any personal data col-
lected through the use of cookies for the purpose 
of targeted advertising. They also require that 
websites that collect a child’s information ensure 
that they can protect it, hold on to it for only as 
long as reasonably necessary, and thereafter delete 
the information. 
In 2016, the FTC more than doubled the 
maximum penalties that it levies for violations 
of COPPA and other consumer protection laws. 
If firms want to use the personal information of 
children for internal uses only, the FTC requires 
an e-mail from the parent plus one other form 
of verification (such as a credit card or phone 
number). The FTC now allows parents to take 
selfies to confirm parental consent in conjunction 
with facial recognition software. Firms seeking to 
sell personal information about children are also 
required to use an additional means of verification, 

	
M o b i l e  M a r k e t i n g  	 
459
such as a print-and-send consent form, credit card 
transaction, a toll-free number or video conference 
staffed by trained personnel, or verification of a 
parent’s identity by checking a form of government-
issued identification. Privacy groups applauded the 
effort, and enforcement of COPPA has improved. 
For example, in 2016, the FTC levied a fine of 
$950,000 against mobile advertising firm InMobi, 
alleging that the company tracked information 
and locations of hundreds of millions of children 
without consent and misrepresented the location 
tracking in its software as being opt-in when it 
was not. In addition to the fine, the FTC compelled 
InMobi to delete data collected without consent, 
implement a comprehensive privacy program, and 
be audited every two years for the next 20 years. 
In the past, the FTC had only used COPPA to 
regulate websites and app developers, as opposed 
to advertising networks like InMobi. Given that 
InMobi’s data collection policies are widespread 
in the advertising industry, the FTC could be much 
more active in 2017 and beyond. Individual states 
have also started enforcing COPPA regulations. 
In 2016, New York’s attorney general settled with 
Viacom, Mattel, Hasbro, and JumpStart Games 
over practices involving the collection of infor-
mation and online activities of children without 
parents’ consent, and Texas fined mobile app devel-
oper Juxta for similar practices. 
Major technology companies have also 
recently been fined and required to adjust their 
policies with regard to children signing up for 
their services. Google settled with the FTC 
in 2014 and agreed to refund $19 million 
worth of in-app purchases that were made 
unwittingly by children. Apple had also agreed 
to refund $32.5 million in similar purchases 
earlier in the year, and Amazon is likely to follow 
suit shortly. Yelp was hit with a $450,000 fine 
despite not having much vested interest in col-
lecting children’s information, and even game 
developers like TinyCo have fallen into the FTC 
crosshairs, incurring a $300,000 fine for violating 
children’s privacy. The question is whether these 
FTC fines will be enough to discourage companies 
from gathering valuable data on future consumers 
from such a young age. In 2015, Google released 
YouTube Kids, a child-friendly version of YouTube, 
but consumer advocates found that it still included 
inappropriate advertising and explicit content.
In 2015, the Senate launched a bipartisan 
effort to enact amendments to COPPA, which 
would include children ages 13 to 15 as well as 
the requirement of an “eraser button” that allows 
parents or children to permanently erase personal 
information online for any site collecting informa-
tion. However, thus far, the bill has not been passed. 
The FTC has also toughened its policies toward 
information gathering, forcing software and app 
makers to reconsider the inclusion of features 
that allow for data transfer between devices. App 
developers will also be required to verify paren-
tal consent using a credit or debit card number 
whether or not the app offers items for purchase.

retail and travel industries. Figure 7.6 illustrates the expected growth of mobile and 
“traditional” e-commerce in the retail and travel industries to 2020. 
Initially, m-commerce was focused primarily on digital goods, such as music, 
videos, games, and e-books. Today, however, traditional retail products and travel 
services are the source of much of the growth in m-commerce. Not surprisingly, the 
giant in the United States is Amazon, with over $17 billion in sales through its mobile 
website and Amazon app. According to a recent survey, around 45% of shopping trips 
also include some mobile shopping (eMarketer, Inc., 2016m).
Increasingly, consumers are using their mobile devices to search for people, 
places, and things—like restaurants and deals on products they saw in a retail store. 
The rapid switch of consumers from desktop platforms to mobile devices is driving a 
surge in mobile marketing expenditures. Because search is so important for directing 
consumers to purchase situations, the mobile search advertising market is very impor-
tant for search engines like Google and Bing. Desktop search revenues are slowing for 
both. Google’s mobile ad business is growing rapidly, but the prices it can charge for 
mobile ads are far less than for desktop computer ads. The challenge facing Google 
and other mobile marketing firms is how to get more consumers to click on mobile 
ads, and how to charge marketers more for each click. And the answer lies with the 
consumer who decides what and when to click. 
How People Actually Use Mobile Devices
If you plan a mobile marketing campaign, it’s important to understand how people 
actually use their mobile devices (which may be different from what you do or think 
others do). For instance, most of us think people use their mobile devices on the go, 
but in fact, according to one of the very few studies of actual mobile behavior, almost 
70% of all mobile minutes actually occur in the home. We know people spend about

5 hours and 45 minutes with digital media on average daily, and over three of these 
hours is spent using mobile devices—smartphones and tablets. What are they doing 
in these three hours, and on what device? 
Recent data show that entertainment, not shopping or buying, is the primary focus 
(at least in terms of time) for mobile device users. Of the three hours (180 minutes) a 
day that people are spending using their mobile devices, 29 minutes (16%) is spent on 
social networks. Watching video accounts for 29 minutes as well (16%). A whopping 47 
minutes (26%) is spent listening to music, primarily streaming music services. Hence, 
42% of mobile device use is for entertainment (music and video), with social networks 
consuming another 16% (eMarketer, Inc., 2016n). Where else does the time go? A 
survey by Pew Research Center described the broad range of activities that mobile 
users accomplish on their mobile devices when they are not entertaining themselves 
or socializing. People use the mobile devices for pretty much the same activities as 
they do their desktop computers, from getting information, to banking, and looking 
for places to live. Unfortunately, this survey did not include data on shopping and 
purchasing behavior, and did not include information on time spent with the activity 
(Pew Research Center, 2015). 
However, a National Federation of Retailers survey provides insight into how con-
sumers planned to use their mobile devices and which ones—tablet or smartphone—in 
the 2015 holiday shopping season (Figure 7.7). Researching products and comparing

prices topped the list, with tablets (47%) leading smartphones (37%) as a vehicle for 
purchase. However, a very large percentage (35%–40%) did not plan to use either a 
tablet or a smartphone for shopping or buying at all. Only around one-third of tablet 
users and less than 25% of smartphone users planned to purchase anything with their 
tablets or smartphones (National Retail Federation, 2015). 
From this research, we can conclude that mobile devices are still primarily used 
for entertainment, socializing, and communicating, with less time spent using them for 
shopping or buying. None of these patterns are permanent, however. M-commerce is 
surging. Initial expectations were that tablets would provide the primary m-commerce 
platform, but that has not proven to be the case. As the size of smartphone screens 
has grown and their resolution improved, coupled with better mobile search, better 
location- and context-based discovery, and better mobile payment systems, the smart-
phone buying experience has improved, resulting in rapidly growing smartphone 
m-commerce sales (Figure 7.8).
In-App Experiences and In-App Ads
You may think that using a browser to access the Web on your smartphone or tablet is 
a typical mobile activity. In reality, however, mobile users spend almost 60% of their 
Contrary to earlier expectations, retail m-commerce sales on smartphones are increasing at a much faster 
rate than those on tablet computers.

total digital time using apps. Smartphone apps in particular have been the biggest 
driver in the growth in digital media usage, and they account for almost half of total 
digital time, as well as almost 75% of the time spent on mobile devices, and 85% of 
the time spent on mobile apps. Time spent on tablet apps is declining, in contrast, as 
smartphone screens increase in both size and resolution. On average, users use only 
about 27 apps a month on their smartphones. Almost 75% of all app time is spent on 
a user’s top three apps. There may be millions of apps on the iOS and Android cloud 
servers, but just a handful are actually generating sufficient user traffic to be of interest 
to general advertisers. Facebook is the top app both in audience size and share of time 
spent, followed by Facebook Messenger in second place. Google has four of the top 
seven apps (Google Maps, Google Search, Google Play, and Gmail). Most of the other 
apps in the top 25 are either social networks (Instagram, Snapchat, Pinterest, and 
Twitter), entertainment-oriented (Pandora Radio, Apple Music, Netflix, and Spotify), or 
utilities (Apple Maps, Google Drive, Yahoo Stocks, The Weather Channel, Yahoo Mail). 
There are only four retail-oriented apps in the top 25: Amazon Mobile (10th), Groupon 
(22nd), Walmart (23rd), and eBay (24th). However, many of the fastest growing apps 
in terms of unique visitors are those from on-demand service providers, such as Uber 
and Lyft (comScore, 2016). 
The implications for marketers are quite clear: if consumers are primarily using 
apps rather than browsing the Web on their mobile devices, marketers need to place 
ads in apps where most of the action is for attracting consumers, and that means social 
network and entertainment apps. Second, if mobile consumers only use, on average, 
27 apps, then marketers need to concentrate their marketing in these popular apps, 
let’s say, the top 100. Niche marketers, on the other hand, can concentrate their ads 
in apps that support that niche. A distributor of diving equipment, for instance, could 
place ads in apps devoted to the diving community. There may not be many users of 
the app, but those who do use it are highly motivated on the topic. 
Another implication for marketers is that rather than focus on mobile display ads 
that are difficult to read, the best ad may be an entertaining video ad that captures 
the viewer’s attention or an ad in an app that is precisely targeted to the consumer’s 
current activities and interests. 
How the Multi-Screen Environment Changes the Marketing Funnel
Along with the growth of smartphones and tablets comes a multi-screen world: smart-
phones, tablets, desktops, and television. The reality, and the future, of computing 
devices is that consumers will be multi-platform: using desktops and laptops at work 
and home, and smartphones and tablets at home as well as when moving about. 
Television will be available all the time, both at home and on the go via tablets and 
smartphones. Consumer purchasing behavior changes in a multi-screen world. Con-
sumers will often be using two or more screens at once, tweeting when watching a TV 
show, or moving seamlessly from a TV ad, to a mobile search for more information, to 
a later tablet purchase screen. Several research studies have found that 90% of multi-
device users switch among screens to complete tasks, for instance, viewing an ad on 
TV, searching on a smartphone for the product, and then purchasing it with a tablet. 
Consumers move seamlessly among devices, either sequentially or simultaneously. 

464	
	
C H A P T E R  7     S o c i a l ,  M o b i l e ,  a n d  L o c a l  M a r k e t i n g
Also, the more screens people use, the more shopping and purchasing they do. One 
conclusion is that the more screens consumers have, the more consumer touchpoints 
or marketing opportunities exist (Google, Inc., 2012). 
The implications of the multi-device platform, or screen diversity environment, 
are that marketing needs to be designed for whatever device the consumer is using, 
and consistent branding across platforms will be important. Screen diversity means 
that one ad size, for instance, will not fit all situations, and that branding images will 
need to be adjusted automatically based on the device the consumer is using. From a 
design perspective, graphics and creative elements will appear differently depending 
on the screen. This is called responsive design or responsive creative design. Respon-
sive design is a design process that allows your marketing content to resize, reformat, 
and reorganize itself so that it looks good on any screen. You can see responsive design 
in action if you look at any portal on a desktop, and then compare the screen to that 
same portal viewed on a smartphone or tablet. You are likely to find there are three 
versions of the screen, one for each platform (IAB, 2012). The requirement to find 
customers on multiple screens can add considerably to the cost of marketing online. 
Companies need to develop a presence and market not only on websites, but on mobile 
websites, and/or smartphone and tablet apps as well. Perhaps they may not be able to 
afford all three of these, and may want to choose only one. In that case, which is the 
best? Much depends on what the point of the marketing is. To drive sales, a website 
might be more effective, but to drive brand awareness, and engagement, social and 
entertainment apps might be better (eMarketer, Inc., 2015c).
But even beyond screen adaptability, a multi-screen world means merchants need 
to be on all platforms, and to be integrated across platforms, in order to send a coherent 
message and to create a convenient consumer platform. The marketing environment 
today is much more complex than placing banner ads on pages or on search engine 
results pages on the Web. 
BASIC MOBILE MARKETING FEATURES 
As millions of consumers adopt mobile devices, mobile marketing expenditures have 
rapidly grown and in 2015, exceeded the amount spent on advertising on the desktop 
platform for the first time. This trend is expected to continue through 2020 (see Figure 
7.9). In 2016, mobile marketing will be about 64% of all online marketing, which is 
extraordinary given that smartphones appeared only nine years ago in 2007, and 
tablets not until 2010. Analysts believe that if current mobile marketing growth rates 
continue, by 2020, mobile marketing will be over 75% of all online advertising and 
over twice as large as desktop advertising. 
Mobile advertising is dominated by Google, with an expected $14.7 billion in 
mobile ad revenues in 2016, constituting about 32% of the entire market, but down 
from 40% in 2014 as Facebook and others continue to expand into the mobile market. 
On the mobile platform, Google is still the king of search, generating an expected $12.7 
billion from mobile search ads in 2016, almost two-thirds of all mobile search ad spend-
ing. Facebook is second in mobile ads with an expected $10.1 billion in revenue from 
mobile ads in 2016, about 22% of total mobile ad revenues. Just as Google dominates in 
mobile search ads, Facebook dominates in mobile display ads, accounting for over 42% 

	
M o b i l e  M a r k e t i n g  	 
465
of all spending on such ads. Other players in the mobile marketing marketplace are 
Twitter (with a 2.6% share), Yahoo (2.3%), and Pandora, with 1.8% (see Figure 7.10). 
The Technology: Basic Mobile Device Features
Everybody knows the capabilities of smartphones and tablets. But what is it about 
mobile platforms that make them any different from desktops? What features make 
them especially suitable for marketing? 
For starters, smartphones today play a much more central role in the personal 
life of consumers than desktops and laptops in large part because smartphones are 
always physically with us, or close by. In this sense, they are more personal, and 
almost “wearable.” The “always on, always with us” nature of smartphones has several 
implications for marketers. Because they are perceived as “personal appendages,” 
consumers are less tolerant of commercial intrusion. Have you ever had a telephone 
conversation interrupted by an advertisement? You probably have not, and if so, 
you most likely would be annoyed at the interference with a personal conversation. 
These attitudes extend to any use of the phone or tablet, from reading e-mail, visiting 
Facebook, or watching a video. Consumers are simply less tolerant of advertising on 
the small screens of smartphones. Second, the around-the-clock physical proximity of 
smartphones to our persons greatly expands the time available for marketing materi-
als and increases the supply of screens for marketing materials. This excess supply 
Spending on mobile marketing is growing much more rapidly than spending on advertising aimed at 
desktop computers, which is actually declining. By 2020, it is expected that advertisers will be spending 
more than three times as much on mobile marketing than desktop marketing.

decreases the price of mobile marketing messages. In turn, there is a tension between 
marketers and consumers: marketers want to increase the number of mobile ads, 
while consumers want to see fewer ads, not more, on their mobile devices. Ads inside 
apps are treated differently by consumers: in return for a free game, consumers are 
more accepting of ads. 
But perhaps the most unique feature of smartphones is that they know users’ 
precise location by virtue of their built-in GPS. This allows marketing messages to be 
targeted to consumers on the basis of their location, and supports the introduction of 
location-based marketing and local marketing (described in Section 7.4). While web-
sites may know a desktop’s general location, it is a very imprecise fix, and the position 
of the desktop does not change as the user moves about. Table 7.13 summarizes the 
features of mobile devices that marketers can leverage.
MOBILE MARKETING TOOLS: AD FORMATS 
Unlike social marketing, mobile marketing does not require much of a new marketing 
vocabulary. All the marketing formats available on the desktop are also available on 
mobile devices. With few exceptions, mobile marketing is very much like desktop 
marketing—except it is smaller. The major marketing opportunities in mobile mar-
keting are search ads, display ads, videos and rich media, messaging (SMS/MMS/
PPS), and some familiar other formats like e-mail, classified, and lead generation.  
Figure 7.11 illustrates the relative size of mobile marketing expenditures by format. 
The marketing formats on mobile devices are search ads, display (banners, rich 
media, and sponsorships), video, text/video messaging, and other (including e-mail, 
classifieds, and lead generation).

In 2016, search engine advertising continues to be the most popular mobile mar-
keting format, accounting for almost 45% of all mobile ad spending, not surprising 
given that search is the second most common smartphone application (after voice and 
text communication). Search engine ads can be further optimized for the mobile plat-
form by showing ads based on the physical location of the user. Display ads (banner

ads, rich media, and sponsorships) are the second leading ad format, accounting for 
about 42% of mobile ad spending. Display ads can be served as a part of a mobile 
website or inside apps and games. Ad networks such as Google’s AdMob, Facebook, 
Apple’s iAd, Twitter’s MoPub, and MillennialMedia are some of the largest providers 
of mobile display advertising. Video ads are only about 10% of mobile marketing, but 
are a fast growing segment because of their very high click rates. Most desktop video 
ads can be resized for use on mobile phones and tablets. Mobile messaging generally 
involves SMS text messaging to consumers, with coupons or flash marketing messages. 
Messaging is especially effective for local advertising because consumers can be sent 
messages and coupons as they pass by or visit locations (see Section 7.4). 
Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest have generally 
brought their desktop advertising techniques over to the mobile platform, with some 
alterations of the interface for use on small-screen smartphones. In the process, social 
networks have brought real innovation to the mobile marketing experience, including 
News Feed posts on Facebook and Promoted Tweets in Twitter. Table 7.14 provides 
selected examples of mobile marketing campaigns and techniques used by several 
well-known firms. 
Mobile marketing is uniquely suited for branding purposes, raising awareness 
through the use of video and rich interactive media such as games. Read the Insight 
on Business case, Mobile Marketing: Ford Goes 3-D, for a further look.
STARTING A MOBILE MARKETING CAMPAIGN
As with all marketing campaigns, start by identifying your objectives and understand-
ing just how a mobile marketing campaign might help your firm. Are you a new 
unknown startup seeking to develop a brand image, or an already existing brand 
looking to strengthen your presence and sell products? Is there something about your 
products that makes them especially attractive to a mobile audience? For instance, if 
you sell to local customers walking by your shop, then you might want to use the GPS 
capabilities of smartphones to target consumers who are nearby.

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
MOBILE MARKETING: FORD GOES 3-D
Why is mobile marketing any differ-
ent from ordinary online marketing? 
In one sense, it isn’t. You’ll find the 
same kinds of ad formats on mobile 
devices that are used on websites—
search, display, video, and text messages. 
On the other hand, the built-in features of the 
smartphone, such as GPS, gyroscope, and accel-
erometer, can enable mobile marketers to be 
much more creative. Not only can marketers use 
the location of users to market local businesses, 
but they can also take advantage of the touch 
interface to serve rich media and video ads that 
are much more engaging and interactive than 
traditional desktop computer ads. Other unique 
smartphone features are that people almost 
always carry them and keep them turned on. This 
means that smartphone users can be exposed to 
marketing messages at nearly any time. 
Mobile devices are used by consumers 
throughout the purchase cycle: About half of the 
population uses a mobile device to research prod-
ucts online before purchasing. The use of mobile 
devices to actually purchase products or services 
online (as opposed to just shopping and browsing 
online) is growing significantly. Mobile shopping 
is particularly easy on sites that have one-click 
shopping capability and for content like books 
and movies. Also, for local marketing, mobile is an 
ideal platform for merchants to attract consum-
ers in the neighborhood. Restaurants, museums, 
and entertainment venues are ideal candidates to 
use mobile marketing aimed at local consumers. 
What attracts users to mobile purchasing is the 
ability to immediately access product information, 
find deals, and buy products, all with the swipe 
of a finger. But mobile is also good for introduc-
ing new products and building brand recognition, 
with sales taking place elsewhere and offline. 
Programmatic advertising, where the purchasing 
of ads is automated and ads are served to highly 
targeted demographics, is also much easier on 
mobile, where advertisers know much more about 
their audiences than on a platform like television. 
Programmatic advertising comprised nearly 80% 
of mobile display ad spending in 2016.
One increasingly popular method of mobile 
advertising among companies with big advertis-
ing budgets is 3-D advertising, which consists of 
advertisements with video and other interactive 
features that take advantage of the capabilities 
of modern mobile devices. A good example of 
this type of advertising in action is Ford’s “We 
Own Work” campaign for its F-150 pickup truck, 
America’s top selling truck for 36 years. Ford used 
a 3-D mobile advertisement for the 2014 edition 
of the truck as the centerpiece and “lead creative 
unit” in the campaign, with the stated goals that 
the ad be innovative, creative, and compatible with 
all major platforms and devices. They hoped to 
simulate a showroom experience within the ad, 
building brand awareness and user engagement 
in the process.
Ford’s advertising team partnered with 
Amobee, a three-dimensional mobile advertising 
platform, to create the virtual showroom experi-
ence. The ad displays as a motion-sensitive banner 
ad that expands across the screen into a full 3-D 
virtual showroom, complete with fully customiz-
able options for the displayed F-150, embedded 
videos, and a 360-degree view of the vehicle. Users 
can change the truck to one of fourteen colors 
with a quick tap of the screen, and can view the 
F-150 in different environments at any angle by 
moving their device. The environments are intended 
to show the F-150 in action performing a wide 
array of functions, including construction, hauling, 
farming, and transporting hazardous materials. 
Users can also tap the screen to load the bed of 
the virtual F-150, showcasing its payload capacity.

C H A P T E R  7     S o c i a l ,  M o b i l e ,  a n d  L o c a l  M a r k e t i n g
By tilting the mobile device in any direction, 
users can generate reflections of each environ-
ment in the mirrors and windows of the truck via 
the accelerometer of the device. 
Unlike traditional rich media ads, 3-D mobile 
ads respond to users’ actions in real time, chang-
ing colors, lighting, shading, and other features. 
But the 3-D ad format offered by Amobee is 
actually a more light-weight and user-friendly 
package than traditional HTML5 rich media ads, 
since the ads take advantage of many features 
that are used from the phone itself, whereas users 
must download all of the features used by a rich 
media ad. Amobee advertisements use WebGL to 
render interactive 3-D graphics, which allow each 
ad to run on traditional web browsers as well as 
an extensive array of mobile devices, and some 
ads now use 3-D Touch technology to allow users 
to perform different tasks by applying different 
levels of pressure to their touch screen. In 2016, 
Amobee launched an updated set of ad formats 
and ad creation tools called Amobee Impact, and 
prominent brands such as PayPal, Red Bull, and 
Lexus have partnered with Amobee on mobile 
campaigns.
Amobee also touts that its advertising plat-
form can identify and target individual demo-
graphics at scale. Amobee can keep track of 
engagement with its advertisements in real time, 
keeping consumers anonymous but measuring 
how much time different demographics of users 
spend with individual elements of each ad and how 
effectively ads engage each type of user. Amobee 
has an in-house data management platform with 
over a million profiles with customer information 
such as gender, age, location, and interests. Need-
less to say, this capability is extremely useful when 
measuring the effectiveness of an advertising 
campaign, and when a brand like Ford is seeking 
to target specific types of consumers.
Ford rolled out the ad in conjunction with 
the launch of the F-150. Using Amobee analytics, 
Ford determined that the F-150 3-D ad registered 
20 million impressions and 595,000 expansions. 
The 2.9% rate of expansions was 4.6 times the 
industry average, and the 13% overall engagement 
rate was twice as high as the industry average. 
Metrics also indicated that the 3-D mobile cam-
paign generated an increase in brand favorability 
by 19.9%, an increase in purchase consideration 
by 40.4%, and an increase in brand awareness of 
the F-150 and Ford by 11.4%. The ad generated a 
71.1% association by consumers of the “We Own 
Work” slogan with Ford.
Amobee requires a minimum investment 
of $250,000 for a month-long 3-D advertising 
campaign, so currently this style of ad is avail-
able mostly to bigger brands. Retail brands with 
physical products are great fits for 3-D ads, but 
companies offering services such as financial insti-
tutions may never be interested in 3-D ads. And 
while these ads currently offer impressive engage-
ment rates, when their novelty wears off and they 
become more commonplace, those numbers may 
come back to earth a bit. Still, the trend toward 
3-D advertising is undeniable. Facebook users 
could see similar posts from brands as a result 
of its $2 billion purchase of VR app developer 
Oculus Rift, and Ford was so encouraged by its 
F-150 campaign that they ran a similar one for 
the 2015 Mustang. With 3-D advertising, consum-
ers can explore products in greater detail than ever 
before, at their own pace and with an emphasis on 
interactivity and fun. It could be closer than ever 
to a marketer’s holy grail: advertising that doesn’t 
feel like advertising.

Next, consider the target demographic for your campaign and products. The most 
active purchasers on mobile devices are men, and they are more likely to buy con-
sumer electronics equipment and digital content. Women are more likely to cash in 
coupons and respond to flash sales and deals. Younger consumers are more likely 
to research products and price on mobile devices, and more likely to share experi-
ences using social media. Mobile shoppers and buyers are more affluent than the 
online population in general. These demographics are averages, and mobile marketing 
campaigns do not need to restrict themselves to these averages. Find out where your 
mobile customers are congregating. Are your mobile customers likely to be using apps, 
and if so, what are they? Are your customers likely to be on Facebook or use Twitter? 
Or are your customers most likely to find you on a Google mobile search page? 
Finally, consider the marketspace where you hope to succeed. What are your 
competitors doing on the mobile platform? Is their presence effective? Where do they 
place their marketing efforts: display ads on web portals, or display ads in Google 
search results? Or can they be found as in-app ads? What apps are they advertising 
in? How are they represented on Facebook Mobile? Do they also have a Twitter and/
or Pinterest brand page? Do your competitors have an app that users can easily down-
load? You’ll want to be able to meet your competitors on each of the platforms they 
have adopted. Once you’ve developed an initial vision for your marketing campaign, 
you can develop a timeline and an action plan of how to meet the milestones identi-
fied in your timeline. 
Once you have envisioned your marketing campaign and identified your market, 
it is time to start implementing your mobile campaign. Here are some steps to follow:
•	 Develop a mobile website so mobile consumers can see and buy your products. 
Make your mobile website social by including Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and 
other social site links. 
•	 Develop a Facebook brand page so your social and mobile marketing efforts are 
integrated.
•	 Develop a Twitter brand page so customers can follow your posts.
•	 If you already use a display advertising program like Google’s AdWords or a Face-
book display ad account, you can create a new campaign using the same ads 
designed specifically for mobile platforms. 
•	 Consider opening an iAd account and using Apple’s iAd network or Google’s AdMob 
in part because these ad networks can publish and track your ads on multiple 
platforms simultaneously.
•	 Develop marketing content that is aimed specifically at the mobile user, with videos 
and high levels of interactivity designed for the mobile screen. 
•	 Measure and manage your campaign. Apple’s iAd and Google’s AdWords, along with 
many other ad networks, will host and manage your mobile campaigns. In addition, 
they can provide you with a host of campaign measures that will allow you to see 
which mobile ads and techniques are attracting the most followers, comments, and 
social activity concerning your brand. With this basic data you can start to manage 
the mobile marketing campaign by reducing expenditures on ads that do not work 
and increasing the budget of ads that do work.

MEASURING MOBILE MARKETING RESULTS
There are many different mobile marketing objectives, and therefore different types 
of mobile marketing campaigns. Some campaigns are sales-oriented, based on display 
and search ads, offering coupons or discounts, and taking users directly to a website 
where they can buy something. Measuring the results of these mobile campaigns 
follows similar campaigns launched on desktops. Other campaigns focus on branding, 
where the objective is to engage consumers in a conversation, acquire them as fans, 
and spread the word among their friends. You can use the framework from Figure 
7.5 on page 431 to measure the results of these campaigns. The key dimensions to 
measure for mobile social campaigns are fan acquisition, engagement, amplification, 
community, brand strength (center of conversation), and sales. 
Figure 7.12 illustrates how a brand-oriented marketing campaign utilizing the 
mobile platform and social marketing might present its effectiveness measures over 
a six-month period. In a branding campaign, the object is not so much sales as it is 
strengthening consumers’ engagement with the brand. In the example provided in 
Figure 7.12, acquiring fans is measured by the number of unique visitors. Here you 
can see that over six months, visitors have risen over 60%. Engagement is reflected in 
the time on-site (in thousands of minutes); amplification is measured by the number 
of Likes, and this has expanded threefold. Community is measured by the number of 
The effectiveness of a branding campaign utilizing the mobile platform and social marketing can be 
measured by examining the number of Likes, posts, page views, time on site, and unique visitors.

CAMPAIGN 

posts, suggesting fans are actively engaging with one another and the brand. Posts have 
risen eightfold in the period. Brand strength is best summarized in this figure as the 
composite picture of fan acquisition, engagement, amplification, and community mea-
sures. Measuring the impacts of this mobile campaign on ultimate sales requires going 
a step further and measuring which sales can be attributed to this mobile campaign. 
	  7.4 	 LOCAL AND LOCATION-BASED MOBILE MARKETING 
Location-based marketing is one of the fastest growing segments of the digital market-
ing universe. Location-based marketing targets marketing messages to users based 
on their location. Generally, location-based marketing involves marketing of location-
based services. Location-based services involve providing services to users based on 
their location. Examples of location-based services are: personal navigation (How do 
I get there?), point-of-interest (What’s that?), reviews (What’s the best restaurant in 
the neighborhood?), friend-finder (Where are you? Where’s the crowd?), and family-
tracker services (Where is my child?). There is a connection, of course: the more 
people use their mobile devices to search for and obtain local services, the more 
opportunities there are for marketers to target consumers with messages at just the 
right moment, at just the right location, and in just the right way—not too pushy and 
annoying, but in a way to improve the consumer experience at the moment of local 
shopping and buying. This is the ideal in any event. Location-based marketing can 
take place on a desktop as well because browsers and marketers know your approxi-
mate location. But in this section we focus primarily on location-based mobile market-
ing, which is where the greatest growth and opportunities lie. 
Experience and market research suggest that consumers want local ads, offers, 
information, and content. Consumers have a high likelihood of acting on local ads and 
purchasing the products and services offered. Because it has evolved so rapidly in the 
last five years, experience and research with respect to location-based marketing is a 
work in progress with many different platforms, providers, and techniques. Measures 
of effectiveness and returns on investment are being developed. 
THE GROWTH OF LOCAL MARKETING
Prior to the release of Google Maps in 2005, nearly all local advertising was nondigital 
and provided by local newspapers, radio and television stations, local yellow pages, and 
billboards. Of course, some was digital, involving the websites of local merchants. In 
2016, total media ad spending in the United States is $196 billion, and approximately 
$146 billion of this is local media spending by both national and local brands. An 
estimated 40% of this local advertising (about $58 billion) involves truly local firms like 
restaurants, grocery stores, theaters, and shoe stores marketing to their local audience. 
The remaining 60% of local media marketing involves large national firms marketing 
to local audiences, such as an ad for Coca-Cola in a local newspaper or websites created 
for local auto dealers by national firms. Of the $146 billion of local media spending, 
about 31% ($45 billion) will be spent on online marketing, and this amount is expected 
to grow to about $72 billion by 2020 (BIA/Kelsey, 2016).

After the introduction of Google Maps in 2005 and smartphones in 2007, online 
local marketing began to rapidly expand. Google Maps on desktop computers enabled 
the targeting of ads to users based on a general sense of their IP address and enabled 
merchants to display ads to users based on the general location of potential customers, 
usually within a several square-mile radius. IP addresses can be used to identify a city, 
and a neighborhood within the city, but not a zip code, street, or building. Google Maps 
helped users answer the question “Where can I find an Italian restaurant” in a city or 
section of a city from their desktop. The arrival of smartphones in 2007, and Google’s 
mobile maps app, took this one step further. The GPS receivers in second-generation 
smartphones introduced in 2008 (Apple’s 3G iPhone), along with other techniques, 
meant that a user’s location (latitude and longitude) could be fairly well known by 
cell phone manufacturers, marketers, service providers, and carriers like AT&T and 
Verizon. These developments opened an entirely new growth path for local online 
advertising that heretofore had been confined to the desktop. In this new world, a 
local food market could shout out to mobile phone users as they walked by the store, 
offering discounts to responders, and users in turn could search for specific retail stores 
nearby, even checking their inventory before walking into the store. 
THE GROWTH OF LOCATION-BASED (LOCAL) MOBILE MARKETING
Location-based (local) mobile marketing is currently a small part of the online market-
ing environment, but it is expected to triple over the next 5 years. Figure 7.13 helps 
put the location-based mobile market in perspective. In 2016, total online marketing 
will be about $72 billion and local online marketing is expected to be a healthy and 
surprisingly large $45 billion. The part of local online that is location-based mobile is 
expected to generate an estimated $12.8 billion.
	 FIGURE 7.13

The ad formats used in local mobile marketing are familiar—search ads, display, 
native/social, videos, and SMS text messages. Search ads displayed as a part of user 
search results comprise the largest location-based mobile ad format, with marketers 
expected to spend an estimated $7.3 billion in 2016. The local mobile search market 
is dominated by Google. Social/native ads are the second largest format, generating 
an estimated $2.5 billion in 2016. Display ads are the third largest format, and are 
expected to account for about $2.2 billion in spending in 2016. Here the main players 
are Facebook and Google. Together, Google and Facebook account for vast majority 
of location-based mobile marketing. Figure 7.14 illustrates the relative shares of 
location-based mobile ad format spending in 2015 (BIA/Kelsey, 2015a).
LOCATION-BASED MARKETING PLATFORMS
The key players in location-based mobile marketing are the same giants who dominate 
the mobile marketing environment described in a previous section, namely, Google, 
Facebook, Apple, Twitter, YP (formerly Yellow Pages), Pandora, and Millennial Media. 
Google is clearly the leading location-based marketer largely because of its widely 
used Google Maps app on smartphones. When a consumer searches for a location on 
Google Maps, it is an ideal marketing moment to pop an ad before the consumer’s 
eyes. Google Places is a simple but effective service that provides short business 
profiles when users search for a specific business. Google’s Android operating system 
has location functionality built into the system, and Google apps, like Google Maps, 
continuously update the user’s location. Google purchased a mobile advertising firm 
called AdMob in 2009 and claims to be the world’s largest mobile advertising firm for 
both Android and Apple’s iOS operating systems. App developers use AdMob to provide 
their apps with consumer and user location information. Google also sells location 
information to independent marketing firms. Marketing firms use AdMob to develop 
Search is the leading location-based mobile ad format.

full-screen rich media ads. Google’s main revenue stream comes from its AdWords 
service, where marketers bid for keywords on Google’s search engine. AdWords used 
to be the same whether displayed on a desktop computer or a mobile device. Google 
has upgraded its AdWords service to optimize ads for user contexts and devices, and 
to provide management of campaigns across all mobile and desktop devices. The new 
service is called Enhanced AdWords. For instance, if a customer searches for “pizza” on 
a desktop computer from work at 1 PM, he or she would be shown restaurants nearby 
and a quick order form. If the customer searched for “pizza” at 8 PM on a smartphone 
within a half-mile of a pizza restaurant, he or she might be shown a click-to-call phone 
number and directions to the restaurant. Pizza restaurants pay Google for the chance 
to show up in these searches. 
Google and Apple have advantages in the location-based market: they both have 
developed extensive maps of Wi-Fi networks throughout the world, allowing them to 
develop much more precise location information than competitors. 
Apple’s mobile platform iAd provides location data to iOS app developers and 
mobile marketing firms. Like AdMob, when users click on an iAd ad, a full-screen ad 
appears within the app they are using. The ad can be targeted to the user’s location. 
LOCATION-BASED MOBILE MARKETING: THE TECHNOLOGIES
Location-based services and marketing require marketers and local service providers 
to have a fairly precise idea of where consumer mobile devices are located. There are 
two general types of location-based marketing techniques: geo-aware and proximity 
marketing. Geo-aware techniques identify the location of a user’s device and then 
target marketing to the device, recommending actions within reach (which, in itself, 
requires the marketer to know where relevant things like stores are located). For 
instance, a marketer may target smartphones within several square city blocks to alert 
them to available offers from participating merchants. Proximity marketing tech-
niques identify a perimeter around a physical location, and then target ads to users 
within that perimeter, recommending actions possible within the fenced-in area. The 
perimeter can be from hundreds of feet (in urban areas) to several miles (in suburban 
locations). For instance, if users walk into the geo-fenced perimeter of a store, restau-
rant, or retail shop, they will receive ads from these businesses. Both of these tech-
niques utilize the same locating technologies.
Ad networks, local-mobile marketing firms, providers of devices and services like 
Google and Apple, as well as phone companies use several methods for locating mobile 
devices, none of which are perfect, and all of which have varying degrees of accuracy. 
Table 7.15 describes the major locating technologies used to enable location-based 
services and marketing. 
GPS (Global Positioning System) location is the most accurate positioning method 
in theory. In practice, the signal can be weak in urban areas, nonexistent inside 
buildings, signals can be deflected, and it can take a long time (30–60 seconds) for 
the device to acquire the signal and calculate a position. When a clear signal is 
obtained, GPS can be accurate to within 3–10 meters under ideal conditions, but more 
frequently, a cell phone’s GPS is accurate only to within 50 meters—half a football

ical location, and then 
target ads to users within 
that perimeter, recom-

field. Also, users have to activate the feature, and many do not for privacy reasons. 
Assisted GPS (A-GPS) supplements GPS information with other information from the 
phone network to speed up acquisition. Nearly all smartphones use A-GPS. In Apple’s 
iOS, users can decide whether to turn Location Services on or off. When turned on, 
the iOS uses GPS, cellular, and Wi-Fi networks to determine the user’s approximate 
location to within 10 meters (30 feet) although in many situations accuracy can be 
much higher, around 15 feet. The user’s iPhone continuously reports its position and 
reports to Apple servers. 
Cell tower location is used by wireless telephone carriers to track the location 
of their devices, which is required to complete phone calls as devices pass from the 
range of one tower into the range of another. Cell tower location is also the basis of 
the wireless emergency response system in the United States. The FCC’s wireless 
Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) rules require wireless carriers to track cellphone locations 
whether or not the user has turned on location services in order to assist emergency 
responders in locating users who make 911 calls.
Wi-Fi location is used in conjunction with GPS signals to more accurately locate 
a user based on the known location of Wi-Fi transmitters, which are fairly ubiquitous 
in urban and suburban locations. Apple, Google, and other mobile service providers 
have developed global databases of wireless access points simply by driving cars 
around urban areas in much of the world. Google uses Street View cars to build a

Estimates user’s location within a radius of a known Wi-Fi 
access point.
Bluetooth low energy (BLE)
Used by Apple in iBeacon. Uses less battery power than 
traditional Bluetooth or GPS and more accurate than targeting 
through Wi-Fi triangulation.
Geo-search 
Uses location information based on the user’s search queries.
Cell tower 
AT&T, Verizon, and other carriers are in constant contact with 
their devices, which allows approximation of location by 
triangulation and refinement of the unit’s GPS location. 
Wireless carriers use a cell phone’s MAC address to identify 
the phone and the location. 
Sign in/registration
Estimates users’ location when they self-identify their location 
using sign-in services or social network posts.

global database of wireless access points and their geographic location. Android 
applications can use this database to determine the approximate location of individu-
als based on the Wi-Fi networks detected by their mobile devices. All Wi-Fi devices 
continuously monitor the presence of local Wi-Fi networks, and mobile devices 
report back this data to Apple and Microsoft, along with other device manufacturers, 
who use similar methods. The goal of these technologies is to provide consumers 
and marketers with “micro-location data” accurate to within a few feet to support 
truly real-time, accurate, local marketing at the personal level. For instance, if you 
are looking at a rack of dress shirts in a retail store, an accurate positioning system 
could detect this, and direct you to appropriate accessories like socks and ties on 
surrounding shelves. 
WHY IS LOCAL MOBILE ATTRACTIVE TO MARKETERS?
Consumers who seek information about local businesses using mobile devices are 
much more active and ready to purchase than desktop users. In part this is because 
desktop searchers for local information are not in as close proximity to merchants as 
are mobile searchers. A recent Google survey found that over 80% of U.S. consumers 
use smartphones and tablet computers to conduct local searches on search engines 
for a variety of local information such as business hours, local store addresses 
and directions, and availability of products at local stores. The survey found that 
consumers search for local information through the purchase process, and 50% of 
smartphone users visited a store within a day of their local search, and 18% made 
a purchase within a day. The survey also found that over 60% of smartphone users 
wanted ads customized both to their city/zip code and to their immediate surround-
ings (Google, 2014a). 
LOCATION-BASED MARKETING TOOLS
Location-based digital marketing, like social marketing, presents students of digital 
marketing with a confusing array of new services, platforms, and firms that provide 
these services. While some local-based marketing techniques, like placing ads on 
Google’s AdSense platform aimed at mobile customers, are relatively easy to establish 
for the small business owner, others require the help of mobile marketing provider 
firms. 
A New Lexicon: Location-Based Digital Marketing Features 
Location-based services involve providing services to users based on their location. 
Examples include personal navigation, point-of-interest, reviews, friend-finder, and 
family-tracker services. Table 7.16 describes how some of these features can be used 
for marketing.
Proximity Marketing with Beacons 
While all location-based marketing is in some sense proximity marketing, when 
Apple introduced iBeacon in 2013 with its iOS 7, it made it possible for retail store 
retailers to communicate directly and quite precisely with customers as they passed 

within a few feet of in-store beacons. There are many close proximity technolo-
gies such as QR codes, Wi-Fi, and NFC (Near Field Communication), but each has 
drawbacks in terms of precision, cost, and widespread availability. Now that Apple 
has adopted NFC in its hardware for Apple Pay, NFC will become a good candidate 
technology for close proximity marketing. Apple’s iBeacon uses a different technol-
ogy called Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Android phones also have this capability.

Geo-social-based services marketing
Users share their location with friends. Can be used for 
check-in services like Foursquare; friend finders; 
transportation services.
Location-based services marketing 
Provides services to consumers looking for local services 
and products. 
Mobile-local social network 
marketing based on users’ location
Facebook expands local offerings of deals by local firms, 
display ads using News Feed. Launches Facebook 
Marketplace, which enables people to easily buy and sell 
within their local communities, in October 2016.
Upgraded Foursquare app Swarm focuses on social updates 
from specific locations and sending recommendations and 
deals.
Social network monitoring: sends messages within an app 
based on mentions of interest in products in Facebook and 
Twitter posts. MomentFeed allows marketers to listen to 
social chatter on social networks by location, then target 
consumers with geo-specific ads. Used by Pizza Hut, 
Starbucks, and local restaurants.
Intent marketing: scanning social networks for indications 
of real-time consumer interest in specific products. H&M 
partnered with LocalResponse to promote clothing inspired 
by the movie Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. 
Proximity marketing
Send messages to consumers in the area of a store or 
outlet to generate sales using a virtual fence around a 
retail location (could also be an airport, train station, or 
arena). Generally opt in. Whole Foods places geofences 
around its stores to target ads and offers to mobile users 
passing by. 
In-store messaging
Messaging consumers while entering or browsing in a 
store. 
Retailers collect, analyze, and respond to customers’ real-
time shopping behavior. Macy’s, Lord & Taylor, and Target 
use beacon marketing to greet customizers and offer deals.
Location-based app messaging
PayPal’s mobile app detects customers near a store that 
offers PayPal payment options and entices them with offers 
to visit.

BLE is inexpensive to implement, and uses much less power than traditional Blue-
tooth. Unlike QR codes, BLE has a two-way, push-pull communication capability. 
Using QR codes, consumers need to show the code to a QR scanner, and then they 
see information on a product. With iBeacon, consumers can be contacted as soon 
as they walk into a store and exposed to special offers, and then when browsing the 
store, contacted as they pass specific areas, like the jewelry department. This all 
takes place automatically on the user’s iPhone. Consumers can respond to these 
messages as well. For retailers, in-store beacon marketing is aimed at four objectives. 
The customer can be engaged immediately on entry to the store, and then accom-
panied electronically from one area to another, somewhat similar to how luxury 
retail stores assign a salesperson to high-end consumers. Second, beacons can be 
used to stimulate loyalty programs. Consumers who buy often can be noticed upon 
entering the store. Third, retailers can engage in flash sales, instant discounts, and 
other impulse marketing programs inside their physical stores. Finally, beacons can 
be used silently, not pushing offers or goods, but instead just gathering data directly 
about in-store consumer behavior. 
Currently, beacon technology, essentially in-store Bluetooth devices that can com-
municate with user smartphones entering the store, consists of stand-alone apps, each 
following different standards. But several technology firms are trying to build beacon 
capabilities into their popular platforms. In 2015, Google announced its Eddystone 
open-source standard that can work with iOS or Android. In 2016, advertisers are 
beginning to take advantage of this technology. For example, Google has certified a 
proximity marketing company Proxama to provide beacon services based on Eddystone 
to its customers. One application involves alerting consumers to prizes, offers, and 
apps when they are near a beacon located near tourist attractions and transportation 
hubs. Facebook has rolled out Place Tips, offering free Bluetooth devices to merchants. 
When users are recognized as being close to a merchant, Facebook posts to their News 
Feed suggesting they visit the merchant or buy a product. 
Reportedly, 20% of mobile marketing firms that use geo-location marketing are 
using beacons. One analyst claims that over 400 million beacons will be in place in 
five years although most will be in the non-retail world from museums to parks and 
tourist sites. 
In 2014, Macy’s started to deploy iBeacon in many of its retail stores after a suc-
cessful test of the system in San Francisco and New York. Using an app from Shopkick 
(a marketing firm) called shopBeacon, Macy’s customers who have downloaded the 
app receive notifications to open the app when they enter a Macy’s store. Customers 
receive promotions, deals, and discounts. The hope is that by using proximity market-
ing, retail stores will be able to attract more consumers to their stores, and increase 
purchases from those who come to their stores. While Macy’s initially planned to 
install 4,000 beacons throughout its retail chain, they have not revealed how many are 
installed, or what the results have been. Other early adopters of beacon technology 
include American Eagle Outfitters, Lord & Taylor, Sephora, and Apple. 
However, despite the claims of proponents of beacon marketing, beacon technol-
ogy has not revolutionized mobile marketing. Consumers do not appear to have much 
interest in the technology. Beacons require users to have Bluetooth turned on. But 

only 20% of smartphone users in the United States have Bluetooth turned on, and 
another 20% claimed their smartphones did not have Bluetooth (even though they 
likely did have it). Consumers are also concerned about the privacy implications of 
being tracked through a store or on the streets. Many do not want to be bothered with 
in-store notifications, and may resent the intrusion. One beacon platform firm found 
that pushing notices to in-store consumers actually led to a decline in the use of the 
app, and more than one push notice caused a 300% drop in app usage (eMarketer, 
Inc., 2016t). 
STARTING A LOCATION-BASED MARKETING CAMPAIGN
As with all marketing campaigns, start by identifying your objectives and understand 
just how a location-based mobile marketing campaign might help your business. 
Location-based marketing is generally much more action-oriented than other forms 
of online marketing. A person is in a given location only for a short time, measured in 
minutes and hours, rarely days or weeks. If you want the consumer to do something, 
it’s now. Does your product or service have this quality? Is there something related to 
a person’s location that fits with your product? Is there something about your products 
that makes them especially attractive to a mobile audience at a specific location and 
time? There are very few products and services that don’t have a location connection. 
Next, consider the target demographic for your campaign and products. Location-
aware consumers (those with mobile devices and familiar with location-based services) 
tend to be a younger, more educated, and wealthier demographic. They have many of 
the same characteristics as all mobile shoppers.
A strategic analysis of your marketspace is very important. The same questions 
that you would seek to answer if you were doing a nonlocation-aware mobile market-
ing campaign apply to a location-based marketing effort, such as examining what your 
competitors are doing. 
Once you have envisioned your marketing campaign and identified your market, 
it is time to start implementing your mobile campaign. The same steps that you would 
follow in implementing a mobile campaign apply to location-based marketing as well. 
Note that you can’t do everything at once—mobile-centric and location-based. Start 
by doing something simple like local search. Then consider more sophisticated local-
based marketing tactics.
MEASURING LOCATION-BASED MARKETING RESULTS
There are a great many ways to measure the success of a mobile location-based cam-
paign, some very sophisticated. The measures of success will vary depending on the 
objective of the campaign, which might be to raise the awareness of your brand among 
consumers, to bring customers to your retail store, or a click-to-call campaign where 
you want people to make reservations for a concert. 
Because mobile local campaigns use the same marketing ad formats as both tradi-
tional and mobile web marketing, the basic measures of effectiveness are similar. For 
instance, the number of impressions (people who see an ad), click-through rate, and 
unique visitors are basic measures for a mobile local campaign. But mobile location-
based marketing is much more personal and social than traditional web marketing

or even simple mobile marketing: it’s a marketing message directed to a consumer’s 
personal mobile device based on that person’s location. Local mobile marketers hope 
consumers will take follow-on action almost immediately—inquire, reserve, click-to-
call, friend, and ultimately purchase. Table 7.17 describes some of the basic dimen-
sions and metrics to use when evaluating a mobile marketing campaign. The nature 
of the location-based campaign makes a difference for how you measure success. For 
instance, in a click-to-call campaign, you want to measure the volume of calls, duration 
of call, new versus existing customers, and the number of accidental or hostile calls.

E x c h a n g e H u n t e r J u m p e r. c o m : 
Building a Brand with Social Marketing
T
he Internet and Web have enabled thousands of business ideas to become 
online realities. The Internet has reduced the costs of starting a small 
business, and allowed small players to effectively use the same market-
ing and selling tools as major corporations. Small businesses usually 
occupy a market niche not occupied by big players or corporations. One such market 
niche in America, comprising about 10,000 to 30,000 players, is the high-end horse 
show circuit. These are people who are willing to drop $200,000 on a horse that can 
jump a five-foot fence with ease. This may be a very small market, but its members 
are highly motivated to both buy and sell horses, and they are willing to spend in the 
process. ExchangeHunterJumper.com is one example of how a small business focusing 
on a tiny niche market was able to successfully build an online brand.
According to Dagny Amber Aslin, founder and owner of ExchangeHunterJumper.
com (The Exchange), a website created to help owners and professional trainers sell 
high-end competition horses, it’s hard to “get rich” or even make money on the Inter-
net. She adds, “There are a lot of preconceived notions … I beat down a path previously

unplowed. It cost us a lot of money and we suffered many setbacks from our mistakes.” 
Yet the site is still growing and has succeeded where others failed. How did Aslin break 
through and develop a site that works for professionals buying and selling alike? How 
did she build trust? How did she market her services?
Experience helped. Aslin started with applicable experience—in the horse world 
and in the world of Internet marketing. In addition to riding and competing as a child, 
Aslin spent several years working as a professional trainer. Working six-day weeks, 
including weekends, and spending most of her time outdoors riding, teaching, and 
competing, she saw first-hand the challenges facing professional horsemen, and she 
gained valuable credibility with those who would become her audience.
While working in the horse business, and learning how difficult it was to make 
a living, she took a part-time job as an assistant to a top California real estate agent, 
helping him market and sell high-end real estate in the Santa Barbara area. Among 
other activities, she helped him develop and expand his website. Through that experi-
ence, she realized that “selling six-figure horses and seven-figure houses are ridicu-
lously similar—both tend to be overpriced, have emotional strings attached, require 
vettings and exhaustive negotiations, involve agents, and the list goes on.” In 2005, 
when she moved from California back to the Midwest, where she had spent her child-
hood, The Exchange was born. Eleven years later, the equine marketing model she 
has built is “a customized copy” of the real estate program she assisted with in Santa 
Barbara.
Aslin knew that busy horse professionals needed a high-quality, reliable source 
of suitable mounts for their clients, but their day-to-day business lives left them little 
time to thoroughly search the market, and they often lacked a good grasp of modern 
media technology. The same dilemma applied when it came to selling high-end horses. 
In response, she created an organized, professional process for preparing online horse 
sale advertisements. It included detailed forms for sellers to fill out, and she insisted 
that quality photos and video be provided for each horse advertised, enabling her 
to turn the descriptions into accurate portrayals of each animal and its capabilities. 
She created a fee structure that was reasonable and affordable, and she developed a 
multi-channel marketing program.
Aslin understood that her business plan needed to be a living document, evolving 
over time based on what the market was telling her. This helped her make inroads 
in a traditional industry that is very resistant to change. Most horse professionals 
spend their days outside, and tend to do business only with those they know person-
ally—the level of trust is very low. Most existing horse sale websites were little more 
than online classifieds cluttered with unreliable information. Although professional 
horsemen were slow to use computers and the Internet, the rise of smartphones and 
tablet computers has helped increase their comfort level with technology and been a 
huge factor in the increased online involvement of horse professionals.
The Exchange took all of these things into account, and Aslin went further. In 
order to remain true to her business goal of providing a reliable service to professionals 
in the horse industry that would become a source of good horses described accurately, 
Aslin personally reviewed all potential advertisers. In some cases she went back to 

	
C a s e  S t u d y 	

485
sellers and insisted on higher quality photographs and video, and in other cases where 
she determined the horse was not as represented, she turned down their business. 
The initial business plan process involved strict screening, and it meant turning away 
money and valuing quality over quantity in every area—horses, buyers, traffic, and 
ads. It was a hard and expensive premise to adhere to when building a reputation 
from scratch, but through persistence and dedication it has worked, and today, The 
Exchange’s reputation and “brand” has become one of its most valuable assets.
In discussing some of the obstacles she faced in getting The Exchange up and 
running, Aslin starts with education—her own or lack thereof, specifically in the areas 
of graphic design and web technology. While she knew what professional horsemen 
needed, she did not know how to translate that into graphic design or onto the Web. 
She says that looking back on the original logo and print designs is “a painful exercise,” 
but she is happy with the current direction.
The budget was also an initial obstacle, as there wasn’t a lot of money to spend 
up front. However, in hindsight, she believes that gave her an advantage because she 
had to learn what her market wanted and was able to do so without breaking the bank. 
Conversely, her main competitor took an opposite track, spent big up front, missed 
the mark with customers, and is now defunct.
In addition, she faced the negative perception among industry professionals and 
prospective buyers that equine Internet advertising was “worthless.” Further, much of 
her target audience barely knew how to use a computer, didn’t have e-mail addresses, 
and had been doing business in the same old-school manner for decades. For a few 
key players this worked very well, but it left a void for those outside that inner circle 
to move horses. Through a combination of knowledge of the marketplace, on-the-job 
training, perseverance, and listening to what the market was telling her, The Exchange 
has successfully begun to fill that void. Today, The Exchange typically manages the 
marketing for 160–180 horses at any given time, and anticipates that this number will 
likely increase to over 200 in the near future.
Here’s how it works. The Exchange handles advertising for sellers and trainers 
across the country. In 2016, show horses advertised on The Exchange are typically 
priced from $60,000 to $80,000. The Exchange specializes strictly in hunter-jumper 
show horses, and specifically those suited for high-level competition.
Trainers/sellers who sign up for a premium listing pay a flat $250 fee for the 
initial advertisement and a subscription fee of $35/month, which includes a listing 
on The Exchange’s website featuring the horse’s details, photos, show record, lineage, 
and videos. The Exchange provides copy-writing services and professionally edits 
all videos supplied by sellers, hosting them on its private server and making them 
available to download, embed, and share. Each listing typically takes 8–10 hours to 
prepare. In 2012, The Exchange added a second listing alternative—a Sale Barn listing 
for $300 a month or $3,000 a year, that allows for listing of up to 10 horses. A three-
month commitment is required, but there are no initial or other fees. Once the com-
mitment is fulfilled, sellers can deactivate and then reactivate their Sale Barn page 
as needed at any time without any further charge. Aimed at high-volume operations 
with frequent turnover, the Sale Barn page can link to the seller’s website, YouTube,

Facebook, and Twitter feeds, if available, with the goal of increasing overall brand 
awareness for the seller’s business. Aslin designed the Sale Barn as an affordable 
option for professionals who might otherwise be reluctant to spend on marketing. 
The Sale Barn page provides sellers with a mini website and social media advertis-
ing, including three sidebar Facebook ads each week. These have the advantage 
of promoting not only the sellers but also have proved to be a useful promotional 
tool for the Sale Barn package itself, since those who click on the ad end up on the 
ExchangeHunterJumper website and are able to see its services first-hand and in 
depth. International sellers are given a slight additional discount. In 2016, the Sale 
Barn program has proven to be a major success, with 20 different sale barns listed, 
including one in Germany and one in France.
Statistics show that a horse’s first month online is most successful in terms 
of the number of web page visits. With the addition of monthly campaign man-
agement, The Exchange helps keep each horse’s marketing fresh and up to date. 
Updates can immediately escalate a horse’s popularity as much as 30% and attract 
new potential buyers. Sellers are encouraged to provide updates as frequently as 
possible. Online videos add to the brand of the horse for sale and are especially 
important for young horses or those “growing into” their price tags. Updates are 
added to the website and promoted through various media outlets including Face-
book and e-mail campaigns.
Sellers currently fill out two separate forms: a credit card registration form and 
an equine fact sheet. The fact sheet includes a long series of checkboxes from which 
sellers select preworded traits, coupled with space for additional written descriptions. 
This saves some production time, although writing the actual copy is still a major 
part of the value that The Exchange provides. To implement this option, Aslin spent 
time investigating form-building tools. Custom-built form solutions were likely to be 
too expensive, so she played with numerous online form generators and ultimately 
was able to find some that offered great functionality at a relatively low cost. So, for 
example, a seller can indicate that the horse is a “jumper” and questions specific to 
jumpers will be displayed.
The Exchange develops a specific marketing strategy for each horse listed. This 
includes reviewing information submitted, combing through a horse’s official show 
record, considering impartial impressions, and identifying the most likely buyers. If 
The Exchange thinks that the photos or videos don’t help to sell the horse, they advise 
the seller on how to improve them. This advice stems from experience in marketing 
all types of horses from coast to coast, and an understanding of varied buyer profiles 
and geographic trends that exist in the market.
Social marketing forms the core of the Exchange’s marketing efforts. Starting 
in 2009, The Exchange began experimenting with social media including RSS feeds, 
YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Aslin notes that when she began The 
Exchange, social media was not yet the phenomenon that it is today, but when its sig-
nificance started to became apparent, she had no choice but to jump in and begin using 
it, learning as she went. The Exchange has experienced varying success with social 
media. For instance, The Exchange runs multiple RSS feeds through the free service, 

	
C a s e  S t u d y 	

487
FeedBurner, although thus far, the equestrian set does not appear to be particularly 
interested in RSS feed subscriptions. The company uses a professional video manage-
ment system from Vzaar that hosts all of its videos, serves to most smartphones, and 
provides more control, branding, and flexibility than YouTube without any annoy-
ing advertisements. However, it continues to maintain a YouTube channel in order 
to increase exposure and to be in on YouTube “Horse for Sale” searches. Facebook 
has been the most resounding social media success. The Exchange now has almost 
16,000 fans on Facebook. In addition, Aslin’s personal Facebook friends, which number 
over 1,800, extend her cumulative Facebook reach to almost 18,000 friends and fans, 
and make her online marketing efforts even more personal. The Exchange’s Twitter 
account has over 2,000 followers, and links with both The Exchange’s Facebook page 
and its YouTube channel. The YouTube channel has over 60,000 views. The Exchange’s 
Instagram feed has over 5,000 followers. Because every business is different, The 
Exchange’s experience suggests it’s important for e-commerce sites to experiment 
with social media to determine which outlets are most effective in reaching their 
specific target audiences. Currently, The Exchange spends what it characterizes as 
a “fair amount of money” boosting posts and promotion content on Facebook each 
month, which she has found has become increasingly necessary in order for her 
social media marketing on the platform to have any effect. Aslin has also found that 
posting in various Facebook Groups focused on sales of the types of horses marketed 
on the Exchange (currently free) often results in good “click-bait” and some increased 
website traffic. 
To track the effectiveness of her social marketing efforts, Aslin uses various track-
ing systems. For instance, Google Analytics allows her to track exactly how many 
people are on the ExchangeHunterJumper site in real time and how they got there. 
Aslin has found that focusing solely on Likes is not sufficient. For example, she notes 
that a photo she posted advertising a horse on Facebook generated only 10 Likes, but 
that actually almost 150 people followed the link associated with the photo to the 
ExchangeHunterJumper website. She also uses a short URL service, bit.ly, to create 
unique URLs associated with Facebook and other social media posts that have built-
in click trackers. This enables her to quickly see the collective success of her social 
marketing efforts; in a good month, bit.ly stats show around 8,000 click-throughs to 
the ExchangeHunterJumper site. 
Another challenge is developing the actual social media content, which needs 
to be presented in such as way as to attract attention, and determining the optimal 
amount and timing of new content to post each day. Aslin notes that if she posts too 
many times a day, or posts too much content too close together, the reach of her posts 
seems to drop off.
Although Facebook is currently the primary social marketing platform for 
ExchangeHunterJumper, the firm also has loyal followers on Instagram and Twitter. 
Although Aslin doubts that many of these followers are actual buyers or sellers at this 
time, she notes that in the future they probably will be. Her site has grown up along 
with her clientele, and children who once drooled over ponies on her site are now, 11 
years later, soon-to-be adults and, possibly, young professionals.

The firm’s website is also a key element of its e-commerce presence. Aslin con-
tinually reviews the design of the website with an eye to making it the most effective 
marketing tool possible. She built the original site herself in 2005 and updated it almost 
yearly in response to her target market’s needs. In 2012, Aslin relaunched the site for 
a fifth time, and for the first time ever hired a professional web development team to 
convert the static HTML site into a dynamically driven content management system 
on the Expression Engine platform. While she was able to keep costs low by designing 
and developing the site’s CSS layout, the advanced functionality that was desired, such 
as the sale horse filter that enables shoppers to sort horses based on price, location, 
gender, type, and size, still required a hefty five-figure investment. Aslin believes 
the ability to get to know the market and update the site accordingly has kept The 
Exchange fresh and innovative. Every iteration of the website has been focused on 
meeting the target market’s needs. For instance, she has also spent considerable time 
and expense to make sure The Exchange’s website, including video, works just as well 
on mobile devices as it does on a traditional laptop or desktop computer. Aslin has 
scrapped plans to create a stand-alone mobile site in favor of using responsive design 
techniques for The Exchange’s site. 
In addition to the website, The Exchange uses a variety of other marketing strate-
gies, including e-mail campaigns, magazine advertising, and word of mouth. It ceased 
distributing its four-color, printed National Sales List booklet due to its high cost, and 
now relies almost totally on various types of online marketing. Aslin has found it has 
been extremely helpful to have the web development experience she has honed over 
the years. Here are some of her words of wisdom: She feels that entrepreneurs don’t 
necessarily have to know how to build sites, but do need to be familiar with what is 
and what is not possible in site construction. It is important to understand which 
functions are complicated and which are not, so that overly complicated add-ons that 
don’t really add to the user experience can be eliminated from tight budgets. It’s also 
important to know what technology is popular now and what technology is just around 
the corner. Even if you think you are proficient in all the tasks you will need to launch 
your business, with the rapid pace of technology, you inevitably spend much of your 
time learning something totally new, whether you want to or not. 
By paying attention to these words of wisdom, as well as to detail at every step of 
the marketing process, The Exchange has managed to build a successful brand, one 
the horse community has come to rely upon.

REVIEW
K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Understand the difference between traditional online marketing and the new social-mobile-local marketing platforms 
and the relationships between social, mobile, and local marketing. 
•	
Social, mobile, and local marketing have transformed the online marketing landscape. The major trends 
and concepts include:
•	
The emphasis in online marketing has shifted from exposing consumers to messages toward engag-
ing them in conversations about your brand. 
•	
Social marketing means all things social: listening, discussing, interacting, empathizing, and engag-
ing the consumer.
•	
Social marketing and advertising is not simply a “new ad channel,” but a collection of technology-
based tools for communicating with shoppers.
•	
In the past, businesses could tightly control their brand messaging and lead consumers down a fun-
nel of cues that ended in a purchase. This is no longer the case. Instead, consumer purchase deci-
sions are increasingly driven by the conversations, choices, tastes, and opinions of the consumer’s 
social network.
•	
Social, mobile, and local marketing are the fastest growing forms of online marketing.
•	
Social, mobile, and local digital marketing are self-reinforcing and connected.
•	
Local and mobile marketing are highly related: local advertisers most often target mobile devices.
•	
The strong ties among social, mobile, and local marketing have significant implications for managing a 
marketing campaign in this new environment. When you design a social marketing campaign, you must 
also consider that your customers will be accessing the campaign using mobile devices, and often they 
will also be looking for local content.
Understand the social marketing process from fan acquisition to sales and the marketing capabilities of social 
marketing platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest. 
•	
In social marketing, the objective is to encourage your potential customers to become fans of your com-
pany’s products and services and engage with your business by entering into a conversation with it.
•	
There are five steps in the social marketing process model: fan acquisition, engagement, amplification, 
community, and brand strength and sales.
•	
Facebook is a social network that is designed to encourage people to reveal as much personal information 
about themselves as feasible, including activities, behavior, photos, music, movies, and purchases.
•	
Facebook’s features are built to maximize the connections among people in the form of notifications, 
tagging, messaging, posting, and sharing. In many instances, the movement of personal information is so 
widespread that it is beyond the understanding of users.
•	
Social density refers to the number of interactions among members of a group and reflects the “connect-
edness” of a group, even if these connections are forced on users.
•	
Facebook has many marketing tools, including Reactions buttons, Brand Pages, News Feed ads, Right-
hand sidebar ads, mobile ads, video ads, and Facebook Exchange.
•	
The effectiveness of Facebook ads can be measured using five stages of the social marketing model: fan 
acquisition, engagement, amplification, community, and ultimately brand strengthening and sales. 
•	
Twitter is a micro-blogging social network site that allows users to send and receive 140-character mes-
sages as well as videos, photos, and article previews.

C H A P T E R  7     S o c i a l ,  M o b i l e ,  a n d  L o c a l  M a r k e t i n g
•	
Twitter marketing tools include Promoted Tweets, Promoted Trends, Promoted Accounts, Enhanced Pro-
file Pages, the Twitter Amplify program, television ad retargeting, Lead Generation Cards, and app install 
and app engagement ads.
•	
Measuring the results of Twitter marketing is similar to measuring the results of Facebook and other 
social marketing platforms, with some minor changes to account for the unique qualities of Twitter. 
•	
Pinterest is the social network site that provides users with an online board to which they can “pin” inter-
esting pictures. The success of Pinterest is based in part on a shift in consumer behavior enabled by new 
technologies: people talk about brands using pictures rather than words. 
•	
Pinterest marketing tools include Promoted Pins; adding a Pin It logo to your website; pinning photos to 
Pinterest and direct users to your website; creating theme-based Pin It boards; placing URLs to stores that 
you support and receive lead generation fees from; integrating your pins and boards with other social 
sites; networking with users and followers. 
•	
Pinterest campaigns can be measured using the same procedures as for Facebook and Twitter. The key 
dimensions to measure are fan (follower) acquisition, engagement, amplification, community, and sales.
•	
Other social networks, such as Instagram, LinkedIn and Snapchat, provide similar advertising opportu-
nites to marketers.
•	
One downside of social marketing is that brands lose a substantial amount of control over where their ads 
appear in terms of other content and what people say about their brands on social sites.
Identify the key elements of a mobile marketing campaign. 
•	
Although still in its infancy, mobile marketing involves the use of mobile devices such as smartphones 
and tablet computers to display banner ads, rich media, video, games, e-mail, text messaging, in-store 
messaging, QuickResponse (QR) codes, and couponing. 
•	
Mobile devices represent a radical departure from previous marketing technologies simply because the 
devices integrate so many human and consumer activities from telephoning or texting friends, to listen-
ing to music, watching videos, and using the Web to shop and purchase goods. 
•	
The mobile platform has changed over the past few years, and there are now almost as many tablet users 
as smartphone users in the United States.
•	
Mobile users spend the vast majority of their time using mobile apps as opposed to mobile web browsers. 
Marketers need to place ads in apps where consumers spend most of their time.
•	
Mobile devices create a multi-screen world: smartphones, tablets, desktops, and television. The reality, 
and the future, of computing devices is that consumers will be multi-platform: using desktops and laptops 
at work and home, and smartphones and tablets at home as well as when moving about.
•	
The implications of the multi-device platform, or screen diversity, environment are that marketing needs 
to be designed for whatever device the consumer is using, and consistent branding across platforms will 
be important.
•	
Unlike social marketing, mobile marketing does not require a great deal of new marketing vocabulary. All 
the marketing formats available on the desktop are also available on mobile devices. With few exceptions, 
mobile marketing is very much like desktop marketing—except it is smaller, mobile, and with the user all 
the time.
•	
The major marketing opportunities in mobile marketing are search ads, display ads, videos and rich media, 
messaging (SMS/MMS/PPS), and other familiar formats like e-mail, classified, and lead generation.
•	
The effectiveness of mobile marketing can be measured using the dimensions of the social marketing 
process model: fan acquisition, engagement, amplification, community, brand strength, and sales. Tradi-
tional web-browser based metrics also can be used when measuring mobile campaigns. 
Understand the capabilities of location-based local marketing. 
•	
Location-based marketing is the targeting of marketing messages to users based on their location. Gener-
ally, location-based marketing involves marketing of location-based services.

	
R e v i e w 	

491
•	
Examples of location-based services are personal navigation, point-of-interest, reviews, friend-finder, and 
family-tracker services.
•	
Location-based marketing is dependent on two technologies: accurate mapping software and mobile 
device geo-positioning technologies like GPS, Wi-Fi network location data, and Bluetooth low energy 
(BLE) technology.
•	
Location-based mobile marketing is currently a small part of the online marketing environment, but is 
expected to double over the next two years, and is growing far faster than any other form of digital adver-
tising.
•	
The ad formats used in local mobile marketing are familiar—search ads, display, social/native advertis-
ing, video, and SMS text messages. A very large percentage of these local mobile ads will be delivered by 
search engines such as Google, and social sites such as Facebook.
•	
The key players in location-based mobile marketing are the same giants of advertising who dominate the 
mobile marketing environment: Google, Facebook, Apple, Twitter, YP (formerly Yellow Pages), Pandora, 
and Millennial Media.
•	
Geo-aware techniques identify the location of a user’s device and then target marketing to the device, 
recommending actions within reach.
•	
Geo-targeting of ads involves sending ads based on the user’s location. 
•	
Proximity marketing techniques identify a perimeter around a physical location, and then target ads to 
users within that perimeter, recommending actions possible within the fenced-in area.
•	
In-store messaging involves messaging consumers while entering and browsing in a retail store. This 
requires a very precise calculation of location.
•	
Consumers who seek information about local businesses using mobile devices are much more active and 
ready to purchase than desktop users.
•	
Measuring the effectiveness of location-based mobile campaigns involves using the same techniques used 
for browser-based search and display ads (impressions), but also should include the dimensions of the 
social marketing process model such as acquisition, engagement, amplification, community, and brand 
strength and sales.

n June 2014, Google was forced to 
begin removing certain search engine 
query results in Europe after a ruling 
by the Court of Justice of the European 
Union, Europe’s highest court. The ruling gives 
individuals the right to request that certain 
links to personal information found through a 
search of their names be removed. The court’s 
ruling has come to be known as the “right to 
be forgotten” (sometimes given the acronym 
RTBF, or sometimes referred to as the “right 
to delist”). In an age where it seems there 
are no limits on the ability or willingness of 
private Internet firms to collect and dissemi-
nate personal information, regardless of the user consenting to or knowing of its collection 
and use, the E.U.’s ruling is possibly the beginning of a new era of digital privacy based on 
the simple idea that individuals have a right to manage their online personal information 
and public image. Google, Facebook, Twitter, and many other U.S. Internet-based firms 
whose business models depend on virtually no limitations on the collection and use of 
personal information have lobbied strongly against the idea that individuals have a right 
to manage their personal online information. However, the European Court of Justice’s 
decision is final, and Google, along with Yahoo, Microsoft, and others, have begun to 
implement the ruling. While simple in concept, the right to be forgotten can be devilishly 
difficult and expensive to implement in practice.
The court’s decision was based on a 2010 lawsuit brought by a Spanish citizen, Mario 
Costeja Gonzalez, against a Spanish newspaper, and against Google Spain and Google 
Inc. (the American parent firm), which had linked his name with an auction notice in a 
newspaper that his house had been repossessed and was being sold in order to pay off 
debts. A Google search on Gonzalez’ name returned a link to the newspaper notice as the 
most prominent link. Gonzalez’ suit said that issues of his debt and foreclosure had been 
resolved years ago, and that the reference to this event was irrelevant and an invasion 
of his privacy as defined in the European Union Data Protection Directive—Europe’s 
digital era privacy legislation that governs personal information in the 28 countries that 
make up the European Union. Gonzalez requested that the newspaper remove or alter the 
pages it posted on the Web and that Google Spain and Google Inc. be required to remove 
the link between his name and the auction notice in the newspaper. Gonzalez said he was

not worried about his online image as much as the impact on his work and reputation as 
a lawyer, and the potential of the notice to injure his law business. There had also been 
thousands of other requests by Europeans asking Google to remove links to their names 
that they claim are inappropriate, inaccurate, no longer relevant, and interfere with their 
privacy. 
Google and the newspaper argued that because the server providing the results for 
Google searches in Spain was located outside Europe, the E.U. rules and privacy legisla-
tion did not apply. Google also argued that it was a search engine that simply provided 
links to information stored by others, not a data repository, and that it was not responsible 
for the accuracy or relevance of information stored by other organizations. Consequently, 
Google claimed that it should not be subject to the E.U. Data Protection Directive because 
it pertained only to data repositories. Finally, Google argued that under European law, 
individuals do not have the right to request that their personal data be removed from ac-
cessibility via a search engine. In public statements, Google also said it would be difficult 
or impossible to respond to thousands or millions of requests to eliminate links; granting 
these rights would allow criminals, fraudsters, sexual predators, and corrupt public of-
ficials to rewrite history; and that it would be very expensive to respond to requests and 
would potentially limit innovation in the future.
In 2014, the Court of Justice ruled that E.U. data protection policies were not 
limited by territory and that they apply to search engines no matter where the servers 
are located. Second, the court found that search engines are “controllers” of individual 
personal data within the European Union and therefore must comply with E.U. rules. Prior 
to this ruling, search engines like Google had been considered merely processors of online 
data, and therefore exempt from data protection rules in Europe. Finally the court found 
that Europeans do indeed have a right to ask search engines to remove links to personal 
information about them (the “right to be forgotten”) when that information is inaccurate, 
inadequate, irrelevant, or excessive. The economic interests of the search engine to provide 
unfettered access to personal information did not justify interfering with the individual’s 
right to be forgotten and personal privacy.
The court also clarified that the right to be forgotten is not absolute, but would have 
to be balanced against other rights and obligations such as freedom of expression, freedom 
of the press, and the broader public interest. For instance, the court’s ruling did not require 
the newspaper to change any of the pages in its archives. The original auction notice 
remains. In other cases, the public has an interest in ensuring that convicted criminals not 
be allowed to escape their criminal records, which are public records in most jurisdictions. 
Rather than a blanket right granted to whomever applies to have information removed 
from search engines, instead the court required a case-by-case assessment that examines 
the type of information, its potential for harm to the individual’s private life, and the in-
terest of the public in having access to that information. Also, for “public figures,” those 
who have thrust themselves into public roles, such as politicians, celebrities, or business 
leaders, the public interest in knowing may trump the private interest in being forgotten.
As of October 15, 2016, Google said it had received over 570,000 requests from 
people who wanted, in aggregate, 1.73 million links to online information about them 
removed, and that it had removed about 43% of those links based on internal guidelines

that they have developed. However, the process has proved to be problematic. Google 
has been criticized by various European privacy regulators for its practice of informing 
websites that their links are being removed from its search results, noting that this may 
result in even more attention to the links. In the United Kingdom, the U.K.’s Information 
Commissioner’s Office has ordered Google to remove links to news stories about the 
removal of links, on the grounds that the new links defeat the purpose of the original 
removal. Other critics complain that the decisions should not be left in the hands of a 
private company. 
In 2016, in response to a ruling from France’s data protection authority, Google began 
filtering delisted links across all of its domains, even its flagship Google.com domain, when 
searches originate within Europe. Previously, Google had enforced the right to be forgot-
ten only on search results from European domains, allowing residents from European 
countries to simply use Google’s .com domain to obtain information and links that had 
been purged from searches on its European domains, like Google.co.uk and Google.fr. 
Microsoft followed suit with its Bing search engine several months later, hoping to avoid 
potential hefty fines and penalties. Nevertheless, determined sleuths can still use techniques 
such as searching through archives of online newspapers to find stories with content likely 
to prompt information removal requests. Also, some new data storage techniques like 
blockchains are very difficult to manipulate, especially to remove entries; the immutability 
of blockchains is often cited as one of its great strengths, but could become a weakness 
when complying with the right to be forgotten. Although Google may remove many links 
to sensitive stories, forcing the newspapers to censor their own work has dire implications 
for freedom of the press. Google is also appealing the ruling, arguing that one country’s 
rulings should not apply to a country globally.
The reactions to the Court of Justice’s rulings and France’s efforts to extend the right 
to forget beyond the boundaries of Europe reflect a deep digital divide between Europe 
and the United States when it comes to privacy and the balance between managing per-
sonal information (privacy) and freedom of expression and the press. In Europe, many 
nations celebrated the ruling as a victory over arrogant U.S. Internet companies and their 
cavalier attitudes towards user privacy. U.S. newspapers and technologists emphasize the 
importance of a free press and warn against making it possible for individuals to hide their 
past misdoings. Perhaps the advocates for freedom of the press have a point: in 2016, 
an Italian court ordered an online newspaper to institute an “expiration date” on their 
articles, after which the content must be removed if it is requested. This marks the first 
time that a newspaper has been targeted in an attempt to enforce the right to be forgot-
ten, and has ugly implications for journalism if it is not appealed. Although this ruling is 
extreme and not likely to become any sort of standard, there is little doubt that European 
views on privacy, and the idea that data belongs first and foremost to the individual, will 
have an impact on U.S. privacy claims and laws, especially if France’s requirement that 
Google remove links from all its sites around the world, not just in Europe, prevails.

etermining how or whether personal information should be retained or 
deleted on the Internet is just one of many ethical, social, and political 
issues raised by the rapid evolution of the Internet and e-commerce. 
For instance, as discussed in the opening case, whether individuals lose control over 
all personal information once it is placed on the Internet is still up for debate in the 
United States. In Europe, in contrast, individuals do retain rights to their personal 
information. These questions are not just ethical questions that we as individuals have 
to answer; they also involve social institutions such as family, schools, business firms, 
and in some cases, entire nation-states. And these questions have obvious political 
dimensions because they involve collective choices about how we should live and 
what laws we would like to live under.
In this chapter, we discuss the ethical, social, and political issues raised in e-com-
merce, provide a framework for organizing the issues, and make recommendations 
for managers who are given the responsibility of operating e-commerce companies 
within commonly accepted standards of appropriateness.
	 8.1	
UNDERSTANDING ETHICAL, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL 
ISSUES IN E-COMMERCE
The Internet and its use in e-commerce have raised pervasive ethical, social, and politi-
cal issues on a scale unprecedented for computer technology. Entire sections of daily 
newspapers and weekly magazines are devoted to the social impact of the Internet. But 
why is this so? Why is the Internet at the root of so many contemporary controversies? 
Part of the answer lies in the underlying features of Internet technology itself, and the 
ways in which it has been exploited by business firms. Internet technology and its use 
in e-commerce disrupt existing social and business relationships and understandings.
Consider for instance Table 1.2 (in Chapter 1), which lists the unique features of 
Internet technology. Instead of considering the business consequences of each unique 
feature, Table 8.1 examines the actual or potential ethical, social, and/or political 
consequences of the technology.
We live in an “information society,” where power and wealth increasingly depend 
on information and knowledge as central assets. Controversies over information are 
often disagreements over power, wealth, influence, and other things thought to be valu-
able. Like other technologies, such as steam, electricity, telephones, and television, 
the Internet and e-commerce can be used to achieve social progress, and for the most 
part, this has occurred. However, the same technologies can be used to commit crimes, 
despoil the environment, and threaten cherished social values. Before automobiles, 
there was very little interstate crime and very little federal jurisdiction over crime. 
Likewise with the Internet: before the Internet, there was very little “cybercrime.”
Many business firms and individuals are benefiting from the commercial devel-
opment of the Internet, but this development also exacts a price from individuals, 
organizations, and societies. These costs and benefits must be carefully considered 
by those seeking to make ethical and socially responsible decisions in this new envi-

ronment. The question is: How can you as a manager make reasoned judgments 
about what your firm should do in a number of e-commerce areas—from securing the 
privacy of your customer’s clickstream to ensuring the integrity of your company’s 
domain name?
A MODEL FOR ORGANIZING THE ISSUES
E-commerce—and the Internet—have raised so many ethical, social, and political 
issues that it is difficult to classify them all, and hence, complicated to see their 
relationship to one another. Clearly, ethical, social, and political issues are interre-
lated. One way to organize the ethical, social, and political dimensions surrounding

Ubiquity—Internet/web technology is 
available everywhere: at work, at home, 
and elsewhere via mobile devices, anytime.
Work and shopping can invade family life; shopping can distract workers at work, 
lowering productivity; use of mobile devices can lead to automobile and industrial 
accidents. Presents confusing issues of “nexus” to taxation authorities.
Global reach—The technology reaches 
across national boundaries, around the 
Earth.
Reduces cultural diversity in products; weakens local small firms while 
strengthening large global firms; moves manufacturing production to low-wage 
areas of the world; weakens the ability of all nations—large and small—to control 
their information destiny.
Universal standards—There is one set 
of technology standards, namely Internet 
standards.
Increases vulnerability to viruses and hacking attacks worldwide, affecting millions 
of people at once. Increases the likelihood of “information” crime, crimes against 
systems, and deception.
Richness—Video, audio, and text 
messages are possible.
A “screen technology” that reduces use of text and potentially the ability to read by 
focusing instead on video and audio messages. Potentially very persuasive 
messages that may reduce reliance on multiple independent sources of information.
Interactivity—The technology works 
through interaction with the user.
The nature of interactivity at commercial sites can be shallow and meaningless. 
Customer e-mails are frequently not read by human beings. Customers do not really 
“co-produce” the product as much as they “co-produce” the sale. The amount of 
“customization” of products that occurs is minimal, occurring within predefined 
platforms and plug-in options.
Information density—The technology 
reduces information costs, and raises 
quality.
While the total amount of information available to all parties increases, so does the 
possibility of false and misleading information, unwanted information, and invasion 
of solitude. Trust, authenticity, accuracy, completeness, and other quality features of 
information can be degraded. The ability of individuals and organizations to make 
sense out of this plethora of information is limited.
Personalization/Customization—The 
technology allows personalized messages 
to be delivered to individuals as well as 
groups.
Opens up the possibility of intensive invasion of privacy for commercial and 
governmental purposes that is unprecedented.
Social technology—The technology 
enables user content generation and social 
networking.
Creates opportunities for cyberbullying, abusive language, and predation; 
challenges concepts of privacy, fair use, and consent to use posted information; 
creates new opportunities for surveillance by authorities and corporations into 
private lives.

e-commerce is shown in Figure 8.1. At the individual level, what appears as an ethical 
issue—”What should I do?”—is reflected at the social and political levels—“What should 
we as a society and government do?” The ethical dilemmas you face as a manager of 
a business using the Web reverberate and are reflected in social and political debates. 
The major ethical, social, and political issues that have developed around e-commerce 
over the past 10 years can be loosely categorized into four major dimensions: informa-
tion rights, property rights, governance, and public safety and welfare.
Some of the ethical, social, and political issues raised in each of these areas include 
the following:
•	 Information rights: What rights to their own personal information do individuals 
have in a public marketplace, or in their private homes, when Internet technologies 
make information collection so pervasive and efficient? What rights do individuals 
have to access information about business firms and other organizations?
•	 Property rights: How can traditional intellectual property rights be enforced in 
an Internet world where perfect copies of protected works can be made and easily 
distributed worldwide in seconds?
•	 Governance: Should the Internet and e-commerce be subject to public laws? And if 
so, what law-making bodies have jurisdiction—state, federal, and/or international?
	
FIGURE 8.1	
THE MORAL DIMENSIONS OF AN INTERNET SOCIETY
The introduction of the Internet and e-commerce impacts individuals, societies, and political institutions. 
These impacts can be classified into four moral dimensions: property rights, information rights, governance, 
and public safety and welfare.

	
	
U n d e r s t a n d i n g  E t h i c a l ,  S o c i a l ,  a n d  P o l i t i c a l  I s s u e s  i n  E - c o m m e r c e 	 
501
•	 Public safety and welfare: What efforts should be undertaken to ensure equi-
table access to the Internet and e-commerce channels? Should governments be 
responsible for ensuring that schools and colleges have access to the Internet? Are 
certain online content and activities—such as pornography, gambling, or anony-
mous tweeting of hateful language—a threat to public safety and welfare? What 
about connected cars? Should mobile commerce be allowed from moving vehicles?
To illustrate, imagine that at any given moment, society and individuals are more 
or less in an ethical equilibrium brought about by a delicate balancing of individuals, 
social organizations, and political institutions. Individuals know what is expected of 
them, social organizations such as business firms know their limits, capabilities, and 
roles, and political institutions provide a supportive framework of market regulation, 
banking, and commercial law that provides sanctions against violators.
Now, imagine we drop into the middle of this calm setting a powerful new tech-
nology such as the Internet and e-commerce. Suddenly, individuals, business firms, 
and political institutions are confronted by new possibilities of behavior. For instance, 
individuals discover that they can download perfect digital copies of music tracks from 
websites without paying anyone, something that, under the old technology of CDs, 
would have been impossible. This can be done, despite the fact that these music tracks 
still legally belong to the owners of the copyright—musicians and record label compa-
nies. Then, business firms discover that they can make a business out of aggregating 
these digital musical tracks—or creating a mechanism for sharing musical tracks—even 
though they do not “own” them in the traditional sense. The record companies, courts, 
and Congress were not prepared at first to cope with the onslaught of online digital 
copying. Courts and legislative bodies will have to make new laws and reach new judg-
ments about who owns digital copies of copyrighted works and under what conditions 
such works can be “shared.” It may take years to develop new understandings, laws, 
and acceptable behavior in just this one area of social impact. In the meantime, as an 
individual and a manager, you will have to decide what you and your firm should do 
in legal “gray” areas, where there is conflict between ethical principles but no clear-cut 
legal or cultural guidelines. How can you make good decisions in this type of situation?
Before examining the four moral dimensions of e-commerce in greater depth, we 
will briefly review some basic concepts of ethical reasoning that you can use as a guide 
to ethical decision making, and provide general reasoning principles about the social 
and political issues of the Internet that you will face in the future.
BASIC ETHICAL CONCEPTS: RESPONSIBILITY, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND 
LIABILITY
Ethics is at the heart of social and political debates about the Internet. Ethics is the 
study of principles that individuals and organizations can use to determine right and 
wrong courses of action. It is assumed in ethics that individuals are free moral agents 
who are in a position to make choices. When faced with alternative courses of action, 
what is the correct moral choice? Extending ethics from individuals to business firms 
and even entire societies can be difficult, but it is not impossible. As long as there is 
ethics
the study of principles that 
individuals and organiza-
tions can use to determine 
right and wrong courses of 
action

a decision-making body or individual (such as a board of directors or CEO in a business 
firm, or a governmental body in a society), their decisions can be judged against a 
variety of ethical principles.
If you understand some basic ethical principles, your ability to reason about larger 
social and political debates will be improved. In western culture, there are four basic 
principles that all ethical schools of thought share: responsibility, accountability, liabil-
ity, and due process. Responsibility means that as free moral agents, individuals, 
organizations, and societies are responsible for the actions they take. Accountability 
means that individuals, organizations, and societies should be held accountable to 
others for the consequences of their actions. The third principle—liability—extends 
the concepts of responsibility and accountability to the area of law. Liability is a 
feature of political systems in which a body of law is in place that permits individuals 
to recover the damages done to them by other actors, systems, or organizations. Due 
process is a feature of law-governed societies and refers to a process in which laws 
are known and understood, and there is an ability to appeal to higher authorities to 
ensure that the laws have been correctly applied.
You can use these concepts immediately to understand some contemporary Inter-
net debates. For instance, consider the 2005 U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case 
of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios v. Grokster, et al. MGM had sued Grokster and other 
P2P networks for copyright infringement. The court decided that because the primary 
and intended use of Internet P2P file-sharing services such as Grokster, StreamCast, 
and Kazaa was the swapping of copyright-protected music and video files, the file-
sharing services should be held accountable and shut down. Although Grokster and 
the other networks acknowledged that the most common use of the software was for 
illegal digital music file-swapping, they argued that there were substantial, nontrivial 
uses of the same networks for legally sharing files. They also argued they should not 
be held accountable for what individuals do with their software, any more than Sony 
could be held accountable for how people use VCRs, or Xerox for how people use 
copying machines. Ultimately, the Supreme Court ruled that Grokster and other P2P 
networks could be held accountable for the illegal actions of their users if it could be 
shown that they intended their software to be used for illegal downloading and sharing, 
and had marketed the software for that purpose. The court relied on copyright laws to 
arrive at its decisions, but these laws reflect some basic underlying ethical principles 
of responsibility, accountability, and liability.
Underlying the Grokster Supreme Court decision is a fundamental rejection of 
the notion that the Internet is an ungoverned “Wild West” environment that cannot 
be controlled. Under certain defined circumstances, the courts will intervene into 
the uses of the Internet. No organized civilized society has ever accepted the proposi-
tion that technology can flaunt basic underlying social and cultural values. Through 
all of the industrial and technological developments that have taken place, societies 
have intervened by means of legal and political decisions to ensure that the tech-
nology serves socially acceptable ends without stifling the positive consequences of 
innovation and wealth creation. The Internet in this sense is no different, and we 
can expect societies around the world to exercise more regulatory control over the 
responsibility
as free moral agents, 
individuals, organizations, 
and societies are respon-
sible for the actions they 
take
accountability
individuals, organizations, 
and societies should be 
held accountable to others 
for the consequences of 
their actions
liability
a feature of political 
systems in which a body of 
law is in place that permits 
individuals to recover the 
damages done to them by 
other actors, systems, or 
organizations
due process
a process in which laws are 
known and understood 
and there is an ability to 
appeal to higher authori-
ties to ensure that the laws 
have been correctly applied

Internet and e-commerce in an effort to arrive at a new balance between innova-
tion and wealth creation, on the one hand, and other socially desirable objectives 
on the other. This is a difficult balancing act, and reasonable people will arrive at 
different conclusions.
ANALYZING ETHICAL DILEMMAS
Ethical, social, and political controversies usually present themselves as dilemmas. A 
dilemma is a situation in which there are at least two diametrically opposed actions, 
each of which supports a desirable outcome. When confronted with a situation that 
seems to present an ethical dilemma, how can you analyze and reason about the situ-
ation? The following is a five-step process that should help:
	1.	 Identify and clearly describe the facts. Find out who did what to whom, and 
where, when, and how. In many instances, you will be surprised at the errors 
in the initially reported facts, and often you will find that simply getting the 
facts straight helps define the solution. It also helps to get the opposing parties 
involved in an ethical dilemma to agree on the facts.
	2.	 Define the conflict or dilemma and identify the higher-order values 
involved. Ethical, social, and political issues always reference higher values. 
Otherwise, there would be no debate. The parties to a dispute all claim to be pur-
suing higher values (e.g., freedom, privacy, protection of property, and the free 
enterprise system). For example, supporters of the use of advertising networks 
such as DoubleClick argue that the tracking of consumer movements on the Web 
increases market efficiency and the wealth of the entire society. Opponents argue 
this claimed efficiency comes at the expense of individual privacy, and advertis-
ing networks should cease their activities or offer web users the option of not 
participating in such tracking.
	 3.	 Identify the stakeholders. Every ethical, social, and political issue has stake-
holders: players in the game who have an interest in the outcome, who have 
invested in the situation, and usually who have vocal opinions. Find out the iden-
tity of these groups and what they want. This will be useful later when designing 
a solution.
	4.	 Identify the options that you can reasonably take. You may find that none 
of the options satisfies all the interests involved, but that some options do a 
better job than others. Sometimes, arriving at a “good” or ethical solution may 
not always be a balancing of consequences to stakeholders.
	 5.	 Identify the potential consequences of your options. Some options may 
be ethically correct but disastrous from other points of view. Other options may 
work in this one instance but not in other similar instances. Always ask yourself, 
“What if I choose this option consistently over time?”
Once your analysis is complete, you can refer to the following well-established 
ethical principles to help decide the matter.

CANDIDATE ETHICAL PRINCIPLES
Although you are the only one who can decide which ethical principles you will follow 
and how you will prioritize them, it is helpful to consider some ethical principles with 
deep roots in many cultures that have survived throughout recorded history:
•	 The Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Putting 
yourself into the place of others and thinking of yourself as the object of the deci-
sion can help you think about fairness in decision making.
•	 Universalism: If an action is not right for all situations, then it is not right for any 
specific situation (Immanuel Kant’s categorical imperative). Ask yourself, “If we 
adopted this rule in every case, could the organization, or society, survive?”
•	 Slippery Slope: If an action cannot be taken repeatedly, then it is not right to 
take at all. An action may appear to work in one instance to solve a problem, but if 
repeated, would result in a negative outcome. In plain English, this rule might be 
stated as “once started down a slippery path, you may not be able to stop.”
•	 Collective Utilitarian Principle: Take the action that achieves the greater value 
for all of society. This rule assumes you can prioritize values in a rank order and 
understand the consequences of various courses of action.
•	 Risk Aversion: Take the action that produces the least harm, or the least potential 
cost. Some actions have extremely high failure costs of very low probability (e.g., 
building a nuclear generating facility in an urban area) or extremely high failure 
costs of moderate probability (speeding and automobile accidents). Avoid the high-
failure cost actions and choose those actions whose consequences would not be 
catastrophic, even if there were a failure.
•	 No Free Lunch: Assume that virtually all tangible and intangible objects are owned 
by someone else unless there is a specific declaration otherwise. (This is the ethical 
“no free lunch” rule.) If something someone else has created is useful to you, it 
has value and you should assume the creator wants compensation for this work.
•	 The New York Times Test (Perfect Information Rule): Assume that the results 
of your decision on a matter will be the subject of the lead article in the New York 
Times the next day. Will the reaction of readers be positive or negative? Would 
your parents, friends, and children be proud of your decision? Most criminals and 
unethical actors assume imperfect information, and therefore they assume their 
decisions and actions will never be revealed. When making decisions involving 
ethical dilemmas, it is wise to assume perfect information markets.
•	 The Social Contract Rule: Would you like to live in a society where the principle 
you are supporting would become an organizing principle of the entire society? For 
instance, you might think it is wonderful to download illegal copies of Hollywood 
movies, but you might not want to live in a society that does not respect property 
rights, such as your property rights to the car in your driveway, or your rights to a 
term paper or original art.
None of these rules is an absolute guide, and there are exceptions and logical dif-
ficulties with all of them. Nevertheless, actions that do not easily pass these guidelines

deserve some very close attention and a great deal of caution because the appearance 
of unethical behavior may do as much harm to you and your company as the actual 
behavior.
Now that you have an understanding of some basic ethical reasoning concepts, 
let’s take a closer look at each of the major types of ethical, social, and political debates 
that have arisen in e-commerce.
	 8.2	
PRIVACY AND INFORMATION RIGHTS
Privacy is arguably the most complex ethical issue raised by e-commerce, as well as 
the changing technology of human communications brought on by the Internet and 
mobile devices. It may be the most delicate and vexing issue of our digital age, one 
that will continue to evolve through this century. How can we square the ever-growing 
power of digital technologies to gather personal information by businesses and gov-
ernment with the notion that individuals have the right to be left alone, free to think 
what they want without fear? 
In ways not anticipated by technologists or politicians, these digital technologies 
and devices have become the primary means of personal interaction with other people 
and firms. The smartphone and Internet are now at the center of social, political, and 
business life. In the fast-growing online marketplace for goods and services, these 
technologies efficiently and faithfully record human market behavior in ways never 
imagined. The resulting trove of personal private information gathered by online 
merchants has no precedent in history. Laws and regulations to govern the use of this 
information are weak and poorly defined. As a result, consumers often feel they have 
lost control over their personal information online. And, indeed, they have. 
WHAT IS PRIVACY?
The claim to privacy rests on the moral right of individuals to be left alone, free 
from surveillance or interference from other individuals or organizations, including 
the state. Privacy is one girder supporting freedom: without the privacy required to 
think, write, plan, and associate independently and without fear, social and political 
freedom is weakened, and perhaps destroyed. 
Information privacy is a subset of privacy that rests on four central premises. 
First, individuals have a moral right to be able to control the use of whatever informa-
tion is collected about them, whether or not they consented to the gathering of infor-
mation in the first place. Individuals should be able to edit, delete, and shape the use 
of their online personal information by governments and business firms. In this view, 
individuals even have the “right to be forgotten,” as discussed in the opening case 
(Rosen, 2012).
Second, individuals have a moral right to know when information is being col-
lected about them, and must give their consent prior to collecting their personal infor-
mation. This is the principle of “informed consent,” that people are rational actors who

are informed, and who will make their own choices in the marketplace, including the 
decision whether to give their information in return for some benefit. 
Third, individuals have a right to personal information due process. The process 
of collecting, sharing, disseminating personal information must be “fair” and transpar-
ent to everyone. Systems of personal information—whether public or private—must 
be publicly known (no secret systems), operate according to a published set of rules 
(terms of use policies) describing how governments and firms will use personal infor-
mation, and define ways in which people can edit, correct, and shape their personal 
information in a system of records. 
Fourth, individuals have a right to have their personal information stored in a 
secure manner. Personal record systems must have procedures in place to protect 
personal information from intrusion, hacking, and unauthorized uses. 
These principles of personal information privacy are reflected in a doctrine called 
Fair Information Practices (FIP), established by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 
in 2000 (see Table 8.2). We discuss the role of the FTC in protecting personal private 
information further later in the chapter. 
PRIVACY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR: PRIVACY RIGHTS OF CITIZENS
The concept and practice of privacy, and its legal foundation, are very different in 
the public versus the private sector. In the public sector, concepts of privacy have a 
long history that has evolved over two centuries of court rulings, laws, and regulations 
in the United States and Europe. In the private sector, concepts of privacy are much 
more recent, and in the age of the Internet, in a state of flux, debate, and argument. 
	
TABLE 8.2	
THE FTC’S FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICE PRINCIPLES
Notice/Awareness (core 
principle)
Sites must disclose their information practices before collecting 
data. Includes identification of collector, uses of data, other 
recipients of data, nature of collection (active/inactive), voluntary 
or required, consequences of refusal, and steps taken to protect 
confidentiality, integrity, and quality of the data.
Choice/Consent (core 
principle)
There must be a choice regime in place allowing consumers to 
choose how their information will be used for secondary purposes 
other than supporting the transaction, including internal use and 
transfer to third parties. Opt-in/opt-out must be available.
Access/Participation
Consumers should be able to review and contest the accuracy and 
completeness of data collected about them in a timely, 
inexpensive process.
Security
Data collectors must take reasonable steps to assure that 
consumer information is accurate and secure from unauthorized 
use.
Enforcement
There must be a mechanism to enforce FIP principles in place. This 
can involve self-regulation, legislation giving consumers legal 
remedies for violations, or federal statutes and regulation.

The claim to individual privacy in the public sector, the arena of politics, power, 
and authority, is largely a European and American phenomenon that started as an 
attempt to limit the power of political executive leaders—kings, despots, and presi-
dents, and to establish an acceptable relationship between citizens and their leaders. 
In the United States, these claims were written into the Constitution and the Bill 
of Rights. The First Amendment guarantees citizens freedom of speech, association, 
and religion, and prohibits Congress from passing any laws that challenge these rights. 
The Fourth Amendment prohibits government agents from unreasonable searches 
and seizures of a citizen’s premises, and requires a court-sanctioned warrant based 
on probable cause prior to any search of a person’s premises. Much later, the Fourth 
Amendment was extended beyond the home to a very limited set of physical places. 
Warrants are not required when consent is given, for most motor vehicle searches, 
or when evidence is in plain view. The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from 
passing laws that deprive persons of life, liberty, or property, which the courts have 
interpreted as protecting the privacy of personal behavior in the home. 
The word privacy is not mentioned in these founding documents, but it is con-
sidered to be necessary (implicit) for these amendments to mean anything. If privacy 
is denied, then freedom of speech, association, and religion is not possible. If one’s 
premises cannot be protected against unreasonable searches by government, then 
there is no privacy. 
However, relying on court decisions involving the Constitution to protect indi-
viduals has turned out to be inadequate in modern times. The founding documents 
of the 18th century did not define the rights of individuals to their personal informa-
tion collected by government agencies in the routine course of administration, or the 
rights of citizens to obtain documents created by government agencies. There were 
no systems of records containing personal information in the 18th and 19th centuries, 
and government documents were routinely denied to inquisitive reporters and ordi-
nary citizens by executive fiat and convenience. In 1974, Congress passed an omnibus 
Privacy Act, which for the first time defined the privacy rights of a citizen vis-à-vis 
federal government record systems. The Privacy Act regulates the collection and use 
of data collected by federal agencies and defines fair information practices applicable 
to federal government systems such as those created by the Internal Revenue Service 
and the Social Security Administration. It’s important to remember that Privacy Act 
protections apply only to government intrusions on privacy, not private firms’ collec-
tion and use of personal information. 
In addition to the Privacy Act, there are also a host of other federal laws (and 
state laws) that protect individuals against unreasonable government intrusions (see 
Table 8.3 for a list of federal privacy laws that apply to the U.S. government). These 
statutes attempt to implement Fair Information Practices in a wide variety of public 
systems of personal information. 
PRIVACY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR: PRIVACY RIGHTS OF CONSUMERS
When the first large-scale, nationwide computerized systems began to appear in the 
United States in the 1960s, privacy issues and claims rose. For instance, credit card 
systems for the first time gave retail merchants and financial institutions the ability

to systematically collect digital information on consumer behavior. For the first time 
there were very large private national databases that contained a history of whatever 
people purchased, from whom, and where. Large national private credit rating agen-
cies appeared and began developing consumer credit histories, with details on personal 
finances from credit card to loan payments. These developments led to the first efforts 
to claim a right to consumer privacy. Other institutions within the education, health, 
and financial services sectors also began creating very large scale databases involving 
millions of citizens. There followed a host of federal and state legislation that applied 
to specific industries from credit reporting, finance, and health, to video stores (see 
Table 8.4). The pattern of protecting privacy in the United States is not with a general

Online privacy policies
The California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003 was the first state law in the United 
States requiring owners of commercial websites or online services to post a privacy policy. 
The policy must, among other things, identify the categories of PII collected about site visitors 
and categories of third parties with whom the information may be shared. Failure to comply 
can result in a civil suit for unfair business practices. Nebraska and Pennsylvania prohibit 
false and misleading statements in online privacy policies. At least 16 states require 
government websites to establish privacy policies or procedures or incorporate machine-
readable privacy policies into their websites.
Spyware legislation
A number of states, including California, Utah, Arizona, Arkansas, and Virginia, among others, 
have passed laws that outlaw the installation of spyware on a user’s computer without 
consent.
Disclosure of security breaches
In 2002, California enacted legislation that requires state agencies or businesses that own or 
license computer data with personal information to notify state residents if they experience a 
security breach involving that information; today, nearly every state has enacted similar 
legislation. 
Privacy of personal information
Two states, Nevada and Minnesota, require ISPs to keep their customers’ PII private unless 
the customer consents to disclose the information. Minnesota also requires ISPs to get 
permission from subscribers before disclosing information about subscribers’ online surfing 
habits.
Data encryption
In 2007, Nevada passed the first law that requires encryption for the transmission of 
customer personal information. The law took effect October 1, 2008.

privacy statute covering all record systems, but instead to develop privacy statutes 
piecemeal, one industry at a time, as abuses become known. 
While there is a very long history to the discussion of privacy in the public sector 
in Europe and the United States, and a more recent history of applying these ideas to 
very large scale private institutions (such as banks, medical providers, and insurance 
companies), the same is not true of consumer privacy in public markets. E-commerce 
is based on online markets and transactions. Since village markets appeared in ancient 
villages, to the present day, there rarely has been a claim to privacy in public, open 
markets. Think about the local farmers markets today: few, if any, people claim that 
what they purchase is private, or that others should not see what they are buying or 
the prices they pay. Merchants in public markets collected personal information in the 
course of commerce. “Knowing your customer” meant knowing the name, personal 
preferences, interests, purchases, and background of consumers. Consumer behavior 
in public markets was not protected by common law or our founding documents. 
Yet no one anticipated the rise of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and other 
e-commerce companies that collect personal information on nearly the entire popula-
tion of the United States (and the world). No one anticipated that e-commerce would 
involve over 200 million people in the United States; that a single company would 
dominate book sales (Amazon) or movie rentals (Netflix); that a single company would 
dominate the online search market and gather very detailed data on consumer inten-
tions and interests (Google); or that a single firm would become a repository of the 
social life of billions of people (Facebook). The emergence of the Internet, the Web, 
and now smartphones, and their use in truly huge online markets involving most 
of the American population, has greatly enlarged the ability of merchants, financial 
institutions, and marketing firms to gather digital consumer data, use it for their own 
commercial purposes, and potentially abuse that information. These same forces have 
also spurred the growth of demands for the protection of consumer personal privacy 
in the digital era. 
As it turns out, the Internet and the Web provide an ideal environment for both 
business and government to invade the personal privacy of millions of consumers on 
a scale unprecedented in history. Perhaps no other recent issue has raised as much 
widespread social and political concern as protecting the privacy of 267 million Inter-
net users of all ages in the United States.
Information Collected by Websites
As you have learned in previous chapters, e-commerce sites routinely collect a variety 
of information from or about consumers who visit their site and/or make purchases. 
Some of this data constitutes personally identifiable information (PII), which is 
defined as any data that can be used to identify, locate, or contact an individual 
(Federal Trade Commission, 2000). Other data is anonymous information, where 
the identity of the person is not a name but an assigned code. This anonymous infor-
mation includes demographic and behavioral information, such as age, occupation, 
income, zip code, ethnicity, and web browsing behavior without identifying who you 
are. Table 8.5 lists just a few of the personal identifiers routinely collected by online 
personally identifiable 
information (PII)

e-commerce sites including mobile sites and apps. This is not an exhaustive list, and 
in fact, many websites collect hundreds of different data points on visitors. For 
instance, a study of nine data brokers identified twelve broad categories of information 
collected by brokers, and 240 data elements from address history, to liens and political 
leanings, to vehicle and travel data (Federal Trade Commission, 2014). Although anon-
ymous, this detailed information is still “personal,” and a name identifier can be 
attached to the information quite easily. In general, however, online advertisers and 
merchants are less interested in your name than in your buying behavior. 
Advertising networks and search engines also track the behavior of consumers 
across thousands of popular sites, not just at one site, via cookies, web beacons, track-
ing software, spyware, and other techniques. For instance, simply clicking a Like 
button on a website enables Facebook to track your movements across the Web.
Table 8.6 illustrates some of the major ways online firms gather information 
about consumers.
Key Issues in Online Privacy of Consumers 
In recent polls, 90% of Americans are concerned about their online privacy, and 91% 
believe they have lost control over their online information (Pew Research Center, 
2016a). High on the list of public concerns are four aspects of privacy: profiling (and 
the use of profiles to target ads), social network privacy, sharing of information by mar-
keters, and mobile phone privacy. On the other hand, Americans have nuanced views 
about when it is appropriate for firms and government to gather their personal infor-
mation in return for benefits. More than half (54%) of Americans thinks it acceptable 
to monitor employees in order to have a safer workplace, to share health information 
with providers and insurance companies, to share certain personal information with 
online social networks, and for the government to conduct surveillance of citizens in 
order to identify terrorists. But only 24% support a home thermostat that would track 
movements around the house. By large majorities, most Americans do not trust private

Marketing: Profiling, Behavioral Targeting, and Retargeting
Around 267 million Americans regularly go online. Marketers would like to know who 
these people are, what they are interested in, and what they buy. The more precise 
and complete the information, the more valuable it is as a predictive and marketing 
tool. Armed with this information, marketers can make their ad campaigns more 
efficient by targeting specific ads at specific groups or individuals, and they can even 
adjust the ads for specific groups. 
Most popular websites allow third parties—including online advertising networks 
such as DoubleClick, Microsoft Advertising, and others—to place “third-party” cookies 
and web tracking software on a visitor’s computer in order to engage in profiling the 
user’s behavior across thousands of other websites that are also members of the adver-
tising network. Profiling is the creation of data images (a collection of data records 
used to create behavioral profiles of consumers) that characterize online individual 
and group behavior. Anonymous profiles identify people as belonging to highly 
specific and targeted groups, for example, 20- to 30-year-old males, with college degrees 
and incomes greater than $30,000 a year, and interested in high-fashion clothing (based 
on recent search engine use). Personal profiles add a personal e-mail address, postal 
address, and/or phone number to behavioral data. Increasingly, online firms are 
linking their online profiles to personal offline consumer data collected by database 
firms tracking credit card purchases, as well as established retail and catalog firms. As

you learned in Chapter 6, behavioral targeting is the use of personal profile informa-
tion to determine which ads a consumer will see online. Retargeting is the practice of 
showing consumers the same ad on many different websites they visit. For instance, 
if you use Google to search for a new kitchen clock, ads for kitchen clocks will follow 
you to Yahoo, Facebook, and thousands of other sites you browse. 
The online advertising networks have added several new dimensions to estab-
lished offline marketing techniques. First, they have the ability to precisely track not 
just consumer purchases, but all online browsing behavior at thousands of websites, 
including browsing book lists, filling out preference forms, and viewing content pages. 
Second, they can dynamically adjust what the shopper sees on screen—including 
prices. Third, they can build and continually refresh high-resolution data images. Most 
computers have hundreds of these programs installed without consumer consent or 
understanding. 
A different kind of profiling and a more recent form of behavioral targeting is 
Google’s results-based personalization of advertising. Google has a patent on a program 
that allows advertisers using Google’s AdWords program to target ads to users based 
on their prior search histories and profiles, which Google constructs based on user 
searches, along with any other information the user submits to Google or that Google 
can obtain, such as age, demographics, region, and other online activities (such as 
blogging). Google also has a second patent on a program that allows Google to help 
advertisers select keywords and design ads for various market segments based on 
search histories, such as helping a clothing website create and test ads targeted at 
teenage females. Google uses behavioral targeting to help it display more relevant 
ads based on keywords. According to Google, the feature is aimed at capturing a more 
robust understanding of user intent, and thereby delivering a better ad. For instance, 
Google’s Gmail, a free e-mail service, offers a powerful interface, and gigabytes of free 
storage. In return, Google computers read all incoming and outgoing e-mail and place 
“relevant” advertising in the margins of the mail. Profiles are developed on individual 
users based on the content in their e-mail. 
Both American and European regulators have objected to Google’s policy of inte-
grating personal information from all of its services into a single personal profile, 
and second, failing to let users know what it is doing with their personal information 
(Charlton, 2013). Google claims that people who send mail to a friend’s Gmail account 
do not have an expectation of privacy, and that anyone who sends information to a 
third party does not have an expectation of privacy. Privacy groups expressed concerns 
when Google announced in 2014 that it was purchasing Nest, the maker of digital home 
thermostats and smoke detection devices that are connected to the Internet. Although 
Nest says it is run separately from Google and that Nest accounts are not cross-linked 
with Google accounts, Nest admits that it does share personal information with Google 
when connected to Google’s “Works with Nest integration” system (Gibbs, 2015a). 
Facial recognition software adds a new dimension to profiling and behavioral 
targeting. In 2016, several uses of facial recognition are already commonplace. Face-
book and Google+ use the software to automatically suggest name tags for members 
or their friends in photographs. Department stores, hotels, and law enforcement use 
this technology without consent. Originally developed as a tool to recognize terrorists 

	
P r i v a c y  a n d  I n f o r m a t i o n  R i g h t s 	

515
in the field, local police departments have widely adopted the technology to identify 
wanted persons, finding it much faster than fingerprint databases (Williams, 2015). 
The technology is evolving rapidly: Google has applied for a patent to identify faces 
in online videos, and Facebook has developed a highly accurate facial recognition 
system called DeepFace (Singer, 2014a). It is difficult for people to detect if they are 
being stalked or followed by persons using facial recognition technology, and currently 
there are no controls over its use (Consumer Reports, 2016). 
Network advertising firms argue that online profiling and targeting ads benefits 
both consumers and businesses. Profiling permits targeting of ads, ensuring that con-
sumers see advertisements mostly for products and services in which they are actually 
interested. Businesses benefit by not paying for wasted advertising sent to consumers 
who have no interest in their product or service. The industry argues that by increas-
ing the effectiveness of advertising, more advertising revenues go to the Internet, 
which in turn subsidizes free content on the Internet. Last, product designers and 
entrepreneurs benefit by sensing demand for new products and services by examin-
ing user searches and profiles. 
Critics argue that profiling undermines the expectation of anonymity and privacy 
that most people have when using the Internet, and changes what should be a private 
experience into one where an individual’s every move is recorded. As people become 
aware that their every move is being watched, they will be far less likely to explore 
sensitive topics, browse pages, or read about controversial issues. How can people 
experience freedom if they believe their every move on the Internet is being watched? 
In most cases, the profiling is invisible to users, and even hidden. Consumers are not 
notified that profiling is occurring. Profiling permits data aggregation on hundreds or 
even thousands of unrelated sites on the Web. 
Critics debate the economic benefits of profiling because it allows firms to engage 
in price discrimination, charging more for goods based on, for instance, zip code, 
gender, and ethnicity (Singer, 2015). The cookies placed by ad networks are persistent, 
and they can be set to last days, months, years, or even forever. Their tracking occurs 
over an extended period of time and resumes each time the individual logs on to the 
Internet. This clickstream data is used to create profiles that can include hundreds of 
distinct data fields for each consumer. Associating so-called anonymous profiles with 
personal information is fairly easy, and companies can change policies quickly without 
informing the consumer. Although the information gathered by network advertisers 
is often anonymous (non-PII data), in many cases, the profiles derived from tracking 
consumers’ activities on the Web are linked or merged with personally identifiable 
information. Anonymous behavioral data is far more valuable if it can be linked with 
names, offline consumer behavior, e-mail addresses, and postal addresses. 
The Harm of False Data: That’s Not Me!
In 2014, Thomas Robins, a California man, sued Spokeo, a company that sells personal 
data online to employers, and individuals looking for information on prospective 
partners. Robins sued based on a section of the Fair Credit Reporting Act that pro-
vides damages of up to $1,000 against data gathering firms if these reports are false 
and cause concrete harm, even if the harm cannot be quantified. Robins claimed

C H A P T E R  8     E t h i c a l ,  S o c i a l ,  a n d  P o l i t i c a l  I s s u e s  i n  E - c o m m e r c e
the profile distributed by Spokeo was substantially erroneous, claiming that he was 
employed, married, had children, and held a graduate degree. None of this was true. 
Robins claims this false data potentially caused him to lose employment and other 
opportunities although he had no evidence he had experienced any real world harm. 
Robins also claimed the right to organize a class action group composed of people 
similarly harmed. A lower court agreed with Robins and his right to organize a class 
action suit for others similarly harmed. In May 2016, the Supreme Court decided not 
to decide the case, but remanded it back to the lower court with instructions to more 
precisely define “concrete” harm, suggesting it must actually exist and be a real harm 
(Spokeo v. Robins,  578 U.S. ___ (2016)). Real harm, the court agreed, could include 
intangible harms, and the risk of real harm in the future. The majority argued that 
mere procedural errors, like misreporting a person’s zip code, or minor errors, would 
not constitute a real harm. Business groups support the Supreme Court’s position vis-
à-vis Spokeo, arguing that it would cost billions of dollars to defend against these suits, 
and that people should not be able to bring class action law suits without showing real 
harm. Privacy advocates argue that individuals should have the right to sue businesses 
for spreading false information about them. Currently, the law in this area of false 
data is still evolving (Liptak, 2016).
Social Networks: Privacy and Self Revelation
Social networks pose a unique challenge for the maintenance of personal privacy 
because they encourage people to reveal details about their personal lives (passions, 
loves, favorites, photos, videos, and personal interests), and to share them with their 
friends. Social networks have greatly enlarged the depth, scope, and richness of infor-
mation collected by private corporations. While Google’s search engine is a massive 
database of personal intentions, Facebook has created a massive database of friends, 
preferences, Likes, posts, and activities. An Austrian researcher was able to obtain his 
Facebook file (possible under European laws) and received a 1,222-page document of 
messages, photos, posts, and friends (Sengupta, 2012). Some social networkers share 
these personal details with everyone on the social network. On the face of it, this 
would seem to indicate that people who participate in social networks voluntarily give 
up their rights to personal privacy. How could they claim an expectation of privacy? 
When everything is shared, what’s private? 
But the reality is that many adult participants in social networks have a very 
keen sense of their personal privacy. Facebook is a prime example of senior manage-
ment pushing the envelope of privacy, and experiencing a number of public relations 
reversals and growing government concern. For instance, Facebook deployed facial 
recognition technology without any previous notice, which compromised its users’ 
privacy by allowing them to be tagged in photos without their consent. Researchers 
at Carnegie Mellon found that it is possible to identify people, even their social secu-
rity numbers, based on a single Facebook photograph and using facial recognition 
programs (Angwin, 2011; Acquisti et al., 2011). After numerous consumer complaints, 
and challenges from various state attorneys general, Facebook reversed course and 
made it easier for users to opt out of the technology. In 2012, Facebook began pushing 
ads on its users based on their use of apps and offering advertisers the ability to serve 

	
P r i v a c y  a n d  I n f o r m a t i o n  R i g h t s

517
ads to Facebook users even while not using Facebook. In 2013, Facebook announced 
a new privacy policy that it claimed clarified its use of personal information. In the 
new policy, Facebook claimed it could use any personal information for any purpose 
it wanted to. After howls of protest from users, privacy groups, and congressmen, 
the policy was temporarily withdrawn. In 2014, Facebook changed its default privacy 
settings to reveal information only to friends, and allowed users to see some of the 
data Facebook collects about them and to edit that data. Researchers have found that 
actually performing these tasks is quite difficult. In early 2015, Facebook implemented 
new privacy policies that stipulate that it may share users’ personal data with part-
nered sites for the delivery of targeted ads. Also in 2015 Facebook changed the privacy 
policy for its WhatsApp  app to permit the site to own and share whatever content 
users post, including photos as well as messages that were supposed to disappear in 
a few minutes. For a review of Facebook’s various positions on online privacy over 
the years, and public and congressional reaction to these issues, refer to the Insight 
on Society case, Facebook and the Age of Privacy, in Chapter 1. 
The result of these public conflicts suggests that social network participants do 
indeed have a strong expectation of privacy in the sense that they want to control 
how “their” information is used. People who contribute user-generated content have 
a strong sense of ownership over the content that is not diminished by posting the 
information on a social network for one’s friends. As for members who post informa-
tion to everyone, not just friends, these should be seen as “public performances” where 
the contributors voluntarily publish their performances, just as writers or other artists. 
In these situations, the claim to privacy is not credible. 
Mobile Devices: Location-Based Privacy Issues 
As the mobile platform becomes more and more important, issues about mobile and 
location-based privacy are also becoming a major concern. In 2012, investigators 
discovered that iOS and Android apps were funneling location information to mobile 
advertisers, along with users’ address books and photos (Bilton, 2012). As a result, Con-
gress opened an investigation into the privacy policies of smartphone manufacturers, 
along with Facebook, Pinterest, Yahoo, Google, and 30 others in the app marketplace. 
Twitter announced that anyone using its “Find Friends” feature on smartphones was 
also sending every phone number and e-mail address in their address books to the 
company (Sarno, 2012). 
In 2011 reporters discovered that Apple iPhones and iPads and Google Android 
smartphones were able to track and store user location information. In 2012, Facebook 
launched a new mobile advertising service that tracks what apps people use on their 
smartphones, and what they do while using the apps. Apple and Google track users’ 
apps also. Apple disclosed that it can target ads based on the apps that a person has 
downloaded, while Google does not currently do this. For instance, Facebook can target 
a frequent player of a game such as Words with Friends with ads using the player’s 
Facebook News Feed, which is a major channel for Facebook ads. In 2012, investigators 
discovered that some cell phone companies had installed tracking devices inside phones 
to improve customer service. In short, smartphones, by their very nature, quickly 
became storehouses of personal information that users were initially unaware of.

In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a path-breaking unanimous decision, ruled 
that police needed a warrant prior to searching a person’s cell phone for information. 
All mobile devices will likely receive this protection against general, warrantless 
police searches (Savage, 2014). An earlier decision in 2012 requires police to obtain a 
warrant prior to attaching GPS tracking devices to a suspect’s car. In both cases, the 
Supreme Court found that cell phones held extensive detailed personal information, 
retained information for many years, and stored many different types of information. 
Much of a person’s intimate and personal life can be stored on cell phones, or cloud 
servers, making them the modern equivalent of personal papers, which are protected 
under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution (“right of the people to be secure 
in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and sei-
zures”). The U.S. Senate held hearings on proposed legislation (the Consumer Location 
Privacy Protection Act), which requires firms to notify cell phone users and obtain 
their consent if they want to gather location data. This legislation was never passed. 
The FTC signed a 20-year consent order with Snapchat after discovering the app was 
collecting location data contrary to Snapchat’s own privacy policy. 
Refer to the Insight on Society case, Foursquare: Check Your Privacy at the Door, 
in Chapter 2, for more discussion of some of the issues associated with mobile and 
location-based privacy. 
Consumer Privacy Regulation: The FTC
In the United States, the FTC has taken the lead in conducting research on online 
privacy and recommending legislation to Congress. The FTC is a cabinet-level agency 
charged with promoting the efficient functioning of the marketplace by protecting 
consumers from unfair or deceptive practices and increasing consumer choice by 
promoting competition. In addition to reports and recommendations, the FTC enforces 
existing legislation by suing corporations it believes are in violation of federal trade 
laws, and in some cases, by imposing a federal monitor or reporting system to ensure 
the firm complies with agency rulings. The FTC also makes recommendations to 
Congress for new consumer privacy legislation. 
Earlier in this section we described the FTC’s Fair Information Practice (FIP) 
principles (see Table 8.2), on which it bases its assessments of how well firms are 
protecting consumer privacy. The FTC’s FIP principles set the ground rules for what 
constitutes due process privacy protection procedures at e-commerce and all other 
websites—including government and nonprofit websites—in the United States. Embed-
ded within FIP principles is the concept of informed consent (defined as consent 
given with knowledge of all material facts needed to make a rational decision). There 
are traditionally two models for informed consent: opt-in and opt-out. The opt-in 
model requires an affirmative action by the consumer to allow collection and use of 
information. For instance, using opt-in, consumers would first be asked if they 
approved of the collection and use of information, and then directed to check a selec-
tion box if they agreed. Otherwise, the default is not to approve the collection of data. 
In the opt-out model, the default is to collect information unless the consumer takes 
an affirmative action to prevent the collection of data by checking a box or by filling 
out a form. In the United States, most e-commerce companies that offer informed 
informed consent
consent given with knowl-
edge of all material facts 
needed to make a rational 
decision
opt-in model
requires an affirmative 
action by the consumer to 
allow collection and use of 
consumer information
opt-out model
the default is to collect 
information unless the 
consumer takes an affirma-
tive action to prevent the 
collection of data

consent use the opt-out model. Unless the consumer checks a box to specifically 
decline, information is collected. Often, the selection box is at the very bottom of the 
web page, where the consumer is unlikely to see it, or located within complex menus. 
The FTC’s FIP principles are guidelines, not laws. In the United States, for 
example, business firms can gather transaction information generated in the market-
place and then use that information for other purposes, without obtaining the explicit 
affirmative informed consent of the individual. In Europe, this would be illegal. A 
business in Europe cannot use marketplace transaction information for any purpose 
other than supporting the current transaction, unless it obtains the individual’s consent 
in writing or by filling out an on-screen form. 
However, the FTC’s FIP guidelines are often used as the basis of legislation. The 
most important online privacy legislation to date that has been directly influenced 
by the FTC’s FIP principles is the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) 
(1998), which requires websites to obtain parental permission before collecting infor-
mation on children under 13 years of age. 
In the last decade, the FTC has broadened its approach to privacy beyond notice, 
informed consent, and opt-in/opt-out choice requirements to include a harm-based 
approach, focusing on practices that are likely to cause harm or unwarranted intrusion 
in consumers’ daily lives. In several reports the FTC has recognized the limitations 
of its earlier FIP approach. It has found that “informed consent” is not effective when 
consumers do not know about, or understand, online firms’ data collection practices. 
Consumers do not understand, and often fear, bring tracked from one website to 
another. Online firms often change their privacy policies without notice, and these 
policies are written in obscure language that confuses consumers. The FTC has also 
found the distinction between personal information and anonymous information to be 
invalid because it is easy for firms to identify consumers personally by name, email, 
and address based on so-called anonymous data. As a result the FTC developed a new 
framework to address consumer privacy. Table 8.8 summarizes the important aspects 
of this framework. 
The FTC also supports a “Do Not Track” mechanism for online behavioral adver-
tising. The mechanism would involve placing a persistent cookie on a consumer’s 
browser and conveying its setting to sites that the browser visits to signal whether or 
not the consumer wants to be tracked or receive targeted advertisements. A number 
of bills have been introduced in Congress to implement Do Not Track, but as yet none 
have been passed. Refer to the Insight on Technology case, Every Move You Take, Every 
Click You Make, We’ll Be Tracking You in Chapter 6 for a discussion of the difficulties 
that have developed in implementing Do Not Track.
The FTC’s new aggressive policy on consumer privacy has resulted in several 
judgments and fines. In 2011, the FTC reached an agreement with Google concerning 
charges it used deceptive tactics and violated its own privacy policies when it launched 
its Google Buzz social network, forcing people to join the network even if they selected 
not to join. Under the settlement, Google agreed to start a privacy program, permit 
independent privacy audits for 20 years, and face $16,000 fines for every future privacy 
misrepresentation. This was the first time the FTC had charged a company with such 
violations and ordered it to start a privacy program (Federal Trade Commission, 2011).

In 2012, the FTC fined Google $22.5 million for violating the agreement and for bypass-
ing privacy settings in Apple’s Safari browser in order to track users and show them 
advertisements. This fine—its largest civil penalty to date—followed on the heels of a 
concerted crackdown on tech companies for privacy violations and a separate investi-
gation of Google for antitrust violations (Federal Trade Commission, 2012a). The FTC 
also reached a settlement with Facebook resolving charges that Facebook deceived its 
users by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, but then 
repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public. The settlement requires Facebook 
to live up to its promises by giving consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain-
ing their express consent before sharing their information beyond the user’s privacy 
settings. It also requires Facebook to develop a comprehensive privacy program, and

P R I N C I P L E
A P P L I C A T I O N
Scope
Applies to all commercial entities that collect or use consumer data; not 
limited to those that just collect PII.
Privacy by Design
Companies should promote consumer privacy throughout the organization 
and at every stage of development of products and services:
•	 Data security
•	 Reasonable collection limits
•	 Reasonable and appropriate data retention policies
•	 Data accuracy
•	 Comprehensive data management procedures
Simplified Choice
Companies should simplify consumer choice. Need not provide choice 
before collecting and using data for commonly accepted practices:
•	 Product and fulfillment
•	 Internal operations, fraud prevention
•	 Legal compliance
•	 First-party marketing
For all other commercial data collection and use, choice is required, and 
should be clearly and conspicuously offered at a time and in context in 
which consumer is providing data.
Some types of information or practices (children, financial and medical 
information, deep packet inspection) may require additional protection 
through enhanced consent.
Special choice mechanism for online behavioral advertising: “Do Not 
Track.”
Greater 
Transparency
Increase transparency of data practices by:
•	 Making privacy notices clearer, shorter, and more standardized to enable 
better comprehension and comparison
•	 Providing consumers with reasonable access to data about themselves
•	 Providing prominent disclosures and obtaining express affirmative consent 
before using consumer data in a materially different manner than claimed 
when data was collected
•	 Educating consumers about commercial data privacy practices

obtain independent biennial privacy audits for a period of 20 years (Federal Trade 
Commission, 2012b).
In 2012, the FTC released another report on consumer privacy. The report 
describes industry best practices for protecting the privacy of Americans and focuses 
on five areas: Do Not Track, mobile privacy, data brokers, large platform providers 
(advertising networks, operating systems, browsers, and social media companies), and 
the development of self-regulatory codes. The report called for implementation of an 
easy-to-use, persistent, and effective Do Not Track system; improved disclosures for use 
of mobile data; making it easier for people to see the files about themselves compiled by 
data brokers; development of a central website where data brokers identify themselves; 
development of a privacy policy by large platform providers to regulate comprehensive 
tracking across the Internet; and enforcement of self-regulatory rules to ensure firms 
adhere to industry codes of conduct (Federal Trade Commission, 2012c). 
In 2014, the FTC issued a report on the data broker industry, which is at the heart 
of the online and offline privacy debate in the United States. The report found that 
data brokers operate without transparency, and most users have no idea how their 
information is being used. The report found that data brokers collect and store billions 
of data elements covering nearly every U.S. consumer. One of the nine data brokers 
studied had information on more than 1.4 billion consumer transactions and 700 billion 
data elements. Another broker adds more than 3 billion new data points to its database 
each month. The report called for legislation giving consumers more control over their 
personal information by creating a centralized portal where data brokers would identify 
themselves, describe their information collection and use practices, and provide links 
to access tools and opt-outs; require brokers to give consumers access to their data; 
provide opportunities to opt-out of data collection; describe where they get information 
and what inferences they make from the data; and require retailers to notify custom-
ers when they share information with data brokers (Federal Trade Commission, 2014). 
The FTC’s most recent emphasis is not on restricting the collection of informa-
tion (as in previous eras of privacy regulation), but instead on giving consumers rights 
with respect to the information collected about them in large databases and its use by 
various businesses and agencies. This is called a “consumer rights-based” privacy policy.
Facing fines, congressional investigations, and public embarrassment over their 
privacy invading behaviors, with the potential loss of some business and credibility, 
the major players in the e-commerce industry in the United States are beginning to 
change some of their policies regarding the treatment of consumer data. Large Inter-
net firms that rely on personal information (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and many 
others), along with privacy advocates, are calling on Washington to develop compre-
hensive consumer privacy protection legislation that would clarify for consumers and 
business firms the meaning of privacy in the current online commercial environment 
(Singer, 2013). This represents a change in the meaning of privacy from “leave me 
alone” to “I want to know and control how my personal information is being used.” 
Consumer Privacy Regulation: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
In 2015, in the context of the controversy over net neutrality (discussed further later 
in this chapter), broadband Internet service providers (ISPs) such as Verizon, Comcast, 

522	
	
C H A P T E R  8     E t h i c a l ,  S o c i a l ,  a n d  P o l i t i c a l  I s s u e s  i n  E - c o m m e r c e
and AT&T, which own the fiber optic cables and networks that are the foundation of the 
Internet, were classified as being like public utility services similar to telephone compa-
nies and hence subject to regulation by the FCC. In 2016, the FCC approved new privacy 
rules applicable to these companies. Up until this time, the focus on Internet privacy 
issues has centered on how websites and apps use personal information. However, these 
giant broadband ISPs have also had access to much of the same information, such as data 
on transactions, location, browsing and app usage, and even social security numbers, 
which they collected without user consent.  The broadband ISPs have been selling this 
information or using it for targeted advertising, just as Google, Facebook, and hundreds 
of other websites and apps, do.  The FCC’s new regulations require broadband ISPs to 
notify users of their new privacy options by e-mail or on their websites and to obtain user 
consent to collect this information.  ISPs are not allowed to offer service contingent on 
consumers surrendering their privacy and cannot deny service to consumers who do not 
permit them to collect personal information (as is typical under Terms of Service poli-
cies for websites).  For the first time in the decades-long debate over Internet privacy, a 
regulatory agency declared that personal information gathered by Internet firms belongs 
to consumers, not the owners of the networks.  The new rules do not apply to websites, 
which are not under FCC regulation (FCC, 2016; King, 2016). 
Privacy Policies
As noted previously, one conceptual basis of American privacy law is notification and 
consent. It is assumed that consumers can read Terms of Use notices (or privacy poli-
cies) concerning how a website will use their personal information, and then make a 
rational choice to either consent to the terms of use, opt out of the data collection (if 
that is an option), or stop using the site. Until recently, many U.S. e-commerce com-
panies rejected the concept of informed consent and instead simply published their 
information use policy on their site. Nearly all websites have Terms of Use policies 
that users can find if they look carefully. These Terms of Use policies are sometimes 
called privacy policies, and they describe how the firms will use information collected 
on their sites. These policies are notices, and as noted above, it is assumed that anyone 
who uses the site has implicitly agreed to the Terms of Use policy. A recent study 
reviewed 30 popular social network and community sites and found that it would take 
the average reader about eight hours to simply read the policy. The longest policy was 
SoundCloud’s, with 7,961 words. Obviously a critical flaw with informed consent as the 
basis of privacy protections is that it assumes the average user can understand what 
privacy they may be giving up by using a site (Singer, 2014b; Fiesler et al., 2014). For 
instance, Yahoo’s privacy policy begins by stating that Yahoo takes the user’s privacy 
seriously and Yahoo does not rent, sell, or share personal information about users 
with others or non-affiliated companies. However, there are a number of exceptions 
that significantly weaken this statement. For instance, Yahoo may share the informa-
tion with “trusted partners,” which could be anyone that Yahoo does business with, 
although perhaps not a company that the user might choose to do business with. In 
its privacy policy, Yahoo also says it uses cookies, device identifiers, and web beacons 
in order to track user clickstream behavior across the Web. To opt-out of interest-based 
advertising, a user must sign into his or her Yahoo account and allow cookies from

523
Yahoo. U.S. businesses argue that informing consumers by publishing a terms of use 
policy is sufficient to establish the users’ informed consent. Privacy advocates argue 
that many terms of use/privacy policy statements on U.S. websites are obscure and 
difficult to read, and legitimate just about any use of personal information. 
While politicians, privacy advocates, and the Internet industry wrangle over what 
the rules for privacy should be, very little attention has been paid to actually mea-
suring the strength of privacy policies for individual companies, comparing them to 
other companies, and understanding how privacy policies have changed over time 
at a specific company. Is Facebook’s privacy policy worse, better, or about the same 
as Apple’s, or Google’s? Have privacy policies improved after ten years of debate, or 
have they deteriorated? 
A recent research project provides some preliminary answers to these questions. 
The researchers developed a measure of privacy policies by applying 10 privacy policy 
principles when reviewing policies (see Table 8.9) (Shore and Steinman, 2015). You 
will recognize these principles because they derive in primary part from the FTC and 
Fair Information Practices doctrines previously described. The dimensions themselves 
were measured on a four-point scale from 0 to 4 (0 meaning the privacy policy fails to 
meet the criterion and 4 indicating the criterion was fully achieved). 
You can use the principles in Table 8.9 as a way to measure the privacy policy of 
your own online business, or another firm like Facebook, or Google. You can measure 
a single firm at two points in time to see how its policies changed, or compare two or 
more firms at a single point in time. Shore and Steinman chose to look at Facebook’s 
privacy policies over a ten-year period from 2005 to 2015. They found that Facebook’s 
privacy policies improved from 2005 to 2009, at one point reaching 90% implementa-
tion of the criterion, and then steadily declined to 25% in 2015. The areas of notable 
decline were the amount of information gathered and monitored, informing users 
about what is shared, clearly identifying data used for profiling, giving users choices 
in privacy settings, providing information on how Facebook uses cookies, beacons, and 
weblogs to gather data, and providing an easily understood privacy policy document. 
The researchers noted that Facebook’s privacy policy started out in 2005 with 1,000 
words, and by 2015 had ballooned to over 12,000 words!
	
TABLE 8.9	
CRITERIA TO USE WHEN EXAMINING PRIVACY POLICIES
•	 Can the privacy policy be easily found, reviewed, and understood by users?
•	 Does the privacy policy fully disclose how personal information will and will not be used by the 
organization? Is information about users ever shared or sold without users’ explicit permission?
•	 Can users decide if they want to participate?
•	 Can users decide and actively indicate that they agree to be profiled, tracked, or targeted?
•	 Can users decide how and if their sensitive information is shared?
•	 Are users able to change any information that they input about themselves?
•	 Can users decide who can access their information?
•	 Are users notified promptly if their information is lost, stolen, or improperly accessed?
•	 Can users easily report concerns and get answers?
•	 Do users receive a copy of all disclosures of their information?

The European Data Protection Directive
In Europe, privacy protection is much stronger than it is in the United States. In the 
United States, private organizations and businesses are permitted to use PII gathered 
in commercial transactions for other business purposes without the prior consent of 
the consumer (so-called secondary uses of PII). In the United States, there is no federal 
agency charged with enforcing privacy laws. Instead, privacy laws are enforced largely 
through self-regulation by businesses, and by individuals who must sue agencies or 
companies in court to recover damages. This is expensive and rarely done. The Euro-
pean approach to privacy protection is more comprehensive and regulatory in nature. 
European countries do not allow business firms to use PII without the prior consent 
of consumers. They enforce their privacy laws by creating data protection agencies to 
pursue complaints brought by citizens and actively enforce privacy laws. 
In 1998, the European Commission’s Data Protection Directive went into effect, 
standardizing and broadening privacy protection in the E.U. nations. The Directive is 
based on the Fair Information Practices doctrine but extends the control individuals can 
exercise over their personal information. The Directive required companies to inform 
people when they collect information about them and to disclose how it will be stored 
and used. Customers had to provide their consent before a company could legally 
use data about them, and they had the right to access that information, correct it, and 
request that no further data be collected. Further, the Directive prohibited the transfer 
of PII to organizations or countries that do not have similarly strong privacy protection 
policies. This meant that data collected in Europe by American business firms could not 
be transferred or processed in the United States (which has weaker privacy protection 
laws). This would have potentially interfered with a $6.9 trillion annual trade flow in 
goods, services, and investment between the United States and Europe.
The U.S. Department of Commerce, working with the European Commission, 
developed a safe harbor framework that permits U.S. firms to move personal data from 
Europe to the United States. A safe harbor is a private self-regulating policy and 
enforcement mechanism that meets the objectives of government regulators and 
legislation but does not involve government regulation or enforcement. The United 
States government played a role in certifying safe harbors, however. However, in 
October 2015, Europe’s highest court struck down the safe harbor agreement entirely, 
in large part due to the revelations by Edward Snowden that Facebook had shared 
personal information on European citizens with the National Security Agency, and 
therefore violated the terms of the agreement (Scott, 2015). 
In 2015, the European Council approved a new E.U. General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) to replace the existing Data Protection Directive. The new GDPR 
(sometimes referred to as the Privacy Shield) took effect in June 2016. The GDPR 
applies across all E.U. countries, rather than the previous situation in which each 
member-state regulates privacy matters within its own borders. The GDPR applies to 
any firm operating in any E.U. country, requires unambiguous consent to use personal 
data for purposes like tracking individuals across the Web, limits the ability to use data 
for purposes other than those for which it was collected (tertiary uses, such as con-
structing user profiles), and strengthens the right to be forgotten, specifically, by 
allowing individuals to remove personal data from social platforms like Facebook, and

prevent them from collecting any new information. Companies operating in the E.U. 
must delete personal information once it no longer serves the purpose for which it 
was collected. In addition, an independent ombudsman has been created to investigate 
complaints and enforce the policy (Drozdiak, 2016; Evans, 2015; Gibbs, 2015b; Euro-
pean Commission, 2014; Pearce and Clarke, 2014; European Commission, 2012). In 
the end, the Privacy Shield is intended to make it relatively easy for businesses col-
lecting data on Europeans to transfer that data to servers based in the United States. 
In 2016, the privacy environment has turned decidedly against American firms 
like Facebook, Google, and others whose business model requires near unfettered use 
of personal information to support advertising revenues. Five E.U. nations (Nether-
lands, Germany, France, Spain, and Belgium) have initiated a series of coordinated 
investigations into these firms’ privacy and data policies. 
For instance, in 2015 Belgium sued Facebook for collecting and processing data 
without user consent, or explaining how it would use the information (Schechner and 
Drozdiak, 2015). France’s privacy data-protection regulator ordered Google to expand 
the right to be forgotten to the entire world, not just to Europeans (Schechner, 2015). 
Dutch, German, and Belgian authorities are investigating Facebook’s combining of 
data from its services like Instagram and WhatsApp to target advertising, and its use 
of its Like buttons for tracking browsing habits across the entire Web.
Industry Self-Regulation
Federal government regulation alone is insufficient to protect consumer privacy. 
The technology evolves quickly, and provides marketers more tools to collect and 
use consumer private information before legislatures and government agencies can 
respond. The online industry in the United States has historically opposed online 
privacy legislation, arguing that industry can do a better job of protecting privacy than 
government. The online industry formed the Online Privacy Alliance (OPA) in 1998 
to encourage self-regulation in part as a reaction to growing public concerns and the 
threat of legislation being proposed by the FTC and privacy advocacy groups. 
OPA has developed a set of privacy guidelines that members are required to imple-
ment. The primary focus of industry efforts has been the development of online “seals” 
that attest to the privacy policies on a site. The Better Business Bureau (BBB), TRUSTe, 
WebTrust, and major accounting firms—among them PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Better-
Web— have established seals for websites. The TRUSTe seal is the most common on the 
Web. To display a seal, website operators must conform to certain privacy principles, 
a complaint resolution process, and monitoring by the seal originator. Nevertheless, 
online privacy seal programs have had a limited impact on online privacy practices. 
Critics argue that seal programs are not particularly effective in safeguarding privacy. 
In 2015, for instance, the FTC finalized a settlement in which it fined TRUSTe for 
failing to annually recertify privacy programs in more than 1,000 instances although 
claiming that it did so on its website (Davis, 2015). For these reasons, the FTC has 
not deemed the seal programs as “safe harbors” and the agency continues to push for 
legislation to enforce privacy protection principles. 
The advertising network industry has also formed an industry association, the 
Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), to develop privacy policies. The NAI policies

have two objectives: to offer consumers a chance to opt out of advertising network pro-
grams (including e-mail campaigns), and to provide consumers redress from abuses. 
In order to opt out, the NAI has created a website—Networkadvertising.org—where 
consumers can use a global opt-out feature to prevent network advertising agencies 
from placing their cookies on a user’s computer. If a consumer has a complaint, the 
NAI has a link to the Truste.org website where the complaints can be filed (Network 
Advertising Initiative, 2010; 2011).
The AdChoices program is another industry-sponsored initiative to encourage 
websites to be more transparent about how they use personal information and to make 
it more likely that appropriate ads are shown to users by asking users themselves. An 
AdChoices icon appears next to ads, and clicking on this icon provides more informa-
tion and the opportunity to provide feedback to the advertiser. There is no data avail-
able yet to indicate how well this program is working. 
In general, industry efforts at self-regulation in online privacy have not succeeded 
in reducing American fears of privacy invasion during online transactions, or in reduc-
ing the level of privacy invasion. At best, self-regulation has offered consumers notice 
about whether a privacy policy exists, but usually says little about the actual use of 
the information, does not offer consumers a chance to see and correct the information 
or control its use in any significant way, offers no promises for the security of that 
information, and offers no enforcement mechanism (Hoofnagle, 2005).
Technological Solutions
A number of privacy-enhancing technologies have been developed for protecting 
user privacy during interactions with websites such as spyware blockers, pop-up 
blockers, cookie managers, and secure e-mail (see Table 8.10). However, the most 
powerful tools for protecting privacy need to be built into browsers. Responding to 
pressure from privacy advocates, browsers now have a number of tools that can help 
users protect their privacy, such as eliminating third-party cookies. Potentially one 
of the most powerful browser-based protections is a built-in Do Not Track capability 
(refer to the Insight on Technology case, Every Move You Take, Every Click You Make, 
We’ll be Tracking You in Chapter 6). Most of these tools emphasize security—the ability 
of individuals to protect their communications and files from illegitimate snoopers. 
Encryption is also potentially an important technology to preserving privacy of mes-
sages and documents. As noted above, Apple implemented encryption of its devices, 
and iMessage text messaging, and there are many popular apps to encrypt commu-
nications among digital devices. Private browsing is another privacy tool available 
in most browsers that disables browsing history and cookies. This can be useful for 
protecting a consumer’s computer in a shared environment where several users have 
access to the same computer. Browsing history is still retained on the web server. 
Some technologies address the security aspects of privacy, especially the threat of 
man-in-the-middle attacks. Specialized browsers like Epic and Ice Dragon encrypt 
users’ browsing and other data entirely, even at the server level. A very common 
security protocol is HTTPS, which encrypts the messages between a computer and 
the computer server and verifies that users are communicating with an authentic 
website and not an imposter site. 

None of these technological solutions address the core issues of consumer privacy, 
which have to do with what information is being collected, how it is being used, and 
what rights consumers have vis-à-vis their personal information. 
PRIVACY PROTECTION AS A BUSINESS
As websites become more invasive and aggressive in their use of personal informa-
tion, and as public concern grows, a small number of firms have sprung up to sell 
products that they claim will help people protect their privacy. Venture capital firms 
have picked up the scent and are investing in small start-up companies based on the 
premise that people will pay to protect their reputations. For instance, Reputation.com 
has received over $67 million in funding as of 2015. For as little as $14.95 a month, 
you can monitor what people are saying about you, or about your children, on social 
websites. However, these types of firms can succeed only if people are willing to pay 
out of pocket for privacy protection. Economists studying this issue have found that 
people are not willing to pay much to protect their privacy (at most about $30), and

many are willing to give up their privacy for small discounts of a few dollars (Brustein, 
2012; Acquisti et al., 2009). For these reasons the privacy protection business at the 
retail level has not been successful.
PRIVACY ADVOCACY GROUPS
There are a number of privacy advocacy groups that monitor developments in privacy. 
Some of these sites are industry-supported, while others rely on private foundations 
and contributions. Some of the better-known sites are listed in Table 8.11.
LIMITATIONS ON THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY: LAW ENFORCEMENT AND 
SURVEILLANCE 
We’ve emphasized that privacy in the public sector, freedom from government restric-
tions and searches, is very different from privacy in the private, consumer market sector. 
But increasingly these different realms of personal information are coming together. 
Today, the online and mobile behavior, profiles, and transactions of consumers 
are routinely available to a wide range of government agencies and law enforcement 
authorities, contributing to rising fears among online consumers, and in some cases, 
their withdrawal from the online marketplace. The last few years have not been good 
for advocates of privacy, with revelations that federal government agencies have been 
routinely gathering cell phone call data on Americans and foreigners in the United 
States for a period of several years with scant judicial oversight. In 2013, Edward 
Snowden, a security contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), began releas-
ing NSA documents to The Guardian, a U.K. newspaper, providing a detailed descrip-
tion of NSA surveillance programs of both U.S. and foreign citizens. These programs 
were unprecedented in scope and involved wholesale collection of cell phone metadata 
around the world, tapping communications lines of Google, Yahoo, and other Internet 
services, and tapping cell phones of foreign leaders. The NSA enlisted the support of 
the major telecommunications carriers to give it information about Americans’ phone 
calls and e-mail in a program called Prism. These programs were conceived in the 
aftermath of the terrorist attack on the United States on September 11, 2001, and were 
envisaged as necessary to protect the country. The programs were authorized by the

USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and subsequent amendments, and were reviewed by rel-
evant Congressional committees. Many in the computer science academic community 
were aware of these programs, in part because they participated in the development 
of techniques for discovering patterns in large data sets, as well as so-called machine 
learning programs. Nevertheless, the revelations alarmed average citizens who previ-
ously believed that if they did nothing wrong, surely the government would not be 
collecting information about them. The revelations also heightened public aware-
ness and criticism of Internet firms like Google and Facebook, and others engaging 
in extensive tracking and consumer surveillance. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and 
others have since tried to resist or prevent warrantless government access to their 
consumer data (Apuzzo et al., 2015). 
Advances in technology for storing, processing, and analyzing unimaginable quan-
tities of personal data, referred to as big data and business analytics (data mining and 
representation software), have further heightened perceptions that privacy is increas-
ingly difficult to define and protect in the age of e-commerce and social networks 
(Kakutani, 2013; Mayer-Schonberger and Cukier, 2013). 
Striking a balance between security and liberty is at the center of the privacy 
debate (Ford, 2013). While the Internet used to be thought of as impossible for gov-
ernments to control or monitor, nothing could be actually further from the truth. 
Law enforcement authorities have long claimed the right under numerous statutes 
to monitor any form of electronic communication pursuant to a court order and judi-
cial review and based on the reasonable belief that a crime is being committed. This 
includes the surveillance of consumers engaged in e-commerce. The Communications 
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), the USA PATRIOT Act, the Cyber Secu-
rity Enhancement Act, and the Homeland Security Act all strengthen the ability of law 
enforcement agencies to monitor Internet users without their knowledge and, under 
certain circumstances when life is purportedly at stake, without judicial oversight. 
The USA PATRIOT Act, designed to combat terrorism inside the borders of the United 
States, permitted nearly unlimited government surveillance without court oversight, 
according to several senators (Savage, 2012). However, in general, requests to conduct 
surveillance by government agencies require the approval of a Federal Intelligence 
Surveillance Court (FISA court). In 2015, several provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act 
expired. In response, Congress passed the USA Freedom Act, which imposes some 
limits on the bulk collection by the National Security Agency and other U.S. intelli-
gence agencies of U.S. citizens’ telecommunications metadata, but continues to allow 
surveillance of individuals pursuant to a FISA court order. 
There are many Congressional privacy initiatives including the Email Privacy 
Act, which regulates email providers; the Preserving American Privacy Act, which 
regulates the collection of information by drones; and the Online Communications 
and Geolocation Protection Act, which regulates the uses of personal geo-location 
data. However, at this time, it is not likely that any of these proposed bills will be 
enacted by Congress. 
Taking matters into its own hands, in 2014, Apple introduced the iPhone 6, which 
offers the ability to encrypt e-mail, photos, and contacts stored on the phone using 
a strong end-to-end encryption algorithm (E2EE) designed to prevent third parties 
from reading the messages while in transit. Apple also encrypted data stored on the

physical iPhone device. The device data can only be decrypted by using a passcode 
that only the user possesses, and Apple does not retain the key to the code. As a 
result, the NSA potentially could not force Apple or Google to reveal such user data. 
In September 2015, Apple said it could not comply with a court order to turn over text 
messages in real time involving an investigation of drug and gun runners (Apuzzo et 
al., 2015). Not surprisingly, the NSA, FBI, and other law enforcement officials are not 
happy with this prospect and fear that it will enable criminals and terrorists to evade 
surveillance. Apple and Google contend that in order for them to compete globally, 
they must be able to convince consumers that their data is secure, a task made more 
difficult as a result of the Snowden revelations (Sanger and Chen, 2014). In March 
2016, the FBI announced it had cracked the iPhone device encryption without Apple’s 
support, and in April 2016, said it would be helping local law enforcement agencies 
decrypt smartphone and other devices using encryption. With sufficient computing 
power, common encryption methods can be cracked. Read the Insight on Technology 
case: Apple: Defender of Privacy? for a further discussion of this issue. 
Government agencies are among the largest users of private sector commercial 
data brokers, such as Acxiom, Experian, and TransUnion Corporation, that collect a 
vast amount of information about consumers from various offline and online public 
sources, such as public records and the telephone directory, and non-public sources, 
such as “credit header” information from credit bureaus (which typically contains 
name, aliases, birth date, social security number, current and prior addresses, and 
phone numbers). Acxiom is the largest private personal database in the world with 
records on more than 500,000 people and about 1,500 data points per person (Singer, 
2012). Information contained in individual reference services’ databases ranges from 
purely identifying information (e.g., name and phone number) to much more exten-
sive data (e.g., driving records, criminal and civil court records, property records, and 
licensing records). This information can be linked to online behavior information col-
lected from other commercial sources to compile an extensive profile of an individual’s 
online and offline behavior.

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
APPLE: DEFENDER OF PRIVACY?
It’s rare, in fact unprecedented, that 
an Internet giant would take a public 
stand to support the privacy of indi-
viduals from government surveillance, 
and then back it up by making it impos-
sible for law enforcement agencies hunting 
criminals and terrorists to gain access to the per-
sonal information of these persons. But that’s the 
position that Apple and its CEO, Tim Cook, have 
taken with respect to iPhones, and potentially all 
the cloud data Apple stores on its users. Equally 
unprecedented is the support being given to Apple 
by giant players Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and 
others whose very business models are based on 
the largely unregulated collection of personal 
information that is sold to advertisers. 
On December 3, 2015, two terrorists attacked 
fellow county employees in San Bernardino, killing 
fourteen people. The two were ultimately killed in 
a gun battle with police. The terrorists used an 
Apple iPhone 5c in their planning and an operat-
ing system that encrypts the contents of a locked 
iPhone 5c and later model iPhones. If the iPhone 
is unlocked by the user entering the 4-digit pass 
code, then authorities would have access to the 
data. The FBI requested Apple to unlock the 
encryption so it could examine the phone for pos-
sible evidence. Apple refused, claiming it discards 
the unlock keys to its new encrypted phones. 
Only the owner or user of the phone can access 
the phone’s data using their 4-digit pass code 
to unlock the phone. In this case, the owner was 
deceased and his pass code unknown. The oper-
ating system was built so that after ten tries at 
unlocking the phone, the data is permanently 
encrypted. The only other possibility would be for 
Apple to update the iPhone with a new operating 
system that would enable it to bypass the auto 
erase function and access the data. Apple refused 
to do this, even though it would work, because it 
had not built such an operating system and did not 
have the computer code. Apple claimed computer 
code is like speech, and forcing a person or firm to 
write code was a violation of the First Amendment 
guarantees of freedom of speech. 
In the past, Apple has provided information 
from its cloud storage service, which has so far 
remained unencrypted, to federal and state law 
enforcement officials pursuant to a court order. 
But in this instance it claimed breaking the 
encryption on the terrorist’s cellphone would set 
a precedent that would threaten everyone’s civil 
liberties. 
The FBI filed a law suit against Apple 
demanding Apple provide the assistance needed 
to access the phone. Using the All Writs Act of 
1789, the FBI argued it had a court order requir-
ing Apple to provide assistance. In February 2016, 
a federal court agreed with the FBI, and ordered 
Apple to provide the FBI reasonable assistance 
to bypass the auto-erase function of phone. Apple 
appealed, but just prior to the hearing, the FBI 
said it had found a third party who could open the 
iPhone. The appeal hearing was delayed, and the 
question has not been decided. But going forward, 
it is clear that Apple and the government will clash 
again over the right of government investigators to 
access encrypted iPhone and Apple cloud informa-
tion in pursuit of a lawful investigation. 
In an unrelated case, a New York federal mag-
istrate ruled that the All Writs Act could not be 
used to force Apple to unlock an iPhone in a drug 
investigation, or more generally, to force technol-
ogy companies to provide access to law enforce-
ment agencies to their products. In New York City, 
police officials say they have hundreds of iPhones 
used by criminals that cannot be unlocked. In 
an earlier 1977 Supreme Court case, the court 
determined that the All Writs Act could be used 
to compel the New York Telephone Company to

install a device on a rotary phone to track 
the dial numbers of criminals. The CALEA Act 
(Communications Assistance for Law Enforce-
ment Act, 1994), and other legislation passed in 
the post–9-11 era contain provisions requiring 
telecommunications carriers (such as Verizon and 
AT&T) to design and build their systems in such 
a way that law enforcement can gain access to 
communications of suspected criminals and ter-
rorists. CALEA has been extended to include VOiP 
and Internet broadband traffic, but is limited, for 
now, to telecommunications carriers, and does 
not apply to manufacturers of digital devices like 
iPhones, or their operating systems, like Android 
and iOS. This is not new on the American scene: 
government tapping into communications among 
criminals and terrorists was initiated by Abraham 
Lincoln during the Civil War in 1862. Tapping tele-
graph wires was one way to combat the secession-
ist Confederacy. Whether electrical, electronic, or 
digital, the federal government has always claimed 
the right to monitor and record private conversa-
tions pursuant to court orders and a legitimate 
law enforcement action. 
Throughout the controversy Tim Cook, 
Apple’s CEO, has maintained that unlocking its 
iPhones would unleash a torrent of requests from 
governments around the world, including China 
and other totalitarian regimes, seeking access to 
the phones of their citizens. Millions of iPhone 
users, some in totalitarian countries, would be 
susceptible to government hacking of all their 
personal information, messages, and transactions. 
In addition, Cook claimed that without encryp-
tion of iPhone handset data, hackers would be 
able to capture all the personal information of 
its customers, exposing them to additional risk of 
financial, or even personal harm. Hackers would 
know, for instance, when and where consumers 
travelled, their schedules, health data, appoint-
ments, and contacts. These dangers, Cook claimed, 
weighed more heavily than dangers brought about 
by terrorists using iPhones to communicate with 
impunity. 
Cook maintains that Apple has an obligation 
to protect its customers’ data and privacy, and 
calls for a national debate over the privacy of per-
sonal data and how much power the government 
should have over personal information. 
This is not the first time that Tim Cook has 
taken Apple in the direction of strong privacy pro-
tection. In June 2015, Cook gave a most unusual 
speech for a Silicon Valley executive. Cook attacked 
other Internet giants like Google, Facebook, Yahoo, 
and Microsoft for invading their customers’ privacy. 
Apple, he said, rejected the idea that customers 
have to make a trade-off between privacy and secu-
rity. Cook believes people have a fundamental right 
to privacy. Some of the most prominent firms in 
Silicon Valley, Cook argued, lull their customers 
into giving up a treasure of personal information 
in order to receive some service, like cloud storage, 
social networking, or photo services for “free.” In 
fact, Cook argued, the trade-off comes at a high 
cost to the consumer in the form of the loss of 
privacy and fear about what might become of their 
personal information. In the end, he said, consum-
ers will regret the trade. These companies, he noted, 
are gobbling up everything they can learn about 
consumers and trying to monetize it by selling it 
to advertisers. Cook’s strong statements on the 
importance of privacy are contrary to the views of 
Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook, 
most famously summarized in his January 2011 
interview arguing that the age of privacy is over 
(see the Chapter 1 Insight on Society case, Face-
book and the Age of Privacy). Google, in turn, has 
built its many apps from search to Google Docs to 
Gmail on the premise that monitoring the behav-
ior and writing of its users on all platforms, then 
integrating the data and selling it to advertisers 
is a successful business model that improves the 
customer experience. 
Critics point to the many ironies in Apple’s 
position. Apple’s iPhone platform provides the 
technical platform for the massive invasion of 
privacy resulting from Google’s mobile search 
engine and Facebook’s mobile social network. 

	
I n t e l l e c t u a l  P r o p e r t y  R i g h t s 	

533
Both of these firms derive from a very significant 
portion of their ad revenue from mobile advertis-
ing targeted to individuals based on their personal 
information. If Google and Facebook could not 
show ads on the iPhone platform, they would not 
provide their services, and instead remain available 
solely on the Web. This would reduce the value of 
the iPhone platform and lead to reduced sales of 
the devices. This kind of commercial privacy inva-
sion may annoy Cook, but Apple allows it go on 
because it helps sell iPhones. In addition, millions 
of apps on iOS devices gather data on users, and 
sell the information to marketers. If commercial 
invasion of privacy was not allowed, then who 
would build apps for the iPhone platform? Other 
critics point to Cook’s claim that allowing the 
government to access the iPhones of criminals, 
even with a court order, would endanger millions 
of iPhone users around the world by encouraging 
governments to monitor their citizens’ communica-
tions. Worse, if Apple was forced to build a back 
door, it would inevitably be discovered by hackers, 
posing further risks for customers. 
Are these real risks? Possibly. But there is also 
the risk that should the iPhone become the pre-
ferred and protected communication tool for crimi-
nals and terrorists, beyond government surveillance 
and monitoring, millions of Apple customers, not 
to mention millions of others, would become more 
vulnerable to criminals and terrorist attacks. 
But Cook, along with the other Internet titans, 
may be looking towards the future. Tomorrow’s 
smartphone will be quite different from 
today’s. New technologies such as proactive 
assistants will be gathering your personal infor-
mation, and predictive analytics will be coming 
up with suggestions for your car trips, your exer-
cise routine, and your appointments without your 
prompting. The amount of personal information 
that smartphone users commit to their handsets, 
and cloud backup servers, is likely to grow expo-
nentially in the next five years. This incredibly con-
venient device will contain nearly all the personal 
private information that customers generate in the 
course of their life and travels. 
Most observers believe the dispute will 
ultimately go before the Supreme Court, which 
will have to balance the interests of government 
gaining access to private information for law 
enforcement purposes, the interests of consumers 
to privacy, and the interests of firms like Apple 
and Google, whose business model is based on 
consumers committing more and more of their 
personal information to digital devices. Congress 
will weigh in as well, trying to establish law in a 
world of new digital devices where the old laws 
governing telecommunication carriers may not be 
applicable, or may need extension to cover not just 
phone systems, but all digital devices that connect 
to the Internet. Shareholders may also have a say 
in the outcome of the coming debate. Making a 
product that is a protected communications device 
for terrorists and criminals may not be a promis-
ing marketing plan.

the United States, the creator of intellectual property owns it. For instance, if you per-
sonally create an e-commerce site, it belongs entirely to you, and you have exclusive 
rights to use this “property” in any lawful way you see fit. But the Internet potentially 
changes things. Once intellectual works become digital, it becomes difficult to control 
access, use, distribution, and copying. These are precisely the areas that intellectual 
property seeks to control.
Digital media differ from books, periodicals, and other media in terms of ease of 
replication, transmission, and alteration; difficulty in classifying a software work as 
a program, book, or even music; compactness—making theft easy; and difficulty in 
establishing uniqueness. Before widespread use of the Internet, copies of software, 
books, magazine articles, or films had to be stored on physical media, such as paper, 
computer disks, or videotape, creating hurdles to distribution, and raising the costs 
of illegal copies.
The Internet technically permits millions of people to make perfect digital copies 
of various works—from music to plays, poems, and journal articles—and then to dis-
tribute them nearly cost-free to hundreds of millions of online users. The proliferation 
of innovation has occurred so rapidly that few entrepreneurs have stopped to con-
sider who owns the patent on a business technique or method that they are using on 
their site. The spirit of the Web has been so free-wheeling that many entrepreneurs 
ignored trademark law and registered domain names that could easily be confused 
with another company’s registered trademarks. In short, the Internet has demon-
strated the potential to disrupt traditional conceptions and implementations of intel-
lectual property law developed over the last two centuries.
The major ethical issue related to e-commerce and intellectual property concerns 
how we (both as individuals and as business professionals) should treat property that 
belongs to others. From a social point of view, the main questions are: Is there con-
tinued value in protecting intellectual property in the Internet age? In what ways is 
society better off, or worse off, for having the concept of property apply to intangible 
ideas, including music, books, and movies? Should society make certain technology 
illegal or restrict the use of the Internet just because it has an adverse impact on some 
intellectual property owners? From a political perspective, we need to ask how the 
Internet and e-commerce can be regulated or governed to protect the institution of 
intellectual property while at the same time encouraging the growth of e-commerce 
and the Internet.
TYPES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION
There are three main types of intellectual property protection: copyright, patent, and 
trademark law. In the United States, the development of intellectual property law 
begins with the U.S. Constitution, which mandated Congress to devise a system of 
laws to promote “the progress of science and the useful arts.” Congress passed the first 
copyright law in 1790 to protect original written works for a period of 14 years, with a 
14-year renewal if the author was still alive. Since then, the idea of copyright has been 
extended to include music, films, translations, photographs, and most recently the 
designs of vessels under 200 feet (Fisher, 1999). The copyright law has been amended 
(mostly extended) 11 times in the last 40 years.

The goal of intellectual property law is to balance two competing interests—the 
public and the private. The public interest is served by the creation and distribution of 
inventions, works of art, music, literature, and other forms of intellectual expression. 
The private interest is served by rewarding people for creating these works through 
the creation of a time-limited monopoly granting exclusive use to the creator.
Maintaining this balance of interests is always challenged by the invention of new 
technologies. In general, the information technologies of the last century—from radio 
and television to CD-ROMs, DVDs, and the Internet—have at first tended to weaken 
the protections afforded by intellectual property law. Owners of intellectual property 
have often, but not always, been successful in pressuring Congress and the courts to 
strengthen the intellectual property laws to compensate for any technological threat, 
and even to extend protection for longer periods of time and to entirely new areas of 
expression. In the case of the Internet and e-commerce technologies, once again, intel-
lectual property rights are severely challenged. In the next few sections, we discuss 
the significant developments in each area: copyright, patent, and trademark.
COPYRIGHT: THE PROBLEM OF PERFECT COPIES AND ENCRYPTION
In the United States, copyright law protects original forms of expression such as 
writings (books, periodicals, lecture notes), art, drawings, photographs, music, motion 
pictures, performances, and computer programs from being copied by others for a 
period of time. Up until 1998, the copyright law protected works of individuals for 
their lifetime plus 50 years beyond their life, and works created for hire and owned 
by corporations, such as Mickey Mouse of the Disney Corporation, for 75 years after 
initial creation. Copyright does not protect ideas—just their expression in a tangible 
medium such as paper, cassette tape, or handwritten notes.
In 1998, Congress extended the period of copyright protection for an additional 
20 years, for a total of 95 years for corporate-owned works, and life plus 70 years of 
protection for works created by individuals (the Copyright Term Extension Act, also 
known as the CTEA). In Eldred v. Ashcroft, the Supreme Court ruled that the CTEA was 
constitutional, over the objections of groups arguing that Congress had given copyright 
holders a permanent monopoly over the expression of ideas, which ultimately would 
work to inhibit the flow of ideas and creation of new works by making existing works 
too expensive (Eldred v. Ashcroft, 2003; Greenhouse, 2003a). Librarians, academics, 
and others who depend on inexpensive access to copyrighted material opposed the 
legislation.
In the mid-1960s, the Copyright Office began registering software programs, and 
in 1980, Congress passed the Computer Software Copyright Act, which clearly provides 
protection for source and object code and for copies of the original sold in commerce, 
and sets forth the rights of the purchaser to use the software while the creator retains 
legal title. For instance, the HTML code for a web page—even though easily available 
to every browser—cannot be lawfully copied and used for a commercial purpose, say, 
to create a new website that looks identical.
Copyright protection is clear-cut: it protects against copying of entire programs or 
their parts. Damages and relief are readily obtained for infringement. The drawback to 
copyright protection is that the underlying ideas behind a work are not protected, only 
copyright law
protects original forms of 
expression such as writ-
ings, art, drawings, photo-
graphs, music, motion 
pictures, performances, and 
computer programs from 
being copied by others for 
a minimum of 70 years

their expression in a work. A competitor can view the source code on your website 
to see how various effects were created and then reuse those techniques to create a 
different website without infringing on your copyright.
Look and Feel
“Look and feel” copyright infringement lawsuits are precisely about the distinction 
between an idea and its expression. For instance, in 1988, Apple Computer sued 
Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Inc. for infringing Apple’s copyright on the 
Macintosh interface. Among other claims, Apple claimed that the defendants copied 
the expression of overlapping windows. Apple failed to patent the idea of overlapping 
windows when it invented this method of presenting information on a computer 
screen in the late 1960s. The defendants counterclaimed that the idea of overlapping 
windows could only be expressed in a single way and, therefore, was not protectable 
under the “merger” doctrine of copyright law. When ideas and their expression merge 
(i.e., if there is only one way to express an idea), the expression cannot be copyrighted, 
although the method of producing the expression might be patentable (Apple Com-
puter, Inc. v. Microsoft, 1989). In general, courts appear to be following the reasoning 
of a 1992 case—Brown Bag Software vs. Symantec Corp.—in which the court dissected 
the elements of software alleged to be infringing. There, the Federal Circuit Court 
of Appeals found that neither similar concept, function, general functional features 
(e.g., drop-down menus), nor colors were protectable by copyright law (Brown Bag vs. 
Symantec Corp., 1992).
Fair Use Doctrine
Copyrights, like all rights, are not absolute. There are situations where strict copyright 
observance could be harmful to society, potentially inhibiting other rights such as the 
right to freedom of expression and thought. As a result, the doctrine of fair use has 
been created. The doctrine of fair use permits teachers, writers, and others to use 
copyrighted materials without permission under certain circumstances. Table 8.12 
describes the five factors that courts consider when assessing what constitutes fair 
use.
The fair use doctrine draws upon the First Amendment’s protection of freedom 
of speech (and writing). Journalists, writers, and academics must be able to refer to, 
and cite from, copyrighted works in order to criticize, or even discuss them. Professors 
are allowed to clip a contemporary article just before class, copy it, and hand it out to 
students as an example of a topic under discussion. However, they are not permitted 
to add this article to the class syllabus for the next semester without compensating 
the copyright holder.
What constitutes fair use has been at issue in a number of recent cases. In Kelly 
v. Arriba Soft (2003) and Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc. et al., (2007), the Federal 
Circuit Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit held that the display of thumbnail images 
in response to search requests constituted fair use. A similar result was reached by the 
district court for the District of Nevada with respect to Google’s storage and display of 
websites from cache memory, in Field v. Google, Inc. (2006). In all of these cases, the 
courts accepted the argument that caching the material and displaying it in response 
doctrine of fair use
under certain circum-
stances, permits use of 
copyrighted material 
without permission

to a search request was not only a public benefit, but also a form of marketing of the 
material on behalf of its copyright owner, thereby enhancing the material’s commercial 
value. In what’s known as the “dancing baby case,” a mother uploaded a 30-second 
video to YouTube of her baby dancing to a song by Prince called Let’s Go Crazy. Uni-
versal Music Group, the owner of the copyright to the song, objected and issued a 
DMCA takedown notice to YouTube. The mother sued, claiming that Universal failed 
to consider whether use of the song in the video was fair use before issuing the take-
down notice. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals  agreed that a copyright owner must 
consider fair use before sending a takedown notice. The ruling has been appealed to 
the Supreme Court (Morran, 2016; Bergen, 2015). 
Fair use was also at issue in a lawsuit filed by the Authors Guild and five major 
publishing companies against Google. In 2004, Google announced a book project with 
two parts. A Partner Program would scan books with the permission of publishers, 
index the books, post snippets of the books on line, and make bibliographic informa-
tion available on Google’s search engine. In the second project, called the Library 
Project, Google aimed to scan all the books in several university and public libraries, 
and then make snippets and parts of the book available online without receiving per-
mission from the publishers or paying royalties. Google said it would never show a 
full page, just relevant portions of a page in response to searches. In 2005, the Authors 
Guild and the large book publishers filed a lawsuit seeking to prevent Google from 
implementing the Library Project. 
Google argued that the Library Project constituted fair use of publishers’ copy-
righted works because it only published snippets. Moreover, Google claimed that it was 
simply helping libraries do what they are intended to do, namely, lend books. Library 
lending is considered a fair use following an agreement in the late 1930s with publish-
ers, and such lending was codified into the Copyright Act of 1976. Google claimed that 
helping libraries make books more available to the public was in the broader public 
interest, and extended existing rights of libraries to encourage book availability.

In 2013, eight years later, a federal court finally found in favor of Google without 
reservation by ruling that Google’s scanning and making snippets of text available to 
the public was “fair use” under U.S. copyright law. The judge believed the project had 
a broad public purpose of making it easier for students, researchers, teachers, and 
the general public to find books, while also preserving consideration for author and 
publisher rights. The Google project was “transformative” in the court’s view, giving 
books a new character and purpose, making it easier to discover old books, and leading 
to increased sales. After a decade of litigation, the Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that 
Google’s Library Project was fair use, and the matter is settled from a legal perspective 
(Liptak and Alter, 2016). In the meantime, the project itself has stalled, and efforts to 
scan so-called orphan books in libraries where the copyright holder could not be identi-
fied have ended. Google now appears less than enthusiastic about pursuing the project, 
in part, analysts believe, because the project offered no hope of ever making a return 
on the investment, and created a rift with the author and publishing community.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998 was the first major effort 
to adjust the copyright laws of the United States to the Internet age, and remains to 
this day, the primary statute that defines the relationship between copyright owners, 
Internet service providers (which in this context also includes website publishers as 
well as firms that provide Internet service), and end-users of copyrighted material. 
The law implements two international treaties of the World Intellectual Property 
Organization (WIPO), a worldwide body formed by the major nations in North America 
and Europe, as well as Japan. This is one case where law preceded or at least was 
contemporaneous with digital technology. Table 8.13 summarizes the major provi-
sions of the DMCA. 
There are a number of different actors and conflicting interests involved in the 
process of delivering content on the Internet. Obviously, copyright owners do not want 
their work copied and distributed without their consent (and probably compensation), 
and they do not want their digital rights management software programs broken, 
compromised, or made ineffectual. ISPs want the freedom to use content within the 
provisions of “fair use” and do not want to be held liable for content that users may 
post to their websites. ISPs argue that they are similar to telephone transmission lines, 
merely providing a method of communication, and they should not be required to 
monitor their users’ activities to see if they are posting copyrighted material. Such sur-
veillance, ISPs and civil libertarians argue, would constitute a restriction on freedom 
of expression. In addition, the economics of the Internet could be compromised if ISPs 
were unnecessarily restricted and pay the costs of vetting all content posted by users. 
The business model of many Internet firms depends on creating large, even huge, 
audiences, and the more content that can be displayed, the larger the audience, and 
the more ads can be sold. ISPs also generate revenue from selling bandwidth, so the 
greater the bandwidth required to support large audiences, the better it is for them. 
Restricting content is bad for business. Finally, consumers of Internet content want as 
much content as possible, at the lowest cost possible, or even free. The more content 
for users to consume, the more they benefit from the Internet.

The DMCA tries to balance these different interests. Title I of the DMCA imple-
ments the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, which makes it illegal to make, distribute, 
or use devices that circumvent technology-based protections of copyrighted materials, 
and attaches stiff fines and prison sentences for violations. This makes it illegal, for 
instance, to break the security software typically found on DVDs, Amazon’s Kindle 
books, and similar devices. There are a number of exceptions to the strong prohibitions 
against defeating a copyright protection scheme, however, including exceptions for 
libraries to examine works for adoption, for reverse engineering to achieve interopera-
bility with other software, for encryption research, and for privacy protection purposes.
Title II of the DMCA creates two safe harbors for ISPs. The first safe harbor (the 
Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act) provides that ISPs will not 
be held liable for infringing material that users post to blogs, web pages, or forums, as 
long as the ISP did not have knowledge that the content was infringing, did not receive 
any financial benefit attributable to the infringing activity (assuming they can control 
this activity), and acts expeditiously to remove infringing content when notified by 
a notice of infringement. This means that users of, say, YouTube, can post material 
that infringes a copyright and YouTube cannot be held liable (safe harbor) as long as 
it does not know the material is infringing, and if it demonstrates that it has in place 
procedures to take down infringing content once it becomes aware of the matter or 
receives a proper notice from the copyright owner. Such a notice is called a takedown

notice, a claim by the copyright owner that the ISP is hosting infringing content. Copy-
right owners can also subpoena the personal identities of any infringers using an ISP. 
The second safe harbor relates to links to infringing material: ISPs will not be 
held liable for referring or linking users to a site that contains infringing material or 
infringing activity. So for example, a search engine that directs users to a website that 
contains pirated songs or movies cannot be held liable. This safe harbor is applicable 
as long as ISPs did not have knowledge they were linking users to sites containing 
infringing content, did not receive any financial benefit attributable to the infringing 
activity (assuming they can control this activity), and acts expeditiously to remove or 
disable any such link after receiving a proper notice from the copyright owner. 
There are a number of administrative requirements for ISPs to be protected by 
the safe harbor provisions. ISPs must designate an agent to receive takedown notices; 
adopt and publish a copyright infringement policy (this can be part of a terms of use 
policy); and comply with takedown notices by removing the content, and/or links to 
the content. The penalties for willfully violating the DMCA include restitution to the 
injured parties of any losses due to infringement. Criminal remedies may include fines 
up to $500,000 or five years imprisonment for a first offense, and up to $1 million in 
fines and 10 years in prison for repeat offenders. These are serious penalties, but they 
have rarely been imposed. 
The DMCA relieves ISPs of any liability for posting or linking to copyrighted mate-
rial, if they can meet the safe harbors’ conditions. This means users of YouTube can 
post what they want, and YouTube will not be held liable for infringing content even if 
it violates YouTube’s terms of use policy, which states that users shall not post infring-
ing content. However, it does require YouTube to remove content or links that are 
infringing once it receives a valid takedown notice. With respect to receiving financial 
benefits, ISPs may indeed receive financial benefits from posting infringing content 
if they can show that they can’t control the behavior of their users, or that there is no 
way of knowing prior to the posting that the material is infringing. For instance, how 
can YouTube be held responsible for users who post copyrighted songs or movies? How 
could YouTube know, at the time of posting, that the content is infringing?
ISPs and individuals who post content are also protected from frivolous takedown 
notices. For instance, the ruling in the “dancing baby” case discussed on page 535 put 
copyright owners on notice that they needed to be careful issuing takedown notices 
if use of the copyrighted material might constitute fair use and that the DMCA does 
not supersede the doctrine of fair use. 
Safe harbor provisions of the DMCA were also at the heart of a $1 billion lawsuit 
originally brought by Viacom in 2007 against Google and YouTube for willful copyright 
infringement. In the Viacom case, Viacom alleged that YouTube and Google engaged 
in massive copyright infringement by deliberately and knowingly building up a library 
of infringing works to draw traffic to the YouTube site and enhance its commercial 
value. Entire episodes of shows like SpongeBob SquarePants and The Daily Show 
were appearing on YouTube without permission or payment. In response, Google and 
YouTube claimed that they are protected by the DMCA’s safe harbor provisions and 
that it is impossible to know whether a video is infringing or not. YouTube also does

not display ads on pages where consumers can view videos unless it has an agreement 
with the content owner. In 2007, Google announced a filtering system (Content ID) 
aimed at addressing the problem. It requires content owners to give Google a copy 
of their content so Google can load it into an auto-identification system. Then after 
a video is uploaded to YouTube, the system attempts to match it with its database of 
copyrighted material and removes any unauthorized material. The copyright owner 
has several options: it can mute the audio; block a whole video; monetize the video 
by running ads against it; and track the video’s viewer statistics. In 2014, seven years 
after the billion dollar suit was filed, and multiple court room appearances, Google 
and Viacom settled out of court. Google’s ability to take down copyrighted material 
using Content ID had become very effective, and Google agreed to rent hundreds of 
Viacom shows (Kaufman, 2014). Both parties recognized in a joint statement that they 
could achieve their objectives by collaborating rather than continuing the lawsuit. 
The entertainment industry continues to be aggressive in pursuing online copy-
right infringement. In 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice seized the domain Megaup-
load.com, one of the largest cyberlockers on the Internet dedicated to storing and 
sharing copyrighted movies and music. A cyberlocker is an online file storage service 
dedicated to sharing copyrighted material (often movies) illegally. Megaupload’s 
founder, Kim Dotcom, was arrested in New Zealand at his home, and $17 million in 
assets, and later, $37 million in cash in Hong Kong, was confiscated. Mr. Dotcom is 
currently back in court, and fighting efforts by the United States to extradite him from 
New Zealand to face copyright, racketeering, and money laundering charges (Reuters, 
2015). In 2016, the U.S. federal government seized Mr. Dotcom’s assets that were 
located in the United States, along with the assets of others associated with him, 
pending his extradition to the United States to face criminal piracy charges.
Since the Megaupload case, other cyberlockers have restricted their activities to 
avoid a similar fate as Megaupload. In 2013, the Center for Copyright Information 
(CCI), along with 5 of the largest ISPs, major entertainment industry companies, and 
the Consumer Advisory Board launched the Copyright Alert System (CAS)—a tiered 
notice and response system aimed at reducing copyright infringement over P2P net-
works. During its first 10 months of operation, the CAS sent out over 1.3 million alerts 
to 720,000 ISP account holders of alleged copyright infringement. If the account holder 
ignores repeated alerts, their ISP may impose consequences, such as a downgrade of 
the customer’s Internet service. The CCI believes that the CAS has great promise for 
its ability to move user behavior away from copyright infringement and toward legal 
sources of content (Center for Copyright Information, 2014). Refer to the chapter-
ending case study on The Pirate Bay.
In 2016, DMCA litigation continues. In BMG Rights Management v. Cox Communica-
tions, a federal judge let stand a $25 million jury award against Cox Cable in favor of 
BMG, a rights management firm, for willful contributory infringement. BMG argued 
that Cox, an ISP, was allowing subscribers to use BitTorrent to upload copyrighted songs 
to various websites without an effective policy for preventing this activity, and failing 
to remove repeat offenders from its service. Cox argued that it was just a pipeline to the 
Internet and could not be held liable for what its users posted or what software they

used. However, although the court left the jury award against Cox in place, it refused 
to enjoin Cox from continuing to operate, as BMG had requested, noting that while 
there is a public benefit to reducing copyright infringement, because Cox provides 
access to the Internet and enables freedom of speech, these interests trumped BMG’s 
interest in copyright protection (Gardner, 2016). 
Also in 2016, a federal court ruled that the video sharing site Vimeo was pro-
tected by DMCA against liability for allowing users to post copyrighted video and 
music created prior to 1972 when DMCA became law. Vimeo did have a procedure of 
accepting infringement notices and taking down infringing content, but some pre-1972 
music tracks were still on the site despite repeated takedown notices (Capital Records 
v. Vimeo LLC, 2016). 
Copyright owners from the film and music industry are lobbying Congress for 
changes in the DMCA that would require websites and ISPs to take more effective 
actions in removing infringing content (Raymond, 2016). Musicians and film makers 
have begun to protest the compensation they receive from streaming services (see 
Chapter 10). 
While there has been some progress in limiting infringing content on the Internet, 
new mobile apps such as Periscope and Meerkat make it easy for people to capture 
live video and stream it to these apps on mobile devices, making it extremely difficult 
for content owners to protect the value of their live products. Periscope is owned by 
Twitter and users can post live videos to Twitter. Meerkat can post live video streams 
to most social network sites, including Facebook. In 2015, Periscope and Meerkat were 
used by thousands of users to watch the pay-per-view broadcast of the welterweight 
fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao for free. The pay-per-view 
price on cable networks was $100. Other users have streamed live TV series such as 
HBO’s Game of Thrones. Periscope received 1,400 DMCA takedown requests in the 
first three months of its existence. Twitter says it has complied with 71% of these 
(Weber, 2015). But the DMCA takedown notices do not help a unique live event such 
as a championship boxing match retain its value. The value of the event is largely in 
attracting viewers willing to pay to see it as it happens, and once a free alternative is 
available, that value is diminished. 
PATENTS: BUSINESS METHODS AND PROCESSES
“Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, 
machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and 
useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefore, 
subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.”
—Section 101, U.S. Patent Act
A patent grants the owner a 20-year exclusive monopoly on the ideas behind an inven-
tion. The congressional intent behind patent law was to ensure that inventors of new 
machines, devices, or industrial methods would receive the full financial and other 
rewards of their labor and still make widespread use of the invention possible by

sive monopoly on the ideas

providing detailed diagrams for those wishing to use the idea under license from the 
patent’s owner. Patents are obtained from the United States Patent and Trademark 
Office (USPTO), which was created in 1812. Obtaining a patent is much more difficult 
and time-consuming than obtaining copyright protection (which is automatic with the 
creation of the work). Patents must be formally applied for, and the granting of a patent 
is determined by Patent Office examiners who follow a set of rigorous rules. Ulti-
mately, federal courts decide when patents are valid and when infringement occurs.
Patents are very different from copyrights because patents protect the ideas them-
selves and not merely the expression of ideas. There are four types of inventions for 
which patents are granted under patent law: machines, man-made products, com-
positions of matter, and processing methods. The Supreme Court has determined 
that patents extend to “anything under the sun that is made by man” (Diamond v. 
Chakrabarty, 1980) as long as the other requirements of the Patent Act are met. There 
are three things that cannot be patented: laws of nature, natural phenomena, and 
abstract ideas. For instance, a mathematical algorithm cannot be patented unless it is 
realized in a tangible machine or process that has a “useful” result (the mathematical 
algorithm exception).
In order to be granted a patent, the applicant must show that the invention is 
new, original, novel, nonobvious, and not evident in prior arts and practice. As with 
copyrights, the granting of patents has moved far beyond the original intent of Con-
gress’s first patent statute, which sought to protect industrial designs and machines. 
Patent protection has been extended to articles of manufacture (1842), plants (1930), 
surgical and medical procedures (1950), and software (1981). The Patent Office did 
not accept applications for software patents until a 1981 Supreme Court decision that 
held that computer programs could be a part of a patentable process. Since that time, 
thousands of software patents have been granted. Virtually any software program can 
be patented as long as it is novel and not obvious.
Essentially, as technology and industrial arts progress, patents have been extended 
to both encourage entrepreneurs to invent useful devices and promote widespread 
dissemination of the new techniques through licensing and artful imitation of the 
published patents (the creation of devices that provide the same functionality as the 
invention but use different methods) (Winston, 1998). Patents encourage inventors 
to come up with unique ways of achieving the same functionality as existing patents. 
For instance, Amazon’s patent on one-click purchasing caused Barnesandnoble.com 
to invent a simplified two-click method of purchasing.
The danger of patents is that they stifle competition by raising barriers to entry 
into an industry. Patents force new entrants to pay licensing fees to incumbents, and 
thus slow down the development of technical applications of new ideas by creating 
lengthy licensing applications and delays. Nowhere is the tradeoff between encour-
aging innovation and yet avoiding raising barriers to market entry (and thereby dis-
couraging innovation) more evident than in the patent battle that has raged between 
Apple and Samsung in the smartphone market.
In 2011, Apple filed suit in the United States against Samsung alleging that Sam-
sung’s Galaxy smartphones violated Apple patents on its iPhone and iPad computer. By 
2012, Apple and Samsung were involved in over 50 different patent lawsuits through-

APPLE/SAMSUNG SMARTPHONE PATENT WARS
Y E A R
D E S C R I P T I O N
2011–2012
In 2011 Apple filed suit in the United States charging Samsung devices 
violated Apple patents, and Samsung claimed similar infringement by Apple. 
The smartphone patent wars begin. 
Apple’s patents had been filed in January 2007 shortly after the introduction 
of the iPhone. The design patents covered the basic shape of the phone, 
software features (slide-to-unlock, autocorrect, bounce-back effect, and 
quicklinks), trade dress features, and user interface (home button and icons 
with rounded and tapered edges). In short, everything that made the iPhone 
a unique product. 
By 2012, Apple and Samsung are involved in 50 different lawsuits around the 
world involving the design of tablets and smartphones. 
August 2012
First jury verdict mostly favorable to Apple. Found Samsung had infringed on 
design and utility patents, and Apple’s trade dress features. Awarded Apple 
$1.049 billion. An injunction preventing Samsung from selling infringing 
products was at first denied, but later granted.
November 2013
A retrial of the first jury trial. Samsung admitted to infringing on Apple 
patents, but argued the penalty was too high. The jury reduced the damages 
to $290 million. 
May 2014
Another jury trial. Apple wins jury verdict of $119.6 million against Samsung, 
finding that Samsung infringed on patents for slide-to-unlock, autocorrect, 
and quicklinks features. Judge declines to force removal of devices from 
market, instead argues for damages as penalty. 
September 2015
Apple and Samsung announced an agreement to participate in court-
supervised mediation of their five-year dispute. This is the third effort at 
mediation (the first two failed). 
2016 
Apple asks the Supreme Court to rule that Samsung must pay $548 million to 
Apple for patent infringment based on the value of the entire phone, not just 
its specific design elements which Samsung argues are a small part of the 
phone’s value.
out the world. See Table 8.14 for a brief history of the Apple/Samsung smartphone 
patent wars. 
The history of the patent battle is quite complex, and lengthy, lasting over five 
years. There are three questions raised in this litigation. First, does Apple have valid 
patents on iPhone and iPad hardware and software? Second, did Samsung’s phones 
and tablets infringe on these Apple patents? And third, if Samsung did infringe, what 
should the penalty be? There are two possibilities: Samsung pays a fine for damages 
and/or Samsung removes its infringing products from the market. A fourth question 
is separate from the lawsuits per se and concerns society, the rest of us: what is the 
best outcome for society? 
After five years and two jury trials, the courts have decided that Apple does have 
valid patents on the physical iPhone, as well as the operating system, including the 
physical design (rounded corners and bezel), user interface, and screen functional-
ity. Second, the courts did find that Samsung infringed on some of Apple’s patents, 

	
I n t e l l e c t u a l  P r o p e r t y  R i g h t s 	

545
and even Samsung admits as much. Third, the courts have generally avoided forcing 
Samsung to remove its infringing devices from the market, and instead have focused 
on damages with some exceptions for older phones (Decker, 2015). However, in Sep-
tember 2015, Apple finally won a U.S. appeals court judgment that enjoins Samsung 
from selling smartphones with Apple’s patented slide-to-unlock, autocorrect, and 
quicklinks features. This was a major victory in principle that Apple can use in the 
future against other copycat firms (Chen, 2015; Kendall and Wakabayashi, 2015). But 
Samsung had already designed around these features and came up with its own user 
interface that accomplishes the same tasks. Hence, the ruling is not likely to have a 
notable impact on Samsung’s sales revenues. The original jury award of $1 billion has 
been whittled down over the years. Analysts believe the cost to Apple of this litigation 
is at least equal to the damage award it may ultimately be paid. Over the last five years 
of litigation, Samsung has changed its interface and functionality to greatly reduce its 
infringement. Software features can always be designed around. In 2016, Apple asked 
the Supreme Court to rule that Samsung must pay for its patent infringement based on 
all of the profits it made on the entire phone. Samsung argued it should only be liable 
for that portion of the profits attributable to the design of the phones, a much smaller 
liability (Kendall, 2016). The final chapter may not be closed until 2017.
An answer to the fourth question, what is the best outcome for society, is more 
difficult to determine. Apple’s forceful defense has put copycat firms on notice that 
if they infringe on patents owned by large firms such as Apple, it could be harmful 
to their brands and possibly result in significant damages. Samsung has been pushed 
into the lower end of the market where it competes with less expensive, copycat 
smartphones from China. Samsung has a very large chunk of the smartphone market 
worldwide, but it has been denied pricing power and resulting profits. The litigation 
may have strengthened Apple’s claim that its computers and smartphones are truly 
unique, and original. Apple today is the largest corporation in the United States by 
market capitalization and also the most profitable in the world. Samsung’s copying 
of Apple designs and features may only have strengthened Apple’s claims to be a 
superior product. 
E-commerce Patents
Much of the Internet’s infrastructure and software was developed under the auspices 
of publicly funded scientific and military programs in the United States and Europe. 
Unlike Samuel F. B. Morse, who patented the idea of Morse code and made the tele-
graph useful, most of the inventions that make the Internet and e-commerce possible 
were not patented by their inventors. The early Internet was characterized by a spirit 
of worldwide community development and sharing of ideas without consideration of 
personal wealth (Winston, 1998). This early Internet spirit changed in the mid-1990s 
with the commercial development of the Web.
In 1998, a landmark legal decision, State Street Bank & Trust v. Signature Financial 
Group, Inc., paved the way for business firms to begin applying for “business methods” 
patents. In this case, a Federal Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the claims of Signature 
Financial to a valid patent for a business method that allows managers to monitor and 
record financial information flows generated by a partner fund. Previously, it was

C H A P T E R  8     E t h i c a l ,  S o c i a l ,  a n d  P o l i t i c a l  I s s u e s  i n  E - c o m m e r c e
thought business methods could not be patented. However, the court ruled there was 
no reason to disallow business methods from patent protection, or any “step by step 
process, be it electronic or chemical or mechanical, [that] involves an algorithm in 
the broad sense of the term” (State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, 
1998). The State Street decision led to an explosion in applications for e-commerce 
“business methods” patents. In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a divided opinion 
on business methods patents in the Bilski et al. v. Kappos case (Bilski et al. v. Kappos, 
2010). The majority argued that business methods patents were allowable even though 
they did not meet the traditional “machine or transformation test,” in which patents 
are granted to devices that are tied to a particular machine, are a machine, or trans-
form articles from one state to another. The minority wanted to flatly declare that 
business methods are not patentable in part because any series of steps could be 
considered a business method (Schwartz, 2010). The Supreme Court struck another 
blow against business method patents in 2014, with its decision in Alice Corporation 
vs. CLS Bank International. The Court ruled that basic business methods cannot be 
patented and that while software can be patented, implementing an abstract idea that 
otherwise could not be patented by using software does not transform the idea into 
a patentable innovation (Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank International, 2014).
Table 8.15 lists some of the better-known e-commerce patents. Some are con-
troversial. Reviewing these, you can understand the concerns of commentators and 
corporations. Some of the patent claims are very broad (for example, “name your 
price” sales methods), have historical precedents in the pre-Internet era (shopping 
carts), and seem “obvious” (one-click purchasing). Critics of online business methods 
patents argue that the Patent Office has been too lenient in granting such patents, 
and that in most instances, the supposed inventions merely copy pre-Internet busi-
ness methods and thus do not constitute “inventions” (Harmon, 2003; Thurm, 2000; 
Chiappetta, 2001). The Patent Office argues, on the contrary, that its Internet inven-
tions staff is composed of engineers, lawyers, and specialists with many years of 
experience with Internet and network technologies, and that it consults with outside 
technology experts before granting patents. To complicate matters, the European 
Patent Convention and the patent laws of most European countries do not recognize 
business methods per se unless the method is implemented through some technology 
(Takenaka, 2001).
TRADEMARKS: ONLINE INFRINGEMENT AND DILUTION
A trademark is “any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combi-
nation thereof ... used in commerce ... to identify and distinguish 
... goods ... from those manufactured or sold by others and to 
indicate the source of the goods.”
—The Trademark Act, 1946
Trademark law is a form of intellectual property protection for trademarks—a mark 
used to identify and distinguish goods and indicate their source. Trademark protections 
exist at both the federal and state levels in the United States. The purpose of trademark

SELECTED E-COMMERCE PATENTS
C O M P A N Y
S U B J E C T
U P D A T E
Amazon
One-click purchasing
Amazon attempted to use patent originally granted to it in 1999 to force 
changes to Barnes & Noble’s website, but a federal court overturned a 
previously issued injunction. Eventually settled out of court. In 2007, a USPTO 
panel rejected some of the patent because of evidence another patent 
predated it. Amazon amended the patent, and the revised version was 
confirmed in 2010.
Priceline
Buyer-driven “name 
your price” sales
Originally filed by Walker Digital, an intellectual property laboratory, and then 
assigned to Priceline. Granted by the USPTO in 1999. Shortly thereafter, 
Priceline sued Microsoft and Expedia for copying its patented business 
method.
Akamai
Internet content 
delivery global hosting 
system
A broad patent granted in 2000 covering techniques for expediting the flow 
of information over the Internet. Akamai sued Digital Island for violating the 
patent and, in 2001, a jury found in its favor.
DoubleClick
Dynamic delivery of 
online advertising
The patent underlying DoubleClick’s business of online banner ad delivery, 
originally granted in 2000. DoubleClick sued competitors 24/7 Media and L90 
for violating the patent and ultimately reached a settlement with them.
Overture
Pay for performance 
search
System and method for influencing position on search result list generated by 
computer search engine, granted in 2001. Competitor FindWhat sued 
Overture, charging that patent was obtained illegally; Overture countered by 
suing both FindWhat and Google for violating patent. Google agreed to pay 
a license fee to Overture in 2004 to settle.
Acacia
Technologies
Streaming video media 
transmission
Patents for the receipt and transmission of streaming digital audio and/or 
video content originally granted to founders of Greenwich Information 
Technologies in 1990s. Patents were purchased by Acacia, a firm founded 
solely to enforce the patents, in 2001.
Soverain Software
Purchase technology
The so-called “shopping cart” patent for network-based systems, which 
involves any transaction over a network involving a seller, buyer, and 
payment system. In other words, e-commerce! Soverain filed suit against 
Amazon for patent infringement, which Amazon paid $40 million to settle. In 
2013 a federal district court ruled Soverain’s claims against Newegg in part 
invalid.
MercExchange
(Thomas Woolston)
Auction technology
Patents on person-to-person auctions and database search, originally granted 
in 1995. eBay ordered to pay $25 million in 2003 for infringing on patent. In 
2007, a motion for permanent patent injunction against eBay was denied. 
MercExchange and eBay settled the dispute in 2008 on confidential terms.
Google
Search technology
Google PageRank patent filed in 1998 and granted in 2001. Became non-
exclusive in 2011 and expires in 2017.
Google
Location technology
Patent for a method of using location information in an advertising system 
issued to Google in 2010.
Apple
Social technology
Apple applied for a patent in 2010 that allows groups of friends attending 
events to stay in communication with each other and share reactions to live 
events as they are occurring.
Facebook 
Social technology
A 2010 patent on an algorithm for developing personalized stories and 
newsfeeds on a social network.

law is twofold. First, trademark law protects the public in the marketplace by ensuring 
that it gets what it pays for and wants to receive. Second, trademark law protects the 
owner—who has spent time, money, and energy bringing the product to the market-
place—against piracy and misappropriation. Trademarks have been extended from 
single words to pictures, shapes, packaging, and colors. Some things may not be trade-
marked such as common words that are merely descriptive (“clock”). Federal trade-
marks are obtained, first, by use in interstate commerce, and second, by registration 
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Federal trademarks are granted 
for a period of 10 years and can be renewed indefinitely.
Disputes over federal trademarks involve establishing infringement. The test 
for infringement is twofold: market confusion and bad faith. Use of a trademark that 
creates confusion with existing trademarks, causes consumers to make market mis-
takes, or misrepresents the origins of goods is an infringement. For instance, in 2015, 
Multi Time Machine (MTM) sued Amazon for violation of its trademarks and confus-
ing consumers looking to buy MTM watches. MTM makes military style watches that 
are not sold on Amazon. If a user searches on Amazon for an MTM watch, the search 
results shows watches being offered by MTM competitors that are similar in style to 
MTM’s. MTM argued that this could confuse customers and the court agreed, allow-
ing the case to proceed to trial (Levine, 2015). In addition, the intentional misuse of 
words and symbols in the marketplace to extort revenue from legitimate trademark 
owners (“bad faith”) is proscribed.
In 1995, Congress passed the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (FTDA), which 
created a federal cause of action for dilution of famous marks. This legislation dis-
penses with the test of market confusion (although that is still required to claim 
infringement), and extends protection to owners of famous trademarks against dilu-
tion, which is defined as any behavior that would weaken the connection between 
the trademark and the product. In 2006, the FTDA was amended by the Trademark 
Dilution Revision Act (TDRA), which allows a trademark owner to file a claim based 
on a “likelihood of dilution” standard, rather than having to provide evidence of actual 
dilution. The TDRA also expressly provides that dilution may occur through blurring 
(weakening the connection between the trademark and the goods) and tarnishment 
(using the trademark in a way that makes the underlying products appear unsavory 
or unwholesome). Internationally, WIPO handles many cybersquatting cases under 
its Uniform Dispute Resolution Procedures. In 2014, WIPO warned that the expansion 
of generic top-level domains authorized by ICANN is likely to be very disruptive in 
terms of trademark protection (New, 2014). Although the cost of obtaining a new gTLD 
is not unsubstantial (it is estimated to be more than $180,000), by May 2015, 583 new 
gTLDs had been approved. Successful applicants become owners of these gTLDs, and 
can create and sell new domains with the gTLD suffix, such as Avenger.movie. Many 
of these new domains may potentially conflict with the established trademarks of 
others. 
To deal with these trademark conflicts, ICANN developed a set of procedures 
to rapidly resolve disputes called the Uniform Rapid Suspension System (URS), a 
domain name dispute procedure that allows a trademark owner to seek suspen-
dilution
any behavior that would 
weaken the connection 
between the trademark 
and the product

sion of a domain name in a new generic top-level domain (gTLD). ICANN also 
established a Trademark Clearing house as a repository of data on registered, court-
validated, or statute-protected trademarks. Trademark owners register their marks 
for a fee. 
One successful applicant for a new gTLD is Vox Populi Registry Ltd. Based in the 
U.K., Vox purchased the gTLD .sucks, and began selling domains such as Apple.sucks 
and CitiGroup.sucks exclusively to corporations who did not want their brand name 
associated with .sucks. At some point, .sucks domains will be available to the general 
public, at which point anyone would be able to create a new domain that potentially 
embarrasses a major brand name or casts it in a negative light (Bloomberg News, 
2015). ICANN has said it may seek remedies and has alerted the FTC and asked for an 
opinion on the legality of Vox Populi’s behavior. ICANN is not a regulatory agency with 
enforcement powers, and its agreement with new domain owners does not discuss 
their business models (Fung, 2015). 
Trademarks and the Internet
The rapid growth and commercialization of the Internet have provided unusual oppor-
tunities for existing firms with distinctive and famous trademarks to extend their 
brands to the Internet. These same developments have provided malicious individu-
als and firms the opportunity to squat on Internet domain names built upon famous 
marks, as well as attempt to confuse consumers and dilute famous or distinctive marks 
(including your personal name or a movie star’s name). The conflict between legiti-
mate trademark owners and malicious firms was allowed to fester and grow because 
Network Solutions Inc. (NSI), originally the Internet’s sole agency for domain name 
registration for many years, had a policy of “first come, first served.” This meant 
anyone could register any domain name that had not already been registered, regard-
less of the trademark status of the domain name. NSI was not authorized to decide 
trademark issues (Nash, 1997).
In response to a growing number of complaints from owners of famous trademarks 
who found their trademark names being appropriated by web entrepreneurs, Congress 
passed the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) in 1999. The 
ACPA creates civil liabilities for anyone who attempts in bad faith to profit from an 
existing famous or distinctive trademark by registering an Internet domain name that 
is identical or confusingly similar to, or “dilutive” of, that trademark. The act does not 
establish criminal sanctions. It proscribes using “bad-faith” domain names to extort 
money from the owners of the existing trademark (cybersquatting), or using the 
bad-faith domain to divert web traffic to the bad-faith domain that could harm the good 
will represented by the trademark, create market confusion, or tarnish or disparage 
the mark (cyberpiracy). It is conceivable that domains such as the previously 
described Apple.sucks might be seen as a kind of cybersquatting and a violation of the 
ACPA. The act also proscribes the use of a domain name that consists of the name of 
a living person, or a name confusingly similar to an existing personal name, without 
that person’s consent, if the registrant is registering the name with the intent to profit 
by selling the domain name to that person.

Trademark abuse can take many forms on the Web. Table 8.16 lists the major 
behaviors on the Internet that have run afoul of trademark law and some of the court 
cases that resulted.
Cybersquatting and Brandjacking
In one of the first cases involving the ACPA, E. & J. Gallo Winery, owner of the reg-
istered mark “Ernest and Julio Gallo” for alcoholic beverages, sued Spider Webs Ltd. 
for using the domain name Ernestandjuliogallo.com. Spider Webs Ltd. was a domain 
name speculator that owned numerous domain names consisting of famous company 
names. The Ernestandjuliogallo.com website contained information on the risks of 
alcohol use, anti-corporate articles about E. & J. Gallo Winery, and was poorly con-

structed. The court concluded that Spider Webs Ltd. was in violation of the ACPA and 
that its actions constituted dilution by blurring because the Ernestandjuliogallo.com 
domain name appeared on every page printed off the website accessed by that name, 
and that Spider Webs Ltd. was not free to use this particular mark as a domain name 
(E. & J. Gallo Winery v. Spider Webs Ltd., 2001). In 2009, a court upheld the largest 
cybersquatting judgment to date: a $33 million verdict in favor of Verizon against 
OnlineNIC, an Internet domain registration company that had used over 660 names 
that could easily be confused with legitimate Verizon domain names. Although there 
have not been many cases decided under the ACPA, that does not mean the problem 
has gone away. Impersonation of individuals and brands on social network sites adds 
another dimension to the problem. Both Twitter and Facebook make cybersquatting 
and impersonation a violation of their terms of service. 
However, it is not always easy for a firm to prevent trademark infringement by 
cybersquatters, or to prevent squatters from profiting from their infringing activities. In 
2015, for instance, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) accused 
domain registrar GoDaddy of cybersquatting (Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sci-
ences v. GoDaddy.com Inc et al., 2015). AMPAS claimed GoDaddy acted in bad faith 
by allowing customers to purchase 293 domain names such as Academyawards.net, 
Oscarsredacademyawards.net, Oscarsredcarpet.com, Billycrystal2012oscars.com, and 
Theoscargoestothehangover.com, and then sharing in the advertising revenues those 
pages generated. The court ruled that GoDaddy relied on representations of their users 
that their domain registrations did not infringe any trademarks, and that it took down 
domains after receiving takedown requests. AMPAS failed to prove intent to profit from 
AMPAS marks, according to the court. This suit demonstrates that trademark owners 
need to be vigilant in detecting infringement, sending takedown notices immediately, 
and following up to make sure the infringing sites are taken down. The burden is 
clearly on the trademark owner. The suit also demonstrates that cybersquatters have 
little incentive to stop trying to defraud and confuse consumers. If they are caught, 
their sites are taken down, but there is no penalty for trying (Stempel, 2015). 
Cyberpiracy
Cyberpiracy involves the same behavior as cybersquatting, but with the intent of 
diverting traffic from the legitimate site to an infringing site. In Ford Motor Co. v. 
Lapertosa, Lapertosa had registered and used a website called Fordrecalls.com as an 
adult entertainment website. The court ruled that Fordrecalls.com was in violation of 
the ACPA in that it was a bad-faith attempt to divert traffic to the Lapertosa site and 
diluted Ford’s wholesome trademark (Ford Motor Co. v. Lapertosa, 2001).
The Ford decision reflects two other famous cases of cyberpiracy. In the Paine 
Webber Inc. v. Fortuny case, the court enjoined Fortuny from using the domain name 
www.painewebber.com—a site that specialized in pornographic materials—because it 
diluted and tarnished Paine Webber’s trademark and diverted web traffic from Paine 
Webber’s legitimate site—Painewebber.com (Paine Webber Inc. v. Fortuny, 1999). In 
the Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Global Site Designs, Inc. case, the court enjoined the 
defendants from using the Playboy and Playmate marks in their domain names Play-
boyonline.net and Playmatesearch.net and from including the Playboy trademark in

their metatags. In these cases, the defendants’ intention was diversion for financial 
gain (Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Global Site Designs, Inc., 1999).
Typosquatting is a form of cyberpiracy in which a domain name contains a 
common misspelling of another site’s name. These domains are sometimes referred 
to as “doppelganger” domains. Often the user ends up at a site very different from 
one they intended to visit. For instance, John Zuccarini is an infamous typosquat-
ter who was jailed in 2002 for setting up pornographic websites with URLs based on 
misspellings of popular children’s brands, such as Bob the Builder and Teletubbies. 
The FTC fined him again in 2007 for engaging in similar practices (McMillan, 2007). 
Harvard Business School professor Ben Edelman conducted a study that found that 
there were at least 938,000 domains typosquatting on the top 3,264 “.com” websites, 
and that 57% of these domains included Google pay-per click ads. In 2011, Facebook 
filed a lawsuit against 25 typosquatters who established websites with such domain 
names as Faceboook, Facemook, Faceboik, and Facebooki. In 2013, Facebook was 
awarded $2.8 million in damages.
Metatagging
The legal status of using famous or distinctive marks as metatags is more complex and 
subtle. The use of trademarks in metatags is permitted if the use does not mislead or 
confuse consumers. Usually this depends on the content of the site. A car dealer would 
be permitted to use a famous automobile trademark in its metatags if the dealer sold 
this brand of automobiles, but a pornography site could not use the same trademark, 
nor a dealer for a rival manufacturer. A Ford dealer would most likely be infringing 
if it used “Honda” in its metatags, but would not be infringing if it used “Ford” in its 
metatags. (Ford Motor Company would be unlikely to seek an injunction against one 
of its dealers.)
In the Bernina of America, Inc. v. Fashion Fabrics Int’l, Inc. case, the court enjoined 
Fashion Fabrics, an independent dealer of sewing machines, from using the trade-
marks “Bernina” and “Bernette,” which belonged to the manufacturer Bernina, as 
metatags. The court found the defendant’s site contained misleading claims about 
Fashion Fabrics’ knowledge of Bernina products that were likely to confuse customers. 
The use of the Bernina trademarks as metatags per se was not a violation of ACPA, 
according to the court, but in combination with the misleading claims on the site 
would cause confusion and hence infringement (Bernina of America, Inc. v. Fashion 
Fabrics Int’l, Inc., 2001).
In the Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. v. Nissan Computer Corp. case, Uzi Nissan had used 
his surname “Nissan” as a trade name for various businesses since 1980, including 
Nissan Computer Corp. Nissan.com had no relationship with Nissan Motor, but over 
the years began selling auto parts that competed with Nissan Motor. The court ruled 
that Nissan Computer’s behavior did indeed infringe on Nissan Motor’s trademarks, 
but it refused to shut the site down. Instead, the court ruled Nissan Computer could 
continue to use the Nissan name and metatags, but must post notices on its site that 
it was not affiliated with Nissan Motor (Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. v. Nissan Computer 
Corp., 2000).

Keywording
The permissibility of using trademarks as keywords on search engines is also subtle 
and depends (1) on the extent to which such use is considered to be a “use in com-
merce” and causes “initial customer confusion” and (2) on the content of the search 
results.
In Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications, Inc., Playboy objected to 
the practice of Netscape’s and Excite’s search engines displaying banner ads unre-
lated to Playboy Magazine when users entered search arguments such as “playboy,” 
“playmate,” and “playgirl.” The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the defendant’s 
motion for a summary judgment and held that when an advertiser’s banner ad is not 
labeled so as to identify its source, the practice could result in trademark infringement 
due to consumer confusion (Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications, Inc., 
2004).
Google has also faced lawsuits alleging that its advertising network illegally 
exploits others’ trademarks. For instance, insurance company GEICO challenged 
Google’s practice of allowing competitors’ ads to appear when a searcher types “Geico” 
as the search query. A U.S. district court ruled that this practice did not violate federal 
trademark laws as long as the word “Geico” was not used in the ads’ text (Government 
Employees Insurance Company v. Google, Inc., 2004). Google quickly discontinued allow-
ing the latter, and settled the case (Associated Press, 2005). In 2009, Rosetta Stone, the 
language-learning software firm, filed a lawsuit against Google for trademark infringe-
ment, alleging its AdWords program allowed other companies to use Rosetta Stone’s 
trademarks for online advertisements without permission. In 2012, the 4th Circuit 
Court of Appeals held that a jury might hold Google liable for trademark infringement, 
pointing to evidence that an internal Google study found that even sophisticated users 
were sometimes unaware that sponsored links were advertisements. In 2012, Rosetta 
Stone and Google settled, which was seen as a strategic win for Google because it elimi-
nated one of the last major cases challenging the legitimacy of its AdWords program. 
Currently Google allows anyone to buy anyone else’s trademark as a keyword. In 2011, 
Microsoft decided to follow this practice as well with Bing and Yahoo Search.
Linking
Linking refers to building hypertext links from one site to another site. This is obvi-
ously a major design feature and benefit of the Web. Deep linking involves bypassing 
the target site’s home page and going directly to a content page. In Ticketmaster Corp. 
v. Tickets.com, Tickets.com—owned by Microsoft—competed directly against Ticket-
master in the events ticket market. When Tickets.com did not have tickets for an 
event, it would direct users to Ticketmaster’s internal pages, bypassing the Ticketmas-
ter home page. Even though its logo was displayed on the internal pages, Ticketmas-
ter objected on the grounds that such “deep linking” violated the terms and conditions 
of use for its site (stated on a separate page altogether and construed by Ticketmaster 
as equivalent to a shrink-wrap license), and constituted false advertising, as well as 
the violation of copyright. The court found, however, that deep linking per se is not 
illegal, no violation of copyright occurred because no copies were made, the terms 
linking
building hypertext links 
from one site to another 
site
deep linking
involves bypassing the 
target site’s home page, 
and going directly to a 
content page

and conditions of use were not obvious to users, and users were not required to read 
the page on which the terms and conditions of use appeared in any event. The court 
refused to rule in favor of Ticketmaster, but left open further argument on the licens-
ing issue. In an out-of-court settlement, Tickets.com nevertheless agreed to stop the 
practice of deep linking (Ticketmaster v. Tickets.com, 2000).
Framing
Framing involves displaying the content of another website inside your own website 
within a frame or window. The user never leaves the framer’s site and can be exposed 
to advertising while the target site’s advertising is distorted or eliminated. Framers 
may or may not acknowledge the source of the content. In The Washington Post, et al. 
v. TotalNews, Inc., The Washington Post Company, CNN, Reuters, and several other 
news organizations filed suit against TotalNews, Inc., claiming that TotalNews’s use of 
frames on its website, TotalNews.com, infringed upon the respective plaintiffs’ copy-
rights and trademarks, and diluted the content of their individual websites. The plain-
tiffs claimed additionally that TotalNews’s framing practice effectively deprived the 
plaintiffs’ websites of advertising revenue.
TotalNews’s website employed four frames. The TotalNews logo appeared in the 
lower left frame, various links were located in a vertical frame on the left side of the 
screen, TotalNews’s advertising was framed across the screen bottom, and the “news 
frame,” the largest frame, appeared in the center and right. Clicking on a specific 
news organization’s link allowed the reader to view the content of that particular 
organization’s website, including any related advertising, within the context of the 
“news frame.” In some instances, the framing distorted or modified the appearance 
of the linked website, including the advertisements, while the appearance of Total-
News’s advertisements, in a separate frame, remained unchanged. In addition, the 
URL remained fixed on the TotalNews address, even though the content in the largest 
frame on the website was from the linked website. The “news frame” did not, however, 
eliminate the linked website’s identifying features.
The case was settled out of court. The news organizations allowed TotalNews to 
link to their websites, but prohibited framing and any attempt to imply affiliation with 
the news organizations (The Washington Post, et al. v. TotalNews, Inc., 1997).
TRADE SECRETS
Much of the value created by a firm lies not in copyrights, patents, or even trade-
marks. There is a kind of intellectual property that has to do with business proce-
dures, formulas, and methods of manufacture and service delivery, from which the 
firm derives value and which it does not want to share with others in the form of a 
patent application or copyright application. This type of intellectual property is 
referred to as trade secrets. Most famously, the formula for Coca Cola is considered 
a trade secret, as are the manufacturing techniques for producing General Electric’s 
jet engine turbine blades. Trade secrets differ from other copyright and patent pro-
tections because they may not be unique or novel. Information in a firm can be 
considered a trade secret if (a) it is a secret (something that others do not know), (b)

information that is secret,

has commercial value to its owner, and (c) the owner has taken steps to protect the 
secret. U.S. corporations are believed to own trillions of dollars of trade secrets 
(Gershman, 2016). 
Until recently, trade secrets were defined and enforced mostly in state laws 
because historically businesses were local, as was theft of business trade secrets. In the 
digital age, when business is national and global, a new level of protection is needed 
that would make it easier to enforce trade secret laws. In 2016, President Obama signed 
the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA), which creates a federal private right of action 
for trade secret protection. DTSA is a response to the large-scale theft of trade secrets 
(also known as economic sabotage) by hackers and foreign nations from American 
corporate and government information systems. The European Union is developing a 
similar Trade Secrets Directive to protect European firms and nations  (Crouch, 2016). 
According to the U.S. Patent and Trade Office, the theft of trade secrets is one of the 
largest transfers of wealth in history, costing U.S. firms $300 billion a year (Lee, 2016). 
However, it is unclear if the new Act actually will be capable of protecting firms from 
theft of trade secrets. 
CHALLENGE: BALANCING THE PROTECTION OF PROPERTY WITH OTHER 
VALUES
The challenge in intellectual property ethics and law is to ensure that creators of 
intellectual property can receive the benefits of their inventions and works, while 
also making it possible for their works and designs to be disseminated and used by 
the widest possible audience. Protections from rampant theft of intellectual prop-
erty inevitably lead to restrictions on distribution, which then restricts payments to 
creators for the use of their works—which in itself can slow down the distribution 
process. Without these protections, however, and without the benefits that flow to 
creators of intellectual property, the pace of innovation could decline. In the early 
years of e-commerce, up to 2005, the balance has been struck more toward Internet 
distributors and their claim to be free from restrictions on intellectual content, par-
ticularly music. Since the development of the iTunes store, smartphones, and tablets, 
after 2005, the balance has swung back toward content owners, largely because 
Internet distributors depend on high-quality content to attract audiences, but also 
partly due to the effectiveness of lawsuits in raising the costs to Internet firms that 
fail to protect intellectual property.

GOVERNANCE
Governance has to do with social control: Who will control the Internet? Who will 
control the processes of e-commerce, the content, and the activities? What elements 
will be controlled, and how will the controls be implemented? A natural question 
arises and needs to be answered: Why do we as a society need to “control” e-com-
merce? Because e-commerce and the Internet are so closely intertwined (though not 
identical), controlling e-commerce also involves regulating the Internet.

CAN THE INTERNET BE CONTROLLED?
Early Internet advocates argued that the Internet was different from all previous 
technologies. They contended that the Internet could not be controlled, given its 
inherent decentralized design, its ability to cross borders, and its underlying packet-
switching technology that made monitoring and controlling message content impos-
sible. Many still believe this to be true today. The implication is that the content 
and behavior of e-commerce sites—indeed Internet sites of any kind—cannot be 
“controlled” in the same way. Content issues such as pornography, gambling, and 
offensive written expressions and graphics, along with commercial issue of intel-
lectual property protection, ushered in the current era of growing governmental 
regulation of the Internet and e-commerce throughout the world. Currently, we 
are in a mixed-mode policy environment where self-regulation through a variety of 
Internet policy and technical bodies co-exists with limited government regulation 
(Stone, 2010). See Chapter 3 for a review of the different governing bodies involved 
in overseeing the Internet, including ICANN and IANA, and changes in the United 
States’ authority over IANA.
In fact, as you learned in the Chapter 3 Insight on Society case, Government Regula-
tion and Surveillance of the Internet, the Internet is technically very easily controlled, 
monitored, and regulated from central locations (such as network access points, 
telecommunication firm or agency fiber trunk lines, as well as servers and routers 
throughout the network). For instance, in China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, North Korea, 
Thailand, Singapore, and many other countries, access to the Web is controlled from 
government-owned centralized routers that direct traffic across their borders and 
within the country (such as China’s “Great Firewall of China,” which permits the gov-
ernment to block access to certain U.S. or European websites), or via tightly regulated 
ISPs operating within the countries. In China, for instance, all ISPs need a license from 
the Ministry of Information Industry (MII), and are prohibited from disseminating 
any information that may harm the state or permit pornography, gambling, or the 
advocacy of cults. In addition, ISPs and search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and 
Bing typically self-censor their Asian content by using only government-approved 
news sources or, in the case of Google, exit the country altogether. Twitter is not plan-
ning any Chinese presence. China has also instituted regulations that require cafes, 
restaurants, hotels, and bookstores to install web monitoring software that identifies 
those using wireless services and monitors web activity. Because of the design of the 
Internet, a substantial part of global Internet traffic flows through U.S. telecommu-
nication facilities.
Following the outbreak of street demonstrations in 2009 protesting a rigged elec-
tion, the Iranian government unleashed one of the world’s most sophisticated mecha-
nisms for controlling and censoring the Web. Built with the assistance of Western 
companies like Siemens and Nokia, the system uses deep packet inspection to open 
every packet, look for keywords, reseal it, and send it on the network.
In the United States, as we have seen in our discussion of intellectual property, 
e-commerce sites can be put out of business for violating existing laws, and ISPs can 
be forced to “take down” offending or stolen content. Government security agencies 
such as the NSA and the FBI can obtain court orders to monitor ISP traffic and engage

in widespread monitoring of millions of e-mail messages. Under the USA PATRIOT 
Act, American intelligence authorities are permitted to tap into whatever Internet 
traffic they believe is relevant to the campaign against terrorism, in some limited cir-
cumstances without judicial review. Working with the large ISP firms such as AT&T, 
Verizon, and others, U.S. security agencies have access to nearly all Internet commu-
nications throughout the country. And many American corporations are developing 
restrictions on their employees’ at-work use of the Web to prevent gambling, shopping, 
and other activities not related to a business purpose.
In the United States, efforts to control media content on the Web have run up 
against equally powerful social and political values that protect freedom of expression, 
including several rulings by the Supreme Court that have struck down laws attempting 
to limit online content in the United States. The U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment 
says, “Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.” 
As it turns out, the 200-year-old Bill of Rights has been a powerful brake on efforts to 
control twenty-first-century online content.
TAXATION
Few questions illustrate the complexity of governance and jurisdiction more potently 
than taxation of e-commerce sales. In both Europe and the United States, governments 
rely on sales taxes based on the type and value of goods sold. In Europe, these taxes 
are collected along the entire value chain, including the final sale to the consumer, 
and are called “value-added taxes” (VAT), whereas in the United States, taxes are col-
lected by states and localities on final sales to consumers and are called consumption 
and use taxes. In the United States, there are 50 states, 3,000 counties, and 12,000 
municipalities, each with unique tax rates and policies. Cheese may be taxable in one 
state as a “snack food” but not taxable in another state (such as Wisconsin), where it is 
considered a basic food. Consumption taxes are generally recognized to be regressive 
because they disproportionately tax poorer people, for whom consumption is a larger 
part of their total income. Nevertheless, state and local sales taxes are a major source 
of revenue, especially in states where there are no income taxes.
Sales taxes were first implemented in the United States in the late 1930s as a 
Depression-era method of raising money for localities. Ostensibly, the money was to 
be used to build infrastructure such as roads, schools, and utilities to support busi-
ness development, but over the years the funds have been used for general govern-
ment purposes of the states and localities. In most states, there is a state-based sales 
tax, and a smaller local sales tax. The total sales tax ranges from zero in some states 
(North Dakota) to as much as 13% in New York City for the combined state and city 
sales taxes.
The development of “remote sales” such as mail order/telephone order (MOTO) 
retail in the United States in the 1970s broke the relationship between physical pres-
ence and commerce, complicating the plans of state and local tax authorities to tax all 
retail commerce. States sought to force MOTO retailers to collect sales taxes for them 
based on the address of the recipient, but Supreme Court decisions in 1967 and 1992 
established that states had no authority to force MOTO retailers to collect state taxes 
unless the businesses had a “nexus” of operations (physical presence) in the state.

The explosive growth of e-commerce, the latest type of “remote sales,” has once 
again raised the issue of how—and if—to tax remote sales. Since its inception, e-com-
merce has benefited from a tax subsidy of up to 13% for goods shipped to high sales-
tax areas. Local retail merchants have complained bitterly about the e-commerce tax 
subsidy. E-commerce merchants have argued that this form of commerce needs to 
be nurtured and encouraged, and that in any event, the crazy quilt of sales and use 
tax regimes would be difficult to administer for Internet merchants. Online giants 
like Amazon claim they should not have to pay taxes in states where they have no 
operations because they do not benefit from local schools, police, fire, and other gov-
ernmental services. State and local governments meanwhile see billions of tax dollars 
slipping from their reach. As Amazon’s business model has changed with its building 
of large distribution centers close to urban areas to enable next-day delivery, so has 
its opposition to paying sales taxes softened. In 2015, the Supreme Court upheld a 
challenge to a Colorado law that would have required firms to report online sales to 
state residents as one step to ensure the residents paid taxes on such sales in Colorado, 
which is required by state law.  So far, 13 states have defied the Supreme Court ruling 
by imposing their own sales taxes on online purchases made by state residents in 
the hope of forcing lawsuits and potentially a new Supreme Court ruling, especially 
because the court also stated that the premise of allowing online sales by out-of-state 
firms like Amazon to go untaxed in order to support e-commerce sales was no longer 
appropriate, when e-commerce has exploded to a $600 billion marketplace. A recent 
study found that states lost $23 billion in revenue since 2012 because of e-commerce 
sales that went untaxed. The Insight on Business case, Internet Sales Tax Battle, provides 
further insight into the fight over e-commerce sales taxes.
In 1998, Congress passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which placed a mora-
torium on “multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce,” as well as on 
taxes on Internet access, for three years until 2001. Since that time, the moratorium 
has been extended several times, and in 2016, Congress made the ban permanent. 
The taxation situation in Europe, and trade between Europe and the United States, 
is similarly complex. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD), the economic policy coordinating body of European, American, and Japanese 
governments, is currently investigating different schemes for applying consumption 
and business profit taxes for digitally downloaded goods. The European Union began 
collecting a VAT on digital goods such as music and software delivered to consumers 
by foreign companies in 2003. Previously, E.U. companies were required to collect 
the VAT on sales to E.U. customers, but U.S. companies were not. This gave American 
companies a huge tax edge. European countries have other tax issues with Internet 
companies like Google, Apple, Yahoo, and others, that sell goods to consumers in one 
country, but book the sales in a low-tax country like Ireland.
NET NEUTRALITY
Net neutrality refers to the idea that ISPs, including cable Internet and wireless car-
riers, should treat all data on the Internet in the same manner, and not discriminate 
or price differentially by content, protocol, platform, hardware, or application. Prior 
to February 2015, ISPs could discriminate against certain users on the basis of protocol 
net neutrality
the concept that Internet 
service providers should 
treat all Internet traffic 
equally (or “neutrally”)

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
INTERNET SALES TAX BATTLE
Most people are happy when they 
discover they don’t have to pay any 
sales tax on a purchase they make 
online. However, few stop to consider 
the implications of their tax-free pur-
chases. Many of the 45 states that levy 
sales taxes have been eyeing the lost revenue from 
e-commerce sales, estimated at nearly $14 billion 
a year nationwide. Economists point out that the 
lost revenue from out-of-state e-commerce sales 
affects not only state and local sales tax collec-
tions, but also jobs and ultimately, state income 
tax collections as well.
Internet sales tax policy has been dictated 
by the Supreme Court decision in Quill v. North 
Dakota, which held that retailers without a store 
or other physical presence (nexus) in a state 
could not be forced to collect state sales taxes. 
Citizens were supposed to be responsible for 
remitting unpaid sales tax along with their state 
income tax returns. This unsurprisingly resulted in 
nearly universal noncompliance. The rationale for 
not closing this loophole was to provide protec-
tion for nascent e-commerce markets. With total 
2016 B2C e-commerce sales expected to top 
$600 billion in the United States, this protection 
is clearly no longer necessary. Recent Supreme 
Court have suggested that the Supreme Court 
might be willing to reconsider its previous deci-
sion in the Quill case, with Supreme Court Justice 
Anthony Kennedy writing in one instance that the 
Quill decision harms states and single-state busi-
nesses to a much greater degree than anticipated. 
Internet retail kingpin Amazon has been at 
the center of the political battle. Multiple states, 
frustrated by the lost revenue that could have been 
used to balance their budgets and prevent further 
layoffs, have taken the fight to Amazon. Texas, 
Illinois, New York, Rhode Island, California, and 
North Carolina were some of the first states to 
take aim at Amazon via tax bills and legislation 
intended to get the e-tailer to pay its share of sales 
taxes. Facing a continuing state-by-state assault, 
Amazon devised a dual-pronged strategy. In the 
short term, it negotiated deals with states in which 
it planned to open distribution centers. These dis-
tribution centers were strategically located to 
support its long-term goal and what it hopes will 
become its new competitive advantage—same day 
delivery.
For example, in 2012, Amazon settled its 
dispute with Texas when it agreed to create 2,500 
local jobs over four years’ time, pay an undisclosed 
amount to resolve its tax bill, and begin collecting 
sales tax from Texas residents. Amazon reached a 
similar agreement with New Jersey that allowed 
it to build two distribution centers in the state. 
Amazon will also receive yet to be determined 
tax incentives from the state Economic Develop-
ment Authority. In California, in exchange for a 
one-year tax reprieve, Amazon agreed to spend 
$500 million building new facilities, which also 
positioned it for same-day delivery in two major 
metropolitan areas. In 2015, Amazon withdrew 
requests for tax breaks in Minnesota as it made 
plans to build a new distribution center there.
Amazon also hopes that the federal govern-
ment will step in soon. In 2011, Amazon threw 
its support behind a bill called the Main Street 
Fairness Act. Under the terms of the bill, busi-
nesses with less than $1 million in annual sales 
would not have had to remit sales taxes. States 
would have had to agree to the Streamlined Sales 
and Use Tax Agreement, which adjusted their tax 
policies in order to simplify compliance for retail-
ers. Now known as the Marketplace Fairness Act 
(MFA), the bill cleared the Senate in 2013 but 
has struggled to pass in the House of Representa-

tives, where lawmakers are concerned that 
the MFA (now renamed the Remote Transac-
tion Parity Act) would force small businesses 
to manage over 9,000 state and local tax codes, 
and that supporting a new law that looks and 
sounds like a new tax would be unpopular. The 
bill would create a uniform set of rules for col-
lecting taxes from e-commerce sales. The states 
that don’t collect any sales tax (Alaska, Oregon, 
New Hampshire, Montana, and Delaware) are 
also opponents of the bill, as it would force them 
to levy taxes that would otherwise not be part of 
their own tax code.
It’s no surprise that Amazon, Walmart, Best 
Buy, and other retailers have lobbied heavily in 
favor of the bill, which would eliminate a major 
advantage for many of their smaller competi-
tors. Perhaps hedging its bets in case the bill does 
not pass, Amazon has continued to battle indi-
vidual states on their rights to collect sales tax 
on e-commerce purchases. But increasingly, the 
company is accepting that it is fighting a losing 
battle. Amazon now collects sales tax from over 
84% of all U.S. consumers in 28 states, including 
most of the most highly populated states. Resi-
dents in Indiana, Nevada, and Tennessee began 
paying sales taxes in 2014, and in 2015, Illinois 
and Michigan joined the ranks of states where 
Amazon collects sales taxes. In 2016, South 
Carolinians began paying tax on their Amazon 
purchases, and a protracted legal battle in Colo-
rado over the constitutionality of its online sales 
tax law came to an end, with a federal appeals 
court ruling that the law should stand and Amazon 
agreeing to remit sales taxes in the state. Alabama 
also implemented a sales tax law in direct con-
tradiction of the Quill decision in 2016, hoping 
to prompt retailers to sue them and that either 
Congress or the Supreme Court will step in and 
resolve the case once and for all on the national 
level. South Dakota enacted a similar law, prompt-
ing some retailers like online jeweler Blue Nile to 
cease sales to and operations within the state, and 
followed up by proactively suing several promi-
nent national retailers like Newegg and Overstock.
com to potentially draw the notice of the Supreme 
Court. 
Amazon continues to fight new tax laws 
where it can, withdrawing affiliate programs in 
states like Louisiana, Arkansas, Maine, Missouri, 
Rhode Island, and Vermont, in response to laws 
that require companies with a nexus in a state to 
remit sales taxes there. In 2016, the House intro-
duced legislation in response to Colorado, South 
Dakota, and Alabama’s new laws that more clearly 
defines different types of nexus. The law disallows 
states from collecting tax from merchants that 
don’t satisfy the bill’s nexus requirements, which 
include ownership of a physical location, employ-
ees, an office, and personal property in the state. 
Called the No Regulation without Representation 
Act of 2016, the law is still in its preliminary 
phases, but is likely to meet resistance from state 
and local governments.

or amount of usage. For instance, users of illegal downloading sites that utilize the 
BitTorrent protocol were blocked or throttled back (Internet speeds were slowed). 
Users who watched large volumes of movies on Netflix or other services were occa-
sionally throttled back; wireless cellphone carriers choked off data speeds for heavy 
users when their networks became clogged; and large Internet services like Netflix 
and YouTube, that together consume an estimated 50% of the Internet’s bandwidth in 
the United States, were encouraged to strike deals with ISPs and pay a higher fee than 
ordinary business or home users (Gryta, 2015a). 
ISPs had long opposed the idea of net neutrality. ISPs claimed they needed to be 
able to manage the loads on their networks to ensure stable service, without blackouts 
or slowdowns. Throttling back heavy users was necessary to manage network load. 
They also argued that heavy individual or business users should pay more than the 
average user at home who uses the Web for e-mail, web surfing, and e-commerce, all 
of which do not require a lot of bandwidth. More to the point, the ISPs claimed the 
FCC did not have the authority to regulate ISPs because ISPs were not defined by the 
FCC as common carriers like traditional telephone companies. ISPs instead were clas-
sified in FCC regulations of the 1990s as information services in large part because 
the Internet, at that time, was considered to be a innovative provider of information 
that should be nurtured and not interfered with or regulated by the FCC. The Internet 
then was just not that important to the operation of society. 
This view ended on February 15, 2015, when the FCC ruled that Internet broad-
band service providers really should be viewed as public utilities similar to telephone 
companies, and therefore should be regulated by the FCC in order to ensure fair access 
to all, deployment of acceptable broadband service levels, and competition among 
providers. This change reflected the fact that the Internet had evolved by 2015 into 
one of the primary telecommunications services in the country, and world, necessary 
to the everyday life of millions of people, businesses, and governments, and therefore 
a common carrier vital to the operation of society (just like a railroad service). The 
FCC was created by the Communications Act of 1934 to regulate telegraph and radio, 
and then later added regulation of television, satellite, and cable in all states. The FCC 
also overruled state laws that made it difficult for cities to operate their own broad-
band networks. In this way, a decades-long debate over net neutrality moved a step 
towards resolution. The ruling does not provide for regulation of ISP pricing, which 
remains in the hands of the ISPs (Gryta, 2015b). In 2016, a federal appeals court upheld 
the FCC view that ISPs were utilities that act as neutral indiscriminate platforms for 
transmission of speech. 
However, the debate over net neutrality is not yet over. The large telecommuni-
cations carriers are preparing legal challenges to the FCC ruling. Yet there is strong 
public support for regulation of ISPs to ensure faster broadband deployment, more 
competition to reduce prices, and service level improvements. Popular services 
like Netflix, Google, and many other Internet content giants publicly supported 
the FCC decision as a win for consumers (Ruiz, 2015). Next on the FCC agenda is a 
proposed rule to end the cable companies’ monopoly on TV set-top boxes by allow-
ing the development of devices and apps that would permit consumers to control 
their cable TV in a manner similar to how they control their Internet access using

smartphones or computers (McKinnon, 2016). The cable industry strongly opposes 
this proposed ruling.

PUBLIC SAFETY AND WELFARE
Governments everywhere claim to pursue public safety, health, and welfare. This 
effort produces laws governing everything from weights and measures to national 
highways, to the content of radio and television programs. Electronic media of all 
kinds (telegraph, telephone, radio, and television) have historically been regulated by 
governments seeking to develop a rational commercial telecommunications environ-
ment and to control the content of the media—which may be critical of government or 
offensive to powerful groups in a society. Historically, in the United States, newspapers 
and print media have been beyond government controls because of constitutional 
guarantees of freedom of speech. Electronic media such as radio and television have, 
on the other hand, always been subject to content regulation because they use the 
publicly owned frequency spectrum and hence come under a variety of federal laws 
and regulatory agencies, primarily the FCC. Telephones have also been regulated as 
public utilities and “common carriers,” with special social burdens to provide service 
and access, but with no limitations on content.
In the United States, critical issues in e-commerce center around the protection 
of children, strong sentiments against pornography in any public media, efforts to 
control gambling, and the protection of public health through restricting sales of drugs 
and cigarettes.
PROTECTING CHILDREN
Pornography is an immensely successful Internet business. Statistics with respect to 
revenues generated by online pornography range widely. Reports of web traffic to 
pornography sites constituting 30% of all web traffic are likely not true and have no 
solid foundation. A sample of the million most-visited sites in the world found that 4% 
of the websites contained pornographic material, and 14% of web searches involved 
sexual content (Ward, 2013). Online pornography is estimated to generate $10 to $12 
billion annually in the United States, and the global revenue is estimated to be $97 
billion. Traditional DVD porn revenues have fallen off by 80% as so-called tube sites 
(YouTube for porn) have rapidly expanded with free and freemium content online. 
Piracy is rampant as with traditional video content. Revenues are now primarily 
derived from premium subscriptions and advertising. 
To control the Web as a distribution medium for pornography, in 1996, Congress 
passed the Communications Decency Act (CDA). This act made it a felony criminal 
offense to use any telecommunications device to transmit “any comment, request, 
suggestion, proposal, image, or other communications which is obscene, lewd, las-
civious, filthy, or indecent” to anyone, and in particular, to persons under 18 years of 
age (Section 502, Communications Decency Act of 1996). In 1997, the Supreme Court 
struck down most of the CDA as an unconstitutional abridgement of freedom of speech 
protected by the First Amendment. While the government argued the CDA was like 

a zoning ordinance designed to allow “adult” websites for people 18 years of age or 
over, the Court found the CDA was a blanket proscription on content and rejected the 
“cyberzoning” argument as impossible to administer. One section of the CDA that did 
survive scrutiny, Section 230, provides immunity for providers and users of interac-
tive computer services (such as ISPs and websites) from being considered a publisher 
that might be liable for harmful content posted by others. This is the law that allows 
social networks, blogs, and online bulletin boards to operate without fear of being held 
liable for online defamation or libel. In 2002, the Supreme Court struck down another 
law, the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, which made it a crime to create, 
distribute, or possess “virtual” child pornography that uses computer-generated images 
or young adults rather than real children, as overly broad (Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coali-
tion). The Children’s Online Protection Act (COPA) of 1998 met with a similar fate.
In 2001, Congress passed the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA), which 
requires schools and libraries in the United States to install “technology protection 
measures” (filtering software) in an effort to shield children from pornography. In 
2003, the Supreme Court upheld CIPA, overturning a federal district court that found 
the law interfered with the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of expression. 
The Supreme Court, in a 6–3 opinion, held that the law’s limitations on access to the 
Internet posed no more a threat to freedom of expression than limitations on access 
to books that librarians choose for whatever reason not to acquire. The dissenting 
justices found this analogy inappropriate and instead argued the proper analogy was 
if librarians were to purchase encyclopedias and then rip out pages they thought 
were or might be offensive to patrons. All the justices agreed that existing blocking 
software was overly blunt, unable to distinguish child pornography from sexually 
explicit material (which is protected by the First Amendment), and generally unre-
liable (Greenhouse, 2003b). Other legislation such as the 2002 Domain Names Act 
seeks to prevent unscrupulous website operators from luring children to pornography 
using misleading domain names or characters known to children. A plan to create an 
.xxx domain for adult website content was approved by ICANN in 2010, and in 2011, 
limited registration for .xxx domains began. Trademark holders who do not wish their 
brand to be associated with an .xxx domain can block requests by other companies for 
domain names that include their brand name. The 2003 Protect Act is an omnibus law 
intended to prevent child abuse that includes prohibitions against computer-generated 
child pornography. Part of that statute was previously held to be unconstitutional by 
the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, but in 2008, the Supreme Court reversed the 
circuit court and upheld the provision (Greenhouse, 2008).
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) (1998) prohibits websites 
from collecting information on children under the age of 13. It does permit such data 
collection if parental consent is obtained. Because COPPA does not interfere with 
speech or expression, it has not been challenged in the courts. However, since 1998, 
entirely new technologies like social networks, online tracking, advertising networks, 
online gaming, and mobile apps have appeared that are now being used to gather data 
on children and which were not specifically addressed in COPPA or FTC regulations. 
Responding to these changes in technology and public pressure, the FTC announced 
a new set of rules that are now in effect. The new rules prohibit online tracking of 
children across the Web with cookies or any other technology such as persistent identi-

fiers; prohibit ad networks from following children across the Web and advertising to 
them without parental consent; make clear that mobile devices are subject to COPPA, 
including games and software apps; and make clear that third-party data collection 
firms that collect data on websites are responsible for any unlawful data collection. 
See the Chapter 7 Insight on Society case, Marketing to Children of the Web in the Age of 
Social Networks, for more information. 
Search engines and ISPs also have a role to play in eliminating child pornography 
from the Web. The Internet Watch Foundation is a private non-profit organization 
based in the United Kingdom whose mission is to eliminate child pornography from 
the Web, and has over 200 corporate members from the Internet technology com-
munity (Internet Watch Foundation, 2015). In 2015, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, 
and Twitter joined together and are using the Internet Watch Foundation’s hash list 
to remove abusive child images from their services. Other companies working with 
the Internet Watch Foundation include Cisco, Blackberry, Dropbox, and PayPal (Lien, 
2015). But when tech companies become censors of content it places them in the 
tricky position of being media companies that determine the news, opinions, and art 
shown to their subscribers. Facebook, Google, Yahoo, and others involved in content 
delivery strongly deny this characterization, and instead claim to be purely pipelines 
for content. For instance, in 2016 Facebook removed a Pulitzer Prize winning photo 
of a naked 9-year old girl fleeing napalm bombs during the Vietnam War with tears 
streaming down her face because it violated their standards on child pornography. 
After thousands of people around the world protested by posting the picture on their 
Facebook pages, the company restored the photo, saying it recognized the global 
importance of this image in documenting a moment in history (Scott and Isaac, 2016). 
Analysts speculate that Facebook may be the most important editor on earth because 
it selects the content that billions of people see online. 
CIGARETTES, GAMBLING, AND DRUGS: IS THE WEB REALLY BORDERLESS?
In the United States, both the states and the federal government have adopted legis-
lation to control certain activities and products in order to protect public health and 
welfare. Cigarettes, gambling, medical drugs, and of course addictive recreational drugs 
are either banned or tightly regulated by federal and state laws (see Insight on Society: 
The Internet Drug Bazaar). Yet these products and services are ideal for distribution 
over the Internet through e-commerce sites. Because the sites can be located offshore, 
they can operate beyond the jurisdiction of state and federal prosecutors. Or so it 
seemed until recently. In the case of cigarettes, state and federal authorities have been 
quite successful in shutting down tax-free cigarette websites within the United States 
by pressuring PayPal and credit card firms to drop cigarette merchants from their 
systems. The major shipping companies—UPS, FedEx, and DHL—have been pressured 
into refusing shipment of untaxed cigarettes. Philip Morris has also agreed not to ship 
cigarettes to any resellers that have been found to be engaging in illegal Internet and 
mail order sales. However, a few offshore websites continue to operate using checks 
and money orders as payments and the postal system as a logistics partner, but their 
level of business has plummeted as consumers fear state tax authorities will present 
them with huge tax bills if they are discovered using these sites. In 2010, President

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
THE INTERNET DRUG BAZAAR
In June 2016, Interpol announced 
the results of its ninth-annual Oper-
ation Pangea effort to combat sales 
of illegal drugs online. The operation 
shut down almost 5,000 websites and 
resulted in the arrest of 393 people and 
the seizure of 712 million doses of illegal drugs 
worth $53 million. Despite successes such as this, 
however, the Internet drug bazaar operated by 
rogue Internet drug outlets remains a continuing 
public health and safety issue. 
A Google search for drugs “no prescrip-
tion” in 2016, for instance, returns more than 27 
million results. In many countries, trafficking in 
illegal prescription drugs now equals or exceeds 
the sale of heroin, cocaine, and amphetamines. 
While properly regulated Internet pharmacies 
offer a valuable service by increasing competition 
and access to treatments in underserved regions, 
online pharmacies are a long way from proper 
regulation. A whopping 96% of the 11,000 web-
sites selling medications online to U.S. consumers 
in 2016 do not comply with U.S. laws.
The sale of drugs without a prescription is 
not the only danger posed by the Internet drug 
bazaar. Rogue online pharmacy sites may be 
selling counterfeit drugs or unapproved drugs. For 
instance, the FDA has issued past warnings that 
consumers who had purchased Ambien, Xanax, 
and Lexapro online had instead received a product 
containing haloperial, a powerful anti-psychotic 
drug. Google and other search engines have come 
under fire for their relationships with purveyors 
of illegal drugs and other unlawful products like 
stolen credit cards and fake IDs, and both FedEx 
and UPS have had lawsuits filed against them 
and millions in fines levied for knowingly shipping 
packages from illegal online pharmacies, although 
the Department of Justice dismissed its charges 
against FedEx in 2016.
Despite these dangers, online pharmacies 
remain alluring and are one of the fastest growing 
business models, with, oddly, senior citizens—
usually some of the most law-abiding citizens—
leading the charge for cheaper drugs. Typically, 
online pharmacies are located in countries where 
prescription drugs are price-controlled, or where 
the price structure is much lower, such as Canada, 
the United Kingdom, and European countries, as 
well as India and Mexico. U.S. citizens can often 
save 50%–75% by purchasing from online phar-
macies located in other countries. 
Currently, a patchwork regulatory structure 
governs the sale of drugs online. At the federal 
level, the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(FDCA) requires that certain drugs may only be 
purchased with a valid doctor’s prescription and 
must be dispensed by a state-licensed pharmacy. 
To get around this requirement, some online phar-
macies use questionnaires to diagnose disease and 
have these questionnaires reviewed by doctors who 
write the prescription. The Ryan Haight Online 
Pharmacy Consumer Act, which took effect in 
2009, bans the sale of prescription drugs over the 
Internet without a legitimate prescription issued 
by a medical practitioner who has examined the 
patient in person at least once, and requires online 
pharmacies to comply with pharmacy licensing 
laws in every state where they do business, and 
to register with the FDA before beginning to sell 
drugs online. This requirement is virtually unen-
forceable because foreign online pharmacies can 
easily run their websites from an offshore location, 
making it difficult for federal and state authorities 
to exercise jurisdiction over them. For example, 
in 2016, approximately 42% rogue pharmacies 
identified by the FDA have servers located over-
seas, and not even ICANN, the Internet’s central 
administrator, currently has the power to shut 
those sites down.

Another haven for online purveyors of 
illegal drugs is the “Dark” or “Deep” Web, 
which consists of sites that are not accessible 
by search engines and often feature security mea-
sures designed to promote anonymity or to mask 
illegal activity. The most prominent online drug 
marketplace on the Deep Web was the Silk Road, 
which was estimated to attract as much as $45 
million a year in illegal drug purchases and $1.2 
billion worth of total transactions in 2013. The 
Silk Road required users to run Tor anonymity 
software and accepted the virtual currency Bitcoin 
(see the Insight on Society case Bitcoin in Chapter 
5), allowing online drug buyers an unprecedented 
level of protection. The Silk Road was closer to 
eBay than to a pharmacy. But in 2013, the Silk 
Road’s founder and chief operator, Ross Ulbricht, 
was arrested, charged with drug trafficking and 
money laundering, and eventually sentenced to life 
in prison in 2015. Although the arrest was seen as 
a major blow, it it still very easy to purchase illegal 
drugs on the Deep Web. According to researchers 
at Carnegie Mellon University, more than 50% 
of the Deep Web drug marketplaces (which they 
call darknet markets) have websites directly 
derived from the template used by Silk Road. As 
one market is closed, or closes, another pops up 
to take its place; for example,in 2016, Silk Road 
launched its fourth iteration, and although other 
prominent darknet markets like Agora and Evolu-
tion have closed, approximately 50 others have 
emerged to meet user demand. Together, these 
darknet markets account for between $150 and 
$180 million in drug sales each year, more than 
triple the amount Silk Road had in 2013. Mari-
juana accounts for about 33% of sales, followed 
by MDMA, stimulants, psychedelic drugs, prescrip-
tion drugs, and opioids. And though many Bitcoin 
exchanges are forcing users to provide their identi-
ties, law enforcement agencies have not developed 
reliable methods for tracking virtual currencies, as 
criminals have developed methods such as “Bitcoin 
tumbling,” where many users’ Bitcoins are mixed 
together and redistributed to disguise their true 
owners’ identities. 
While law enforcement agencies grapple with 
such sites, traditional illegal pharmacies continue 
to proliferate. The FDA recommends that consum-
ers look for the NABP Verified Internet Pharmacy 
Practice Sites (VIPPS) seal, which verifies that 
the site is legitimate with respect to conformance 
with state laws, and requires a prescription for 
controlled drugs. So far, 48 major Internet phar-
macies have signed on, including Drugstore.com, 
Caremark.com, Walgreens.com, and many other 
U.S. online pharmacies.

Obama signed the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act. The law restricts the sale of 
untaxed cigarettes and other tobacco products over the Internet and bans the delivery 
of tobacco products through the U.S. mail.
Gambling also provides an interesting example of the clash between traditional 
jurisdictional boundaries and claims to a borderless, uncontrollable Web. In the United 
States, gambling of all kinds is largely a matter of state and local laws, but in 2006 
Congress passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA), 
which prohibited financial institutions from transferring funds to or from Internet 
gambling sites, but did not remove from the states the ability to regulate gambling of 
all kinds. While online gambling per se is not prohibited by this act, and no person 
has ever been arrested for online gambling, this legislation essentially crippled the 
online gambling industry within the United States. The online gambling market, based 
almost entirely offshore—primarily in the United Kingdom and various Caribbean 
Islands—grew by leaps and bounds, between 2009 and 2016, with much of the action 
(some estimate up to 50%) coming from customers based in the United States. Online 
gambling is still banned in most of the United States even though the global market 
is now a $45 billion dollar business, almost entirely offshore, and roughly one-third 
the size of the entire U.S. gambling business (about $69 billion, including lotteries 
and public gambling). In the United States, where online gambling is illegal except in 
three states, online gambling generates less than $2 billion in 2016, but is expected 
to grow to $9 billion by 2020. The U.S. Department of Justice enforced the law vigor-
ously, denying offshore operators access to American payment systems, seizing assets, 
crippling their U.S. business, and arresting several executives. However, the mood has 
changed in the last five years. State revenue needs have grown, and many in the casino 
gambling industry have switched sides and now support online gambling, seeing it as 
a revenue growth opportunity. The ethical issues surrounding online gambling may 
have less influence on the public debate than the need for new tax revenues, and for 
firms, the hope for additional revenues.
In 2012, Delaware became the first state to legalize online gambling in all its forms, 
and two others have followed: Nevada and New Jersey. Online gambling is also legal in 
the U.S. Virgin Islands. In 2016, several states are considering bills that would legalize 
online gambling: California, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, and Pennsylvania. 
In 2013, Station Casinos, a local Las Vegas company, opened the nation’s first legal, 
pay-to-play poker website. The site claims it can use geo-location technology to ensure 
that the players are in the State of Nevada and over the age of 21, a condition of its 
operation insofar as the federal government does not yet permit online poker whereas 
it is legal in Nevada and supported by the large casinos as an extension of their brands. 
However, so far, legal online gambling has disappointed expectations. While 
online gambling sputters along in a slow-growth economy, fantasy sports and betting 
is exploding. Two firms dominate the online fantasy sports market: DraftKings and 
FanDuel. Both firms advertise heavily during college and professional sports games. 
In fantasy sports, players assemble their ideal fantasy teams, drafting real-life athletes 
to their team, and then, based on the performance of those players in real games, they 
can win significant prizes. The most popular sports are college football and basketball, 
and professional football and baseball. Players are given a budget that they can use 
to draft players, and some of the combined fees for each game make up the pool for

which players compete. Entry fees range widely from less than a dollar, to over $1,000 
(Belson, 2015). DraftKings claims that several winner prizes have exceeded $1 million 
although none of the sites publish a list of winners. 
Fantasy sports games are permitted in 45 states. Fantasy sports were exempted 
from the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA) under indus-
try pressure from the then much smaller fantasy sports business. The industry argued 
that fantasy sports are not gambling, but instead games of skill like chess or Scrabble. 
As the industry has grown to billion-dollar venture capital valuations, however, and 
with allegations of cheating customers, deceptive practices, lack of transparency, and 
insider irregularities, state and federal legislators are holding hearings and consider-
ing regulations (Russo, 2015; Drape and Williams, 2015). In November 2015, New York 
State attorney general Eric Schneiderman told both DraftKings and FanDuel to stop 
taking entries from New York State residents because, in the state’s opinion, their 
operations constitute illegal gambling. After lengthy legislative hearings, and strong 
support from sports fans, New York reversed its position, arguing that when played 
fairly, fantasy sports gambling was a game of skill, not gambling, and legalized the 
practice while imposing a regulatory regime on the industry to ensure its fair opera-
tion (Drape, 2016).

Searching for a Safe Haven
T
he Pirate Bay (TPB) has been one of the world’s best-known and most 
popular pirated music and content sites for over a decade, offering free 
access to millions of copyrighted songs and thousands of copyrighted 
Hollywood movies, television shows, and video games. This despite 
the fact that TPB has been subjected to repeated legal efforts to shut it down. In fact, 
the authorities pursuing TPB must feel as if they are engaged in a never-ending game 
of Whack-a-mole, as each time they “whack” TPB, it somehow manages to reappear. 
But the battle is far from over, and for the first time, it appears possible that the “good 
guys” are actually winning. The Internet is becoming a tough place for music and video 
pirates to make a living in part because of enforcement actions, but more importantly 
because of new mobile and wireless technologies that enable high-quality content to 
be streamed for just a small fee.
TPB is part of a European social and political movement that opposes copyrighted 
content and demands that music, videos, TV shows, and other digital content be free

and unrestricted. TPB does not operate a database of copyrighted content. Neither does 
it operate a network of computers owned by “members” who store the content, nor 
does it create, own, or distribute software (like BitTorrent and most other so-called P2P 
networks) that permits such networks to exist in the first place. Instead, TPB simply 
provides a search engine that generates a list of search results from P2P networks 
around the world where the titles can be found. By clicking on a selected link, users 
gain access to the copyrighted content, but only after downloading software and other 
files from that P2P network.
TPB claims it is merely a search engine providing pointers to existing P2P net-
works that it does not itself control. It says that it cannot control what content users 
ultimately find on those P2P networks, and that it is no different from any other search 
engine, such as Google or Bing, which are not held responsible for the content found 
on sites listed in search results. From a broader standpoint, TPB’s founders also claim 
that copyright laws in general unjustly interfere with the free flow of information on 
the Internet, and that in any event, they were not violating Swedish copyright law, 
which they felt should be the only law that applied. And they further claimed they 
did not encourage, incite, or enable illegal downloading. Nevertheless, the defendants 
have never denied that theirs was a commercial enterprise. Despite all the talk calling 
for the free, unfettered spread of culture, TPB was a money-making operation from 
the beginning, designed to produce profits for its founders, with advertising as the 
primary source of revenue.
However, the First Swedish Court in Stockholm declared TPB’s four founders 
guilty of violating Swedish copyright law, and sentenced each to one year in prison 
and payment of $3.5 million in restitution to the plaintiffs, all Swedish divisions of 
the major record firms (Warner Music, Sony, and EMI Group among them). The court 
found that the defendants had incited copyright infringement by providing a website 
with search functions, easy uploading and storage possibilities, and a tracker. The 
court also said that the four defendants had been aware of the fact that copyrighted 
material was shared with the help of their site and that the defendants were engaged 
in a commercial enterprise, the basis of which was encouraging visitors to violate the 
copyrights of owners. In fact, the primary purpose of TPB was to violate copyrights 
in order to make money for the owners (commercial intent).
Meanwhile, the U.S. government pressured the Swedish government to strengthen 
its copyright laws to discourage rampant downloading. In Sweden, downloading music 
and videos from illegal sites was very popular, engaged in by 43% of the Swedish Inter-
net population. To strengthen its laws, Sweden adopted the European Union conven-
tion on copyrights, which allows content owners to receive from Internet providers the 
names and addresses of people suspected of sharing pirated files. In France, partici-
pating in these pirate sites will result in banishment from the Internet for up to three 
years. As a result, Internet traffic in Sweden declined by 40%, and has stayed there.
TPB appealed the court judgment and has not paid any fines. That doesn’t mean 
that TPB has not been affected by the lawsuits, however. In 2011, the firm moved its 
servers into caves in Sweden, and dispersed multiple copies of its program to other 
countries. In response to the lawsuits, police raids, and confiscation of servers, TPB

has had stints in France, Finland, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, the U.K., and 
Greece within the last few years. These countries have in some cases refused to allow 
Internet service providers in their countries to host or link to TPB, no matter where in 
the world its servers are located. Authorities have shut down TPB’s top-level domains 
in Sweden, Greenland, and Iceland, but TPB has continued to operate by hopping from 
country to country, moving to Sint Maarten, to tiny Ascension Island, to Peru, and 
back again to Sweden. In 2014, co-founder Gottfrid Svartholm Warg began serving a 
42-month term in prison in Denmark for both copyright infringement and computer 
crimes unrelated to TPB, co-founder Peter Sunde was arrested after years on the run, 
and served a five-month prison term for copyright violation, and Fredrik Neij, another 
co-founder, was arrested in Thailand, then transferred to Swedish custody to serve a 
10-month prison sentence. The company’s financial resources also began to run dry. 
As interest continued to accrue on financial penalties previously levied on TPB, Carl 
Lundstrom, the site’s primary financial backer, declared bankruptcy. 
In December 2014, police again raided the site and shut it down. The site remained 
offline for seven weeks, until January 2015, the longest period of time it had ever been 
shut down. Members of the hacker group Anonymous claimed it was now in fact an 
FBI honeypot designed to trap the unwary. Even if rumors about the FBI are not true, 
many believe that it is not a good idea to use TPB anymore for other reasons: the site 
is now riddled with ads containing malware, contains downloadable malware and 
ransomware masquerading as popular movies and TV programs, and frequently goes 
offline. Even one of its original co-founders, Peter Sunde, has recommended that the 
site shut down once and for all. Nevertheless, the site continues to prove as elusive 
as ever for law enforcement, using a distributed approach to minimize the impact 
of closures in any individual country in which it operates. In 2016, a Swedish court 
ruled that the state could confiscate its top-level Swedish domains. In response, the 
company moved back to its original .org domain from 2003, which puts it back within 
the crosshairs of the United States.
In 2016, several lesser file sharing sites have voluntarily ceased operations, citing 
falling traffic and revenues and legal concerns. Although TPB recorded increases in 
site traffic after each of the closures, it’s not a good sign for piracy sites in general. 
Nonetheless, TPB seems to have resilience that other sites lack, celebrating its 13th 
anniversary in 2016. TPB returned to the top spot among sites of its kind in 2016 after 
a multi-year hiatus due to its leadership upheaval and frequent closures. TPB has also 
become the largest video streaming site in the world thanks to a plugin that allows 
users to stream pirated content directly from their browsers. In typical Pirate Bay 
fashion, the plug-in behaves suspiciously like malware and is replete with bugs, but for 
users who are dead set against paying for content, the arrival of streaming to TPB has 
been a welcome addition. Those users also had to overcome many popular browsers, 
including Chrome and Firefox, blocking The Pirate Bay as malware. 
The record industry’s struggle against TPB is just part of the battle that it has 
been waging for some time. In 2005, the Supreme Court ruled in the ground-breaking 
Metro-Goldwyn Mayer v. Grokster, et al. case that the original peer-to-peer file sharing 
services, such as Grokster, Kazaa, and StreamCast, could be held liable for copyright

infringement, because they had intentionally sought to encourage users to share 
copyrighted material. All of these services have since gone out of business. But these 
legal victories, and stronger government enforcement of copyright laws, have not 
proven to be the magic bullet that miraculously solves all the problems facing the 
music industry. The music industry has had to drastically change its business model 
and decisively move toward streaming digital distribution platforms. They have made 
striking progress, and sales of music in a purely digital format now account for more 
revenue than sales of music in a physical format. To accomplish this, the music indus-
try has employed a number of different business models and online delivery platforms, 
including Apple’s iTunes pay-per-download model, subscription models, and cloud-
based streaming models.
In each of these new media delivery platforms, the copyright owners—record 
companies, artists, and Hollywood studios—have struck licensing deals with the tech-
nology platform owners and distributors (Apple, Amazon, and Google). These new 
platforms offer a win-win solution. Consumers benefit by having near instant access 
to high-quality music tracks and videos without the hassle of P2P software downloads. 
Content owners get a growing revenue stream and protection for their copyrighted 
content. And the pirates? TPB and other pirate sites may not be able to compete with 
new and better ways to listen to music and view videos. In 2015, traffic from the 
Pirate Bay and its cohorts accounted for 2.76% of Internet traffic during peak hours, 
compared to 36.48% from Netflix alone. And content pirates don’t appear to be par-
ticularly loyal to any of the sites they use; for all its traffic, TPB gets an average of 
only $9 per day in bitcoin donations in 2016, and even that paltry sum still dwarfs the 
amounts its competitors receive. Like the real pirates of the Caribbean, who are now 
just a footnote in history books, technology and consumer preference for ease of use 
may leave them behind.

REVIEW
K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Understand why e-commerce raises ethical, social, and political issues.
•	
Internet technology and its use in e-commerce disrupts existing social and business relationships and 
understandings. Suddenly, individuals, business firms, and political institutions are confronted by new 
possibilities of behavior for which understandings, laws, and rules of acceptable behavior have not yet 
been developed. Many business firms and individuals are benefiting from the commercial development 
of the Internet, but this development also has costs for individuals, organizations, and societies. These 
costs and benefits must be carefully considered by those seeking to make ethical and socially responsible 
decisions in this new environment, particularly where there are as yet no clear-cut legal or cultural 
guidelines.
•	
The major issues raised by e-commerce can be loosely categorized into four major dimensions:
•	
Information rights—What rights do individuals have to control their own personal information when 
Internet technologies make information collection so pervasive and efficient?
•	
Property rights—How can traditional intellectual property rights be enforced when perfect copies of 
protected works can be made and easily distributed worldwide via the Internet?
•	
Governance—Should the Internet and e-commerce be subject to public laws? If so, what law-making 
bodies have jurisdiction—state, federal, and/or international?
•	
Public safety and welfare—What efforts should be undertaken to ensure equitable access to the Inter-
net and e-commerce channels? Do certain online content and activities pose a threat to public safety 
and welfare?
•	
Ethical, social, and political controversies usually present themselves as dilemmas. Ethical dilemmas can 
be analyzed via the following process:
•	
Identify and clearly describe the facts.
•	
Define the conflict or dilemma and identify the higher-order values involved.
•	
Identify the stakeholders.
•	
Identify the options that you can reasonably take.
•	
Identify the potential consequences of your options.
•	
Refer to well-established ethical principles, such as the Golden Rule, Universalism, the Slippery 
Slope, the Collective Utilitarian Principle, Risk Aversion, the No Free Lunch Rule, the New York 
Times Test, and the Social Contract Rule to help you decide the matter.
Understand basic concepts related to privacy and information rights, the practices of e-commerce companies that 
threaten privacy, and the different methods that can be used to protect online privacy.
•	
To understand the issues concerning online privacy, you must first understand some basic concepts:
•	
Privacy is the moral right of individuals to be left alone, free from surveillance or interference from 
others.
•	
Information privacy includes the right to control personal information, to know what is being col-
lected, the right to due process, and to right to have personal information stored securely. 
•	
Due process as embodied by the Fair Information Practices doctrine, informed consent, and opt-in/
opt-out policies also plays an important role in privacy.
•	
Concepts of privacy are different in the public versus the private sector. In the public sector, privacy is 
protected by founding documents. In the private sector, privacy is less well defined, and only emerging.
•	
Almost all e-commerce companies collect some personally identifiable information in addition to anony-
mous information and use cookies to track clickstream behavior of visitors. Advertising networks and

C H A P T E R  8     E t h i c a l ,  S o c i a l ,  a n d  P o l i t i c a l  I s s u e s  i n  E - c o m m e r c e
search engines also track the behavior of consumers across thousands of popular sites, not just at one 
site, via cookies, spyware, search engine behavioral targeting, and other techniques.
•	
There are a number of different methods used to protect online privacy. They include:
•	
Legal protections deriving from constitutions, common law, federal law, state laws, and government 
regulations. In the United States, rights to online privacy may be derived from the U.S. Constitution, 
tort law, federal laws such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the FTC’s Fair 
Information Practice principles, the FCC’s broadband ISP privacy regulations, and a variety of state 
laws. In Europe, the European Commission’s Data Protection Directive and GDPR (Privacy Shield) 
has standardized and broadened privacy protection in the European Union nations.
•	
Industry self-regulation via industry alliances, such as the Online Privacy Alliance and the Network 
Advertising Initiative, that seek to gain voluntary adherence to industry privacy guidelines and safe 
harbors. Some firms also hire chief privacy officers.
•	
Privacy-enhancing technological solutions include spyware and pop-up blockers, secure e-mail, 
anonymous remailers, anonymous surfing, cookie managers, disk file-erasing programs, policy gen-
erators, and public key encryption programs.
Understand the various forms of intellectual property and the challenges involved in protecting it.
•	
Copyright law protects original forms of expression such as writings, drawings, and computer programs 
from being copied by others for a minimum of 70 years. It does not protect ideas—just their expression in 
a tangible medium. Copyrights, like all rights, are not absolute. The doctrine of fair use permits certain 
parties under certain circumstances to use copyrighted material without permission. The Digital Millen-
nium Copyright Act (DMCA) was the first major effort to adjust copyright law to the Internet age. The 
DMCA implements a World Intellectual Property Organization treaty, which declares it illegal to make, 
distribute, or use devices that circumvent technology-based protections of copyrighted materials, and 
attaches stiff fines and prison sentences for violations.
•	
Patent law grants the owner of a patent an exclusive monopoly to the ideas behind an invention for 20 
years. Patents are very different from copyrights in that they protect the ideas themselves and not merely 
the expression of ideas. There are four types of inventions for which patents are granted under patent 
law: machines, man-made products, compositions of matter, and processing methods. In order to be 
granted a patent, the applicant must show that the invention is new, original, novel, nonobvious, and not 
evident in prior arts and practice. Most of the inventions that make the Internet and e-commerce possible 
were not patented by their inventors. This changed in the mid-1990s with the commercial development 
of the Web. Business firms began applying for “business methods” and software patents.
•	
Trademark protections exist at both the federal and state levels in the United States. Trademark law pro-
tects the public in the marketplace by ensuring that it gets what it pays for and wants to receive and also 
protects the owner who has spent time, money, and energy bringing the product to market against piracy 
and misappropriation. Federal trademarks are obtained, first, by use in interstate commerce, and second, 
by registration with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Trademarks are granted for a period 
of 10 years and can be renewed indefinitely. Use of a trademark that creates confusion with existing 
trademarks, causes consumers to make market mistakes, or misrepresents the origins of goods is an 
infringement. In addition, the intentional misuse of words and symbols in the marketplace to extort rev-
enue from legitimate trademark owners (“bad faith”) is proscribed. The Anticybersquatting Consumer 
Protection Act (ACPA) creates civil liabilities for anyone who attempts in bad faith to profit from an exist-
ing famous or distinctive trademark by registering an Internet domain name that is identical or confus-
ingly similar to, or “dilutive” of, that trademark. The major behaviors on the Internet that have run afoul 
of trademark law include cybersquatting, cyberpiracy, metatagging, keywording, linking, and framing.
•	
Trade secret laws protect intellectual property having to do with business procedures, processes, formulas, 
and methods of manufacture.

Understand how the Internet is governed and why taxation of e-commerce raises governance and jurisdiction issues.
•	
Governance has to do with social control: who will control e-commerce, what elements will be controlled, 
and how will those controls be implemented. We are currently in a mixed-mode policy environment 
where self-regulation, through a variety of Internet policy and technical bodies, co-exists with limited 
government regulation.
•	
E-commerce raises the issue of how—and if—to tax remote sales. The national and international charac-
ter of Internet sales has wreaked havoc on taxation schemes in the United States that were built in the 
1930s and based on local commerce and local jurisdictions. E-commerce has benefited from a tax subsidy 
since its inception. E-commerce merchants have argued that this new form of commerce needs to be 
nurtured and encouraged, and that in any event, the crazy quilt of sales and use tax regimes would be 
difficult to administer for Internet merchants. In 1998, Congress passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act, 
which placed a moratorium on multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce, and any taxa-
tion of Internet access, and since that time has extended the moratorium several times, and in 2016 made 
it permanent. Federal legislation to implement a uniform set of rules for collecting taxes on e-commerce 
sales is currently pending in Congress. Net neutrality refers to the idea that Internet service providers 
(ISPs), including cable Internet and wireless carriers, should treat all data on the Internet in the same 
manner, and not discriminate or price differentially by content, protocol, platform, hardware, or 
application.
Identify major public safety and welfare issues raised by e-commerce.
•	
Critical public safety and welfare issues in e-commerce include:
•	
The protection of children and strong sentiments against pornography. Several attempts by Congress 
to legislate in this area have been struck down as unconstitutional. The Children’s Internet Protec-
tion Act (CIPA), which requires schools and libraries in the United States to install “technology pro-
tection measures” (filtering software) in an effort to shield children from pornography, has, however, 
been upheld by the Supreme Court.
•	
Efforts to control gambling and restrict sales of cigarettes and drugs. In the United States, cigarettes, 
gambling, medical drugs, and addictive recreational drugs are either banned or tightly regulated by 
federal and state laws. Many offshore sites for these products and services have been shut down 
following government pressure. Online gambling is growing, but slower than anticipated. Online 
fantasy sports betting is growing rapidly.

	19.	 What is the “right to be forgotten”? What are some of the risks and benefits of establishing this right?
	20.	 What is the doctrine of “fair use”? Why did the courts decide that Google’s scanning of copyrighted books 
was a “fair use”?
P R O J E C T S
	 1.	 Go to Google and find the Advanced Search link. Examine its SafeSearch filtering options. Surf the Web 
in search of content that could be considered objectionable for children using each of the options. What 
are the pros and cons of such restrictions? Are there terms that could be considered inappropriate to the 
filtering software but be approved by parents? Name five questionable terms. Prepare a brief presenta-
tion to report on your experiences and to explain the positive and negative aspects of such filtering 
software.
	 2.	 Develop a list of privacy protection features that should be present if a website is serious about 
protecting privacy. Then, visit at least four well-known websites and examine their privacy policies. 
Write a report that rates each of the websites on the criteria you have developed.
	 3.	 Review the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. Examine each of the major 
sections of the legislation and make a list of the protections afforded property owners and users of 
copyrighted materials. Do you believe this legislation balances the interests of owners and users appro-
priately? Do you have suggestions for strengthening “fair use” provisions in this legislation?
	 4.	 Visit at least four websites that take a position on e-commerce taxation, beginning with the National 
Conference of State Legislatures (Ncsl.org) and the National Governors Association (Nga.org). You might 
also include national associations of local businesses or citizen groups opposed to e-commerce taxation. 
Develop a reasoned argument for, or against, taxation of e-commerce.

Blue Nile Sparkles
for Your Cleopatra 
L
ooking for that special gift for your 
Cleopatra but don’t want to spend 
a lot of time shopping? Want to give 
the “Big Rock” without spending a mountain of 
cash for the engagement experience? Not sure 
about the future value of diamonds? Then how 
about pearls, gold, or platinum? 
Your answer has arrived: BlueNile offers you 
an online selection of almost 230,000 diamonds 
for that special someone. You can buy them cut 
and polished or put them into settings like rings, 
bracelets, earrings, necklaces, pendants, watches, 
and brooches that you choose online. All the dia-
monds are graded by the 4 C’s: carats (size), cut, 
color, and clarity, and a report for each diamond prepared by the Gemological Institute 
of America is available online. To make it easier, the carats are translated into milligrams, 
and one carat is exactly 200 milligrams of mass (if that helps).  
BlueNile.com started out as RockShop.com in March 1999 in Seattle, Washington. 
In November 1999, the company launched the Blue Nile brand and changed its name to 
Blue Nile Inc., opening up its website, BlueNile.com, in December 1999. In 2004, it went 
public. In 2007, Blue Nile sold the most expensive item in Internet history at the time, a 
$1.5 million single diamond of around 10 carats, a size that would cover your finger with 
a penny-size rock. In 2015, another diamond sold for $1.8 million. 
Back in the early days of e-commerce, no one ever thought that the Internet would be a 
place where fine jewelry was sold. Typically, gifts of jewelry such as diamonds are associated 
with a significant emotional event, such as an engagement, marriage, or anniversary. Shopping 
online hardly matches the emotional impact of walking into Tiffany’s or another established 
retail store, with clear glass cases filled with brilliantly shining baubles, attended by a small 
army of sales clerks that make you feel like royalty. Diamonds represent a significant cost, 
and there is significant uncertainty about their value and pricing. Surveys show that most 
shoppers believe jewelry is highly overpriced, but they lack the knowledge and information 
to negotiate a better price or even to judge the quality of what they are buying. Most experts 
thought that few consumers would feel comfortable going to a strange website and plunk-
ing down $5,000 or more for a diamond they could not see or touch for several days. But 
as it turns out, the retail jewelry industry is an ideal candidate for web sales. Here’s why. 
The $70 billion fine jewelry industry in the United States is a byzantine, fragmented 
collection of about 21,500 specialty jewelry stores and another 100,000-plus that sell

C H A P T E R  9     O n l i n e  R e t a i l  a n d  S e r v i c e s 
jewelry along with other products. Diamond jewelry and loose diamonds together consti-
tute more than 50% of retailers’ sales. To supply this fragmented market, several layers 
of wholesalers and middlemen intervene, from rough diamond brokers to diamond cutters, 
diamond wholesalers, jewelry manufacturers, jewelry wholesalers, and finally, regional 
distributors. Oddly, the source of raw mined diamonds is monopolized by a single company, 
De Beers, which controls around half of the world market. The fragmented supply and 
distribution chains add to huge markups based on monopoly-set prices for raw diamonds. 
Currently, the typical retail store markup for diamonds is between 50% and 100%. Blue 
Nile’s markup is around 30%.
Blue Nile’s 2015 revenues were about $480 million, up slightly from $473.5 million 
in 2014. International sales (in more than 40 countries worldwide) stayed mostly stag-
nant as well, rising to about $82 million in 2015 from $81 million in 2014. As Blue Nile 
continues to grow into new regions, including the lucrative China market, it expects its 
revenues to hold mostly steady in 2016. However, Blue Nile’s net sales and net income 
declined slightly from 2015 levels in the first half of 2016, as sales of big-ticket items 
flagged in the wake of volatility in stock markets worldwide. 
Blue Nile’s online competitors include Tiffany, Ice, and even Amazon. Together, these 
companies are transforming the jewelry business. Blue Nile, for instance, has simplified the 
supply side of diamonds by cutting out several layers of middlemen and instead dealing 
directly with wholesale diamond owners and jewelry manufacturers. Blue Nile also mini-
mizes its inventory costs and limits its risk of inventory markdowns. On the sell side of 
distribution, Blue Nile has eliminated the expensive stores, sales clerks, and beautiful, 
but expensive, glass cases. Instead, Blue Nile offers a website at which it can aggregate 
the demand of thousands of unique visitors for diamonds and present them with a more 
attractive shopping experience than a typical retail store. The result of rationalizing the 
supply and distribution chain is much lower markups. For example, Blue Nile will purchase 
a pair of oval emerald and diamond earrings from a supplier for $850 and charge the 
consumer $1,020. A traditional retailer would charge the consumer $1,258. 
Blue Nile has improved the shopping experience primarily by creating a trust- and 
knowledge-based environment that reduces consumer anxiety about the value of diamonds. 
Blue Nile’s website contains educational guides to diamonds and diamond grading systems, 
and each diamond receives an independent quality rating from a nonprofit industry associa-
tion. There’s a 30-day, money-back, no-questions-asked guarantee. The average customer 
visits the website repeatedly over several weeks, views at least 200 pages, and typically 
calls Blue Nile’s live customer service line at least once. In 2016, Blue Nile earned the 
highest possible customer service rating from a prominent consumer review site.
In 2009, Blue Nile rebuilt its website, strengthening its appeal to its mostly male 
customer base while attempting to draw more women to the site. In 2010, it introduced 
a mobile website and iPhone/iPad app. The iPhone app provides users with a quick way 
to set specifications for a diamond and see the price as well as a Call button that provides 
a direct link to the Blue Nile call center for phone orders. Blue Nile’s mobile revenues 
continue to grow, reaching $42 million in 2014, more than quadruple the amount in 2012. 
Blue Nile has also dived into social media marketing, with a Facebook page that has over 
3.8 million Likes, a YouTube channel with 2.5 million views, a Pinterest page with over

90,000 followers, an Instagram feed with almost 80,000 followers, and a Twitter feed 
with over 16,000 followers. Users attracted to an image of jewelry posted on these sites 
can click links that take them directly to a purchase page for the item. 
In 2012, Blue Nile began a shift in its strategy driven by the possibility that online 
retailers will have to begin collecting Internet sales taxes in most jurisdictions (see the 
Insight on Business case, Internet Sales Tax Battle, in Chapter 8). The company is moving 
toward fashion jewelry and higher price points and away from simply offering the lowest 
prices. Blue Nile has begun offering a proprietary line of high-end jewelry, and has added 
a design director and a new chief merchant to retool its product offerings. Still, even with 
additional sales taxes, Blue Nile’s Internet-based distribution methods and lack of overhead 
from physical stores will allow them to continue to offer competitive prices. However, Blue 
Nile has taken steps to avoid remitting taxes in some areas, including ceasing shipments 
to customers in South Dakota in response to the state’s online sales tax collection laws 
that went into effect in 2016.
In 2013, Blue Nile announced a partnership with Nordstrom that allows prospective 
customers to see rings before they buy them online. Rings in the Nordstrom outlets are 
for display only, but Nordstrom jewelry experts can use iPads to help customers purchase 
rings that appeal to them from the Blue Nile site while in the store. The response was 
very positive. Buoyed by this success, Blue Nile opened its first physical store, which it 
calls a webroom, in 2015 in Long Island, New York. The webroom allows customers to 
see and try on products before actually purchasing them online. The webrooms are small 
(about 400 square feet) and lack any capability for in-store sales, with customers still 
making any actual purchases online. This allows Blue Nile to offer many of the services 
that bricks-and-mortar jewelers can provide without forcing them to raise their prices 
to account for inventory management and a large sales force. The webrooms also have 
a digital wall that displays Blue Nile’s social media activity, a feature clearly designed 
to appeal to Millennials. In 2016, after experiencing significant upticks in online sales 
in the region around its first webroom, Blue Nile is  expanding its webroom initiative. 
The company opened a second storefront in New York and is continuing to add locations 
throughout the country, including in Washington, D.C., and Portland, Oregon. According 
to Blue Nile, its initial webrooms have generated strong conversion rates and increased 
online traffic in their respective areas. Blue Nile leadership foresees establishing as many 
as 50 webroom locations in the near future. Blue Nile is part of a larger trend that has 
seen many top online brands begin to open bricks-and-mortar storefronts with the intent 
of improving brand awareness and generating additional online traffic. Blue Nile custom-
ers’ chief complaint is the inability to see and touch the products, and physical storefronts 
are a great way to meet that need while also driving profits.
So far, the “Blue Nile” effect of lower margins and Internet efficiency has mainly 
impacted the small mom-and-pop jewelry stores. Many small retailers have disappeared 
in the last few years due to rising diamond prices and pressure from larger companies. The 
big retailers, such as Tiffany, Zales, and others, sell more than Blue Nile, and continue to 
benefit from consumer interest in diamond engagement and wedding rings. Blue Nile has 
grown more in the past three years than its closest online-only jewelry competitors, but 
the company will still have to keep a keen watch on its competitors to keep its edge online.

T
he Blue Nile case illustrates some of the advantages that an online retail 
company has over traditional offline retailers—and some of the disad-
vantages. An online company can radically simplify the existing industry 
supply chain and develop an entirely new web-based distribution system that is far 
more efficient than traditional retail outlets. At the same time, an online retailer can 
create a better value proposition for the customer, improving customer service and 
satisfaction in the process. On the other hand, online companies often have razor-
thin profit margins, lack a physical store network to bolster sales to the non-Internet 
audience, and are sometimes based on unproven business assumptions that, in the 
long term, may not pan out. In contrast, large offline retailers such as Walmart, JCPen-
ney, Sears, and Target have established brand names, a huge real estate investment, 
a loyal customer base, and extraordinarily efficient inventory control and fulfillment 
systems. As we shall see in this chapter, traditional offline catalog merchants are also 
advantaged. We will also see that, in order to leverage their assets and core competen-
cies, established offline retailers need to cultivate new competencies and a carefully 
developed business plan to succeed online. 
As with retail goods, the promise of online service providers is that they can deliver 
superior-quality service and greater convenience to millions of consumers at a lower 
cost than established bricks-and-mortar service providers and still make a respectable 
return on invested capital. The service sector is one of the most natural avenues for 
e-commerce because so much of the value in services is based on collecting, storing, 
and exchanging information—something for which the Web is ideally suited. And, 
in fact, online services have been extraordinarily successful in attracting banking, 
brokerage, travel, and job-hunting customers. The quality and amount of informa-
tion online to support consumer decisions in finance, travel, and career placement is 
extraordinary, especially when compared to what was available to consumers before 
e-commerce. The online service sector—like online retail—has established a significant 
beachhead and now plays a large role in consumer time on the Internet. In areas such 
as brokerage, banking, and travel, online services are an extraordinary success story 
and have transformed their industries. In Sections 9.5–9.7 of this chapter, we take a 
close look at three of the most successful online services: financial services (includ-
ing insurance and real estate), travel services, and career services. In Section 9.8, we 
examine the new on-demand services companies, such as Uber, Airbnb, and a whole 
host of others, that have rocketed to prominence in the last several years. Using a 
business model that is both local and mobile, this new type of service company pro-
vides a platform for consumers to connect with providers who can provide on-demand 
services, such as transportation, short-term room rental, grocery shopping, and more.

THE ONLINE RETAIL SECTOR 
Table 9.1 summarizes some of these leading trends in online retailing for 2016–2017.
Perhaps the most important theme in online retailing is the effort by retailers—both

offline and online—to integrate their operations so they can serve customers in the 
various ways they want to be served.
By any measure, the size of the U.S. retail market is huge. In an $18.5 trillion 
economy, personal consumption of retail goods and services accounts for about $12.7 
trillion (about 69%) of the total gross domestic product (GDP) (Bureau of Economic 
Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce, 2016).
THE RETAIL INDUSTRY
The retail industry is composed of many different types of firms. Figure 9.1 illustrates 
the major segments: durable goods, general merchandise, food and beverage, specialty 
stores, gasoline and fuel, mail order/telephone order (MOTO), and online retail firms. 
Each of these segments offers opportunities for online retail, and yet in each segment, 
	
TABLE 9.1	
WHAT’S NEW IN ONLINE RETAIL 2016–2017
•	 Retail mobile e-commerce is exploding, increasing from around $81 billion In 2015 to an expected 
$116 billion in 2016.
•	 Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram, together with online retailers, 
continue to try to understand how best to facilitate social e-commerce, with the introduction of Buy 
buttons on Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest.
•	 Local e-commerce, headlined by new local on-demand service companies such as Uber, skyrockets to 
over $40 billion.
•	 The number of online buyers continues to increase, to over 175 million in 2016, and the average 
annual purchase also continues to increase, up by over 11% in 2016 to $2,255.
•	 Online retailers remain generally profitable by focusing on revenue growth, increasing the size of 
average purchase amounts, and improving efficiency of operations. 
•	 Online retail remains the fastest growing retail channel.
•	 Buying online has become a normal, mainstream, everyday experience. Almost 90% of Internet users 
in the United States are now online shoppers.
•	 The selection of goods for purchase online continues to increase to include luxury goods, such as 
jewelry, gourmet groceries, furniture, and wine, as customer trust and experience increase. 
•	 Informational shopping for big-ticket items such as cars and appliances continues to expand rapidly 
to include nearly all retail goods (both durables and non-durables).
•	 Specialty retail sites show rapid growth in online retail as they develop customized retail goods and 
customer online configuration of goods.
•	 Online retailers place an increased emphasis on providing an improved “shopping experience,” 
including ease of navigation and use, online inventory updates, interactive tools, customer feedback 
and ratings, and social shopping opportunities. 
•	 Online retailers increase the use of interactive marketing technologies and techniques such as blogs, 
user-generated content, and video that exploit the dominance of broadband connections and offer 
features such as zoom, color switch, product configuration, and virtual simulations of households 
and businesses.
•	 Retailers are increasingly becoming omni-channel retailers, integrating the multiple retail channels 
provided by physical stores, the Web, and the mobile platform.
•	 New virtual merchants such as Birchbox, Naturebox, and others emerge that are using a new 
subscription-based revenue model for retail.
•	 Big data and powerful analytic programs begin to be used for predictive marketing by both large and 
small retailers.

the uses of the Internet may differ. Some eating and drinking establishments use the 
Web and mobile apps to inform people of their physical locations and menus, while 
others offer delivery via online orders. Retailers of durable goods typically use the 
online channel primarily as an informational tool rather than as a direct purchasing 
tool, although this has begun to change.
The MOTO sector is the most similar to the online retail sales sector. In the 
absence of physical stores, MOTO retailers distribute millions of physical catalogs 
(their largest expense) and operate large telephone call centers to accept orders. 
They have developed extraordinarily efficient order fulfillment centers that gener-
ally ship customer orders within 24 hours of receipt. MOTO was the fastest growing 
retail segment throughout the 1970s and 1980s. It grew as a direct result of improve-
ments in the national toll-free call system, the implementation of digital switching in 
telephone systems, falling long distance telecommunications prices, and of course, 
the expansion of the credit card industry and associated technologies, without which 
neither MOTO nor e-commerce would be possible on a large national scale. MOTO 
was the last “technological” retailing revolution that preceded e-commerce. Because 
of their experience in fulfilling small orders rapidly, the transition to e-commerce was 
not difficult for these firms. 
ONLINE RETAILING
Online retail is perhaps the most high-profile e-commerce sector. Over the past decade, 
this sector has experienced both explosive growth and spectacular failures. Many of 
the early pure-play online-only firms that pioneered the retail marketspace failed. 
Entrepreneurs and their investors seriously misjudged the factors needed to succeed 
in this market. But the survivors of this early period emerged much stronger, and along

COMPOSITION OF THE U.S. RETAIL INDUSTRY 
The retail industry can be grouped into seven major segments.

with traditional offline general and specialty merchants, as well as new startups, the 
e-tail space is growing very rapidly and is increasing its reach and size.
E-commerce Retail: The Vision
In the early years of e-commerce, literally thousands of entrepreneurial web-based 
retailers were drawn to the marketplace for retail goods, simply because it was one of 
the largest market opportunities in the U.S. economy. Many entrepreneurs initially 
believed it was easy to enter the retail market. Early writers predicted that the retail 
industry would be revolutionized, literally “blown to bits”—as prophesied by two con-
sultants in a famous Harvard Business School book (Evans and Wurster, 2000). The 
basis of this revolution would be fourfold. First, because the Internet greatly reduced 
both search costs and transaction costs, consumers would use the Web to find the 
lowest-cost products. Several results would follow. Consumers would increasingly 
drift to the Web for shopping and purchasing, and only low-cost, high-service, quality 
online retail merchants would survive. Economists assumed that the online consumer 
was rational and cost-driven—not driven by perceived value or brand, both of which 
are nonrational factors.
Second, it was assumed that the entry costs to the online retail market were much 
less than those needed to establish physical storefronts, and that online merchants 
were inherently more efficient at marketing and order fulfillment than offline stores. 
The costs of establishing a powerful website were thought to be minuscule compared 
to the costs of warehouses, fulfillment centers, and physical stores. There would be no 
difficulty building sophisticated order entry, shopping cart, and fulfillment systems 
because this technology was well known, and the cost of technology was falling by 50% 
each year. Even the cost of acquiring consumers was thought to be much lower because 
of search engines that could almost instantly connect customers to online vendors.
Third, as prices fell, traditional offline physical store merchants would be forced 
out of business. New entrepreneurial companies—such as Amazon—would replace 
the traditional stores. It was thought that if online merchants grew very quickly, they 
would have first-mover advantages and lock out the older traditional firms that were 
too slow to enter the online market.
Fourth, in some industries—such as electronics, apparel, and digital content—the 
market would be disintermediated as manufacturers or their distributors entered to 
build a direct relationship with the consumer, destroying the retail intermediaries or 
middlemen. In this scenario, traditional retail channels—such as physical stores, sales 
clerks, and sales forces—would be replaced by a single dominant channel: the Web.
Many predicted, on the other hand, a kind of hypermediation based on the concept 
of a virtual firm in which online retailers would gain advantage over established offline 
merchants by building an online brand name that attracted millions of customers, and 
outsourcing the expensive warehousing and order fulfillment functions—the original 
concept of Amazon.
As it turned out, few of these assumptions and visions were correct, and the struc-
ture of the retail marketplace in the United States, with some notable exceptions, has 
not been blown to bits, disintermediated, or revolutionized in the traditional meaning 
of the word “revolution.” With several notable exceptions, online retail has often not 

590	
	
C H A P T E R  9     O n l i n e  R e t a i l  a n d  S e r v i c e s 
been successful as an independent platform on which to build a successful “pure-play” 
online-only business. As it turns out, the consumer is not primarily price-driven when 
shopping on the Internet but instead considers brand name, trust, reliability, delivery 
time, convenience, ease of use, and above all “the experience,” as at least as important 
as price (Brynjolfsson, Dick, and Smith, 2004).
However, the Internet has created an entirely new venue for omni-channel firms 
(those that sell products through a variety of channels and integrate their physical 
stores with their websites and mobile platform), and in some cases, the Internet has 
supported the development of pure-play online-only merchants, both general mer-
chandisers as well as specialty retailers. As predicted, online retail has indeed become 
the fastest growing and most dynamic retail channel in the sense of channel innova-
tion. The Web has created a new marketplace for millions of consumers to conve-
niently shop. The Internet and the Web have continued to provide new opportunities 
for entirely new firms using new business models and new online products—such as 
Blue Nile, as previously described. The online channel can conflict with a merchant’s 
other channels, such as direct sales forces, physical stores, and mail order, but this 
multi-channel conflict can be managed and turned into a strength.
The Online Retail Sector Today
Although online retailing is one of the smallest segments of the retail industry, consti-
tuting only about 8% of the total retail market today, it is growing at a faster rate than 
its offline counterparts, with new functionality and product lines being added every 
day (see Figure 9.2). The apparel and accessories category generates the highest 
percentage of revenue, around $64 billion in 2015. Consumers have a wide choice 
of online shopping options in this category, such as omni-channel department store 
chains like Macy’s, Nordstrom, Target, and Walmart and specialty retailers like Gap, 
Zulily, J.Crew, Urban Outfitters, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Ralph Lauren. This is one 
category where Amazon does not dominate, in part because clothing shoppers tend to 
identify more strongly with a specific brand than they do with products that are more 
of a commodity, such as consumer electronics. 
The computers and consumer electronics category generates the second-highest 
percentage of revenue, around $54 billion in 2015. Online shopping options for this 
category include Amazon, direct-manufacturers such as Apple, Dell, HP, and Lenovo, 
omni-channel chains such as Best Buy, and catalog merchants such as CDW and PC 
Connection. 
The automobile and automobile parts and accessories category is in third place, 
generating around $36 billion in 2015, primarily from auto parts and accessories. 
Currently, U.S. franchising law prohibits automobile manufacturers from selling cars 
directly to consumers, so automobile retailing is dominated by dealership networks. 
Automobile manufacturers use the Internet to deliver branding advertising, while 
dealers focus on generating leads. Consumers typically focus on product and pricing 
research, which they then use to negotiate with dealers. Direct online automobile sales 
are currently not common due to the complexity of the vehicle purchasing process, 
but they are likely to become more commonplace in the future. For example, startup 
omni-channel
retailers that sell products 
through a variety of 
channels and integrate 
their physical stores with 
their website and mobile 
platform

Beepi has developed a business model based on eliminating dealers and sells used 
cars directly to consumers via a mobile app. 
Books, music, and video are among the original items sold successfully online. This 
still popular online category generated about $29 billion in 2015. Leading retailers in 
this category include Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google Play, Barnes & Noble, and Hulu. 
The furniture and home furnishing category generated about $27 billion in 2015. 
In the past, the expense of shipping large items such as furniture, mattresses, and rugs 
was a deterrent to online sales, but that is beginning to change. In addition to Amazon, 
leading online retailers in this category include other purely online companies such 
as Wayfair and Overstock, as well as omni-channel retailers such as Williams-Sonoma, 
Restoration Hardware, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Crate and Barrel.

The health and personal care (drugs, health, and beauty supplies) category has also 
enjoyed steady growth, with about $24.5 billion in revenue in 2015 (eMarketer, Inc., 
2016a).
Due to the recession, online retail revenues were basically flat from 2008 to 2009, 
but they since have resumed their upward trajectory (Figure 9.3). When we refer to 
online retail, we will not be including online services revenues such as travel, job-
hunting, or the purchase of digital downloads such as software applications and music. 
Instead, for the purposes of this chapter, online retail refers solely to sales of physical 
goods over the Internet. The Internet provides a number of unique advantages and 
challenges to online retailers. Table 9.2 summarizes these advantages and challenges.
Despite the high failure rate of online retailers in the early years, more consumers 
than ever are shopping online. For most consumers, the advantages of online shopping 
overcome the disadvantages. In 2016, it is estimated that 77% of Internet users over 
the age of 14 (around 176 million people) will buy at an online retail store, generating 
about $398 billion in online retail sales. While the number of new Internet users in 
the United States is not growing as rapidly at it was, with over 82% of the U.S. popula-
tion already on the Internet, this slowdown will not necessarily reduce the growth 
in online retail e-commerce because the average shopper is spending more on the 
Internet each year and finding many new categories of items to buy. For instance, 
in 2003, the average annual amount spent online by users was $675, but by 2016, it 
had jumped to over $2,255 (eMarketer, Inc., 2016b, 2005). Also, as noted in Chapter 6, 
millions of additional consumers research products online and are influenced in their 
purchase decisions at offline stores.

The primary beneficiaries of this growing consumer support are not only the pure 
online companies but also the established offline retailers who have the brand-name 
recognition, supportive infrastructure, and financial resources to enter the online 
marketplace successfully. Table 9.3 lists the top online retail firms ranked by online 
sales. The list contains pure-play online retailers for whom the Internet is the only 
sales channel, such as Amazon (in first place) and Newegg; omni-channel firms that 
have established brand names and for whom e-commerce still plays a relatively small 
role when compared to their offline physical store channels, such as Walmart, Sears, 
Macy’s, Home Depot, Costco, Best Buy, and Target; and manufacturers of computer and 
electronic equipment, such as Apple, Dell, and Lenovo. In 2015, Amazon accounted 
for over 25% of all online retail revenues, the top 10 retailers accounted for almost 
55% of all online retail, while the top 500 U.S. retailers accounted for about 85%. The 
next 500 accounted for an additional 5%, so just 1,000 retailers generated over 90% of 
all retail e-commerce sales. Many of the fastest growing firms are mid-size merchants, 
particularly newcomers that focus on a particular niche, such as Blue Apron, which 
uses a subscription-based sales model for make-at-home meals, and Dollar Shave Club, 
another company that uses a subscription-based sales model for inexpensive razors 
(so successful that it was acquired by Unilever for $1 billion in July 2016). Conversely, 
companies that can’t show consumers that they can offer them something of value 
not available elsewhere are likely to have a difficult time surviving. For pure-play 

594	
	
C H A P T E R  9     O n l i n e  R e t a i l  a n d  S e r v i c e s 
firms, the challenge is to turn visitors into customers, and to develop efficient opera-
tions that permit them to achieve long-term profitability. Profitability remains a key 
issue for online-only retailers. Not many of these companies are public and therefore 
required to report their financial results, but of the few that are, only a handful were 
profitable in 2015. For traditional firms that are less dependent on e-commerce sales, 
the challenge is to integrate the offline and online channels so customers can move 
seamlessly from one environment to another.
Clearly one of the most important e-commerce retail themes of 2016–2017, and 
into the future, is the ability of offline traditional firms such as Walmart, Target, Macy’s, 
and others to continue to integrate their web and mobile operations with their physical 
store operations in order to provide an “integrated shopping customer experience” and 
leverage the value of their physical stores. Table 9.4 illustrates some of the various 
ways in which traditional retailers have integrated the Web, the mobile platform, and

store operations to develop nearly seamless omni-channel shopping. This list is not 
exclusive, and retailers continue to develop new links between channels.
Rather than demonstrate disintermediation, online retailing provides an example 
of the powerful role that intermediaries continue to play in retail trade. Established 
offline retailers have rapidly gained online market share. Increasingly, consumers are 
attracted to stable, well-known, trusted retail brands and retailers. The online audience 
is very sensitive to brand names and is not primarily cost-driven. Other factors such 
as reliability, trust, fulfillment, and customer service are equally important.
The most significant changes in retail e-commerce in 2016 are the continuing 
growth in social e-commerce, the growing ability of firms to market local services 
and products through the use of location-based marketing, and not least, the rapidly 
growing mobile platform composed of smartphones and tablet computers. In retail 
circles, tablets are being called “the ultimate shopping machine,” enabling consumers 
to browse media-rich online catalogs just like they used to do with physical catalogs, 
and then buy when they feel the urge. 
Social e-commerce refers to marketing and purchasing on social network sites like 
Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat, and others. All of these sites have 
developed into major marketing and advertising platforms that help direct consumers

to external websites to purchase products. And, after trials in 2014, Facebook, Twitter, 
Pinterest, and Instagram have all introduced their own versions of “buy”  buttons that 
allow consumers to more easily purchase goods on a much wider scale. In 2015, the 
top 500 retailers in Internet Retailer’s Social Media 500 earned about $3.9 billion from 
social commerce, an over 40% increase over 2014 (Top500guide.com, 2016). 
Whereas in the past only large firms could afford to run online marketing and 
ad campaigns, this has changed with the development of local marketing firms like 
Groupon, LivingSocial, and dozens of others, which make it possible for consumers to 
receive discount deals and coupons from local merchants based on their geographic 
location. Using billions of daily e-mails, these so-called daily deal sites have sold mil-
lions of coupons to purchase local goods and services at steep discounts. For the first 
time, local merchants can advertise their products and services online at a relatively 
inexpensive cost. 
Social and local e-commerce are enabled by the tremendous growth in mobile Inter-
net devices, both smartphones and tablet computers. In 2016, U.S. retail m-commerce 
is expected to generate over $115 billion overall. In 2016, over 75% of online buyers 
are expected to make a purchase using a mobile device, and it is estimated that this 
percentage will grow to over 85% by 2020 (eMarketer, Inc., 2016e, 2016f).

ANALYZING THE VIABILITY OF ONLINE FIRMS
In this and the following chapters, we analyze the viability of a number of online com-
panies that exemplify specific e-commerce models. We are primarily interested in under-
standing the near-to-medium term (1–3 years) economic viability of these firms and their 
business models. Economic viability refers to the ability of firms to survive as profitable 
business firms during the specified period. To answer the question of economic viability, 
we take two business analysis approaches: strategic analysis and financial analysis.
STRATEGIC ANALYSIS
Strategic approaches to economic viability focus on both the industry in which a firm 
operates and the firm itself (see Chapter 2, Sections 2.2 and 2.5). The key industry 
strategic factors are:
•	 Barriers to entry: Can new entrants be barred from entering the industry through 
high capital costs or intellectual property barriers (such as patents and copyrights)?
•	 Power of suppliers: Can suppliers dictate high prices to the industry or can vendors 
choose from among many suppliers? Have firms achieved sufficient scale to bargain 
effectively for lower prices from suppliers?
•	 Power of customers: Can customers choose from many competing suppliers and 
hence challenge high prices and high margins?
•	 Existence of substitute products: Can the functionality of the product or service be 
obtained from alternative channels or competing products in different industries? 
Are substitute products and services likely to emerge in the near future?
economic viability 
refers to the ability of firms 
to survive as profitable 
business firms during a 
specified period

•	 Industry value chain: Is the chain of production and distribution in the industry 
changing in ways that benefit or harm the firm?
•	 Nature of intra-industry competition: Is the basis of competition within the industry based 
on differentiated products and services, price, scope of offerings, or focus of offerings? 
How is the nature of competition changing? Will these changes benefit the firm?
The strategic factors that pertain specifically to the firm and its related businesses 
include:
•	 Firm value chain: Has the firm adopted business processes and methods of operation 
that allow it to achieve the most efficient operations in its industry? Will changes 
in technology force the firm to realign its business processes?
•	 Core competencies: Does the firm have unique competencies and skills that cannot 
be easily duplicated by other firms? Will changes in technology invalidate the firm’s 
competencies or strengthen them?
•	 Synergies: Does the firm have access to the competencies and assets of related firms 
either owned outright or through strategic partnerships and alliances?
•	 Technology: Has the firm developed proprietary technologies that allow it to scale 
with demand? Has the firm developed the operational technologies (e.g., cus-
tomer relationship management, fulfillment, supply chain management, inventory 
control, and human resource systems) to survive?
•	 Social and legal challenges: Has the firm put in place policies to address consumer 
trust issues (privacy and security of personal information)? Is the firm the subject 
of lawsuits challenging its business model, such as intellectual property owner-
ship issues? Will the firm be affected by changes in Internet taxation laws or other 
foreseeable statutory developments?
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Strategic analysis helps us comprehend the competitive situation of the firm. Financial 
analysis helps us understand how in fact the firm is performing. There are two parts 
to a financial analysis: the statement of operations and the balance sheet. The state-
ment of operations tells us how much money (or loss) the firm is achieving based on 
current sales and costs. The balance sheet tells us how many assets the firm has to 
support its current and future operations.
Here are some of the key factors to look for in a firm’s statement of operations:
•	 Revenues: Are revenues growing and at what rate? Many e-commerce companies 
have experienced impressive, even explosive, revenue growth as an entirely new 
channel is created.
•	 Cost of sales: What is the cost of sales compared to revenues? Cost of sales typically 
includes the cost of the products sold and related costs. The lower the cost of sales 
compared to revenue, the higher the gross profit.
•	 Gross margin: What is the firm’s gross margin, and is it increasing or decreasing? Gross 
margin is calculated by dividing gross profit by net sales revenues. Gross margin can 
tell you if the firm is gaining or losing market power vis-à-vis its key suppliers.

•	 Operating expenses: What are the firm’s operating expenses, and are they increasing 
or decreasing? Operating expenses typically include the cost of marketing, technol-
ogy, and administrative overhead. They also include, in accordance with profes-
sional accounting standards (see below), stock-based compensation to employees 
and executives, amortization of goodwill and other intangibles, and impairment 
of investments. In e-commerce companies, these turn out to be very important 
expenses. Many e-commerce firms compensated their employees with stock shares 
(or options), and many e-commerce firms purchased other e-commerce firms as a 
part of their growth strategy. Many of the companies were purchased at extremely 
high values using company stock rather than cash; in numerous instances, the 
purchased companies fell dramatically in market value. All these items are counted 
as normal operating expenses.
•	 Operating margin: What did the firm earn from its current operations? Operating 
margin is calculated by dividing operating income or loss by net sales revenue. 
Operating margin is an indication of a company’s ability to turn sales into pre-tax 
profit after operating expenses have been deducted. Operating margin tells us if 
the firm’s current operations are covering its operating expenses, not including 
interest expenses and other non-operating expenses.
•	 Net margin: Net margin tells us the percentage of its gross sales revenue the firm 
was able to retain after all expenses are deducted. Net margin is calculated by divid-
ing net income or loss by net sales revenue. Net margin sums up in one number 
how successful a company has been at the business of making a profit on each dollar 
of sales revenues. Net margin also tells us something about the efficiency of the firm 
by measuring the percentage of sales revenue it is able to retain after all expenses 
are deducted from gross revenues, and, within a single industry, it can be used to 
measure the relative efficiency of competing firms. Net margin takes into account 
many non-operating expenses such as interest and stock compensation plans.
When examining the financial announcements of e-commerce companies, it is impor-
tant to realize that online firms often choose not to announce their net income according 
to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These principles have been promul-
gated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), a board of professional accoun-
tants that establishes accounting rules for the profession, and which has played a vital 
role since the 1934 Securities Act, which sought to improve financial accounting during 
the Great Depression. Many e-commerce firms in the early years instead reported an 
entirely new calculation called pro forma earnings (also called EBITDA—earnings before 
income taxes, depreciation, and amortization). Pro forma earnings generally do not deduct 
stock-based compensation, depreciation, or amortization. The result is that pro forma 
earnings are always better than GAAP earnings. The firms that report in this manner 
typically claim these expenses are non-recurring and special and “unusual.” In 2002 and 
2003, the SEC issued new guidelines (Regulation G) that prohibit firms from reporting 
pro forma earnings in official reports to the SEC, but still allow firms to announce pro 
forma earnings in public statements (Weil, 2003). Throughout this book, we consider a 
firm’s income or loss based on GAAP accounting standards only.

such as cash, securities, accounts receivable, inventory, or other investments that are 
likely to be able to be converted to cash within one year. Liabilities are outstanding 
obligations of the firm. Current liabilities are debts of the firm that will be due within 
one year. Liabilities that are not due until the passage of a year or more are character-
ized as long-term debt. For a quick check of a firm’s short-term financial health, 
examine its working capital (the firm’s current assets minus current liabilities). If 
working capital is only marginally positive, or negative, the firm will likely have trouble 
meeting its short-term obligations. Alternatively, if a firm has a large amount of current 
assets, it can sustain operational losses for a period of time.

E-COMMERCE IN ACTION: E-TAILING BUSINESS 
MODELS
So far, we have been discussing online retail as if it were a single entity. In fact, as 
we briefly discussed in Chapter 2, there are four main types of online retail business 
models: virtual merchants, omni-channel merchandisers (sometimes referred to as 
bricks-and-clicks or clicks-and-bricks), catalog merchants, and manufacturer-direct 
firms. Figure 9.4 illustrates the respective shares of 2015 online retail sales for each 
of these categories of firms. In addition, there are thousands of small retailers that use 
the eBay and Amazon sales platforms, as well as affiliate merchants whose primary

FIGURE 9.4	
SHARE OF ONLINE RETAIL SALES BY TYPE OF COMPANY
Virtual merchants account for over 40% of online retail sales, although this percentage is heavily skewed by 
the dominance of Amazon, which by itself accounts for almost 25%. However, the percentage accounted for 
by omni-channel merchants has been steadily increasing over the last few years.

revenue derives from sending traffic to their “mother” sites. Each of these different 
types of online retailers faces a different strategic environment, as well as different 
industry and firm economics.
VIRTUAL MERCHANTS
Virtual merchants are single-channel e-commerce firms that generate almost all 
their revenue from online sales. Virtual merchants face extraordinary strategic chal-
lenges. They must build a business and brand name from scratch, quickly, in an 
entirely new channel and confront many virtual merchant competitors (especially in 
smaller niche areas). Because these firms typically do not have any physical stores, 
they do not have to bear the costs associated with developing and maintaining physi-
cal stores but they face large costs in building and maintaining an e-commerce pres-
ence, building an order fulfillment infrastructure, and developing a brand name. 
Customer acquisition costs are high, and the learning curve is steep. Like all retail 
firms, their gross margins (the difference between the retail price of goods sold and 
the cost of goods to the retailer) are low. Therefore, virtual merchants must achieve 
highly efficient operations in order to preserve a profit, while building a brand name 
as quickly as possible in order to attract sufficient customers to cover their costs of 
operations. Most merchants in this category adopt low-cost and convenience strategies, 
coupled with extremely effective and efficient fulfillment processes to ensure custom-
ers receive what they ordered as fast as possible. In the following E-commerce in Action 
section, we take an in-depth look at the strategic and financial situation of Amazon, 
the leading online virtual merchant. In addition to Amazon, other successful virtual 
merchants include Newegg, Overstock, Gilt Groupe, Zulily, Wayfair, Rue La La, Blue 
Nile (profiled in the opening case), Bluefly, Hayneedle, Yoox Net-a-Porter, Shoebuy, 
and Choxi. Recently, a new group of virtual merchants have emerged that use a sub-
scription revenue model. Examples include Birchbox (personalized beauty samples 
delivered monthly), Stitch Fix (clothing selected by a personal stylist) (see the Insight 
on Technology case, Big Data and Predictive Marketing, on pages 594–595 for more on 
Stitch Fix), Barkbox (pet supplies), Naturebox (healthy snacks), Bulu Box (supplements 
and vitamins), and hundreds more. According to Internet Retailer, overall, virtual 
merchants accounted for over $140 billion (about 42%) of online retail sales by the 
Internet Retailer Top 1000 merchants in 2015 (eMarketer, Inc., 2016g, 2016h).
AMAZON
Amazon, the Seattle-based virtual merchant, is one of the most well-known names in the 
world. As stated in its annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Com-
mission, Amazon’s objective is to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. Exactly 
what this means, and how it might be possible to achieve it, is a matter of speculation 
for both customers and investors. Yet in pursuing this goal, Jeff Bezos and his team have 
built the world’s most successful and innovative online retailer.

Few business enterprises have experienced the roller-coaster ride from explosive 
early growth, to huge losses, and then on to profitability that Amazon has. No Internet 
business has been both so widely reviled and so hotly praised throughout its develop-
ment. Its stock reflects these changing fortunes, fluctuating over the past 15 years, from 
an early high of $106 in 1999, to a low of $6 a share in 2001, then bouncing back and 
forth between $50–$90 in 2003–2009, and then climbing again to a high of over $810 
in 2016. While controversial, Amazon has also been one of the most innovative online 
retailing stories in the history of e-commerce. From the earliest days of e-commerce, 
Amazon has continuously adapted its business model based on both its market experi-
ence and its insight into the online consumer.
The Vision
The original vision of founder Jeff Bezos and his friends was that the Internet was a 
revolutionary new form of commerce and that only companies that became really 
big early on (ignoring profitability) would survive. The path to success, according to 
founder Bezos, was to offer consumers three things: the lowest prices, the best selec-
tion, and convenience (which translates into feature-rich content, user-generated 
reviews of books and products, fast and reliable fulfillment, and ease of use). Currently, 
Amazon offers consumers millions of unique new, used, and collectible items in a 
variety of different categories, both physical and digital. Its physical goods include 
books, movies, music, and games; electronics and computers; home, garden, and tools; 
grocery; health and beauty; toys, kids, and baby; clothing, shoes, and jewelry; sports 
and outdoors; and auto and industrial. Its digital products include unlimited instant 
videos, digital games and software, MP3s and Cloud Player, Audible audiobooks, and 
Kindle e-book reader products. And if Amazon does not carry it, it will help you find 
it at online merchants who “rent space” from Amazon, or even at an external online 
vendor. In short, Amazon has become the largest, one-stop online merchant, a kind 
of combined “shopping portal” and “product search portal” that puts it in direct com-
petition with other large online general merchants, eBay, and general portals such as 
Yahoo, MSN, and even Google. As Amazon succeeded in becoming the world’s largest 
online store, it also expanded its original vision to become one of the largest suppliers 
of online merchant and search services. 
Business Model
Amazon’s business is currently organized into two basic segments: North American 
and International. Within those segments, it serves not only retail customers but also 
merchants and developers. The retail component of the business sells physical and 
digital products that Amazon has purchased and then resells to consumers just like 
a traditional retailer. It also manufactures and sells a variety of versions of its Kindle 
e-reader and Kindle Fire series of devices, including tablet computers and smart TVs. 
The Fire smartphone proved unsuccessful, due to a lack of available apps, but the 
Echo in-home assistant has garnered rave reviews and could be Amazon’s next must-
have device.
Another major component of Amazon’s business is its third-party merchant segment. 
Amazon Services enables third parties to integrate their products into Amazon’s website, 

602	
	
C H A P T E R  9     O n l i n e  R e t a i l  a n d  S e r v i c e s 
and use Amazon’s customer technologies. In the early years of its business, Amazon 
entered into partnerships with large merchants such as Toys“R”Us, Borders, and Target, 
and created storefronts for these companies within the larger Amazon site. Today, 
Amazon has increasingly left the enterprise-level business to competitors and instead 
focused its efforts on small and medium-sized retail merchants. 
Thousands of these types of merchants have signed on with Amazon, offering 
products that in some instances even compete with those that Amazon itself sells. For 
instance, a single product on the Amazon website may be listed for sale simultaneously 
by Amazon, by a large branded merchant participant such as Target, and by a business 
or individual selling a new, used, or collectible version of the product through Amazon 
Marketplace. For these types of merchants, Amazon is not the seller of record, does not 
own these products, and the shipping of products is usually handled by the third party 
(although in some instances, Amazon provides fulfillment services as well). Amazon 
collects a monthly fixed fee, sales commission (generally estimated to be between 
10% and 20% of the sale), per-unit activity fee, or some combination thereof from the 
third party. In this segment, Amazon acts as an online shopping mall, collecting “rents” 
from other merchants and providing “site” services such as order entry and payment. 
Another major part of Amazon’s business is Amazon Web Services (AWS). Through 
this segment, Amazon offers a variety of web services that provide developers with 
direct access to Amazon’s technology platform and allow them to build their own 
applications based on that platform. In 2016, AWS is expected to account for $10 billion 
in revenues, up from nearly $8 billion in 2015 and $4.6 billion in 2014, and delivered 
more profits than Amazon’s retail business. Refer to Chapter 3 for a more detailed 
examination of AWS. 
Despite the profitability of AWS, Amazon still generates the bulk of its overall 
revenue by selling products. While Amazon started out as an online merchant of books, 
CDs, and DVDs, since 2002, it has diversified into becoming a general merchandiser 
of millions of other products. Amazon has turned itself into a major online media and 
content firm and, following its success with Kindle e-books, has also made a strong 
move into the music and streaming video business, with Amazon Music and Amazon 
Instant Video. In 2015, about 20% of its revenue came from media sales while electron-
ics and general merchandise accounted for about 70%. In addition to Amazon.com in 
the United States, Amazon also operates a number of localized sites in Europe, Asia, 
and Canada. Although Amazon derived 33% of its gross revenue offshore in 2015, 
down from 37% in 2014, total international sales still improved—just not as fast as 
domestic sales. 
Financial Analysis
Amazon’s revenues have increased from about $600 million in 1998 to an astounding 
$107 billion in 2015 (see Table 9.5). From 2011 to 2015, Amazon’s revenues have more 
than doubled. This is very impressive, explosive revenue growth. However, Amazon’s 
growth strategies have made it difficult for the company to maintain consistent profits 
in the past. Although it showed a profit of $631 million in 2011, in 2012, Amazon expe-
rienced a net loss of $39 million. In 2013, it reversed that loss and reported net income

of $274 million but still fell short of analysts’ estimates. In 2014, Amazon once again 
reported a net loss of $241 million, due in large part to operating expenses that rose 
from $19 billion in 2013 to $26 billion in 2014. But at long last, Amazon registered a 
string of profitable quarters in 2015,  continuing into 2016, with expectations of more to 
come. Investors who speculated that Amazon would continue to grow and ultimately 
earn significant profits look to have been proven right. In the second quarter of 2016, 
Amazon earned $857 million in profit, up from $92 million in the same quarter of 2015. 
At the end of December 2015, Amazon had about $19.8 billion in cash and market-
able securities. These liquid assets were obtained from sales, sales of stock and notes 
to the public, venture capital investors, and institutional investors in return for equity 
(shares) in the company or debt securities. Total assets are about $65 billion. The 
company emphasizes the strength of its “free cash flow” as a sign of financial strength, 
suggesting it has more than enough cash available to cover short-term liabilities (such 
as financing holiday season purchasing). Amazon’s current assets should certainly be 
enough to cover future short-term deficits should they occur.
Strategic Analysis—Business Strategy
Amazon engages in a number of business strategies that seek to maximize growth in 
sales volume, while cutting prices to the bare bones. Its revenue growth strategies 
include driving the growth of e-book sales by offering continuing enhancements 
of its Kindle e-reader and Kindle Fire tablet computer, both in the United States 
and internationally, as well as new e-book publishing initiatives; expanding further 
into the device manufacturing business, with Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Echo; 
expanding its music and streaming video business, with its Amazon Music and 
Instant Video services; expanding its Amazon Web Services offerings and extending 
their geographic reach; moving toward a broader trading platform by expanding the 
third-party seller segment; and moving toward greater product focus by grouping 
its offerings into major categories called stores. Amazon is still following Walmart’s 
and eBay’s examples by attempting to be a mass-market, low-price, high-volume 
online supermarket where you can get just about anything. To achieve profitability 
in this environment, Amazon has invested heavily in supply chain management 
and fulfillment strategies to reduce its costs to the bare minimum while providing 
excellent customer service and even free shipping.
Specific programs to increase retail revenues are the continuation of free ship-
ping from Amazon Retail (a strategy that has increased order sizes by 25%), Amazon 
Prime (which for $99 a year provides free two-day shipping and one-day delivery 
upgrades for $3.99, as well as free access to Prime Music and Prime Video), greater 
product selection, and shorter order fulfillment times. Amazon Prime membership 
is steadily increasing, with an estimated 54 million members in the United States in 
2016. Usage is also increasing: in 2015, Prime Video streaming hours grew 47% in 
the United States and 51% internationally, and Prime Music streaming hours tripled 
in 2015 over the previous year. Amazon offers customers same-day shipping in 14 
markets in the United States and now offers its Prime Now one-hour delivery service 
in nine cities. A ticking clock can be seen next to some Amazon sale items indicat-
ing the hours remaining for an order to make it to the customer by the next day.

Amazon has moved strongly into the mobile shopping space as well, with shop-
ping apps for the iPhone, BlackBerry, Android, Windows Phone, and iPad. It also has 
Deals, Price Check, and Student apps for the iPhone and has opened an Appstore 
for Android applications. In 2015, it rolled out the initial version of its Amazon 
Prime Now mobile app, which is quickly expanding across the United States and 
offers delivery speeds as fast as one hour. Amazon maintains a dominant position in 
mobile commerce in 2016, with an amazing 93% of smartphone shoppers reporting 
that they shop on Amazon, with most of those shoppers making the majority of their 
mobile purchases on Amazon. Amazon has not been as successful in developing its 
own smartphone, however. In 2015, it withdrew its resources from the continued 
development of the Amazon Fire phone, which had opened to underwhelming sales 
in 2014 and never developed an audience. 
Amazon has continued to build on the rousing success of its Kindle e-book reader 
platform, which it has touted as the best-selling product in its history. It has continued 
to release iterations of the Kindle e-book reader and Fire. According to Amazon, it now 
sells more Kindle books than all print books combined. 
In 2012, Amazon increased its efforts in the entertainment business, adding 
content to its Instant Video library through an expanded content licensing agree-
ment with NBC Universal and similar arrangements with CBS, Viacom, and nearly 
every major Hollywood studio. Further agreements were inked with Viacom, PBS, 
A+E, Scripps Networks, and FX in 2013. In 2014, it added HBO and developed a 
series of original shows to keep pace with closest competitor Netflix. In 2015, Amazon 
announced that its content creation arm, Amazon Studios, would begin to develop 
original movies for theatrical release. These films will move to Amazon Prime within 
just a month or two of their debut.
On the cost side, Amazon increasingly uses “postal injection” for shipping, in 
which Amazon trucks deliver pre-posted packages to U.S. Postal System centers. 
In 2012, Amazon began an aggressive strategy to build warehouses all across the 
country to improve its delivery speeds. This has continued through 2016, with new 
fulfillment centers opening in New Jersey, Texas, and North Carolina. Many of 
Amazon’s customers who had previously been exempt must now pay sales tax due 
to legislation in a number of states. With this competitive advantage evaporating, 
Amazon is seeking to trump all competitors on delivery speed. The ultimate goal 
for Bezos and Amazon: same-day delivery in many areas of the country.
To that end, Amazon has taken steps to expand its delivery capability in several 
ways, including drone delivery and cargo jets. Amazon Prime Air is Amazon’s drone 
delivery project, which would be capable of delivering packages up to 5 pounds 
in weight—upwards of 80% of all shipments. Until recently, this type of delivery 
method seemed closer to science fiction than reality, but Amazon appears closer 
than ever to making it work, despite the engineering and legal hurdles. In 2016, 
Amazon also agreed to lease 40 Boeing 767 jets to help manage its ever-increasing 
shipping demands. The company has also purchased a fleet of its own trucks and 
investigated the development self-driving delivery vehicles. Though it may look 
like Amazon is trying to take full control of its delivery operations, Amazon isn’t 
likely to end its relationships with FedEx or UPS—the overall volume of its orders

has become too high for that. However, these moves could dramatically improve 
per-order profit margins for the majority of Amazon orders, making life even more 
difficult for Amazon’s traditional bricks-and-mortar competitors.
Strategic Analysis—Competition
Amazon has both offline and online competition. Major competitors include eBay 
(its primary online competitor) and omni-channel retailers such as Walmart, Sears, 
and JCPenney. In 2016, Walmart purchased discount Amazon competitor Jet.com for 
$3.3 billion as it continued to suffer at the hands of Amazon, both falling behind in 
overall market capitalization and stalling in e-commerce growth as Amazon booms. 
Amazon also competes in a number of product areas with catalog merchants such 
as L.L.Bean and Lands’ End and with other online bookstores such as Barnesand-
noble.com. Insofar as portal sites such as MSN and Yahoo operate online stores, 
they are also competitors. As Walmart continues to recede as a threat to Amazon, 
the company’s biggest threat may be China-based Alibaba, which handles more busi-
ness worldwide than eBay and Amazon combined and which went public in 2014. 
Amazon also competes with web services firms that provide hosting, shopping cart, 
and fulfillment services. What’s more, it has fully engaged iTunes and Netflix in 
competition by offering video and audio downloads. Amazon Music allows users to 
store and play music online, offers over 35 million DRM-free MP3 songs from both 
major music labels and thousands of independent labels, and can be played on vir-
tually any hardware device and managed with any music software. Amazon Instant 
Video offers over 138,000 movies and TV shows to rent or buy, and Amazon Prime 
Music, launched in 2014, offers over 1.7 million tracks that users can stream for free.
Strategic Analysis—Technology
Anyone who believes that information technology doesn’t make a difference clearly 
does not know much about Amazon. Amazon arguably has the largest and most sophis-
ticated collection of online retailing technologies available at any single online site. 
It has implemented numerous website management, search, customer interaction, 
recommendation, transaction processing, and fulfillment services and systems using a 
combination of its own proprietary technologies and commercially available, licensed 
technologies. Amazon’s transaction-processing systems handle millions of items, 
numerous status inquiries, gift-wrapping requests, and multiple shipment methods. 
Customers can receive orders in single or multiple shipments, based on availabil-
ity, and track the progress of each order. On the fulfillment side, every warehouse 
employee carries a shoehorn-sized device that combines a bar code scanner, a display 
screen, and a two-way data transmitter. It continues to invest heavily in AWS, new ver-
sions of the Kindle e-reader, and consumer electronics such as the Kindle Fire devices, 
as well as projects like drone delivery and the Amazon Echo home assistant, which it 
hopes will become an indispensable gadget in the home the way that smartphones are 
outside of it. Powered by its state-of-the-art speech recognition and cloud connectiv-
ity, the Echo has a diverse range of features that range from streaming music, doing 
math, updating to-do lists, getting the weather, playing games, and much more. Echo 
users can already manage many household appliances with the device, and as more

appliances are built with Internet connectivity, this feature will only become more 
useful. In 2015, Amazon spent over $12.5 billion on technology and new content and 
is on track to spend even more in 2015.
Strategic Analysis—Social and Legal Challenges
Amazon continually faces lawsuits concerning various aspects of its business. Most 
common are patent infringement suits, largely settled out of court. Currently, there 
are several pending patent suits, including some involving the Kindle. 
In recent years, Amazon has faced increased challenges from states eager to begin 
collecting sales taxes from online purchases. Until 2011, only customers in five states 
were required to pay sales taxes. Between distribution center expansion and state legis-
lation requiring large online sellers to collect sales tax even in the absence of a physical 
presence, that number has ballooned to 28 states and 84% of all U.S. consumers in 
2016. Early on, many states had offered Amazon tax break deals to lure its business, 
perhaps not expecting that untaxed sales would become billions of dollars in lost tax 
revenue. As many of those deals expire, Amazon has already begun an aggressive (and 
costly) expansion of its warehousing infrastructure across the United States to support 
same-day delivery. The rising costs of shipping expenses, which increased 44% in 2015 
to $3.36 billion, represent one of the biggest threats to Amazon’s long-term profitabil-
ity, which explains the company’s renewed efforts to explore shipping alternatives.
Future Prospects
In 2016, Amazon finally began to show investors and analysts what they had been 
waiting years to see—sustainable profitability. The company expects continued strong 
profitability after its landmark $879 million profit in the second quarter of 2016.  The 
profitability of its AWS unit is also a major positive for Amazon, and that segment 
showed continued rapid growth. Amazon Prime is also a key component of the com-
pany’s strong performance. While the company continues to spend heavily on future 
products and services, Amazon at last appears to have turned the corner to profitability 
(Amazon, 2016a, 2016b; Manjoo, 2016a, 2016b; Bensinger, 2016a, 2016b; Bensinger and 
Nassauer, 2016; Berthene, 2016; Roettgers, 2016; Kline, 2016). 
OMNI-CHANNEL MERCHANTS: BRICKS-AND-CLICKS
Also called omni-channel merchants, bricks-and-clicks companies have a network 
of physical stores as their primary retail channel, but also have online offerings. Omni-
channel firms include Walmart, Macy’s, Sears, JCPenney, Staples, OfficeMax, Costco, 
Target, and other brand-name merchants. While bricks-and-clicks merchants face high 
costs of physical buildings and large sales staffs, they also have many advantages such 
as a brand name, a national customer base, warehouses, large scale (giving them lever-
age with suppliers), and a trained staff. Acquiring customers is less expensive because 
of their brand names, but these firms face challenges in coordinating prices across 
bricks-and-clicks 
companies that have a 
network of physical stores 
as their primary retail 
channel, but have also 
introduced online offerings

channels and handling returns of online purchases at their retail outlets. However, 
these retail players are used to operating on very thin margins and have invested 
heavily in purchasing and inventory control systems to control costs, and in coordinat-
ing returns from multiple locations. Bricks-and-clicks companies face the challenge 
of leveraging their strengths and assets to the Web, building a credible website, hiring 
new skilled staff, and building rapid-response order entry and fulfillment systems. 
According to Internet Retailer, in 2015, omni-channel bricks-and-clicks retailers 
accounted for around $109 billion (around 32%) of all the Internet Retailer Top 1000’s 
online retail sales (eMarketer, Inc., 2016g, 2016h). 
Macy’s is a prime example of a traditional merchant based on physical stores 
moving successfully to become an omni-channel retailer. Rowland H. Macy opened 
the first R.H. Macy & Co. store in New York City in 1858, and moved the flagship store 
(now the site of the famous Macy’s Thanksgiving parade) to Herald Square at 34th 
Street and Broadway in 1902. Today, Macy’s is one of the largest national department 
store chains, with around 775 Macy’s department stores throughout the United States.
Like many traditional retailers, Macy’s has had to change its business model to 
accommodate the Internet. Macy’s (then called Federated Department Stores Inc.) 
jumped into e-commerce in 1995 with the creation of the Macys.com website. In 1999, 
Federated bought Fingerhut, at that time a leading catalog and direct marketer, in 
part for its expertise in e-commerce fulfillment and database management. Although 
the Fingerhut acquisition did not prove to be a financial success, Macy’s e-commerce 
efforts benefitted from the acquisition.
Macy’s ranked 6th on Internet Retailer’s list of the top 500 online retailers, with 
about $6.2 billion in online sales in 2015, representing double-digit growth and around 
23% of total sales. Growth of its physical store sales pales by comparison, and in 2016, 
it announced plans to close 100 stores in the coming year as it focuses more and 
more on its e-commerce operations. In October 2016, it announced plans to launch 
an e-commerce site in China in 2017. It is already one of the most popular sellers on 
Alibaba’s Tmall Global website, where it began selling in November 2015.
The Macy’s website receives around 14 million monthly unique visitors. Website 
features and functions include an interactive catalog, enlarged product views, and 
ability to see products in different colors and from alternate views, including via 
zoom and videos. It also offers product comparisons, product ratings, and product 
recommendations, as well as a real-time inventory check system. Macy’s ranked 6th 
in the 2016 National Retail Federation Favorite Retail Stores survey of companies 
with respect to the best e-commerce sites for convenience, safety, and customer 
service.
Macy’s has jumped into social media as well, with a Facebook page that has over 
14 million Likes, a Twitter feed with over 940,000 followers, a Pinterest page with 48 
different boards, over 925,000 pins, 225,000 followers, and a YouTube channel with 
over 19 million views. Macy’s is also an early adopter of Buyable Pins introduced by 
Pinterest.
Mobile sales at Macy’s are booming, and reached an estimated $1.26 billion in 2015, 
up 60% from $790 million in 2014 according to Internet Retailer. It has iPhone and 
Android apps, new versions of which it launched in 2014, and an HMTL5 mobile website 

powered by Usablenet. In 2016, it plans to enhance its mobile site and apps by adding addi-
tional filters so mobile shoppers more easily find what they need. It is also considering 
ways to provide more information to mobile shoppers such as product reviews and natural 
language search. It has also tried QR codes, SMS marketing, and augmented reality. 
In 2016, Macy’s also continues to focus on refining its omni-channel approach, 
encompassing its physical stores, its website, and the mobile platform. It was among 
the first retailers to support Apple Pay, Apple’s mobile payment system, offering it in 
addition to Macy’s own mobile wallet that allows shoppers to virtually store and access 
offers and coupons. It offers same-day delivery of products ordered online in 8 major 
U.S. markets, using Deliv, a crowd-sourced delivery provider. Its Buy Online Pickup 
In Store program, piloted in 2013, has rolled out to all Macy’s stores nationwide. In 
2016, it introduced its Macy’s On Call mobile app on a pilot basis in 10 stores around 
the country. The app uses IBM Watson’s natural language processing, machine learn-
ing and cognitive computing technology, coupled with location-based GPS software 
to assist shoppers as they move through the store. Macy’s has also expanded its use of 
iBeacons to all of its stores nationwide (see Chapter 7) (Macy’s, 2015; Internet Retailer, 
2016a; Lindner, 2016; Tong, 2016; Smith, 2016; Gagliordi, 2016).
CATALOG MERCHANTS
Catalog merchants such as Lands’ End, L.L.Bean, CDW Corp., PC Connection, and 
Cabela’s are established companies that have a national offline catalog operation, but 
who have also developed online capabilities. Catalog merchants face very high costs 
for printing and mailing millions of catalogs each year—many of which have a half-life 
of 30 seconds after the customer receives them. Catalog merchants typically have 
developed centralized fulfillment and call centers, extraordinary service, and excellent 
fulfillment in partnership with package delivery firms such as FedEx and UPS. Catalog 
firms have suffered in recent years as catalog sales growth rates have fallen. As a result, 
catalog merchants have had to diversify their channels either by building stores 
(L.L.Bean), being bought by store-based firms (Sears purchased Lands’ End), or by 
building a strong online presence.
Catalog firms are uniquely advantaged because they already possess very efficient 
order entry and fulfillment systems. However, they face many of the same challenges 
as bricks-and-mortar stores—they must leverage their existing assets and competen-
cies to a new technology environment, build a credible online presence, and hire new 
staff. Nevertheless, in 2015, the Internet Retailer Top 1000 catalog merchants generated 
combined online sales of over $31 billion (eMarketer, Inc., 2016g, 2016h).
Arguably one of the most well-known online catalog merchants is LandsEnd.com. 
Lands’ End started out in 1963 in a basement of Chicago’s tannery district selling sail-
boat equipment and clothing, handling 15 orders on a good day. Since then it expanded 
into a direct catalog merchant, distributing over 200 million catalogs annually and 
selling a much expanded line of “traditionally” styled sport clothing, soft luggage, 
and products for the home. Lands’ End was one of the first apparel retailers to have 
an e-commerce-enabled website, launching in 1995 with 100 products and travelogue 
essays. In 2015, it launched a significantly redesigned website featuring a new online 
catalog with more brands, improved search and navigation, streamlined checkout, and 
catalog merchants 
established companies that 
have a national offline 
catalog operation that is 
their largest retail channel, 
but who have recently 
developed online 
capabilities

new payment types such as Visa Pay.  In 2016, it plans to launch a new mobile app 
and make further improvements to its website in time for the holiday season (Lands’ 
End, Inc., 2016; Maple, 2016). Located in Dodgeville, Wisconsin, it has since grown 
into one of the Web’s most successful apparel sites.
Lands’ End has always been on the leading edge of online retailing technolo-
gies, most of which emphasize personal marketing and customized products. Lands’ 
End was the first e-commerce website to allow customers to create a 3-D model of 
themselves to “try on” clothing. Lands’ End “Get Live Help” enables customers to chat 
online with customer service representatives; Lands’ End Custom allows customers to 
create custom-crafted clothing built for their personal measurements. While custom-
ized clothing built online was thought to be a gimmick in the early years of online 
retailing, today, 40% of Lands’ End clothing sold online is customized. In 2003, Lands’ 
End was purchased by Sears (which itself was purchased by Kmart in 2004) and then 
was spun off as an independent company again in 2014. In 2016, Lands’ End was 19th 
on Internet Retailer’s 2016 Top 500 online retailers and 15th on the National Retail 
Foundation’s Favorite 50 survey (Internet Retailer, 2016; Smith, 2016). Features that 
garner praise include live video chat, product recommendations that reflect a shop-
per’s preferences, content display based on the shopper’s location and referral source, 
and iPhone and iPad apps that deliver Lands’ End catalogs to mobile users. The digital 
catalogs contain exclusive content, including stories written by Lands’ End employees. 
Shoppers can also visit Lands’ End on Facebook, where it has over 1.2 million Likes. 
Lands’ End also has a Twitter presence, where it has about 65,000 followers, and 38 
different Pinterest boards with 12,500 followers (Lands’ End, Inc., 2016b).
MANUFACTURER-DIRECT
Manufacturer-direct firms are either single- or multi-channel manufacturers that 
sell directly online to consumers without the intervention of retailers. Manufacturer-
direct firms were predicted to play a very large role in e-commerce manufacturers, 
but this has generally not happened. The primary exceptions are computer hard-
ware, such as Apple, Dell, and Hewlett-Packard, and apparel manufacturers, such 
as Ralph Lauren, Nike, Under Armour, Carter’s, Tory Burch, Deckers, Kate Spade, 
Jones Retail, and Vera Bradley. Nike is the only consumer brand manufacturer 
whose direct-to-consumer website was ranked in the NRF’s Favorite 50 2016 survey, 
coming in at 17th, up from 33rd in 2015 (Smith, 2016). Most consumer products 
manufacturers do not sell directly online, although this has started to change. For 
instance, Procter & Gamble offers Pgshop, which carries over 50 different Procter 
& Gamble brands. Overall, manufacturer-direct firms accounted for over $57 billion 
(about 17%) of Internet Retailer’s Top 1000 online retail sales (eMarketer, Inc., 2016g, 
2016h).
Manufacturer-direct firms sometimes face channel conflict challenges. Channel 
conflict occurs when retailers of products must compete on price and currency of 
inventory directly against the manufacturer, who does not face the cost of maintaining 
inventory, physical stores, or sales staffs. Firms with no prior direct marketing experi-
ence face the additional challenges of developing a fast-response online order and 
fulfillment system, acquiring customers, and coordinating their supply chains with 
manufacturer-direct

market demand. Switching from a supply-push model (where products are made 
prior to orders received based on estimated demand and then stored in warehouses 
awaiting sale) to a demand-pull model (where products are not built until an order 
is received) has proved extremely difficult for traditional manufacturers. Yet for many 
products, manufacturer-direct firms have the advantage of an established national 
brand name, an existing large customer base, and a lower cost structure than even 
catalog merchants because they are the manufacturer of the goods and thus do not 
pay profits to anyone else. Therefore, manufacturer-direct firms should have higher 
margins.
One of the most frequently cited manufacturer-direct retailers is Dell Inc., the 
world’s largest direct computer systems supplier, providing corporations, govern-
ment agencies, small-to-medium businesses, and individuals with computer products 
and services ordered straight from the manufacturer’s headquarters in Austin, Texas. 
Although sales representatives support corporate customers, individuals and smaller 
businesses buy direct from Dell by phone, fax, and via the Internet, with about $3.7 
billion in sales generated online to consumers in 2015 (ranking 2nd only to Apple 
among consumer brand manufacturers) (Internet Retailer, 2016).
When Michael Dell started the company in 1984 in his college dorm room, his 
idea was to custom-build computers for customers, to eliminate the middleman, and 
more effectively meet the technology needs of his customers. Today, the company 
sells much more than individual computer systems; it also offers enterprise systems, 
desktop, and laptop computers, as well as installation, financing, repair, and manage-
ment services. By relying on a build-to-order manufacturing process, the company 
achieves faster inventory turnover (five days), and reduced component and finished 
goods inventory levels; this strategy virtually eliminates the chance of product obso-
lescence.
The direct model simplifies the company’s operations, eliminating the need to 
support a wholesale and retail sales network, as well as cutting out the costly associ-
ated markup, and gives Dell complete control over its customer database. In addition, 
Dell can build and ship custom computers nearly as fast as a mail-order supplier can 
pull a computer out of inventory and ship it to the customer. 
To extend the benefits of its direct sales model, Dell has aggressively moved sales, 
service, and support online. Each month, the company typically has about 10 million 
unique visitors at the Dell website, where it maintains an estimated 80 country-specific 
websites. Dell’s Premier service enables companies to investigate product offerings, 
complete order forms and purchase orders, track orders in real time, and review order 
histories all online. For its small business customers, it has created an online virtual 
account executive, as well as a spare-parts ordering system and virtual help desk with 
direct access to technical support data. Dell has also continued to broaden its offerings 
beyond pure hardware product sales, adding warranty services, product integration and 
installation services, Internet access, software, and technology consulting, referring to 
them as “beyond the box” offerings. These include nearly 30,000 software and periph-
eral products from leading manufacturers that can be bundled with Dell products. 
Dell has also embraced social media. It has a corporate blog, called Direct2Dell, and 
a presence on Facebook (with over 9.6 million Likes), Pinterest (with 7 boards), and 
supply-push model 
products are made prior to 
orders received based on

Twitter (with 600,000 followers). It posts Twitter-exclusive sales for those who follow 
Dell Outlet. It also has a channel on YouTube that it calls the Dell Vlog Channel, with 
over 55,000 subscribers. In 2011, it released mobile apps for the iPhone and Android 
that featured in-app purchasing, customer ratings and reviews, product comparison, 
order tracking, a Shopping Advisor, and easy access to various customer support 
options. Dell promoted the release of the app via both a standard e-mail campaign and 
one optimized for mobile viewing, and discovered that the open rate for the mobile 
e-mail was twice that of the standard version, and the clickthrough rate was more than 
five times higher. In December 2014, it replaced its mobile website with one that uses 
responsive design, allowing the site to automatically adapt to consumers’ devices, 
driving a 50% increase in conversion rate and a 70% increase in consumer satisfaction.
In 2016, after an 18-month web platform overhaul that left its website with a cluttered 
home page that took 14 seconds to load, it revamped the site once again, focusing on 
simple navigation, fast performance, site search, and an easy way to compare multiple 
products, with a home page that now loads in just over one second, topping Internet 
Retailer’s monthly performance index in August 2016 (Internet Retailer, 2016; Evans, 
2016; Berthene, 2016b; Zaraban, 2015). 
COMMON THEMES IN ONLINE RETAILING
We have looked at some very different companies in the preceding section, from entre-
preneurial virtual merchants to established offline giants. Online retail is the fastest 
growing channel in retail commerce, has the fastest growing consumer base, and has 
growing penetration across many categories of goods. On the other hand, profits for 
many startup ventures have been difficult to achieve, and it took even Amazon eight 
years to show its first profit. 
The reasons for the difficulties experienced by many online retailers in achieving 
profits are also now clear. The path to success in any form of retail involves having a 
central location in order to attract a larger number of shoppers, charging high enough 
prices to cover the costs of goods as well as marketing, and developing highly efficient 
inventory and fulfillment systems so that the company can offer goods at lower costs 
than competitors and still make a profit. Many online merchants failed to follow these 
fundamental ideas, lowering prices below the total costs of goods and operations, failing 
to develop efficient business processes, failing to attract a large enough audience to 
their websites, and spending far too much on customer acquisition and marketing. By 
2015, the lessons of the past have been learned, and far fewer online merchants are 
selling below cost, especially if they are startup companies. There’s also been a change 
in consumer culture and attitudes. Whereas in the past consumers looked online for 
really cheap prices, in 2016, they look to online purchasing for convenience, time 
savings, and time shifting (buying retail goods at night from the sofa). Consumers 
have been willing to accept higher prices in return for the convenience of shopping 
online and avoiding the inconvenience of shopping at stores and malls. This allows 
online merchants more pricing freedom. 
A second common theme in retail e-commerce is that, for the most part, disinter-
mediation has not occurred and the retail middleman has not disappeared. Indeed, 
virtual merchants, along with powerful offline merchants who moved online, have 

maintained their powerful grip on the retail customer, with some notable exceptions 
in electronics and software. Manufacturers—with the exception of electronic goods—
have used the Web primarily as an informational resource, driving consumers to the 
traditional retail channels for transactions. Leaving Amazon aside, the most significant 
online growth has been that of offline general merchandiser giant intermediaries such 
as Walmart, Sears, Costco, JCPenney, Macy’s, Target, and Nordstrom. Many of the first-
mover, online pure-play merchants (online intermediaries) failed to achieve profit-
ability and closed their doors en masse as their venture capital funds were depleted. 
Traditional retailers have been the fast followers (although many of them cannot be 
characterized as particularly “fast”) and are most likely to succeed online by extend-
ing their traditional brands, competencies, and assets. In this sense, e-commerce 
technological innovation is following the historical pattern of other technology-driven 
commercial changes, from automobiles to radio and television, where an explosion 
of startup firms attracts significant investment, but quickly fail, and are consolidated 
into larger existing firms. 
A third theme is that in order to succeed online, established merchants need to 
create an integrated shopping environment that combines their catalog, store, and 
online experiences into one. Customers want to shop wherever they want, using any 
device, and at any time. Established retailers have significant fulfillment, inventory 
management, supply chain management, and other competencies that apply directly 
to the online channel. To succeed online, established retailers need to extend their 
brands, provide incentives to consumers to use the online channel (which given the 
same prices for goods is more efficient to operate than a physical store), avoid channel 
conflict, and build advertising campaigns using online search engines such as Google, 
Yahoo, and Bing, and shopping comparison sites. 
A fourth theme is the growth of online specialty merchants selling high-end, fashion-
able and luxury goods such as diamonds (Blue Nile), jewelry (Tiffany), and high fashion 
(Emporio Armani and Gilt Groupe) or selling discounted electronics (Best Buy), apparel 
(Gap), or office products (Office Depot). These firms are demonstrating the vitality and 
openness of the Internet for innovation and extending the range of products available 
online. Many virtual merchants have developed large, online customer bases, as well as 
the online tools required to market to their customer base. These online brands can be 
strengthened further through alliances and partnerships that add the required compe-
tencies in inventory management and fulfillment services. Virtual merchants need to 
build operational strength and efficiency before they can become profitable.
Another theme in 2016 is the continuing extraordinary growth in social commerce, 
local marketing and commerce, and mobile commerce. In the space of eight years 
since the first iPhone appeared, the mobile platform has emerged as a retail market-
ing and shopping tool, which will greatly expand e-commerce, potentially driving 
e-commerce to 20% of all commerce in the next five years. Local merchants will be a 
major benefactor of the growing mobile commerce platform. In an equally short time, 
Americans have begun to spend an increasing amount of their Internet time on social 
network sites where they share attitudes and experiences about business firms, prod-
ucts, and services. In a few years, social sites may turn into large purchasing venues. 
For instance, in October 2016, building on the increasing popularity of Facebook groups

created to buy and sell merchandise, Facebook introduced Facebook Marketplace, 
accessed from a Shop icon at the bottom of the Facebook app. Facebook Marketplace 
is a blend of social, mobile, and local C2C e-commerce intended to make it easy to 
find, buy, and sell items offered by people in your local community (Facebook, 2016).
A final theme in 2016 is the increasing use by retailers, large and small, of big 
data in their marketing efforts. The Insight on Technology case, Big Data and Predictive 
Marketing, examines this development.

THE SERVICE SECTOR: OFFLINE AND ONLINE
The service sector is typically the largest and most rapidly expanding part of the econo-
mies in advanced industrial nations such as the United States, and many European 
and some Asian countries. In the United States, the service sector (broadly defined) 
employs about four out of every five workers and accounts for about 80% of the United 
State’s gross domestic product (GDP) (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics, 2015; Bardhan, 2014). E-commerce in the service sector offers extraordinary 
opportunities to deliver information, knowledge, and transaction efficiencies.
The major service industry groups are finance, insurance, real estate, travel, pro-
fessional services such as legal and accounting, business services, health services, and 
educational services. Business services include activities such as consulting, advertis-
ing and marketing, and information processing. Within these service industry groups, 
companies can be further categorized into those that involve transaction brokering 
(acting as an intermediary to facilitate a transaction) and those that involve providing 
a “hands-on” service. For instance, one type of financial service involves stockbrokers 
who act as the middle person in a transaction between buyers and sellers. Online 
mortgage companies such as LendingTree refer customers to mortgage companies 
that actually issue the mortgage. Employment agencies put a seller of labor in contact 
with a buyer of labor. The service involved in all these examples is brokering a trans-
action.
In contrast, some industries perform specific hands-on activities for consumers. In 
order to provide their service, these professionals need to interact directly and person-
ally with the “client.” For these service industries, the opportunities for e-commerce 
are somewhat different. Currently, doctors and dentists cannot treat patients over the 
Internet. However, the Internet can assist their services by providing consumers with 
information, knowledge, and communication.
With some exceptions (for example, providers of physical services, such as clean-
ing, gardening, and so on), perhaps the most important feature of service industries 
(and occupations) is that they are knowledge- and information-intense. In order to 
provide value, service industries process a great deal of information and employ a 
highly skilled, educated workforce. For instance, to provide legal services, you need 
lawyers with law degrees. Law firms are required to process enormous amounts of 
textual information. Likewise with medical services. Financial services are not so 
knowledge-intensive, but require much larger investments in information processing 
just to keep track of transactions and investments. In fact, the financial services sector 
transaction brokering 
acting as an intermediary 
to facilitate a transaction

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
BIG DATA AND PREDICTIVE MARKETING 
Big data refers to the deluge of 
digital data that is being produced 
by the billions of people using the 
Internet, smartphones, and smart-
phones around the world, as well as an 
explosion of data from the Internet of Things. 
Estimates vary, but an IBM report claims big data 
generates 2.5 exabytes (2.5 billion gigabytes) a 
day. But big data is about more than volume; it 
is also about velocity (data comes in real-time 
torrents, loses value quickly, and requires rapid 
responses), variety (the data deluge contains both 
structured numeric data and unstructured data 
such as text documents, e-mail, video, and audio), 
variability (the flow of data is event driven and 
leads to peak loads, followed by relative calm), 
and complexity (the data comes from different 
sources and requires cleansing, matching, and 
reformatting in order to be useful). Storing all 
this data requires new kinds of database technolo-
gies and analyzing all this data involves software 
called business analytics. 
Big data is important for business because 
it can lead to better decisions and competitive 
advantages for firms that get it right. Big data 
is influencing the design and marketing of retail 
products and in-store sales efforts. Big data and 
powerful analytics programs make possible pre-
dictive marketing, the ability to send personalized 
messages to customers recommending products 
before they ask. The hope for retail firms is that 
big data will make us all into big spenders. 
Predictive marketing is not entirely new. 
Skilled salespeople have always been able to size 
up a customer and predict how much a customer 
is willing to spend, informing what they decide to 
show a customer. Predictive marketing is different 
because it is not based on traditional sales skills 
but instead on the collection of data and the use of 
software programs to maximize the likelihood of 
a sale. Predictive marketing can scale to millions 
of customers and make decisions in milliseconds. 
Big data and predictive marketing are not 
just for huge national retailers, but now can be 
used by much smaller firms as well. Stitch Fix, 
a women’s clothing retailer using a monthly sub-
scription revenue model, is one example. Stitch 
Fix blends expert styling advice, personalization 
software, and unique products to deliver an indi-
vidualized shopping experience for each of its cus-
tomers. New customers fill out a Style Profile 
online, which is then analyzed by the firm’s pro-
prietary software to identify products that the 
customer is likely to purchase. The company’s 
3,000 personal stylists interpret the output of 
the system and then handpick five clothing items 
and accessories each month that are unique to 
the customer’s taste, budget, and life style. The 
customer is not required to purchase the items 
until they have been received and accepted; the 
process to return the items is simple. 
Over time, the software keeps track of what 
the customer purchased, and learns to make better 
predictions based on what customers actually keep 
(as opposed to what they say they want, a key 
difference). The more accurately Stitch Fix can 
predict what its customers will likely buy, the more 
sales it will generate, but using analytics to better 
understand its customers also allows Stitch Fix 
to reduce its inventory costs, to adjust production 
to better meet demand, and to know its customers 
better than its competitors do.The data collected 
in the Style Profile includes basic demographic 
information, plus a photo section that depicts 
seven different styles. Customers can respond 
to each style suggestion to further differentiate 
themselves in the Stitch Fix software, which runs 
on Amazon Simple Storage Service. Customers 
can also share links to their Pinterest profiles to 
give Stitch Fix even more information.  Based on 

616	
	
C H A P T E R  9     O n l i n e  R e t a i l  a n d  S e r v i c e s 
the customer’s demographic information 
and selections of preferred styles, the software 
predicts which of several thousand products the 
customer would like.  
Stitch Fix uses its customer data in a closed 
loop to make continual improvements to its 
machine learning algorithms, which become more 
accurate as they are exposed to more customer 
data. If tweaks to the algorithm are shown to be 
more predictive, they become permanent, whereas 
changes that fail to improve the algorithm are 
discarded. The company has a team of 80 data 
scientists developing new tools and improving its 
core item selection algorithms. Eric Colson, the 
chief algorithms officer, joined the company from 
Netflix, whose recommendation engine is often 
cited as the gold standard in personalization. 
Stitch Fix’s algorithms synthesize customer feed-
back, purchase and return decisions, and profile 
information to quickly generate possible recom-
mendations. Stitch Fix stylists use these results 
to make their next selections.
For Stitch Fix, the blend of five years of 
highly granular data, cutting-edge machine 
learning, and expert human input has been a 
winning combination. The company is growing 
explosively, with industry analysts projecting 
approximately $375 million in revenue in 2016, 
a 50% increase from its $250 million earnings 
in 2015. The company is reportedly profitable 
and has not raised venture capital in two years. 
Seventy percent of its customers return within 90 
days for another fix, and 39% spend half of their 
clothing budget or more with the company. Stitch 
Fix already has five distribution centers, and the 
company is launching a service for men’s clothing 
as well as several in-house brands of clothing by 
the end of the year.
At the other end of the spectrum, Walmart, 
the world’s largest retailer, is using big data and 
predictive marketing both online and in its stores. 
Over 50% of Walmart’s web traffic comes from 
mobile devices. Walmart’s strategy is to turn 
mobile devices into shopping instruments for both 
online and offline shopping. Its mobile app gener-
ates shopping lists automatically for customers 
based on what they and other customers purchase 
each week. When the customer is in the store, a 
proximity marketing feature prompts the user to 
switch into store mode, and then customers are 
sent discounts and loyalty offers. Walmart is also 
currently building what it bills as “the world’s 
largest private cloud” to track and analyze the 
millions of transactions that take place each day in 
its stores. Walmart will use that data to automati-
cally respond to fluctuations in demand, inventory, 
and competitor activity in real-time.
Experience with big data and predictive mar-
keting in retail is still somewhat limited. There are 
many pilot projects, but little information on how 
well these systems really work for retail firms. The 
ability of big data to reverse the reduction in shop-
pers at physical retail stores that has occurred 
in the last few years is not certain. So far, there 
appears to be more data than there is analysis 
and strategy in predictive marketing. In opinion 
surveys, firms identify getting value from the data 
they have as the most challenging aspect of predic-
tive marketing. A key limitation is the scarcity of 
data scientists who can bring meaning to the data, 
and managers who can translate these results into 
sales tactics and strategies.

going to information technology equipment and services.
Services differ in the amount of personalization and customization required, 
although just about all services entail some personalization or customization. Some 
services, such as legal, medical, and accounting services, require extensive personaliza-
tion—the adjustment of a service to the precise needs of a single individual or object. 
Others, such as financial services, benefit from customization by allowing individuals 
to choose from a restricted menu. The ability of Internet and e-commerce technol-
ogy to personalize and customize service, or components of service, is a major factor 
undergirding the extremely rapid growth of e-commerce services. Future expansion 
of e-services will depend in part on the ability of e-commerce firms to transform their 
customized services—choosing from a list—into truly personalized services, such as 
providing unique advice and consultation based on a digital yet intimate understand-
ing of the client (at least as intimate as professional service providers).

ONLINE FINANCIAL SERVICES
The online financial services sector is a shining example of an e-commerce success 
story, but one with many twists and turns. While the innovative online firms such as 
E*Trade have been instrumental in transforming the brokerage industry, the impacts 
of e-commerce on the large, powerful banking, insurance, and real estate firms have 
been delayed by consumer resistance and the lack of industry innovation. For instance, 
online-only banks have not displaced traditional banks. But e-commerce has never-
theless transformed the banking and financial industries, as the major institutions 
have deployed their own online applications to service an increasingly connected 
online customer base. Insurance has become more standardized and easier to pur-
chase online. Although security is still a concern, consumers are much more willing 
to trust online sites with their financial information than in the past. Firms such as 
Mint (now owned by Intuit), SmartyPig, Credit Karma, Moven, and Simple (now owned 
by Spanish banking giant BBVA) continue to show growth. Multi-channel, established 
financial services firms—the slow followers—also continue to show gains in online 
transactions.
ONLINE FINANCIAL CONSUMER BEHAVIOR
Surveys show that consumers are attracted to financial sites and apps because of their 
desire to save time and access information rather than save money, although saving 
money is an important goal among the most sophisticated online financial households. 
Most online consumers use financial services sites and apps for mundane financial 
management, such as checking balances of existing accounts, and paying bills, most 
of which were established offline. Once accustomed to performing mundane financial 
management activities, consumers move on to more sophisticated capabilities such as 
using personal financial management tools, making loan payments, and considering 
offers from online institutions. And in the last few years, increasing investments have 

618	
	
C H A P T E R  9     O n l i n e  R e t a i l  a n d  S e r v i c e s 
been made in startup “fintech” companies that aim to unbundle traditional institutional 
financial services and instead deliver specifically targeted consumer-oriented solutions, 
often via mobile devices and apps. 
ONLINE BANKING AND BROKERAGE
NetBank and Wingspan Bank pioneered online banking in the United States in 1996 
and 1997, respectively. Although late by a year or two, the established brand-name 
national banks have taken a substantial lead in market share as the percentage of their 
customers who bank online has grown rapidly. The top banks are all large, national 
banks that also offer online banking: Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, 
and Wells Fargo. Major direct banks (those that operate without a network of branches 
or branded ATMs) include Ally Bank, EverBank, Discover Bank, Capital One 360, 
Bank of Internet USA, State Farm Bank, and USAA. These direct banks have seen 
customer deposits grow faster than regular banks, indicating their growing popular-
ity, particularly with younger customers. Several startups have also moved into the 
online banking and financial services spaces. For instance, Moven offers debit account 
services linked with online and mobile financial management tools. Simple, owned 
by Spanish bank BBVA, provides checking accounts linked to debit cards in addition 
to financial management tools. 
In 2016, over 145 million American adults (over 55% of the adult U.S. popula-
tion) are expected to use online banking, and this number is projected to grow to 162 
million (over 60%) by 2019. Over 113 million use mobile devices, with 105 million 
using a mobile phone, and 60 million using a tablet computer. While online banking 
has become a primary banking channel for all age groups, Millennials (those in the 
18- to 34-year-old group) are adopting mobile banking at a much higher rate than those 
who are older. Top mobile banking activities include checking balances and bank 
statements, transferring money from one account to another, paying bills, making 
bill payments, and depositing checks using smartphone apps that snap a photo of the 
check. Security issues still deter some. A survey by Javelin Strategy & Research found 
that about 45% of those surveyed cited security concerns as the reason why they did 
not use mobile banking services (eMarketer, Inc., 2016i, 2015a, 2015b, 2015c). 
From the bank’s perspective, online and mobile banking can provide significant 
cost savings. According to Javelin Strategy & Research, the average in-person transac-
tion at a bank branch costs $4.25, while an online transaction costs 19 cents, and a 
mobile transaction, just 10 cents (Javelin Strategy & Research, 2013). 
The history of online brokerage has been similar to that of online banking. Early 
innovators such as E*Trade have been displaced from their leadership positions in 
terms of numbers of online accounts by discount broker pioneer Charles Schwab and 
financial industry giant Fidelity (which has more mutual fund customers and more 
funds under management than any other U.S. firm).
According to one survey, about 25% of U.S. Internet users interact digitally with 
online brokerage firms (eMarketer, Inc., 2015b). The use of mobile devices and apps 
for this purpose is increasing, particularly among Millennials. According to a recent 
E*Trade survey, nearly 80% of Millennials reported using a smartphone/investing app, 

	
O n l i n e  F i n a n c i a l  S e r v i c e s 	

619
with 50% doing so more than once a week (eMarketer, Inc., 2015d, 2015e, 2015f).  The 
most frequent activities conducted on mobile devices include monitoring one’s port-
folio and the market, getting stock quotes, placing and checking on orders, and doing 
general financial research. The top trading website among U.S. Internet users in 2016 
is Fidelity Investments, with around 6.9 million monthly unique visitors (see Table 
9.6). The major online brokerage firms are investing significantly in search engine 
marketing, and are among the biggest spenders in the paid search market. They are 
also increasingly using social media to engage with customers, although they must 
be careful to comply with all regulations and rules as they do so. For instance, some 
brokerage firms use Twitter to deliver commentary, company information, marketing, 
and customer service. A new wave of online financial advisors, sometimes referred 
to as robo-advisors, offer inexpensive automated investment management tools and 
advice. Examples of companies that have attracted venture capital interest include 
Betterment (valued at over $700 million, and managing almost $4 billion assets for 
around 150,000 customers as of 2016), Wealthfront, and Personal Capital Corp. Similar 
services are also offered by major online brokerage firms such as Vanguard and Schwab. 
Multi-Channel vs. Pure Online Financial Services Firms
Online consumers prefer to visit financial services sites that have physical outlets or 
branches. In general, multi-channel financial services firms that have both physical 
branches or offices and solid online offerings are growing faster than pure-online 
firms that have no physical presence, and they are assuming market leadership as 
well. Traditional banking firms have literally thousands of branches where customers 
can open accounts, deposit money, take out loans, find home mortgages, and rent a 
safety deposit box. Top online brokerage firms do not have the same physical foot-
print as the banks do, but each has a strong physical presence or telephone presence 
to strengthen its online presence. Fidelity has walk-in service center branches, but it 
relies primarily on the telephone for interacting with investors. Charles Schwab has 
investment centers around the country as an integral part of its online strategy. Pure-

online banks and brokerages cannot provide customers with some services that still 
require a face-to-face interaction.
Financial Portals and Account Aggregators
Financial portals are sites that provide consumers with comparison shopping ser-
vices, independent financial advice, and financial planning. Independent portals do 
not themselves offer financial services, but act as steering mechanisms to online 
providers. They generate revenue from advertising, referral fees, and subscription 
fees. For example, Yahoo’s financial portal, Yahoo Finance, offers consumers the 
ability to track their stock portfolio, market overviews, real-time stock quotes, news, 
financial advice, and streaming video interviews with financial leaders. Other inde-
pendent financial portals include Intuit’s Quicken, MSN’s MSN Money, and 
CNNMoney. A host of financial portal sites have sprung up to help consumers with 
financial management and planning such as Mint (owned by Intuit), SmartyPig, and 
Credit Karma. 
Account aggregation is the process of pulling together all of a customer’s finan-
cial (and even nonfinancial) data at a single personalized website, including brokerage, 
banking, insurance, loans, frequent flyer miles, personalized news, and much more. 
For example, a consumer can see his or her TD Ameritrade brokerage account, Fidel-
ity 401(k) account, Travelers Insurance annuity account, and American Airlines fre-
quent flyer miles all displayed on a single site. The idea is to provide consumers with 
a holistic view of their entire portfolio of assets, no matter what financial institution 
actually holds those assets.
The leading provider of account aggregation technology is Envestnet Yodlee. It 
uses screen-scraping and other techniques to pull information from 14,000 different 
data sources. A smart-mapping technology is also used so that if the underlying web-
sites change, the scraping software can adapt and still find the relevant information. 
Today, Envestnet Yodlee is used by over 1,000 leading financial institutions and com-
panies, including 11 of the 20 largest U.S. banks, and this network reaches more than 
100 million end users (Envestnet Yodlee, 2016).
ONLINE MORTGAGE AND LENDING SERVICES
During the early days of e-commerce, hundreds of firms launched pure-play online 
mortgage sites to capture the U.S. home mortgage market. Early entrants hoped to 
radically simplify and transform the traditional mortgage value chain process, dramati-
cally speed up the loan closing process, and share the economies with consumers by 
offering lower rates.
By 2003, over half of these early-entry, pure-online firms had failed. Early pure-
play online mortgage institutions had difficulties developing a brand name at an 
affordable price and failed to simplify the mortgage generation process. They ended 
up suffering from high start-up and administrative costs, high customer acquisition 
costs, rising interest rates, and poor execution of their strategies.
Despite this rocky start, the online mortgage market is slowly growing; it is domi-
nated by established online banks and other online financial services firms, traditional 
mortgage vendors, and a few successful online mortgage firms.

Many mortgage shoppers research mortgages online, but few actually apply online 
because of the complexity of mortgages. Most mortgages today are written by inter-
mediary mortgage brokers, with banks still playing an important origination role but 
generally not servicing mortgages they originate. 
Although online mortgage originations currently represent a small percentage of 
all mortgages, their number is expected to continue to grow slowly but surely over 
the next several years. In November 2015, Intuit’s Quicken Loans introduced Rocket 
Mortgage, which allows borrowers to be fully approved for a mortgage in under ten 
minutes. The applicant only needs to provide a few details, such as birth date, social 
security number, and home address, and then Rocket Mortgage uses that data to 
automatically obtain various types of information without the need for the borrower 
to manually provide any further documentation. The system then displays various 
loan options, and once the borrower selects one, all necessary documents (except for 
final closing documents) can be signed online using a secure portal (Prevost, 2015).
Consumer benefits from online mortgages include reduced application times, 
market interest rate intelligence, and process simplification that occurs when par-
ticipants in the mortgage process (title, insurance, and lending companies) share a 
common information base. Mortgage lenders benefit from the cost reduction involved 
in online processing of applications, while charging rates marginally lower than tra-
ditional bricks-and-mortar institutions.
Nevertheless, the online mortgage industry has not transformed the process of 
obtaining a mortgage. A significant brake on market expansion is the complexity of 
the mortgage process, which requires physical signatures and documents, multiple 
institutions, and complex financing details—such as closing costs and points—that are 
difficult for shoppers to compare across vendors. Nevertheless, as in other areas, the 
ability of shoppers to find low mortgage rates online has helped reduce the fees and 
interest rates charged by traditional mortgage lenders. Online lending services have also 
become popular. The biggest online lenders include Lending Club, which went public in 
December 2014, but has faced diminishing returns in 2016, Prosper (a peer-to-peer loan 
marketplace), and Social Finance Inc. (SoFi), which focuses primarily on student loans.
ONLINE INSURANCE SERVICES
In 1995, the price of a $500,000 20-year term life policy for a healthy 40-year-old male 
was $995 a year. In 2016, the same policy could be had for around $345—a decline of 
about 65%—while other prices have risen 15% in the same period. In a study of the 
term life insurance business, Brown and Goolsbee discovered that Internet usage led 
to an 8%–15% decline in term life insurance prices industry-wide (both offline and 
online), and increased consumer surplus by about $115 million per year (and hence 
reduced industry profits by the same amount) (Brown and Goolsbee, 2000). Price 
dispersion for term life policies initially increased, but then fell as more and more 
people began using the Internet to obtain insurance quotes.
Unlike books and CDs, where online price dispersion is higher than offline, and 
in many cases online prices are higher than offline, term life insurance stands out as 
one product group supporting the conventional wisdom that the Internet will lower 
search costs, increase price comparison, and lower prices to consumers. Term life

insurance is a commodity product, however, and in other insurance product lines, 
the Web offers insurance companies new opportunities for product and service dif-
ferentiation and price discrimination.
The insurance industry forms a major part of the financial services sector. It has 
four major segments: automobile, life, health, and property and casualty. Insurance 
products can be very complex. For example, there are many different types of non-
automotive property and casualty insurance: liability, fire, homeowners, commercial, 
workers’ compensation, marine, accident, and other lines such as vacation insurance. 
Writing an insurance policy in any of these areas is very information-intense, often 
necessitating personal inspection of the properties, and it requires considerable actu-
arial experience and data. The life insurance industry has also developed life insur-
ance policies that defy easy comparison and can only be explained and sold by an 
experienced sales agent. Historically, the insurance industry has relied on thousands 
of local insurance offices and agents to sell complex products uniquely suited to the 
circumstances of the insured person and the property. Complicating the insurance 
marketplace is the fact that the insurance industry is not federally regulated, but rather 
is regulated by 50 different state insurance commissions that are strongly influenced 
by local insurance agents. Before a website can offer quotations on insurance, it must 
obtain a license to enter the insurance business in all the states where it provides 
quotation services or sells insurance.
Like the online mortgage industry, the online insurance industry has been very 
successful in attracting visitors who are looking to obtain prices and terms of insurance 
policies. While many national insurance underwriting companies initially did not offer 
competitive products directly online because it might injure the business operations of 
their traditional local agents, the websites of almost all of the major firms now provide 
the ability to obtain an online quote. Even if consumers do not actually purchase 
insurance policies online, the Internet has proven to have a powerful influence on 
consumer insurance decisions by dramatically reducing search costs and changing the 
price discovery process. According to a 2015 survey, over 70% of American consumers 
looked for life insurance information online, with 30% indicating that the Internet was 
their most valuable source of information. However, consumers also continue to rely 
on financial advisors as well for advice, with over half seeking information from both 
sources (LIMRA, 2015). Another survey found that nearly 2 in 3 consumers who own a 
mobile device said they already have or plan to use those devices to access services to 
their life insurance policies (LIMRA, 2014a). Other forms of insurance are more likely 
to be purchased online. For instance, according to a 2015 comScore study, the online 
channel continues to be consumers’ preferred method for shopping for auto insurance 
policies, with over 70% of shoppers getting an online quote (comScore, 2015). Insur-
ance companies are also making increased use of social media. For instance, a LIMRA 
survey found that over 90% of life insurance companies had social media programs, 
up from 60% in 2010. Facebook and LinkedIn are the most popular platforms, both 
used by over 90% (LIMRA, 2014b). All of the major insurers, such as GEICO, Allstate, 
State Farm, Progressive, and Travelers, have a significant online presence. Some of the 
leading online insurance services companies include InsWeb, Insure.com, Insurance.
com, QuickQuote, and NetQuote.

ONLINE REAL ESTATE SERVICES
During the early days of e-commerce, real estate seemed ripe for an Internet revo-
lution that would rationalize this historically local, complex, and local agent-driven 
industry that monopolized the flow of consumer information. Potentially, the Inter-
net and e-commerce might have disintermediated this huge marketspace, allowing 
buyers and sellers, renters and owners, to transact directly, lower search costs to 
near zero, and dramatically reduce prices. However, this did not happen. What did 
happen is extremely beneficial to buyers and sellers, as well as to real estate agents. 
At one point, there were an estimated 100,000 real estate sites on the Internet world-
wide. Many of these sites have disappeared. However, the remaining online sites 
have started to make headway toward transforming the industry. In addition, most 
local real estate brokers in the United States have their own agency websites to deal 
with clients, in addition to participating with thousands of other agencies in multiple 
listing services that list homes online. Some of the major online real estate sites are 
Realtor.com and its parent, Move.com (now owned by global media giant News Corp.), 
Zillow and Trulia (now owned by the same company), HomeGain, ZipRealty, Craig-
slist, and Redfin. Zillow and Trulia together account for over 35% of all desktop and 
mobile visits to real estate sites in 2016, while Realtor.com attracts about 12% of traffic 
(Hitwise, 2016). 
Real estate differs from other types of online financial services because it is impos-
sible to complete a property transaction online. Clearly, the major impact of Internet 
real estate sites is in influencing offline decisions. The Internet has become a com-
pelling method for real estate professionals, homebuilders, property managers and 
owners, and ancillary service providers to communicate with and provide information 
to consumers. According to the National Association of Realtors, the first step in the 
home buying process for nearly all ages of home buyers was to look online. Websites 
were the most common information source, used by almost 90%, while mobile sites 
and apps and mobile search were each also used by over 50%. At the same time, 87% 
also used the services of a real estate agent (National Association of Realtors, 2016). 
The primary service offered by real estate sites is a listing of houses available. 
In 2016, Realtor.com, the official site of the National Association of Realtors, listed 
over 3 million homes and had around 40 million unique users across desktop and 
mobile devices in April 2016 (Feeney, 2016). Listings typically feature detailed property 
descriptions, multiple photographs, and virtual 360-degree tours. Consumers can link to 
mortgage lenders, credit reporting agencies, house inspectors, and surveyors. There are 
also online loan calculators, appraisal reports, sales price histories by neighborhood, 
school district data, crime reports, and social and historical information on neighbor-
hoods. Some online real estate brokers now charge substantially less than traditional 
offline brokers who typically charge 6% of the sale price. They can do this because the 
buyers (and in some cases, the sellers) do much of the work of traditional real estate 
agents, such as prospecting, choosing neighborhoods, and identifying houses of inter-
est prior to contacting an online agent. For instance, Move (the parent company of 
Realtor.com) also offers a “Find a Neighborhood” feature that allows users to choose the 
type of neighborhood they want to live in by weighing factors such as the quality (and 

624	
	
C H A P T E R  9     O n l i n e  R e t a i l  a n d  S e r v i c e s 
tax costs) of schools, age of the population, number of families with children nearby, 
and available social and recreational services. Move also offers mobile apps for the 
iPad and iPhone, Android, and Windows phones. For instance, the Area Scout function 
allows users to see the list prices of all homes in a neighborhood on the street level. 
Despite the revolution in available information, there has not been a revolution 
in the industry value chain. Online listings are provided by local multiple listing ser-
vices supported by local real estate agents. Sometimes, addresses of the houses are 
not available, and online users are directed to the local listing agent who is hired by 
the seller. Traditional hands-on real estate brokers will show the house and handle all 
transactions with the owner to preserve their fees, typically ranging from 5% to 6% 
of the transaction.

ONLINE TRAVEL SERVICES
Online travel is one of the most successful B2C e-commerce segments, and accounts 
for almost one-third of all U.S. B2C ecommerce revenues in 2016. The Internet has 
become the most common channel used by consumers to research travel options, seek 
the best possible prices, and book reservations for airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental 
cars, cruises, and tours. Today, more travel is booked online than offline. In 2016, about 
138 million (64% of all U.S. Internet users) are expected to research travel and about 
115 million will book travel online. Online travel services revenues are expected to 
reach over $180 billion in 2016, and continue growing to over $213 billion by 2020 (see 
Figure 9.5) (eMarketer, Inc., 2016j, 2016k). 
WHY ARE ONLINE TRAVEL SERVICES SO POPULAR?
Online travel sites offer consumers a one-stop, convenient, leisure and business travel 
experience where travelers can find content (descriptions of vacations and facilities), 
community (chat groups and bulletin boards), commerce (purchase of all travel ele-
ments), and customer service (usually through call centers). Online sites offer much 
more information and many more travel options than traditional travel agents. For 
suppliers—the owners of hotels, rental cars, and airlines—the online sites aggregate 
millions of consumers into singular, focused customer pools that can be efficiently 
reached through on-site advertising and promotions. Online sites create a much more 
efficient marketplace, bringing consumers and suppliers together in a low-transaction 
cost environment.
Travel services are an ideal service for the Internet, and therefore e-commerce 
business models work well for this product. Travel is an information-intensive product 
requiring significant consumer research. It is a digital product in the sense that travel 
requirements—planning, researching, comparison shopping, reserving, and payment—
can be accomplished for the most part online in a digital environment. On the travel 
reservation side, travel does not require any “inventory”: there are no physical assets. 
And the suppliers of the product—owners of hotels, airlines, rental cars, vacation 
rooms, and tour guides—are highly fragmented and often have excess capacity. Always 

	
O n l i n e  T r a v e l  S e r v i c e s

looking for customers to fill vacant rooms and rent idle cars, suppliers will be anxious 
to lower prices and willing to advertise on websites that can attract millions of con-
sumers. The online intermediaries—such as Travelocity, Expedia, and others—do not 
have to deploy thousands of travel agents in physical offices across the country but 
can instead concentrate on a single interface with a national consumer audience. 
Travel services do not require the kind of expensive multi-channel “physical presence” 
strategy required of financial services (although they generally operate centralized 
call centers to provide personal customer service). Therefore, travel services “scale” 
better, permitting earnings to grow faster than costs. But these efficiencies also make 
it hard for reservation sites to make a profit.
THE ONLINE TRAVEL MARKET
There are four major sectors in the travel market: airline tickets, hotel reservations, 
car rentals, and travel packages. Airline tickets are the source of the greatest amount 
of revenue in online travel. Airline reservations are largely a commodity. They can 
be easily described online. The same is true with car rentals; most people can reliably 
rent a car over the phone or online and expect to obtain what they ordered. Although 
hotels are somewhat more difficult to describe, hotel branding, supplemented by 
websites that include descriptions, photographs, and virtual tours, typically provides 
enough information to most consumers to allow them to feel as if they know what they

are purchasing, making them comfortable enough to make hotel reservations online. 
Travel packages purchased online constituted the smallest percentage of travel sales.
Increasingly, corporations are outsourcing their travel offices entirely to vendors 
who can provide web-based solutions, high-quality service, and lower costs. Online 
vendors to corporations provide corporate online booking solutions (COBS) that 
provide integrated airline, hotel, conference center, and auto rental services at a single 
site.
ONLINE TRAVEL INDUSTRY DYNAMICS
Because much of what travel agency sites offer is a commodity, and thus they face 
the same costs, competition among online providers is intense. Price competition 
is difficult because shoppers, as well as online site managers, can comparison shop 
easily. Therefore, competition among sites tends to focus on scope of offerings, ease 
of use, payment options, and personalization. Some well-known travel sites are listed 
in Table 9.7.
The online travel services industry has gone through a period of intense consolida-
tion. Expedia now owns Travelocity, Orbitz, CheapTickets, Hotels.com, Hotwire, and 
meta-search engine Trivago, giving it a 75% market share among U.S. online travel 
agencies. Its primary competition consists of Priceline, which owns Booking.com, 
Lowestfare.com, and Kayak. Together, Expedia and Priceline control a whopping 95% 
of the online travel agency booking market. However, Google is also poised to become 
corporate online

hotel, conference center, 
and auto rental services at 
a single site

a player in the market, with its Google Flights and Google Hotel Finder that also 
provide booking functionality. The U.S. Department of Justice also cited the TripAdvi-
sor’s introduction of an Instant Booking service as a factor in its approval of Expedia’s 
acquisition of Orbitz. 
In addition to industry consolidation, the online travel industry has been roiled 
by meta-search engines that scour the Web for the best prices on travel and lodging, 
and then collect finder or affiliate fees for sending consumers to the lowest-price sites. 
Travel aggregator sites include Trivago, Kayak, Fly.com, and Mobissimo. These sites, 
in the eyes of many industry leaders, commoditize the online travel industry even 
further, cause excessive price competition, and divert revenues from the leading, 
branded firms who have made extensive investments in inventory and systems.
Mobile devices and apps used for pre-trip planning, booking, check-in, and context 
and location-based destination information are also transforming the online travel 
industry. For instance, in 2016, about 75 million people are expected to use a mobile 
device to research travel. Around 59 million are expected to actually book travel using 
a mobile device in 2016. Smartphones are used slightly more than tablets to both 
research and book travel (eMarketer, Inc., 2016l, 2016m). Most of the major airlines 
now have apps for a variety of mobile platforms to enable flight research, booking, 
and management. Apps from hotels and car rental companies are available from most 
of the major players such as Hertz and Avis for car rentals, and Best Western, Choice 
Hotels, Hilton, and Starwood for hotels. Apps may sometimes target specific consumer 
behavior. For instance, Expedia reports that 25% of its mobile hotel sales are made 
at properties within 10 miles of the user’s current location, indicating that they are 
searching for and booking rooms on-the-go, as they travel. Mobile devices are also 
proving to be quite popular for booking at the last minute. Marriott says that 35% of 
its smartphone bookings are for same-day travel (eMarketer, Inc., 2014). 
Social media is also having a big impact on the online travel industry. User-gener-
ated content and online reviews are having an increasing influence on travel-buying 
decisions. The Insight on Society case, Phony Reviews, examines some of the issues this 
presents for the industry.

ONLINE CAREER SERVICES
Next to travel services, one of the Internet’s most successful online services has been 
job services (recruitment sites) that provide a free posting of individual resumes, plus 
many other related career services; for a fee, they also list job openings posted by 
companies. Career services sites collect revenue from other sources as well, by provid-
ing value-added services to users and collecting fees from related service providers. 
The online job market is dominated by two large players: Monster, with about 17 
million unique monthly visitors, and CareerBuilder, with about 14 million. Job listing 
aggregators, such as Indeed and SimplyHired, both owned by a Japanese-based human 
resources company, and Glassdoor, which also posts anonymous online reviews of 
companies by their employees, are also very popular. The social network site LinkedIn

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
PHONY REVIEWS
People used to rely on travel agents 
for professional recommendations 
about travel destinations, hotels, and 
restaurants to choose while on vacation. 
Today, however, sites like TripAdvisor and 
Yelp have taken over that function. Trip­Advisor 
has been a smashing success, with more than 385 
million user-generated reviews, $1.5 billion in 
revenue, and 108 million members. Yelp has 70 
million reviews of restaurants and other services, 
and a market capitalization of almost $3 billion. 
The sites have become trusted sources for travelers 
as they try to decide where to travel, what hotels to 
book, and where to eat. A good rating can be worth 
thousands of dollars in bookings. But are all those 
reviews for real? Can they be trusted? 
Although the majority of reviews on TripAdvi-
sor, Yelp, and related sites are trustworthy and 92% 
of buyers make decisions based on online reviews, 
fraudulent reviews are commonplace. Hotels pay 
people to create false identities and post favorable 
reviews on their properties, a practice known as 
“astroturfing,” and also to slam competing venues. 
A disgruntled customer with an axe to grind can 
severely damage the reputation of a small business. 
Businesses can also tarnish their reputations by 
mishandling bad reviews, phony or otherwise. An 
Arizona bakery went viral in 2013 after an unflat-
tering appearance on a reality show drew nega-
tive social media attention. The bakery’s owners 
used Facebook, Yelp, and Reddit to make personal 
attacks against anyone who had posted a negative 
review and quickly gained unwanted notoriety. In 
2014, a British hotel fined two guests after they 
made a scathing review on TripAdvisor, but after 
local media scrutiny, the hotel refunded the money 
and vowed to improve its services. 
Travel sites received additional legal backing 
in 2016, when the House of Representatives passed 
a bill that bars businesses from forbidding negative 
reviews in their customer agreements. The Senate 
passed a similar bill in 2015, so it will likely become 
law in 2017. Additionally, a federal appeals court 
ruled in 2016 that Yelp wasn’t liable for negative 
reviews posted on its site about a Washington state 
locksmith. However, in a separate case, a state 
court ruled against Yelp in 2014 and demanded the 
removal of critical posts about a law firm. Even in 
that case, the Supreme Court is expected to over-
turn the ruling in 2016.
Although most of these recent rulings empower 
their users to continue posting honest reviews, even 
if they are negative, the prevalence of phony reviews 
still presents a considerable challenge both for busi-
nesses and for TripAdvisor and Yelp. Few of these 
sites verify the identities of their reviewers, which 
frustrates businesses. In response, restaurants and 
other retail businesses are trying to popularize the 
hashtag #noreceiptnoreview, where reviewers post 
receipts to verify that they were, in fact, customers 
of the businesses they’re reviewing, while retaining 
a semblance of anonymity. Businesses also bemoan 
the fact that while a majority of customers use 
online reviews before making a purchase or travel 
decision, a very small minority post reviews. One 
study of adults in the U.K. found that only 11% 
of travelers reported posting reviews with any fre-
quency. As a result, a few bad eggs in the vocal 
minority can have a dramatic effect on the well-
being of a business, even if most customers are 
satisfied.
The authenticity of reviews is critically impor-
tant to the success of Yelp and TripAdvisor, but gar-
nering a high review score is equally important to 
the businesses listed on the site. Studies have found 
that if a business can increase its Yelp rating by one 
star, its revenues will increase anywhere from 5% 
to 9%, and in March 2014, an industry study found 

that small businesses using Yelp experienced annual 
revenue increases of $8,000. This gives businesses 
ample incentive to post phony reviews praising their 
own business and slamming their competitors. In 
2015, approximately 25% of Yelp reviews are 
labeled suspicious or not recommended.  With this 
in mind, Yelp continues to develop ways to remove 
suspect reviews, including those from rings of busi-
nesses who work together to fraudulently increase 
the ratings of each business in the group.  
Both Yelp and TripAdvisor use algorithms to 
automate the identification and removal of phony 
reviews. Yelp generates notices called Consumer 
Alerts to inform readers when a review is likely 
fraudulent, while TripAdvisor employs a team of 
experts to analyze the integrity of reviews. Nev-
ertheless, these sites have plenty of incentive to 
downplay the extent of their phony review prob-
lems. TripAdvisor has been fined multiple times by 
regulatory agencies for misrepresenting the authen-
ticity of its reviews, including $610,000 in Italy in 
2014 and $484,000 in France in 2011, and the 
FTC has received well over 2,000 complaints from 
businesses about Yelp from 2008 to 2014. 
In 2015, researchers from Harvard Business 
School mined and analyzed reviews from these 
sites to get a better understanding of what makes 
a review suspicious. Truthful reviewers tend to talk 
about specific details, while the fraudulent review-
ers, not surprisingly, tended to talk more about 
themselves, reasons for the trip, and traveling com-
panions, lacking actual experience with the venue. 
Positive review fraud is driven by sudden 
dips in reputation, and negative review fraud 
is driven by changing patterns in competition, 
like a new restaurant in the area. Most fraudulent 
reviews are either one or five stars, with very few 
in between, and fraudulent reviews of chain res-
taurants are very rare, since these companies are 
likelier to have sophisticated marketing and brand-
ing efforts that go well beyond online review sites. 
Will this improved understanding of fraudulent 
reviews clean up TripAdvisor and Yelp once and for 
all? Probably not. But review sites and regulators 
are cracking down on phony reviews with increasing 
vigor. In 2013, for instance, 19 companies received 
fines from New York regulators totaling $350,000 
for buying and selling fraudulent reviews, and in 
2015 Yelp sued a company operating multiple 
businesses involved in selling fraudulent reviews 
to restaurants. Amazon is also riddled with phony 
reviews, and the company has taken legal action 
against over a thousand individual users for posting 
fake reviews.
Despite all of the uncertainty surrounding 
phony and negative reviews, it might be the case 
that TripAdvisor and Yelp are actually improving 
service at hotels and restaurants. In Ireland, for 
example, reviews of hotels improved from 3.6 to 
3.8 in 2014, but this was attributable to corre-
sponding improvements in service, not fraud. The 
best approach is still to take what you read with 
a grain of salt, discarding both the overwhelmingly 
positive and the unrelentingly negative reviews.

has also become an increasingly important player in this market (see the opening 
case in Chapter 11).
Traditionally, companies have relied on five employee recruitment tools: classified 
and print advertising, career expos (or trade shows), on-campus recruiting, private 
employment agencies (now called “staffing firms”), and internal referral programs. 
In comparison to online recruiting, these tools have severe limitations. Print adver-
tising usually includes a per-word charge that limits the amount of detail employers 
provide about a job opening, as well as a limited time period within which the job is 
posted. Career expos do not allow for pre-screening of attendees and are limited by the 
amount of time a recruiter can spend with each candidate. Staffing firms charge high 
fees and have a limited, usually local, selection of job hunters. On-campus recruiting 
also restricts the number of candidates a recruiter can speak with during a normal visit 
and requires that employers visit numerous campuses. And internal referral programs 
may encourage employees to propose unqualified candidates for openings in order to 
qualify for rewards or incentives offered.
Online recruiting overcomes these limitations, providing a more efficient and 
cost-effective means of linking employers and potential employees, while reducing the 
total time to hire. Online recruiting enables job hunters to more easily build, update, 
and distribute their resumes while gathering information about prospective employers 
and conducting job searches.
IT’S JUST INFORMATION: THE IDEAL WEB BUSINESS?
Online recruitment is ideally suited for the Web. The hiring process is an information-
intense business process that involves discovering the skills and salary requirements 
of individuals and matching them with available jobs. In order to accomplish this 
matchup, there does not initially need to be face-to-face interaction, or a great deal 
of personalization. Prior to the Internet, this information sharing was accomplished 
locally by human networks of friends, acquaintances, former employers, and rela-
tives, in addition to employment agencies that developed paper files on job hunters. 
The Internet can clearly automate this flow of information, reducing search time and 
costs for all parties. 
Table 9.8 lists some of the most popular recruitment sites.
Why are so many job hunters and employers using Internet job sites? Recruitment 
sites are popular largely because they save time and money for both job hunters and 
employers seeking recruits. For employers, the job boards expand the geographical 
reach of their searches, lower costs, and result in faster hiring decisions.
For job seekers, online sites are popular not only because their resumes can 
be made widely available to recruiters but also because of a variety of other related 
job-hunting services. The services delivered by online recruitment sites have greatly 
expanded since their emergence in 1996. Originally, online recruitment sites just 
provided a digital version of newspaper classified ads. Today’s sites offer many other 
services, including skills assessment, personality assessment questionnaires, person-
alized account management for job hunters, organizational culture assessments, job 
search tools, employer blocking (prevents your employer from seeing your posting), 

	
O n l i n e  C a r e e r  S e r v i c e s

employee blocking (prevents your employees from seeing your listings if you are their 
employer), and e-mail notification. Online sites also provide a number of educational 
services such as resume writing advice, software skills preparation, and interview tips.
For the most part, online recruitment sites work, in the sense of linking job 
hunters with jobs, but they are just one of many ways people actually find jobs. A 
survey by The Conference Board found that the majority (70%) of job seekers rely 
equally on both the Internet and newspapers to look for jobs, with about half relying 
on word-of-mouth leads, and about a quarter on employment agencies. Given that the 
cost of posting a resume online is zero, the marginal returns are very high.

The ease with which resumes can be posted online has also raised new issues for 
both job recruiters and job seekers. If you are an employer, how do you sort through 
the thousands of resumes you may receive when posting an open job? If you are a job 
seeker, how do you stand out among the thousands or even millions of others? Perhaps 
one way is to post a video resume. In a survey by Vault, nearly nine in 10 employers 
said they would watch a video resume if it were submitted to them, in part because it 
would help them better assess a candidate’s professional presentation and demeanor, 
and over half said they believed video would become a common addition to future 
job applications. CareerBuilder became the first major online job site to implement a 
video resume tool for job candidates, following a previous launch for an online video 
brand-building tool for employers.
Perhaps one of the most important functions of online recruitment sites is not so 
much their capacity to actually match employers with job hunters but their ability to 
establish market prices and terms, as well as trends in the labor market. Online recruit-
ment sites identify salary levels for both employers and job hunters and categorize the 
skill sets required to achieve those salary levels. In this sense, online recruitment sites 
are online national marketplaces that establish the terms of trade in labor markets. 
The existence of online national job sites should lead to a rationalization of wages, 
greater labor mobility, and higher efficiency in recruitment and operations because 
employers will be able to quickly find the people they need.
ONLINE RECRUITMENT INDUSTRY TRENDS
Trends for 2016–2017 in the online recruitment services industry include the following:
•	 Social recruiting: According to a recent survey of over 1,600 recruiters and human 
resource professionals, 87% use social recruiting, with LinkedIn being a primary 
resource (Jobvite, 2015). LinkedIn, probably the most well-known business-oriented 
social network, has grown significantly to over 450 million members representing 
over 170 different industries in over 200 countries as of October 2016. LinkedIn’s 
corporate hiring solutions are used by over 90 of the Fortune 100 companies, and 
more than 3 million companies have a LinkedIn page. Consumers are using sites 
such as LinkedIn to establish business contacts and networks. For instance, accord-
ing to LinkedIn, its members do almost 6 billion professionally-oriented searches 
on LinkedIn a year. Employers are also using LinkedIn to conduct searches to find 
potential job candidates that may not be actively job hunting. For instance, LinkedIn 
offers companies a feature called LinkedIn Talent Solutions that includes tools that 
help corporate recruiters find “passive talent” (people who are not actively looking 
for a new job), as well as custom company profiles that are specifically designed 
for recruitment. According to LinkedIn Talent Solutions, U.S. company reliance on 
social recruiting to find quality employees has increased by over 50% since 2011, 
with 44% of those surveyed indicating that social recruiting was the most important 
source for key positions (LinkedIn Talent Solutions, 2016). Social network sites are 
also being used by employers to “check up” on the background of job candidates. A 
study by Harris Interactive of over 2,000 managers and human resource employees 

	
O n - d e m a n d  S e r v i c e  C o m p a n i e s 	

633
found that over 60% are using social networks to screen job candidates, and almost 
50% have rejected candidates because of content on a social site. Employers typi-
cally search Facebook, Twitter, and Linked­In. Provocative or inappropriate photos 
were the biggest negative factor followed by drinking and drug references. However, 
on the flip side, recruiters also noted that not having any online presence at all also 
hurts candidates, with more than a third indicating that they would be less likely to 
interview a job candidate if they cannot find information about that person online 
(Careerbuilder, 2016). 
•	 Mobile: As with other forms of services, career services firms have also moved onto 
the mobile platform. A recent survey found that mobile devices were the primary 
devices used by Millennials and Gen X to search for jobs (eMarketer, Inc., 2015g). 
To reach this audience, CareerBuilder, Monster, LinkedIn, and most of the other 
major sites all have a mobile website, as well as apps that allow job seekers to create 
and upload resumes, search jobs by keyword, location, and company, e-mail jobs, 
browse and apply, and more. LinkedIn’s app, for instance, can also recommend 
jobs based on data you provide on your profile page. In 2016, mobile accounts for 
about 55% of the unique members visiting LinkedIn. 
•	 Job search engines/aggregators: As with travel services, search engines that 
focus specifically on jobs are posing a new threat to established online career sites. 
For instance, Indeed, SimplyHired, and Us.jobs “scrape” listings from thousands of 
online job sites such as Monster, CareerBuilder, specialty recruiting services, and 
the sites of individual employers to provide a free, searchable index of thousands 
of job listings in one spot. Because these firms do not charge employers a listing 
fee, they are currently using a pay-per-click or other advertising revenue model.
•	 Data analytics and algorithms: Companies are increasingly using big data tech-
nologies in the hiring process, as well as adaptive algorithms that help them match 
job seekers to job openings. 
•	 Hiring by algorithm: Companies are increasingly using algorithms to sift online 
job applications, focusing on key words to match job seekers with jobs.

ON-DEMAND SERVICE COMPANIES
On-demand service companies provide a platform that enables the on-demand deliv-
ery of various services, by connecting providers (“sellers”) who wish to exploit their 
“spare” resources, such as cars, rooms with beds, and ability to perform various services 
via their personal labor, with consumers (“buyers”) who would like to utilize those 
resources and services. Other common phrases sometimes used to describe these 
online businesses are “sharing economy,” “collaborative commerce,” “peer to peer 
consumption,” “mesh economy,” and “we-commerce.” However, unlike traditional 
sharing where there is no fee charged in the transaction, these firms collect a fee from 
both sellers and buyers for using their platforms. In the last few years, hundreds of 
startups have created a plethora of such platforms that allow owners of resources that 

634	
	
C H A P T E R  9     O n l i n e  R e t a i l  a n d  S e r v i c e s 
are underutilized to sell access to those resources to consumers who would prefer not 
to, or are unable to, buy those resources themselves.
A number of these on-demand service firms have grown exponentially over the 
last five years. Table 9.9 describes just a few of the hundreds of firms whose busi-
ness model is to provide transaction platforms that enable the on-demand delivery 
of various services. See the Insight on Business case, Food on Demand: Instacart and 
GrubHub, for a look at two of these companies focused on the delivery of food on 
demand. 
Collaborative commerce, trading platforms, and peer-to-peer commerce are not 
new. While eBay involves the sale of items at auction or for fixed prices, on-demand 
service firms provide sell access to cars, room, spaces, and even skilled people. What 
is new about these firms is their use of mobile and Internet technology to enable 
transactions on their platforms. This is especially true of the car and lodging services 
where transactions are local and mobile. Second, the growth of these firms is supported 
by the use of online reputation systems based on peer review, to establish a trusted 
environment where sellers and consumers can feel confident transacting with one 
another. Online peer review of both the providers and the consumers helps to ensure 
that both parties have acceptable reputations, and that a high quality of service is pro-
vided. These firms have learned from eBay and Netflix the importance of peer reviews 
and ratings. A third factor is that successful firms lower the cost of services like urban 
transportation, lodging, office space, and personal errand services. Firms that can do 
this are highly disruptive of existing firms and business models. 
Uber and Airbnb are among the most successful and well-known on-demand 
service companies. See the opening case in Chapter 1 for a description of Uber and 
an in-depth discussion of the issues that this business model raises. 
Airbnb was founded in 2008 as a way to find lodging for attendees at a business 
convention. Since then, Airbnb has expanded to the entire lodging marketplace, and

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
FOOD ON DEMAND: INSTACART AND GRUBHUB 
It seems as if, every day, a new on-
demand service company pops up 
that describes itself as the “Uber” of 
something. These types of businesses 
are relatively easy to create, requiring 
only a robust and easy-to-use app platform 
where customers can seek out these services, and 
a team of freelancers willing to provide these ser-
vices.
It’s no surprise, then, that a host of companies 
have launched on-demand services for the $675 
billion grocery and convenience goods market, 
as well as for the nearly $785 billion restaurant 
market. After past failures of online grocery ser-
vices like Webvan and Kozmo, the time may now 
be right for online grocery and restaurant deliv-
ery to take off. Instacart, one of the leaders in 
on-demand grocery delivery, and GrubHub, a fast 
growing on-demand restaurant delivery service, 
are two of the biggest companies in this emerging 
market. 
Instacart is a service that allows users to 
order groceries on the Web or via the Instacart 
app. Instacart then connects you with dedicated 
shoppers nearby who buy and deliver the grocer-
ies from local stores. Instacart serves 24 cities in 
the United States and is growing quickly into new 
areas, such as Houston and Marin County, Cali-
fornia, in 2016. Instacart’s key demographics are 
Millennials, office workers, and urbanites, as well 
as senior citizens. The prospect of ordering grocer-
ies from their favorite stores without the hassle of 
driving and standing in line is attractive to many 
users, especially those without a car.
For a company like Instacart, the online expe-
rience is critical, whether it be on the Web or via 
app. The Instacart app allows shoppers to deter-
mine exactly where requested items are located 
using aisle navigation. It updates shoppers in real 
time when products aren’t available, and pro-
vides highly customizable options to replace them 
from a catalog of 4 million products. In-app chat 
allows shoppers to communicate with customers. A 
barcode scanning feature allows shoppers to verify 
that they’ve picked the correct item for custom-
ers.  Instacart has invested heavily in analytics, 
and the company claims that its delivery efficiency 
has improved by 20% in 2016, while late deliver-
ies have dropped 25%. Continually optimizing its 
app for the fastest possible shopping experience is 
critical to Instacart’s profitability.
Thanks to these improvements, the company 
recently announced that it is ‘gross margin posi-
tive,’ or that the revenue it generates on each 
order exceeds the cost of fulfilling it. Clearly, the 
company is on the right track to profitability, but 
obstacles remain. Although Instacart has main-
tained industry-leading growth rates over the last 
few years, the company has had to forestall its 
growth plans to focus on profitability, laying off 
many of their in-house recruiters in 2015. Insta-
cart also raised its delivery fees and reduced com-
pensation to shoppers and drivers, which is likely 
to lead to turnover. And though the company is 
steadily becoming more profitable as a whole, 
some markets like New York City have lagged 
behind the rest.
Although Instacart has obtained $275 million 
in venture capital at a $2 billion valuation, inves-
tors may be alarmed by the cost-cutting measures, 
especially within a climate where many startups 
modeled after Uber are struggling mightily. Still, 
grocery stores like Whole Foods and Publix have 
struck deals with Instacart to offer online ordering 
and delivery, while others have made agreements 
to provide grocery orders for pickup, with in-store 

636	
	
C H A P T E R  9     O n l i n e  R e t a i l  a n d  S e r v i c e s 
employees doing the shopping and custom-
ers picking them up on site. Instacart has also 
made deals with brands like General Mills and 
Pepsi to cover the delivery fees when customers 
buy their products using in-app advertisements, 
and the company expects to continue to develop 
new advertising revenue streams going forward. 
The on-demand restaurant delivery market 
already has a host of companies jockeying for 
position, and the most prominent of these in the 
United States is GrubHub. GrubHub is a service 
that allows users to buy food from local restau-
rants and have it delivered. Using the GrubHub 
app, users can type in their address and see a map 
of all of the local restaurants that deliver in the 
area, as well as restaurants that offer food for 
pickup. Filters allow app users to narrow options 
by name, menu item, or style of cuisine, and users 
can order by phone or online. GrubHub also offers 
special deals, reviews, and other perks for diners. 
For restaurants that aren’t big enough to have 
their own mobile app, partnering with GrubHub is 
a great way to increase their exposure and bring 
in more customers from mobile users. GrubHub 
currently works with approximately 44,000 res-
taurants.
GrubHub went public in 2014, and its share 
price has steadily increased throughout 2016, 
though it remains lower than its IPO price in 
July 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, GrubHub 
recorded a 24% increase in active diners from 5.6 
million to 6.97 million, a 21% increase in gross 
sales from $590 million to $713 million, and a 
27% increase in revenues from $88.2 million to 
$112.2 million compared to the same period in 
2015.  Although profits decreased slightly, it still 
recorded $9.9 million in profits for the quarter, 
down just 6% from 2015 levels as the company 
continues to bolster its ability to deliver food via 
acquisitions. GrubHub purchased two meal deliv-
ery services in 2015, Boston-based DiningIn and 
California-based Restaurants on the Run, as well 
as LAbite, also based in California, in 2016, for a 
combined $145 million, and GrubHub is working 
to expand its service even to restaurants that don’t 
normally have the capability to deliver.
However, GrubHub’s future as a dominant 
service in on-demand restaurant delivery is 
far from guaranteed. Bigger rivals with cash to 
burn have entered the fray, such as Yelp, which 
purchased an online ordering and delivery plat-
form in 2015, signaling a desire to compete with 
GrubHub. Other potential competitors include 
Amazon, who is testing its AmazonFresh delivery 
service in major markets, Uber, whose UberEats 
service launched in 2015, Square, which purchased 
food delivery startup Caviar in 2014, and Google, 
which launched its Google Express service in San 
Francisco and Los Angeles in 2016. Other deliv-
ery startups like DoorDash and Postmates have 
arrived on the scene as well. 
Legal concerns loom for both Instacart and 
GrubHub, who have been targeted in lawsuits 
involving their classification of their shoppers 
and delivery drivers as contractors to avoid ben-
efits and payroll taxes. GrubHub was also sued 
for sending text advertisements for restaurants to 
customers without their consent. Though the future 
for Instacart and GrubHub is uncertain, both com-
panies are well positioned to continue growth and 
prove that on-demand grocery and food delivery 
are here to stay.

has grown exponentially. Airbnb now operates in more than 34,000 cities in 190 coun-
tries, and lists over 2 million properties for rent, including 1,400 castles and dozens of 
yurts in Mongolia. In the eight years since its founding, Airbnb has grown to be larger 
than the Intercontinental, the world’s largest private hotel chain, which has about 
5,000 hotels, and about 740,000 rooms around the world. 
Through October 2016, Airbnb has raised $3.2 billion and has a current valuation of 
$30 billion. People with spaces to rent, which can range from a single sofa to an entire 
apartment or house, create an account and a profile, and then list their properties on 
the site. The amount charged depends on the host and is usually based on the host’s 
assessment of similar listings nearby and market demand. Travelers seeking to rent 
spaces register and create an account, which includes a profile. They then consult 
the website listings, read reviews of the host, and contact the host to arrange for the 
rental. After the rental period, hosts rate their renters, and vice versa. Renters pay 
through their Airbnb account, which must be funded by a credit card. Airbnb charges 
guests a sliding fee of 6% to 12%, depending on the price of the booking, and charges 
the host 3%. The hosts are issued a 1099 form at the end of the year to report taxes 
due on the income. 
Uber and Airbnb stand out not only as the most successful of on-demand service 
firms, but also as the most disruptive and controversial. For instance, with Airbnb, 
property renters do not have the regulatory or tax burdens that hotel owners have. It 
is possible that the success of Airbnb could greatly reduce the demand for regulated 
hotels. There is little research on this topic, but an early paper found that Airbnb 
had a small impact on rental income at lower-end tourist hotels, but little empirical 
impact on business traveler hotels (Zervas et al., 2015). The possibility of negative 
outcomes from transactions on these on-demand service sites (e.g., a driver robs or 
harms a passenger, or an apartment is destroyed by renters) is leading both firms to 
require liability insurance, or to offer such insurance for free. Like Uber, Airbnb also 
faces significant legal challenges. In October 2016, a law was enacted in New York 
that imposes fines of up to $7,500 on hosts who list space on the service in violation 
of local housing regulations. Airbnb has filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging 
the law, and also faces similar battles in California, as well as in Holland, Spain, and 
Germany (Benner, 2016).

Your Reservation Is Waiting

penTable is the leading supplier of reservation, table management, and 
guest management software for restaurants. In addition, the company 
operates OpenTable.com, the world’s most popular website for making 
restaurant reservations online. In just over 15 years, OpenTable has 
gone from a startup to a successful and growing public company that counts around 
two-thirds of the nation’s reservation-taking restaurants as clients. 
Today, more than 38,000 restaurants in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the 
United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan use the OpenTable hardware and software 
system. This system automates the reservation-taking and table management process, 
while allowing restaurants to build diner databases for improved guest recognition 
and targeted e-mail marketing. The OpenTable website, mobile site, and mobile app 
provide a fast, efficient way for diners to find available tables in real time. The web-
sites and app connect directly to the thousands of computerized reservation systems 
at OpenTable restaurants, and reservations are immediately recorded in a restaurant’s 
electronic reservation book.

Restaurants subscribe to the OpenTable Electronic Reservation Book (ERB), the 
company’s proprietary software, which is installed on a touch-screen computer system 
and supported by asset-protection and security tools. The ERB software provides a 
real-time map of the restaurant floor and enables the restaurant to retain meal pat-
terns of all parties, serving as a customer relationship management (CRM) system for 
restaurants. The software is upgraded periodically, and the latest version is designed 
to provide increased ease of use and a more thorough view of table availability to help 
turn more tables, enhance guest service, personalize responses to diners, coordinate 
the seating process, and maximize guest seating. The ERBs at OpenTable’s customer 
restaurants connect via the Internet to form an online network of restaurant reserva-
tion books. 
OpenTable’s revenue comes from two sources. Restaurants pay a one-time fee for 
on-site installation and training, a monthly subscription fee for software and hardware, 
and a transaction fee for each restaurant guest seated through online reservations. The 
online reservation service is free to diners. The business model encourages diners to 
assist in viral marketing. When an individual makes a reservation, the site “suggests” 
that they send invites to their dinner companions directly from OpenTable that include 
a link back to the OpenTable site.
OpenTable is a service-based (software as service, or SaaS) e-commerce company. 
In other words, customers don’t buy software and install it on their computers, but 
instead go online and get the software functionality through subscriptions. Open­Table 
is also an online service that does not sell goods, but instead enables diners to make 
reservations, like social networking sites provide services.
The restaurant industry was slow to leverage the power of the Internet. This 
was in part because the industry was, and continues to be, highly fragmented and 
local—made up of more than 30,000 small, independent businesses or local restaurant-
owning groups.
The founders of OpenTable knew that dealing with these restaurants as a single 
market would be difficult. They also realized that the Internet was changing things for 
diners by providing them with instant access to reviews, menus, and other information 
about dining options. And there was no method for making reservations online—we 
all know reserving by phone is time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to errors. In 
order to make the system work, reach and scale were very important. For diners to use 
an online reservation system, they would need real-time access to a number of local 
restaurants, and the ability to instantly book confirmed reservations around the clock. 
If customers were planning a trip to another city, OpenTable would need participating 
restaurants in those cities.
When OpenTable was founded, most restaurants did not have computers, let 
alone systems that would allow online reservations made through a central website. 
OpenTable’s initial strategy was to pay online restaurant reviewers for links to its 
website and target national chains in order to quickly expand its reach. This got the 
company into 50 cities, but it was spending $1 million a month and bringing in only 
$100,000 in revenue. Not exactly a formula for success. OpenTable halted its market-
ing efforts and narrowed its focus to four cities: Chicago, New York, San Francisco, 
and Washington, D.C.

system and deployed a door-to-door sales force to solicit subscriptions from high-end 
restaurants. The combination of e-commerce, user-friendly technology, and the per-
sonal touch worked. The four markets OpenTable targeted initially developed into 
active, local networks of restaurants and diners that continue to grow. OpenTable 
has implemented the same strategy across the country, and now includes approxi-
mately 38,000 OpenTable restaurant customers. In 18 years, the company has seated 
approximately 1 billion diners, including 370 million via its mobile solutions, and it is 
currently averaging 20 million diners per month. In the second quarter of 2016, half 
of its seating requests in North America originated from a mobile device.
As the company grew, investors began making plans for it to go public. In 2009, the 
company proceeded with an initial public offering (IPO) despite a terrible economy 
and worse financial markets. The gamble paid off. On its first day of trading, Open­
Table’s shares climbed 59% and the share price climbed to over $100 in 2013, more 
than five times the $20 IPO price.
In 2014, Priceline announced that it would acquire OpenTable for $2.6 billion. 
OpenTable plans to leverage Priceline’s global reach as it continues to expand its 
business beyond the United States, which has thus far accounted for about 80% of its 
revenues. Clearly, Priceline believes OpenTable can help it grow even further, this 
time into restaurant reservations. They might be right: OpenTable is well-positioned 
for future growth. Its size, track record of growth, and high customer satisfaction rates 
should continue to work in its favor, and the company hopes to branch out from its 
main focus of fine dining into other areas like casual dining. 
OpenTable has benefited from having e-commerce revenue streams from subscrip-
tion fees and per-transaction charges, rather than depending on advertising. Further, 
more than 50% of OpenTable’s revenue comes from B2B subscriptions, which are 
typically part of long-term contracts. Restaurants that have invested in OpenTable’s 
software package are less likely to want to incur the switching costs associated with 
changing to a different reservation management package.
Another reason for its success is that OpenTable has a large number of satis-
fied customers. Restaurant owners report that they and their staff members find the 
software easy to use, and it helps them manage their business better. Specifically, it 
streamlines operations, helps fill additional seats, and improves quality of service, 
providing a concrete return on investment. This has led to both high customer satisfac-
tion and high retention rates. By creating an online network of restaurants and diners 
that transact with each other through real-time reservations, OpenTable has figured 
out how to successfully address the needs of restaurants and diners.
OpenTable’s market also exhibits network effects: the more people use it, the 
more utility the system delivers. More diners discover the benefits of using the online 
reservation system, which in turn delivers value to restaurant customers, and helps 
attract more restaurants to the network. 
While OpenTable is the biggest, most successful online player in the restaurant 
reservations market, it does have competitors. MenuPages offers access to restau-
rant menus and reviews, but visitors to the site can’t make reservations, and the site 
covers only eight U.S. cities. In 2012, OpenTable partnered with onetime competitor 

	
C a s e  S t u d y 	


Urbanspoon, acquiring its reservation management system, Rezbook, and becoming 
Urbanspoon’s reservation provider. Competitors in other countries where OpenTable 
does not yet operate, such as Restalo in Spain and Italy, and in markets like casual 
dining, such as NoWait, represent challenges to OpenTable. India-based startup Zomato 
acquired U.S.-based NexTable in 2015, adding another challenger to the mix, and 
Reserve and Yelp’s SeatMe service also represent potentially formidable competitors 
for OpenTable. Reserve has undercut OpenTable on price, with a $99 monthly sub-
scription fee for restaurant owners compared to $249 for OpenTable, and has strong 
venture capital backing, but has less than two percent of the clients that OpenTable 
has amassed. Yelp may be a more significant immediate threat. OpenTable ended its 
partnership with Yelp in late 2015; Yelp users had been allowed to book reservations 
through OpenTable, but OpenTable hopes to improve its reviewing capability and Yelp’s 
launch of SeatMe shows a desire to enter the reservation business.
The company is committed to bolstering its presence on multiple platforms. It has 
a mobile website, mobile applications that work on all major smartphone platforms, 
and an iPad app that fully integrates with its ERB software. GPS enables mobile users 
to locate and make reservations at nearby venues. In 2015, OpenTable launched a 
version of its app for Apple Watch that reminds diners of their reservations, provides 
directions, and shows a countdown. It is also testing a premium service that involves 
paying for an additional fee for last-minute, prime-time reservations at popular res-
taurants, using a surge pricing algorithm similar to that used by Uber.
OpenTable is attempting to shift its relationship with both diners and restaurants 
from a “transactional” relationship to an “experiential” relationship, which focuses on 
the experience of dining. OpenTable launched its first payments feature that allows 
users to pay for meals completely within the OpenTable app on the iPhone and 
Android in 2015. In 2016, the company released an improved payment option called 
Tab, which automatically bills diners without even having to open the app. Though 
the feature is available in less than 100 restaurants nationwide, the company hopes 
that Tab’s ease of use will make it a popular option for diners in the future. Open­
Table is trying to simplify other areas of the dining experience, including picking a 
venue. In 2016, the company rolled out a feature in its iOS app that allows groups 
of diners to vote on restaurants in a group text format and then quickly confirm the 
selected reservation within iMessage. OpenTable also created a Discover option that 
allows users to pick from restaurants using different criteria: popularity, location, new 
arrivals, and more. Other improvements to its app included better integration with 
Apple Maps and Apple Pay. Currently, the app doesn’t have a robust personalization 
engine to generate its recommendations, but OpenTable leadership plans to remedy 
that in the future.
OpenTable’s growth is projected to continue in the United States, Canada, and 
Mexico despite considerable market penetration. Selective international expansion is 
planned beyond its current operations in Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. 
OpenTable supports each of these locations with a direct sales force servicing approxi-
mately 1,000 restaurants.
The company’s international strategy is to replicate the successful U.S. model 
by focusing initially on building a restaurant customer base. OpenTable believes the

	9.10	 REVIEW
K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Understand the environment in which the online retail sector operates today.
•	
Personal consumption of retail goods and services comprise about 69% and account for about $12.7 tril-
lion of total GDP. 
•	
The retail industry can be divided into seven major firm types: general merchandise, durable goods, spe-
cialty stores, food and beverage, gasoline and fuel, MOTO, and online retail firms. Each type offers oppor-
tunities for online retail. The MOTO sector is the most similar to the online retail sales sector.
•	
During the early days of e-commerce, some predicted that the retail industry would be revolutionized, 
based on reduced search costs, lower marketing entry costs, the replacement of physical store merchants 
by online companies, elimination of middlemen (disintermediation), and hypermediation.
•	
Today, it has become clear that few of the initial assumptions about the future of online retail were cor-
rect. Also, the structure of the retail marketplace in the United States has not been revolutionized. The 
reality is that:
•	
Online consumers are not primarily cost-driven—instead, they are as brand-driven and influenced 
by perceived value as their offline counterparts.
•	
Online market entry costs were underestimated, as was the cost of acquiring new customers.
•	
Older traditional firms, such as the general merchandising giants and the established catalog-based 
retailers, are taking over as the top online retail sites.
•	
Disintermediation did not occur. On the contrary, online retailing has become an example of the 
powerful role that intermediaries play in retail trade.
Explain how to analyze the economic viability of an online firm.
•	
The economic viability, or ability of a firm to survive during a specified time period, can be analyzed by 
examining the key industry strategic factors, the strategic factors that pertain specifically to the firm, and 
the financial statements for the firm. 
•	
The key industry strategic factors include barriers to entry, the power of suppliers, the power of custom-
ers, the existence of substitute products, the industry value chain, and the nature of intra-industry com-
petition.

	
R e v i e w

•	
The key firm strategic factors include the firm value chain, core competencies, synergies, the firm’s cur-
rent technology, and the social and legal challenges facing the firm.
•	
The key financial factors include revenues, cost of sales, gross margin, operating expenses, operating 
margin, net margin, and the firm’s balance sheet.
Identify the challenges faced by the different types of online retailers.
•	
Virtual merchants are single-channel e-commerce firms that generate all of their revenues from online 
sales. Their challenges include building a business and a brand name quickly, many competitors in the 
virtual marketplace, substantial costs to build and maintain an e-commerce presence, considerable mar-
keting expenses, large customer acquisition costs, a steep learning curve, and the need to quickly achieve 
operating efficiencies in order to preserve a profit. Amazon is the most well-known example of a virtual 
merchant.
•	
Omni-channel merchants (bricks-and-clicks) have a network of physical stores as their primary retail chan-
nel, but also have online operations. Their challenges include high cost of physical buildings, high cost of 
large sales staffs, the need to coordinate prices across channels, the need to develop methods of handling 
cross-channel returns from multiple locations, building a credible e-commerce presence, hiring new 
skilled staff, and building rapid-response order entry and fulfillment systems. Macy’s is an example of a 
bricks-and-clicks company.
•	
Catalog merchants are established companies that have a national offline catalog operation as their largest 
retail channel, but who also have online capabilities. Their challenges include high costs for printing and 
mailing, the need to leverage their existing assets and competencies to the new technology environment, 
the need to develop methods of handling cross-channel returns, building a e-commerce presence, and 
hiring new skilled staff. Lands’ End is an example of a catalog merchant.
•	
Manufacturer-direct merchants are either single- or multi-channel manufacturers who sell to consumers 
directly online without the intervention of retailers. Their challenges include channel conflict, quickly 
developing a rapid-response online order and fulfillment system; switching from a supply-push (products 
are made prior to orders being received based on estimated demand) to a demand-pull model (products 
are not built until an order is received); and creating sales, service, and support operations online. Dell is 
an example of a manufacturer-direct merchant.
Describe the major features of the online service sector.
•	
The service sector is the largest and most rapidly expanding part of the economy of advanced industrial 
nations. 
•	
The major service industry groups are financial services, insurance, real estate, business services, and 
health services. 
•	
Within these service industry groups, companies can be further categorized into those that involve trans-
action brokering and those that involve providing a “hands-on” service. 
•	
With some exceptions, the service sector is by and large a knowledge- and information-intense industry. 
For this reason, many services are uniquely suited to e-commerce and the strengths of the Internet.
•	
E-commerce offers extraordinary opportunities to improve transaction efficiencies and thus productivity 
in a sector where productivity has so far not been markedly affected by the explosion in information 
technology.
Discuss the trends taking place in the online financial services industry.
•	
The online financial services sector is a good example of an e-commerce success story, but the success is 
somewhat different than what had been predicted in the early days of e-commerce. Today, the multi-
channel established financial firms are growing the most rapidly and have the best prospects for long-
term viability. 

644	
	
C H A P T E R  9     O n l i n e  R e t a i l  a n d  S e r v i c e s 
•	
Multi-channel firms that have both physical branches and solid online offerings have assumed market 
leadership over pure-online firms.
•	
Financial portals provide comparison shopping services and steer consumers to online providers for inde-
pendent financial advice and financial planning.
•	
Account aggregation is another rapidly growing online financial service, which pulls together all of a 
customer’s financial data on a single personalized website.
•	
Despite a rocky start, the online mortgage market is slowly growing; it is dominated by established online 
banks and other online financial services firms, traditional mortgage vendors, and a few successful online 
mortgage firms.
•	
Term life insurance stands out as one product group supporting the early visions of lower search costs, 
increased price transparency, and the resulting consumer savings. However, in other insurance product 
lines, the Web offers insurance companies new opportunities for product and service differentiation and 
price discrimination.
•	
The early vision that the historically local, complex, and agent-driven real estate industry would be trans-
formed into a disintermediated marketplace where buyers and sellers could transact directly has not been 
realized. 
•	
The major impact of the online real estate industry is in influencing offline purchases and the primary 
service is a listing of available houses, with secondary links to mortgage lenders, credit reporting agen-
cies, neighborhood information, loan calculators, appraisal reports, sales price histories by neighborhood, 
school district data, and crime reports.
Describe the major trends in the online travel services industry today.
•	
The Internet has become the most common channel used by consumers to research travel options and 
book reservations for airline tickets, rental cars, hotel rooms, and tours. 
•	
The major trends in online travel services include consolidation, the rise of meta-search engines, mobile 
devices, and social media.
Identify current trends in the online career services industry.
•	
Next to travel services, job-hunting services have been one of the Internet’s most successful online ser-
vices because they save money for both job hunters and employers. 
•	
Online recruiting can also serve to establish market prices and terms, thereby identifying both the salary 
levels for specific jobs and the skill sets required to achieve those salary levels. 
•	
The major trends in the online career services industry are social networking, mobile, job search engines, 
consolidation, diversification, and localization.
Understand the business models of on-demand service companies.
•	
On-demand service companies provide a platform that enables the on-demand delivery of various ser-
vices, by connecting providers (“sellers”) who wish to exploit their “spare” resources, such as cars, rooms 
with beds, and ability to perform various services via their personal labor, with consumers (“buyers”) who 
would like to utilize those resources and services. The companies collect a fee both from sellers and buy-
ers for using the platform. 
•	
Uber, a car rental service, and Airbnb, a room rental service, are the most well-known on-demand ser-
vices companies. They are also among the most disruptive and controversial.

able and satellite television providers 
like to boast that they offer hundreds, 
if not thousands, of channels. But who 
really watches that many channels? Do you really 
even need cable or satellite TV? An estimated 5% of 
U.S. households (called cord cutters) have already 
dropped paid TV subscriptions. Cord cutters, cord 
nevers (the 15% of U.S. households that have never 
had paid TV), and cord shavers (people who reduce 
their pay TV subscriptions to a minimum) are shrink-
ing the number of pay TV households at about 1% 
annually. Pay TV is not exactly a collapsing market, 
but it is not one that is expanding either. Instead of signing up for cable or satellite TV 
(which typically costs over $100 a month), cord cutters are choosing online providers 
such as Hulu (which can be had for only about $7.99 a month, and which allows viewers 
to stream current and past TV series on a schedule of their choice) and Netflix. More 
worrisome to the cable industry is that people who subscribe to these so-called over-the-
top (OTT) video services are twice as likely to kick out cable TV. Likewise with Millennial 
households: 24% of those under 35 and who use Hulu or Netflix don’t pay for cable TV. 
Analysts estimate that by 2020 fewer than half of Millennials will sign up for pay TV.
Yet some sort of paid cable, satellite, or telecommunications (Verizon FiOS or AT&T 
U-verse) TV service can still be found in 100 million out of the 115 million TV households. 
The average cable TV bill across the country has risen about 8% annually for the last 
decade. But this world of pay TV service now faces challenges as tech-based Internet 
giants move into original television programming and use their Internet skills and brands 
to create, promote, and distribute television content.
A new Internet-based broadcasting system has begun to challenge the existing cable 
TV distribution and production system. More and more original content designed for 
Internet distribution is coming from non-traditional sources such as Netflix, Hulu, and 
Amazon, not to mention YouTube. For instance, Amazon has created Amazon Studios, 
which produces a number of original series, with 11 to 26 episodes each year. Amazon 
Prime customers can stream these series without any additional cost. Amazon also struck 
a deal with HBO to give Amazon Prime members free access to older HBO series such 
as The Sopranos, The Wire, and Band of Brothers. This was the first time HBO licensed 
its content to online viewers outside of its traditional pay TV business. The HBO content

is also available on Amazon’s set-top box, Fire TV. Netflix, the most successful video-
on-demand streaming service to date, began producing original series in 2010. Netflix’s 
first original series was House of Cards which has won numerous Emmy awards. Netflix 
introduces new series each year, including such hits as Orange Is the New Black, BoJack 
Horseman, and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and has become its own TV network. Hulu 
produced Battleground, its first scripted original show in 2012, and since then, has gone 
on to produce a number of additional original series. 
Producers of content in Hollywood and New York also benefit from the new Internet 
broadcasting system because they no longer need to depend on cable providers to distribute 
their content. The Internet has become a substitute distribution system for high quality 
content. Consumers increasingly want to take control of the programming and scheduling 
of the TV shows they watch. On the Internet, consumers can binge watch an entire year’s 
worth of a series, something cable TV doesn’t provide. And consumers don’t want to be 
forced to buy a bundle of channels or pay for content they never watch. The new Internet 
broadcasting system offers freedom of choice, a la carte TV, and consumer control. 
Also troubling for the cable industry is that it is no longer the sure bet it once was for 
investors. In the past, cable systems were a cash cow utility business: add new customers 
by the millions, charge what you want, and pay good dividends. Today, cable systems are 
adding just enough new subscribers to replace the cord cutters. Soon they may not be 
able to do even that. Investors see the end of growth, disaggregation of the cable bundle, 
and potentially an increase in the cord-cutting rate. As a result, the stock prices of cable 
systems and telecommunication providers of video content have been falling for the last 
five years. 
Content producers also face many new opportunities and risks in the Internet broad-
casting system. In the past, broadcast networks were the major primetime content 
producers. They have since been joined by the top cable content providers, such as USA, 
TNT, History Channel, TBS, and FX, all of which create their own original content. These 
content producers earn money by charging cable and satellite providers for the right to 
distribute their content. However, the cable provider system is highly concentrated, and a 
few firms (Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Charter, and Altice (Optimum Online)) control 
access to over 90% of American homes. In the past, content producers were in a weak 
bargaining position. In the new Internet distribution system, content producers now have 
a number of alternatives, such as licensing their content to Hulu, Netflix, Apple, or other 
pay-for-content Internet channels, or even streaming it themselves. For instance, CBS 
launched its own streaming, a la carte television service in 2015, providing access to over 
6,000 on-demand episodes of its current and past shows. HBO quickly followed suit with 
its own streaming service, HBO Now, as did Showtime, a premium cable channel, with 
unlimited access to hundreds of series, documentaries, and movies. 
Yet cord cutting has not yet become national movement. Well over 95% of paid TV 
subscribers still cling to cable because they can afford the service, it provides local news, 
comes with a discounted triple play, and provides coverage of national sporting events. The 
future of paid TV at this point is still quite secure. It may be that the new Internet OTT 
services are simply expanding the market for a different kind of TV and movie program-
ming where users can binge on a series and watch without advertising.

he opening case illustrates how online content distributors like Hulu, 
Netflix, Amazon, Google (YouTube), and others are moving into premium 
content production and sales, and also becoming alternative providers of 
traditional television and movie content, rivaling existing cable and satellite distribu-
tors. If consumers can find their favorite television shows and movies online, then why 
should they pay for cable or satellite TV, especially when a variety of devices enable 
users to display their computer and phone screens on a home TV set? As Internet users 
increasingly change their reading and viewing habits, spurred on by the growth of 
mobile devices, they are challenging existing business models that worked for decades 
to support newspapers, books, magazines, television, and Hollywood movies. Clearly, 
the future of content—news, music, and video—is online. Today, the print industry, 
including newspapers, books, and magazines, is having a difficult time coping with 
the movement of their readership to digital alternatives. Broadcast and cable televi-
sion, along with Hollywood and the music industry, are also wrestling with outdated 
business models based on physical media. Established media giants are continuing to 
make extraordinary investments in unique online content, new technology, new digital 
distribution channels, and entirely new business models. Internet giants like Apple, 
Google, Amazon, and Facebook are competing to dominate online content distribution. 
	10.1	 ONLINE CONTENT
No other sector of the American economy has been so challenged by the Internet and 
the Web than the content industries. The online content industries are organized into 
two major categories: the print industries (newspapers, magazines, and books), and 
the entertainment industries, which includes television, movies, music (including 
radio), and games. Together, the online content industries are expected to generate 
revenues of at least $23 billion in 2016.
In this chapter, we will look closely at publishing (newspapers, magazines, and 
books) and entertainment (television and movies, music and radio, and games) as 
they attempt to transform their traditional media into digitally deliverable forms and 
experiences for consumers, while at the same time earning profits. These industries 
make up the largest share of the commercial content marketplace, both offline and 
online. In each of these industries, there are powerful offline brands, significant new 
pure-play online providers and distributors, consumer constraints and opportunities, 
a variety of legal issues, and new mobile technology platforms that offer an entirely 
new content distribution system in the form of smartphones and tablet computers.
Table 10.1 describes the most recent trends in online content and media for 
2016–2017.
CONTENT AUDIENCE AND MARKET: WHERE ARE THE EYEBALLS AND THE 
MONEY?
In 2016, the average American adult spends around 4,300 hours each year consum-
ing various media, twice the amount of time spent at work (2,000 hours/year) (see

Figure 10.1). U.S. entertainment and media revenues (both online and offline) in 2015 
were estimated to be $262 billion, and they are expected to grow at a compound rate 
of 6% annually to 2020. Sales of tablets and smartphones have created new revenue 
streams for entertainment and media firms as consumer behavior changes in response 
to the new technologies. Content is no longer tied to physical products and can be 
delivered over the Internet from cloud servers to multiple mobile devices, reducing 
costs for consumers. Currently, online digital entertainment and media revenue is 9% 
of total entertainment and media revenue, or an estimated $23 billion. Millennials, the 
generation of people born between 1980 and 2000 (sometimes referred to as Digital 
Natives), are often thought to consume media very differently from their parents and 
Baby Boomers. For a discussion of how Millennials differ in media consumption, see 
Insight on Society: Are Millennials Really All That Different?
Media Utilization: A Converging Digital Stream
The proliferation of mobile devices—tablets and smartphones—has led to an increase 
in the total amount of time spent listening to radio, watching TV and movies, and 
reading books, newspapers, and even magazines. Internet mobile and desktop account 
for over 60% of total media time spent. While the number of hours of TV viewing used 
to be far larger than Internet usage, since the development of mobile devices, time 
spent on desktops plus the mobile Internet is now expected to consume 5.7 hours 
compared to 4.15 hours spent watching television on a TV in 2016. On the other hand, 
a great deal of Internet usage is watching time-shifted television shows! In 2016, over

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
ARE MILLENNIALS REALLY ALL THAT 
DIFFERENT?
If you were born between 1981 and 
2000, congratulations! You are a Mil-
lennial and the subject of Millennial 
mania, which is now gripping the advertis-
ing, retailing, educational, and journalistic worlds. 
Not since the Baby Boomers has so much cover-
age been given to a single generation. 
Some people believe that Millennials are 
so different from previous generations that they 
require new kinds of products, new types of mar-
keting and advertising techniques to persuade 
them to buy, and entirely new educational tech-
niques. Millennials drink more specialty coffee, so 
coffee makers are responding with multiple new 
specialty coffee drinks. How about an orange-
pineapple latte? And there’s a hint of lower prices 
geared to the fact that Millennials are earning 
less, have higher rates of unemployment, and 
extraordinary student debt. There’s a lot of money 
at stake getting the pulse of Millennials and figur-
ing out how to market to them. Millennials now 
make up the largest generation in the United 
States, constituting about 80 million consumers, 
and over 30% of the labor force. 
Millennials are just the latest in a long line 
of generalizations about people who grew up in 
specific time periods. The Greatest Generation 
(1901–1924) came of age during the Great 
Depression and served in World War II. The Baby 
Boomers (1946–1964) grew up with the civil 
rights movement, political unrest, and rock and 
roll. Generation X (1965–1980) continued the 
trends of the Baby Boomers except more so. Gen-
eration Xers were the first to experience a slow-
down in living standards, and a growing sense that 
they might not earn as much as their parents. The 
Millennials are continuing many of the trends of 
previous generations, including an alienation from 
cultural and political institutions, a decline in reli-
gious belief and marriage rates, higher levels of 
student loan debt, poverty, and unemployment, and 
the reality—not just the fear—that they will earn 
less than their parents at a similar age. The Mil-
lennials are much more ethnically diverse as well: 
nearly half of the Millennial generation were not 
born in the United States. 
But perhaps most important according to 
some is that Millennials are digital natives: they 
are the first generation to be born into the digital 
revolution of the 20th century. They grew up with 
the commercial Internet. According to Marc 
Prensky, an author and promoter of educational 
games, Millennials’ brains are physically different 
because of long-term exposure to interactive video 
games, console controllers (the “twitch” effect), 
graphical interfaces, and non-linear hypertext 
experiences on the Internet. Today’s digital natives, 
in his view, cannot learn from books, newspapers, 
or linear stories even if they are video-based. 
They are bored by these old-school learning tools. 
The implications for education are, according to 
Prensky, to throw out traditional, old-style, linear 
thinking found in books and school curricula, and 
replace these with video games and link-clicking 
for nearly all subjects. This is referred to as the 
“gamification” of education. 
But real-world Millennials don’t seem to fit 
the Prensky mold. In fact, there is no evidence 
that Millennials think differently from other gen-
erations, have physically different brains, or can 
learn only by using games. More Millennials have 
a college degree and more graduate school atten-

(continued)
dance than other generations. They apparently do 
learn in traditional environments, and they didn’t 
get through all this education by playing games! 
Academic researchers have dismissed much of 
the digital native thesis, finding little support for 
claims that Millennials have adopted learning 
styles that are radically different from those of 
their parents. 
But clearly Millennials have had a very dif-
ferent experience growing up with technology than 
their parents, given the incredible advancement 
of digital technologies in the last three decades 
that have created entirely new platforms like 
smartphones, tablets, digital photography, highly 
interactive console and PC games, all of which 
have changed how content—books, newspapers, 
magazines, TV, and Hollywood movies—is created, 
distributed, and consumed. Millennials probably 
think like everyone else, but they do have differ-
ent patterns of content consumption. Let’s look 
at the data. 
Given their intense use of the Internet, and 
absorption in digital experiences, including games, 
one would think Millennials would read few books 
(too boring and not twitchy or interactive enough), 
and that they would believe the Internet contained 
just about all the content and knowledge worth 
knowing about. Not so, according to a large study 
by Pew Research: Millennials are more likely to 
have read a book in the past 12 months than older 
adults, 88% vs. 79%. Almost 40% report having 
read an e-book in the past year, about the same as 
older adults. They are more likely to use a smart-
phone to read e-books than a Kindle. And they 
are more likely to think that there’s a lot of useful 
information that is not on the Internet, more so 
than older adults. They are just as likely to have 
used a library in the past twelve months, and 
more likely to have used a library website. Even 
more unexpected: a study of 2,000 American and 
U.K. Millennials found this group overwhelmingly 
preferred printed books to e-books, and 
preferred buying them at bookstores rather 
than online stores like Amazon. Apparently, 600 
years of reading printed books has created a print 
habit that might survive the Internet! 
Millennials are only half as likely to subscribe 
to a print newspaper, but they are more likely to 
read news on digital news sites or get news (or 
links to news stories) from social sites, and to use 
their cell phones to follow news stories. Millen-
nials are not news-less: 69% read news stories 
every day, some in print and even more online. 
Given Millennials’ intense exposure to high 
speed, interactive, “twitch”-oriented video and 
video games, surely they are not about to watch 
passive, linear TV series online or offline, like 
regular cable television, or stream feature-length 
movies that require concentration. Surely they 
would not sit for 30 hours to binge watch a TV 
series already ten years old. Here too, the evi-
dence does not fit the stereotype, although there 
are some differences. Contrary to the stereotype, 
Millennials watch 100–130 hours of regular 
cable TV per month, about the same as older 
adults. Marketers believe Millennial interest in 
TV is greater than any generation. Over 70% 
watch television live, without digital delays or 
streaming, slightly less than older adults. They 
like comedy and sitcoms more than older adults, 
and are more likely to watch TV on a smartphone 
or tablet. They also adore older TV series that 
they may have watched as children. In fact, they 
seem to have transformed the Internet from a 
media that involves reading to one that involves 
viewing. About 55% of binge viewers are Mil-
lennials. 
Millennials are more involved with online 
video: they watch 200 more videos per month 
than older adults, mostly on YouTube, in large 
part because they are more likely to have and use 
smartphones. Millennials are nearly twice as likely 

656	
	
C H A P T E R  1 0     O n l i n e  C o n t e n t  a n d  M e d i a
to use streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, 
and Amazon, and are less likely to have cable 
or satellite TV service than older adults. About 
13% of Millennials have no pay TV service, not 
that different from 9% of older adults. Millen-
nials are not cutting the cord in large numbers, 
although they are more likely to have never had 
cable TV (“cord nevers”). They are using their 
smartphones and tablets as TV substitutes, 
viewing TV shows wherever and whenever they 
want. Almost 20% of Millennials use only a 
mobile device for Internet access, compared to 
5% for older adults. Millennials are driving a 
surge in YouTube action sports videos (surfing, 
skateboarding, and snowboarding). When it comes 
to finding interesting TV shows and videos, Mil-
lennials rely much more than other adults on their 
Facebook friends and newsfeeds. Finally, Millen-
nials play a more active role in creating video 
content than older adults by posting photos and 
videos to social sites. 
Millennials really do consume content differ-
ently than older adults of previous generations, 
although the differences appear to be far less and 
more commonsensical than journalists portray. 
For instance, Millennials take more advantage 
of the latest technologies from smartphones to 
access streaming music and TV services than, say, 
Baby Boomers, although Baby Boomers, the gen-
eration that created the digital revolution, have 
adopted the new technologies nearly as much. Mil-
lennials have not lost interest in society or news 
about society, they just access it online somewhat 
more than older adults. Millennials do indeed 
create and share more content than elders, and 
control their TV schedules more often, including 
binge watching, even though they are watching 
hundreds of hours of cable TV every month. 
Reaching Millennials can be a problem for 
marketers. They are more likely to visit content 
sites such as Vice and Vox than traditional print 
sources, but their most frequent news sites include 
CNN and the New York Times websites. They are 
more likely to use ad blockers and tune out any 
kind of online ad. They are more visual and are 
more likely to use Tumblr, Pinterest, and Ins-
tagram. And they are much more likely to use 
mobile payment methods than Boomers. 
Millennials are different, but not so differ-
ent that we don’t recognize them as our children, 
inheritors of very powerful digital technologies, 
to be sure, but inheritors also of several thousand 
years of literature, history, and culture, which they 
continue to find of enduring value.

165 million people will use their computers and/or mobile devices to watch televi-
sion shows, over 50% of the general population. Therefore, the distinction between 
Internet usage and television usage is not easy to make. The method of transmission 
is just different: cable TV versus the Internet. The Internet, television, and movies 
are converging into a single digital stream. This convergence is described later in 
the chapter. Well over 80% of television viewers multitask while watching television, 
usually using a smartphone or tablet computer, texting with friends, reading e-mail, 
searching the Web, or visiting social networks, activities which have nothing to do with 
what’s happening on the TV screen (eMarketer, 2016b). 
Internet and Traditional Media: Cannibalization versus Complementarity
Several studies reveal that time spent on the Internet reduces consumer time available 
for other media (Pew Research Center, 2013). This is referred to as cannibalization. The 
alternative argument is that the Internet and traditional media are complementary and 
mutually supportive rather than substitutive. True, there has been a massive shift of the 
general audience to the Web, tablets, and smartphones, and once there, a large percent-
age of time is spent on viewing content. Yet, more recent data finds a more complex 
picture. Despite the availability of the Internet on high-resolution tablet computers, 
television viewing remains strong, video viewing on all devices has increased, and the 
reading of all kinds of books, including physical books, has increased. New television sets 
are Internet-enabled, allowing consumers to use the Internet to view TV shows on their 
traditional TVs. Total music consumption measured in hours a day listening to music 
has increased even as sales of CDs have drastically declined; likewise, movie consump-
tion has increased even as DVD sales also decline markedly. The impact of the Internet 
on media appears to be increasing the total demand for media, including stimulating 
demand for products like books. The overall pattern is that physical products like CDs 
and DVDs are being replaced by digital versions delivered on computers, tablets, and 
smartphones either as downloaded content or as streaming services. 
Media Revenues
An examination of entertainment and media industry revenues reveals a somewhat 
different pattern when compared to media consumption (see Figure 10.2). In 2015, 
media of all kinds generated $262 billion in revenue (not including transmission fees 
for content such as cable TV subscription fees). Television and home video accounted 
for about 34% and print media (books, newspapers, and magazines) for 32% of total 
media revenues. Box office (motion pictures and theaters) accounted for 9%, as did 
Internet media (online music and video), and video games. Radio and recorded music 
together accounted for 8%. Internet media, while relatively small now, is growing at 
12% annually, far faster than traditional media revenues.
Three Revenue Models for Digital Content Delivery: Subscription, A La Carte, and 
Advertising-Supported (Free and Freemium)
There are three revenue models for delivering content on the Internet. The two pay 
models are subscriptions (usually “all you can eat”) and a la carte (pay for what you 
use). The third model uses advertising revenue to provide content for free, usually 
	
O n l i n e  C o n t e n t

with a freemium (higher price) option. There is also completely free, user-generated 
content, which we will discuss later. Contrary to early analysts’ projections that “free” 
would drive “paid” out of business, it turns out that both models are viable now and in 
the near future. Consumers increasingly choose to pay for high-quality, convenient, 
and unique content, and they have gladly accepted free advertiser-supported content 
when that content is deemed not worth paying for but entertaining nevertheless. 
There’s nothing contradictory about all three models working in tandem and coop-
eratively: free content can drive customers to paid content, as streaming services like 
Pandora and Spotify have discovered. 
Online Content Consumption
Now let’s look at what kinds of online content Internet users purchase or view online 
in 2016 (Figure 10.3). It’s not a surprise that 81% of Internet users watch online video 
of many kinds, but it may be a surprise that 67% of Internet users read online news-
papers. Playing games on a mobile device and watching online TV shows and movies 
are the next most popular. The percentage of Internet users that read e-books (32%) 
initially grew at triple-digit rates when the Kindle was introduced in 2007 and the iPad 
in 2010, but has since slowed. What this reveals is that Internet users retain their affin-
ity to traditional formats—newspapers, radio, TV shows and movies, books, and music 
tracks and albums—and bring these tastes to the Internet and their mobile devices.
Figure 10.4 on page 660 shows estimated U.S. online entertainment content 
revenues, projected to 2019. Online TV and movies generate the most revenue and 
are expected to continue to do so through 2019. Revenues from online video games 
now generate the second largest amount of paid content revenue and are expected to

continue rising through 2019. Revenue from music sales in the form of downloads has 
declined slightly, but this is, and will continue to be, offset by the growth of revenues 
from streaming music, which is growing at 40%.
Free or Fee: Attitudes About Paying for Content and the Tolerance for 
Advertising
In the early years of online content, multiple surveys found that large majorities of 
the Internet audience expected to pay nothing for online content although equally 
large majorities were willing to accept advertising as a way to pay for free content. In 
reality, on the early Web, there wasn’t much high-quality content. However, since then, 
consumer behavior and attitudes toward paying for content have greatly changed. 
Until services such as iTunes arrived in 2003, few thought the “fee” model could 
compete with the “free” model, and many Internet analysts believed that informa-
tion on the Internet needed to be free. Cable TV systems and cable content providers 
like ESPN had a totally different history: they always charged for service and content, 
and cable executives, investors, and TV experts never thought information should be 
free. Neither did the Hollywood and New York media companies that paid for and 
provided the content to television and movie theaters. The culture of the Internet 
began to change when Apple introduced iTunes as a source of relatively inexpensive, 
high quality music and firms such as YouTube (and its parent Google), which started 
out with a business model based on amateur videos and illegally uploaded music 
videos, began cooperating closely with Hollywood and New York production studios

for premium content. In 2016, millions of Internet users are now more than willing to 
pay for high-quality content delivered on a convenient device such as a smartphone, 
tablet computer, or e-reader or using services like those offered by Netflix, Apple TV, 
or Amazon Video. 
DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT (DRM) AND WALLED GARDENS
Digital rights management (DRM) refers to a combination of technical (both hard-
ware and software) and legal means for protecting digital content from unlimited 
reproduction and distribution without permission. DRM hardware and software 
encrypts content so that it cannot be used without some form of authorization typi-
cally based on a payment. The objective is to control the uses of content after it has 
been sold or rented to consumers. Essentially, DRM can prevent users from purchas-
ing and making copies for widespread distribution over the Internet without compen-
sating the content owners. While music tracks in the iTunes Store were originally 
protected by DRM, in 2009, Apple abandoned the practice because of user objections, 
and because Amazon had opened an online music store in 2007 without any DRM 
protections, with the support of music label firms, who came to realize that DRM 
prevented them from exploiting the opportunities of the Internet and perhaps even 
encouraged an illegal market. Streaming content services are inherently difficult to 
copy and re-distribute. Movies streamed from Netflix are technically difficult for the 
average user to capture and share although new apps like Meerkat and Periscope

(Twitter) make live re-streaming very easy even if the quality is low. Likewise, music 
streamed from Pandora is cumbersome to record and share. Streaming services, includ-
ing both Apple and Amazon, use a kind of DRM called a walled garden to restrict the 
widespread sharing of content. They do this by tying the content to the hardware, 
operating system, or streaming environment. E-books purchased from Amazon can 
only be read on Kindles or Kindle apps and Kindle books cannot be converted to other 
formats. By locking the content to a physical device, or a digital stream with no local 
storage, the appliance makers derive additional revenues and profits by locking cus-
tomers into their service or device and satisfy the demands of content producers to 
be fairly compensated for their work. Google’s YouTube identifies and tracks copy-
righted music and removes it if music labels have not granted permission, and offers 
owners the revenue from advertising if they choose to let the music remain on the 
site. 
MEDIA INDUSTRY STRUCTURE
The media content industry prior to 1990 was composed of many smaller independent 
corporations specializing in content creation and distribution in the separate indus-
tries of film, television, book and magazine publishing, and newspaper publishing. 
During the 1990s and into this century, after an extensive period of consolidation, 
huge entertainment and publishing media conglomerates emerged.
The media industry is still organized largely into three separate vertical stove-
pipes: print, movies, and music. Each segment is dominated by a few key players, 
and generally there is very little crossover from one segment to another. For example, 
newspapers typically do not also produce Hollywood films, and publishing firms do 
not own newspapers or film production studios. The purchase of the Washington Post 
in 2013 by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, and an Internet mogul in his own right, 
was an anomaly. Even within media conglomerates that span several different media 
segments, separate divisions generally control each media segment. 
In the past, we have not included the delivery platform firms, such as Comcast, 
Time Warner Cable, AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and Dish Network, in this analysis because 
in general they did not focus on the creation of content but instead just moved 
content produced by others across cable, satellite, and telephone networks. However, 
within the last several years, this has begun to change. Comcast led the way with 
the acquisition of a majority interest in NBC Universal.  AT&T’s proposed merger 
with Time Warner and Verizon’s proposed purchase of Yahoo, along with its previous 
acquisition of AOL, are signs that the telecommunications companies are moving into 
the content and distribution market, as well as the Internet advertising industry, in 
a major way.
MEDIA CONVERGENCE: TECHNOLOGY, CONTENT, AND INDUSTRY 
STRUCTURE
Media convergence is a much used but poorly defined term. There are at least three 
dimensions of media where the term convergence has been applied: technology, 
content (artistic design, production, and distribution), and the industry’s structure as a 
walled garden
refers to a kind of DRM 
that uses proprietary file 
formats, operating systems, 
and hardware to control 
the use of content after 
initial sale

whole. Ultimately for the consumer, convergence means being able to get any content 
you want, when you want it, on whatever platform you want it—from an iPod to an 
iPad, Android phone, or home PC, or set-top device like Apple TV.
Technological Convergence
Convergence from a technology perspective (technological convergence) has to do 
with the development of hybrid devices that can combine the functionality of two or 
more existing media platforms, such as books, newspapers, television, movies, radio, 
and games, into a single device. Examples of technological convergence include the 
iPad, iPhone, and Android (“smartphones”) that combine telephone, print, music, 
photos, and video in a single device.
Content Convergence
A second dimension of convergence is content convergence. There are three aspects 
to content convergence: design, production, and distribution.
There is a historical pattern in which content created in an older media technol-
ogy migrates to the new technology largely intact, with little artistic change. Slowly, 
the different media are integrated so that consumers can move seamlessly back and 
forth among them, and artists (and producers) learn more about how to deliver content 
in the new media. Later, the content itself is transformed by the new media as artists 
learn how to fully exploit the capabilities in the creation process. At this point, content 
convergence and transformation has occurred—the art is different because of the 
new capabilities inherent to new tools. For instance, European master painters of the 
fifteenth century in Italy, France, and the Netherlands (such as van Eyck, Caravag-
gio, Lotto, and Vermeer) quickly adopted new optical devices such as lenses, mirrors, 
and early projectors called camera obscura that could cast near-photographic quality 
images on canvases, and in the process they developed new theories of perspective 
and new techniques of painting landscapes and portraits. Suddenly, paintings took on 
the qualities of precision, detail, and realism found later in photographs (Boxer, 2001). 
A similar process is occurring today as artists and writers assimilate new digital and 
Internet tools into their toolkits. For instance, GarageBand from Apple enables low-
budget independent bands (literally working in garages) to mix and control eight dif-
ferent digital music tracks to produce professional sounding recordings on a shoestring 
budget. Writers of books are beginning to think about video and interactive versions 
of their books. Online newspapers are changing the news cycle to a 24-hour stream, 
producing their own video channels, and expanding user comment opportunities on 
their websites. 
On the production side, tools for digital editing and processing (for film and televi-
sion) are driving content convergence. Given that the most significant cost of content 
is its creation, if there is a wide diversity of target delivery platforms, then it is wise 
to develop and produce only once using technology that can deliver to multiple plat-
forms. Generally, this means creating content on digital devices (hardware and soft-
ware) so that it can be delivered on multiple digital platforms.

Figure 10.5 depicts the process of media convergence and transformation using 
the example of books. For example, consider this book. In 2016, this book was written 
with a view to appearing on iPads and Kindle e-book readers, and is moving closer 
to the media maturity stage, in which the book will be available mostly as a purely 
digital product with substantial visual and aural content that can be displayed on many 
different digital devices. By that time, the learning experience will be transformed by 
greater use of interactive graphics, videos, as well as an integrated testing system that 
monitors student performance during the semester. Even the number of pages read by 
students, and the time on page, will be accounted for by this near-future digital learn-
ing system. Traditional bound books will probably still be available (books have many 
advantages), but most likely, print editions will be printed on demand by customers 
using their own print facilities.
Industry Structure Convergence
A third dimension of convergence is the structure of the various media industries. 
Industry convergence refers to the merger of media enterprises into powerful, syn-
ergistic combinations that can cross-market content on many different platforms and 
create new works that use multiple platforms. This can take place either through 
purchases or through strategic alliances. Traditionally, each type of media—film, text,

CONVERGENCE AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF CONTENT: 
BOOKS
 
The Internet is making it possible for publishers and writers to transform the standard “book” into a new form 
that integrates features of both text and the Internet, and also transforms the content of the book itself.

music, television—had its own separate industry, typically composed of very large 
players. For instance, the entertainment film industry has been dominated by a few 
large Hollywood-based production studios, book publication is dominated by a few 
large book publishers, and music production is dominated by four global record label 
firms.
However, the Internet has created forces that make mergers and partnerships 
among media and Internet firms a necessary business proposition. Media industry con-
vergence may be necessary to finance the substantial changes in both the technology 
platform and the content. Traditional media firms who create the content generally 
do not possess the core competencies or financial heft to distribute it on the Internet. 
Technology companies that dominate the Internet (Google, Apple, Amazon, and Face-
book) have the competency and wealth to pursue Internet channel strategies, but do 
not currently have the competencies needed to create content. Business combinations 
and partnerships are made to solve these issues.
While traditional media companies have not done well in purchases of Inter-
net platform companies, the technology owners such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, 
Microsoft, and Google have generally avoided merging with media companies, and 
instead rely on contractual arrangements with media companies to protect intellectual 
property rights and to create a business pricing model that both parties can accept. 
However, this pattern is changing. For instance, CBS Inc., a movie and television 
content producer, produces television shows for Netflix; Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon 
produce and distribute their own original series; Google is producing original content 
designed for Internet distribution on YouTube. Amazon created its own book imprint, 
Amazon Books Publishing, and entered the book publishing business. And in 2016, as 
noted previously, telecommunications companies are joining the fray, with Verizon 
proposing to acquire Yahoo and AT&T proposing to merge with Time Warner. In this 
sense, the Internet is changing the media industry from what it was in the recent past.
In the end, consumers’ demands for content anywhere, anytime, and on any 
device are pushing the technology and content companies toward both strategic alli-
ances and strategic conflicts in their search for advantage. 
	10.2	 THE ONLINE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY
Nothing is quite so fundamental to a civilized society as reading text. Text is the 
way we record our history, current events, thoughts, and aspirations, and transmit 
them to all others in the civilization who can read. Even television shows and movies 
require scripts. Today, the publishing industry (composed of books, newspapers, maga-
zines, and periodicals) is a $93 billion media sector based originally on print, and 
now moving rapidly to the Internet and mobile delivery. The Internet offers the text 
publishing industry an opportunity to move toward a new generation of newspapers, 
magazines, and books that are produced, processed, stored, distributed, and sold over 
the Web, available anytime, anywhere, and on any device. The same Internet offers 
the possibility of destroying many existing print-based businesses that may not be able 
to make this transition and remain profitable.

ONLINE NEWSPAPERS
Newspapers in 2016 are the most troubled segment of the print publishing industry. 
Newspaper industry revenues have shrunk from their high of $60 billion in 2000 to 
about $30 billion in 2015 (see Figure 10.6). The newspaper labor force has roughly 
been cut in half over this period. The newspaper industry has been in an extended 
period of digital disruption since the rise of the Web in 2000 and the emergence of 
powerful search engines like Google, which allow consumers to search for news on 
any subject without having to browse a physical newspaper or an online edition. Social 
media sites have become a major source of unique visitors, who, unfortunately, do 
not browse for news and usually stay on the newspaper’s site for only a few moments 
to read a single article. These fleeting visitors typically do not engage with the news-
paper as a whole or with its online ads. Even before the Internet and Web, newspa-
per revenue was falling due to the influence of earlier technologies like broadcast 
and cable television. In 2014, three of the largest newspaper organizations (Gannett, 
Tribune Company, and E.W. Scripps) spun off their newspaper operations as indepen-
dent firms so they could focus on television and other media assets, including in some 
cases, successful digital properties. Newspapers will now be pure-play print and online 
enterprises and will have to make it on their own without the protection of television 
or other media assets (Carr, 2014). 
Newspaper ad revenues have declined by 50% since 1980. As a percentage of total revenues, circulation subscription revenues have become 
more important. Digital is a small source of revenue but growing up until recently.

The striking growth of alternative pure digital news sources in the last five years, 
from Twitter and Facebook, to Vox, Vice, BuzzFeed, Reddit, and Huffington Post, poses 
additional challenges. Online news sources are attracting millions of consumers every-
day and steer potential newspaper readers—both online and offline—away from the 
most valuable front page of print and digital edition newspapers. The shift of consumers 
toward the mobile platform and social media deepens the potential for disruption in the 
newspaper industry. Social media sites are playing a significant factor in directing traffic 
directly to specific newspaper articles, bypassing the newspaper’s valuable front page, 
and increasingly, are providing their own original reporting and commentary by hiring 
professional journalists away from troubled newspapers. In 2015, the New York Times, 
along with nine other news media outlets, agreed as an experiment to embed a few of 
its articles directly into Facebook’s News Feed as a way to attract millions of new readers, 
and hopefully convert them from free readers to paid digital subscribers. Facebook calls 
these news stories Instant Articles. What started as an experiment has become a major 
source of readers for newspaper articles, but not the entire newspaper. Newspapers are 
now hiring social media editors to follow trending topics and post articles to newsfeeds. 
Other news publishers are considering a similar move. The downside is that readers 
might not ever return to the newspaper websites, which are the most lucrative for digital 
newspapers. Newspaper survival will depend on how fast newspaper organizations can 
transform themselves from print to digital, and how fast they can monetize the expand-
ing audience for news all the time, anywhere, on all devices. 
As can be seen from Figure 10.6, while newspaper circulation revenues (subscrip-
tions plus newsstand sales) have declined 10% since 2000 to around $11 billion, print 
advertising, which includes display ads, classified ads, and legal notices, has fallen 
precipitously from a high of $48 billion in 2000 to $15 billion in 2015. Online adver-
tising in newspapers in the last year has shown weak growth, accounting for about 
$3.7 billion in revenue, and newspapers’ revenues from online ads are still only 25% 
of print ad revenue, and only 12.5% of total revenue. The gains in online digital ad 
revenue are not large enough to compensate for the loss of print revenue. Only the 
music industry has suffered a similarly devastating decline in revenue. The 15-year 
decline in newspaper revenues has resulted from four factors: 
•	 The growth of the Web and mobile devices as an alternative medium for news and 
advertising. The movement of consumers to an online life style has drained billions 
of ad dollars (including classified ads) from the printed newspaper. The same has 
not been true of television advertising as we will discuss later in the chapter. Even 
radio advertising has stood up well to the digital revolution. 
•	 The rise of alternative digital sources for news, commentary, feature stories, and 
articles. 
•	 The difficulty of traditional newspaper firms and their managers to develop suitable 
business and revenue models that could survive and even prosper on the Internet, 
and the mobile/social platform.
•	 The rise of social media, and its role in directing traffic to newspaper content, has 
challenged newspapers to change their business model to accommodate changes 
in consumer behavior and technology.

From Print-centric to Digital First: The Evolution of Newspaper Online Business 
Models, 1995–2016
Since 1995, when e-commerce and digital advertising began, through to the present, 
newspapers have developed three distinct business models in an effort to adapt to the 
Internet, and more recently, the mobile and social platform (see Figure 10.7). The 
three models are: Print-centric (1995–2000), Integrated Print/Web (2000–2010), and 
the most current model, Digital First (2010–present). You can compare these models 
on four dimensions: 
•	 Search and discovery: How do readers find the news? 
•	 Awareness: How are potential readers made aware of news? 
•	 Engagement: How are readers engaged with the news and journalists? 
•	 Technology platform: How, when, and where is the news delivered to readers? 
(New York Times, 2014). 
The milestones reflect important dates in the evolution of the Web and the mobile-
social platform. In 1998 to 2000, Google launched its search engine with 60 million 
pages indexed, and introduced search engine paid advertising based on its Page Rank 
algorithm. In 2007, Apple introduced its iPhone, creating a truly mobile and universal 
web device, and Facebook opened its site to the public, and in 2008 signed up over 100 
million users, creating the first large-scale, online social network. 
 
Newspapers have gone through three different business models as they adapt to the Internet.

Prior to the development of the Web, search engines, mobile devices, and social 
media platforms, readers discovered the news by browsing (a form of searching) the 
printed paper. They became aware of stories by reading the front page, section pages, 
and article titles. Readers did not engage with journalists, editors, or other contribu-
tors, except for the few who wrote letters to the editor (less than 1% of all readers). 
Journalism was considered a profession, and readers were not expected to do much 
more than read and be fascinated, enlightened, and entertained by people who obvi-
ously were more informed than they. Journalists worked all day on their articles and 
filed them at 5 PM; professional editors revised the copy, and compositors put it on 
the page for the presses, which ran after midnight. The news stream ended at 5 PM. 
The technology platform was print, sometimes with color (a major innovation and 
expense in this period). 
With the introduction of the Web and its growing popularity, newspapers 
retained their existing print-centric strategy and culture. In the Print-centric period 
from 1995 to 2000, newspapers created digital copies of their print editions and 
posted them online. Readers discovered stories as they did before, by reading the 
front page online, following links to stories, and clicking on topic areas or sections 
(e.g., Sports or Technology). Stories were promoted by a business department that 
sought to enlarge the print audience and to attract advertisers based on readership 
and online visitors. Digital advertising was very limited, in part because advertisers 
did not believe it was effective. Readers were not engaged with journalists except 
insofar as they read the stories and could identify with the subjects of stories. The 
business process of creating journalism did not change: articles were filed at 5 PM 
and went to print editors, and then were sent to the web team and the print group. 
There was little difference, if any, between the print and online versions. The tech-
nology platform for the digital edition was the desktop or laptop, and news was 
consumed at home and work. 
In the Integrated Print/Web period, from 2000 to 2010, newspapers adopted mul-
timedia elements such as video, added more interactive elements like crossword 
puzzles and contests, and provided more reader feedback opportunities, especially on 
opinion and editorial pages. There were opportunities to personalize the news using 
RSS feeds and push news to the reader. Nevertheless, news was discovered by the 
reader visiting the website; promoting content online was limited, primarily to RSS 
feeds. Readers were somewhat more engaged. The technology platform remained the 
desktop or laptop platform. 
In the Digital First period, from 2010 to the present, three developments in the 
technology and popular audience platform occurred: the rapid adoption of smart-
phones and tablets, and the equally astounding growth of social media sites like Face-
book and Twitter, which have come to dominate consumer time on the Web and mobile 
devices. In addition, the rise of startup news sites specifically focused on using the 
new technology and platforms has spurred newspapers to radically transform their 
business—or go out of business. The new platform is not based on personal computers 
using a browser, but on mobile devices and apps, with desktops and laptops now just 
one pillar of the delivery platform. In this new environment, the news does not stop 
at 5 PM, but goes on 24×7. Stories might start with a tweet, or from a Facebook post, 
668

followed by thousands of tweets, then millions of shares on multiple social sites and 
finally an article in the online newspaper, and perhaps in the print edition as well. 
Often amateurs on scene know more about the news in the first hours of a story than 
any collection of journalists in their offices. Amateurs provide video feeds, commen-
tary, and opinion. 
The Digital First business model inverts previous models: the top priority is pro-
ducing the most engaging, continually updated digital edition, and then producing a 
print product based on the news developed in the digital edition. In the case of pure 
digital startups, there is no print edition, and the news is just a continuous stream of 
updates, blogs, tweets, and posts, rather than a fixed article. News articles are time-
stamped, indicating an update is on the way and the reader should return to follow 
the story. Instead of waiting for readers to discover the news, or search for the news 
on a search engine, the news is pushed to readers on any of a variety of venues where 
they happen to be—social media sites, mobile news feeds, Twitter, or Yahoo or Google 
News. Journalists remain paid professionals, but they follow Twitter feeds and social 
media sites, and promote their stories and personas on social media sites. Their job 
is no longer simply reporting and writing, and getting the facts right, but promoting 
and engaging readers on a personal level through their own efforts. Superior reporting 
and writing is no longer the sole criterion for hiring and advancement. More emphasis 
is put on reporters’ abilities to attract audiences on their own social media pages and 
Twitter feeds. 
The Digital First business model is not yet a reality for traditional newspapers. 
The largest print newspaper organizations, such as the Wall Street Journal, New York 
Times, Washington Post, and others, have begun the journey towards becoming Digital 
First news organizations. In 2014 the Wall Street Journal launched its Real-Time news 
desk, a headquarters group of 60 editors aiming to produce a continuous and lively 
flow of digital news and commentary to social media sites, mobile followers, and its 
online sites (Romenesko, 2014). The New York Times also initiated a Digital First model 
in January 2014. In 2015, the Wall Street Journal launched a new digital first website, 
with redesigned web and video pages, iPad and Android apps, and a greater empha-
sis on breaking news stories that are refined in the course of a 24-hour news cycle 
(see the opening case in Chapter 4). In the past two years, the New York Times, the 
Washington Post, USA Today, and Bloomberg News have all made similar changes to 
succeed in a mobile-tablet-desktop digital market place. Most of the major newspaper 
groups have also joined with social media sites like Facebook to have their articles 
appear in newsfeeds. 
Online Newspaper Industry: Strengths and Challenges
The newspaper industry still has some major strengths, which it will need to draw 
upon as it faces the challenges of the future. In the following section, we review those 
strengths and challenges.
Strength: Newspaper Audience Size and Growth.  Online readership of newspapers 
is growing at more than 10% a year. About 67% of Internet users (about 179 million 
people) read newspaper content online, making it the second most popular online

activity (Newspaper Association of America, 2016). See Figure 10.8 for a list of the top 
ten online newspapers in the United States. The online newspaper is one of the most 
successful of all online media in terms of audience size. Mobile newspaper readership 
is especially strong among young persons due to their greater usage of smartphones 
and tablet computers. 
Newspapers have responded to the changing audience by providing access to their 
content on all digital platforms (see Figure 10.9). With 64% of Americans having a 
smartphone and 52% tablet computer, in a few short years newspapers have become 
truly multi-platform by developing apps and websites optimized for mobile devices. 
Only 51% of newspaper readers are exclusively print readers, while 49% use a combi-
nation of the Web, print, and/or mobile. Mobile traffic is continuing to grow for most 
newspapers, while the number of desktop visitors is declining. However, the opposite 
is true with respect to the amount of time spent by visitors, with minutes per visit on 
desktops increasing and minutes per visit on mobile devices decreasing (Pew Research 
Center, 2016). 
Online newspapers also attract a wealthy, educated, and consumer-intense demo-
graphic, reaching 64% of 25- to 34-year-olds, and 75% of individuals in households 
earning more than $100,000 a year on average throughout the quarter. Given the large 
online newspaper audience, it is clear that the future of newspapers lies in the online 
and mobile market even as readership and subscriptions to the traditional print news-
papers continue to decline at a steady pace. 
Challenge: Digital Ad Revenue.  Newspapers hope that the digital ad revolution and 
revenue will hit their shores, and lift total ad revenues. But here’s the problem: while 
Online newspaper readership is expanding rapidly as consumers shift to mobile devices and participate in social networks.

unique visitors to newspaper websites are expanding, increasingly this traffic is less 
valuable for two reasons. First, the audience is increasingly coming from social media 
sites and search engines in order to find specific articles, rather than coming directly 
to the newspaper’s home page (so-called side-door entry). Second, these visitors from 
social sites are less engaged, and less valuable (see Figure 10.10).
The less engaged visitors are in terms of pages viewed, minutes on site, and return 
visits, the less time there is to show them ads and earn revenue. Direct visitors are 
therefore much more valuable and newspapers are hoping re-designed websites and 
apps will increase the number of home page visitors. As a result, growth in digital 
ad revenues at online newspapers has been tepid despite increasing unique visitors, 
growing only about 8% in 2015. In comparison, total digital ad revenue (search, social, 
and display ads) grew at a robust 20% (eMarketer, Inc., 2016e). If current trends con-
tinue, it is unlikely newspapers can rely on growing unique visitors from social sites, or 
growing digital ad revenues, to reverse the revenue declines of the past decade. Instead 
they will need to build on their expanding digital subscription market composed of 
loyal readers who visit the paper everyday for curation and opinion.
Strength: Content Is King.  Why do people continue to buy newspapers and pay for news-
paper content online? The oft-repeated bon mot that “content is king” appears to be true 
in the case of print as well as online content of all kinds, including news and pure digital 
news sites. As in competitive sports, in general, quality counts. The reason why online 
newspapers attract exceptionally large and loyal audiences who are deeply engaged is 
simple: quality of content. Compared to other media, newspapers are the most trusted 
source of news and commentary on local, national, and international stories (Nielsen, 
 
Web-only readership of newspapers remains quite small compared to print only and multi-platform reading.

2013). Local newspapers produce the highest levels of ad engagement: 35% of consum-
ers report making purchases on the basis of local newspaper ads. Online display ads, 
e-mail campaigns, and fleeting mobile ads do not even come close to these engagement 
levels. Newspapers employ about 33,000 full-time professional editorial staff, down from 
about 56,000 in 2000, but still much larger than television, radio, or newer pure digital 
news sources, which obtain much of their content from unpaid bloggers, cellphone 
photographers, and bloggers (Pew Research Center, 2016, 2014b). 
Amateur blogs and tweets may be wonderful for expressing opinions, or making 
instant reports on newsworthy events as they occur, but they are no substitute for pro-
fessional reporters and editors, who make sense out of the constant stream of reports, 
and they are not a place for brand-conscious advertisers who do not want their prod-
ucts associated with low-quality content. Google offers Google News Lab Fellowships 
to journalism students in the stated belief that quality journalism is a key ingredient 
of a vibrant and functioning society. While Internet news giants are dependent on 
newspapers to provide them with content to search and index, newspapers are equally 
dependent on Internet giants for visitors. 
Challenge: Finding a Revenue Model.  In 1995, when the first newspaper websites 
appeared, newspapers offered their content for free, with registration. The hope was 
that advertising would support the website’s operation and provide a new revenue 
stream for the print edition content. In some cases, free content was limited to the 
most popular articles and did not include the classified ads, a lucrative newspaper 
franchise. At that time, print advertising provided over 75% of revenues and subscrip-
tion revenue generated about 25%. 
Newspaper visitors who come to newspaper websites directly in search of news are far more engaged and 
generate more digital ad revenue.

Charging for general newspaper content was an obvious answer, but publications 
that tried this during the 1995–2005 period were punished by an Internet culture that 
expected online content such as music and news to be free. For instance, in 1998, Slate, 
an online magazine owned by Microsoft, began charging its readers a $19.95 annual 
subscription fee (a so-called paywall). There was a free Front Porch section with a 
few articles. In 1999, Slate dropped its subscription fee after only 20,000 readers signed 
up. Some specialized content newspapers, like the Wall Street Journal, were able to 
charge an annual subscription fee ($50 annually) and survive. In a year the Journal 
had 200,000 paid subscribers. Similarly, the Financial Times (London) introduced a 
subscription service in 2001, and in 2007 adopted a metered subscription model, 
which allowed readers to access 10 articles for free, but required payment of a $395 
subscription fee for further access once that limit was exceeded. Both the Journal and 
Financial Times were exceptions to consumer resistance to paying for news, and based 
on a wealthy, focused readership interested in high-value information. 
The introduction of the iTunes store in 2003, and the iPhone in 2007, changed 
the public perception of paid content. While plenty of pirated music was available, 
Apple devices (iPods and later iPhones and iPads) and iTunes provided a high-quality, 
convenient, and legal alternative that users were willing to pay for. In 2016, paying a 
subscription fee for content is the foundation of streaming video and music services 
from Netflix to Pandora. 
In 2011, the New York Times introduced a metered subscription model similar to that 
of the Financial Times, which allowed casual readers to read 20 articles for free, and 
provided unlimited access to current archived content for $35 annually. Print subscrib-
ers received the digital subscription for free. The free-to-print subscribers policy put 
the emphasis on subscription to the Times content, and not to any particular platform. 
This is important because today’s newspaper readers are multi-platform: they read the 
content with a variety of devices depending on the context. A metered subscription 
model is similar to a freemium model: some content is free but ad-supported, while 
unlimited content is only through a subscription. In 2013, the number of free articles 
was reduced to 10, given the success of the metered model, and in that same year, the 
New York Times’ subscription revenue exceeded ad revenue for the first time. In 2016, the 
Times has over 1 million paid digital subscribers. With 43 million online visitors and 30 
million mobile readers, there’s plenty of room for the Times to grow its subscriber base. 
Newspapers (and online magazines as well) have benefited from the changes in 
public perception. Today, 78% of U.S. newspapers with circulations of over 50,000 have 
some sort of charge for online access. Of these, 64% use a metered subscription model, 
12% provide most content for free, but charge a subscription fee to access premium 
content, and 3% use a paywall model (Williams, 2016).
Challenge: Growth of Pure Digital Competitors.  The Web has provided an opportunity 
for newspapers to extend their print brands, but at the same time it has given digital 
entrepreneurs the opportunity to disaggregate newspaper content by creating special-
ized websites for popular content such as weather, classified ads (Craigslist), restaurant 
and product reviews (Yelp), as well as topical national and international news sites 
and apps that compete with online newspapers. Despite the declining revenues of the 
traditional print newspaper industry, entrepreneurs have poured money into news

sites, and even newspapers. Since 2011, Warren Buffett has purchased 28 newspapers 
for an estimated $344 million in a belief that newspapers delivering comprehensive 
and reliable information to small tightly bound communities, and that have a reason-
able Internet strategy, will be viable for a long time (Berkshire Hathaway, 2013). In 
August 2013, Jeffrey Bezos purchased the iconic Washington Post for $250 million in 
the belief that newspapers are not just papers but news gathering and distribution 
businesses independent of any technology or platform (Hagey and Bensinger, 2013). 
While actual print newspapers are attracting wealthy individual investors, venture 
capital investors have poured over $1 billion dollars into purely digital online news 
sites. Table 10.2 describes some leading native digital news sites and their investment 
profile. According to the Pew Research Center, 75% of the digital native news sites it

studied grew their average monthly unique visitors from 2014 to 2015, with the vast 
majority of these sites attracting more traffic from mobile devices than from desktops 
(Pew Research Center, 2016). Figure 10.11 lists the top digital native news sites in 
terms of their unique monthly visitors. 
Not all digital news services succeed, and few, if any, are profitable so far. For 
instance, Digg, a news aggregator site, failed in 2011 despite having 230 million unique 
visitors at one point. 
Challenge: Can Newspapers Survive Digital Disruption.  The newspaper industry would 
appear at first glance to be a classic case of a disruptive technology—the Internet, 
mobile devices, and apps—destroying a traditional business model based on physi-
cal products and physical distribution. Incumbents (the existing print newspapers) 
slowly and incrementally improve their products over time. New firms—disruptors—
introduce new products (Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Vox), which are not as good as 
the incumbents’ products, but are based on newer and more powerful technologies. 
The new products are less expensive, or free, and target underserved or entirely new 
markets. They often are founded and promoted by people new to the industry. Even-
tually the disruptor’s products are improved and become more acceptable, or good 
enough. At this point, the new products and the disruptors start draining significant 
market share from the incumbents who eventually fail. Incumbents fail for a variety 
of reasons, from an expensive legacy production process, large human capital invest-
ments, a contrary culture, and an inability to perceive rapid changes in the business 
Digital native news sites have greatly expanded their unique visitor count and are direct competitors of established newspapers and their 
online editions.

and technology environment. For a description of a news industry startup that may 
have a disruptive impact on traditional newspapers, see the Insight on Business case, 
Vox: Native Digital News. 
Pure digital news sites have many advantages over print newspapers. They don’t 
have the cost of printing papers; they can create new work flows and business pro-
cesses that are more efficient and timely; they have a lower cost structure, often 
relying on user generated content and minimal payments to reporters and bloggers, 
with lower pension costs; and they can take advantage of newer technologies for 
producing the news. While the quality of journalism on these pure digital sites is not 
as good as traditional print newspapers, this situation is changing rapidly as the pure 
digital sites hire talented journalists and editors from print newspapers that are expe-
riencing financial difficulties. 
What online news sites often do not have is credibility and trust. For instance, 
BuzzFeed has been the subject of many lawsuits accusing it of copying content from 
competing newspapers and sites without attribution, claiming the content as its own. 
Without trust and quality, online news sites are simply distractions filled with celebrity 
photos, and there is significant competition for this kind of content. 
If the newspaper industry has a future, it will be online and multiplatform. The 
challenge for newspapers is to create value by focusing on differentiated, timely, and 
exclusive content available nowhere else; to transform its culture of journalism to 
provide a continuous news stream just as its pure digital competitors; and to make this 
content available anywhere, anytime, anyplace, on any device. In short, newspapers 
will have to become Digital First publications, while maintaining their historic quality 
edge, and meeting the challenge from their pure digital competitors. 
MAGAZINES REBOUND ON THE TABLET PLATFORM
The Internet and the Web did not have much impact on magazine sales at first, in 
part because the PC was no match for the high-resolution, large-format pictures found 
in, say, Life or Time. However, as screens improved, as video on the Web became 
common, and the economics of color publishing changed, print magazine circulation 
began to plummet and advertisers turned their attention to the digital platform on the 
Web, where readers were increasingly getting their news, general-interest journalism, 
and photographic accounts of events. Magazine newsstand sales have also declined 
significantly since 2001. Yet special-interest, celebrity, homemaking, and automobile 
magazines remained stable. News magazines like Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News and 
World Report have been the hardest hit. In contrast, special-interest, celebrity, fashion, 
lifestyle, and automobile magazines have remained relatively stable (Trachtenberg, 
2015).
Magazines have responded to declining sales of physical magazines by developing 
digital replica magazines—fairly close copies of the physical magazine. Total revenues 
from subscriptions and newsstand sales of magazine were around $28 billion in 2015, 
down about 4% from 2014 (Sass, 2016). Ad revenues constituted about $18 billion 
of the total. The good news for magazines is that digital ad revenues are increasing, 
and accounted for over $4 billion in revenue in 2015. Unfortunately, print advertis-
ing (about $14 billion) is expected to remain relatively flat through 2020 (eMarketer,

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
VOX: NATIVE DIGITAL NEWS 
Despite an unprecedented array of 
entertainment options, people are 
reading more news online than ever 
before. In fact, reading news online is 
the second most popular activity online. 
Digital news readers are highly engaged 
with both the content and the journalists who put 
the words on the screen. All of this is not lost on 
investors, who have poured over $1 billion dollars 
into native digital news sites (sites without a 
print edition or television franchise) in the last 
few years. 
Vox Media is a prime example of a startup 
media firm grounded in the digital news stream. 
Founded in 2003, Vox Media is a privately held 
company based in Washington D.C. with over 700 
employees. The company has raised $300 million 
in venture capital, including $200 million in 2015 
from Comcast’s NBC​Universal division, valuing 
the company at a whopping $1 billion. Gaining 
access to NBCUniversal’s content distribution and 
production capabilities has helped Vox Media to 
branch out into other forms of media.
Vox Media has pursued a unique strategy 
from the beginning. Rather than creating a single 
digital news site, as, say, traditional newspapers 
have done, and showing tabs for various areas of 
interest (sports, business, or entertainment), it 
instead has unbundled the general news site into 
a number of focused sites, populating them with 
content from hundreds of different blogs that it 
has created or purchased. It started with SBNa-
tion (SportsBlogNation), a collection of 315 
individual sites, most of which focus on individual 
professional sports teams. Each SBNation site has 
its own name, URL, brand, and writers.
Vox Media currently owns eight specialty 
sites, which themselves are often collections of 
blogs or websites, including Eater (food), Curbed 
(real estate), Verge (culture), Polygon (game), 
Racked (fashion), Re/code (tech), and most 
recently, a general news and commentary site, Vox.
com. These niche sites foster much greater inten-
sity of reader engagement. The approach seems 
to be working: Vox Media reached 91 million 
unique monthly visitors in August 2016, with the 
typical visitor being under 35 and with income 
over $100,000 a year. Almost one-third of its 
readership belongs to the coveted age 18-to-34 
demographic.
Vox.com was created in January 2014 when 
Vox hired respected political reporter Ezra Klein 
from the Washington Post. Vox.com pioneered the 
“explanatory journalism” movement by presenting 
news in card stacks rather than long text articles. 
Readers can pursue news in small increments, one 
card at a time, with use of color photos, videos, 
and graphics on the cards. Readers can go as deep 
in the card stack as they want or have time for. 
Vox.com, and other Vox sites that use this tech-
nique such as Curbed and Eater, hoped this new 
format would be more easily consumed by mobile 
readers, differentiate its product from digital 
versions of print newspapers, and also be easily 
placed on social network newsfeeds. This edito-
rial transformation has been viewed as a critical 
success, and has become a major source of new 
readers. 
Vox Media is often regarded as the future 
of digital news publishing because of its technol-
ogy, culture, and business organization. Tradi-
tional newspaper firms typically have a melange 
of technologies, built at different times, to coor-
dinate the flow of news with both print and web 
versions. One of the first priorities Vox pursued 
was to invest millions of dollars in a content man-
agement system (CMS) called Chorus. Chorus 
goes beyond content creation and management 
because it provides the publishing environment 
as well. When reporters and editors are done, 

678	
	
C H A P T E R  1 0     O n l i n e  C o n t e n t  a n d  M e d i a
they can use Chorus to publish formatted 
content to various websites and social media. 
Chorus offers journalists unprecedented levels 
of control and customization, including the ability 
to engage with reader comments and to integrate 
content from others’ stories.
Vox also has a unique organizational struc-
ture when compared to traditional newspapers. 
At Vox, the organization is flat, with fewer middle 
and senior managers. This empowers reporters 
and circumvents the lengthy editorial review 
process at traditional newspapers.
Unbundling news into more focused, vertical 
websites and harnessing technology to reduce the 
cost and improve the speed of content creation has 
been a good start for Vox. But Vox must continue 
to focus on quality reporting while maintaining 
an active presence on the myriad other platforms 
where its audience now gets its news. Whether or 
not Vox will ultimately succeed depends not only 
on whether it is able to attract a large audience 
and enough advertisers, but also on its ability to 
succeed on other platforms, including Facebook, 
YouTube, and even Snapchat.
To that end, Vox has been active in its efforts 
on these platforms, such as its early involvement 
with Snapchat’s Discover service for content cre-
ators. For Discover, Vox creates 10-second info-
graphics combining voiceovers and text to plug 
its latest features. Vox also places heavy empha-
sis on its YouTube channel, which has well over 
a million subscribers and whose most popular 
video has 24 million views. Vox produces high-
quality video content to accompany some of its 
print stories as well as other video content that 
stands alone, with 11 full-time Vox employees 
responsible for video content development. In 
both its YouTube and Snapchat efforts, Vox is 
careful to make content that doesn’t feel like tra-
ditional television or news sources, searching for 
stories that are specifically well suited for video 
and weaving graphics, voiceover, interviews, and 
other techniques together. Much of Vox’s video 
traffic originates from Facebook, where videos 
shared by Klein garner millions more views. In 
2016, Vox launched what it calls its Storytelling 
Studio, which prepares long-form journalism using 
these techniques for particularly notable stories. 
Its first project, an in-depth conversation with and 
discussion of Hillary Clinton, was well received by 
Vox users. Vox also announced plans to create a 
similar team for Snapchat content in 2016. Not 
content to stop there, Vox also announced a part-
nership between Curbed and A+E to develop a 
television show focusing on high-style housing, 
as well as plans to create other television-style 
content for BravoTV.com.
Business analysts also point out that few of 
the digital news sites have generated profits. Most 
of the digital news sites are private and do not 
report revenues or profits. The pure digital news 
sites face the same problems online as traditional 
newspapers do, namely, the declining revenues from 
digital advertising. However, internal documents at 
BuzzFeed, the second most heavily trafficked “new 
media” company behind Huffington Post suggested 
that it was profitable and that its revenues were 
growing signficantly. While the cost of generating 
traffic to these sites is substantial, Vox and its peers 
are continuing their push toward profitability.

Inc., 2016f). The increasing digital revenue is not quite enough to compensate for the 
decline in print ad revenue. One possible solution is to begin charging a subscription 
fee for access to the digital editions, which currently are often free. The New Yorker, 
perhaps the most prestigious magazine in the country, is also one of the most widely 
read, with 1 million print subscribers and 13 million unique visitors to its website. In 
2014, the magazine introduced a metered paywall. Some articles are free, but frequent 
readers will be charged an annual subscription fee (Somaiya, 2014). In 2016, The New 
Yorker launched a new iPhone app called The New Yorker Today that is free to down-
load and use for one month, but thereafter switching to the same metered model used 
for its website. Like newspapers, magazines are experimenting with different revenue 
models in an effort to monetize the rapidly growing tablet audience. Most magazines 
participate in Apple’s iPad Subscription Service, which allows magazines to offer sub-
scriptions from within their app and have the transaction processed by the App Store 
billing system. Publishers set the price, and customers can subscribe with one click. 
Apple keeps 30% of the transaction. Publishers can also direct app readers to their 
website for a subscription, in which case Apple does not make any fee. Virtual store-
fronts such as Google Play have helped publishers grow their digital subscriber base. 
In 2015, Apple introduced its News app. Magazines such as Time and 75 others provide 
articles in an effort to capture a younger, mobile audience (Trachtenberg, 2015).
Despite the shrinkage of print subscription and newsstand sales in the past few 
years, the total magazine audience size increased by over 6% in 2015, due entirely to 
growth of digital magazines, especially mobile web editions, and the percentage of 
adults who read digital edition magazines has more than quadrupled since 2011 (Maga-
zine Publishers Association, 2016). Another study found that over 40% of those sur-
veyed had read an average of 2.5 digital magazine issues in the past month (Mequoda 
Group LLC, 2016). More than 35% of tablet computer owners read magazine content 
once a week, and there are an estimated 1,200 magazine apps for mobile readers.
Popular websites like Pinterest, an image-collecting site that attracts millions of 
viewers, and Facebook, Yahoo, and Twitter are among the largest drivers of traffic to 
digital magazines. The widespread adoption of tablet computers has helped create 
the visual Internet, where glossy magazine publishers, who are inherently oriented 
to richly detailed color photography, can display their works and advertisements to 
great advantage. 
With hundreds of popular online magazines to choose from, magazine aggregators 
like Zinio, Texture (formerly Next Issue Media), Magzter, and Flipboard make it pos-
sible for customers to find their favorite magazines using a single app. A magazine 
aggregator is a website or app that offers users online subscriptions and sales of many 
digital magazines. 
E-BOOKS AND ONLINE BOOK PUBLISHING
In April 2000, Stephen King, one of America’s most popular writers, published a 
novella called Riding the Bullet. This novella was only available as an e-book. King was 
the first major fiction writer to create an e-book-only volume of a new work. King’s 
publisher, Simon & Schuster, arranged for sales online through online retailers such 
as Amazon. In the first day, there were 400,000 downloads, so many that Amazon’s 
magazine aggregator 
a website or app that 
provides subscriptions and 
sales of many digital 
magazines

servers crashed several times. More than 600,000 downloads occurred in the first week. 
While Amazon gave the book away for free in the first two weeks, when it began charg-
ing $2.50 for a 66-page novella—about the same price per page as a standard King hard-
cover novel—sales continued to be brisk. This experiment showed Simon & Schuster, 
and Amazon, that there was a mass market for e-book popular fiction. Previous efforts 
to create a popular e-book had all failed. For publishers, it meant their entire back list 
of older books suddenly had monetary value if they could be sold as e-book editions. 
Ten years later, on April 15, 2010, Amanda Hocking, an unknown and unpub-
lished writer from Austin, Minnesota, uploaded one of her vampire novels, My Blood 
Approves, to Amazon’s self-publishing site, and later to the Barnes & Noble e-book 
store. Her novels had been rejected by many of the publishing houses in New York. 
By March 2011, she had sold more than 1 million copies of her e-books, which gener-
ally sell for 99 cents to $2.99, and earned more than $2 million. In 2012, Hocking was 
listed as one of the Amazon 99 cent millionaires. In 2013, Hugh Howey’s self-published 
science fiction e-book Wool sold more than 500,000 copies and earned him more than 
$1 million dollars in royalties and film rights. Over 40% of Amazon’s top 100 selling 
e-books are now self-published, generating around 14% of e-book revenue. The Big 
Five publishers, in contrast, sell less than 25% of Amazon’s e-books although they 
generate over 40% of the revenue with prices around $14.00/per e-book. Twenty-
three so-called “indie” (independently published) books have sold more than 250,000 
copies, and four Indie authors have sold more than 1 million copies of their books, 
according to Amazon (Authorearnings.com, 2016). Admittedly these success stories 
are rare, and the vast majority of Indie authors in 2016 are unable to make a living, 
let alone $1 million. 
The book publishing industry’s experience with the Internet is very different from 
the newspaper and magazine industries. E-book editions of fiction and non-fiction 
books (so-called trade books) have been very successful, yet printed book sales have 
not collapsed and have remained about the same over time. Professional books, which 
includes college textbooks, remain almost entirely printed for a variety of reasons. 
Book publishing revenues have been stable over the last five years. In 2015, the book 
publishing industry generated just under $28 billion in revenue and sold 2.7 billion 
books (both e-books and printed books). Trade books (general fiction and non-fiction) 
generated $15.8 billion in revenue on sales of about 2.5 billion books (AAP, 2016). 
In the space of a decade, e-books have gone from an unusual experiment by a 
major author, to an everyday experience for millions of Americans, and an exciting 
new market for authors, changing the process of writing, selling, and distributing 
books. E-book sales in 2016 are expected to be $7.6 billion dollars, 26% of all consumer 
book sales. Although e-book sales are expected to continue increasing through 2015, 
e-book sales are not expected to continue to grow nearly as fast as they did in previ-
ous years (see Figure 10.12). Accounting for e-book sales in the mix of total book 
sales is difficult because around 30% of the books sold on Amazon do not have ISBNs 
(International Standard Book Numbers), and therefore, are not counted by the pub-
lishing industry, whose books always have ISBN identifying numbers. Industry-based 
reports on e-book sales only include those published with ISBNs, and indie books 
generally do not have ISBNs (Authorearnings.com, 2016). Analysts estimate that 25% 
680	
	
C H A P T E R  1 0     O n l i n e  C o n t e n t  a n d  M e d i a

of Amazon’s e-book sales result from indie e-books. The industry estimates presented 
here likely underestimate e-book sales. An entire new channel for self-published 
authors now exists, a channel not controlled by the major publishing companies and 
their professional editors. The book distribution market has been disrupted and yet in 
2016 it is apparent that the major publishing firms still maintain their positions as the 
dominant source of book content. In addition, while bookstore chains like Borders and 
Waldenbooks have disappeared and while Barnes & Noble faces earnings challenges, 
small independent bookstores have grown 27% since 2009 to over 2,000 stores. And 
while the Kindle platform unleashed a torrent of indie manuscripts from thousands 
of would-be writers, only a few well-publicized authors have achieved popular success 
and a living income. Unlike the newspaper business, it’s too soon to declare that the 
book industry has been digitally destroyed or wounded, and some reason to believe 
that printed books will continue to be with us long into the future. 
Amazon and Apple: The New Digital Media Ecosystems
Although precursors of e-books and e-book readers began to be introduced in the 1990s 
and early 2000s, it was not until 2007 that the future of e-books was firmly established. 
In that year, Amazon introduced the Kindle, which allowed users to download books 
	 FIGURE 10.12	
E-BOOK SALES

revenues has slowed significantly since 2013.

from the Kindle store using AT&T’s cell network. E-books received another boost in 
2009 when Barnes & Noble introduced its Nook e-reader, and in 2010 when Apple 
introduced its first iPad tablet computer. With its large, high-resolution screen, the 
iPad was an even better e-book reader than the Kindle, albeit not as easily slipped into 
a purse. While Amazon got the jump on Apple in dedicated e-book readers, Apple’s 
approach from the beginning was a multipurpose device that could handle movies, 
music, magazines, and books, as well as having a Wi-Fi connection to the Internet. 
Today, Amazon and Apple together account for 85% of the e-book market, with 
Amazon the leader with a 74% market share and Apple in second at 11% (Barnes & 
Noble’s Nook has experienced declining market share, but still accounts for about 8%) 
(Authorearnings.com, 2015). Amazon’s Kindle Store contains millions of e-book titles 
while Apple’s iBooks Store has over 2.5 million. The result of the Amazon and Apple 
ecosystems, combining hardware, software, and online mega stores, was an explo-
sion in online book content, readership, authorship, marketing, and at least a partial 
upending of the traditional book publishing and marketing channels. Traditional book 
publishing has similarly been altered. In the traditional process, authors worked with 
agents, who sold book manuscripts to editors and publishers, who sold books through 
bookstores, at prices determined largely by the publishers. Because bookstores had a 
vested interest in selling books at a profit, there was only limited discounting during 
clearance sales. In the new publishing model, authors still write books, but then bypass 
traditional agent and publisher channels and instead publish digital books that are sold 
on Amazon or by Apple. Prices are determined by the author, usually much lower than 
traditional books depending on the popularity of the author, and the digital distributor 
takes a percentage of the sale (usually 30%). New self-published authors typically give 
away their early works to develop an audience, and then, when an audience appears, 
charge a small amount for their books, typically 99 cents to $2.99. Marketing occurs 
by word of mouth on social networks, author blogs, and public readings. While a 
small percentage of all books are produced this way, it is a growing and popular form 
of publishing. Although only a very few self-published authors has thus far struck it 
rich, the possibility has been enough to arouse the passions of thousands of potential 
writers of the great American novel, as well as lesser genres from police procedurals 
to paranormal romance writers.
E-Book Business Models
The e-book industry is composed of intermediary retailers (both brick-and-mortar 
stores and online merchants), traditional publishers, technology developers, device 
makers (e-readers), and vanity presses (self-publishing service companies). Together, 
these players have pursued a wide variety of business models and developed many 
alliances in an effort to move text onto the computer screen.
There are five large publishers that dominate trade book, education, and religious 
book publishing. These traditional publishers have the largest content libraries for 
conversion to e-books and they produce over 80% of new book titles in a year. In the 
e-book marketplace, the large publishers started out using a wholesale model of 
distribution and pricing, in part because this is the same model they used with hard 
cover books. In this model, the retail store pays a wholesale price for the book and 
wholesale model

then decides at what price to sell it to the consumer. The retailer sets the price with, 
of course, some kind of understanding with the publisher that the book will not be 
given away for free. In the past, the wholesale price was 50% of the retail price. A 
retailer would pay the publisher a $10 wholesale price and mark it up to a $20 retail 
price. However, retailers could also determine to sell the book at a much lower sale 
price, say $5, as a way to attract readers to the store or as a close-out sale. Brick-and-
mortar stores had a vested interest in selling most books above their wholesale cost. 
With e-books, publishers discovered that some online retailers like Amazon and Apple 
might sell books below cost in order to encourage customers to purchase their e-book 
reader devices or to sell them other goods. 
In the case of e-books, publishers sought to keep their prices high enough so as 
not to discourage sales of hard cover books, which typically sell for $26. Generally, this 
meant publishers wanted e-books to sell at a retail price of $12.99 to $14.99, depending 
on the popularity of the book and the stage in the product life cycle (months since 
first publication). E-book distributors like Amazon were charged a wholesale price of 
about $9 and were expected to mark up the product to around $12.99 to $14.99 or more. 
Instead, Amazon chose to sell e-books for $9.99, at or below cost, in order to attract 
buyers to its content store to buy Kindles, and to attract new customers to its online 
retail store. Amazon lost $1 to $3 on every e-book sold, but recouped the money by 
selling Kindles for hundreds of dollars, and from additional sales of other products. 
With Amazon selling e-books at $9.99, the lowest prices on the Web, publishers were 
forced to sell their e-books on all other websites at the $9.99 Amazon price. Using this 
strategy, Amazon not only sold millions of Kindles but also sold 90% of all e-book titles 
on the Web in 2010 and 2011. Amazon had a near monopoly on e-books.
Publishers opposed Amazon’s policy as debasing the perceived value of both 
physical and digital books, and as a mortal threat to the publishers who could not 
survive if their e-books were priced at $9.99 across the Web. They claimed Amazon 
was engaging in predatory pricing, designed to destroy traditional book publishers. In 
2010, five of the largest publishers secretly met with Steve Jobs and Apple. They agreed 
to a new pricing model called the agency model. In the agency model, the distributor 
is an agent of the publisher, and can be directed to sell e-books at a price determined 
by the publisher, around $14.99 and higher for certain titles. In return for a 30% com-
mission, Apple agreed to support this model, as did Google, neither of whom were 
comfortable watching as Amazon dominated one of the hottest areas of web content 
sales. In these meetings, publishing executives discussed a common pricing strategy.
The agency model temporarily turned the tables on Amazon: it now had to charge 
whatever price the publishers wanted or the publishers would not sell Amazon any 
books (they would not choose Amazon as an agent for their products). A result of the 
agency model was that Amazon’s prices on e-books rose to the publisher desired levels, 
and its market share fell to 60% in 2012. Apple, Google, Barnes & Noble, and the five 
major publishers were delighted. The Justice Department was not delighted: it sued 
the five publishers and Apple for price fixing in violation of antitrust laws. All five of 
the publishers settled, but Apple refused to settle and asked for a trial before a judge. 
In 2013, the United States District Court found that Apple had engaged in price fixing, 
not because of its agency pricing model, which is quite common throughout retail

trade, but because of its “most favored seller” clause in its agreements with publishers, 
which had the effect of discouraging other sites (like Amazon) from selling e-books 
for less than Apple’s iBooks Store price. In addition, the publishers and Apple con-
spired to act in concert, rather than as individual publishers. Under the agreements, 
the publishers, not Amazon, would determine prices on Amazon. If publishers sold 
their books on Amazon for $9.95, then publishers would have to sell their e-books at 
the iBooks Store for $9.95. The court found that Apple and the book publishers’ plan 
would result in less price competition, and higher prices, by enforcing a single higher 
price on all online distributors and e-books. In the field of antitrust, less competition 
and higher prices for all is considered a cardinal violation of the law. After the ruling, 
e-book prices on Amazon have fallen to an average of $9.99, with some older titles far 
less, with limited discounting, and its market share rose to 65%. In August 2014, Apple 
agreed to pay a $450 million fine to compensate consumers for its price fixing behavior. 
While the ruling prevents Apple from fixing prices of e-books, it does nothing to solve 
the issues surrounding Amazon’s dominance of the e-book marketplace. Publishers 
will need to each reach independent marketing agreements with Amazon, one by 
one. Critics of the court case believe Amazon’s market power will force publishers to 
submit to Amazon’s price terms. 
In May 2014, following court rulings against the publishers, Amazon and the 
Hachette group tried to negotiate an agreement on pricing. To demonstrate its market 
power and strengthen its negotiating position, Amazon withdrew all Hachette books 
from its website, leading to author-organized protests. In November 2014, Hachette 
and Simon & Schuster (one of the largest publishers in the United States) agreed on 
terms with Amazon that allow the publishers to set the prices of their books (the 
agency model) but allow Amazon to offer incentives to publishers to reduce prices on 
selected books, and provide for publisher payments to Amazon for listing their books 
(Streitfield, 2014a; 2014b). Today, prices on e-books as a result are highly variable, 
ranging from $9.95 to $16.95. 
The Challenges of the Digital E-Book Platform
Because of the rapid growth in e-books, the book publishing industry is in stable condi-
tion. Yet the industry faces a number of challenges. The early fear of cannibalization, 
namely inexpensive and less profitable e-books replacing more expensive and profit-
able print books, has mostly been put to rest. Unlike the newspaper and magazine 
industries, printed books are surviving in large part because purchasers of e-book 
readers continue to purchase printed books, and switch back and forth from digital to 
print as circumstances merit. For instance, according to Pew Research Center, about 
two-thirds of Americans said they read a printed book last year, about the same as in 
2012. Despite the surge of e-books and digital reading platforms, people still prefer 
printed books (Pew Research Center, 2016b). In the professional and educational book 
markets, e-books have made some inroads, in part due to their lower costs, but for a 
variety of reasons, many students still prefer a physical book to an e-book. Students 
often find the user interface of e-books more difficult to use compared to printed books 
and that it is easier to concentrate when using a physical book, increasing comprehen-
sion and retention. E-books may be like audio books, a useful alternative but not a 
684	
	
C H A P T E R  1 0     O n l i n e  C o n t e n t  a n d  M e d i a

substitute. The falling growth rate of e-books from double-digit to single-digit growth 
may reflect this reality. 
The biggest challenge facing the book publishing industry is control over pricing 
on the digital e-book platforms. As previously noted, Amazon accounts for almost 75% 
of the market, which, while not a monopoly, nevertheless gives it tremendous market 
power. For critics, Amazon threatens to decimate the traditional book publishing indus-
try, replacing the old print world of a small number of publishers, limited numbers of 
titles, independent bookstores, elitist editors in New York, and newspaper book critics, 
with a new digital world of publishing where content is shaped by algorithms identify-
ing what the consumer wants to read about, writers are their own editors, critics are 
replaced by reader comments, and distribution is controlled by one or a few online 
stores (Packer, 2014). Efforts by Amazon to create its own book publishing brand, cir-
cumventing the traditional book publishers, have only worsened relations between 
the world’s largest book store and the world’s largest publishers (Streitfield, 2014c). 
Amazon, as the largest player in the e-book market, offers the biggest challenge. 
This is ironic because Amazon, through its online store and Kindle e-book marketplace 
and reader, has helped the publishing industry to survive the transition to a digital 
marketplace, both by providing the largest book store on earth, and by creating the 
Kindle e-book platform. While the expansion of e-book revenues has offset a small 
decline in print sales, the industry has lost pricing power vis-à-vis its largest distribu-
tion partner, Amazon. 
A second serious challenge is the further evolution of the digital distribution plat-
form. In 2014, Amazon announced Kindle Unlimited, a subscription service where for 
$9.99 a month, customers can read all the books they want. Over 1.4 million titles are 
available, but this Netflix for books does not include any books from the big five pub-
lishers—Hachette, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster, Macmillan, and Penguin Random 
House. Major publishers believe subscription e-book services negatively impact book 
publisher and author revenues. Control over pricing is again the key issue. 
While the book publishing industry has survived in the first era of e-books and the 
digital distribution platform provided by Amazon, Apple, and others, the long-term 
prospects for book publishing revenues and profits remain an open question. 
Interactive Books: Converging Technologies
The future of e-books may depend in part on changes in the concept and design of a 
book. The modern e-book is not really very different from the first two-facing page, 
bound books that began to appear in seventeenth-century Europe and had already 
appeared in the fourth century BCE in ancient China. The traditional Western book 
has a very simple, nondigital operating system: text appears left to right, pages are 
numbered, there is a front and a back cover, and text pages are bound together by 
stitching or glue. In educational and reference books, there is an alphabetical index 
in the back of the book that permits direct access to the book’s content. While these 
traditional books will be with us for many years given their portability, ease of use, 
and flexibility, a parallel new world of interactive e-books is expected to emerge in 
the next five years. Interactive books combine audio, video, and photography with 
text, providing the reader with a multimedia experience thought to be more powerful

than simply reading a book. Apple offers iBooks Author, an app to help authors create 
interactive books, and iBooks Textbooks, a line of interactive textbooks created by 
several of the largest textbook publishing firms. Some experts believe that traditional 
print books will be curiosities by 2025. However, as of 2016, these newer multimedia 
textbooks have not yet been successful in the marketplace. 
	10.3	 THE ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY
The entertainment industry is generally considered to be composed of four traditional, 
commercial players and one new arrival: television, radio broadcasting, Hollywood 
films, music, and games (the new arrival). Together, these largely separate entertain-
ment players generated $144 billion in annual revenue in 2015. This includes both 
digital and traditional format revenues. Figure 10.13 illustrates the relative sizes of 
these commercial entertainment markets. By far, the largest entertainment producer 
is television (broadcast, satellite, and cable), and then motion pictures, followed by 
video games (both stand-alone and online games), radio, and music. While online, com-
puter, and console revenues have grown to be larger than movie box office revenues 
(about $11 billion), total Hollywood film revenues dwarf the game industry when 
other sources of movie revenue are added such as streaming, DVD rental and sales, 
and licensing (total revenue related to motion pictures is $29.2 billion). Radio remains 
a strong revenue producer aided in part by the growth of Internet radio services like 
Spotify and Pandora, but is still largely reliant on FM and AM broadcast technologies,

especially in automobiles. Recorded music is the smallest of the major players at $7 
billion, half of its size ten years ago. 
Along with the other content industries, the entertainment segment is undergoing 
a transformation brought about by the Internet and the extraordinary growth of mobile 
devices. Several forces are at work. Mobile devices, coupled with the easy availability 
of entertainment content now offered by Amazon, Netflix, and many others, have 
changed consumer preferences and increased demand for such content, whether in 
subscription or a la carte pay-per-view forms. Social networks are also spurring the 
delivery of entertainment content to desktop and mobile devices. Social networks 
are rapidly adding video and live video-streaming to their services, as well as provid-
ing a platform for sharing TV and movie experiences. The iTunes store and Amazon 
provide successful download music services where users pay for tracks and albums. 
Music subscription services like Pandora, Spotify, and Apple Music have millions of 
subscribers. Both kinds of services—download and streaming—have demonstrated that 
millions of consumers are willing to pay reasonable prices for high-quality content, 
portability, and convenience. The growth in broadband has obviously made possible 
both wired and wireless delivery of all forms of entertainment over the Internet, 
potentially displacing cable and broadcast television networks. Closed platforms, like 
the Kindle and streaming services like Netflix, also work to reduce the need for DRM. 
Streaming music and video are inherently protected because the content has been 
in the past difficult to download to a computer (similar to cable TV). This situation 
is changing with the advent of streamed video apps like Periscope that can capture 
live video from a PC or TV screen. All of these forces have combined to bring about a 
transformation in the entertainment industries.
In an ideal world, consumers would be able to watch any movie, listen to any 
music, watch any TV show, and play any game, when they want, and where they 
want, using whatever Internet-connected device is convenient. Consumers would be 
billed monthly for these services by a single provider of Internet service. This ideal-
ized version of a convergent media world is many years away, but clearly this is the 
direction of the Internet-enabled entertainment industry, in part because technology 
will enable this outcome, but also because of the emergence of very large-scale, inte-
grated technology media companies like Amazon, Google, Apple, and Netflix. Many 
analysts believe the large entertainment media giants of the future will be technology 
companies that have moved into the production of content. 
When we think of the producers of entertainment in the offline world, we tend to 
think about television networks such as ABC, Fox, NBC, HBO, or CBS; Hollywood film 
studios such as MGM, Disney, Paramount, and Twenty-First Century Fox; and music 
labels such as Sony BMG, Atlantic Records, Columbia Records, and Warner Records. 
Interestingly, many of these international brand names are just now moving to have 
significant entertainment presence on the Internet. Although traditional forms of 
entertainment such as television shows and Hollywood movies are now commonplace 
on the Web, neither the television nor film industries have built an industry-wide 
delivery system. Instead, they are building relationships with tech-based Internet 
distributors like Netflix, Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple, all of which 
have become significant players in media distribution.

ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT MARKET SIZE AND GROWTH
Figure 10.14 shows the current and projected growth for commercial online entertain-
ment revenues for the major players: online TV and movies, online games, Internet 
radio, and online music downloads. Most noticeable is the extraordinary growth of 
online TV and movies, driven in large part by adoption of mobile devices, as well as the 
success of TV and movie streaming sites. Other forms of online entertainment will also 
continue to grow, but at single-digit rates. As the Internet takes on the distribution of TV 
shows and movies, the role (and revenue) of cable television delivery systems declines. 
There will be some interesting changes by 2019. Online TV and movies will grow 
very rapidly (by more than 15% annually), while online games and Internet radio 
remain relatively stable generators of revenue, declining in significance when com-
pared to TV and movies.
TELEVISION
In the television industry in 2016, viewers have gone mobile, Internet streaming and 
downloading distributors like Netflix and Apple have gained market power vis-à-vis 
TV and movie production firms, and cable television systems are losing ground to

PROJECTED GROWTH IN ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT
Among commercial forms of mass entertainment, online TV and movies engage the largest number of people and generate the largest online 
revenues in 2016. By 2019, online TV and movies are expected to account for around 57% of all online entertainment revenues.

Internet and mobile app delivery of content. Streaming services provided by firms 
like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon, and convenient downloading of movies and entire 
TV series, have created powerful alternatives to traditional cable television delivery 
systems. Cable distribution systems are challenged as the Internet offers alternative, 
unbundled, a la carte access to TV programs. Linear TV—watching a TV series over 
an entire season as installments—is being supplanted by binge watching of entire 
seasons online over a few days. This is not possible with linear TV on cable or broad-
cast platforms. Contrary to expectations, the big TV screen in the home is as popular 
as ever, supported by social networks that buzz with chat about what’s on TV right 
now, and Internet-connected smart TVs. In 2016, over 165 million Americans watch 
TV online, over 50% of the American population (eMarketer, Inc., 2016g). Increasingly, 
the TV household is a cross-platform phenomenon. Every day, Americans watch about 
4 hours of TV on traditional TV sets, but spend 5¾ hours online using a computer or 
mobile device. Millennials (ages 16–34) are also avid users of streaming TV services, 
with over 80% of respondents in that age group in a recent survey reporting that they 
watched TV programming using such services (eMarketer, Inc., 2016b). Streaming has 
replaced downloading as the preferred consumer viewing platform. Netflix is the 
market leader in streaming TV and movies, with revenue of $6.7 billion in 2015.
The television industry is in the midst of a transition to a new delivery platform—
the Internet via dedicated streaming devices such as Apple TV, Google Chromecast, 
Roku, and Amazon Fire TV (see Table 10.3), as well as smartphones and tablet com-
puters. As a result, the cable and satellite TV distribution model has been challenged. 
This transition closely follows an earlier but related transition to DVRs and time-

shifting by consumers who no longer were constrained by television executives’ pro-
gramming and scheduling decisions. The current transition to Internet and especially 
mobile delivery of television is not leading to a decline in traditional television 
viewing, which has in fact increased slightly. The new platform is changing how, 
when, and where consumers can watch TV. Cloud computing, the storage and stream-
ing of content from large Internet datacenters rather than on individual personal 
devices, has created a large shift away from ownership of content, and a focus instead 
on access to content anywhere, anytime, from any device as a streaming service. 
Streaming of movies from subscription services has expanded more rapidly than 
buying and downloading of movies. Social networks have enabled a new kind of social 
TV, where consumers share comments while viewing television shows. The most 
important activity in today’s television household may not be what’s on screen, but 
instead what’s being said about what’s on screen. Television rating agencies today do 
not have a methodology for measuring this kind of engagement. 
Expansion of broadband networks, especially those serving mobile devices such 
as Wi-Fi and high-speed cellular networks, and the growth of cloud servers, has enabled 
the growth of a whole new class of television distributors. Cloud distributors, like 
Apple’s iCloud service and Walmart’s Vudu service, allow users to purchase video and 
movies, store them in iCloud, and view the entertainment from any device, anywhere. 
Whereas the dominant way consumers obtained a TV signal in the past was from over-
the-air broadcasters, cable TV, or satellite distributors (so-called linear TV), a new 
“over-the-top” (OTT) channel has developed led by powerful technology companies 
such as Apple, Google, Hulu, Netflix, and many others, all of whom offer consumers 
access to television shows and some full-length feature movies using the household 
Internet service rather than the cable TV service (see Table 10.4). Over-the-top 
(OTT) entertainment services refers to the use of the Internet to deliver online enter-
tainment services to the home. “Over-the-top” refers to the fact that the entertainment 
service rides “on top” of other network services like cable TV and telephone service. 
It’s as if we have a new Internet Broadcasting System with many new players. With 
OTT entertainment, TV does not have to be linear, and consumers do not have to 
purchase a bundle of channels, most of which they never watch.Challenging the 
industry even further, in 2016, the FCC proposed a plan, sometimes referred to as the 
“open set top box plan” that would enable consumers to get rid of cable set-top boxes 
and allow them to access cable channels via streaming TV devices such as those 
referred to in Table 10.3 or through an app on their smart TVs. However, not surpris-
ingly, this plan has met with fierce resistance from the TV industry and cable provid-
ers. 
The Internet and the mobile platform have also changed the viewing experience. 
The best screen when commuting or traveling is the smartphone and tablet. More 
importantly, Internet-enabled social networks like Facebook and Twitter have made 
TV viewing a social experience shared among neighbors, friends, and colleagues. In 
the past, television was often a social event involving family and friends in the same 
room watching a single TV show. The social circle has expanded to include Facebook 
and Twitter friends in different locations, changing television from a “lean back and

enjoy” experience into a “lean forward and engage” experience. Many viewers are 
multitasking: co-viewing shows while texting, commenting, and chatting online while 
the show unfolds. 
While the Internet so far has had an expansive and positive impact on the televi-
sion industry, challenges lie ahead. The largest providers of television in virtually all 
countries are cable television systems that charge consumers a monthly service fee 
for providing service, often accompanied by Internet and/or telephone service. This 
service in the United States costs, on average, about $100 per month per household. 
Cable systems also generate advertising revenues from local and national advertis-
ers. The revenues generated are used to maintain the physical cable network and pay 
program producers (often called cable networks) for their content. For instance, HBO 
(Home Box Office network) creates a variety of television shows for the nearly 11,000 
local cable systems in the United States, and collects fees from local and national cable 
systems like Time Warner and their subscribers. ESPN, the largest sports network on 
TV and the Internet, charges local and national cable systems per-viewer fees. But, as 
discussed in the opening case, with so much video available online from many differ-
ent distributors, many users are thinking about “cutting the cable cord” and just relying 
on the Internet for their video entertainment. Other viewers are “cord shavers,” who 
have reduced their subscriptions to digital channels. Likewise, the improvement in 
over-the-air digital broadcasting of television signals has resulted in a slight increase 
in over-the-air viewers (about 15% of all television viewers). So far, cord cutting and 
cord shaving has been very limited. There are around 100 million pay TV consumers, 
and an estimated 1 million have cut the cord. Millennials are somewhat less likely 
to have pay TV cable service, and spend more time watching TV online than older 
consumers. But these differences also reflect differences in income. The vast major-
ity of Millennials watch TV like their parents by watching ordinary cable television 
(eMarketer, 2016b). Nevertheless, the high service fees for cable television service, 
and expanding Internet capabilities, suggest that cable television growth is over and 
that cable subscriptions will fall. 
FEATURE-LENGTH MOVIES
In Hollywood, the transition to a digital delivery platform is well underway, and the 
industry is poised to maintain its revenue stream based on new digital platforms. As 
consumers have become fully connected to broadband networks on mobile, desktop, 
and home TVs, Hollywood has responded with a host of new viewing options. As a 
result, consumer spending on movie entertainment, whether physical or digital, has 
been stable, with significant growth in several digital platforms. 
The key to the success of Hollywood studios in the digital era is their control over 
original, full-length feature production, and control over who will distribute their 
movies, when, and how. Distributors—whether Internet providers or cable systems—
need to meet the terms of Hollywood studios. The dominance of Hollywood studios 
in content creation is being challenged, but for now still seems secure. An estimated 
120 million Americans will watch movies online in 2016, growing to 145 million in 
2020 (see Figure 10.15).

Aside from box office theater revenues, the movie industry derives revenue from 
both physical formats (DVDs) and digital formats like selling movies for download 
(called Electronic Sell-Through or EST), selling access on cable or the Internet to spe-
cific movies a la carte (called Internet Video On Demand (iVOD)), and subscription 
streaming over the Internet (see Figure 10.16). 
Each of these digital formats has a leading player. The EST download leader is 
Apple’s iTunes store. Consumers purchase and own the downloaded movie. Apple is 
also the leader in iVOD a la carte rentals, but other major players include Amazon, 
Hulu, and cable systems, which also rent movies on demand (usually referred to as 
VOD without the ‘i’ of online video). Netflix is, of course, the leading subscription 
streaming service, both in terms of the number of subscribers and the time spent using 
the service, generating $6.7 billion in revenue in 2015. Streaming has grown faster and 
larger than iVOD, and this is reflected in the market share of Netflix and Apple (see 
Figure 10.17 on page 695). New entrants of significant size include Hulu, premium 
cable television networks such as HBO, Showtime, and Amazon. 
Hybrid services such as Walmart’s Vudu service allow consumers to purchase a 
DVD and then also stream it later from any device. Vudu is enabled by a distribution

HOME MOVIE ENTERTAINMENT REVENUE BY FORMAT

channel called UltraViolet. UltraViolet is an industry-sponsored cloud-based storage 
and proof-of-purchase system. Users enter a code into their UltraViolet online account, 
which gives them access to a movie they have purchased from any device, including 
Android and Apple smartphones. There are an estimated 19 million subscribers using 
UltraViolet. 
Revenue from sale and rental of DVDs has been declining since 2006, sometimes 
at double-digit rates. In 2015, DVD revenue was $9 billion, down a whopping 33% 
compared to 2014. But DVD revenues are still a substantial 51% of total movie rev-
enues. DVDs remain very profitable. The decline in DVD revenues is partially offset 
by the stunning growth of digital formats, especially subscription streaming, which 
grew over 25% in 2015 to $5 billion. Of all the content industries, the movie industry 
has been able to maintain its revenue stream and not be digitally destroyed by new 
technologies, at least for now. 
Hollywood faces a number of challenges as it tries to keep up with a rapidly chang-
ing distribution platform, increasingly digital, streaming, and even mobile. The fastest 
growing digital streaming format does not produce much revenue on a per unit basis.

Studios make about $4.50 on each DVD, but only $2.00 for each VOD downloaded 
movie sale, and only 50 cents for each streamed movie. This means the studios are 
under pressure to keep their new movies in the physical format of DVDs, digital 
theater display, or video downloads, and use the streaming channel (Netflix) for older 
movies that might not sell at any price without the Internet, or have already been 
seen by millions of customers. Hollywood achieves this market segmentation by con-
trolling the “release window” of movies, staggering market release. This is a form of 
price discrimination: those who really want to see the movie as soon as possible are 
willing to pay a higher price. The first tier is the theater box office, followed by DVDs, 
cable video-on-demand, then Internet video-on-demand, and finally subscription 
streaming services. Of course, the longer the studios hold a first-rate movie off the 
Internet, the greater the likelihood it will be pirated. The release window is changing 
under pressure from consumers to release films earlier to streaming and VOD services. 
Release windows are shrinking from nine months to four months, especially for poorly 
performing movies where DVD and box office sales are weak. 
A second challenge involves the growing strength of online movie distributors, 
which may become competitors. Prior to the Internet, distributors such as movie 
theater chains and DVD rental and sales stores were never in a position to create their 
own movies and enter the movie production business. But in the digital era, it is con-
ceivable that distributors like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and Google have the financial 
strength to attempt to make feature-length movies, and reduce their licensing costs.

Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon have already demonstrated their ability to create popular 
TV series. Firms based on streaming are incentivized to produce their own content 
to avoid steep licensing fees demanded by Hollywood studios. For instance, in 2015, 
Netflix had an estimated $9 billion obligation to pay movie studios for content, and 
this accounted for 70% of its operating costs. Therefore, Netflix is investing heavily in 
original content production. Insight on Technology: Hollywood and the Internet: Let’s Cut 
a Deal describes how Hollywood studios and Internet distributors are cutting deals to 
provide more movie content online.
Although the emergence of multiple legitimate sources for streaming and down-
loading movies in a convenient and safe manner appears to have reduced the overall 
amount of piracy, it still remains a threat to the movie and television industry, despite 
years of effort by the industry and government to reduce piracy. In the past, bit tor-
rents and cyberlockers/file hosting sites (like Megaupload) were the most common 
methods of piracy, but today, sites that offer streaming of pirated content have become 
much more popular. For instance, one recent study found that out of a total of almost 
80 billion visits worldwide to 14,000 different film and TV piracy sites, almost 75% 
were to streaming sites, while only 17% were to bit torrent-based sites (Spangler, 2016). 
The monetary amount the movie industry loses as a result of piracy is unknown. 
In the past, the industry estimated that it lost over $6 billion a year in pirated movies 
distributed over the Internet, copied from DVDs, early production copies, and in-
theater videoing (Bialik, 2013). Other academic research estimates the loss is closer 
to $2 to $3 billion in the United States (Danaher et al., 2013). A Google research paper 
found that searches for pirated movies have been dropping steadily, while searches for 
online rentals and streaming are up (Google, 2011). As Google has moved into a closer 
relationship with TV and movie studios, and has its own ambitions to create original 
content, it has strengthened its efforts to reduce access to pirate sites. In 2015, Google 
changed its search algorithm to push pirated movie sites far down in search results, or 
removed sites altogether, making it difficult to find movies through its search engine. 
Insofar as searches are an indicator of consumer interest and intent, the public inter-
est in pirated movies is declining. Services like Netflix and iTunes that permit access 
to streams of movies for a small monthly fee, or download rentals for a few dollars, 
have arguably reduced the motivation to pirate movies for many potential pirates. 
In countries like France, which has passed strong laws to protect artists and dis-
courage illegal downloading (the HADOPI laws), once the laws were implemented, 
sales of movies on DVDs and legitimate downloading sites increased by 25% in the 
following twelve months (Danaher et al., 2013).
Government actions to close down cyberlockers also can have a powerful impact 
on movie sales. In 2012, the U.S. government, along with other governments, closed 
down the world’s largest cyberlocker, Megaupload. In a few days, 25 petabytes of music 
and movies disappeared from the Internet. In 12 countries where Megaupload was 
the most widely used, digital revenues for two movie studios in the study were 6–12% 
higher in the 18 weeks following the shutdown (Danaher and Smith, 2014; Fritz, 2013). 
With few exceptions, the academic literature produced since 2000 shows that piracy 
causes a significant reduction in sales of legitimate movies (Danaher et al., 2013).

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
HOLLYWOOD AND THE INTERNET: LET’S CUT A 
DEAL
All things considered, 2015 was 
a good year for the movie industry. 
Box office receipts were $11 billion in 
North America, up 6% from the previ-
ous year. Global box office sales were also up, 
to $38 billion in 2015, a record, and 5% higher 
than the previous year. Sales in China grew over 
40%. Admissions were up slightly, with 1.32 
billion tickets sold in the United States, and the 
average ticket price and number of films released 
were both stable. Online revenues from download-
ing and streaming continued to increase, to $8.8 
billion (about 31% of the home movie market). 
By any measure, the Hollywood money machine 
has been transformed by the Internet. But, so far 
the movie business has avoided the kind of dis-
ruption that has occurred in the music business. 
People still crowd into theaters to see the latest 
movies, many still rent or purchase DVDs (over 
half of total home movie revenue), and many are 
willing to pay for streamed movies even if they 
are older than what they can see in the theater. 
The reasons why Hollywood has survived the 
disruptive potential of the Internet are complex. 
The Internet has made older movies more valu-
able simply because they can be inexpensively 
stored on cloud servers, are easily discovered by 
consumers, and can be streamed for nearly zero 
cost, producing a new revenue stream. Continu-
ing sales of DVDs, and revenues from online 
streaming services and download sales, drive 
revenues higher for even older movies. Avatar, 
originally released in 2009, now has grossed over 
$3 billion, as has Titanic, released in 1997. More 
recent blockbusters include Star Wars: The Force 
Awakens (2015), which hit over $2 billion in its 
first year, and Jurassic World (2015), which gen-
erated over $1.6 billion. If only all movies could 
produce results like these, Hollywood would be 
golden again. The Internet has made Hollywood’s 
backlist much more valuable. 
But all is not totally well in Tinseltown. 
Once movies are shown in theaters, where Hol-
lywood generates 30% of its revenue, they move 
on to less-profitable venues, from DVDs (which 
are very profitable) to cable television video-on-
demand services, and then to Internet distributors 
like Netflix and Apple for either purchase, rental 
download, or streaming. Internet streaming ser-
vices are low on the Hollywood food chain in part 
because they don’t have the revenues to pay for 
the latest movies. Hollywood prefers to deal with 
Amazon, which sells and rents millions of DVDs, 
or Apple, which charges its customers $12–$14 to 
download recently released movies, compared to 
Netflix, which charges only $8 a month for access 
to thousands of movies. Next in line are cable 
network video-on-demand services, which charge 
anywhere from $5 to $12 a view. Eventually, 
movies end up with cable networks and broadcast 
television stations years after they were released. 
Even cable networks have greatly reduced their 
distribution of feature-length movies and replaced 
them with much less expensive unscripted reality 
shows. This “release window” differs for various 
films based on the studio’s estimate of the revenue 
potential for each film. A very popular film will be 
delayed all along the release window. 
Hollywood is facing several problems moving 
forward to a world where most people will be 
watching movies on the Internet, either at home, 
or on the go, using tablet computers and smart-
phones. One problem is that the fastest growing 
segment of its business, the Internet, is also the 
least profitable. A second problem is that Hol-
lywood does not control its own Internet distri-

698

bution network, but instead is forced to 
rely on the likes of Netflix, Apple, Amazon, 
and Google, each of which attract large online 
audiences. Likewise, the big Internet distributors 
face a content problem: they cannot attract large 
audiences unless they can access recently made 
movies. Old movies and movie libraries on Netflix 
have limited appeal; consumers are looking for 
the latest releases. But Hollywood charges a very 
high premium for recent movies. 
Initially, Hollywood was highly dependent 
on Amazon’s sales of DVDs as rental revenue 
from physical stores declined. iTunes is still the 
largest downloading service of movies a la carte 
(so-called electronic sell-through, or EST). But 
recently, the market dynamics have changed, in 
large part because of Netflix’s success with its 
streaming video model. Why download to own 
when you can subscribe to a steady stream of 
movies? Hollywood is in the enviable position of 
being pursued by Internet distributors who are 
short of high-quality content. This is very different 
from what happened in the music business over 
the last decade. Multiple buyers of movies have 
appeared, not just Amazon or iTunes. Google has 
developed its own streaming media device (like 
Apple TV) that is a platform for movie streaming. 
Hulu is also ramping up again as a distribution 
platform. 
Netflix continues to dominate online movie 
revenues, with a 52% market share compared 
to Apple’s 15%. At one time, Apple had a 70% 
share of Internet movie revenue, and Hollywood 
studios feared Apple would be able to dominate 
Internet distribution and dictate prices. Now with 
Netflix dominating the streaming market, Hol-
lywood fears it will be forced to sell its product 
for a pittance compared to DVD prices. For this 
reason, Hollywood restricts the release of movies 
to Netflix and other streaming services, doling out 
access to recent movies very carefully. Hollywood 
would much prefer that fans download movies 
from Apple rather than wait to rent or stream 
them. To encourage this, Hollywood has created a 
new product called Digital HD that allows fans to 
download high definition copies of movies three 
weeks prior to their release on DVD or video-on-
demand services. There are different versions of 
Digital HD. For example, Disney Movies Anywhere 
allows consumers to pay for recent HD movies 
stored on a cloud server, and play them anywhere, 
anytime. Vudu (owned by Walmart) enables down-
loading of HD movies and digital locker storage 
for play later. Another service, UltraViolet, allows 
consumers to buy a digital copy once, store it in 
the cloud, and view anytime and on any device. 
Amazon’s Digital Copy service enables the pur-
chase of a digital-only movie, as well as a DVD 
with digital copy access. In these ways Hollywood 
can afford to release new movies into digital dis-
tribution channels because consumers are willing 
to pay a premium, or buy the DVD for full price 
and receive a digital cloud copy for “free.” 
Digital HD movies are priced so that they 
produce as much revenue as traditional DVDs. 
This is the first time Hollywood has changed its 
release window strategy in order to drive digital 
download sales. The studios can charge a premium 
price for new movie digital downloads, making this 
outlet more valuable than either the DVD channel 
or the video-on-demand channel offered by cable 
networks. In some cases, movie producers such 
as Disney and Sony have opened up their own 
online stores for selling recent releases directly 
to consumers. This opens the possibility that Hol-
lywood studios can circumvent Internet distribu-
tors entirely. 
More and more, large firms are entering 
the premium video downloading and streaming 
market, competing with one another for Holly-
wood movies and driving up prices. For instance, 
beginning in September 2016, Netflix will have 
the exclusive right to stream Disney, Marvel, 
Pixar, and Lucasfilm titles during the first pay TV 
window, blocking their release on HBO or Starz, 
and keeping them off of Amazon Prime, Hulu, and

699
other streaming services as well. But Amazon and 
Hulu remain major competitors with Netflix for 
movies.
All three competitors have also moved into 
the development of original content as a method of 
reducing their reliance on Hollywood for movies. 
In 2016, Amazon has a total of 36 original TV 
series, a number of which have received critical 
acclaim. It has hired Woody Allen to write and 
direct his own series. Amazon, Hulu, and Netflix 
could be moving into feature movie production 
via the TV series route which is less expensive 
to produce and more profitable to sell. But it’s a 
long way from producing relatively inexpensive TV 
series to full length motion pictures.
In the end, Hollywood and the Internet 
need each other, and the only question is how 
to find the price, define the terms of trade, and 
cut a deal where both parties come out winners. 
The flurry of deals bodes well for consumers and 
probably for Internet distributors and Hollywood 
studios, as well. Given the shift of eyeballs to online 
entertainment, Hollywood is expanding its audi-
ence, maintaining and even enhancing its prices. 
With lots of Internet distributors competing, 
Hollywood gains in power from the competition 
among alternative distributors. Netflix will not 
have a stranglehold over the Hollywood studios. 
How all these calculations will work out remains 
to be seen. Tune in next year on the same channel.

MUSIC
Perhaps no other content industry has been so severely disrupted by the Internet 
and new business models as the recorded music industry. Revenues for the industry 
have been cut in half since 1999. By 2010, revenues stabilized and since then, have 
remained flat. Total U.S. revenues were about $7 billion in 2015. Global sales of music 
grew by 3% in 2015 to around $15 billion, compared to $27 billion in 1999 (IFPI, 2016). 
Digital revenues now make up about 70% of all music revenues (about $4.8 billion) 
(see Figure 10.18). Revenues from CDs continue to decline but still account for 30% 
of the industry’s revenue (about $2 billion). Streaming music sales from ad supported 
streaming and subscription streaming sites now total $2.4 billion, or about 34% of 
industry revenue. Digital revenues have not made up for the loss of revenue caused 
by the drastic decline in CD sales. Revenue from vinyl LP albums grew 32% in 2015, 
to $416 million. Vinyl is escaping the niche market of hobbyists, in part due to its 
superior sound reproduction when compared to digital tracks, and a growing number 
of groups are issuing vinyl editions alongside CD editions although these are only 7% 
of industry revenues. 
For most of its history, the music industry depended on a variety of physical 
media to distribute music—acetate records, vinyl recordings, cassette tapes, and finally 
CD-ROMs. At the core of its revenue was a physical product. Since the 1950s, that phys-
ical product was an album—a collection of bundled songs that sold for a much higher 

price than singles. The Internet changed all that when, in 2000, a music service called 
Napster begin distributing pirated music tracks over the Internet to consumers using 
their PCs as record players. Despite the collapse of Napster due to legal challenges, 
hundreds of other illegal sites showed up, resulting in music industry revenues falling 
from $14 billion in 1999 to around $7 billion in 2015. The appearance of powerful 
mobile media players beginning in 2001 that could be connected to the Internet, like 
Apple’s iPod, and later, the iPhone and iPad, and then the stunning growth of music 
streaming sites, further eroded sales of CD albums. Streaming has fundamentally 
altered the sale of physical music formats because it is no longer necessary to “own” 
a physical unit in order to hear the music consumers want. 
The music industry initially resisted the development of legal digital channels 
of distribution, but ultimately and reluctantly struck deals with Apple’s new iTunes 
Store in 2003, as well as with several small subscription music services, for online 
distribution. By the time streaming music services appeared on the scene in 2006, 
the music industry had dropped its opposition to digital formats, and quickly reached 
agreements with Pandora, Spotify, and others to stream music on their subscription 
and “free” ad-supported services in return for fees. At that time, digital downloads of 
tracks and albums and fees from streaming music services were widely perceived as 
the savior of the music industry, which was losing sales to piracy and file sharing. 
Nevertheless, revenues from these sources pale in comparison to revenues that used to

Music industry revenues have fallen by 50% since 2000, and have only recently stabilized at around $7 
billion. Digital music now makes up about 70% of all music revenues.

be produced by CD albums. Figure 10.19 shows consumer spending on digital music 
in four different formats: singles, albums, streaming, and ringtones. 
While some have argued that Apple’s iTunes music service offering single tracks 
for 99 cents destroyed the sales of albums, this clearly is not the case. Album down-
loads have held up well against single downloads, and actually have grown faster than 
single downloads. For instance, in 2014, Adele’s 25, first released in November 2015, 
sold over 18 million physical and digital copies within six months. Sales of digital or 
CD albums appear to be a function more of the music quality and popularity than 
the format. 
There are two kinds of digital music services, each with a different business 
model: streaming music services and digital download. Streaming music services 
(also known as Internet radio) like Pandora, Spotify, Apple Music, Rdio, Rhapsody, 
and iHeartRadio, deliver music to listeners from cloud servers; the music is not stored 
on user devices. Pandora offers a curated service that allows users to select an artist 
they want to listen to, and then the site uses an algorithm to build a list of artists 
similar to the artist selected by the user. Users do not control what they hear and 
cannot repeat a selection. Spotify allows users to specify artists and songs. Streaming 
music services have two revenue streams: ad-supported and subscription service. Ad-
supported streaming is a freemium model that allows users access to free streamed 
music for a limited number of hours per month and relies on advertising to generate 
Downloads of songs are still the largest component of digital music, but streaming digital music is the 
fastest growing format.

revenue. Streaming music services also typically offer a subscription option, which 
enables users to listen to ad-free music for a monthly fee. However, typically only a 
small percentage of listeners pay a subscription fee, and ad revenues typically exceed 
subscription revenues by a substantial margin. Apple Music does not have free music 
and requires a monthly fee of $10 for ad-free streaming. 
Digital download services (also known as download to own) are exemplified by 
iTunes, Amazon, and Google Play, where users download tracks and albums a la carte 
and pay a fee for each song. Increasingly, the songs are stored on a cloud server so 
users can listen to the music from any of several personal devices. All revenue derives 
from the sale of music albums or single tracks. Digital download is the second part of 
the digital music industry, generating $2.3 billion or 33% of the industry’s revenue. 
While illegal pirated file sharing and downloads of music were the leading edge of 
a digital tide that deeply disrupted the music industry beginning in the 1990s, legal 
digital download and streaming services have put a damper on illegal music piracy. 
Legal digital music sources have saved the music label firms by generating solid rev-
enues and profits, albeit not as generous as in the heyday of CDs. While music labels 
might make $7 on a CD sold at $16, they only make about 32 cents for a single track 
downloaded from iTunes for 99 cents. Digital albums produce about $3.00 for the music 
labels, roughly half of a CD album sale. Artists are similarly impacted, facing a halving 
of their incomes in the digital environment. 
Digital downloads from services like iTunes have declined, and the fastest growing 
segment is the streaming music services. It appears that the success of music stream-
ing services is cannibalizing the sales of downloads, and in 2015 the sales of downloads 
declined by 10%, a trend that started in 2012. With the growth of cloud computing and 
cloud-based music services, the very concept of owning music began to shift instead 
to accessing music from any device, anywhere. However, while music streaming 
services are growing listeners at a torrid pace, few, if any, have managed to earn a 
profit because of infrastructure costs, the costs of acquiring music content from the 
music labels, and freemium revenue models supported by advertising revenues. As 
a result, it is unclear if streaming music services have a viable business model. For 
artists and music label firms, streaming services have little to offer. While music 
labels might receive 32 cents for every iTunes track they sell, they receive only .63 
of a penny on a streamed version of the same song. This revenue is split with the 
artists, who receive .32 of a penny. Rolling Stone calculated that a very popular song 
selling 1 million streams would produce revenue of $3,166 for the artist and a similar 
amount for the music label. For artists, ad-supported streaming pays considerably less 
than subscription streaming. For this reason, many artists and groups refuse to allow 
streaming of their music. 
In 2014, Taylor Swift, one of the world’s most popular singers, pulled her music 
from Spotify’s free service because it pays such a low royalty rate. In 2015, she simi-
larly pulled her album 1989 from Apple’s newly announced Apple Music service 
because Apple was planning to not charge for the first three months of the service. 
Many other singers have withdrawn their performances from free streaming services, 
and there is a growing movement among musicians toward seeking higher compensa-
tion from streaming sites.

The reason for investor optimism is growth. As music streaming sites proliferate, 
and major artists withhold their recent albums, many analysts believe that the music 
industry’s business model is broken, and that streaming will not save the industry. It 
is conceivable that in the future major artists will own their own streaming services 
and charge what the market will bear.
GAMES
In July 2016, the Pokemon Company (partly owned by Nintendo) released its free 
augmented reality game, Pokemon GO for Apple iOS and Android phones (see Figure 
10.20). Pokemon GO overlays exotic monsters on the phone’s screen. The aim is to 
locate, capture, and train these characters. Users are rewarded with stardust (virtual 
currency). The game identifies PokeStops, points of interest or historic locations, 
where users can pick up Poke Balls used to capture Pokemon, and Pokemon gyms, 
where users can train their monsters, capture others, and receive rewards. There are 
plenty of opportunities to buy virtual tools to speed up the capture of Pokemons (Poke 
Balls cost $1 in the store but are free at PokeStops), and advertisers can pay to have 
their streets or businesses become a PokeStop, attracting huge crowds of players and 
potential customers. In one month Pokemon GO became the most popular download 
from iTunes and Google Play. In two months, Pokemon GO had 200 million players 
worldwide and generated over $300 million in revenue. No one knows how long the

Pokemon GO craze will last, but it provides an example of how the online gaming world 
is changing from its initial focus on console and PC desktop gaming to mobile phone 
gaming and professional e-sport gaming as a stadium and spectator sport. 
Console gaming used to be the heart of the digital gaming industry, and still is 
from a revenue perspective. But this changed rapidly with the introduction of smart-
phones and tablets, as well as social and casual gaming, which do not require users 
to purchase an expensive console or packaged software. Smartphones and tablets 
have ushered in an era of free-to-play and $1.99 game apps and much simpler game 
scenarios that do not require millions of investment dollars to develop. Well over 200 
million Internet users play some kind of game online in the United States, and that 
number swells to over 400 million worldwide. In 2016, over 180 million people will 
play games on mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), over three times as many 
who play games on game consoles. Casual PC gamers are twice as common as console 
gamers (see Figure 10.21) (eMarketer, Inc., 2016c; PriceWaterhouseCoopers, 2016). 
In the United States, revenue from digital games in all formats (mobile, PC based, 
massive multiplayer, social, and console) in 2015 was estimated at nearly $18 billion

(PriceWaterhouseCoopers, 2016). To put this in perspective, the $18 billion game sector 
is about one-half of the total Hollywood movie sector, and about twice the size of all 
digital music revenue in 2015. 
There are five types of digital gamers. Casual gamers play games on a desktop 
or laptop computer. They are called casual gamers because they play games for a 
few minutes at a time, stop and start games, and are not intensively involved. Social 
gamers are those who play games using a web browser or app on a social network like 
Facebook, often with friends. Mobile gamers play games using their smartphones or 
tablet computers. Mobile gamers are casual gamers as well, with fleeting involvement. 
Massively multiplayer online gamers (MMO) use their computers to play with a large 
number of players around the globe. Console gamers play games online (or offline) 
using a dedicated console like Xbox, PlayStation, or Wii. Often, console gamers are 
connected over the Internet to enable group play. 
While many more people play mobile and desktop games online, more than half of 
the $18 billion online gaming revenue is generated by console gamers, largely through 
the purchase of expensive physical games on DVDs or online digital downloads of the 
games, which in 2015 accounted for about $9.6 billion in revenue. PC games generated 
around $3.7 billion, about one-quarter of total revenues. Mobile games generated an 
estimated $3 billion (PriceWaterhouseCoopers, 2016). In terms of the future, overall 
game revenues are expected to grow by 30% to 2020. 
The rapid growth in the number of people playing mobile games based on tablets 
and smartphones is a sea change for the gaming industry that was previously domi-
nated by closed-platform console games and hardware firms like Microsoft, Nintendo, 
and Sony, and software firms like Activision and Electronic Arts. The growth of smart-
phones, tablets, and mobile games has catapulted Apple’s App Store and the Google 
Play store into the leading merchants of digital games, which, of course, use Apple and 
Google Android hardware and software. Apple and Google take 30% of game sales and 
also benefit from the sales of the hardware and software needed to play the games. 
Mobile games appeal to a younger demographic, offer lower prices, and initially are 
often free. You can play mobile games anywhere you can use a phone, which is nearly 
everywhere. Console games take much longer to develop, have very large budgets, 
and are expensive to purchase. 
The mobile platform is a more open platform that allows thousands of developers 
to create entertaining games on much smaller budgets, as well as new and innovative 
games on a faster schedule. In contrast, the console platform has evolved much more 
slowly than mobile computing. In 2014, a new Sony PlayStation replaced a seven-
year-old model, and a new Microsoft Xbox replaced an eight-year-old model. In a 
fast-moving online world, such long replacement cycles inevitably lead to declines in 
hardware sales, and limit software innovation. While console, PC, and online social 
games will continue to grow their audience size slowly, the fastest audience growth in 
the future will be in mobile games that can be played anywhere and anytime. 
One solution to PC and mobile game revenue growth is likely to be professional 
gaming, otherwise known as e-sports. E-sports, like other professional sports, is based 
on competition among teams of players. The competition at the championship level 
takes place in auditoriums attended by thousands of fans, and is watched by millions

more on the Internet. In August 2015, for instance, 11,000 fans packed into Madison 
Square Garden in New York to watch 10 professional players play the online game 
League of Legends (Needleman, 2015). The International 2016 Tournament in Seattle 
has a prize pool of $20 million, and the events can draw participants equal to profes-
sional football games, including millions of online and TV viewers. 
The games are broadcast over cable television channels, but more commonly 
over Internet channels like Twitch.tv. Twitch accounts for over 80% of online e-sports 
viewing in the United States, and was purchased by Amazon in 2015 for $1.1 billion. 
Twitch.tv draws peak-time audiences of over 1 million viewers in 2016, as many as 
MTV, TruTV, and MSNBC, to name a few cable networks. Other broadcasters include 
YouTube and Dailymotion. 
The organization of the tournaments, and the prize money for the players, is pro-
vided by the games’ publishers. The leading publisher of PC games played at profes-
sional levels is Riot Games, publisher of League of Legends, a multiplayer online battle 
game. There are twenty League of Legends professional teams that compete with one 
another. The league requires teams to hire professional video game coaches. Other 
multiplayer games suited to arena play include StarCraft II and Call of Duty. 
Advertisers are attracted to e-sports because the audience is predominantly com-
posed of young males between the ages of 21 and 34, who are hard to reach using 
traditional media. Coca Cola, Nissan, Ford, and Google are among the largest sponsors 
of e-sports. College teams have sprung up across the country, including Harvard and 
Princeton, and Robert Morris University in Chicago now offers several scholarships 
for students who will play on its video game team (Wingfield, 2014). At current rates 
of growth, e-sports will approach Hollywood in terms of global revenues, and eclipse 
console game revenue by 2020, transforming online gaming into a popular sport.

How Does This Movie End? 
I
n the Netflix online television comedy-drama series, Orange is the New Black, 
the lead character is Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), a recently engaged 
blond New Yorker sent to a federal prison for a crime committed years before. 
Critically acclaimed, and widely followed, Orange follows in the footsteps of 
Netflix’s earlier successful online TV series House of Cards, a political insider’s tale 
of Washington politics starring Kevin Spacey. House of Cards was the first-ever online 
television series to win an Emmy award (for best director). Orange won three Emmy 
creative awards in 2014. In 2014, Netflix racked up 31 nominations, and in 2015, 34 
nominations. In 2016, the number soared to 56 nominations, making Netflix the third 
leading platform/network behind HBO (96) and FX Networks (38). Besides returning 
series like Orange is the New Black, its new series Making a Murderer and the docu-
mentary What Happened, Miss Simone? each scored six nominations. Netflix is quickly 
becoming the non-cable alternative to cable TV. By producing its own content, Netflix 
is able to differentiate itself from cable TV shows and attract new subscribers looking 
for new shows, not retreads from the cable networks. However, original productions 
are much more expensive to produce than licensing existing content. 
While Netflix does not release the number of viewers for any of its original TV 
shows, executives credit these shows with driving the streaming service to a record

83 million worldwide subscribers by the second quarter of 2016 (45 million in the 
United States where 60% of its subscribers come from). In 2016, Netflix announced its 
presence in all foreign markets except China, and that it had gained 3.5 million new 
subscribers outside the United States. Its goal is to hit 100 million subscribers by 2017. 
Its subscriber growth rate in the United States has slowed considerably in the last few 
years because its market penetration is so high. Netflix shares have increased by over 
8,000% since it first went public in 2002, but it has hit a rough spot in 2016, with the 
stock market punishing the company for failing to achieve expected subscriber growth 
targets in the United States, amid concerns about growing competition in the stream-
ing marketplace. Many subscribers dropped the service in 2016 because Netflix raised 
its prices and Amazon grew its own video streaming service. It is currently selling at 
over 300 times its projected earnings, much more expensive than Google, Facebook, 
or other tech companies because it is still perceived as a growth company. Revenues 
in 2015 were $6.7 billion, up 22% from 2014, but profits were a paltry $122 million, 
less than half the previous year. Netflix’s profit margin is less than 2%, far less than a 
retailer like Walmart (4% margin). 
Netflix got its start as a mail order company renting DVDs of older Hollywood 
movies using the postal system. Founded by two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Marc 
Randolph and Reed Hastings, in 1997, the company started by renting individual 
copies of 900 DVD movie titles and delivering them to customers by postal mail. In 
2000, it switched to a subscription model where customers could receive DVDs on a 
regular basis for a monthly fee. By 2006, it had delivered its billionth DVD and became 
the largest subscription provider of DVDs. In 2007, Netflix began a video-on-demand 
streaming service of movies although it still retains a DVD subscription business. In 
2016, Netflix is the largest player in the movie and TV series streaming market, and 
consumes over 35% of the U.S. Internet bandwidth to serve its customers. 
Netflix is one of those Silicon Valley stories that might make a good movie, or 
even a television series, because of its potential for disrupting the American televi-
sion and movie landscape (or what’s called premium video). It’s a dream-come-true 
story of accomplishment, pluck, innovation, and Internet technology. In a few short 
years Netflix created the largest DVD rental business in the country, then created 
the largest streaming video service. Today Netflix accounts for over 90% of digital 
movie streaming, while its chief streaming competitors, Amazon and Hulu, make up 
the remaining market. Netflix has created the largest database on consumer video 
preferences and built a recommendation system that encourages consumers to see 
more movies. Netflix is as much a technology company as a content company: it has 
developed its own proprietary video encoding system and distributes its video using 
over 1,000 servers in the United States located close to its customers to ensure high 
speed and quality delivery. Netflix discovered that older TV series had strong niche 
followings and built a new model of “binge watching” where consumers could watch 
all the episodes of a series in several sittings. Netflix has entered the content creation 
business by developing original TV series. For this reason, Netflix is an example of con-
vergence in the media industry where an Internet company becomes a media content 
producer. Other pure media companies have taken notice and begun to develop their

own streaming services, but what they lack is a database of viewer preferences that 
Netflix has developed over a ten-year period and which helps Netflix make recom-
mendations to subscribers.
In the movie and TV business there are only two ways to make money: either own 
the content or own the pipes that deliver the content. All the better if you can do both. 
Netflix has become recognized as an important pipeline to a very large audience. For 
instance, Netflix has a deal with the Weinstein Company, a major American film studio 
and producer of ten Academy Award films, to become the exclusive subscription TV 
home for the film studio’s content, beginning in 2016. This move puts Netflix into the 
same league of premium channel distributors and in direct competition with other 
cable networks like HBO, Starz, Showtime, and A&E for the rights to show movies 
about eight months after their theater run is complete. Netflix also has a deal with 
Warner Brothers to be the exclusive Internet distributor of the Batman prequel Gotham, 
and with Twenty-First Century Fox in 2016 for the FX series American Crime Story.
In one possible ending scenario for the Netflix movie, the company challenges the 
much larger cable television industry, which is based on an entirely different technol-
ogy and business model, namely, selling expensive bundles of hundreds of TV chan-
nels that few people watch, then raising monthly fees faster than the rate of inflation. 
Given Netflix’s large national audience of streamers, the company makes new friends 
in Hollywood and New York that are looking for ways to distribute their shows to a 
new online, mobile, and social world; Hollywood stretches the distribution window 
so that Internet distributors like Netflix get the same treatment as cable systems by 
allowing them to show the latest movies and shows at about the same time as cable 
systems. And the cable television industry is forced to retreat from its bundling prac-
tices and offer customers the ability to select just those channels they actually watch. 
Cable industry revenues plunge as a result. In this dream scenario, Netflix goes on 
to challenge the cable networks by producing its own original TV dramas, and adds 
comedy and documentaries to the mix. A story with a happy ending for Netflix! But 
happy endings happen mostly in Hollywood. 
The outcome of this movie depends on how well Netflix can deal with some 
considerable challenges. For instance, one source of Netflix’s poor profitability is 
that the costs of content are very high, both purchased older series as well as new 
content, which is far more risky. The owners of older cable TV series and Hollywood 
movies charge Netflix for the privilege of distributing their content as much as they 
do established cable TV networks. In 2016 Netflix reported streaming content obliga-
tions to content producers of $12 billion! With $6.7 billion in gross revenue, it paid 
out $5.7 billion in payments to content owners (mostly cable networks) and produc-
tion studios for original content. Netflix barely makes any profit. Netflix is, after all, 
mostly a database and delivery platform, and the company is in a constant bidding 
war with both cable and Internet giants all looking for the same thing—popular TV 
series with a built-in or potential audience. But content owners have wised up to the 
value of their backlist TV series and have raised their prices accordingly. Series just 
a year old are very expensive or non-existent. Netflix is paying hundreds of millions 
to Disney, Paramount, Lionsgate, and MGM to license hit shows and movies. As a

result of content owners charging more for older cable shows, Netflix has taken the 
more risky option of developing its own original series. But this is very expensive as 
well. The critically acclaimed House of Cards cost Netflix $100 million for 26 episodes, 
$4 million an episode. Newer shows like Between, Narcos, and Bloodline are running 
around $20 million a season. It’s possible that Netflix does not scale, and that the more 
subscribers it has and the more it attracts them with original expensive content, the 
less profit it makes because the cost of doing business rises faster than revenue. 
A second challenge Netflix faces is the risk of creating new content. It’s not as 
if wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneurs can fly to Hollywood or New York with lots 
of cash and simply purchase new content. As one pundit noted, this might lead to a 
mugging, but not a successful TV series or movie. Silicon Valley is generally not the 
place to go if you’re looking for story tellers, writers, producers, directors, talent agents, 
and cinematographers. Algorithms don’t come up with new ideas for novels, plays, 
movies, or TV series, and they have not proven to be good at guessing what series 
will succeed in the future. Older series are proven series, and Netflix can identify 
which of its customers watched the series in previous years, and estimate the audi-
ence size, and whether new subscribers will be attracted by the re-plays. But when 
it comes to new TV series, Netflix has tried to use its algorithms to predict what new 
series its customers might be interested in with mixed results. Netflix has produced 
some real winners according to critics, but it has also produced some losers that 
did not get critical acclaim like Lillyhammer, Hemlock Grove, Bad Samaritans, Richie 
Rich, and Mitt. There has been only one tech company in history that was successful 
with content production for movies or television, and that is Pixar, which pioneered 
computer-generated animated feature-length movies. It is impossible to know how 
well Netflix’s original content is performing because the company refuses to release 
this data. Nielsen has begun a rating service for Netflix shows. This service is paid for 
by the content producers who will base their charges in part on how many Netflix 
subscribers stream their shows. 
While Netflix stands out as a powerful Internet brand today, Netflix has many pow-
erful competitors. Netflix does not have unique technology. In fact, streaming technol-
ogy is widespread and well understood. The success of Netflix’s streaming model has 
attracted Amazon, Apple, Yahoo, Google, and content producers like Hulu and HBO 
to the fray. In 2015, Verizon announced a free, ad-supported mobile streaming service 
call go90, aimed at Millennials who routinely watch video on their smartphones. Some 
of these firms are tech firms with very large Internet audiences, strong brand names, 
and a good understanding of what their millions of online customers want. 
Apple is the leader in downloaded movies where customers own or rent movies, 
and of course, it owns iTunes, the world’s largest online media store for the purchase of 
music, videos, and TV series. HBO, founded in 1972, is the oldest and most successful 
pay television service in the United States with over 140 million cable TV subscribers 
worldwide, and the originator of a long list of highly successful original TV series and 
movies such as Sex and the City, The Sopranos, The Wire, Game of Thrones, and True 
Blood. If Netflix has a direct competitor on the creative front, it is HBO, a more tradi-
tional programmer that does not use computer algorithms to design its content, but

instead relies on the hunches and gifts of editors, producers, and directors to produce 
its content. 
Netflix’s competitors have very deep pockets. This means Netflix also has competi-
tors for talent and the production of new content, and perhaps price pressure as well. 
Along with Hulu, Amazon has emerged as the biggest competitor to Netflix streaming. 
For instance, Amazon offers free streaming to its 60 million Amazon Prime customers, 
and has taken on HBO TV series to stream to Prime customers without additional fees. 
Amazon has also moved into original series production with The Man in the High Castle, 
Transparent, Mozart in the Jungle, and others, winning 16 Emmy awards in 2016. Apple 
iTunes and Amazon have far larger databases of subscribers and their preferences. 
Google is actively pursuing long-form content creators for its video channel program. 
There is no cost to Google users because the service is ad supported. 
So another possible ending for the Netflix movie is that ultimately it can’t compete 
with Apple, Google, Yahoo, Hulu, and Amazon, or the content producers like CBS and 
HBO Now, which have started their own streaming services. Generating a negative 
cash flow of $1 billion a year, Netflix may run out of investors who make up the dif-
ference. Netflix can be imitated by its competitors, and its profitability reduced to less 
than shareholders can tolerate. Apple’s 2015 revenue was a staggering $234 billion, 
30 times larger than Netflix, and it has a cash reserve of $234 billion. It is entirely 
within Apple’s capabilities, or Amazon’s or Google’s, and others to develop a competing 
streaming video service. Equally worrisome, major cable networks like CBS and NBC 
have started their own streaming networks for their original content. In July 2016, Wall 
Street finally got the message that Netflix was facing a slew of streaming competitors, 
and its stock fell over 30%. Netflix may have created a new world of streaming, binge-
ing, and content production, but it may not be able to survive the world it created. 
This show is not over until the last episode is finished. Stay tuned.

	10.5	 REVIEW
K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Understand the major trends in the consumption of media and online content, the major revenue models for digital 
content delivery, digital rights management, and the concept of media convergence.
•	
Major trends in the consumption of media and online content include the following:
•	
The average American adult spends around 4,300 hours per year consuming various media. The 
most hours are spent online, using a desktop or mobile device, followed by watching television and 
listening to the radio.
•	
Although several studies indicate that time spent on the Internet reduces consumer time available 
for other media, recent data reveals a more complex picture, as Internet users multitask and con-
sume more media of all types than do non-Internet users. 
•	
In terms of all media revenue, television and home video accounted for about 34% of media rev-
enues, print media (books, newspapers, and magazines) for 32%, video games, 9%, box office, 9%, 
Internet media (online music and video), 8%, and music (radio and recorded music), 8%. Internet 
media, while relatively small now, is growing at 12% annually, far faster than traditional media rev-
enues.
•	
The three major revenue models for digital content delivery are the subscription, a la carte, and 
advertising-supported (free and freemium) models.
•	
In terms of paid online content, online TV and movies is the largest and fastest growing form of 
online entertainment.
•	
Digital rights management (DRM) refers to the combination of technical and legal means for protect-
ing digital content from reproduction without permission. Walled gardens are a kind of DRM that 
restrict the widespread sharing of content.
•	
The concept of media convergence has three dimensions:
•	
Technological convergence, which refers to the development of hybrid devices that can combine the 
functionality of two or more media platforms, such as books, newspapers, television, radio, and ste-
reo equipment, into a single device.
•	
Content convergence, with respect to content design, production, and distribution.
•	
Industry convergence, which refers to the merger of media enterprises into powerful, synergistic 
combinations that can cross-market content on many different platforms and create works that use 
multiple platforms.
•	
In the early years of e-commerce, many believed that media convergence would occur quickly. 
However, many early efforts failed, and new efforts are just now appearing.
Understand the key factors affecting the online publishing industry.
•	
Key factors affecting online newspapers include:
•	
Audience size and growth. Although the newspaper industry as a whole is the most troubled part of 
the publishing industry, online readership of newspapers is growing, fueled by smartphones, e-read-
ers, and tablet computers.
•	
Revenue models and results. Online newspapers predominantly rely on both advertising and subscrip-
tion revenues. Digital ad revenues are not sufficient to cover losses in print advertising.
•	
Key factors affecting online magazines include:
•	
Online audience and growth: Digital magazine sales have soared, with almost a third of the Internet 
population now reading magazines online.
712	
	
C H A P T E R  1 0     O n l i n e  C o n t e n t  a n d  M e d i a

•	
Magazine aggregation: Magazine aggregators (websites or apps) offer users online subscriptions and 
sales of many digital magazines.
•	
Key factors affecting e-books and online book publishing include:
•	
Audience size and growth. E-book sales growth has leveled off following an explosive growth period. 
Growth today is fueled by the Amazon Kindle, Apple iPad, and smartphones. The mobile platform of 
smartphones and tablets has made millions of books available online at a lower price than print 
books. The future of the book will be digital although printed books are unlikely to disappear in the 
foreseeable future.
•	
Challenges. The two primary challenges facing e-book publishing are control over pricing and the 
continued evolution of the e-book model, including rentals and subscription services. 
•	
Competing business models. E-book business models include the wholesale model and the agency 
model.
•	
Convergence. The publishing industry is making steady progress toward media convergence. Newly 
authored e-books are appearing with interactive rich media, which allow the user to click on icons 
for videos or other material, and take notes. 
Understand the key factors affecting the online entertainment industry.
•	
There are five main players in the entertainment sector: television, motion pictures, music, games, and 
radio broadcasting. The entertainment segment is currently undergoing great change, brought about by 
the Internet and the mobile platform. Consumers have begun to accept paying for content and also to 
expect to be able to access online entertainment from any device at any time.
•	
Key factors include the following:
•	
Audience size and growth. The audience for online movies and television is growing dramatically.
•	
The emergence of streaming services and the mobile platform. In the movie and television industries, 
two major trends are the move to streaming services, from Amazon and Apple to Hulu and other 
channels, and the continued increase in online purchases and rentals. Although physical sales of 
products (DVDs) are dropping significantly, more and more consumers are purchasing or renting 
movies and television episodes on mobile devices. 
•	
The music industry is experiencing similar trends as the movie industry: the growth of streaming 
services, or Internet radio, the continued decline of online purchases, and increased downloads on 
mobile devices. However, the unbundling of a traditional music product, the album, into individual 
songs, and the growth of streaming, have decimated music industry revenues. 
•	
The greatest growth is anticipated in mobile gaming, as the mobile market is rapidly expanding 
along all e-commerce fronts.

P R O J E C T S
	 1.	 Research the issue of media convergence in the newspaper industry. Do you believe that convergence 
will be good for the practice of journalism? Develop a reasoned argument on either side of the issue 
and write a 3- to 5-page report on the topic. Include in your discussion the barriers to convergence and 
whether these restrictions should be eased.
	 2.	 Go to Amazon and explore the different digital media products that are available. For each kind of digital 
media product, describe how Amazon’s presence has altered the industry that creates, produces, and 
distributes this content. Prepare a presentation to convey your findings to the class. 
	 3.	 Identify three online sources of content that exemplify one of the three digital content revenue models 
(subscription, a la carte, and advertising-supported) discussed in the chapter. Describe how each site 
works, and how it generates revenue. Describe how each site provides value to the consumer. Which 
type of revenue model do you prefer, and why? 
	 4.	 Identify a popular online magazine that also has an offline subscription or newsstand edition. What 
advantages (and disadvantages) does the online edition have when compared to the offline physical 
edition? Has technology platform, content design, or industry structure convergence occurred in the 
online magazine industry? Prepare a short report discussing this issue.
	 5. 	 In 2014, Amazon purchased Twitch, which lets users stream their video game sessions, for almost 
$1 billion. Why would Amazon spend so much money on Twitch? Create a short presentation either 
defending the purchase or explaining why you think it was a bad idea.

Social Network Fever
Spreads to the Professions 
W
hen social networks first appeared 
a decade ago, it was widely believed 
the phenomenon would be limited to 
crazed teenagers already captive to online games and 
video game consoles. Most of the technorati in Silicon 
Valley and Wall Street felt this was a blip on the horizon, 
and their full attention was occupied by search engines, 
search engine marketing, and ad placement. But when 
the population of social network participants pushed into 
the hundreds of millions, even the technical elite woke 
up to the fact that these huge audiences were not just 
a bunch of teenagers. Instead, a wide slice of American 
society was participating. Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s CEO 
at the time, expressed the conviction as early as 2007 that social networks would have 
some staying power, although he tempered that outlook with reservations about just how 
long that would be, given their youthful appeal and faddish nature. This was just before 
Microsoft paid $250 million for a small stake in Facebook, which valued the company at 
$15 billion. Trying to sound convincing, the month before his company spent $1.65 billion 
for YouTube, Google CEO Eric Schmidt asserted his belief that despite prevailing opinion, 
social networks were a bona fide business opportunity.
Today, the social network craze has taken a firm hold. In addition to the hugely popular 
social networks aimed at the general population, such as Facebook, which now has over 
1.7 billion active monthly users worldwide, there are a number of social networks aimed 
at more specific groups. Take LinkedIn, for example, probably the best-known and most 
popular business network site. LinkedIn has more than 450 million members in over 
200 countries, representing 170 different industries. In 2016, according to LinkedIn, it 
typically has around 110 million monthly unique visiting members, including about 60 
million who visit using a mobile device. In May 2011, LinkedIn went public in what was, 
at the time, the biggest Internet IPO since Google, raising more than $350 million and 
giving it a company valuation of $8.9 billion. In 2016, Microsoft acquired LinkedIn for 
a whopping $26.2 billion. Although the price tag gave many analysts pause, the acquisi-
tion is a logical fit, giving Microsoft a long-desired social media presence as well as a 
tool to promote its Microsoft Office programs to professional audiences. LinkedIn’s stock 
price rebounded from 3-year lows in the wake of the news, and reached $192 per share 
in September 2016. LinkedIn allows a member to create a profile, including a photo, to 
summarize his or her professional accomplishments. Members’ networks include their con-
nections, their connections’ connections, as well as people they know, potentially linking 
them to thousands of others. How members use LinkedIn depends somewhat on their

position. Top executives use the site to promote their businesses, while job seekers use 
the site to find a new position. Firms looking for new hires use the site as an important 
source of professional talent. LinkedIn hopes that its more influential users will make 
use of its retooled LinkedIn Publishing blogging platform to connect with audiences. And 
in response to the increase in freelance jobs and growth in the “gig economy,” LinkedIn 
unveiled its ProFinder marketplace in 2016, which allows consumers to find independent 
service providers for part-time or temporary jobs.
Those with a particular interest in the stock market can choose from a crop of financial 
social networks that allow users to connect with other investors, discuss issues focused on 
the stock market, and sometimes just show off investing prowess. For example, Stockr is a 
community where stock investors exchange ideas and track the performance of financial 
bloggers. The Motley Fool, one of the best-known online stock investment services, started 
its CAPS stock-rating social network in 2006 and now has over 180,000 members.
You can find similar social networks for a variety of specific professional groups such 
as health care (DailyStrength), law (LawLink), physicians (Sermo), human resources (Hr.
com), and Quibb (technology professionals). These social networks encourage members to 
discuss the realities of their professions and practices, sharing successes and failures. The 
rapid growth of professional social networks, linked to industry and careers, demonstrates 
how widespread and nearly universal the appeal of social networks is. What explains the 
very broad attraction to social networks? E-mail is excellent for communicating with 
other individuals, or even a small group. But e-mail is not very good at getting a sense of 
what others in the group are thinking, especially if the group numbers more than a dozen 
people. The strength of social networks lies in their ability to reveal group attitudes and 
opinions, values, and practices.
Professionals who join social networks need to be careful about the content they 
provide, and the distribution of this content. As business social networks have grown, 
and as the number of participants expands, employers are finding them a great place to 
discover the “inner” person who applies for a job. A 2016 survey by CareerBuilder, the 
most widely used employment site in the United States, found that 60% of employers 
use social networks to screen job candidates, a large increase from 52% in 2015 and a 
far cry from the 11% recorded in 2006. The survey found that 49% of hiring managers 
who use social media to vet candidates discovered information that led them not to hire 
an applicant, such as provocative material posted by the candidate, information about 
the candidate drinking or using drugs, or criticism by the candidate of former employers. 
On the other hand, 32% of managers found information that led them to hire someone, 
such as evidence of a professional image, well-rounded personality, creativity, and good 
communication skills. Based on this survey, it’s wise to use social networks’ maximum 
privacy settings and release to the public only the most innocuous content. Likewise, be 
cautious of social networks that do not provide “take down” policies, which allow users 
to remove embarrassing materials from their pages.

n this chapter, we discuss social networks, auctions, and portals. What do 
social networks, auctions, and portals have in common? They are all based 
on feelings of shared interest and self-identification—in short, a sense of com-
munity. Social networks and online communities explicitly attract people with shared 
affinities, such as ethnicity, gender, religion, and political views, or shared interests, 
such as hobbies, sports, and vacations. The auction site eBay started as a community 
of people interested in trading unwanted but functional items for which there was 
no ready commercial market. That community turned out to be huge—much larger 
than anyone expected. Portals also contain strong elements of community by provid-
ing access to community-fostering technologies such as e-mail, chat groups, bulletin 
boards, and discussion forums.
	11.1	 SOCIAL NETWORKS AND ONLINE COMMUNITIES
The Internet was designed originally as a communications medium to connect sci-
entists in computer science departments around the continental United States. From 
the beginning, the Internet was intended, in part, as a community-building technol-
ogy that would allow scientists to share data, knowledge, and opinions in a real-time 
online environment (see Chapter 3) (Hiltzik, 1999). The result of this early Internet 
was the first “virtual communities” (Rheingold, 1993). As the Internet grew in the late 
1980s to include scientists from many disciplines and university campuses, thousands 
of virtual communities sprang up among small groups of scientists in very different 
disciplines that communicated regularly using Internet e-mail, listservs, and bulletin 
boards. The first articles and books on the new electronic communities began appearing 
in the mid- to late 1980s (Kiesler et al., 1984; Kiesler, 1986). One of the earliest online 
communities, The Well (originally Whole Earth ‘Lectronic Link), was formed in San 
Francisco in 1985 by a small group of people who once shared an 1,800-acre commune 
in Tennessee. The Well continues to have thousands of members devoted to discus-
sion, debate, advice, and help (Hafner, 1997; Rheingold, 1998). With the development 
of the Web in the early 1990s, millions of people began obtaining Internet accounts 
and e-mail, and the community-building impact of the Internet strengthened. By the 
late 1990s, the commercial value of online communities was recognized as a potential 
new business model (Hagel and Armstrong, 1997).
The early online communities involved a relatively small number of web aficiona-
dos, and users with intense interests in technology, politics, literature, and ideas. The 
technology was largely limited to posting text messages on bulletin boards sponsored by 
the community, and one-to-one or one-to-many e-mails. In addition to The Well, early 
networks included GeoCities, a website hosting service based on neighborhoods. By 2002, 
however, the nature of online communities had begun to change. User-created websites 
called blogs became inexpensive and easy to set up without any technical expertise. Photo 
sites enabled convenient sharing of photos. Beginning in 2007, the growth of mobile 
devices like smartphones, tablet computers, digital cameras, and portable media devices

C H A P T E R  1 1     S o c i a l  N e t w o r k s ,  A u c t i o n s ,  a n d  P o r t a l s 
enabled sharing of rich media such as photos, music, and videos. Suddenly there was 
a much wider audience for sharing interests and activities, and much more to share. 
A new culture emerged as well. The broad democratization of the technology and 
its spread to the larger population meant that online social networks were no longer 
limited to a small group but instead broadened to include a much wider set of people 
and tastes, especially pre-teens, teens, and college students who were the fastest to 
adopt many of these new technologies. Entire families and friendship networks soon 
joined. The new social network culture is very personal and “me” centered, displaying 
photos and broadcasting personal activities, interests, hobbies, and relationships on 
social network profiles. In an online social network, the “news” is not something that 
happened somewhere else to other people; instead, the news is what happened to you 
today, and what’s going on with your friends and colleagues. Today’s social networks 
are as much a sociological phenomenon as they are a technology phenomenon. 
Currently, social network participation is one of the most common usages of 
the Internet. Over three-quarters of all Internet users and about 70% of the total U.S. 
population—about 186 million Americans—use social networks (eMarketer, Inc., 
2016a). Facebook has over 1.7 billion active users (with about 167 million in North 
America) and a little over 1.5 billion mobile monthly users (Facebook, 2016). There is 
obviously an overlap between these two sets of users. In the United States, Facebook 
typically has around 144 mobile users (again, with many of these being overlapping) 
(eMarketer, Inc., 2016b). Other large social networks include LinkedIn (profiled in the 
opening case), Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat, and Tumblr. While Facebook 
is the most popular social network in the United States, it is also the slowest growing, 
up just a few percentage points since 2012. Facebook appears to have hit a plateau in 
the United States, and its real hope for growth is offshore, where it is pushing to create 
basic Internet access so more people will join the network. Newer social networks, 
such as Pinterest, Instagram, and Snapchat, are growing much more quickly.
Worldwide, the social network phenomena is even stronger with over 2.3 billion 
users worldwide, 32% of the world’s population, and still growing at 9% annually. Social 
networks are a top online destination in every country, accounting for the majority of 
time spent online, and reaching almost 79% of active Internet users. Asia-Pacific has 
the largest social network audience, followed by the Middle East and Africa, and Latin 
America, while North America has the highest penetration of social network usage among 
the general population (eMarketer, Inc., 2016c). Although Facebook dominates the global 
social network marketspace, in some countries, localized social networks are signficant, 
such as Orkut (owned by Google) in Brazil, Mixi and social messaging app Line in Japan, 
Qzone, QQ, Sina Weibo, and RenRen in China, XING in Germany, Tuenti in Spain, and 
VK in Russia. There is an online social network for you to join almost anywhere you go! 
WHAT IS AN ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORK?
So exactly how do we define an online social network, and how is it any different from, 
say, an offline social network? Sociologists, who frequently criticize modern society 
for having destroyed traditional communities, unfortunately have not given us very 
good definitions of social networks and community. One study examined 94 different 
sociological definitions of community and found four areas of agreement. Social net-
works involve (a) a group of people, (b) shared social interaction, (c) common ties

among members, and (d) people who share an area for some period of time (Hillery, 
1955). This will be our working definition of a social network. Social networks do not 
necessarily have shared goals, purposes, or intentions. Indeed, social networks can 
be places where people just “hang out,” share space, and communicate.
It’s a short step to defining an online social network as an online location where 
people who share common ties can interact with one another. This definition is very 
close to that of Howard Rheingold’s—one of The Well’s early participants—who coined 
the term virtual communities as “cultural aggregations that emerge when enough people 
bump into each other often enough in cyberspace.” It is a group of people who may 
or may not meet one another face to face, and who exchange words and ideas through 
the mediation of an online social meeting space. The Internet removes the geographic 
and time limitations of offline social networks. To be in an online network, you don’t 
need to meet face to face, in a common room, at a common time. 
THE GROWTH OF SOCIAL NETWORKS AND ONLINE COMMUNITIES
Figure 11.1 shows the top social networks, which together account for well over 90% 
of the Internet’s social network activity. 
The largest group of Facebook users in the United States are 25 to 34 years old 
(36 million), followed by 35- to 45-year-olds (30 million). Over one-third (35%) of U.S. 
Facebook users are older than 44. Adults over 65 constitute the fastest growing group 
on Facebook (eMarketer, Inc., 2016d). In contrast, Twitter is far more popular among 
young adults under 34. Similar patterns are observed worldwide as older populations 
use social networks to stay in touch with children and relatives. Facebook is the most 
popular social network among teens, with Instagram and Snapchat not far behind.

Newer social networks tend to follow this same pattern, with young people being the 
first adopters. 
While Facebook and Twitter still tend to dominate the news, a new kind of social 
network is appearing and growing much faster than Facebook with respect to unique 
visitors and subscribers. These new social networks are attracting marketers and 
advertisers as well. For instance, Pinterest, described in the closing case in Chapter 
1, is a visually oriented site that allows users to curate their tastes and preferences, 
expressed in visual arts. You can think of Pinterest as a visual blog. Users post images 
to an online “pinboard.” The images can come from any source. Users can also “re-pin” 
images they see on Pinterest. Pinterest’s membership has skyrocketed since its launch, 
accumulating 150 million active members worldwide as of October 2016. Instagram 
is another social network that focuses on video and photo sharing. A mobile app that 
enables a user to easily share images to social networks, Instagram was acquired by 
Facebook for $1 billion in 2012 and has over 500 million members in September 2016. 
Other social networks are not necessarily competing with Facebook, but adding 
to the social network mix and enlarging the total social network audience. Table 11.1 
describes some other popular social networks. 
Contributing to the continued growth and commercial success of networks is 
the rapid adoption and intense use of mobile devices. Over 90% of Facebook’s users 
worldwide are mobile users, although not exclusively. According to comScore, Face-
book’s flagship Facebook app has the highest number of unique visitors (150 million) 
of all mobile apps and appears on the home screen of 46% of all smartphone users, 
with the average person spending 13 hours on the app a month (comScore, 2016b). 
Several of the largest newer social networks like Instagram and Snapchat are almost 
entirely mobile. 
A new crop of social networks launched since 2008 focuses on messaging. 
Snapchat (2009) lets users send photos and videos to friends that self-extinguish in 
ten seconds. Snapchat Stories have a longer lifespan: 24 hours. Snapchat has very 
high reach among its core audience of 18- to 24-year-olds, but in 2016, it also began 
to break into the mainstream, with significant growth in the over-25 age group 
demographic (comScore, 2016b). WhatsApp (2009; acquired by Facebook in 2014) 
is a messaging service that lets users send text, photos, and videos to their friends’ 
cellphones using the Internet and without having to pay telecommunications com-
panies for cellphone SMS messaging services. Six of the world’s most-used apps are 
messaging services. 
The number of unique visitors is just one way to measure the influence of a site. 
Time on site is another important metric. The more time people spend on a site, 
called engagement, the more time to display ads and generate revenue. In this sense, 
Facebook is much more addictive and immersive than the other top social networks. 
Over time, Facebook has tweaked its content and algorithms in order to keep users 
on the site longer. In 2014, Facebook added videos (both ads and user-contributed), 
and in 2016 is now displaying around 8 billion videos a day. It tries to show videos 
that reflect the user’s interests and friends and also plays them automatically in the 
News Feed, forcing users to turn them off but also ensuring that they are seen for at

least a few moments. Facebook has also made changes to its News Feed algorithm to 
capture more user attention: increasing content from users’ favorite friends; decreas-
ing content from friends of users’ friends; and showing multiple posts in a row from 
the same source for users with few friends (Gaudin, 2015). Table 11.2 illustrates the 
different levels of engagement with the top social networks. 
The amount of revenue generated is the ultimate metric for measuring a com-
pany’s business potential. The top three search engine companies (Google, Yahoo, 
and Microsoft) are expected to generate about $30 billion in U.S. search and display 
advertising revenue in 2016 (eMarketer, Inc., 2016e). In contrast, social networks in

the United States in 2016 are expected to generate about $15.4 billion in advertising 
revenue. Social networks are the fastest growing form of Internet usage and advertis-
ing revenue, but they are not yet as lucrative as traditional search engines/portals in 
terms of ad dollars generated. A part of the problem is that subscribers do not go to 
social networks to seek ads for relevant products, nor pay attention to the ads that are 
flashed before their eyes (see Chapters 6 and 7). In addition, the small screen of the 
smartphone, the dominant social network platform, is not ideal for display advertis-
ing of retail goods. Here, tablets and desktop PCs are more suitable for browsing and 
purchasing.
TURNING SOCIAL NETWORKS INTO BUSINESSES
While the early social networks had a difficult time raising capital and revenues, today’s 
top social networks are now monetizing their huge audiences. Early social networks 
relied on subscriptions, but today, most social networks rely on advertising or the 
investments of venture capitalists. Users of portals and search engines have come to 
accept advertising as the preferred means of supporting web experiences rather than 
paying for it. One important exception is LinkedIn, which offers basic free memberships 
for individuals but charges for premium services. Figure 11.2 shows the comparative 
amount of ad spending on various social networks. Facebook, with almost $12 billion 
in ad revenue, towers over the other sites.
Social networks do not always succeed as businesses. For instance, Twitter began 
as a social messaging service on which users could communicate with followers. It 
quickly turned into an Internet broadcasting network for millions of on-scene observers 
acting as citizen reporters, as well as political organizers, celebrities, and politicians. In 
2016, it has just over 300 million users. Twitter’s growth has stagnated, and in 2015, it 
lost $521 million, disappointing investors who expect more advertising dollars and real 
revenue. Twitter has never shown a profit. In 2015, co-founder Jack Dorsey returned 
in October 2015 in an effort to reinvigorate Twitter’s user and revenue growth. But 
despite a number of incremental changes designed to streamline the service and 
make it easier to use, as well as several new strategic efforts, such as live-streaming 
video partnerships with the sports leagues like the NFL, Twitter’s share of U.S. social 
networks has continued to drop. In September 2016, Twitter is reportedly up for sale. 
See the Chapter 2 opening case on Twitter for a more detailed discussion of Twitter’s 
business model. 
The rapid adoption of mobile devices initially posed a challenge to social networks 
like Facebook, as well as Google’s search engine, because they were largely based on 
the desktop platform. Google dominated mobile ad revenues up until 2013 because 
its search engine and Google Maps were among the most popular apps. Facebook 
quickly developed its own mobile app, and purchased others, and within the space of 
four years has been able to capture a significant part of the mobile ad market, using 
its mobile News Feed to provide users a continual stream of ads. The top seven apps, 
and eight of the top nine, are owned by either Google or Facebook. For Facebook, that 
includes the main Facebook app (1st), Facebook Messenger (2nd), and Instagram (9th). 
Today, around 85% of Facebook’s revenue (around $10.1 billion) comes from mobile

advertising. Other social network apps within the top 25 are Snapchat (13th), Pinterest 
(14th), and Twitter (17th) (comScore, 2016b). 
Social networks have had an important impact on how businesses operate, com-
municate, and serve their customers. A 2015 survey of Fortune 500 firms found that 93% 
used LinkedIn, 78% used Twitter, and 74% used Facebook (Barnes et al., 2015). The most 
visible business firm use of social networks is as a marketing and branding tool. A less 
visible marketing use of networks is as a powerful listening tool that has strengthened 
the role of customers and customer feedback systems inside a business. Public social 
networks like Facebook have not been used extensively in firms as collaboration tools thus 
far. However, in 2015, Facebook launched its Facebook at Work app, designed to spur col-
laboration and networking inside large firms, as a pilot project. In October 2016, it finally 
released the commercial version of the app, now called Workplace. The new app faces 
stiff competition from a wide array of collaboration tools provided by Cisco, Microsoft, 
IBM, and along with other technologies like instant messaging and teleconferencing.
Social networks are where corporate brands and reputations are formed, and firms 
today take very seriously the topic of “online reputation,” as evidenced by social network 
posts, commentary, chat sessions, and Likes. In this sense, social networks become an 
extension of corporate customer relationship management systems and extend existing 
market research programs. Beyond branding, social networks are being used increas-
ingly as advertising platforms to contact a younger audience than websites and e-mail, 
and as customers increasingly shift their eyeballs to social networks. Rosetta Stone, for 
instance, uses its Facebook page to display videos of its learning technology, encour-
age discussions and reviews, and post changes in its learning tools. Yet the business

use of social networks does not always go well. The Insight on Society case, The Dark 
Side of Social Networks, discusses some of the risks associated with social networks.
TYPES OF SOCIAL NETWORKS AND THEIR BUSINESS MODELS
There are many types and many ways of classifying social networks and online com-
munities. While the most popular general social networks have adopted an advertising 
model, other kinds of networks have different revenue sources. Social networks have 
different types of sponsors and different kinds of members. For instance, some are 
created by firms such as IBM for the exclusive use of their sales force or other employ-
ees (intra-firm communities or B2E [business-to-employee] communities); others are 
built for suppliers and resellers (inter-organizational or B2B communities); and others 
are built by dedicated individuals for other similar persons with shared interests (P2P 
[people-to-people] communities). In this chapter, we will discuss B2C communities for 
the most part, although we also discuss briefly P2P communities of practice.
Table 11.3 describes in greater detail the five generic types of social networks and 
online communities: general, practice, interest, affinity, and sponsored. Each type of 
community can have a commercial intent or commercial consequence. We use this 
schema to explore the business models of commercial communities.
General communities offer members opportunities to interact with a general 
audience organized into general topics. Within the topics, members can find hundreds 
of specific discussion groups attended by thousands of like-minded members who 
share an interest in that topic. The purpose of the general community is to attract 
enough members to populate a wide range of topics and discussion groups. The busi-
general communities 
offer members opportunities 
to interact with a general 
audience organized into 
general topics

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
THE DARK SIDE OF SOCIAL NETWORKS 
In 2015, theme park chain SeaWorld 
thought it had a great marketing idea 
when it launched a Twitter hashtag 
campaign to improve its public image. 
Using the hashtag #AskSeaWorld, the 
company solicited questions from Twitter 
users in an attempt to be more transparent about 
its operations. SeaWorld is a frequent target for 
animal rights activists, who object to the company’s 
treatment of sea animals, and was the subject of the 
2013 documentary Blackfish, which told the story 
of a whale whose mistreatment and resulting erratic 
behavior led to the deaths of three people. After the 
documentary, SeaWorld’s ticket sales plunged and 
its already spotty public image was devastated. The 
company hoped that the hashtag campaign would 
be a much needed step in its rehabilitation.
That’s not exactly how the campaign turned 
out. First, People for the Ethical Treatment of Ani-
mals (PETA) used the hashtag to attack SeaWorld 
for its poor animal care. SeaWorld failed to respond. 
Soon, many more activists and regular people 
jumped on the bandwagon, relentlessly attacking 
SeaWorld and its animal handling techniques. Some 
users asked why the parking lots at SeaWorld are 
bigger than the whale tanks, for example.
Instead of demonstrating its awareness of the 
improvement it needs to make in these areas, Sea-
World finally answered these and other concerns by 
stating, “No time for bots and bullies. We want to 
answer your questions,” completely dismissing its 
skeptics. The company posted several more tweets 
with crying babies and memes of Internet trolls to 
represent the animal rights activists. Needless to 
say, this only made things worse for SeaWorld. In 
2016, well over a year later, angry animal lovers 
continue to use the hashtag to attack SeaWorld’s 
treatment of whales, dolphins, and other marine 
animals. SeaWorld’s stock price hit an all-time low 
in August 2016. By any measure, SeaWorld pre-
sented us with a textbook case in how social network 
advertising and branding can go horribly wrong.
 Attempts at humor can also often go horribly 
awry, as Budweiser discovered in advertising for 
its Bud Light brand.The company introduced the 
hashtag #upforwhatever in 2015, supported by TV 
ads and advertising on other platforms. One of the 
47 slogans that accompanied the hashtag on its 
beer bottles was “The perfect beer for removing ‘no’ 
from your vocabulary for the night.” Many of Bud 
Light’s followers were shocked that the company 
would make such a controversial statement. The 
company claimed that its slogans were intended 
to inspire spontaneous fun, but admitted that this 
particular slogan was a misfire and immediately 
apologized and discontinued its use.
Soft drink giant Coca-Cola also encountered 
the dark side of social networks after its 2016 
campaign to wish its customers in different coun-
tries Happy New Year. First, the company sent a 
message on VK, the most popular Russian social 
network, consisting of a map of Russia decorated 
with holiday ornaments. There was nothing offensive 
about the decorations, but Coca-Cola omitted the 
disputed territory of Crimea. Russian followers of 
Coca-Cola were enraged. In response, Coca-Cola 
adjusted the map, adding the Crimea as well as other 
territories it had neglected the first time around. 
This time, it was Ukraine’s turn to take offense. 
Ukraine and Russia have been battling over the 
area since 2014, and Ukrainians believe the terri-
tory has been unlawfully annexed by Russia. Many 
Ukrainians vowed to boycott Coca-Cola, with some 
tweeting pictures of themselves pouring Coke down 
the toilet in disgust. Coca-Cola eventually deleted 
the second image without replacing the first image. 
The SeaWorld, Bud Light, and Coca-Cola fias-
cos are instructive. SeaWorld was totally unpre-
pared for a hashtag campaign gone wrong. Bud 
Light didn’t consider how its messaging might be

interpreted as offensive by many customers. 
Coca-Cola failed to fully recognize the unique 
aspects of each geopolitical region in which 
it operates. Companies need to be prepared to 
handle negative comments appropriately and take 
responsibility for mistakes.
Companies don’t appear to be learning from 
the earlier mistakes of their peers. For example, 
in 2014, homemade pizza maker DiGiorno’s blun-
dered when it used a hashtag meant to bring 
awareness to domestic violence, #WhyIStayed, 
in a tweet promoting its pizza. Outrage came 
swiftly and DiGiorno’s took the tweet down amid 
a storm of criticism. The New England Patriots 
football team ran a campaign that automatically 
retweeted users’ Twitter account names super-
imposed on team jerseys when users tweeted 
the #1MillionPatriots hashtag. Users seized the 
opportunity to wreak havoc, creating offensive 
Twitter handles that embarrassed the Patriots. 
And US Airways inadvertently tweeted a graphic 
pornographic image in response to a customer 
service complaint. Perhaps most surprisingly of all, 
Twitter’s own chief financial officer accidentally 
publicly tweeted a message about an acquisition 
the company was still considering.
But in 2014, KFC set a good example when 
the news broke that a 3-year-old girl from Missis-
sippi who had been mauled by her grandfather’s 
dogs had subsequently been asked to leave a local 
KFC because she reportedly was scaring the other 
patrons. The visit to the restaurant had been a 
special treat for the girl from her family after a 
doctor’s visit. When the news hit social media, KFC 
was caught in a firestorm of enraged customers. The 
company took the next several days to respond to 
as many individual comments as it could, posted a 
personal apology to the girl’s Facebook page, and 
pledged $30,000 toward her medical bills. 
Marketing is not the only social media hazard. 
For employees, privacy protection for Facebook 
posts is still being determined in the courts. For 
example, Danielle Mailhoit was the manager of a 
Home Depot store in Burbank, California. After 
she was fired, she filed suit claiming gender and 
disability discrimination due to her vertigo. The 
defense attorney filed a broad request for all of 
Mailhoit’s social media activity. In September 
2012, a federal judge ruled this request overly 
broad and limited discovery to only communica-
tions between the plaintiff and current or former 
Home Depot employees. Stating that they were 
unlikely to be relevant unless they were directly 
related to the lawsuit or her former employment, 
she also denied Home Depot’s request for photos.
Employers must be careful with personal infor-
mation gleaned from social networks. If it can be 
proven that membership in a protected group was 
discovered during the hiring process and used to 
reject a candidate or later used to terminate an 
employee, a claim can be filed under one of the 
Federal Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) 
laws. These include Title VII of the Civil Rights Act 
of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment 
Act of 1967 (ADEA), Title I and Title V of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and 
Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimina-
tion Act of 2008 (GINA), which prohibits employ-
ment discrimination based on genetic information 
about an applicant, employee, or former employee. 
GINA’s regulations provide a distinction between 
whether genetic information is acquired purposefully 
or inadvertently. Inadvertent acquisition includes 
acquisition through social networks, equating it to 
accidentally overhearing a conversation at work.
However, data on a social media site protected 
by privacy controls should not be able to be “inad-
vertently” acquired. The Stored Communications 
Act (SCA) covers privacy protection for e-mail and 
digital communications. The latest court rulings on 
its application to social network communications 
have held that Facebook wall postings and other 
social media comments are protected as long as 
they have not been made public.
Facebook, to protect its business model, is 
speaking out against recent hiring practices that 
have come to its attention—and threatening legal 
action. According to both Facebook and the Ameri-

ness model of general communities is typically advertising supported by selling ad space on 
pages and videos. 
Practice networks offer members focused discussion groups, help, information, and 
knowledge relating to an area of shared practice. For instance, Linux.org is a nonprofit com-
munity for the open source movement, a worldwide global effort involving thousands of pro-
grammers who develop computer code for the Linux operating system and share the results 
freely with all. Other online communities involve artists, educators, art dealers, photographers, 
and nurses. Practice networks can be either profit-based or nonprofit, and support themselves 
by advertising or user donations. 
Interest-based social networks offer members focused discussion groups based on a 
shared interest in some specific subject, such as business careers, boats, horses, health, skiing, 
and thousands of other topics. Because the audience for interest communities is necessarily 
much smaller and more targeted, these communities have usually relied on advertising and 
practice networks

can Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), some compa-
nies have been asking new hires either to friend 
the hiring manager or to submit their password. 
Facebook’s Privacy Page condemns this practice, 
stating that it violates both individual users’ and 
their friends’ expectations of privacy, jeopardizes 
security, and could reveal a user’s membership in a 
protected group. The legal implications of interac-
tions on social media are still being determined; 
for example, in 2016, a judge ruled that “tagging” 
someone in a photo represents the violation of a 
protective order limiting communication.
Legislators in a growing number of states have 
decided to be proactive. In 2012, California banned 
employers from asking prospective employees for 
their social media user names and passwords. In 
2016, Illinois became the 25th state to enact 
a law that prevents employers from accessing 
potential employees’ social media accounts, with 
Massachusetts and Ohio poised to add to that 
number in 2017. Additionally, 15 states 
have enacted laws that forbid educational 
institutions from doing so for their prospective 
students. At the federal level, the House passed a 
bill in 2016 that requires the President to submit 
a strategy to address the use of social media by 
terrorist groups.
Carefully crafted policies can help compa-
nies to avoid the dark side of social networking. 
Advertising and hiring are but two of the areas 
that must be monitored. Companies must also 
develop policies regarding employee use of social 
networks. Employee education programs must 
be implemented to apprise employees of infrac-
tions that can be grounds for disciplinary action. 
IT departments must develop stringent policies 
to protect proprietary data and defend company 
networks from cyberscams. Social networking 
is an exciting new tool, but one that requires 
safeguards.

tenancy/sponsorship deals. Social networks such as Fool.com, Military.com, Sailing 
Anarchy, and Chronicle Forums all are examples of social networks that attract people 
who share a common pursuit. Job markets and forums such as LinkedIn can be con-
sidered interest-based social networks as well.
Affinity communities offer members focused discussions and interaction with 
other people who share the same affinity. “Affinity” refers to self- and group identifica-
tion. For instance, people can self-identify themselves on the basis of religion, ethnicity, 
gender, sexual orientation, political beliefs, geographical location, and hundreds of other 
categories. For instance, Bloom is a network for pregnant women and moms that enables 
them to give and seek advice, discuss concerns and share stories, as well as find local 
services, and buy and sell related products (Bloomapp.co, 2016). These social networks 
are supported by advertising along with revenues from sales of products.
Sponsored communities are online communities created by government, non-
profit, or for-profit organizations for the purpose of pursuing organizational goals. 
These goals can be diverse, from increasing the information available to citizens; for 
instance, a local county government site such as Westchestergov.com, the website for 
Westchester County (New York) government; to an online auction site such as eBay; 
to a product site such as Tide.com, which is sponsored by an offline branded product 
company (Procter & Gamble). Cisco, IBM, HP, and hundreds of other companies have 
developed their internal corporate social networks as a way of sharing knowledge. 
SOCIAL NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES AND FEATURES
Algorithms are one of the most important technologies used by social networks. Algo-
rithms are a set of step-by-step instructions, similar to a recipe, for producing a desired 
output from required inputs. Computer algorithms are computer programs that carry 
out step-by-step instructions to produce desired outputs (Coremen, et. al., 2009). 
Algorithms are an ancient concept, but are fundamental to how computers are used 
today to do everything from calculating pay checks, the amount you owe when pur-
chasing online, selecting movies on Netflix that you are likely to watch, or recom-
mending products you may be interested in based on your prior purchases. How, for 
instance, does Facebook decide what trending news to list in your Trending section, 
which of your posts to post on your friends’ News Feeds, and which Instant Articles 
to make available on your mobile News Feed? 
The problem Facebook and other social sites need to solve is how to select content 
(actions of their friends and news stories) for display on users’ pages that they will 
find interesting, and likely click on. Also, Facebook needs to prevent information that 
is irrelevant from appearing on user pages. Figure 11.3 illustrates the generic algo-
rithm Facebook uses to produce what it calls relationship-based content personalized 
for members of a social network based on a patent it filed in 2010. It shows the generic 
eight steps in the algorithm (left column), and a translation of each step (right column). 
Facebook users organize themselves into affinity groups by selecting and accepting 
one another as friends. Affinity groups are a key concept here and in all social net-
works: they are generally composed of like-minded people who share views, attitudes, 
purchase patterns, and tastes in music and videos. Facebook attempts to discover 
exactly what those views, attitudes, purchase patterns, and tastes in music and videos

FACEBOOK’S ALGORITHM FOR GENERATING 
PERSONALIZED STORIES
Facebook uses a very complex algorithm to identify content that users are likely to click on. Each step in the 
algorithm is implanted by computer programs involving tens of thousands of lines of computer code and 
thousands of hours of software engineering and system development.

are, as well as demographic and other personal information. Once these are identified, 
Facebook attempts to find out what content is being consumed by each affinity group 
and matches the content to each group (relation-base content). Facebook creates a 
database of this relationship-based content, and serves it to other members of the 
group, as well as other affinity groups that share similar features.

In the end, you will be informed of what your friends are doing, liking, viewing 
and listening to. You will find this interesting and engaging. You will be spared hearing 
about other affinity groups who are very dissimilar to your affinity groups. New content 
(news, music, videos) that is similar to what your affinity group has liked in the past 
will also be served to you. For instance, if you are a staunch conservative or liberal, 
and you choose to click on articles that confirm your views, other members of your 
affinity group who share your views will have the content and your behavior displayed 
on their pages. They in turn may share this content with other Facebook friends, and 
other affinity groups of which they are a part. 
While the generic algorithm appears simple, each step in the algorithm is imple-
mented by computer programs involving tens of thousands of lines of computer code, 
and thousands of hours of software engineering and system development. The data 
produced by over 167 million users in the United States, and 1.7 billion other users 
worldwide requires three data centers in the United States and one in Sweden, a total 
of a million square feet containing tens of thousands of servers, all connected by 
several fiber optic networks (Data Center Knowledge, 2016). According to Facebook, 
loading a user’s home page involves hundreds of servers, processing tens of thousands 
of individual pieces of data, and delivering the information selected in less than one 
second. The Insight on Technology case, Trapped Inside the Facebook Bubble?, examines 
the impact of algorithms in further depth. 
Social networks also have developed a number of other software applications that 
allow users to engage in a number of activities. Table 11.4 describes several additional 
social network functionalities.

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
TRAPPED INSIDE THE FACEBOOK BUBBLE? 
In May 2016, the blog Gizmodo pub-
lished a report claiming that Face-
book suppressed conservative political 
stories in its Trending section by allow-
ing its news curators to intervene in the 
operation of Facebook’s Trending algorithm, 
which allegedly chose trending topics based organi-
cally on Facebook’s users’ likes, mentions, posts, 
and clicks. There was, so the article claimed, a lib-
eral bias at Facebook. The article, based on claims 
of former employees, led to a flurry of critical news 
articles, a potential Congressional investigation, a 
public debate over Facebook’s role in promoting 
its own political agenda, and a great deal of com-
mentary about the role of Facebook in shaping the 
news that Americans read everyday. 
A related debate arose concerning the role 
of Facebook’s entire News Feed algorithm, which 
displays posts by your Facebook friends, as well as 
ads based in part on Facebook’s knowledge of you 
and your friends. Critics fear that both the News 
Feed and Trending section are helping to create a 
highly polarized society: users see only the social 
and political views of their friends on controversial 
topics, creating a self-reinforcing, bubble world. 
Sometimes referred to as the Facebook filter trap, 
echo chamber, or bubble, critics believe this results 
in groups who never share news or interact with one 
another, and who therefore cannot find a middle 
ground to share. Worse, extremist groups prolif-
erate based on their own unchallenged facts and 
theories, which are never subjected to accuracy 
checking. It’s called homophily: given a choice, 
people tend to associate with people like them-
selves. In the social network world, this translates 
to only being exposed to views of people who share 
your views, creating an echo chamber. Contrary 
views will rarely make it to your News Feed or 
your Trending feed. Every click, every Like, and 
keystroke creates a reality for users that may or 
may not be a fiction. 
From Facebook’s point of view, both the News 
Feed and Trending algorithms solve an important 
problem for today’s users of social networks: there is 
so much information online that users may become 
inundated with information that does not interest 
them, and makes it difficult for them to find informa-
tion that does interest them. The resulting frustration 
could turn users away from social networks that 
increasingly are the source of news and opinion 
for web users. Therefore there is a need for what 
Facebook refers to, in its patent applications for 
both algorithms, as “a system to generate dynamic, 
relationship-based content personalized for members 
of a Social Network.” Translated, this means the 
algorithms are set up to engage you and keep you 
on the site, exposing you to more ads. 
The Trending algorithm is a complex chunk 
of code that operates in real time. The algorithm 
monitors the behavior of over 200 million users 
in the United States and over 1 billion worldwide, 
and posts the results on the top right of users’ 
News Feed pages, changing periodically through 
the day. The algorithm is also sensitive to rates 
of change: if mentions spike in a short period of 
time, the topic gets boosted in ranking. Facebook 
certainly gave users the impression that Trending 
was a computer-driven process that accurately and 
objectively reflects what other users were reacting 
to on the social network and what you are likely 
to click on. 
But the reality was really quite different, 
according to Gizmodo and former employees. The 
process of selecting trends evolved over several 
years, but from the beginning news curators (jour-
nalists) intervened and had the last say about what 
was, or was not, included in Trending. As it turns 
out, the algorithm could not distinguish between a 

734	
	
C H A P T E R  1 1     S o c i a l  N e t w o r k s ,  A u c t i o n s ,  a n d  P o r t a l s 
real event (a SpaceX rocket exploded on the 
pad) versus a phony event (spacemen land in 
New Mexico), or if a topic was covered elsewhere 
as a live topic on Facebook. The algorithm was not 
allowed to include stories about Facebook itself. 
If the algorithm missed important news events 
for some reason, curators injected these events 
and views as Trending topics. Often, with complex 
algorithms, how they produce results is not precisely 
understood even by their authors, and the results 
of the algorithm may not quite hit the mark. Hot 
topics identified by the algorithm that involved 
sex, pornography, nudity, graphic violence, or “R” 
rated content were removed by editors. Humans 
played an important editorial role in creating the 
Trending topics, and like journalists and editors 
everywhere, could exercise their discretion and 
perhaps insert their political views, in the process. 
In many ways, this sounds just like an ordinary 
newspaper or television news program: selecting 
news that editors think will be of interest to its 
readership, using headlines, lists, and sidebars to 
other stories.
An examination of Facebook’s patent describ-
ing the Trending algorithm reveals that a variety 
of other factors are used to create the Trending 
list. The algorithm uses keywords to process men-
tions and other activities of users (such as Super 
Bowl, skiing, baseball, etc.) and groups them into 
topics. Each topic is given a trending score based 
on the geographic location of users posting about 
the topic, the number of mentions, and the rate of 
increase in activity. Then the trending topics are 
matched to the personal interests of your friends on 
the social network, and of each user, as well as other 
factors like gender, race, national origin, religion, 
age, marital status, disability, sexual orientation, 
educational level, and socioeconomic statuses. In 
short, just about everything you have ever shared 
with Facebook! 
The net result is that the Trending topics you 
see are likely different from those displayed to your 
next-door neighbor, friends who live in a different 
state, colleagues at work, or millions of others who 
see their own personalized topics. The Trending 
topics do not reflect the Facebook user audience, 
but instead are Facebook’s best estimate of what 
you would find engaging, what your friends have 
found engaging, and what you are more likely to 
click on, thereby keeping you on Facebook for the 
display of ads. Facebook is in the business of manu-
facturing advertising revenues through increasing 
engagement, i.e., time on site. Facebook is not a 
news organization in the traditional sense, but a 
redistributor of content created by others, whether 
professional journalists or amateur bloggers. 
One of the vulnerabilities of the Trending algo-
rithm is its sensitivity to the number of mentions 
(which could be Likes, posts, clicks, or other behav-
ior), and the rate of increase over short periods 
of time. Social scientists established a long time 
ago that on most controversial issues, 90% of the 
population appears near the middle of opinion, or 
close by. The other 10% of the population has views 
that are significantly further away from the aver-
age opinion. Sometimes called “fringe groups” or 
“extremists,” people in these groups often are highly 
engaged, very active contributors to Facebook 
and other opinion sites, often espouse conspiracy 
theories, engage in hate speech, and do so in a 
concerted short-term burst of online posting in the 
hope of influencing a very large online audience by 
encouraging a viral sharing of their posts. Fringe 
groups try to take advantage of the viral nature 
of social networks. Facebook’s algorithm tries to 
counter this tendency by demoting content posted 
by very frequent contributors. 
In response to the public concern about liberal 
bias in the Trending section, and the difficulty Face-
book encountered in trying to clearly explain how its 
Trending section works, Facebook fired its staff of 
26 Trending editors in 2016, and promised to rely 
only on the Trending algorithm in order to eliminate 
human bias and be more objective. The early results 
suggest that more false news stories, conspiracy 
theories, and offensive material are appearing in

Trending than before. As one pundit noted, with 
its human editors dismissed, Facebook has let the 
inmates—Facebook users—run the asylum. 
The News Feed also faces similar criticism. To 
illustrate the strength of the News Feed echo cham-
ber, and how reality differs for different Facebook 
users, the Wall Street Journal publishes a graphi-
cal representation of how very liberal and very 
conservative users of Facebook linked to (reacted 
to) news articles drawn from over 500 sources, 
from bloggers to reputable news organizations. 
The data was originally produced in a large study 
of user behavior funded by Facebook, conducted by 
Facebook researchers, and reported in the magazine 
Science. The News Feeds of 10 million users were 
examined. The results of the Journal’s online data 
is that very liberal and very conservative Facebook 
users create for themselves, through their selec-
tion of news articles enabled by the News Feed 
algorithm, two highly divergent world views on 
most topics, from guns, to abortion, ISIS, political 
candidates, and so forth. For instance, on guns, very 
liberal users linked to news posts critical of the 
National Rifle Association, school shootings, and 
the ready availability of guns, among others. Very 
conservative users linked to news posts critical of 
gun control legislation, invasions of homes by armed 
criminals, and the use of guns for self-defense, 
among others. Facebook’s researchers concluded 
in the Science article that Facebook’s users do get 
some contrary views in their News Feeds and Trend-
ing sections, and that any bias is not caused 
by its algorithms, but rather by users selecting 
as friends people who share their views. The 
algorithms simply reflect what users have chosen 
in terms of friends and the articles they click on. 
If you want to know why liberals and conserva-
tives have a difficult time communicating with one 
another, let alone acting on key issues together, it’s 
because they reside in two very different, polarized 
news streams. Since well over half of the online 
population gets its news from social networks like 
Facebook, what Facebook determines is news has 
a significant impact on public debate and policy. 
On the other hand, is Facebook any different 
from a traditional newspaper or cable news channel, 
both of which select the news and views that they 
believe their readers and viewers find engaging? 
One difference is that for traditional news produc-
ers, human beings are doing the selection of news, 
and viewers understand this, and select among 
the offerings. At Facebook, algorithms, written 
by humans, automate this process of determining 
what is news. 
The algorithms of Trending cannot discern 
the validity of articles, the difference between a 
crackpot conspiracy theory, and a quality piece of 
well-researched journalism. Those who join any 
community on Facebook are algorithmically driven 
to receive more and more content supported by 
that group, and less content from opposing groups 
or views.

	11.2	 ONLINE AUCTIONS
Auctions are used throughout the e-commerce landscape. The most widely known 
auctions are consumer-to-consumer (C2C) auctions, in which the auction house 
is simply an intermediary market maker, providing a forum where consumers—buyers 
and sellers—can discover prices and trade. The market leader in C2C auctions is eBay, 
which, as of June 2016, had around 164 million active users in the United States and 
over 800 million items listed on any given day within thousands of different categories. 
In August 2016, eBay had around 110 million unique visitors, placing it 18th on the list 
of top 50 digital media (both desktop and mobile) properties (comScore, 2016a). In 
2015, eBay had about $6.1 billion in net revenues from its Marketplaces segment, a 
4% decline from 2014, and the total worth of goods sold or auctioned was around $78 
billion, a 2% decline from 2014 (eBay, 2016). eBay is further discussed in the case 
study at the end of this chapter. In the United States alone, there are several hundred 
auction sites, some specializing in unique collectible products such as stamps and 
coins, others adopting a more generalist approach in which almost any good can be 
found for sale.
Less well known are business-to-consumer (B2C) auctions, where a business 
owns or controls assets and uses dynamic pricing to establish the price. Increasingly, 
online retail sites, such as Sam’s Club, are adding auctions to their sites. Auctions also 
constitute a significant part of B2B e-commerce in 2016, and more than a third of 
procurement officers use auctions to procure goods. 
Some leading online auction sites are listed in Table 11.5. Auctions are not limited 
to goods and services. They can also be used to allocate resources, and bundles of 
resources, among any group of bidders. For instance, if you wanted to establish an 
optimal schedule for assigned tasks in an office among a group of clerical workers, an 
auction in which workers bid for assignments would come close to producing a nearly 
optimal solution in a short amount of time (Parkes and Ungar, 2000). In short, auc-
tions—like all markets—are ways of allocating resources among independent agents 
(bidders).
BENEFITS AND COSTS OF AUCTIONS
The Internet is primarily responsible for the resurgence in auctions. The Internet pro-
vides a global environment and very low fixed and operational costs for the aggregation 
of huge buyer audiences, composed of millions of consumers worldwide, who can use 
a universally available technology (Internet browsers) to shop for goods.
Benefits of Auctions
Aside from the sheer game-like fun of participating in auctions, consumers, merchants, 
and society as a whole derive a number of economic benefits from participating in 
Internet auctions. These benefits include:
•	 Liquidity: Sellers can find willing buyers, and buyers can find sellers. Sellers and 
buyers can be located anywhere around the globe. Just as important, buyers and

sellers can find a global market for rare items that would not have existed before 
the Internet.
•	 Price discovery: Buyers and sellers can quickly and efficiently develop prices for 
items that are difficult to assess, where the price depends on demand and supply, 
and where the product is rare. 
•	 Price transparency: Public Internet auctions allow everyone in the world to see 
the asking and bidding prices for items. 
•	 Market efficiency: Auctions can, and often do, lead to reduced prices, and hence 
reduced profits for merchants, leading to an increase in consumer welfare—one 
measure of market efficiency. 
•	 Lower transaction costs: Online auctions can lower the cost of selling and pur-
chasing products, benefiting both merchants and consumers. Like other Internet 
markets, such as retail markets, Internet auctions have very low (but not zero) 
transaction costs. 
•	 Consumer aggregation: Sellers benefit from large auction sites’ ability to aggre-
gate a large number of consumers who are motivated to purchase something in 
one marketspace.

for sale, the more valuable it becomes as a marketplace for everyone by providing 
liquidity and several other benefits listed previously, such as lower transaction 
costs, higher efficiency, and better price transparency. 
Risks and Costs of Auctions
There are a number of risks and costs involved in participating in auctions. In some cases, 
auction markets can fail—like all markets at times. (We describe auction market failure 
in more detail later.) Some of the more important risks and costs to keep in mind are:
•	 Delayed consumption costs: Internet auctions can go on for days, and shipping 
will take additional time. 
•	 Monitoring costs: Participation in auctions requires your time to monitor bidding.
•	 Equipment costs: Internet auctions require you to purchase a computer system 
and pay for Internet access.
•	 Trust risks: Online auctions are a significant source of Internet fraud. Using auc-
tions increases the risk of experiencing a loss.
•	 Fulfillment costs: Typically, the buyer pays fulfillment costs of packing, shipping, 
and insurance, whereas at a physical store these costs are included in the retail price.
Auction sites such as eBay have taken a number of steps to reduce consumer 
participation costs and trust risk. For instance, auction sites attempt to solve the trust 
problem by providing a rating system in which previous customers rate sellers based 
on their overall experience with the merchant. Although helpful, this solution does not 
always work. Auction fraud is a leading source of e-commerce complaints to federal law 
enforcement officials. Another partial solution to high monitoring costs is, ironically, fixed 
pricing. At eBay, consumers can reduce the cost of monitoring and waiting for auctions 
to end by simply clicking on the Buy It Now button and paying a premium price. The 
difference between the Buy It Now price and the auction price is the cost of monitoring. 
Nevertheless, given the costs of participating in online auctions, the generally 
lower cost of goods on Internet auctions is in part a compensation for the other addi-
tional costs consumers experience. On the other hand, consumers experience lower 
search costs and transaction costs because there usually are no intermediaries (unless, 
of course, the seller is an online business operating on an auction site, in which case 
there is a middleman cost), and usually there are no local or state taxes.
Merchants face considerable risks and costs as well. At auctions, merchants 
may end up selling goods for prices far below what they might have achieved in 
conventional markets. Merchants also face risks of nonpayment, false bidding, bid 
rigging, monitoring, transaction fees charged by the auction site, credit card trans-
action processing fees, and the administration costs of entering price and product 
information. 
AUCTIONS AS AN E-COMMERCE BUSINESS MODEL
Online auctions have been among the most successful business models in retail and B2B 
commerce. eBay, the Internet’s most lucrative auction site, has been profitable nearly 
since its inception. The strategy for eBay has been to make money off every stage in 

	
O n l i n e  A u c t i o n s 	

739
the auction cycle. eBay earns revenue from auctions in several ways: transaction fees 
based on the amount of the sale, listing fees for display of goods, financial service fees 
from payment systems such as PayPal, and advertising or placement fees where sellers 
pay extra for special services such as particular display or listing services. PayPal has 
been faster growing and more profitable than eBay’s markets, growing to more than 
half of eBay’s revenue. In 2015, eBay spun off PayPal into a separate company, and 
going forward will have to make its profits from its markets operation. 
However, it is on the cost side that online auctions have extraordinary advan-
tages over ordinary retail or catalog sites. Auction sites carry no inventory and do not 
perform any fulfillment activities—they need no warehouses, shipping, or logistical 
facilities. Sellers and consumers provide these services and bear these costs. In this 
sense, online auctions are an ideal digital business because they involve simply the 
transfer of information.
Even though eBay has been extraordinarily successful, the success of online 
auctions is qualified by the fact that the marketplace for online auctions is highly 
concentrated. eBay dominates the online auction market, followed by eBid and uBid. 
In the last several years eBay’s growth has slowed considerably as consumers shift 
toward Buy It Now purchases rather than auctions. Many of the smaller auction sites 
are not profitable because they lack sufficient sellers and buyers to achieve liquidity. 
In auctions, network effects are highly influential, and the tendency is for one or two 
very large auction sites to dominate, with hundreds of smaller specialty auction sites 
(sites that sell specialized goods such as stamps) being barely profitable.
TYPES AND EXAMPLES OF AUCTIONS
The primary types of auctions found on the Internet are English auctions, Dutch 
Internet auctions, Name Your Own Price auctions, and so-called penny auctions. 
The English auction is the easiest to understand and the most common form of 
auction on eBay. Typically, there is a single item up for sale from a single seller. There 
is a time limit when the auction ends, a reserve price below which the seller will not 
sell (usually secret), and a minimum incremental bid set. Multiple buyers bid against 
one another until the auction time limit is reached. The highest bidder wins the item 
(if the reserve price of the seller has been met or exceeded). English auctions are 
considered to be seller-biased because multiple buyers compete against one another—
usually anonymously.
The Dutch Internet auction format is perfect for sellers that have many identical 
items to sell. Sellers start by listing a minimum price, or a starting bid for one item, and 
the number of items for sale. Bidders specify both a bid price and the quantity they want 
to buy. The uniform price reigns. Winning bidders pay the same price per item, which 
is the lowest successful bid. This market clearing price can be less than some bids. If 
there are more buyers than items, the earliest successful bids get the goods. In general, 
high bidders get the quantity they want at the lowest successful price, whereas low suc-
cessful bidders might not get the quantity they want (but they will get something). 
The Name Your Own Price auction was pioneered by Priceline, and is the 
second most-popular auction format on the Web. Although Priceline also acts as an 
intermediary, buying blocks of airline tickets, hotel rooms, and vacation packages at

a discount and selling them at a reduced retail price or matching its inventory to 
bidders, it is best known for its Name Your Own Price auctions, in which users specify 
what they are willing to pay for goods or services, and multiple providers bid for their 
business. Prices do not descend and are fixed: the initial consumer offer is a commit-
ment to purchase at that price. In 2015, Priceline had more than $9.2 billion in revenues, 
and in 2016, it attracts around 20 million unique visitors a month. It is one of the top-
ranked travel sites in the United States. 
But how can Priceline offer such steep discounts off prices for services provided 
by major brand-name providers? There are several answers. First, Priceline “shields the 
brand” by not publicizing the prices at which major brands sell. This reduces conflict with 
traditional channels, including direct sales. Second, the services being sold are perishable: 
if a Priceline customer did not pay something for the empty airline seat, rental car, or 
hotel room, sellers would not receive any revenue. Hence, sellers are highly motivated 
to at least cover the costs of their services by selling in a spot market at very low prices. 
The strategy for sellers is to sell as much as possible through more profitable channels 
and then unload excess capacity on spot markets such as Priceline. This works to the 
advantage of consumers, sellers, and Priceline, which charges a transaction fee to sellers.
So-called penny auctions are really anything but. To participate in a penny auction 
(also known as a bidding fee auction), you typically must pay the penny auction 
site for bids ahead of time, typically 50 cents to $1 dollar, usually in packs costing $25-
$50. Once you have purchased the bids, you can use them to bid on items listed by 
the penny auction site (unlike traditional auctions, items are owned by the site, not 
third parties). Items typically start at or near $0 and each bid raises the price by a fixed 
amount, usually just a penny. Auctions are timed, and when the time runs out, the 
last and highest bidder wins the item. Although the price of the item itself may not 
be that high, the successful bidder will typically have spent much more than that. 
Unlike a traditional auction, it costs money to bid, and that money is gone even if the 
bidder does not win the auction. The bidder’s cumulative cost of bidding must be added 
to the final price of a successful bid to determine the true cost of the item. The Federal 
Trade Commission has issued an alert about penny auctions, warning that bidders 
may find that they spend far more than they intended (Consumer Reports.org, 2013). 
Examples of penny auction sites include QuiBids, Beezid, and HappyBidDay.
WHEN TO USE AUCTIONS (AND FOR WHAT) IN BUSINESS
There are many different situations in which auctions are an appropriate channel for 
businesses to consider. For much of this chapter, we have looked at auctions from a 
consumer point of view. The objective of consumers is to receive the greatest value 
for the lowest cost. Now, switch your perspective to that of a business. Remember that 
the objective of businesses using auctions is to maximize their revenue (their share of 
consumer surplus) by finding the true market value of products and services, a market 
value that hopefully is higher in the auction channel than in fixed-price channels. 
Table 11.6 provides an overview of factors to consider.
The factors are described as follows:
•	 Type of product: Online auctions are most commonly used for rare and unique 
products for which prices are difficult to discover, and there may have been no 
penny (bidding fee) 
auction
bidder must pay a non-
refundable fee to purchase 
bids

market for the goods. However, Priceline has succeeded in developing auctions 
for perishable commodities (such as airline seats) for which retail prices have 
already been established, and some B2B auctions involve commodities such as 
steel (often sold at distress prices). New clothing items, new digital cameras, and 
new computers are generally not sold at auction because their prices are easy 
to discover, catalog prices are high, sustainable, and profitable, they are not per-
ishable, and there exists an efficient market channel in the form of retail stores 
(online and offline).
•	 Product life cycle: For the most part, businesses have traditionally used auctions 
for goods at the end of their product life cycle and for products where auctions yield 
a higher price than fixed-price liquidation sales. However, products at the beginning 
of their life cycle are increasingly being sold at auction. Early releases of music, 
books, videos, games, and digital appliances can be sold to highly motivated early 
adopters who want to be the first in their neighborhood with new products. Online 
auctions and sales of event tickets from music concerts to sports events now account 
for more than 50% of all event ticket sales in the United States.
•	 Channel management: Established retailers such as JCPenney and Walmart, and 
manufacturers in general, must be careful not to allow their auction activity to 
interfere with their existing profitable channels. For this reason, items found on 
established retail-site auctions tend to be late in their product life cycle or have 
quantity purchase requirements.
•	 Type of auction: Sellers obviously should choose auctions where there are many 
buyers and only a few, or even one, seller. English ascending-price auctions such 
as those at eBay are best for sellers because as the number of bidders increases, 
the price tends to move higher.
•	 Initial pricing: Research suggests that auction items should start out with low initial 
bid prices in order to encourage more bidders to bid (see “Bid increments” below). 

742	
	
C H A P T E R  1 1     S o c i a l  N e t w o r k s ,  A u c t i o n s ,  a n d  P o r t a l s 
The lower the price, the larger the number of bidders will appear. The larger the 
number of bidders, the higher the prices move.
•	 Bid increments: It is generally safest to keep bid increments low so as to increase 
the number of bidders and the frequency of their bids. If bidders can be convinced 
that, for just a few more dollars, they can win the auction, then they will tend to 
make the higher bid and forget about the total amount they are bidding.
•	 Auction length: In general, the longer auctions are scheduled, the larger the 
number of bidders and the higher the prices can go. However, once the new bid 
arrival rate drops off and approaches zero, bid prices stabilize. Most eBay auctions 
are scheduled for seven days.
•	 Number of items: When a business has a number of items to sell, buyers usually 
expect a “volume discount,” and this expectation can cause lower bids in return. 
Therefore, sellers should consider breaking up very large bundles into smaller 
bundles auctioned at different times.
•	 Price allocation rule: Most buyers believe it is “fair” that everyone pay the same 
price in a multi-unit auction, and a uniform pricing rule is recommended. eBay 
Dutch Internet auctions encourage this expectation. The idea that some buyers 
should pay more based on their differential need for the product is not widely sup-
ported. Therefore, sellers who want to price discriminate should do so by holding 
auctions for the same goods on different auction markets, or at different times, to 
prevent direct price comparison.
•	 Closed vs. open bidding: Closed bidding has many advantages for the seller, and 
sellers should use this approach whenever possible because it permits price dis-
crimination without offending buyers. However, open bidding carries the advantage 
of “herd effects” and “winning effects” (described later in the chapter) in which 
consumers’ competitive instincts to “win” drive prices higher than even secret 
bidding would achieve.
AUCTION PRICES: ARE THEY THE LOWEST?
It is widely assumed that auction prices are lower than prices in other fixed-price 
markets. Empirical evidence is mixed on this assumption. There are many reasons 
why auction prices might be higher than those in fixed-price markets for items of 
identical quality, and why auction prices in one auction market may be higher than 
those in other auction markets. Consumers are not driven solely by value maximiza-
tion but instead are influenced by many situational factors, irrelevant and wrong 
information, and misperceptions when they make market decisions (Simonson and 
Tversky, 1992). Auctions are social events—shared social environments, in which 
bidders adjust to one another (Hanson and Putler, 1996). Briefly, bidders base their 
bids on what others have previously bid, and this can lead to an upward cascading 
effect (Arkes and Hutzel, 2000). In a study of hundreds of eBay auctions for Sony 
PlayStations, CD players, Mexican pottery, and Italian silk ties, Dholakia and Soltysin-
ski (2001) found that bidders exhibited herd behavior (the tendency to gravitate 
toward, and bid for, auction listings with one or more existing bids) by making mul-
tiple bids on some auctions (coveted comparables), and making no bids at auctions

listings with one or more 
existing bids

743
for comparable items (overlooked comparables). Herd behavior resulted in consumers 
paying higher prices than necessary for reasons having no foundation in economic 
reality (Liu and Sutanto, 2012).
The behavioral reality of participating in auctions can produce many unintended 
results. Winners can suffer winner’s regret, the feeling after winning an auction that 
they paid too much for an item, which indicates that their winning bid does not reflect 
what they thought the item was worth but rather what the second bidder thought the 
item was worth. Sellers can experience seller’s lament, reflecting the fact that they 
sold an item at a price just above the second place bidder, never knowing how much 
the ultimate winner might have paid or the true value to the final winner. Auction 
losers can experience loser’s lament, the feeling of having been too cheap in bidding 
and failing to win. In summary, auctions can lead to both winners paying too much 
and sellers receiving too little. Both of these outcomes can be minimized when sellers 
and buyers have a very clear understanding of the prices for items in a variety of dif-
ferent online and offline markets.
CONSUMER TRUST IN AUCTIONS
Auction sites have the same difficulties creating a sense of consumer trust as all other 
e-commerce sites, although in the case of auction sites, the operators of the marketplace 
do not directly control the quality of goods being offered and cannot directly vouch 
for the integrity of the buyers or the sellers. This opens the possibility for criminal 
or unreliable actors to appear as either sellers or buyers. Several studies have found 
that trust and credibility increase as users gain more experience, if trusted third-party 
seals are present, and if the site has a wide variety of consumer services for tracking 
purchases (or fraud), thus giving the user a sense of control (Krishnamurthy, 2001; 
Stanford-Makovsky, 2002; Nikander and Karvonen, 2002; Bailey et al., 2002; Kollock, 
1999). Because of the powerful role that trust plays in online consumer behavior, 
eBay and most auction sites make considerable efforts to develop automated trust-
enhancing mechanisms such as seller and buyer ratings, escrow services, buyer and 
seller insurance, guaranteed money back features, and authenticity guarantees (see 
the next section).
WHEN AUCTION MARKETS FAIL: FRAUD AND ABUSE IN AUCTIONS
Online and offline auction markets can be prone to fraud, which produces informa-
tion asymmetries between sellers and buyers and among buyers, which in turn causes 
auction markets to fail. Some of the possible abuses and frauds include:
•	 Bid rigging: Agreeing offline to limit bids or using shills to submit false bids that 
drive prices up.
•	 Price matching: Agreeing informally or formally to set floor prices on auction 
items below which sellers will not sell in open markets.
•	 Shill feedback, defensive: Using secondary IDs or other auction members to 
inflate seller ratings.
•	 Shill feedback, offensive: Using secondary IDs or other auction members to 
deflate ratings for another user (feedback bombs).

•	 Feedback extortion: Threatening negative feedback in return for a benefit.
•	 Transaction interference: E-mailing buyers to warn them away from a seller.
•	 Bid manipulation: Using the retraction option to make high bids, discovering the 
maximum bid of the current high bidder, and then retracting the bid.
•	 Non-payment after winning: Blocking legitimate buyers by bidding high, then 
not paying.
•	 Shill bidding: Using secondary user IDs or other auction members to artificially 
raise the price of an item.
•	 Transaction non-performance: Accepting payment and failing to deliver.
•	 Non-selling seller: Refusing payment or failing to deliver after a successful auction.
•	 Bid siphoning: E-mailing another seller’s bidders and offering the same product 
for less.
Auction sites have sought to reduce these risks through various methods including:
•	 Rating systems: Previous customers rate sellers based on their experience with 
them and post them on the site for other buyers to see.
•	 Watch lists: These allow buyers to monitor specific auctions as they proceed over 
a number of days and only pay close attention in the last few minutes of bidding.
•	 Proxy bidding: Buyers can enter a maximum price they are willing to pay, and 
the auction software will automatically place incremental bids as their original bid 
is surpassed.
eBay and many other auction sites have investigation units that receive complaints 
from consumers and investigate reported abuses. Nevertheless, with millions of visitors 
per week and hundreds of thousands of auctions to monitor, eBay is highly dependent 
on the good faith of sellers and consumers to follow the rules.
	11.3	 E-COMMERCE PORTALS 
Port: From the Latin porta, an entrance or gateway to a locality.
Portals are among the most frequently visited sites on the Web if only because they 
often are the homepage page to which many users point their browser on startup. The 
top portals such as Yahoo, MSN, and AOL have hundreds of millions of unique visitors 
worldwide each month. Portal sites are gateways to the billions of web pages available 
on the Internet. Facebook also acts as a home page portal to the Web. Millions of users 
have set Facebook as their home page, choosing to start their sessions with news from 
their friends, and many stay on Facebook for several hours a day. We have already 
discussed Facebook in Section 11.1. Perhaps the most important service provided by 
portals is to help people find the information they are looking for on the Web and, like 
newspapers, to expose people to information they were not looking for but which they 
nonetheless may find entertaining or interesting. The original portals in the early days 
of e-commerce were search engines. Consumers would pass through search engine 
portals on their way to rich, detailed, in-depth content on the Web. But portals evolved 

	
E - c o m m e r c e  P o r t a l s  	 
745
into much more complex websites that provide news, entertainment, maps, images, 
social networks, in-depth information, and education on a growing variety of topics all 
contained at the portal site. Portals today seek to be a sticky destination site, not merely 
a gateway through which visitors pass. In this respect, portals are very much like televi-
sion networks: destination sites for content supported by advertising revenues. Portals 
today want visitors to stay a long time—the longer the better to expose visitors to ads. 
For the most part they succeed: portals are places where people linger for a long time. 
Portals also serve important functions within a business or organization. Most 
corporations, universities, churches, and other formal organizations have enterprise 
portals that help employees or members navigate to important content, such as human 
resources information, corporate news, or organizational announcements. For instance, 
your university has a portal through which you can register for courses, find classroom 
assignments, and perform a host of other important student activities. Increasingly, 
these enterprise portals also provide general-purpose news and real-time financial 
feeds provided by content providers outside the organization. Corporate portals and 
intranets are the subject of other textbooks focused on the corporate uses of web 
technology and are beyond the scope of this book (see Laudon and Laudon, 2016). Our 
focus here is on e-commerce portals.
THE GROWTH AND EVOLUTION OF PORTALS
Portals have changed a great deal from their initial function and role. As noted above, most 
of today’s well-known portals, such as Yahoo, MSN, and AOL, began as search engines. 
The initial function provided by portals was to index web page content and make this 
content available to users in a convenient form. Early portals expected visitors to stay 
only a few minutes at the site. As millions of people signed on to the Internet in the early 
2000s, the number of visitors to basic search engine sites exploded commensurately. At 
first, few people understood how a web search site could make money by passing cus-
tomers on to other destinations. But search sites attracted huge audiences, and therein 
lay the foundation for their success as vehicles for marketing and advertising. Search 
sites, recognizing the potential for commerce, expanded their offerings from simple 
navigation to include commerce (the sale of items directly from the website as well as 
advertising for other retail sites), content (in the form of news at first, and later in the 
form of weather, investments, games, health, and other subject matter), communications 
(email, chat, and texting), and distribution of others’ content. These four characteristics 
have become the basic definition of portal sites, namely, sites that provide four functions: 
navigation of the Web (search), communications, commerce, and content. 
Because the value of portals to advertisers and content owners is largely a function 
of the size of the audience each portal reaches, and the length of time visitors stay on 
site, portals compete with one another on reach and unique visitors. Reach is defined as 
the percentage of the web audience that visits the site in a month (or some other time 
period), and unique visitors is defined as the number of uniquely identified individuals 
who visit in a month. Portals are inevitably subject to network effects: The value of 
the portal to advertisers and consumers increases geometrically as reach increases, 
which, in turn, attracts still more customers. These effects have resulted in the dif-
ferentiation of the portal marketspace into three tiers: a few general-purpose mega 
enterprise portals

the enterprise’s human 
resource and corporate

portal sites that garner 60%–80% of the web audience, second-tier general-purpose sites 
that hover around 20%–30% reach, and third-tier specialized vertical market portals 
that attract 2%–10% of the audience. As described in Chapter 3, the top five portals/
search engines (Google, Yahoo, MSN/Bing, AOL, and Ask) account for more than 95% 
of online searches. A similar pattern of concentration is observed when considering 
the audience share of portals/search engines (including both desktop and mobile) as 
illustrated in Figure 11.4. However, this picture is changing as large audiences move 
to social network sites, and millions of users make these sites their opening or home 
pages and the place where they spend most of their digital time. Social network sites 
like Facebook are broadening their content with videos, movies, and news, transform-
ing themselves into a hybrid social network and portal. 
For more insight into the nature of the competition and change among the top 
portals, read Insight on Business: Verizon Doubles Down on Portals.
TYPES OF PORTALS: GENERAL-PURPOSE AND VERTICAL MARKET
There are two primary types of portals: general-purpose portals and vertical market 
portals. General-purpose portals attempt to attract a very large general audience 
and then retain the audience on-site by providing in-depth vertical content channels, 
such as information on news, finance, autos, movies, and weather. General-purpose 
portals typically offer search engines, free e-mail, personal home pages, chat rooms, 
community-building software, and bulletin boards. Vertical content channels on 
general-purpose portal sites offer content such as sports scores, stock tickers, health 
tips, instant messaging, automobile information, and auctions.

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
VERIZON DOUBLES DOWN ON PORTALS
In the early years of the Internet, 
portals were among the most high-
profile of business models. AOL and 
Yahoo were two of the most prominent. 
In 2000, Time Warner bought AOL for 
$168 billion and Yahoo was worth about 
$128 billion. However, as the years passed, Google 
developed a stranglehold on the search market and 
social networks such as Facebook have largely 
usurped the role that portals originally played in 
online life. Both AOL and Yahoo struggled and 
undertook various efforts to transform their busi-
nesses to make them more relevant in today’s 
online environment. 
Over the last few years, Verizon, the U.S. broad-
band and wireless telecommunications giant, has 
been facing a similar issue, but for different reasons. 
Verizon is a direct descendant of the original Bell 
Telephone Company of the early 20th century. Today, 
Verizon is the largest wireless cell phone service pro-
vider in the United States, with 140 million subscrib-
ers (46% of the market), followed by AT&T with 
128 million (33%). Other major providers include 
T-Mobile and Sprint. Verizon also controls around 
35% of the landline (wireline) market. In 2015, 
Verizon generated revenue of $131 billion. Most 
of this (70%) came from its wireless cell phone 
network segment. The rest comes from its wireline 
segment, which owns and operates the copper and 
fiber optic cables in buildings, underground, and 
under the sea that are used by major corporations 
and Internet providers.
Despite Verizon’s obvious size and market 
dominance, it is facing troubled times in the wire-
less business. Competitors like AT&T, Sprint, and 
T-Mobile have put a lid on the fees Verizon can 
charge wireless customers. Revenue in the wireless 
segment grew only 4% in 2015, while the wireline 
segment lost 1.5%. Microsoft, Google, Apple, Skype, 
and Facebook offer alternative communications over 
the Internet that drain revenue from all of the wire-
less telephone networks. The growth of Wi-Fi con-
nections in urban areas also competes with Verizon 
cellular wireless networks. Smartphones typically 
default to Wi-Fi when available. The market for 
wireless experienced extraordinary growth follow-
ing the introduction of the Apple iPhone in 2007, 
but the market for connecting people with mobile 
cell voice, text, and video is approaching saturation, 
and is no longer a growth story. It has become clear 
that there’s more money in owning the media con-
tent, the audience, and the brand than owning the 
pipes. So in a remarkable, unprecedented corporate 
makeover, Verizon has decided to become an online 
media and digital advertising company, a business 
in which it has no prior experience! 
To achieve its plan of becoming a major player 
in online media and advertising, Verizon needs to 
build an audience. To attract the audience, it needs 
digital content, preferably video, which seems to 
have an insatiable online audience. The plan target 
is 2 billion viewers by 2020. With billions of eye-
balls, Verizon hopes to become a media and adver-
tising power house that can challenge Facebook 
and YouTube (Google) for a sizable chunk of the 
burgeoning online ad market, which is growing at 
over 20% annually. Now that’s high-tech growth 
country! Analysts wondered how a phone company 
could become an Internet media and ad company. 
The answer: buy them.
To put this plan in to action, in 2014, Verizon 
bought AOL for $4.4 billion. Analysts at the time 
wondered why Verizon would buy a fading star 
portal. The answer would soon become clear: an 
online audience of 400 million and lots of digital 
content. In addition, AOL also operated one of the

largest digital advertising firms (AOL Plat-
forms). With the AOL purchase, Verizon also 
picked up dozens of Internet content companies 
that AOL had previously acquired, such as video 
streaming firms EdgeCast Networks, OnCue, and 
UpLynk; blogs Engadget and TechCrunch; news 
sites like Huffington Post, along with three video 
platforms (5MinMedia, AdapTV, and Vidible); as 
well as a mobile advertising company Millennial 
Media, and a social sharing technology company, 
Thing Labs. If some of these names are unfamil-
iar, it’s because they are mostly small, relatively 
unknown, short-form, low-budget video produc-
tion and distribution companies focused on the 
teen and young adult audience. Verizon has also 
invested along with Hearst in ComplexMedia, a 
music and pop-culture site and along with Dream-
Works Animation and Hearst in AwesomenessTV. 
AwesomenessTV started as a YouTube channel and 
has begun to create original web series, TV shows, 
and films aimed at teenagers. AwesomenessTV has 
150 million subscribers. In 2015, Verizon launched 
go90, a free, ad-supported streaming service that 
offers original series such as The Runner, Tween Fest, 
and comedy shows. Verizon customers’ accounts 
will not be charged minutes for using the service. 
Critics claim this is in violation of the FCC’s new net 
neutrality regulations, which prohibit discrimina-
tion on basis of platform or content. Verizon is also 
pursuing more mainstream content and has been 
reported to be meeting with Hollywood production 
studios seeking original long-form programming 
that is suited to digital distribution. Hulu, Amazon, 
Netflix, and Google are the targets. 
In 2016, expanding on this strategy, Verizon 
agreed to purchase Yahoo, another failing portal, for 
$4.83 billion. Yahoo was unsuccessful in developing 
its own original content, but is the king of display ads 
and supporting technology, with over 1 billion users 
worldwide, including 600 million who access the site 
via a mobile device. The acquisition is scheduled to 
close sometime during the first quarter of 2017. 
If Verizon is successful in attracting 2 billion 
viewers by 2020, it can enter the rapidly growing 
business of Internet advertising, and compete with 
Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and other content 
companies in the streaming video market. Verizon’s 
geolocation technology, which is built into its mobile 
network and keeps track of every mobile user around 
the clock, can be used to target users based on 
their activities and location. As the leading wireless 
provider, Verizon knows more about the location of 
people and things, and how they got there, than the 
people or things themselves. 
There are plenty of doubters that Verizon can 
effectively manage all these acquisitions and become a 
multifaceted portal conglomerate. Verizon’s supposed 
unique advantage is that it has a mobile customer 
base of 144 million customers and knows their loca-
tion. So do Google Maps and Apple’s iPhones. It is 
unclear at this point if Verizon can compete against 
the reigning Internet titans who now dominate social 
networks, web media, and online advertising. But it 
will be exciting to find out how this bet turns out.

Vertical market portals (sometimes also referred to as destination sites or vortals) 
attempt to attract highly focused, loyal audiences with a deep interest in either com-
munity or specialized content—from sports to the weather. In addition to their focused 
content, vertical market portals have recently begun adding many of the features 
found in general-purpose portals. For instance, in addition to being a social network, 
you can also think of Facebook as a portal—the home page for millions of users, and 
a gateway to the Internet. Facebook is an affinity group portal because it is based on 
friendships among people. Facebook offers e-mail, search, games, and apps. 
The concentration of audience share in the portal market reflects (in addition 
to network effects) the limited time budget of consumers. This limited time budget 
works to the advantage of general-purpose portals. Consumers have a finite amount of 
time to spend on the Web, and as a result, most consumers visit fewer than 30 unique 
domains each month. Facing limited time, consumers concentrate their visits at sites 
that can satisfy a broad range of interests, from weather and travel information, to 
stocks, sports, retail shopping, and entertainment content.
General-purpose sites such as Yahoo try to be all things to all people and attract a broad 
audience with both generalized navigation services and in-depth content and community 
efforts. For instance, Yahoo has become the Web’s largest source of news: more people visit 
Yahoo News than any other news site including online newspapers. Yet recent changes 
in consumer behavior on the Web show that consumers are spending less time “surfing 
the Web” and on general browsing, and more time doing focused searches, research, and 
participating in social networks. These trends will advantage special-purpose, vertical 
market sites that can provide focused, in-depth community and content. 
As a general matter, the general-purpose portals are very well-known brands, 
while the vertical content and affinity group portals tend to have less well-known 
brands. Figure 11.5 lists examples of general-purpose portals and the two main types 
of vertical market portals.

PORTAL BUSINESS MODELS
Portals receive income from a number of different sources. The revenue base of portals 
is changing and dynamic, with some of the largest sources of revenue declining. Table 
11.7 summarizes the major portal revenue sources.
The business strategies of both general-purpose and vertical portals have changed 
greatly because of the rapid growth in search engine advertising and intelligent ad 
placement networks such as Google’s AdSense, which can place ads on thousands of 
websites based on content. General portal sites such as AOL and Yahoo did not have 
well-developed search engines, and hence have not grown as fast as Google, which 
has a powerful search engine. Microsoft, for instance, has invested billions of dollars 
in its Bing search engine to catch up with Google. On the other hand, general portals 
have content, which Google did not originally have, although it added to its content 
by purchasing YouTube and adding Google sites devoted to news, financial informa-
tion, images, and maps. Facebook users stay on-site and linger three times as long as 
visitors to traditional portals like Yahoo. For this reason social network sites, Facebook 
in particular, are direct competitors of Yahoo, Google, and the other portals. Yahoo 
has struggled in the last three years to grow revenues and earnings despite the fact 
that its unique visitor count has held steady with Google’s. One part of the problem is 
the falling price of display ads, which are the mainstay of Yahoo’s ad platform. Yahoo 
shows more display ads on its sites than any other web destination. Another key issue 
is declining user engagement with materials on the site and the amount of time spent 
on the site. To address these issues, Yahoo has made a number of acquisitions includ-
ing Aviate, Tumblr, and Flickr, and launched digital magazines like Yahoo Food and 
Yahoo Tech that curate content from around the Web. The key to display ad revenue 
is content and engagement: the more you can show users, the longer they stay on 
your site, the more ad revenue can be generated. So far, Yahoo and the other general 
portal sites have not been able to compete with social network sites on these dimen-
sions of engagement and time on site. After several years of pursuing unsuccessful 
new strategies, Yahoo agreed to sell itself to Verizon in 2016.

The survival strategy for general-purpose portals in the future is therefore to 
develop deep, rich vertical content in order to reach and engage customers at the 
site. This involves hiring professional journalists rather than relying on bloggers who 
write listicle articles, and offering more quality entertainment in the form of movies, 
TV series, and music. The strategy for much smaller vertical market portals is to put 
together a collection of vertical portals to form a vertical portal network, a collection 
of deep, rich content sites. The strategy for search engine sites such as Google is to 
obtain more content to attract users for a long time and expose them to more ad pages 
(or screens).

hen you hear someone mention online auctions, the first site 
that comes to mind is likely eBay. Founded in 1995 as an offbeat, 
quirky place to buy and sell almost anything via auctions, eBay now 
derives the majority of its revenue from traditional e-commerce. 
As the company continues to model its business after competitors such as Amazon 
and Alibaba, eBay has banned the sales of quirkier services like tarot card readings 
and magic spells, and has instituted a rewards program with prominent retail chains 
like Dick’s Sporting Goods and Toys “R” Us. 
The transformation began in November 2007, when former CEO Meg Whitman 
exited and was replaced by John Donahoe. The company had already begun to stall, 
and the trend continued through 2009. For many buyers, the novelty of online auctions 
had worn off, and they were returning to easier and simpler methods of buying fixed-
price goods from retailers such as Amazon, which, by comparison, had steady growth 
during the same time period. Search engines and comparison shopping sites were also 
taking away some of eBay’s auction business by making items easier to find on the Web.
Donahoe quickly found that dramatically altering the business model of an Internet 
company is never easy, particularly when that company is one of the most recognizable 
sites on the Web. His three-year revival plan moved eBay away from its origins as an

online flea market, and at first it began to resemble an outlet mall where retailers sold 
out-of-season, overstocked, refurbished, or discontinued merchandise. From there it 
was a straightforward progression to partnering with retail chains to simply serve as 
another channel for current merchandise.
Small sellers were encouraged to shift away from the auction format and move 
toward the fixed-price sales model. The fee structure was adjusted, listing fees for 
fixed-price sales were lowered, improvements were made to the search engine, and 
rather than displaying ending auctions first, a formula was devised that took into 
account price and seller reputation so that highly rated merchants appeared first and 
received more exposure.
Unsurprisingly, the growing pains during this period included increasing com-
plaints from sellers about excessive fees and eBay’s favoritism toward big retailers. The 
hundreds of thousands of people who supported themselves by selling on eBay and 
many millions more who used eBay to supplement their income often felt slighted. 
With its stock continuing to drop, analysts’ faith that Donahoe could turn things around 
dwindled. This pessimism failed to account for eBay’s history of sensible growth marked 
by a number of canny purchases.
Its signature purchase was, of course, PayPal, whose payment services enable the 
exchange of money between individuals over the Internet. This acquisition was the key 
to eBay’s endurance through the lean years, protecting it from weakness in its auction 
business, and the propeller that pushed it towards the future. PayPal has accounted for 
over 40% of eBay’s revenues at its peak, and was a significant factor in eBay’s growth. 
eBay recognized the coming mobile revolution even before the first iPhone or the 
establishment of the App Store, according to Olivier Ropars, senior director of Mobile 
Commerce. This prescience resulted in eBay achieving its 100 millionth app download 
and 100 millionth mobile listing relatively early on, in 2012. Dating back to 2010, eBay 
has been actively acquiring companies specializing in mobile technologies, such as 
barcode scanning app RedLaser, mobile app developer Critical Path, mobile payment 
and billing firm Zong, and mobile payment startup Fig Card. In 2013, eBay acquired 
mobile payment gateway Braintree for $800 million. Braintree’s technology allows 
eBay consumers to more easily make payments on smartphones and tablets, and the 
acquisition also eliminated a major competitor in that space for PayPal. In 2015, eBay 
introduced an app for the Apple Watch that allows users to see an overview of their 
notifications and bid statuses. The company also rolled out more updates for their iOS 
and Android apps that improve the quality of search results. In 2016, eBay remains 
on the cutting edge of online retail, redesigning its core mobile platform and adding 
biometric touch identification support, launching its Marketplace app for Android 
Wear wearable devices, and releasing a virtual reality feature on StubHub that allows 
customers to see their prospective seats from any angle. Over 50% of eBay’s business 
now involves a mobile device, and the company continues to make improvements to 
the mobile experience across all of its different services.
While many other acquisitions through the years have also helped to transform 
eBay from an online garage sale to a mainstream competitor with Amazon, its adoption 
of the “social, mobile, local” driving theme has been central to its survival. Positioning 
itself at the center of the online—offline—mobile triangle by offering a wide variety of

services that enable merchants to more easily integrate their cross-channel retailing 
has been the key to eBay’s resurgence and to its continued success. 
In 2016, the company has also started the process of modernizing its platform with 
analytical tools. First, the company has started to convert its catalog of items from its 
traditional unstructured “listing” format, where two identical items can appear totally 
different to shoppers, to a structured data format. This will allow eBay to more easily 
gain information about different items and about purchasing trends. eBay is also using 
machine learning to customize, update, and generally improve its product pages, as well as 
to fine-tune its search capability beyond simply matching search terms with keywords and 
tags. To support these efforts, in 2016, the company purchased machine-learning startup 
SalesPredict, whose technology helps businesses predict consumer buying behavior and 
sales conversion. Finally, the company’s revamped Seller Hub will offer many of these 
analytical tools and metrics to individual sellers, including inventory, order, and listing 
management, performance insights, and streamlined business process management.
However, eBay’s return to prominence is not without continuing challenges. In 
2014, eBay was the victim of a hacking attack that compromised the information of 
nearly 150 million of its customers. Paypal was unaffected, and the company doesn’t 
believe that any financial information was stolen, but the incident underscored the need 
for eBay to remain vigilant with its security measures. eBay sales decreased steeply 
in the wake of the breach, dropping 5.4% in 10 days. Competitors are also ramping 
up their efforts to battle eBay, with Amazon continuing to focus on third-party sales 
and Alibaba announcing a U.S.-based site to compete with eBay called 11 Main. What’s 
more, Google rolled out an update to its search algorithm, reducing eBay’s search 
traffic by as much as 33%. eBay hopes that standardizing its product pages will also 
help improve its rankings in Google searches.
In 2015, eBay elected to spin off PayPal as its own separate company, leaving eBay 
with its Marketplaces segment, its StubHub ticket sales segment, and a handful of 
other business units. Although Donahoe and the rest of eBay’s leadership had resisted 
a spinoff for years, the move was prompted by a desire for PayPal to distinguish itself 
from eBay and become more agile within the rapidly-developing marketplace of online 
payments. Donahoe also stepped down as CEO of eBay to mark the transition, with the 
former head of its Global Marketplaces unit, Devin Wenig, taking his place. As part of 
the split, eBay has agreed to route 80% of its sales through PayPal, but PayPal is free to 
pursue deals with other merchants, potentially boosting its market share even further. 
Many investors believed that PayPal had been the true driver of eBay’s bottom 
line. But while analysts had prepared themselves for disappointing earnings, the 
company has instead posted several straight quarters of sales growth under Wenig as 
of 2016. This includes a 5.7% increase over its earnings from the previous year in the 
second quarter of 2016, with $2.23 billion in revenue, up from $2.11 billion in 2015. The 
company also reported that it expected continued growth for the upcoming quarters. 
Despite Amazon’s ongoing dominance in online retail, eBay remains one of the most 
trusted online brands and e-commerce leaders, and it has worked hard to improve its 
marketplace design and offerings for dedicated users, including eBay Now, its new 
same-day delivery program. Will eBay be able to respond to these new challenges as 
well as it has to those in the past without PayPal to bolster it? After some ups and 
downs, eBay appears to be on a winning trajectory once again.

K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Describe the different types of social networks and online communities and their business models.
•	
Social networks involve a group of people, shared social interaction, common ties among members, and a 
shared area for some period of time. An online social network is one where people who share common 
ties can interact with one another online.
•	
The different types of social networks and communities and their business models include: 
•	
General communities: Members can interact with a general audience segmented into numerous differ-
ent groups. Most general communities began as non-commercial subscription-based endeavors, but 
many have been purchased by larger community portal sites.
•	
Practice networks: Members can participate in discussion groups and get help or information relating 
to an area of shared practice, such as art, education, or medicine. These generally have a nonprofit 
business model in which they simply attempt to collect enough in subscription fees, sales commis-
sions, and limited advertising to cover the cost of operations.
•	
Interest-based communities: Members can participate in focused discussion groups on a shared inter-
est. The advertising business model has worked because the targeted audience is attractive to mar-
keters. Tenancy and sponsorship deals provide another similar revenue stream.
•	
Affinity communities: Members can participate in focused discussions with others who share the 
same affinity or group identification. The business model is a mixture of subscription revenue 
from premium content and services, advertising, tenancy/sponsorships, and distribution agree-
ments.
•	
Sponsored communities: Members can participate in online communities created by government, 
nonprofit, or for-profit organizations for the purpose of pursuing organizational goals. They use com-
munity technologies and techniques to distribute information or extend brand influence. The goal of 
a branded product site is to increase offline product sales. These sites do not seek to make a profit 
and are often cost centers.
Describe the major types of auctions, their benefits and costs, how they operate, when to use them, and the potential 
for auction abuse and fraud.
•	
Auctions are markets where prices vary (dynamic pricing) depending on the competition among the 
participants who are buying or selling products or services. They can be classified broadly as C2C or B2C, 

756	
	
C H A P T E R  1 1     S o c i a l  N e t w o r k s ,  A u c t i o n s ,  a n d  P o r t a l s 
although generally the term C2C auction refers to the venue in which the sale takes place, for example, a 
consumer-oriented website such as eBay, which also auctions items from established merchants. A B2C 
auction refers to an established online merchant that offers its own auctions. There are also numerous 
B2B online auctions for buyers of industrial parts, raw materials, commodities, and services. Within these 
three broad categories of auctions are several major auction types classified based upon how the bidding 
mechanisms work in each system:
•	
English auctions: A single item is up for sale from a single seller. Multiple buyers bid against one 
another within a specific time frame with the highest bidder winning the object as long as the high 
bid has exceeded the reserve bid set by the seller, below which he or she refuses to sell.
•	
Dutch Internet auctions: Sellers with many identical items for sale list a minimum price or starting 
bid, and buyers indicate both a bid price and a quantity desired. The lowest winning bid that clears 
the available quantity is paid by all winning bidders. Those with the highest bid are assured of 
receiving the quantity they desire but only pay the amount of the lowest successful bid (uniform 
pricing rule).
•	
Name Your Own Price or reverse auctions: Buyers specify the price they are willing to pay for an item, 
and multiple sellers bid for their business. This is one example of discriminatory pricing in which 
winners may pay different amounts for the same product or service depending on how much they 
have bid.
•	
Penny (bidding fee) auctions: Bidder pay a non-refundable fee to purchase bids.
•	
Benefits of auctions include: liquidity, price discovery, price transparency, market efficiency, lower trans-
action costs, consumer aggregation, network effects, and market-maker benefits.
•	
Costs of auctions include: delayed consumption, monitoring costs, equipment costs, trust risks, and ful-
fillment costs.
•	
Auction sites have sought to reduce these risks through various methods including rating systems, watch 
lists, and proxy bidding.
•	
Auctions can be an appropriate channel for businesses to sell items in a variety of situations. The factors 
for businesses to consider include the type of product, the product life cycle, channel management, the 
type of auction, initial pricing, bid increments, auction length, number of items, price allocation, and 
closed versus open bidding.
•	
Auctions are particularly prone to fraud, which produces information asymmetries between buyers and 
sellers. Some of the possible abuses and frauds include bid rigging, price matching, defensive shill feed-
back, offensive shill feedback, feedback extortion, transaction interference, bid manipulation, non-pay-
ment after winning, shill bidding, transaction non-performance, non-selling sellers, and bid siphoning.
Describe the major types of Internet portals and their business models.
•	
Portals are gateways to billions of web pages available on the Internet. Originally, their primary purpose 
was to help users find information on the Web, but they evolved into destination sites that provided a 
myriad of content from news to entertainment. Today, portals serve three main purposes: navigation of 
the Web (search), content, and commerce. 
•	
Among the major portal types are:
•	
Enterprise portals: Corporations, universities, churches, and other organizations create these sites to 
help employees or members navigate to important content such as corporate news or organizational 
announcements.
•	
General-purpose portals: Examples are AOL, Yahoo, and MSN, which try to attract a very large general 
audience by providing many in-depth vertical content channels. Some also offer ISP services on a 
subscription basis, search engines, e-mail, chat, bulletin boards, and personal home pages.
•	
Vertical market portals: Also called destination sites, they attempt to attract a highly focused, loyal 
audience with an intense interest in either a community they belong to or an interest they hold. 

	
R e v i e w 	

757
Vertical market portals can be divided into two main classifications, although hybrids that overlap 
the two classifications also exist.
•	
Affinity groups: Designed to serve aggregates of people who identify themselves by their attitudes, 
values, beliefs, and behavior. 
•	
Focused content portals: These sites contain in-depth information on a particular topic that all mem-
bers are interested in. They can provide content on such broad topics as sports, news, weather, 
entertainment, finance, or business, or they can appeal to a much more focused interest group such 
as boat, horse, or video game enthusiasts.
•	
Portals receive revenue from a number of different sources. The business model is presently changing 
and adapting to declines in certain revenue streams, particularly advertising revenues. Revenue sources 
can include general advertising, tenancy deals, subscription fees, and commissions on sales.
•	
The survival strategy for general-purpose portals is to develop deep, rich vertical content in order to 
attract advertisers to various niche groups that they can target with focused ads. The strategy for the 
small vertical market portals is to build a collection of vertical portals, thereby creating a network of 
deep, rich content sites for the same reason.

	 2.	 Examine the use of auctions by businesses. Go to any auction site of your choosing and look for outlet 
auctions or auctions directly from merchants. Research at least three products for sale. What stage in the 
product life cycle do these products fall into? Are there quantity purchasing requirements? What was the 
opening bid price? What are the bid increments? What is the auction duration? Analyze why these firms 
have used the auction channel to sell these goods and prepare a short report on your findings.
	 3.	 Visit one for-profit and one nonprofit sponsored social network. Create a presentation to describe and 
demonstrate the offering at each site. What organizational objectives is each pursuing? How is the for-profit 
company using community-building technologies as a customer relations management tool?
	 4.	 Visit one of the social networks listed in Table 11.1 and compare it to Facebook. In what ways is it 
similar to Facebook, and in what ways is it different? Which do you prefer, and why?

e all know Amazon as the mecca of online 
shopping for consumers. Amazon offers its 
retail customers unparalleled selection, 
speed, customer service, and price. As a result, Amazon has 
become, by far, the world’s largest online retailer and in 
2015, generated about $99 billion from retail e-commerce 
sales. Companies that employ Amazon as a platform to sell 
goods accounted for about 47% of Amazon’s sales. Most 
use Amazon’s Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) service, which 
warehouses the products prior to sale and then fulfills orders 
using Amazon’s payment and delivery system. Less well-
known is that Amazon is also the largest provider of cloud 
computing services ($7.8 billion in sales), a business that it 
started ten years ago. 
Even less well-known is that Amazon is now leveraging 
its experience and computing platform by providing a B2B 
marketplace named Amazon Business, aimed at becoming for businesses what it has 
already become for consumers—an extraordinarily convenient shopping experience for 
just about all things businesses want to buy, and an equally valuable tool for businesses 
of all sizes to sell to other businesses. 
Amazon has its eyes set on capturing a large share of the $6.7 trillion B2B e-
commerce marketspace in the United States, nearly twice the market opportunity provided 
by the $4.8 trillion U.S. retail marketspace. In its first year of operation, Amazon Business, 
which Amazon operates separately from its retail site, has hit $1 billion in B2B sales and 
has a customer list of 400,000 buyers, adding approximately 100,000 new customers 
per quarter. It now offers more than 9 million business-specific items for sale, everything 
from office products, computers, software, to industrial parts, janitorial supplies, medical 
instruments and hospital supplies. In fact, many of the products available on Amazon’s 
retail site are also available on Amazon Business, often with quantity discounts. The only 
requirement for buyers is that they have to prove they are associated with a real business 
and register. 
B2B is not a totally new arena for Amazon, just one it has been quietly growing. 
Amazon entered the B2B space in 2005 with the purchase of Small Parts, a firm 
aimed at selling B2B niche products. Amazon’s own research found that millions of its 
Amazon customers were, in fact, business purchasers who were not well served by the 
retail market aimed at consumers. Amazon rebranded Small Parts in April 2012 as

AmazonSupply after broadening the product mix to over 2.5 million products, identify-
ing specific industries to target, and developing support services like credit payment 
and consolidated invoicing systems desired by sellers and buyers. However, the market 
response was tepid. AmazonSupply was just another single vendor firm (Amazon) of-
fering its catalog to businesses. There were plenty of competitors who had run online 
supply houses for decades, with millions of loyal business customers. 
In 2015, Amazon rebranded the site again as Amazon Business, with over 9 million 
business-specific products, and this time, 30,000 third-party vendors. In doing so, Amazon 
made the transition from being just another distributor of supplies to a real marketplace. 
Amazon charges third-party vendors a 6% to 15% commission on sales, depending on 
the category. For instance, for electronics, where margins are historically thin, Amazon 
charges 6%, compared to industrial and scientific products, where its commission is 
12%. In its first year of operation, Amazon Business increased its buyers by 50%, 
based in large part on its expansion in products offered and third-party vendors, and 
has 400,000 buyers as of June 2016. 
There are significant and unique advantages to both buyers and sellers who use 
Amazon Business. Buyers get access to a powerful product search engine; choices 
from multiple providers; the ability to consolidate purchases from multiple vendors 
at a single location; payment systems; buyer-seller messaging; the ability to designate 
multiple corporate purchasing agents; reporting and control over employee purchases; 
bulk discounts; and detailed product specifications to ensure the purchased products 
meet corporate and government standards (such as ISO 9000 certifications). Other B2B 
services that help both sellers and buyers are credit lines, sales tax exemption, and a 
365-day returns policy. Buyers also can become Amazon B2B Prime customers for no 
fee, and receive 2-day shipping. Not least, buyers get an Amazon-style interface that is 
easy to understand and navigate. 
For third-party sellers, the advantages of selling on Amazon Business include 
scalability of marketing at a single site; global reach; communications with customers; 
predictable customer acquisition costs; a sales reporting system; and visibility into 
customer buying patterns. Using FBA, sellers reduce the hefty costs of warehousing 
the products they sell although Amazon does charge a fee for warehousing third-party 
products. For large firms, Amazon Business will integrate its purchase system with the 
firms’ own enterprise procurement software. For B2B sellers, payment has always been 
a risk, especially for international purchases. Amazon offers a payment escrow service 
that minimizes the payment risk. Most traditional B2B distributors do not offer all these 
services for buyers and sellers.
There are few, if any, downsides in Amazon Business for buyers. There’s plenty 
to like about a “neutral” transparent marketplace where thousands of vendors offer 
competing products, and where there are plenty of purchaser support programs and 
services, all delivered in a very user friendly online environment typical of Amazon for 
retail consumers. Companies with unique needs for goods and services are signing up 
for Amazon Business in droves. Examples include Henkel Corp., the American division 
of global manufacturer Henkel AG. Henkel now buys many of the products it needs to 
operate using Amazon Business. The company particularly relies on Amazon for unique

products that are not covered by its traditional contracts with office suppliers. But it 
isn’t just large manufacturers using Amazon Business. Smaller outfits such as The Third 
Floor, a rapid prototyping company with approximately 200 employees, have also flocked 
to Amazon Business. The Third Floor creates models used to conceptualize Hollywood 
movies. Because it is a unique business, The Third Floor needs many uncommon items. 
Amazon Business not only has these types of items, but also centralizes business spend-
ing so that Third Floor employees can see who is ordering what in the office and how it 
affects the company budget. Even universities like the University of California at San 
Diego (UCSD) have found a good match in Amazon Business. UCSD has a large demand 
for all different types of office supplies, as well as supplies that are unique to individual 
departments, such as biochemical research supplies. UCSD has been so satisfied with 
Amazon Business that the rest of the schools in the UC system are likely to partner 
with Amazon Business as well. 
For sellers, however, it’s a different story. Sellers want to “own” and build a relation-
ship with their customer so they can develop targeted marketing programs, improve 
the relationship, and build long-term loyalty (known as branding). A single-shot sale to 
a customer may lose money, but the hope is to develop long-term customer purchases. 
But businesses who sell through Amazon Business must forego this approach. Amazon 
Business owns the customer, and vendors are prohibited from marketing and selling 
to customers directly “off-market.” The brand is Amazon, not the seller’s brand. Price 
transparency is a real liability for sellers because it prevents them from using price 
discrimination in their marketing, or uniquely branding their products and services as 
somehow differentiated. In a transparent market, especially for commodity items, profits 
are meager. Businesses also have to closely coordinate their Amazon Business store 
with their own websites. For instance, they may not be able to offer special discounts 
on their websites without also offering these discounts on Amazon Business. The fees 
charged by Amazon Business for placement and fulfillment also reduce profits for sellers. 
The interest of B2B marketplaces is to make money from handling transactions, not 
to make sales profitable for participating sellers. On the other hand, Amazon Business 
cannot keep expanding if third-party sellers are losing money. However, so far, these 
apparent disadvantages have not prevented thousands of businesses from trying out 
Amazon Business. 
Amazon Business is itself in an expanding market with many competitors, and this 
fact may restrain its fee structure from squeezing suppliers. For instance, in July 2016 
eBay announced its eBay Business Supply market, which aims to sell business products 
in nine categories, from Manufacturing & Metalworking, to Healthcare and Lab & Life 
Science. eBay claims to already be larger than Amazon Business with more than $4 
billion in B2B transactions on its consumer site. Other services on eBay Business Supply 
include Wholesale Direct (for firms that resell products at large discounts), Commercial 
Direct (an asset management and procurement service), and Express Tech-Financing 
(a finance service from multiple credit services). eBay Business Supply also offers a 
direct link to SAP’s Ariba Spot Buy, which helps firms manage the spot purchases of 
their employees. Like Amazon, eBay is leveraging its consumer brand into the much 
larger trillion dollar B2B marketspace.

buy from hundreds or even thousands of suppliers and in turn, sell to hundreds or 
potentially thousands of distributors and retailers. 
This case frames the two sides of B2B e-commerce: the supply (buy) side and the 
sell side. On the supply side, firms have developed elaborate systems and techniques 
over many decades in order to manage their supply chains and the procurement 
process. Large firms can easily have hundreds or even thousands of suppliers of parts 
and materials. These are referred to as supply chain systems, which are described 
further in this chapter. These supply chain systems lower production costs, increase 
collaboration among firms, speed up new product development, and ultimately have 
revolutionized the way products are designed and manufactured. For instance, in 
the fashion industry, the combination of high-speed Internet-enabled supply chains 
coupled with equally high-speed trendy design not only clears shelves (and reduces the 
likelihood of clearance sales), but increases profits by increasing value to consumers 
(Zarroli, 2013; Cachon and Swinney, 2011). 
The success of Amazon Business provides insight into the sell side of B2B e-com-
merce. All the techniques of marketing, branding, and fulfillment developed in the 
retail e-commerce marketplace come into play when businesses sell to other busi-
nesses. Online websites, display advertising, search engine advertising, e-mail, and 
social media are just as relevant in B2B e-commerce as they are in B2C e-commerce, 
and the technologies involved are the same. For example, as consumers have moved 
to mobile devices to purchase retail goods, so have business procurement and purchas-
ing agents begun to move towards mobile purchasing, inventory management, and 
marketing. 
Amazon Business is one kind of B2B Net marketplace, where thousands of suppli-
ers can interact with thousands of business buyers on an Internet-enabled platform. 
There are many kinds of Net marketplaces described later in the chapter, from simple 
websites where a single company markets to other businesses, to more complex Net 
marketplaces where suppliers, producers, and distributors work collaboratively in 
a digital environment to produce, manufacture, and distribute their products and 
services. 
As you’ll learn in Section 12.1, Net marketplaces such as Amazon Business have 
resulted from a decades-long evolution. In the early years of e-commerce, business 
firms tended to stick with direct purchases from manufacturers who were trusted, long 
term trading partners rather than participate in public B2B markets. Sellers, in turn, 
were reluctant to participate for fear of extreme price competition and brand dilution. 
As a result, B2B e-commerce has evolved much more slowly than B2C e-commerce. 
Many of the early B2B Net marketplaces that emerged in the late 1990s and 2000s 
imploded within a few years. We discuss the reasons for these early failures and 
describe how the new Net marketplaces have learned how to succeed.
Like B2C e-commerce, the B2B marketplace has consolidated, evolved, and moved 
on to more attainable visions.

In this chapter, we examine some major B2B e-commerce themes: procure-
ment, supply chain management, and collaborative commerce. Each of these busi-
ness processes has changed greatly with the evolution of B2B e-commerce systems. 
In Section 12.1, we provide an overview of B2B e-commerce. In Section 12.2, we 
look more closely at the procurement process, and supply chains. In Section 12.3, 
we place B2B e-commerce in the context of trends in procurement, supply chain 
management, and collaborative commerce. The final two sections of this chapter 
describe the two fundamental types of B2B e-commerce: Net marketplaces and 
private industrial networks. 
Table 12.1 summarizes the leading trends in B2B e-commerce in 2016–2017. 
Among the most important trends are growing industry concern with supply chain 
risk and environmental impact, along with a growing public concern with the account-
ability of supply chains—in particular, violations of developed-world expectations of 
working conditions in third-world factories that play a key role in the production of 
goods sold in more developed countries. What many businesses have learned in the 
last decade is that supply chains can strengthen or weaken a company depending on 
a number of factors related to supply chain efficiency such as community engagement, 
labor relations, environmental protection, and sustainability. Many believe that all of 
these related factors are important to a firm’s long-term profitability (Beard and 
Hornik, 2011). Nearly all of the companies included in the S&P 500 stock index now 
use B2B e-commerce systems. Half of all revenues of these firms are produced off-
shore, in part due to the globalization of supply chains. Thousands of smaller firms 
are also now able to employ B2B e-commerce systems as low-cost cloud computing 
and software-as-a-service (SaaS) versions have become widely available. Taking advan-
tage of the mobile platform, more and more companies are using smartphones and 
tablet computers to run their businesses from any location. There are thousands of 
mobile apps available from enterprise B2B vendors such as SAP, IBM, Oracle, and 
others that link to supply chain management systems. Social network tools are pushing 
into the B2B world as well as the consumer world. B2B managers are increasingly 
using public and private social networks and technologies to enable long-term con-
versations with their customers and suppliers. Executives at firms large and small are 
coming to realize that they are competing not just with other firms but with those 
firms’ supply chains as well. Supply chain competition refers to the fact that in 
some industries firms are able to differentiate their product or pricing, and achieve a 
competitive advantage, due to superior supply chain management. Arguably, firms 
with superior supply chains can produce better products, more quickly, and at a lower 
cost than those with simply adequate supply chains (Antai, 2011).
	12.1	 AN OVERVIEW OF B2B E-COMMERCE
The trade between business firms represents a huge marketplace. The total amount 
of B2B trade in the United States in 2016 is expected to be about $14.5 trillion, with 
B2B e-commerce contributing about $6.7 trillion of that amount (U.S. Census Bureau,

TABLE 12.1	
MAJOR TRENDS IN B2B E-COMMERCE 2016–2017
B U S I N E S S
•	 B2B e-commerce growth continues to accelerate in 2016 to pre-recession levels as the U.S. 
economy continues to slowly recover from recession.
•	 B2B e-distributors adopt the same marketing and sales techniques as successful consumer 
e-commerce companies such as Amazon.
•	 Resurgence in Net marketplaces bringing together hundreds of suppliers and thousands of buying 
firms.
•	 Risk management: companies heighten their focus on risks in supply chains after being blindsided 
in recent years by a number of natural and man-made disasters. 
•	 Regional manufacturing: risks of far-flung global networks lead to an increase in regional 
manufacturing and supply chains, moving production closer to market demand. 
•	 Flexibility: growing emphasis on rapid-response and adaptive supply chains rather than lowest 
cost supply chains, which typically carry great risks.
•	 Supply chain visibility: growing calls for more real-time data that would allow managers to see 
not only across their production, but also into the production and financial condition of their key 
suppliers. 
•	 Social and mobile commerce and customer intimacy: B2B buyers, like consumers, are tapping into 
tablets, smartphones, and social networks for purchasing, scheduling, exception handling, and 
coordinating with their suppliers in order to manage supply chain risk.
T E C H N O L O G Y
•	 Big data: global trade and logistics systems are generating huge repositories of B2B data, 
swamping management understanding and controls.
•	 Business analytics: growing emphasis on use of business analytics software (business intelligence) 
to understand very large data sets.
•	 Cloud: migration of B2B hardware and software to cloud computing and cloud apps, away from 
individual corporate data centers, as a means of slowing rising technology costs. B2B systems 
move to cloud computing providers like IBM, Oracle, Amazon, Google, and HP as their core 
technology. 
•	 Mobile platform: growing use of mobile platform for B2B systems (CRM, SCM, and enterprise), 
putting B2B commerce into managers’ palms.
•	 Social networks: increasing use of social network platforms for feedback from customers, 
strengthening customer and supplier relationships, adjusting prices and orders, and enhancing 
decision making.
•	 Internet of Things: The number of Internet-connected sensors and other intelligent devices that 
measure and monitor data continues to grow exponentially and begins to impact how supply 
chains operate.
•	 Predictive analytics tools are increasingly being used to identify the most profitable customers.
S O C I E T Y
•	 Accountability: growing demands for supply chain accountability and monitoring in developed 
countries driven by reports of poor working conditions in Asian factories. 
•	 Sustainable supply chains: growing public demand for businesses to mitigate their environmental 
impact leads from local environmental optimization to consideration of the entire supply chain 
from design, production, customer service, and post-use disposal. 
•	 Acceptance and growth of B2B platforms: SAP Ariba, one of the largest Net marketplaces, has 
over 2 million connected businesses, including two-thirds of the Forbes Global 2000 largest 
companies, that participate in transactions with a value of over $800 billion a year.

2016; authors’ estimates). By 2020, B2B e-commerce is expected to grow to about $9 
trillion in the United States.
The process of conducting trade among business firms is complex and requires 
significant human intervention, and therefore, consumes significant resources. Some 
firms estimate that each corporate purchase order for support products costs them, 
on average, at least $100 in administrative overhead. Analysts estimate that the cost of 
a single manual order entry is about $10.50 when handled by a sales rep on the tele-
phone. A digital order cost is estimated to be 25 to 50 cents. Administrative overhead 
includes processing paper, approving purchase decisions, spending time using the 
telephone and fax machines to search for products and arrange for purchases, arrang-
ing for shipping, and receiving the goods. Across the economy, this adds up to trillions 
of dollars annually being spent for procurement processes that could potentially be 
automated. If even just a portion of inter-firm trade were automated, and parts of the 
entire procurement and sales process assisted by the Internet, then literally trillions 
of dollars might be released for more productive uses, consumer prices potentially 
would fall, productivity would increase, and the economic wealth of the nation would 
expand. This is the promise of B2B e-commerce. The challenge of B2B e-commerce 
is changing existing patterns and systems of procurement on the supply chain side, 
and designing and implementing new marketing and distribution systems on the B2B 
sell side. 
SOME BASIC DEFINITIONS
Before the Internet, business-to-business transactions were referred to simply as inter-
firm trade or the procurement process. We use the term B2B commerce to describe all 
types of inter-firm trade to exchange value across organizational boundaries, involving 
both the purchase of inputs and the distribution of products and services. B2B com-
merce includes the following business processes: customer relationship management, 
demand management, order fulfillment, manufacturing management, procurement, 
product development, returns, logistics/transportation, and inventory management 
(Barlow, 2011). This definition of B2B commerce does not include transactions that 
occur within the boundaries of a single firm—for instance, the transfer of goods and 
value from one subsidiary to another, or the use of corporate intranets to manage the 
firm. We use the term B2B e-commerce (or B2B digital commerce) to describe 
specifically that portion of B2B commerce that is enabled by the Internet (including 
mobile apps) (Fauska et al., 2013). The links that connect business firms in the produc-
tion of goods and services are referred to as the supply chain. Supply chains are a 
complex system of organizations, people, business processes, technology, and informa-
tion, all of which need to work together to produce products efficiently. Today’s supply 
chains are often global, connecting the smartphones in New York to the shipyards in 
Los Angeles and  Qingdao, and to the Foxconn factories that produce the phones. They 
are also local and national in scope. 
THE EVOLUTION OF B2B E-COMMERCE
B2B e-commerce has evolved over a 35-year period through several technology-driven 
stages (see Figure 12.1). The first step in the development of B2B e-commerce in the

mid-1970s was automated order entry systems that involved the use of telephone 
modems to send digital orders to health care products companies such as Baxter 
Healthcare. Baxter, a diversified supplier of hospital supplies, placed telephone 
modems in its customers’ procurement offices to automate reordering from Baxter’s 
computerized inventory database (and to discourage reordering from competitors). 
This early technology was replaced by personal computers using private networks in 
the late 1980s, and by Internet workstations accessing electronic online catalogs in 
the late 1990s. Automated order entry systems are seller-side solutions. They are 
owned by the suppliers and are seller-biased markets—they show only goods from a 
single seller. Customers benefited from these systems because they reduced the costs 
of inventory replenishment and were paid for largely by the suppliers. Automated 
order entry systems continue to play an important role in B2B commerce.
By the late 1970s, a new form of computer-to-computer communication called 
electronic data interchange (EDI) emerged. We describe EDI in greater detail later 
in this chapter, but at this point, it is necessary only to know that EDI is a communica-
tions standard for sharing business documents such as invoices, purchase orders, 
shipping bills, product stocking numbers (SKUs), and settlement information among 
a small number of firms. Virtually all large firms have EDI systems, and most industry 
groups have industry standards for defining documents in that industry. EDI systems

	 FIGURE 12.1	
THE EVOLUTION OF THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS 
IN B2B E-COMMERCE
B2B e-commerce has gone through many stages of development since the 1970s. Each stage reflects a 
major change in technology platforms from mainframes to private dedicated networks, and finally to the 
Internet, mobile apps, and social networks.

are owned by the buyers, hence they are buyer-side solutions and buyer-biased 
because they aim to reduce the procurement costs of supplies for the buyer. Of course, 
by automating the transaction, EDI systems also benefit the sellers through customer 
cost reduction. The topology of EDI systems is often referred to as a hub-and-spoke 
system, with the buyers in the center and the suppliers connected to the central hub 
via private dedicated networks.
EDI systems generally serve vertical markets. A vertical market is one that 
provides expertise and products for a specific industry, such as automobiles. In con-
trast, horizontal markets serve many different industries.
B2B e-commerce websites emerged in the mid-1990s along with the commercial-
ization of the Internet. B2B e-commerce websites are perhaps the simplest and 
easiest form of B2B e-commerce to understand, because they are just online catalogs 
of products made available to the public marketplace by a single supplier. In this sense, 
they mimic the functionality of B2C e-commerce websites. Owned by the supplier, 
they are seller-side solutions and seller-biased because they show only the products 
offered by a single supplier.
B2B e-commerce websites are a natural descendant of automated order entry 
systems, but there are two important differences: (1) the far less expensive and more 
universal Internet becomes the communication media and displaces private net-
works, and (2) B2B e-commerce websites tend to serve horizontal markets—they carry 
products that serve a wide variety of industries. Although B2B e-commerce websites 
emerged prior to Net marketplaces (described next), they are usually considered a 
type of Net marketplace. Today, more and more B2B manufacturers, distributors, and 
suppliers are using B2B e-commerce websites to sell directly to business customers, 
who most often are procurement/purchasing agents, as discussed in Section 12.2.
Net marketplaces emerged in the late 1990s as a natural extension and scaling-up 
of B2B e-commerce websites. There are many different kinds of Net marketplaces, 
which we describe in detail in Section 12.4, but the essential characteristic of a Net 
marketplace is that it brings hundreds or even thousands of suppliers—each with a 
digital catalog and potentially thousands of purchasing firms—into a single Internet-
based environment to conduct trade. We also use the term Net marketplace to refer 
to Internet-enabled marketing, distribution, and sales systems.
Private industrial networks also emerged in the last decade as natural extensions 
of EDI systems and the existing close relationships that developed between large 
industrial firms and their trusted suppliers. Described in more detail in Section 12.5, 
private industrial networks (sometimes also referred to as a private trading exchange, 
or PTX) are Internet-based communication environments that extend far beyond 
procurement to encompass supply chain efficiency enhancements and truly collabora-
tive commerce where the buyers work with the sellers to develop and design new 
products. 
THE GROWTH OF B2B E-COMMERCE
Figure 12.2 illustrates the growth of B2B e-commerce, as well as that of traditional 
B2B commerce, during the period 2011–2020. However, let’s focus on the growth of 
B2B e-commerce during the period 2016–2020. During this time, B2B e-commerce is

projected to grow from about $6.7 trillion in 2016 (about 46% of total B2B commerce in 
the United States) to $9 trillion (51% of total B2B commerce) in 2020. Several observa-
tions are important to note with respect to Figure 12.2. First, it shows that the initial 
belief that online marketplaces would become the dominant form of B2B e-commerce 
is not supported even though their growth rate has increased as firms like Amazon and 
eBay establish Net marketplaces. Second, private industrial networks play a dominant 
role in B2B e-commerce, both now and in the future. Third, non-EDI B2B e-commerce 
is the most rapidly growing type of B2B e-commerce. However, EDI remains quite 
common and continues to be a workhorse of B2B commerce even though its growth 
is expected to be relatively flat in the five four years. 
Not all industries will be similarly affected by B2B e-commerce, nor will all indus-
tries similarly benefit from B2B. Several factors influence the speed with which indus-
tries migrate to B2B e-commerce and the volume of transactions. Those industries 
in which there is already significant utilization of EDI (indicating concentration of 
buyers and suppliers) and large investments in information technology and Internet 
infrastructure can be expected to move first and fastest to B2B e-commerce utilization. 
The aerospace and defense, computer, and industrial equipment industries meet these 
criteria. Where the marketplace is highly concentrated on either the purchasing or 
selling side, or both, conditions are also ripe for rapid B2B e-commerce growth, as in 
	 FIGURE 12.2

Private industrial networks are the fastest growing form of B2B e-commerce, which includes EDI, B2B Net marketplaces, and private industrial 
markets.

the energy and chemical industries. In the case of health care, the federal govern-
ment, health care providers (doctors and hospitals), and major insurance companies 
are moving toward a national medical record system and the use of the Internet for 
managing medical payments. Coordinating the various players in the health care 
system is an extraordinary B2B challenge. Firms like IBM and Microsoft, and B2B 
service firms like SAP Ariba, are expanding the use of information ecosystems where 
health providers and insurers can share information. 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES OF B2B E-COMMERCE
Regardless of the specific type, B2B commerce as a whole promises many strategic 
benefits to firms—both buyers and sellers—and impressive gains for the economy. 
B2B e-commerce can:
•	 Lower administrative costs
•	 Lower search costs for buyers
•	 Reduce inventory costs by increasing competition among suppliers (increasing price 
transparency) and reducing inventory to the bare minimum
•	 Lower transaction costs by eliminating paperwork and automating parts of the 
procurement process
•	 Increase production flexibility by ensuring delivery of parts just at the right time 
(known as just-in-time production)
•	 Improve quality of products by increasing cooperation among buyers and sellers 
and reducing quality issues
•	 Decrease product cycle time by sharing designs and production schedules with 
suppliers
•	 Increase opportunities for collaborating with suppliers and distributors
•	 Create greater price transparency—the ability to see the actual buy and sell prices 
in a market
•	 Increase the visibility and real-time information sharing among all participants in 
the supply chain network.
B2B e-commerce offers potential first-mover strategic benefits for individual 
firms as well. Firms that move their procurement processes online first will experi-
ence impressive gains in productivity, cost reduction, and potentially much faster 
introduction of new, higher-quality products. While these gains may be imitated by 
other competing firms, it is also clear from the history of B2B e-commerce that firms 
making sustained investments in information technology and B2B e-commerce can 
adapt much faster to new technologies as they emerge, creating a string of first-mover 
advantages.
While there are many potential benefits to B2B e-commerce, there are also con-
siderable risks and challenges. Often real-world supply chains fail to provide visibility 
into the supply chain because they lack real-time demand, production, and logistics 
data, and have inadequate financial data on suppliers. The result is unexpected sup-
plier failure and disruption to the supply chain. Builders of B2B supply chains often 
had little concern for the environmental impacts of supply chains, the sensitivity of 
supply chains to natural events, fluctuating fuel and labor costs, or the impact of public

values involving labor and environmental policies. The result in 2016 is that many 
Fortune 1000 supply chains are risky, vulnerable, and socially and environmentally 
unsustainable. Read Insight on Society: Where’s My iPad? Apple’s Supply Chain Risks and 
Vulnerabilities for a look at the impact the Tohoku earthquake in Fukushima, Japan 
had on global supply chains, as well as the reputational risk posed by supply chains.
	12.2	 THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS AND SUPPLY CHAINS
The subject of B2B e-commerce can be complex because there are so many ways the 
Internet can be used to support the exchange of goods and payments among organiza-
tions, efficient supply chains, and collaboration. At the most basic level, B2B e-com-
merce is about changing the procurement process (how business firms purchase 
goods they need to produce goods they will ultimately sell to consumers) of thousands 
of firms across the United States and the world. In the procurement process, firms 
purchase goods from a set of suppliers, and they in turn purchase their inputs from a 
set of suppliers. The supply chain includes not just the firms themselves, but also the 
relationships among them and the processes that connect them.
STEPS IN THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS
There are seven separate steps in the procurement process (see Figure 12.3). The 
first three steps involve the decision of who to buy from and what to pay: searching 
for suppliers of specific products; qualifying both sellers and the products they sell; 
procurement process
how firms purchase goods 
they need to produce 
goods for consumers

The procurement process is a lengthy and complicated series of steps that involves the seller, buyer, and shipping companies in a series of 
connected transactions.

INSIGHT ON SOCIETY
WHERE’S MY IPAD? SUPPLY CHAIN RISK AND 
VULNERABILITY 
In March 2011, a magnitude 9.0 
earthquake occurred offshore of 
northern Japan. The Tohoku earth-
quake was the largest in recorded his-
tory and immediately created a number of 
tsunami waves, some of which exceeded 100 feet 
in height and penetrated up to six miles inland. In 
their path were six coastal nuclear reactors in the 
Fukushima Prefecture near the town of Okuma, 
the largest nuclear power site in the world. Sev-
eral of the nuclear reactors exploded and began 
leaking dangerous levels of radiation as fuel rods 
melted at temperatures exceeding 5,000 degrees. 
The Tohoku earthquake exposed significant 
weaknesses and vulnerabilities in today’s modern 
B2B supply chains. Technology, globalization of 
trade, and high levels of wage disparity between 
the developed and undeveloped worlds have led to 
a massive outsourcing of manufacturing around the 
world. Today, every component of every manufac-
tured product is carefully examined by company 
engineers and financial managers with an eye to 
finding the lowest cost and highest quality manu-
facturer. Production inevitably tends to concen-
trate at single firms that are given very high order 
volumes if they can meet the price. Large orders 
make lower prices easier to provide because of 
scale economies. However, when you concentrate 
production globally with just a few suppliers, you 
also concentrate risk. 
As a result, the world’s manufacturing base has 
become less redundant, flexible, and adaptive than 
older traditional supply chains. Interdependencies 
have grown into a tightly coupled machine that is 
quite fragile. Risk assessment in supply chains has 
been weak or nonexistent. 
Computers, cell phones, tractors, airplanes, 
and automobiles are just a few of the complex man-
ufactured goods that rely on parts and subassem-
blies made thousands of miles away from their final 
assembly plants. Most of these manufacturers know 
who their first-tier suppliers are but may be less 
aware about who supplies their suppliers, and so on 
down the line of the industrial spider’s web that con-
stitutes the real world of supply chains. Few firms 
had considered the impact of an earthquake on 
their supply chains, or a nuclear meltdown, or even 
a financial collapse in the global banking system—
all typical risks found in the real world. 
Take the Apple iPad. In a teardown of an 
iPad after the earthquake, IHS iSuppli, a market 
research firm, identified at least five major com-
ponents sourced from Japanese suppliers, some 
of whom were located in northern Japan. Not all 
of these suppliers were directly impacted by the 
earthquake, but some were, and many had sub-
suppliers of various hard-to-replace small compo-
nents that were directly impacted. For instance, 
the iPad and iPhone’s unusually shaped lithium 
batteries used a crucial polymer made by Kureha, 
a Japanese firm in the nuclear contamination 
zone. Kureha controls 70% of the global produc-
tion of this polymer. Apple was not the only con-
sumer product manufacturer hit hard: computer 
chips are built on silicon wafers, and 25% of the 
world’s supply is made by two Japanese manufac-
turers, both of which had to shut down wafer pro-
duction. A few years later, in 2015, a tear-down 
of the iPhone 6 Plus by IHS iSuppli found that 
Apple had learned its lesson and diversified its 
supply chain by often having two manufacturers 
for the same components sourced from different 
countries, and also having various components 
manufactured in different parts of the globe. For 
instance, the retina display screen is manufactured 
in both Japan and Korea, while the A8 processor is

manufactured in both Taiwan and Korea; the 
NFC chips are made in Holland and Austria, 
while the audio chip is from United States and 
the accelerometer chip is from Germany.
Apple was not the only manufacturer that 
learned a lesson in supply chain risk from the Japa-
nese earthquake: Boeing was without carbon fiber 
airframe assemblies made in Japan; Ford and GM 
closed factories for lack of Japanese transmissions; 
and Caterpillar reduced production at its factories 
worldwide as it attempted to secure alternative 
suppliers. 
Supply chain risk involves more than disrup-
tions in production, as Apple and many other com-
panies have discovered. Supply chains can produce 
reputational risks when key suppliers engage in 
labor and environmental policies and practices 
that are unacceptable to developed world audi-
ences. For instance, for much of 2012, Apple was 
under attack in the United States and Europe after 
an audit by the Fair Labor Association found that 
workers at several assembly plants operated by 
Apple contractor Foxconn were exposed to toxic 
chemicals and forced to work over 60 hours a week 
under dangerous work conditions. 
Also in 2012, a fire in a clothing factory in 
Dhaka, Bangladesh, killed 117 workers, mostly 
women and children. Well-known brands from 
Europe and the United States, among them 
Walmart and Spanish giant Inditex, were produc-
ing clothing in this factory. Walmart claimed a sub-
contractor was using this factory without Walmart’s 
knowledge. The fire created a worldwide protest, 
and has led to government and industry efforts to 
certify factory safety in Bangladesh and hold firms 
responsible for working conditions. 
It also isn’t just natural disasters and fires 
that can disrupt supply lines. In 2015, supply lines 
from Asia to the United States were shut down for 
nearly a month by a longshoreman’s dock strike 
that resulted in a slowdown of automobile pro-
duction throughout the United States. This in turn 
backed up production in Asia of car parts. Thailand, 
the world’s third largest fish exporter, was discov-
ered to be using slave labor to harvest fish, and its 
product was banned by the European Union. Many 
American companies had their supplies disrupted, 
and needed to find other suppliers. Finally a new 
class of supply chain risk is becoming apparent: 
cybersecurity risks. With hundreds of suppliers, it is 
very difficult for any single purchasing firm to assess 
the security of its suppliers’ systems. Reducing the 
number of suppliers is one method. Working only 
with trusted partners is another. Yet there remains a 
large opportunity for cybercriminals and rogue gov-
ernments to disrupt global supply chains.
One might think that in the so-called global and 
Internet economy, computer-based supply chains 
could quickly and effortlessly adjust to find new 
suppliers for just about any component or indus-
trial material in a matter of minutes. Think again. 
New supply chains will need to be built that opti-
mize not just cost but also survivability in the event 
of disasters, as well as meet the ethical demands of 
the major consuming countries in Europe and the 
United States.

and negotiating prices, credit terms, escrow requirements, quality, and scheduling of 
delivery. Once a supplier is identified, purchase orders are issued, the buyer is sent 
an invoice, the goods are shipped, and the buyer sends a payment. Each of these steps 
in the procurement process is composed of many separate business processes and 
subactivities. Each of these activities must be recorded in the information systems of 
the seller, buyer, and shipper. Often, this data entry is not automatic and involves a 
great deal of manual labor, telephone calls, faxes, and e-mails.
TYPES OF PROCUREMENT
Two distinctions are important for understanding how B2B e-commerce can improve 
the procurement process. First, firms make purchases of two kinds of goods from 
suppliers: direct goods and indirect goods. Direct goods are goods integrally involved 
in the production process; for instance, when an automobile manufacturer purchases 
sheet steel for auto body production. Indirect goods are all other goods not directly 
involved in the production process, such as office supplies and maintenance products. 
Often these goods are called MRO goods—products for maintenance, repair, and 
operations.
Second, firms use two different methods for purchasing goods: contract purchas-
ing and spot purchasing. Contract purchasing involves long-term written agreements 
to purchase specified products, with agreed-upon terms and quality, for an extended 
period of time. Generally, firms purchase direct goods using long-term contracts. Spot 
purchasing involves the purchase of goods based on immediate needs in larger 
marketplaces that involve many suppliers. Generally, firms use spot purchasing for 
indirect goods, although in some cases, firms also use spot purchasing for direct goods.
According to some estimates, about 65% of inter-firm trade involves contract 
purchasing of direct goods, and 35% involves spot purchasing of indirect goods (Ariba, 
2014; Kaplan and Sawhney, 2000). There are, of course, differences among industries. 
Purchases of direct goods play a dominant role in the extraction and metal industries, 
for instance. This finding is significant for understanding B2B e-commerce.
Although the procurement process involves the purchasing of goods, it is extraor-
dinarily information-intense, involving the movement of information among many 
existing corporate systems. The procurement process today is also very labor-inten-
sive, directly involving over 1 million employees in the United States, not including 
those engaged in transportation, finance, insurance, or general office administration 
related to the process. The key players in the procurement process are the purchasing 
managers. They ultimately decide who to buy from, what to buy, and on what terms. 
Purchasing managers (“procurement managers” in the business press) are also the 
key decision makers for the adoption of B2B e-commerce solutions. As purchasing 
managers have become more familiar and comfortable with B2C e-commerce in their 
personal lives, they are increasingly coming to expect the same type of purchasing 
experience in the B2B arena. As a result, B2B manufacturers, suppliers, and distribu-
tors are finding that in order to effectively compete, they must pay more attention 
to the online customer experience, just as their B2C counterparts do. Features that 
B2B customers now expect include enhanced search functionality, up-to-date product 
pricing and availability information, product configurators, mobile support, apps along

with websites, online support forums, live customer service reps, and a database that 
contains their corporate purchasing history, shipping preferences, and payment data, 
and provides support for repeat orders. 
MULTI-TIER SUPPLY CHAINS
Although Figure 12.3 captures some of the complexity of the procurement process, it 
is important to realize that firms purchase thousands of goods from ­thousands of 
suppliers. The suppliers, in turn, must purchase their inputs from their suppliers. 
Large manufacturers such as Ford Motor Company have over 20,000 ­suppliers of parts, 
packaging, and technology. The number of secondary and tertiary suppliers is at least 
as large. Together, this extended multi-tier supply chain (the chain of primary, 
secondary, and tertiary suppliers) constitutes a crucial aspect of the industrial infra-
structure of the economy. Figure 12.4 depicts a firm’s multi-tier supply chain.
The supply chain depicted in Figure 12.4 is a three-tier chain simplified for the 
sake of illustration. In fact, large Fortune 1000 firms have thousands of suppliers, who 
in turn have thousands of smaller suppliers. The real-world supply chain is often many 
layers deep. The complexity of the supply chain suggests a combinatorial explosion. 
Assuming a manufacturer has four primary suppliers and each one has three primary 
suppliers, and each of these has three primary suppliers, then the total number of 
suppliers in the chain (including the buying firm) rises to 53. This figure does not 
include the shippers, insurers, and financiers involved in the transactions.
Immediately, you can see from Figure 12.4 that the procurement process involves 
a very large number of suppliers, each of whom must be coordinated with the 
multi-tier supply 
chain

secondary, and tertiary 
suppliers

production needs of the ultimate purchaser—the buying firm. You can also understand 
how difficult it is to manage the supply chain, or obtain visibility into the supply chain 
simply because of its size and scope. 
VISIBILITY AND OTHER CONCEPTS IN SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 
The global, multi-tier nature of supply chains produces a number of challenges for 
supply chain managers. A central concept of supply chains is supply chain visibility, 
which refers to the ability of a firm to monitor the output and pricing of its first- and 
second-tier suppliers, track and manage supplier orders, and manage transportation 
and logistics providers who are moving the products. A supply chain is visible when 
you know exactly what you have ordered from your suppliers and what their produc-
tion schedule is, and when you can track the goods through shipping and trucking 
firms to your in-bound warehouse. With this knowledge, the firm’s internal enterprise 
systems can produce production schedules and develop financial forecasts (Long, 2014; 
Cecere, 2014; Cecere, 2013). Generally, the more firms invest in digitally enabled 
supply chains, the greater the visibility managers have into the process (Caridia, et. 
al., 2010).
Other key concepts in supply chain management, and which are also central 
management challenges, are described in Table 12.2.
THE ROLE OF EXISTING LEGACY COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND ENTERPRISE 
SYSTEMS IN SUPPLY CHAINS
Complicating any efforts to coordinate the many firms in a supply chain is the fact 
that each firm generally has its own set of legacy computer systems, sometimes home-
grown or customized, that cannot easily pass information to other systems. Legacy 
computer systems generally are older enterprise systems used to manage key busi-
ness processes within a firm in a variety of functional areas from manufacturing, 
logistics, finance, and human resources. Enterprise systems are corporate-wide 
systems that relate to all aspects of production, including finance, human resources, 
and procurement. Many large Fortune 500 global firms have implemented global 
enterprise-wide systems from major vendors such as IBM, SAP, Oracle, and others. 
Generally enterprise systems have an inward focus on the firm’s internal production

processes, and only tangentially are concerned with suppliers. More contemporary 
cloud-based dedicated B2B software that can be integrated with existing enterprise 
systems is growing in importance. Companies such as IBM, Oracle, and SAP have 
developed SaaS (software as a service) or on-demand cloud-based supply chain man-
agement systems that can work seamlessly with their legacy offerings. Cloud-based 
supply chain management revenues are growing at 25% annually, although many 
firms prefer to maintain their own supply chain management systems on their private 
clouds rather than use shared public cloud services (Chao, 2015; Accenture, 2014). 
	12.3	 TRENDS IN SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT AND 
COLLABORATIVE COMMERCE
It is impossible to comprehend the actual and potential contribution of B2B e-com-
merce, or the successes and failures of B2B e-commerce vendors and markets, without 
understanding ongoing efforts to improve the procurement process through a variety 
of supply chain management programs that long preceded the development of 
e-commerce.
Supply chain management (SCM) refers to a wide variety of activities that 
firms and industries use to coordinate the key players in their procurement process. 
For the most part, today’s procurement managers still work with telephones, e-mail, 
fax machines, face-to-face conversations, and instinct, relying on trusted long-term 
suppliers for their strategic purchases of goods directly involved in the production 
process.
There have been a number of major developments in supply chain manage-
ment over the last two decades that set the ground rules for understanding how B2B 
e-commerce works (or fails to work). These developments include just-in-time and 
lean production, supply chain simplification, adaptive supply chains, sustainable 
supply chains, electronic data interchange (EDI), supply chain management systems, 
and collaborative commerce.
JUST-IN-TIME AND LEAN PRODUCTION
One of the significant costs in any production process is the cost of in-process inven-
tory: the parts and supplies needed to produce a product or service. Just-in-time 
production is a method of inventory cost management that seeks to reduce excess 
inventory to a bare minimum. In just-in-time production, the parts needed for, say, 
an automobile, arrive at the assembly factory a few hours or even minutes before they 
are attached to a car. Payment for the parts does not occur until the parts are attached 
to a vehicle on the production line. In the past, producers used to order enough parts 
for a week or even a month’s worth of production, creating huge, costly buffers in the 
production process. These buffers assured that parts would almost always be available, 
but at a large cost. Lean production is a set of production methods and tools that 
focuses on the elimination of waste throughout the customer value chain. It is an 
extension of just-in-time beyond inventory management to the full range of activities 
that create customer value. Originally, just-in-time and lean methods were  implemented

with phones, faxes, and paper documents to coordinate the flow of parts in inventory. 
Supply chain management systems now have largely automated the process of acquir-
ing inventory from suppliers, and made possible significant savings on a global basis. 
Arguably, contemporary supply chain systems are the foundation of today’s global 
B2B production system.
SUPPLY CHAIN SIMPLIFICATION
Many manufacturing firms have spent the past two decades reducing the size of their 
supply chains and working more closely with a smaller group of strategic supplier 
firms to reduce both product costs and administrative costs, while improving quality, 
a trend known as supply chain simplification. Following the lead of Japanese 
industry, for instance, the automobile industry has systematically reduced the number 
of its suppliers by over 50%. Instead of open bidding for orders, large manufacturers 
have chosen to work with strategic partner supply firms under long-term contracts 
that guarantee the supplier business and also establish quality, cost, and timing goals. 
These strategic partnership programs are essential for just-in-time production models, 
and often involve joint product development and design, integration of computer 
systems, and tight coupling of the production processes of two or more companies. 
Tight coupling is a method for ensuring that suppliers precisely deliver the ordered 
parts at a specific time and to a particular location, ensuring the production process 
is not interrupted for lack of parts.
SUPPLY CHAIN BLACK SWANS: ADAPTIVE SUPPLY CHAINS
While firms have greatly simplified their supply chains in the last decade, they have 
also sought to centralize them by adopting a single, global supply chain system that 
integrates all the firm’s vendor and logistics information into a single enterprise-wide 
system. Large software firms such as Oracle, IBM, and SAP encourage firms to adopt 
a “one world, one firm, one database” enterprise-wide view of the world in order to 
achieve scale economies, simplicity, and to optimize global cost and value. 
Beginning in earnest in 2000, managers in developed countries used these new 
technological capabilities to push manufacturing and production to the lowest cost 
labor regions of the world, specifically China and South East Asia. This movement of 
production to Asia was also enabled by the entrance of China into the World Trade 
Organization in September 2001. Suddenly, it was both technologically and politically 
possible to concentrate production wherever possible in the lowest cost region of the 
world. These developments were also supported by low-cost fuel, which made both 
transoceanic shipping and production inexpensive, and relative political stability in the 
region. By 2005, many economists believed a new world economic order had emerged 
based on cheap labor in Asia capable of producing inexpensive products for Western 
consumers, profits for global firms, and the opening of Asian markets to sophisticated 
Western goods and financial products. 
As it turns out, there were many risks and costs to this strategy of concentrating 
production in a world of economic, financial, political, and even geological instability. 
Today, managers need to be more careful in balancing gains in efficiency from a highly 
centralized supply chain, with the risks inherent to such a strategy (Long, 2014). For 
supply chain 
simplification 
involves reducing the size 
of the supply chain and 
working more closely with 
a smaller group of strategic 
supplier firms to reduce 
both product costs and 
administrative costs, while 
improving quality

suppliers precisely deliver

instance, in the global financial crisis of 2007–2009, relying on suppliers in parts of 
Europe where currencies and interest rates fluctuated greatly exposed many firms to 
higher costs than anticipated. Suddenly, key suppliers could not obtain financing for 
their production or shipments. In 2016, the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the Euro-
pean Union (commonly referred to as Brexit) is expected to rattle European supply 
chains. And as you learned in the Insight on Society case, the 2011 earthquake and 
tsunami in Japan had a significant impact on supply chains in a number of industries 
around the world. In February 2016, another earthquake, this time in southern Taiwan, 
had a similar impact. Taiwan is the global manufacturing center of integrated circuit 
wafers, accounting for 70% of the world’s production of processor chips used by Apple, 
IBM, Microsoft, and hundreds of other firms (Resilinc, 2016; DHL, 2016). In recent 
years, the source of supply chain disruptions has shifted to technology, with major 
disruptions due to failure of cloud-based services and cyberattacks (Resilinc, 2016; 
Rossi, 2015; Rowland, 2014; Gusman, 2013; Zurich Insurance, 2012).
The risks and costs of extended and concentrated supply chains have begun to 
change corporate strategies (Chopra and Sodhi, 2014). To cope with unpredictable 
world events, firms are taking steps to create adaptive supply chains that allow them 
to react to disruptions in the supply chain in a particular region by moving production 
to a different region. Many companies are breaking up single global supply chain 
systems into regional or product-based supply chains and reducing the level of cen-
tralization. Using adaptive supply chains, firms can decide to locate some production 
of parts in Latin America, for instance, rather than having all their production or 
suppliers in a single country such as Japan or China. They will be able to move produc-
tion around the world to temporary safe harbors. This may result in higher short-term 
costs, but provide substantial, longer-term risk protection in the event any single 
region is disrupted. Increasingly, supply chains are being built based on the assump-
tion that global ­disruptions in supply are inevitable, but not predictable. The focus in 
2015 is on optimal-cost, not low-cost, supply chains, and more distributed manufactur-
ing along with more flexible supply chains that can shift reliably from high-risk to 
low-risk areas. Regional manufacturing means shorter supply chains that can respond 
rapidly to changing consumer tastes and demand levels (PriceWaterhouseCoopers and 
the MIT Forum for Supply Chain Innovation, 2015; Cachon and Swinney, 2011). 
ACCOUNTABLE SUPPLY CHAINS: LABOR STANDARDS
Accountable supply chains are those where the labor conditions in low-wage, under-
developed producer countries are visible and morally acceptable to ultimate consum-
ers in more developed industrial societies. For much of the last century, American 
and European manufacturers with global supply chains with large offshore production 
facilities sought to hide the realities of their offshore factories from Western reporters 
and ordinary citizens. For global firms with long supply chains, visibility did not mean 
their consumers could understand how their products were made. 
Beginning in 2000, and in part because of the growing power of the Internet to 
empower citizen reporters around the world, the realities of global supply chains have 
slowly become more transparent to the public. For instance, for much of the past 
adaptive supply chain

to disruptions in the supply

decade, beginning in 1997, Nike, the world’s largest manufacturer of sporting goods, 
has been under intense criticism for exploiting foreign workers, operating sweat 
shops, employing children, and allowing dangerous conditions in its subcontractor 
factories. As a result, Nike has introduced significant changes to its global supply 
chain. Bangladesh is a continuing source of apparel factory fires beginning with 
the Dhakka fire of 2010, the Rena Plaza factory building collapse of 2013, and the 
second Dhakka fire in 2015, all of which resulted in deaths and injuries to workers. 
Around 80% of Bangladesh’s exports (and 60% of its total GDP) come from apparel 
manufacturing for global brands such as Walmart, H&M, JCPenney, Zara, and others 
(Manik and Yardley, 2013).
With the emergence of truly global supply chains, and political changes at the 
World Trade Organization, which opened up European and American markets to Asian 
goods and services, many—if not most—of the electronics, toys, cosmetics, industrial 
supplies, footwear, apparel, and other goods consumed in the developed world are 
made by workers in factories in the less developed world, primarily in Asia and Latin 
America. Unfortunately, but quite understandably, the labor conditions in these fac-
tories in most cases do not meet the minimal labor standards of Europe or America 
even though these factories pay higher wages and offer better working conditions than 
other local jobs in the host country. In many cases, the cost for a worker of not having 
a job in what—to Western standards—are horrible working conditions is to sink deeper 
into poverty and even worse conditions. Many point out that labor conditions were 
brutal in the United States and Europe in the nineteenth and early twentieth century 
when these countries were building industrial economies, and therefore, whatever 
conditions exist in offshore factories in 2016 are no worse than developed countries 
in their early years of rapid industrialization. 
The argument results in a painful ethical dilemma, a terrible trade-off: cheap 
manufactured goods that increase consumer welfare in developed countries seem to 
require human misery in less developed countries. Indeed, these jobs would never 
have been moved to less developed parts of world without exceptionally low, even 
survival level, wages. 
Notwithstanding the argument that having a job is better than being unemployed 
in low-wage countries, or any country, there are some working conditions that are 
completely unacceptable to consumers and therefore to firms in developed countries. 
Among these unacceptable working conditions are slave or forced labor, child employ-
ment, routine exposure to toxic substances, more than 48 hours of work per week, 
harassment and abuse, sexual exploitation, and compensation beneath the minimal 
standard of living leaving no disposable income. These practices were, and are, in some 
cases typical, and certainly not atypical, in many low-wage countries. 
A number of groups in the last decade have contributed to efforts to make global 
supply chains transparent to reporters and citizens, and to develop minimal standards 
of accountability. Among these groups are the National Consumers League, Human 
Rights First, the Maquila Solidarity Network, the Global Fairness Initiative, the Clean 
Clothes Campaign, the International Labor Organization (UN), and the Fair Labor 
Association (FLA). The FLA is a coalition of business firms with offshore production

and global supply chains, universities, and private organizations. For member firms, 
the FLA conducts interviews with workers, makes unannounced visits to factories to 
track progress, and investigates complaints. They are also one of the major interna-
tional labor standard-setting organizations (Fair Labor Association, 2012).
 In March 2012, the FLA released its investigation of Hon Hai Precision Industry 
Company (a Taiwan-based company known as Foxconn), which is the assembler of 
nearly all iPhones and iPads in the world. Foxconn operates what is alleged to be 
the largest factory in the world in Longhua, Shenzhen, where over 250,000 workers 
assemble electronics goods. The audit of working conditions at Foxconn was authorized 
by Apple, a member of the FLA, and was based on 35,000 surveys of workers at the 
Longhua factory. The report found over 50 legal and code violations (sometimes in 
violation of Chinese laws) including requiring too many hours of work a week (over 
60), failing to pay workers for overtime, and hazardous conditions that injured workers 
(Fair Labor Association, 2012). Similar violations of labor standards continue to be 
found in the Middle East and Asia (Fair Labor Association, 2015).
SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAINS: LEAN, MEAN, AND GREEN
Sustainable business is a call for business to take social and ecological interests, and 
not just corporate profits, into account in all their decision-making throughout the 
firm (UN Global Compact Office and BSR, 2015). No small request. Since the United 
Nations World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) published the 
first comprehensive report on sustainable business in 1987, firms around the globe 
have struggled with these concepts and in some cases ignored or resisted them as 
simply a threat to sustained profitability. The commission’s report (Our Common 
Future) argued for a balance of profits, social ­community development, and minimal 
impact on the world environment, including, of course, the carbon footprint of busi-
ness. Today, the consensus among major firms in Europe, Asia, and the United States 
has become that in the long term, and through careful planning, sustainable business 
and sustainable supply chains are just good business because it means using the 
most efficient environment-regarding means of production, distribution, and logistics. 
These efficient methods create value for consumers, investors, and communities 
(Suering and Muller, 2008).
Notions of sustainable business have had a powerful impact on supply chain 
thinking. In part, these efforts are good risk management: all advanced countries have 
substantially strengthened their environmental regulations. It makes good business 
sense for firms to prepare methods and operations suitable to this new environment.
For instance, all the major textiles brands and retailers have announced plans for 
a more sustainable supply chain in textiles. One of the world’s truly ancient industries, 
textiles supports millions of workers while consuming extraordinary resources: it takes 
1,000 gallons of water to make one pound of finished cotton (your jeans, for instance). 
While growing cotton has its issues (fertilizer), the subsequent dying, finishing, and 
cleaning of cotton makes it the number one industrial polluter on Earth. It’s not a 
small matter then that Walmart, Gap, Levi’s, Nike, and other large players in the 
industry are taking steps to reduce the environmental impact of their operations by 
improving the efficiency of the entire supply and distribution chains.

With the help of IBM, SAP, and Oracle, other firms and entire industries are 
working to develop sustainable supply chains (IKEA, 2016). McKesson, North Ameri-
ca’s largest distributor of drugs, uses IBM’s Supply Chain Sustainability Management 
Solution (SCSM) to minimize carbon dioxide emissions throughout its supply chain, 
while lowering its distribution costs. SCSM (a business analytics package that works 
with IBM’s B2B software) can determine low-cost refrigeration alternatives for certain 
medicines (such as insulin and vaccines), identify the environmentally least harmful 
way to bring new products into its distribution network, and determine the best way 
to transport pharmaceuticals to customers.
ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE (EDI)
As noted in the previous section, B2B e-commerce did not originate with the Internet, 
but in fact has its roots in technologies such as EDI that were first developed in the 
mid-1970s and 1980s. EDI is a broadly defined communications protocol for exchanging 
documents among computers using technical standards developed by the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI X12 standards) and international bodies such as 
the United Nations (EDIFACT standards).
EDI was developed to reduce the cost, delays, and errors inherent in the manual 
exchanges of documents such as purchase orders, shipping documents, price lists, 
payments, and customer data. EDI differs from an unstructured message because 
its messages are organized with distinct fields for each of the important pieces of 
information in a commercial transaction such as transaction date, product purchased, 
amount, sender’s name, address, and recipient’s name.
Each major industry in the United States and throughout much of the industrial 
world has EDI industry committees that define the structure and information fields of 
electronic documents for that industry. Estimates indicate that B2B e-commerce EDI 
transactions will total about $3.2 trillion in 2016, about 48% of all B2B e-commerce 
(U.S. Census Bureau, 2016; authors’ estimates). In this sense, EDI remains very impor-
tant in the development of B2B e-commerce (Cecere, 2014). 
EDI has evolved significantly since the 1980s (see Figure 12.5). Initially, EDI 
focused on document automation (Stage 1). Procurement agents created purchase 
orders electronically and sent them to trading partners, who in turn shipped order 
fulfillment and shipping notices electronically back to the purchaser. Invoices, pay-
ments, and other documents followed. These early implementations replaced the 
postal system for document transmission, and resulted in same-day shipping of orders 
(rather than a week’s delay caused by the postal system), reduced errors, and lower 
costs. The second stage of EDI development began in the early 1990s, driven largely 
by the automation of internal industrial processes and movement toward just-in-time 
production and continuous production. New methods of production called for greater 
flexibility in scheduling, shipping, and financing of supplies. EDI evolved to become 
a tool for continuous inventory replenishment. EDI was used to eliminate purchase 
orders and other documents entirely, replacing them with production schedules 
and inventory balances. Supplier firms were sent monthly statements of production 
requirements and precise scheduled delivery times, and the orders would be fulfilled 
continuously, with inventory and payments being adjusted at the end of each month.

In the third stage of EDI, beginning in the mid-1990s, suppliers were given online 
access to selected parts of the purchasing firm’s production and delivery schedules, 
and, under long-term contracts, were required to meet those schedules on their own 
without intervention by firm purchasing agents. Movement toward this continuous 
real-time access model of EDI was spurred in the 1990s by large manufacturing and 
process firms (such as oil and chemical companies) that were implementing enterprise 
systems. These systems required standardization of business processes and resulted 
in the automation of production, logistics, and many financial processes. These new 
processes required much closer relationships with suppliers and logistics partners 
(shipping and ground transporters), who were required to be more precise in delivery 
scheduling and more flexible in inventory management. This level of supplier preci-
sion could never be achieved economically by human purchasing agents. This third 
stage of EDI enabled the era of continuous replenishment. For instance, Walmart 
and Toys“R”Us provide their suppliers with access to their store inventories, and the 
	 FIGURE 12.5	
THE EVOLUTION OF EDI AS A B2B MEDIUM
EDI has evolved from a simple point-to-point digital communications medium to a many-to-one enabling 
tool for continuous inventory replenishment.

suppliers are expected to keep the stock of items on the shelf within prespecified 
targets. Similar developments occurred in the grocery industry. 
Today, EDI must be viewed as a general enabling technology that provides for the 
exchange of critical business information between computer applications supporting a 
wide variety of business processes. EDI is an important industrial network technology, 
suited to support communications among a small set of strategic partners in direct, long-
term trading relationships. The technical platform of EDI has changed from mainframes 
to personal computers, from corporate data centers to cloud-based software-as-a-service 
(SaaS) platforms (described below). EDI is not well suited for the development of Net 
marketplaces, where thousands of suppliers and purchasers meet in a digital arena to 
negotiate prices. EDI supports direct bilateral communications among a small set of 
firms and does not permit the multilateral, dynamic relationships of a true marketplace. 
EDI does not provide for price transparency among a large number of suppliers, does not 
scale easily to include new participants, and is not a real-time communications environ-
ment. EDI does not have a rich communications environment that can simultaneously 
support e-mail messaging, video conferencing, sharing of graphic documents, network 
meetings, or user-friendly flexible database creation and management. 
MOBILE B2B
Just as with B2C commerce, mobile devices have become increasingly important in 
all aspects of B2B e-commerce, through all steps of the procurement process and 
throughout the supply chain. More and more companies have adopted a Bring Your 
Own Device (BYOD) policy, in which employees use their personal smartphone, 
tablet, or laptop computer on the company’s network, which has helped contribute to 
their growing importance in B2B. Cisco estimates that by 2016, mobile traffic will 
represent over 25% of all business Internet traffic, up from less than 5% in 2011 (Cisco 
Systems, Inc., 2015).
On the procurement front, B2B buyers are increasingly using mobile devices 
for all phases of the purchase process, from discovery to decision-making, to actual 
purchase. One study found that over 75% of B2B decision-makers surveyed used a 
mobile device to research products, equipment, services, and suppliers (eMarketer, 
2015). B2B buyers want to be able to place orders using mobile devices just as they do 
in the B2C arena, and increasingly expect B2B e-commerce sites to be readily acces-
sible from such devices, to be able to start an order from a device and finish it on their 
desktop and vice versa, and to be able to get online customer service on their mobile 
devices (eMarketer, Inc., 2015). 
On the supply chain front, many supply chain network and software providers 
are enhancing their offerings by providing support for mobile devices and applica-
tions. For instance, Elementum provides a variety of mobile apps running on a cloud 
platform to track various aspects of the supply chain and enable supply chain visibility. 
For instance, Elementum’s Exposure App enables companies to identify and respond 
to risks in their supply chain, providing real-time alerts on events that may impact 
the supply, manufacture, or distribution of components of their products. Elemen-
tum’s Perspective App helps companies monitor the health of their supply chain by

providing a dashboard that provides real-time tracking of key performance indicators 
(KPIs) in the supply chain. 
B2B IN THE CLOUD
In the traditional approach to B2B enterprise systems, firms build on their existing 
on-premise, enterprise production systems that keep track of their manufacturing 
and distribution processes to include new functionality connecting them to their sup-
pliers’ systems. This is a very expensive process that involves connecting suppliers 
one at a time, establishing the telecommunications channels, and managing the data 
quality issues, not to mention the cost of building the infrastructure of computers and 
telecommunications to support coordination of suppliers and B2B transactions. Cloud 
computing (described in Chapter 3) is increasingly being used to greatly reduce the 
cost of building and maintaining B2B systems. 
	 FIGURE 12.6	
CLOUD-BASED B2B PLATFORMS
Cloud-based B2B platforms integrate a firm’s customer data, business processes, and business partners into a cloud-based software system. 
Businesses are charged for the hardware and software platform on a utilization basis, reducing their costs significantly.

In cloud-based B2B systems, much of the expense of B2B systems is shifted from 
the firm to a B2B network provider, sometimes called a data hub or B2B platform (see 
Figure 12.6). The cloud platform owner provides the computing and telecommunica-
tions capability; establishes connections with the firm’s partners; provides software 
on-demand (software-as-a-service or SaaS) to connect the firm’s systems to its partners’ 
systems; performs data coordination and cleaning; and manages data quality for all 
members. Network effects apply here: the cost of these tasks and capabilities is spread 
over all members, reducing costs for all. B2B network providers also provide com-
munication environments and file storage services that allow partners to work together 
more closely, and to collaborate on improving the flow of goods and transactions. B2B 
network providers charge customers on a demand basis, rather than on a percentage 
of their transactions’ value, depending on their utilization of the network. Suppliers 
of traditional on-premise B2B and supply chain management systems have responded 
by purchasing cloud-based B2B networks in the last few years. For instance, SAP 
purchased Ariba, one of the first and largest cloud-based B2B transaction networks, in 
2012 for $4.6 billion. SAP Ariba’s global network automates more than $700 billion in 
commercial transactions, collaborations, and business intelligence among a wide range 
of suppliers, shipping, and logistics firms. SAP, the largest supplier of firm enterprise 
systems, supplies software that supports internal business processes. Other B2B 
network providers include E2Open, GT Nexus, and Elementum. 
Unlike traditional firm-based B2B systems, cloud-based B2B data networks can 
be implemented in short periods of time to respond to corporate mergers and rapidly 
changing markets, as Insight on Technology: Your Shoes Are in the Cloud illustrates. 
SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
Supply chain simplification, just in time and lean production, focusing on strategic 
partners in the production process, enterprise systems, and continuous inventory 
replenishment are the foundation for contemporary supply chain management (SCM) 
systems. Supply chain management (SCM) systems continuously link the activities 
of buying, making, and moving products from suppliers to purchasing firms, as well 
as integrating the demand side of the business equation by including the order entry 
system in the process. With an SCM system and continuous replenishment, inventory 
is greatly reduced and production begins only when an order is received (see Figure 
12.7). These systems enable just-in-time and lean-production methods. 
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is one of the largest technology companies in the world, 
with sales of $103 billion in 2015. With operations in over 150 countries, sales in 43 
currencies, and 15 languages, HP is truly a global firm with global supply chain issues 
that became even more complicated as HP expanded by making over 200 acquisi-
tions in the last decade. In 2016, HP has the largest supply chain among information 
technology manufacturers. To cope with one of the most complex supply chains in 
the world, HP developed a web-based, order-driven supply chain management system 
that begins with either a customer placing an order online or the receipt of an order 
from a dealer. The order is forwarded from the order entry system to HP’s production 
and delivery system. From there, the order is routed to one of several HP contractor 
supplier firms. The supplier’s system then verifies the order with HP and validates

INSIGHT ON TECHNOLOGY
YOUR SHOES ARE IN THE CLOUD 
Have you ever worn Keds, Hush 
Puppies, Merrells, Sebagos, Sperry 
Topsiders, or Sauconys? If so, you’ve 
had a product made by Wolverine 
World Wide Inc. on your feet. Although 
you may not be familiar with its name, Wol-
verine is one of the world’s largest designers, 
manufacturers, and marketers of footwear for 
sports, casual wear, and work. The company’s 
business is divided into three segments: its Life-
style Group includes Sperry Topsider, Stride Rite, 
Hush Puppies, and Keds. Its Performance Group 
includes Merrell, Saucony, Chaco, and Patago-
nia. The Heritage Group comprises brands such 
as Wolverine, Cat, Bates, Sebago, Harley-David-
son, and HyTest Safety. Wolverine was founded in 
Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1883, and originally 
made the boots that built America’s railroads, 
skyscrapers, and highways. Since then the com-
pany has expanded largely by purchasing well-
known name brand manufacturers. The company 
sells its footwear through national retailers, cata-
log sales, and consumer direct businesses at vari-
ous e-commerce websites. 
In 2015, Wolverine generated almost $2.7 
billion in revenue. In 2012, it purchased a total 
of four brands, including Saucony and Keds, that 
increased its revenue by $1 billion in a single year. 
The company has 6,600 employees worldwide. 
Today, Wolverine sources production of more than 
100 million pairs of shoes from 110 factories 
located in 20 countries. The company’s major com-
petitors are Nike (the global giant with $30 billion 
in revenue) and Deckers (with $1.8 billion in rev-
enue). The global footwear market is estimated to 
be $248 billion, with a 2.7% annual growth rate. 
Like many global consumer goods manu-
facturers, Wolverine has faced a number of chal-
lenges in managing its global supply chain and 
its retail distribution and sales processes. In the 
early 2000s, Wolverine’s supply chain manage-
ment capability was based on SAP’s BusinessSuite 
enterprise software. The SAP software central-
ized and consolidated its operations across all its 
brands and created an integrated system platform 
for managing the supply chain, customer relation-
ships, orders, and financial reporting. However, the 
system could not recognize multiple currencies, 
languages, or global standards. Signing up new 
suppliers or retail outlets was an expensive and 
sometimes lengthy process. Out-of-stock situations 
were growing as the company could not respond 
to retailer demands for specific styles. Matching 
inventory to actual demand was becoming more 
difficult as fashions changed rapidly. Working with 
global retailers was difficult at times because the 
existing system could not work with different lan-
guages and currencies. Many of the company’s 
largest global retailers were not comfortable 
transacting in dollars. In response, Wolverine 
expanded its SAP enterprise system by adopt-
ing the software firm’s SAP Retail solutions. This 
new system had global capabilities that enable 
different languages and currencies to be used for 
transactions and communications. The new system 
also allowed Wolverine managers as well as their 
retail partners to gain increased, real-time visibil-
ity into consumer demand, supply chain, and store 
operations. As a result, stock outs have declined, 
and revenues at retail stores have increased 15 to 
25% in various segments. 
On the supplier side of its operations, Wol-
verine also faced significant challenges. Its 2012 
acquisition of Saucony and Keds brought in an 
additional $1 billion worth of transactions to pro-
cess, and might have quickly overwhelmed its 
domestic supply chain’s systems. Its SAP enter-
prise system was a traditional on-premise, very

large system that was designed to enhance Wol-
verine’s supply chain, and not the entire ecosystem 
of manufacturing, logistics, and financial firms that 
work with Wolverine to manufacture and distrib-
ute shoes. Wolverine in fact had over 200 suppliers 
in 120 countries that had their own supply chain 
software, and integrating them into a single plat-
form was unimaginable, costly, and time consum-
ing. There was no easy (or inexpensive) way to 
scale up its existing supply chain system to include 
all its partners, and their millions of transactions. 
It was difficult for its global suppliers to sign up to 
Wolverine’s domestic system, the payment system 
was outdated, and logistics and finance were not 
supported in the existing system. 
For help Wolverine turned to GT Nexus, a 
provider of a cloud-based supply chain platform. 
GT Nexus is a network of supply chain networks 
that allows firms to tie their own supply chain 
systems into a global platform and communi-
cate with their partners, who may be manufac-
turers, shipping companies, finance firms, and 
retailers. Unlike with traditional enterprise soft-
ware, Wolverine does not buy the package, or 
pay monthly rental costs, or host the software 
on its servers. Instead, GT Nexus provides an on-
demand, pay-as-you-go, software-as-a-service 
(SaaS) model. Some of the services provided 
include supplier enablement, purchase-to-pay-
ment financial tracking, tracking of packing and 
shipping, financing of transactions, freight con-
tracting, auditing, documentation and customs, 
and in-transit tracking. GT Nexus bills itself as 
an on-demand, cloud-based, global supply chain 
management platform. Currently, GT Nexus 
supports supply chain management at 25,000 
companies, has over 100,000 users, and 
manages an estimated $100 billion in 
trades. It also facilitates more than $20 bil-
lion in payments between buyers and their sup-
pliers in 90 countries and in eight currencies. 
In addition to Wolverine, GT Nexus custom-
ers include Adidas, Nike, Caterpillar, Columbia 
Sportswear, DHL, Home Depot, Levi Strauss, 
Pfizer, and UPS, among many others.
Using GT Nexus, Wolverine can provide its 
suppliers, retailers, logistics, and financial part-
ners a single login to the global Wolverine supply 
chain. Wolverine managers and their supply part-
ners can see the entire supply chain from suppliers 
of raw materials, to manufacturers, transporters, 
and ultimately retail store orders. With its new 
supply and distribution systems in place, Wolverine 
is able to spot under-performing stores and brands. 
In the past two years, it has closed over 200 out-
lets, and dropped two brands from its product line. 
In August 2015, Infor, one of the world’s lead-
ing suppliers of enterprise resource planning soft-
ware, announced that it would acquire GT Nexus 
for $675 million. Infor’s current business focuses 
on applications within an enterprise, and it cur-
rently counts among its customers 18 of the top 
aerospace companies, all of the top 10 pharma-
ceutical companies, and 17 of the top 20 industrial 
distributors. Adding GT Nexus will enable Infor to 
expand its reach beyond the walls of an organiza-
tion into its supply chain and allow businesses to 
better integrate merchandising, marketing, and 
demand data into supply chain management. Infor 
currently uses Amazon Web Services to deliver its 
cloud SaaS ERP software, and plans to add GT 
Nexus’s software to that platform as well.

the ordered configuration to ensure the PC can be manufactured (e.g., will not have 
missing parts or fail a design specification set by HP). The order is then forwarded to 
a computer-based production control system that issues a bar-coded production ticket 
to factory assemblers. Simultaneously, a parts order is forwarded to the supplier’s 
warehouse and inventory management system. A worker assembles the computer, 
and then the computer is boxed, tagged, and shipped to the customer. The delivery is 
monitored and tracked by HP’s supply chain management system, which links directly 
to one of several overnight delivery systems. The elapsed time from order entry to 
shipping is 48 hours. With this system, HP has eliminated the need to hold PCs in 
inventory, reduced cycle time from one week to 48 hours, and reduced errors. HP has 
extended this system to become a global B2B order tracking, reporting, and support 
system for HP B2B customers (Hewlett-Packard, 2015a, 2015b). 
It isn’t just huge technology companies that use supply chain software. There’s 
nothing quite so perishable as fashionable underwear given the rate of fashion change. 
Under Armour, which is the world’s No. 1 performance athletic brand, uses software 
from SAP to predict sales, plan inventory, and coordinate suppliers (SAP, 2015; Gilmore, 
2014). Prior to using these tools, Under Armour often missed sales because it did not 
produce enough of popular items, or overproduced items that were not selling.

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
SCM systems coordinate the activities of suppliers, shippers, and order entry systems to automate order 
entry through production, payment, and shipping business processes. Increasingly customers, as well as 
employees working throughout the supply chain, are using smartphones, tablets, and mobile apps to place 
and coordinate orders.

COLLABORATIVE COMMERCE
Collaborative commerce is a direct extension of supply chain management systems, 
as well as supply chain simplification. Collaborative commerce is defined as the use 
of digital technologies to permit firms to collaboratively design, develop, build, market, 
and manage products through their life cycles. This is a much broader mission than 
EDI or simply managing the flow of information among organizations. ­Collaborative 
commerce involves a definitive move from a transaction focus to a relationship focus 
among the supply chain participants. Rather than having an arm’s-length adversarial 
relationship with suppliers, collaborative commerce fosters sharing of sensitive 
­internal information with suppliers and purchasers. Managing collaborative commerce 
requires knowing exactly what information to share with whom. Collaborative com-
merce extends beyond supply chain management activities to include the collaborative 
development of new products and services by multiple cooperating firms.
A good example of collaborative commerce is the long-term effort of Procter & 
Gamble (P&G), the world’s largest manufacturer of personal and health care products, 
from Crest toothpaste to Tide soap, to work with suppliers and even customers to 
develop 50% of its product line over time. In the past, for instance, P&G would design 
a bottle or product package in-house, and then turn to over 100 suppliers of packaging 
to find out what it would cost and try to bargain that down. Using Ariba’s procurement 
network, P&G asks its suppliers to come up with innovative ideas for packaging and 
pricing. Taking it a step further, P&G’s website, Pgconnectdevelop.com, solicits new 
product ideas from suppliers and customers. About 50% of P&G’s new products origi-
nate with substantial input from its suppliers and customers. P&G is also collaborating 
with its biggest online customer, Amazon, by co-locating their operations. P&G sets 
aside warehouse space for P&G products purchased by Amazon customers. Amazon 
ships the products to its customers directly from the P&G warehouses rather than ship-
ping them first to Amazon warehouses, and then to the consumer. This collaboration 
results in Amazon reducing its costs of shipping and storing goods, becoming more 
competitive on price compared to Walmart and Costco, and reducing the time it takes 
to arrive at consumers’ homes. For P&G collaboration means savings on transporta-
tion costs incurred trucking products to Amazon warehouses, and Amazon’s help in 
boosting online sales of P&G products. Other well-known companies using collabora-
tion to develop and deliver products include Harley Davidson, Starbucks, and GE’s 
Ecomagination program (Carlozo, 2015; Winston, 2014).
Although collaborative commerce can involve customers as well as suppliers in the 
development of products, for the most part, it is concerned with the development of a 
rich communications environment to enable inter-firm sharing of designs, production 
plans, inventory levels, delivery schedules, and the development of shared products 
(see Figure 12.8).
Collaborative commerce is very different from EDI, which is a technology for 
structured communications among firms. Collaborative commerce is more like an 
interactive teleconference among members of the supply chain. EDI and collaborative 
commerce share one characteristic: they are not open, competitive marketplaces, but

Collaboration 2.0: Cloud, Web, Social, and Mobile 
The technology of collaborative commerce has changed greatly since its inception 
over thirty years ago with tools like Lotus Notes, which was used almost entirely 
within firms to establish an environment where employees could share ideas, notes, 
and ideas, and work on projects together. What’s new about collaboration tools today 
is that the software and data are stored on cloud servers where it is less expensive, 
and easy to update; social networks like Facebook and Twitter are commonly used by 
employees in many firms, while other firms deploy their own social network platform; 
the Web enables very inexpensive collaborative environments; and the mobile platform 
of smartphones and tablets means that collaboration can take place in many more 
places and times (Computerworld, 2015; Gohring, 2014). Collaboration technologies 
have expanded collaboration from a within-the-firm platform to a primary tool of 
inter-firm B2B collaboration. 
Broadband video network systems like Cisco’s TelePresence also play a role in 
enabling frequent, long-distance, collaboration among supply chain partners. TelePres-
ence is one of several high-bandwidth video systems from different vendors that give 
users the impression they are sharing ­physical space with other participants who are 
in fact located remotely, sometimes on the other side of the globe. Cisco TelePresence’s 
Twitter feed enhances the TelePresence experience by adding face-to-face support, 
scheduling assistance, and demos (Cisco Systems, Inc., 2016b; Cisco Systems, Inc. and 
Vital Images, 2016). Using Skype video conferencing, even tiny businesses can take 
advantage of very inexpensive collaborative platforms over the Web, or mobile platforms.
	 FIGURE 12.8	
ELEMENTS OF A COLLABORATIVE COMMERCE SYSTEM
A collaborative commerce application includes a cloud repository where employees at several different firms 
can store engineering drawings and other documents. Workflow software determines who can see this data 
and what rules will apply for displaying the data on individual workstations.

In Section 12.5, we discuss collaborative commerce in greater depth as a technol-
ogy that enables private industrial networks.
SOCIAL NETWORKS AND B2B: THE EXTENDED SOCIAL ENTERPRISE
It’s a short step from collaboration with vendors, suppliers, and customers, to a more 
personal relationship based on conversations with participants in the supply chain 
using social networks—both private and public. Here, the conversations and sharing of 
ideas are more unstructured, situational, and personal. Procurement officers, manag-
ers of supply chains, and logistics managers are people too, and they participate in 
the same social network culture provided by Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, 
and a host of other public social networks as we all do. Being able to respond to 
fast moving developments that affect supply chains requires something more than a 
website, e-mail, or telephone calls. Social networks can provide the intimate connec-
tions among customers, suppliers, and logistics partners that are needed to keep the 
supply chain functioning, and to make decisions based on current conditions (Demery, 
2015; Red Prairie, 2012). 
Participants in the supply chain network are tapping into their tablet computers, 
smartphones, and social network sites for purchasing, scheduling, exception handling, 
and deciding with their B2B customers and suppliers. In many cases, supply chain 
social networks are private—owned by the largest firm in the supply chain network. 
In other cases, firms develop Facebook pages to organize conversations among supply 
chain network members. 
Social networks are beginning to be common tools for managers engaged in B2B 
commerce. Public social network sites like Facebook and Twitter can be excellent for 
coordinating the flow of information among business partners through the supply 
chain. Cisco is using its website, Twitter, and Facebook to run new product campaigns 
for its business customers using social networks exclusively. Dell, like many busi-
nesses, uses its YouTube channel to engage suppliers and customers in conversations 
about existing products, and ideas for new products (Cargill, 2015). 
B2B MARKETING 
Despite the size of the B2B e-commerce, B2B marketing in 2015 accounted for only 
a relatively small slice (about $6 billion) of the total amount spent on digital mar-
keting and advertising (about $58 billion) (eMarketer, Inc., 2016a). While some of 
this disparity results from the slow pace of technological change in supply chain 
and procurement management, it also reflects the very different nature of much of 
B2B e-commerce when compared to B2C e-commerce. Long-term sourcing typically 
involves large purchases with commercial relationships that can last several years 
or longer. The sellers and buyers may have known about each other for years, even 
decades; the capabilities and financial situation of the firms are known. Both parties 
share an understanding of the price and quality of what is being exchanged in the 
market. In these situations, B2C retail marketing tactics are not appropriate. Instead, 
interpersonal relationships, networking, brand, and informative content market-
ing using white papers, videos, podcasts, webinars, blogs, e-books, conferences, 

794	
	
C H A P T E R  1 2     B 2 B  E - c o m m e r c e :  S u p p l y  C h a i n  M a n a g e m e n t  a n d  C o l l a b o r a t i v e  C o m m e r c e
and professional associations are the primary and most effective marketing tools 
(eMarketer, Inc., 2016b). Content marketing refers to using informative media to 
promote sales rather than advertising the availability and price typical of display 
and search advertising in B2C markets (see Chapter 6). E-mail and social networks 
can play a role in content marketing by making potential customers aware of new 
media content. 
However, in spot purchase markets for MRO or other commodity products, B2B 
marketing uses many of the same marketing tactics and tools found in B2C market-
ing: display ads, search engine marketing, websites, social network channels, videos, 
and mobile ads. The use of mobile advertising in B2B marketing has grown as mobile 
devices play a larger role in workplaces. Almost two-thirds (65%) of B2B marketers 
use a mobile website or apps that connect customers directly to their marketplaces. 
Mobile advertising (largely on newsfeeds or display ads on social networks such as 
LinkedIn), mobile search, and in-app ads are used by roughly 40% of B2B marketers 
(eMarketer, Inc., 2015). While mobile B2B marketing is growing, it consumes only 5% 
of B2B marketing budgets, compared to nearly 9% of B2C marketing budgets. One 
reason is that purchasing agents do not appreciate having their newsfeeds and mobile 
experience interrupted by their suppliers’ mobile messages. Generally, purchasing 
agents know what they want, and when they want it. 
Other trends in B2B marketing include sales enablement systems and the use of 
predictive analytics. Sales enablement systems keep track of leads developed from 
websites, e-mail, and mobile apps, and help the salesforce track these prospective 
customers through the point of purchase (eMarketer, Inc., 2016b). Predictive analytics 
help B2B marketers estimate the lifetime value of leads based on past marketing data 
(eMarketer, Inc., 2016c).
	12.4	 NET MARKETPLACES: THE SELLING SIDE OF B2B
One of the most compelling visions of B2B e-commerce is that of an online market-
place that would bring thousands of fragmented suppliers into contact with hundreds 
of major purchasers of industrial goods for the purpose of conducting frictionless com-
merce. The hope was that these suppliers would compete with one another on price, 
transactions would be automated and low cost, and as a result, the price of industrial 
supplies would fall. By extracting fees from buyers and sellers on each transaction, 
third-party intermediary market makers could earn significant revenues. We refer 
to these online markets as Net marketplaces. Net marketplaces are sell-side digital 
environments that bring suppliers and buyers together. These Net marketplaces could 
scale easily as volume increased by simply adding more computers and communica-
tions equipment.
In pursuit of this vision, well over 1,500 Net marketplaces sprang up in the early 
days of e-commerce. Unfortunately, many of them have since disappeared but some still 
survive, and they are joined by other types of Net marketplaces—some private and some 
public—based on different assumptions and business models that are quite successful.

CHARACTERISTICS OF NET MARKETPLACES
There is a confusing variety of Net marketplaces today, and several different ways to 
classify them. For instance, some classify Net marketplaces on the basis of their pricing 
mechanisms—fixed prices or more dynamic pricing, such as negotiation, auction or 
bid/ask—while others classify markets based on characteristics of the markets they 
serve (vertical versus horizontal, or sell-side versus buy-side), or ownership indepen-
dent third-party intermediaries (which is most common) or industry-owned consortia. 
Although the primary benefits and biases of Net marketplaces have to be determined 
on a case-by-case basis depending on ownership and pricing mechanisms, it is often 
the case that Net marketplaces are biased against suppliers because they can force 
suppliers to reveal their prices and terms to other suppliers in the marketplace. Table 
12.3 describes some of the important characteristics of Net marketplaces.
TYPES OF NET MARKETPLACES
Although each of these distinctions helps describe the phenomenon of Net market-
places, they do not focus on the central business functionality provided, nor are they 
capable by themselves of describing the variety of Net marketplaces.
In Figure 12.9, we present a classification of Net marketplaces that focuses on 
their business functionality; that is, what these Net marketplaces provide for ­businesses 
seeking solutions. We use two dimensions of Net marketplaces to create a four-cell 
classification table. We differentiate Net marketplaces as providing either ­indirect 
goods (goods used to support production) or direct goods (goods used in production), 
and we distinguish markets as providing either contractual purchasing (where pur-
chases take place over many years according to a contract between the firm and its 
vendor) or spot purchasing (where purchases are episodic and ­anonymous—vendors 
and buyers do not have an ongoing relationship and may not know one another). The 
intersection of these dimensions produces four main types of Net ­marketplaces that 
are relatively straightforward: e-distributors, e-procurement networks, exchanges, and 

796	
	
C H A P T E R  1 2     B 2 B  E - c o m m e r c e :  S u p p l y  C h a i n  M a n a g e m e n t  a n d  C o l l a b o r a t i v e  C o m m e r c e
industry consortia. Note, however, that in the real world, some Net marketplaces can 
be found in multiple parts of this figure as business models change and opportunities 
appear and disappear. Nevertheless, the discussion of “pure types” of Net marketplaces 
is a useful starting point.
Each of these Net marketplaces seeks to provide value to customers in different 
ways. We discuss each type of Net marketplace in more detail in the following sections.
E-distributors
E-distributors are the most common and most easily understood type of Net market-
place. An e-distributor provides an online catalog that represents the products of 
thousands of direct manufacturers (see Figure 12.10). E-distributors are indepen-
dently owned intermediaries that offer industrial customers a single source from 
which to order indirect goods (often referred to as MRO) on a spot, as-needed basis. A 
significant percentage of corporate purchases cannot be satisfied under a company’s 
existing contracts, and must be purchased on a spot basis. E-distributors make money 
by charging a markup on products they distribute.

PURE TYPES OF NET MARKETPLACES
There are four main types of Net marketplaces based on the intersection of two dimensions: how businesses 
buy and what they buy. A third dimension—horizontal versus vertical markets—also distinguishes the 
different types of Net marketplaces.

	 FIGURE 12.10	
E-DISTRIBUTORS
E-distributors are firms that bring the products of thousands of suppliers into a single online catalog for sale 
to thousands of buyer firms. E-distributors are sometimes referred to as one-to-many markets, one seller 
serving many firms.
Organizations and firms in all industries require MRO supplies. The MRO func-
tion maintains, repairs, and operates commercial buildings and maintains all the 
machinery of these buildings from heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems 
to lighting fixtures.
E-distributors operate in horizontal markets because they serve many different 
industries with products from many different suppliers. E-distributors usually operate 
public markets in the sense that any firm can order from the catalog, as opposed to 
private markets, where membership is restricted to selected firms.
E-distributor prices are usually fixed, but large customers receive discounts and 
other incentives to purchase, such as credit, reporting on account activity, and limited 
forms of business purchasing rules (for instance, no purchases greater than $500 for 
a single item without a purchase order). The primary benefits offered to industrial 
customers are lower search costs, lower transaction costs, wide selection, rapid deliv-
ery, and low prices.
W.W. Grainger is one of the most frequently cited examples of an e-distributor. 
Grainger is involved in long-term systematic sourcing as well as spot sourcing, but 
its emphasis is on spot sourcing. Grainger’s mission is to become the world’s leading 
source of MRO suppliers. Its revenue model is that of a typical retailer: it owns the 
products and takes a markup on the products it sells to customers. Grainger’s website 
and mobile apps provide users with a digital version of Grainger’s famous seven-pound 
catalog, plus other parts not available in the catalog (adding up to around 1.4 million 
parts), as well as a complete ordering and payment system. In 2015, Grainger recorded

$3.3 billion in e-commerce revenues (41% of its total sales), up 14% from 2014 (W.W. 
Grainger Inc., 2016). McMaster-Carr, a New Jersey-based industrial parts mecca for 
machinists and manufacturers around the world, is a similar e-distributor. As you 
learned in the opening case, Amazon also entered the B2B distributor market with 
AmazonSupply, aiming to leverage its global B2C fulfillment infrastructure into the 
B2B arena, and in 2015, rebranded it as Amazon Business. Amazon Business primarily 
engages in spot sales of business products and provides a trading platform for multiple 
sellers. eBay entered the B2B e-distributors fray by rebranding its eBay Business mar-
ketplace in 2016. Other examples of e-distributors include B2Buy and NeweggBusiness.
E-procurement
An e-procurement Net marketplace is an independently owned intermediary that 
connects hundreds of online suppliers offering millions of maintenance and repair 
parts to business firms who pay fees to join the market (see Figure 12.11). 
­E-procurement Net marketplaces are typically used for long-term contractual 
­purchasing of indirect goods (MRO); they create online horizontal markets, but they 
also provide for members’ spot sourcing of MRO supplies. E-procurement companies 
make money by ­charging a percentage of each transaction, licensing consulting ser-
vices and software, and ­assessing network use fees (Trkman and McCormack, 2010).

E-PROCUREMENT NET MARKETPLACES
E-procurement Net marketplaces aggregate hundreds of catalogs in a single marketplace and make them 
available to firms, often on a custom basis that reflects only the suppliers desired by the participating firms.

E-procurement companies expand on the business model of simpler e-distributors 
by including the online catalogs of hundreds of suppliers and offering value chain 
management services to both buyers and sellers. Value chain management (VCM) 
services provided by e-procurement companies include automation of a firm’s entire 
procurement process on the buyer side and automation of the selling business 
­processes on the seller side. For purchasers, e-procurement companies automate 
­purchase orders, requisitions, sourcing, business rules enforcement, invoicing, and 
payment. For ­suppliers, e-procurement companies provide catalog creation and 
content management, order management, fulfillment, invoicing, shipment, and 
settlement.
E-procurement Net marketplaces are sometimes referred to as many-to-many 
markets. They are mediated by an independent third party that purports to represent 
both buyers and sellers, and hence claim to be neutral. On the other hand, because 
they may include the catalogs of both competing suppliers and competing e-distribu-
tors, they likely have a bias in favor of the buyers. Nevertheless, by aggregating huge 
buyer firms into their networks, they provide distinct marketing benefits for suppliers 
and reduce customer acquisition costs.
Ariba stands out as one of the poster children of the B2B age, a firm born before 
its time. Promising to revolutionize inter-firm trade, Ariba started out in 1996 hoping 
to build a global business network linking buyers and sellers—sort of an eBay for busi-
ness. With little revenue, the stock shot past $1,000 a share by March 2000. But sellers 
and buyers did not join the network in large part because they did not understand 
the opportunity, were too wedded to their traditional procurement processes, and did 
not trust outsiders to control their purchasing and vendor relationship. In September 
2001, Ariba’s share price tanked to $2.20. Ariba survived largely by selling software 
that helped large firms understand their procurement processes and costs. Finally, by 
2008, large and small firms had become more sophisticated in their purchasing and 
supply change management practices, and Ariba’s original idea of a global network 
of suppliers and purchasers of a wide variety of industrial goods came back to life. In 
2012, SAP, the largest enterprise software firm, purchased Ariba for $4.3 billion in an 
effort to strengthen its B2B e-commerce suite. Today, SAP Ariba is a leading provider 
of collaborative business commerce solutions that includes an e-procurement Net 
marketplace called the Ariba Supplier Network. Other players in this market segment 
include Perfect Commerce, BravoSolution, A.T. Kearney Procurement & Analytic 
Solutions, and IBM Emptoris Sourcing. 
Exchanges
An exchange is an independently owned online marketplace that connects hundreds 
to potentially thousands of suppliers and buyers in a dynamic, real-time environment 
(see Figure 12.12). Although there are exceptions, exchanges generally create vertical 
markets that focus on the spot-purchasing requirements of large firms in a single 
industry, such as computers and telecommunications, electronics, food, and industrial 
equipment. Exchanges were the prototype Internet-based marketplace in the early

days of e-commerce; as noted previously, over 1,500 were created in this period, but 
most have failed.
Exchanges make money by charging a commission on the transaction. The pricing 
model can be through an online negotiation, auction, RFQ, or fixed buy-and-sell prices. 
The benefits offered to customers of exchanges include reduced search cost for parts 
and spare capacity. Other benefits include lower prices created by a global marketplace 
driven by competition among suppliers who would, presumably, sell goods at very low 
profit margins at one world-market price. The benefits offered suppliers are access to 
a global purchasing environment and the opportunity to unload production overruns 
(although at very competitive prices and low profit margins). Even though they are 
private intermediaries, exchanges are public in the sense of permitting any bona fide 
buyer or seller to participate.
Exchanges tend to be biased toward the buyer even though they are independently 
owned and presumably neutral. Suppliers are disadvantaged by the fact that exchanges 
put them in direct price competition with other similar suppliers around the globe, 
driving profit margins down. Exchanges have failed in the past primarily because 
suppliers have refused to join them, and hence, the existing markets have very low 
liquidity, defeating the very purpose and benefits of an exchange. Liquidity is typi-
cally measured by the number of buyers and sellers in a market, the volume of transac-
tions, and the size of transactions. You know a market is liquid when you can buy or

number of buyers and

EXCHANGES
Independent exchanges bring potentially thousands of suppliers to a vertical (industry-specific) marketplace 
to sell their goods to potentially thousands of buyer firms. Exchanges are sometimes referred to as many-to-
many markets because they have many suppliers serving many buyer firms.

many exchanges failed, resulting in a very small number of participants, few trades, 
and small trade value per transaction. The most common reason for not using 
exchanges is the absence of traditional, trusted suppliers.
While most exchanges tend to be vertical marketplaces offering direct supplies, 
some exchanges offer indirect inputs as well, such as electricity and power, transporta-
tion services (usually to the transportation industry), and professional services. Table 
12.4 lists a few examples of some current independent exchanges.
The following capsule descriptions of two exchanges provide insight into their 
origins and current functions.
Global Wine & Spirits (GWS) is unique among independent exchanges, not only as 
a startup that has managed to survive, but also as a latecomer to the B2B e-commerce 
community. GWS opened in 1999, but did not begin to trade products online until May 
2001. Based in Montreal, Quebec, GWS is operated by Mediagrif Interactive Technolo-
gies Inc., a Canadian company that operates a number of independent exchanges in a 
variety of industries. GWS offers a spot marketplace for wines, where wine and spirit 
producers offer wines for sale; a call for tenders market, where members make offers 
to purchase wines and spirits; a trade database with listings of thousands of industry 
professionals; and a wine and spirits catalog with over 35,000 products and 6,700 
companies (Globalwinespirits.com, 2016).
Inventory Locator Service (ILS) has its roots as an offline intermediary, serving 
as a listing service for aftermarket parts in the aerospace industry. Upon opening in 
1979, ILS initially provided a telephone and fax-based directory of aftermarket parts to 
airplane owners and mechanics, along with government procurement professionals. 
As early as 1984, ILS incorporated e-mail capabilities as part of its RFQ services, and 
by 1998, it had begun to conduct online auctions for hard-to-find parts. In 2016, ILS 
maintains an Internet-accessible database of over 85 million aerospace and marine 
industry parts, and has also developed an eRFQ feature that helps users streamline 
their sourcing processes. The network’s 23,000 subscribers in 93 different countries 
access the site over 75,000 times a day (Inventory Locator Service, 2016).

Industry Consortia
An industry consortium is an industry-owned vertical market that enables buyers 
in the industry to purchase direct inputs (both goods and services) (see Figure 12.13). 
Industry consortia emphasize long-term contractual purchasing, the development of 
stable relationships (as opposed to merely an anonymous transaction emphasis), and 
the creation of industry-wide data standards and synchronization efforts. Industry 
consortia are more focused on optimizing long-term supply relationships than inde-
pendent exchanges, which tend to focus more on short-term transactions. The ultimate 
objective of industry consortia is the unification of supply chains within entire indus-
tries, across many tiers, through common data definitions, network standards, and 
computing platforms. 
Industry consortia sprang up in part as a reaction to the development of indepen-
dently owned exchanges, which were viewed by large industries (such as the automo-
tive and chemical industries) as market interlopers that would not directly serve the 
interests of large buyers, but would instead line their own pockets and those of their

INDUSTRY CONSORTIA
Industry consortia bring thousands of suppliers into direct contact with a smaller number of very large 
buyers. The market makers provide value-added software services for procurement, transaction 
management, shipping, and payment for both buyers and suppliers. Industry consortia are sometimes 
referred to as many-to-few markets, where many suppliers (albeit selected by the buyers) serve a few very 
large buyers, mediated by a variety of value-added services.

venture capital investors. Rather than “pay-to-play,” large firms decided to “pay-to-
own” their markets. Another concern of large firms was that Net marketplaces would 
work only if large suppliers and buyers participated, and only if there was liquidity. 
Independent exchanges were not attracting enough players to achieve liquidity. In 
addition, exchanges often failed to provide additional value-added services that would 
transform the value chain for the entire industry, including linking the new market-
places to firms’ ERP systems. 
Industry consortia make money in a number of ways. Industry members usually 
pay for the creation of the consortia’s capabilities and contribute initial operating 
capital. Then industry consortia charge buyer and seller firms transaction and sub-
scription fees. Industry members—both buyers and sellers—are expected to reap 
benefits far greater than their contributions through the rationalization of the procure-
ment process, competition among vendors, and closer relationships with vendors.
Industry consortia offer many different pricing mechanisms, ranging from 
­auctions to fixed prices to RFQs, depending on the products and the situation. Prices 
can also be negotiated, and the environment, while competitive, is nevertheless 
restricted to a smaller number of buyers—selected, reliable, and long-term suppliers 
who are often viewed as strategic industry partners. The bias of industry consortia is 
clearly toward the large buyers who control access to this lucrative market channel 
and can benefit from competitive pricing offered by alternative suppliers. Benefits to 
suppliers come from access to large buyer firm procurement systems, long-term stable 
relationships, and large order sizes.
Industry consortia can force suppliers to use the consortia’s ­networks and propri-
etary software as a condition of selling to the industry’s members. Although exchanges 
failed for a lack of suppliers and liquidity, the market power of consortia members 
ensures suppliers will participate, so consortia may be able to avoid the fate of vol-
untary exchanges. Clearly, industry consortia are at an advantage when compared to 
independent exchanges because, unlike the venture-capital-backed exchanges, they 
have deep-pocket financial backing from the very start and guaranteed liquidity based 
on a steady flow of large firm orders. Yet industry consortia are a relatively new 
phenomenon, and the long-term profitability of these consortia, especially when 
several consortia exist for a single industry, has yet to be demonstrated. In fact, the 
number of firms that can be defined as purely industry consortia has declined since 
the early 2000s, with many firms broadening their mission to encompass more than 
one industry, or more commonly, being sold by the original industry founders to 
private investors. For example, GHX, originally founded in 2000 by companies in the 
pharmaceutical and medical supply industry, is now owned by a private equity firm. 
E2open, originally founded by IBM, Seagate, and Hitachi as an industry consortium for 
companies in the high technology industries, has since become a public company and 
now provides a cloud-based B2B platform and services for a wide variety of industries. 
However, a number of industry consortia do remain. One example is The Seam, 
which was founded in 2000 by leading global agribusiness companies such as Cargill, 
Louis Dreyfus, and others. The Seam focused initially on creating a cotton trading 
exchange, and has since added peanuts, grains, and excess USDA farm commodities.

The Seam has handled over $5 billion in transactions since inception and more than 
90% of the cotton buyers in the United States are active participants in its Cotton 
Trading system. Table 12.5 lists some additional examples.
	12.5	 PRIVATE INDUSTRIAL NETWORKS
Private industrial networks are the most prevalent form of B2B e-commerce in terms 
of transaction volume, and are expected to continue to be so into the foreseeable 
future. Private industrial networks can be considered the foundation of the extended 
enterprise, allowing firms to extend their boundaries and their business processes to 
include supply chain and logistics partners.
As noted at the beginning of this chapter, private industrial networks are direct 
descendants of existing EDI networks and are closely tied to existing ERP systems 
used by large firms. Like EDI, private industrial networks are owned by the buyers 
and are buyer-side solutions with buyer biases, but they offer significant benefits for 
suppliers as well. Inclusion in the direct supply chain for a major industrial purchasing 
company can allow a supplier to increase both revenue and margins because the 
environment is not competitive—only a few suppliers are included in the private 
industrial network. A private industrial network is a web-enabled network for the 
coordination of trans-organizational business processes (sometimes also called col-
laborative commerce). A trans-organizational business process requires at least 
two independent firms to perform (Laudon and Laudon, 2016). For the most part, these 
networks originate in and closely involve the manufacturing and related support 
industries, and therefore we refer to them as industrial networks, although in the 
future they could just as easily apply to some services. Private industrial networks can 
be viewed as extended enterprises in the sense that they often begin as ERP systems 
in a single firm, and are then expanded to include the firm’s major suppliers. Figure 
12.14 illustrates a private industrial network originally built by Procter & Gamble 
(P&G) in the United States to coordinate supply chains among its suppliers, distribu-
tors, truckers, and retailers.

PROCTER & GAMBLE’S PRIVATE INDUSTRIAL NETWORK
Procter & Gamble’s private industrial network attempts to coordinate the trans-organizational business 
processes of the many firms it deals with in the consumer products industry.
In P&G’s private industrial network shown in Figure 12.14, customer sales are 
captured at the cash register, which then initiates a flow of information back to dis-
tributors, P&G, and its suppliers. This tells P&G and its suppliers the exact level of 
demand for thousands of products. This information is then used to initiate production, 
supply, and transportation to replenish products at the distributors and retailers. This 
process is called an efficient customer response system (a demand-pull production 
model), and it relies on an equally efficient supply chain management system to 
coordinate the supply side (Gartner, Inc., 2015). In 2015 P&G began the process of 
transforming its supply chain system into a fully integrated, end-to-end supply base 
that enables the creation of joint business plans with its suppliers. Coordinating this 
supply base is a control tower environment, replete with wrap-around room monitors, 
where real-time supply data is continuously analyzed by teams of analysts (Banker, 
2015). P&G’s distribution goal is to deliver products within one day of shipping to 80% 
of its retailers. P&G is the world’s largest consumer goods manufacturer, and for many 
years has been ranked as the leading supply chain manager. 
GE, Dell, Cisco, Volkswagen, Microsoft, IBM, Nike, Coca-Cola, Walmart, Nokia, and 
Hewlett-Packard are among the firms operating successful private industrial networks.
OBJECTIVES OF PRIVATE INDUSTRIAL NETWORKS
The specific objectives of a private industrial network include:
•	 Developing efficient purchasing and selling business processes industry-wide
•	 Developing industry-wide resource planning to supplement enterprise-wide 
resource planning
•	 Increasing supply chain visibility—knowing the inventory levels of buyers and suppliers

806

•	 Achieving closer buyer-supplier relationships, including demand forecasting, com-
munications, and conflict resolution
•	 Operating on a global scale—globalization
•	 Reducing risk by preventing imbalances of supply and demand, including develop-
ing financial derivatives, insurance, and futures markets
Private industrial networks serve different goals from Net marketplaces. Net mar-
ketplaces are primarily transaction-oriented, whereas private industrial networks focus 
on continuous business process coordination between companies. This can include 
much more than just supply chain management, such as product design, sourcing, 
demand forecasting, asset management, sales, and marketing. Private industrial net-
works do support transactions, but that is not their primary focus.
Private industrial networks usually focus on a single sponsoring company that 
“owns” the network, sets the rules, establishes governance (a structure of authority, 
rule enforcement, and control), and invites firms to participate at its sole discretion. 
Therefore, these networks are private. This sets them apart from industry consortia, 
which are usually owned by major firms collectively through equity participation. 
Whereas Net marketplaces have a strong focus on indirect goods and services, private 
industrial networks focus on strategic, direct goods and services.
For instance, True Value is one of the largest retailer-owned hardware coop-
eratives with operations in 54 countries, 4,500 stores, and 12 regional distribution 
centers. The logistics are staggering to consider: they routinely process over 60,000 
domestic inbound loads, and over 600 million pounds of freight. True Value imports 
roughly 3,500 containers through 20 international ports and 10 domestic ports. The 
existing inbound supply chain system was fragmented, did not permit real-time track-
ing of packages, and when shipments were short or damaged, could not alert stores. 
The supply chain was “invisible”: suppliers could not see store inventory levels, and 
stores could not see supplier shipments. Using a web-based solution from Sterling 
Commerce (an IBM company), True Value created its own private industrial network 
to which all suppliers, shippers, and stores have exclusive access. The network focuses 
on three processes: domestic prepaid shipping, domestic collect, and international 
direct shipping. For each process the network tracks in real time the movement of 
goods from suppliers to shippers, warehouses, and stores. The system has led to a 57% 
reduction in lead time needed for orders, a 10% increase in the fill rate of orders, and 
an 85% reduction in back orders. If goods are delayed, damaged, or unavailable, the 
system alerts all parties automatically (True Value, 2016; IBM, 2011). 
Perhaps no single firm better illustrates the benefits of developing private indus-
trial networks than Walmart, described in Insight on Business: Walmart Develops a 
Private Industrial Network.
PRIVATE INDUSTRIAL NETWORKS AND COLLABORATIVE COMMERCE
Private industrial networks can do much more than just serve a supply chain and 
efficient customer response system. They can also include other activities of a single 
large manufacturing firm, such as design of products and engineering diagrams, as well 
as marketing plans and demand forecasting. Collaboration among businesses can take

INSIGHT ON BUSINESS
WALMART DEVELOPS A PRIVATE INDUSTRIAL 
NETWORK 
Walmart is a leader in the appli-
cation of information technology to 
coordinate its supply chain. Walmart’s 
supply chain is the secret sauce behind 
its claim of offering the lowest everyday 
prices. Walmart is able to make this promise 
because it has one of the most efficient B2B supply 
chains in the world. It also doesn’t hurt to be the 
largest purchaser of consumer goods in the world. 
With sales of $479 billion in 2015, Walmart has 
been able to use information technology to achieve 
a decisive cost advantage over competitors. As you 
might imagine, the world’s largest retailer also 
has the world’s largest supply chain, with more 
than 100,000 suppliers worldwide. In the United 
States, Walmart has more than 5,200 retail stores 
(including Sam’s Clubs). The larger stores stock as 
many as 200,000 different items. Internationally, 
Walmart has over 6,200 additional stores in 27 
countries, giving it a total of over 11,500. 
In the late 1980s, Walmart developed the 
beginnings of collaborative commerce using an 
EDI-based SCM system that required its large sup-
pliers to use Walmart’s proprietary EDI network 
to respond to orders from Walmart purchasing 
managers. In 1991, Walmart expanded the capa-
bilities of its EDI-based network by introducing 
Retail Link. This system connected Walmart’s larg-
est suppliers to Walmart’s own inventory manage-
ment system and required large suppliers to track 
actual sales by stores and to replenish supplies as 
dictated by demand and following rules imposed 
by Walmart. 
In 1997, Walmart moved Retail Link to an 
extranet that allowed suppliers to directly link 
over the Internet into Walmart’s inventory man-
agement system. In 2000, Walmart hired an out-
side firm to upgrade Retail Link from being a 
supply chain management tool toward a more col-
laborative forecasting, planning, and replenishment 
(CFPR) system. Using demand aggregation soft-
ware, Walmart purchasing agents were now able 
to aggregate demand from all of Walmart’s sepa-
rate stores in the United States into a single RFQ 
from suppliers. This gave Walmart tremendous 
clout with even the largest suppliers. The software 
helped Walmart ­purchasing agents select a winning 
bid and negotiate final contracts. In addition, the 
software enabled suppliers to immediately access 
information on inventories, purchase orders, invoice 
status, and sales forecasts, based on 104 weeks of 
data, with data available by item, by store, and by 
hour. The system did not require smaller ­supplier 
firms to adopt expensive EDI ­software solutions. 
Instead, they could use standard browsers and PCs 
loaded with free software from Walmart. In 2002, 
Walmart switched to an entirely Internet-based 
version of EDI, and the result was a radical reduc-
tion in communications costs. 
Beginning in 2012, and continuing through 
2015, Walmart began a transition to a new supply 
and inventory management platform called Retail 
Link 2.0 or Global Replenishment System (GRS). 
It has currently been deployed to about 80 vendors, 
with the goal to bring all vendors on board by the 
end of 2015, and close down the existing Retail 
Link by 2018. Retail Link 2.0 has all the func-
tionality of the first Retail Link and builds on that 
foundation with real-time, online data and analyt-
ics that is available over the Web to vendors and 
employees. 
Retail Link 2.0 uses Microsoft SharePoint, 
which is a collaborative web-based collection of 
software services that can store and share docu-
ments, keep track of changes, and provide corpo-
rate search and enterprise social networking tools 

808

to connect employees with one another. 
SharePoint is integrated with Office 365. In 
Walmart’s Retail Link 2.0, the SharePoint plat-
form is used to create an online web-based facil-
ity that enables vendors to respond to orders, track 
shipments, and sales in a near-real time manner. 
Vendors and Walmart managers can use busi-
ness intelligence tools to predict sales rather than 
simply react to empty shelves or low inventory. 
The transition to Retail Link 2.0 requires a 
massive retraining effort for Walmart’s 100,000 
suppliers, and tens of thousands of Walmart man-
agers. Problems have developed in the supply chain 
as the number of new products in stores has mush-
roomed. Without a history of sales that can be used 
to predict future sales, some stores have too much 
inventory, and others not enough. 
Despite its success in building a world-class 
supply chain to support its retail stores, Walmart 
was not well prepared to deal with online sales 
or to compete with the online champion, Amazon. 
From the beginning, Walmart separated out its 
fledgling e-commerce operation as a separate 
company with a much lower priority for invest-
ment than its physical stores. It was late to invest 
in an Internet supply chain because the separate 
companies could never agree on whether it was a 
good investment. As a result, Walmart’s Internet 
supply chain remains a work in progress, relying 
on employees at some of the stores to pick online 
orders and ship from the store, while other orders 
are handled by a few Internet order warehouses. 
In 2015, Walmart had $13.7 billion in online sales 
(up 12%) (compared to Amazon’s $107 billion), 
representing only about 3% of its $479 billion in 
sales. In 2013, Walmart finally began creating a 
new inventory and logistics system that will com-
bine the inventory information from its stores and 
warehouses and then decide the most efficient way 
to pick and ship online orders. In 2016, Walmart 
customers can pick up grocery orders placed online 
at 150 locations. In the works: using drones in its 
large distribution centers to speed up fulfillment 
of online orders.
Like other large global firms, Walmart’s 
global supply chain has been criticized for exploit-
ing labor in underdeveloped countries where 
it buys products and in home markets where it 
sells them, bribing officials to look the other way, 
destroying environments, and wasting energy. In 
response to critics, Walmart has taken a number 
of steps. Walmart has set a goal of reducing carbon 
emissions in its supply chain by 20 million metric 
tons by 2015, and a goal of 100% renewable 
energy use in the United States. Walmart has 
made less progress in its labor policies: In 2012, 
the ABP pension fund blacklisted Walmart for 
failing to comply with the United Nations’ Global 
Compact principles that include a set of core 
values relating to human rights, labor standards, 
the environment, and anti-corruption efforts. In 
2014, the National Labor Relations Board issued 
a complaint against Walmart claiming that it had 
illegally retaliated against workers who took part 
in protests about working conditions and a U.S. 
Department of Justice investigation into alle-
gations that Walmart bribed Mexican officials 
to expand its stores and supply chain in Mexico 
remains ongoing. In 2015, to counter critics of its 
labor policies, Walmart launched a billion dollar 
program to raise wages, improve health care poli-
cies, and improve scheduling for work.

many forms and involve a wide range of activities—from simple supply chain manage-
ment to coordinating market feedback to designers at supply firms (see Figure 12.15).
One form of collaboration—and perhaps the most profound—is industry-wide 
collaborative resource planning, forecasting, and replenishment (CPFR), which 
involves working with network members to forecast demand, develop production 
plans, and coordinate shipping, warehousing, and stocking activities to ensure that 
retail and wholesale shelf space is replenished with just the right amount of goods. If 
this goal is achieved, hundreds of millions of dollars of excess inventory and capacity 
could be wrung out of an industry. This activity alone is likely to produce the largest 
benefits and justify the cost of developing private industrial networks.
A second area of collaboration is demand chain visibility. In the past, it was 
­impossible to know where excess capacity or supplies existed in the supply and 
­distribution chains. For instance, retailers might have significantly overstocked shelves, 
but suppliers and manufacturers—not knowing this—might be building excess capac-
ity or supplies for even more production. These excess inventories would raise costs 
for the entire industry and create extraordinary pressures to discount merchandise, 
reducing profits for everyone.
A third area of collaboration is marketing coordination and product design. Manu-
facturers that use or produce highly engineered parts use private industrial networks 
collaborative resource 
planning, forecasting, 
and replenishment 
(CPFR)
involves working with 
network members to 
forecast demand, develop 
production plans, and 
coordinate shipping, 
warehousing, and stocking 
activities to ensure that 
retail and wholesale shelf 
space is replenished with 
just the right amount of 
goods

PIECES OF THE COLLABORATIVE COMMERCE PUZZLE
Collaborative commerce involves many cooperative activities among supply and sales firms closely 
interacting with a single large firm through a private industrial network.

to coordinate both their internal design and marketing activities, as well as related 
activities of their supply and distribution chain partners. By involving their suppliers 
in product design and marketing initiatives, manufacturing firms can ensure that the 
parts produced actually fulfill the claims of marketers. On the reverse flow, feedback 
from customers can be used by marketers to speak directly to product designers at the 
firm and its suppliers. For the first time, closed loop marketing (customer feedback 
directly impacting design and production) can become a reality.
IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS
Although private industrial networks represent a large part of the future of B2B, there 
are many barriers to its complete implementation. Participating firms are required 
to share sensitive data with their business partners, up and down the supply chain. 
What in the past was considered proprietary and secret must now be shared. In a 
digital environment, it can be difficult to control the limits of information sharing. 
Information a firm freely gives to its largest customer may end up being shared with 
its closest competitor.
Integrating private industrial networks into existing enterprise systems and EDI 
networks poses a significant investment of time and money. The leading providers 
of enterprise systems to Fortune 500 companies (Oracle, IBM, and SAP) do offer 
B2B modules, and supply chain management capabilities, that can be added to their 
­existing software suites. Nevertheless, implementing these modules is a very expen-
sive proposition in part because the procurement side of many Fortune 500 firms is 
so fragmented and out-of-date. For smaller firms, cloud computing and software as a 
service (SaaS) alternatives are appearing on the market, which offer far less-expensive 
supply chain management capabilities.
Adopting private industrial networks also requires a change in mindset and behav-
ior for employees. Essentially, employees must shift their loyalties from the firm to the 
wider trans-organizational enterprise and recognize that their fate is intertwined with 
the fate of their suppliers and distributors. Suppliers in turn are required to change the 
way they manage and allocate their resources because their own production is tightly 
coupled with the demands of their private industrial network partners. All participants 
in the supply and distribution chains, with the exception of the large network owner, 
lose some of their independence, and must initiate large behavioral change programs 
in order to participate (Laudon and Laudon, 2016).

Cooperation, Collaboration, and Community
I
t may seem unusual to refer to an entire industry as a community, a word 
reserved typically for collections of people who more or less know one another. 
Trade associations are one example of an industrial community. Trade associa-
tions form in an effort to pursue the interests of all members in the community 
although usually they do not include customers in the community. Elemica is a B2B 
cloud-based, supply chain platform aiming to revolutionize the entire supply chain 
of the chemical, tire and rubber, energy, and other process industries worldwide. 
Elemica’s purpose is not just to foster cooperation on a one-to-one inter-firm basis, 
or just to foster collaboration on multi-firm projects, but instead to lift all boats on an 
industry tide by providing an inter-firm platform for communicating B2B informa-
tion, and thereby making all firms more efficient. Elemica calls itself a supply chain 
operating network ecosystem. Elemica is one of the few survivors of the early B2B 
e-commerce years. Elemica today processes approximately $400 billion in annual 
transactions across more than 7,500 process industry trading partners. Clients include 
BASF, BP, Continental, The Dow Chemical Company, DuPont, The Goodyear Tire & 
Rubber Company, LANXESS, Michelin, Shell, Solvay, Sumitomo Chemical, and Wacker. 
In terms of the framework we use to understand B2B Net marketplaces, Elemica can 
be characterized as an industry consortium. 
Elemica was founded by 22 leading corporations in the chemical industry (includ-
ing oil and industrial gases) to provide cloud-based order management and supply 
chain applications and services. A single platform provides one-stop shopping so that 
companies can buy and sell products to one another through their own enterprise 
systems or using a web alternative. It also helps companies automate all of their busi-
ness processes, creating efficiencies and economies of scale that lead to an improved 
bottom line. In 2016 Elemica was purchased by Thoma Bravo, a private equity firm. 
With additional capital resources, Elemica is planning to expand its trading ecosystem 
to a broader range of industries.
How does Elemica achieve community among a diverse, global collection of firms 
where firms are often both customers and vendors to one another? It unites commu-
nity members by linking together their enterprise systems. This is the “social glue” that 
sets Elemica apart. This “super platform” permits companies to communicate with one 
another and to conduct transactions, handle logistics, and keep the books. The Elemica 
commerce platform has effectively standardized industry business transactions for 
all network members regardless of the type of enterprise system they have, and it’s 
leveled the playing field for trade partners who are less technically sophisticated. This 
neutral platform facilitates millions of transactions for industry suppliers, customers,

and third-party providers. In this sense, Elemica is one of the most sophisticated 
technology platforms in the B2B space.
One of the largest investments for a company is its enterprise system. Despite 
these investments, intercompany relationships—the backbone of its supply chain—are 
often left to outdated and unreliable processes. These shortcomings cost billions in lost 
productivity, revenue, and profit. Elemica’s eCommerce platform changes that. It helps 
its clients leverage their enterprise system investment by incorporating transactions 
to external trade partners. Elemica’s QuickLink ERP connectivity enables companies 
to link their internal IT systems through a neutral platform so that information is 
moved into each company’s database while maintaining confidentiality and security. 
The chemical and oil industries were among the first users of enterprise systems 
(referred to in the early years as manufacturing resource planning systems). These 
large-scale systems were developed by single firms in order to rationalize and control 
the manufacturing process. They achieved this objective by identifying the outputs, 
inputs, and processes involved in manufacturing and automating key elements includ-
ing inventory control and planning, process control, warehousing and storage, and 
shipping/logistics. If a company needed to produce 10 tons of polyethylene plastic, 
its enterprise system could tell it precisely how many tons of petrochemical inputs 
were required, when they should be delivered to manufacturing, the machinery and 
labor force required to manufacture the product, how long it would take, where it 
would be stored, and sometimes how it would be shipped. The systems can estimate 
the cost at any stage.
Elemica facilitates transactions of all types including order processing and 
billing, and logistics management. However, unlike some other companies in the 
field, Elemica does not buy, sell, or own raw material products. Instead it acts as an 
intermediary, or network, linking companies together to automate confidential trans-
actions. Like eBay or a credit card company, Elemica’s revenue comes from charging 
transaction fees on a per-transaction basis. Its network of clients opens the door for 
companies to do business with all other connected buyers and sellers.
Elemica offers a variety of services for suppliers, customers, and logistic partners, 
enabling them to automate both their business processes and internal purchasing. A 
modular, cloud-based solution simplifies sales, procurement, and financial processes; 
integrates supply chain partners to diminish communication barriers; and reduces 
overhead and errors.
Elemica integrates information flow among global trading partners using a cloud-
based business process network called the QuickLink network. This is often referred to 
as platform as a service (PaaS). Each client needs only a single connection to Elemica, 
and Elemica manages the connections to that company’s external trade partners. 
That means a company needs only maintain one connection to Elemica (important 
when it’s time for enterprise system maintenance or upgrade) rather than maintain 
a variable number of connections and infrastructure to all its trade partners. Once 
a company connects to Elemica, it can have access to thousands of other trading 
partners, including suppliers, customers, and logistics firms. Clients are charged for 
the service based on volume of usage. This is much more efficient than older EDI

solutions to inter-company transactions. Elemica provides the platform for collabora-
tive commerce through a fully automated integrated network of suppliers, customers, 
and third-party providers.
Elemica offers cloud-based solutions for four areas: Logistics Management, Cus-
tomer Management, Supplier Management, and Sourcing Management. Using these 
solutions, companies can automate ordering, invoicing, shipment tracking, and day-to-
day business operations. Companies can sign up for one or more solutions depending 
on their needs. The software applications are software as a service (SaaS) applications 
residing on Elemica cloud servers, and therefore do not require participating firms 
to buy any hardware or software. Firms are charged on the basis of how much of the 
service they use, on a demand basis. 
Here’s an example of how Elemica works. Let’s say you need to order vinyl acetate 
from one of your suppliers. You put the order into your internal enterprise system, 
the order is automatically routed to Elemica’s QuickLink network, Elemica routes the 
order to your supplier’s internal enterprise system, and you get a confirmed receipt 
of the order. Elemica’s QuickLink Network ensures the accuracy of the item number 
and purchase order number and sends an alert if there’s an issue. Once an order is 
confirmed, Elemica’s platform can be leveraged to plan and coordinate delivery and 
automatically send an invoice and submit payment. For small or medium firms that 
may not have an enterprise system, Elemica has a web portal with online software 
that allows firms to participate in the community with suppliers and customers. The 
platform offers a closed-loop process, end to end, from the purchase order, to acknowl-
edgments, load tenders and responses, carrier status updates, and dock scheduling. 
All of this takes place in a few seconds with little or no human intervention. Elemica 
has even developed a solution that allows a customer to send a purchase order via 
e-mail or a print driver (alleviating fax processes) that is then routed to Elemica. The 
company then routes it to the supplier in its preferred format, integrated with its 
enterprise system as though it were a true electronic order. This holistic approach to 
order management allows suppliers to automate the process with both strategic and 
core customers, without asking its customers to change their processes. It’s a win-win 
situation for suppliers and customers. Elemica’s QuickLink Network is sometimes 
referred to as “Come As You Are” network because it allows firms to use whatever com-
munication tools they currently use, such as EDI, XML, and even e-mail, or formats 
associated with their enterprise systems. 
Unlike the automobile industry or the airline industry, where a few companies 
dominate, the $5 trillion global chemical industry is made up of many companies of 
all sizes. In addition, unlike many other industries, chemical companies often buy 
the output from other chemical companies to use as raw materials for their products. 
Thus, chemical companies are often customers of one another as well as competitors.
Senior leaders at some of the larger chemical companies were aware of changes 
in technology that made the adoption of information technology and the tools of 
e-commerce more appealing. The questions were how to best use these advances 
to benefit their businesses and how to establish industry standards for electronic 
transactions to make them accessible and attainable for all. Leaders from companies

such as Dow Chemical and DuPont began discussing this subject and determined 
that a cooperative alliance would be the most efficient way to move forward. They 
were met with initial skepticism by marketing and sales staff, worried that online 
procurement would negatively affect relationships. Further, senior corporate leader-
ship wasn’t sure that e-commerce would have any use in the chemical industry at all. 
And companies were cautious about the expense of investing in the infrastructure 
necessary for e-commerce.
However, there were compelling opportunities that were impossible to dismiss, 
including lowering costs, creating closer connections with customers and suppliers, 
and differentiating companies on something other than price. At the same time, new 
startups like e-Chemicals and PlasticsNet were making traditional chemical companies 
nervous. What would happen if their efforts to use information technology to stream-
line an inefficient supply chain helped them capture market share? In other words, 
if the more traditional companies didn’t move forward, they might end up losing the 
revenue race.
When Dow began looking at startups that were using e-commerce and talking to 
their customers, they found that customers were concerned about making an invest-
ment to establish online connections with multiple firms. Dow and DuPont decided 
that the best and most economically efficient option was to offer customers the choice 
of a neutral one-to-one link. This would remove the obstacle of multiple connections. 
A strong, third-party network addressed the community concern about loss of control. 
The two companies decided to create and invest in a neutral e-commerce company, 
partnering with other companies to create the critical mass needed to make it viable.
In 1999, the corporate boards of Dow and DuPont agreed that there were major 
advantages to online transaction processing and additional online connections among 
buyers and sellers. Because time and cost considerations made multiple connections 
unattractive to customers, a hub concept was adopted. It was also decided that a 
neutral community was the best approach.
All participants shared the common goal of creating a neutral platform to facilitate 
inter-company transactions and enhance business processes. Dow and DuPont also 
reviewed the concept with the relevant regulatory agencies and received up-front 
approval. Ultimately, 22 global chemical companies were involved in the launch of 
Elemica.
When Elemica opened its doors in 1999, there were around 50 startup B2B e-com-
merce companies in the chemical industry. Nearly all of these B2B companies were 
third-party-owned Net marketplaces suitable at best for short-term sourcing of some 
direct inputs. In 2016, only a handful of these Net marketplaces for the chemical 
industry remain. Elemica focuses on building longer-term business relationships by 
creating committed and contractual supply chains. The company acts only as a facili-
tator of business transactions and does not directly buy and sell chemical products.
Elemica’s business model has been successful primarily because it addresses the 
needs of chemical, tire and rubber, energy, and selected process companies of all sizes. 
It does this by offering multiple options for connecting to its hub system, multiple 
products that can be used alone or in combination, and by ensuring that only one

connection integrated with a client’s enterprise system is needed for all transactions. 
Customers can use Elemica, and take advantage of the technology it offers, without 
purchasing an additional internal system.
With Elemica, companies benefit from improved operational efficiency, reduced 
costs due to elimination of redundant systems and excess inventory, and a much 
higher percentage of safe and reliable deliveries. The flexibility of Elemica’s solu-
tions and network combines simplification, standardization, and efficiency. And 
clients have increased their profitability and improved cash flow through faster 
payment.
A number of very large companies use Elemica’s platform. In Europe, Shell 
Oil started using Elemica after recognizing that it had ongoing problems with the 
coordination of paperwork processing and deliveries. Truck drivers would arrive at 
delivery sites and wait up to two hours while paperwork was filled out. These delays 
were costing Shell money. Once Shell began using Elemica, things improved. Today, 
paperwork is processed 24 hours a day, and truck waiting time has been cut from an 
average of two hours to an average of 15 minutes. Given this success, Shell continues 
to expand its relationship with Elemica.
Dow Chemical began to transition to full procurement automation with Elemica 
in 2007. More than 300 of their MRO suppliers are now linked to Elemica’s platform. 
Errors are down 75%, and Dow has achieved economies of scale that have led to 
meaningful financial savings. Elemica helped Dow unify multiple, disparate business 
processes, reduced the cost of getting contracted items from suppliers, and increased 
efficiency in procurement, operations, IT, and accounts payable.
Air Products & Chemicals, Inc. is a global provider of gases and chemicals with 
22,000 employees worldwide, and $10 billion in revenue. A major customer asked them 
for online ordering, but the initial method proposed would have required considerable 
additional work for both parties. Because both companies were connected to Elemica, 
there was a better option—the Elemica Supply Chain Hosted Solution.
Elemica has also developed a sustainability program. In 2015, Elemica received 
the Food Logistics 2015 Top Green Provider Award for its efforts in promoting sus-
tainable supply chains. Elemica automated all inbound and outbound invoices for a 
global chemical company, eliminating over one million paper invoices. Elemica also 
eliminated the costs of archiving and storing paper records, saving additional costs.
Elemica has added social tools to its Supply Chain Operating Network (SCON). 
The idea is to give clients the ability to discover, create, and build social business 
networks—just as Facebook provides its users the ability to build online social net-
works. SCON provides its clients with a cloud-based network for establishing business 
relationships and SaaS (software as a service) applications to carry on trading once the 
relationship is established. Instead of creating hundreds of one-to-one EDI connections 
with partners, and then building their own software applications, firms can now more 
easily just connect to the network and find all the tools they need to trade with many 
partners. And in May 2014, Elemica introduced its Process Control Tower, a graphical 
interface that offers a consolidated view of transactional data across all a customer’s 
business partners. Based on the metaphor of an airport control tower, the idea is to

give managers a near real-time view of their entire supply and logistics systems. In 
the past, and still in many firms today, this kind of supply chain information comes 
in many different forms, from faxes, to e-mails, spreadsheets, and EDI messages. The 
Control Tower eliminates these difficult-to-interpret messages, and greatly enhances 
supply chain visibility.
Case Study Questions
1.	 If you were a small chemical company, what concerns would you have about 
joining Elemica?
2.	 Elemica provides a community for participants where they can transact, coordi-
nate, and cooperate to produce products for less. Yet these firms also compete 
with one another when they sell chemicals to end-user firms in the automobile, 
airline, and manufacturing industries. How is this possible?
3.	 How does the purchase of Elemica by Thoma Bravo, a private equity firm, change 
how Elemica fits into the B2B framework illustrated in Figure 12.9?  
	12.7	 REVIEW
K E Y  C O N C E P T S
Discuss the evolution and growth of B2B e-commerce, as well as its potential benefits and challenges.
•	
Before the Internet, business-to-business transactions were referred to simply as inter-firm trade or the 
procurement process. Today, we use the term B2B commerce to describe all types of inter-firm trade to 
exchange value across organizational boundaries, involving both the buying of inputs and the marketing, 
selling, and distribution of products and services, and the term B2B e-commerce to describe specifically 
that portion of B2B commerce that is enabled by the Internet and mobile apps. 
•	
In order to understand the evolution of B2B e-commerce, you must understand several key stages:
•	
Automated order entry systems, developed in the 1970s, involved the use of telephone modems to 
send digital orders. 
•	
EDI or electronic data interchange, developed in the late 1970s, is a communications standard for shar-
ing various procurement documents including invoices, purchase orders, shipping bills, product 
stocking numbers (SKUs), and settlement information for an industry. 
•	
B2B e-commerce websites emerged in the 1990s along with the commercialization of the Internet. 
They are online catalogs containing the products that are made available to the general public by a 
single vendor.
•	
Net marketplaces emerged in the late 1990s as a natural extension and scaling-up of the electronic 
storefront. Net marketplaces involve the marketing, selling, and distribution side of B2B e-com-
merce.  The essential characteristic of all Net marketplaces is that they bring hundreds of suppliers, 
each with its own online catalog, together with potentially thousands of purchasing firms to form a 
single ­Internet-based marketplace.

•	
Private industrial networks also emerged in the late 1990s with the commercialization of the Internet 
as a natural extension of EDI systems and the existing close relationships that developed between 
large industrial firms and their ­suppliers.
•	
Potential benefits of B2B e-commerce include lower administrative costs; lower search costs for buyers; 
reduced inventory costs; lower transaction costs; improved quality of products; decreased product cycle 
time; increased opportunities for collaborating with suppliers and distributors; greater price transparency; 
and increased visibility and real-time information sharing among all participants in the supply chain 
network.
•	
Potential risks and challenges include lack of real-time data, environmental impacts, natural disasters, 
labor concerns, and the impacts of economic, financial, and political instability.
Understand how procurement and supply chains relate to B2B e-commerce.
•	
The procurement process refers to the way business firms purchase the goods they need in order to pro-
duce the goods they will ultimately sell to consumers. Firms purchase goods from a set of suppliers who 
in turn purchase their inputs from a set of suppliers. These firms are linked in a series of connected 
­transactions. The supply chain is the series of transactions that links sets of firms that do ­business with 
each other. It includes not only the firms themselves but also the relationships between them and the 
processes that connect them.
•	
There are two different types of procurements (purchases of direct goods and purchases of indirect 
goods) and two different methods of purchasing goods (contract purchases and spot purchases).
•	
The term multi-tier supply chain is used to describe the complex series of transactions that exists between 
a single firm with multiple primary suppliers, the secondary suppliers who do business with those pri-
mary suppliers, and the tertiary suppliers who do business with the secondary suppliers.
Identify major trends in supply chain management and collaborative commerce. 
•	
Supply chain management (SCM) refers to a wide variety of activities that firms and industries use to coor-
dinate the key players in their procurement process. 
•	
Just-in-time production is a method of inventory cost management that seeks to eliminate excess inventory 
to a bare minimum.
•	
Lean production is a set of production methods and tools that focuses on the elimination of waste through-
out the customer value chain. 
•	
Supply chain simplification involves reducing the size of the supply chain and working more closely with a 
smaller group of strategic supplier firms to reduce both product costs and administrative costs, while 
improving quality
•	
Adaptive supply chains allow companies to react to disruptions in the supply chain in a particular region 
by moving production to a different region.
•	
Accountable supply chains are those where the labor conditions in low-wage, underdeveloped producer 
countries are visible and morally acceptable to ultimate consumers in more developed industrial societ-
ies.
•	
Sustainable supply chains involve using the most efficient environment-regarding means of production, 
distribution, and logistics.
•	
EDI remains very important in B2B e-commerce.
•	
Mobile B2B has become increasingly important in all aspects of B2B e-commerce, through all steps of the 
procurement process and throughout the supply chain.
•	
Cloud-based B2B systems shift much of the expense of B2B systems from the firm to a B2B network pro-
vider, sometimes called a data hub or B2B platform.

•	
Contemporary supply chain management (SCM) systems are based on supply chain simplification, just in 
time and lean production, focusing on strategic partners in the production process, enterprise systems, 
and continuous inventory replenishment.
•	
Collaborative commerce involves the use of digital technologies to permit firms to collaboratively design, 
develop, build, market, and manage products through their life cycles, and is a direct extension of supply 
chain management systems, as well as supply chain simplification. Collaborative commerce today 
involves cloud servers, social business tools, and mobile devices.
•	
Social networks are providing intimate connections among customers, suppliers, and logistics partners.
•	
Despite the size of the B2B e-commerce, B2B marketing still accounts for onlya relatively small slice of 
the total amount spent on digital marketing and advertising, in part due to the slow pace of technological 
change in supply chain and procurement management and in part due to the very different nature of B2B 
e-commerce compared to B2C e-commerce. For long-term sourcing, Interpersonal relationships, network-
ing, brand, and informative content marketing using white papers, videos, podcasts, webinars, blogs, 
e-books, conferences, and professional associations are the primary and most effective marketing tools. 
However, in spot purchasing markets,  B2B marketing uses many of the same marketing tactics and tools 
found in B2C marketing: display ads, search engine marketing, websites, social network channels, videos, 
and mobile ads.
Understand the different characteristics and types of Net marketplaces.
•	
Net marketplaces are sell-side digital environments where sellers and buyers are brought together. 
•	
Characteristics of Net marketplaces include their bias (seller-side vs. buy-side vs. neutral), ownership 
(industry vs. third party), pricing mechanism (fixed priced catalogs, auctions, and RFPs/RFQs), scope/
focus (horizontal vs. vertical), value creation (customers/suppliers), and access to markets (public vs. 
private).
•	
There are four main types of “pure” Net marketplaces:
•	
E-distributors are independently owned intermediaries that offer industrial ­customers a single source 
from which to make spot purchases of indirect or MRO goods. E-distributors operate in a horizontal 
market that serves many different industries with products from many different suppliers.
•	
E-procurement Net marketplaces are independently owned intermediaries ­connecting hundreds of 
online suppliers offering millions of MRO goods to ­business firms who pay a fee to join the market. 
E-procurement Net marketplaces operate in a horizontal market in which long-term contractual 
purchasing agreements are used to buy indirect goods.
•	
Exchanges are independently owned online marketplaces that connect hundreds to thousands of sup-
pliers and buyers in a dynamic real-time environment. They are typically vertical markets in which 
spot purchases can be made for direct inputs (both goods and services). Exchanges make money by 
charging a commission on each transaction.
•	
Industry consortia are industry-owned vertical markets where long-term contractual purchases of 
direct inputs can be made from a limited set of invited participants. Consortia serve to reduce supply 
chain inefficiencies by unifying the supply chain for an industry through a common network and 
computing platform.
Understand the objectives of private industrial networks, their role in supporting collaborative commerce, and the 
barriers to their implementation.
•	
Objectives of private industrial networks include developing efficient purchasing and selling business 
processes industry-wide; developing industry-wide resource planning to supplement enterprise-wide 
resource planning; increasing supply chain visibility; achieving closer buyer-supplier relationships; oper-
ating on a global scale; and reducing industry risk by preventing imbalances of supply and demand.
•	
Private industrial networks are transforming the supply chain by focusing on continuous business pro-
cess coordination between companies. This coordination includes much more than just transaction sup-

	
R e v i e w

port and supply chain management. Product design, demand forecasting, asset management, and sales 
and marketing plans can all be coordinated among network members. Some of the forms of collaboration 
used by private industrial networks include the following:
•	
CPFR or industry-wide collaborative resource planning, forecasting, and replenishment involves working 
with network members to forecast demand, develop production plans, and coordinate shipping, 
warehousing, and stocking activities. 
•	
Supply chain and distribution chain visibility refers to the fact that, in the past, it was impossible to 
know where excess capacity existed in a supply or distribution chain. Eliminating excess inventories 
by halting the production of overstocked goods can raise the profit margins for all network members 
because products will no longer need to be discounted in order to move them off the shelves.
•	
Marketing and product design collaboration can be used to involve a firm’s suppliers in product design 
and marketing activities as well as in the related activities of their supply and distribution chain 
partners. This can ensure that the parts used to build a product live up to the claims of the market-
ers. Collaborative commerce applications used in a private industrial network can also make pos-
sible closed-loop marketing in which customer feedback will directly impact product design.

	 1.	 Choose an industry and a B2B vertical market maker that interests you. Investigate the site and prepare 
a report that describes the size of the industry served, the type of Net marketplace provided, the benefits 
promised by the site for both suppliers and purchasers, and the history of the company. You might 
also investigate the bias (buyer versus seller), ownership (suppliers, buyers, independents), pricing 
mechanism(s), scope and focus, and access (public versus private) of the Net marketplace.
	 2.	 Examine the website of one of the e-distributors listed in Figure 12.9, and compare and contrast it to one 
of the websites listed for e-procurement Net marketplaces. If you were a business manager of a medium-
sized firm, how would you decide where to purchase your indirect inputs—from an e-distributor or an 
e-procurement Net marketplace? Write a short report detailing your analysis.
	 3.	 Assume you are a procurement officer for an office furniture manufacturer of steel office equipment. 
You have a single factory located in the Midwest with 2,000 employees. You sell about 40% of your office 
furniture to retail-oriented catalog outlets such as Quill in response to specific customer orders, and the 
remainder of your output is sold to resellers under long-term contracts. You have a choice of purchasing 
raw steel inputs—mostly cold-rolled sheet steel—from an exchange and/or from an industry consortium. 
Which alternative would you choose and why? Prepare a presentation for management supporting your 
position.
	 4.	 You are involved in logistics management for your company, a national retailer of office furniture. In 
the last year the company has experienced a number of disruptions in its supply chain as vendors failed 
to deliver products on time, and the business has lost customers as a result. Your firm only has a limited 
IT department, and you would like to propose a cloud-based solution. Go to the website of GT Nexus. 
Explore the Why GT Nexus tab, and the Solutions By Industry/Retail tab. Read several case studies on 
the site. Write a report to senior management why you believe that a cloud-based B2B solution is best for 
your firm.
