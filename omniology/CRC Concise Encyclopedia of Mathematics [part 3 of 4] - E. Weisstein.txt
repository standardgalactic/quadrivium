TRIPLE 
SYSTEMS 
of order 3 and 9 are Kirkman 
triple 
systems 
with 12 = 0 and 1. Solution 
to KIRKMAN'S 
SCHOOLGIRL 
PROBLEM 
requires 
construction 
of a Kirk- 
man 
triple 
system 
of order 
n = 2. 
Ray-Chaudhuri 
and Wilson 
(1971) 
showed that 
there ex- 
ists at least one Kirkman 
triple 
system 
for every 
NON- 
NEGATIVE 
order 
n. 
Earlier 
editions 
of Ball 
and 
Cox- 
eter (1987) 
gave constructions 
of Kirkman 
triple 
systems 
with 
9 5 w 5 99. For n = 1, there 
is a single 
unique 
(up 
to an isomorphism) 
solution, 
while 
there 
are 7 different 
systems 
for n = 2 (Mulder 
1917, 
Cole 
1922, 
Ball 
and 
Coxeter 
1987).

Kissing 
Number 
The number 
of equivalent 
HYPERSPHERES 
in n-D which 
can touch 
an equivalent 
HYPERSPHERE 
without 
any in- 
tersections, 
also sometimes 
called 
the 
NEWTON 
NUM- 
BER, CONTACT 
NUMBER, 
COORDINATION 
NUMBI~R,~~ 
LIGANCY. 
Newton 
correctly 
believed 
that 
the kissing 
number 
in 3-D was 12, but the first proofs 
were not pro- 
duced 
until 
the 19th century 
(Conway 
and Sloane 
1993, 
p. 21) by Bender 
(1874), 
Hoppe 
(1874), 
and 
Giinther 
(1875). 
More 
concise 
proofs 
were published 
by Schiitte 
and van der Waerden 
(1953) 
and Leech 
(1956). 
Exact 
values 
for lattice 
pacbings 
are known 
for n = 1 to 9 and 
n = 24 (Conway 
and Sloane 
1992, 
Sloane 
and 
Nebe). 
Odlyzko 
and 
Sloane 
(1979) 
found 
the 
exact 
value 
for 
24-D. 
The following 
table 
gives the largest 
known 
kissing 
num- 
bers in DIMENSION 
D for lattice 
(L) and nonlattice 
(NL) 
packings 
(if a nonlattice 
packing 
with 
higher 
number 
ex- 
ists) . In nonlattice 
packings, 
the 
kissing 
number 
may 
vary from 
sphere to sphere, 
so the largest 
value 
is given 
below 
(Conway 
and Sloane 
1993, p. 15). An more 
exten- 
sive and up-to-date 
tabulation 
is maintained 
by Sloane 
and Nebe.

Klein-Beltrami 
Model 
The 
Klein-Beltrami 
model 
of HYPERBOLIC 
GEOMETRY 
consists 
of an OPEN 
DISK 
in the Euclidean 
plane 
whose 
open 
chords 
correspond 
to hyperbolic 
lines. 
Two lines I 
and m are then 
considered 
parallel 
if their 
chords fail to 
intersect 
and are PERPENDICULAR 
under 
the following 
conditions, 
1. If at least one of 2 and nz is a diameter 
of the DISK, 
they 
are hyperbolically 
perpendicular 
IFF they 
are 
perpendicular 
in the Euclidean 
sense. 
2. If neither 
is a diameter, 
2 is perpendicular 
to vt IFF 
the Euclidean 
line 
extending 
I passes through 
the 
pole of m (defined 
as the point 
of intersection 
of the 
tangents 
to the disk at the 
“endpoints” 
of m). 
There 
is an isomorphism 
between 
the POINCAR~ 
HY- 
PERBOLIC 
DISK 
model 
and 
the 
Klein-Beltrami 
model. 
Consider 
a Klein 
disk 
in 
Euclidean 
3-space 
with 
a 
SPHERE 
of the same radius 
seated 
atop it, tangent 
at the 
ORIGIN. 
If we now project 
chords 
on the disk 
orthog- 
onally 
upward 
onto 
the 
SPHERE'S 
lower 
HEMISPHERE, 
they become 
arcs of CIRCLES 
orthogonal 
to the equator. 
If we then 
stereographically 
project 
the SPHERE'S 
lower 
HEMISPHERE 
back onto the plane 
of the Klein 
disk from 
the north 
pole, 
the equator 
will 
map 
onto 
a disk some- 
what 
larger 
than 
the Klein 
disk, 
and the chords 
of the 
original 
Klein 
disk will 
now be arcs of CIRCLES 
orthog- 
onal 
to this 
larger 
disk. 
That 
is, they 
will 
be Poincare 
lines. 
Now we can say that 
two Klein 
lines or angles 
are 
congruent 
iff their 
corresponding 
Poincark 
lines and an- 
gles under 
this 
isomorphism 
are congruent 
in the sense 
of the Poincarh 
model.

It can be physically 
realized 
only 
in 4-D 
(since 
it must 
pass through 
itself 
without 
the presence 
of a HOLE). 
Its TOPOLOGY is equivalent 
to a pair 
of CROSS-CAPS 
with 
coinciding 
boundaries. 
It 
can be cut in half along 
its length 
to make 
two MOBIUS 
STRIPS. 
The above picture 
is an IMMERSION of the Klein 
bottle 
in 
Iw3 (3-space). 
There 
is also another 
possible 
IMMERSION 
called 
the 
“figure-8” 
IMMERSION (Geometry 
Center). 
The 
equation 
for the usual IMMERSION is given 
by the 
implicit 
equation 
(x” + y2 + z2 + 2y - l)[(z” 
+ y2 + z2 - 2y - l>” - 8z2] 
+162z(z2 
+ y2 + x2 - 2y - 1) = 0 
(1) 
(Stewart 
1991), 
Nordstrand 
gives the parametric 
form 
x = cos u[cos( $u)(Jz 
+ cos w) + sin( +) 
sinu cos v] 
(2) 
y = sinu[cos(+u)(fi 
+ cos w) + sin( $u) sin w cos w] 
(3) 
z = -sin(+)(JZ+ 
cosw) + cos(+) 
sinvcosv. 
(4) 
The 
“figure-8” 
form 
of the Klein 
bottle 
is obtained 
by 
rotating 
a figure eight 
about 
an axis while placing 
a twist 
in it, and is given 
by parametric 
equations 
x(u, w) = [a + cos( +) 
sin(w) - sin( +) 
sin(2w)] cos(u) 
(5) 
y(u, w) = [a + cos( $L) sin(w) - sin( $u) sin(2w)] sin(u) 
(6) 
4% 
4 = sin( +) 
sin(w) + cos( +u) sin(2w) 
(7) 
for u E [O, 2~), w E [0,2x), 
and a > 2 (Gray 
1993). 
The image 
of the CROSS-CAP map 
of a TORUS centered 
at the ORIGIN is a Klein 
bottle 
(Gray 
1993, p. 249). 
Any 
set of regions 
on the Klein 
bottle 
can be colored 
using 
ss colors only 
(Franklin 
1934,

1986).

Knapsack 
Problem 
Given 
a SUM and a set of WEIGHTS, 
find the WEIGHTS 
which 
were used to generate 
the 
SUM. 
The 
values 
of 
the weights 
are then 
encrypted 
in the sum. 
The 
system 
relies 
on the existence 
of a class of knapsack 
problems 
which can be solved trivially 
(those in which the weights 
are separated 
such that 
they can be “peeled 
off” one at 
a time 
using 
a GREEDY-like 
algorithm), 
and 
transfor- 
mations 
which 
convert 
the trivial 
problem 
to a difficult 
one and vice versa. 
Modular 
multiplication 
is used as 
the TRAPDOOR 
FUNCTION. 
The 
simple 
knapsack 
sys- 
tem was broken 
by Shamir 
in 1982, the Graham-Shamir 
system 
by Adleman, 
and the iterated

by Ernie 
Brickell 
in 1984.

Knights 
of the 
Round 
Table 
~~~NECKLACE 
Knight’s 
Tour 
A knight’s 
tour of a CHESSBOARD (or any other 
grid) 
is a sequence 
of moves 
by a knight 
CHESS piece 
(which 
may 
only 
make 
moves 
which 
simultaneously 
shift 
one 
square 
along 
one axis 
and 
two 
along 
the 
other) 
such 
that 
each square 
of the 
board 
is visited 
exactly 
once 
(i.e., 
a HAMILTONIAN 
CIRCUIT). 
If the final 
position 
is 
a knight’s 
move 
away from 
the first position, 
the tour 
is 
called 
re-entrant. 
The first figure 
above shows a knight’s 
tour 
on a 6 x 6 CHESSBOARD. The 
second set of figures 
shows six knight’s 
tours 
on an 8 x 8 CHESSBOARD, all 
but the first of which 
are re-entrant. 
The final 
tour 
has 
the additional 
property 
that 
it is a SEMIMAGIC SQUARE 
with 
row and column 
sums 
of 260 and 
main 
diagonal 
sums of 348 and 168, 
Lijbbing 
and 
Wegener 
(1996) 
computed 
the 
number 
of cycles 
covering 
the 
directed 
knight’s 
graph 
for an 
8 x 8 CHESSBOARD. 
They 
obtained 
a2, 
where 
a = 
2,849,759,680, 
i.e., 
8,121,130,233,753,702,400. 
They 
also computed 
the number 
of undirected 
tours, 
obtain- 
ing an incorrect 
answer 33,439,123,484,294 
(which 
is not 
divisible 
by 4 as it must 
be), and so are currently 
redoing 
the calculation. 
The following 
results 
are given 
by Kraitchik 
(1942). 
The 
number 
of possible 
tours 
on a 4k x 4k: board 
for k: = 3, 
4, 
. . . are 8, 0, 82, 744, 6378, 
31088, 
189688, 
1213112, 
. . . (Kraitchik 
1942, p. 263). 
There 
are 14 tours 
on the 
3 x 7 rectangle, 
two of which are symmetrical. 
There 
are 
376 tours on the 3 x 8 rectangle, 
none of which is closed, 
There 
are 16 symmetric 
tours 
on the 3 x 9 rectangle 
and 
8 closed 
tours 
on the 3 x 10 rectangle. 
There 
are 58 
symmetric 
tours 
on the 3 x 11 rectangle 
and 28 closed 
tours 
on the 3 x 12 rectangle. 
There 
are five doubly 
symmetric 
tours 
on the 
6 x 6 square. 
There 
are 1728 
tours 
on the 
5 x 5 square, 
8 of which 
are symmetric. 
The longest 
“uncrossed” 
knight’s 
tours on an n x n board 
for n 
= 
3, 
4, 
, . . are 2, 5, 10, 17, 24, 35, . . . (Sloane’s 
A003192).

Knot 
A knot 
is defined 
as a closed, 
non-self-intersecting 
curve 
embedded 
in 3-D. A knot 
is a single 
component 
LINK. 
Klein 
proved 
that 
knots 
cannot 
exist 
in 
an 
EVEN- 
numbered 
dimensional 
space 
2 
4. 
It 
has since 
been 
shown that 
a knot 
cannot 
exist 
in any dimension 
2 4. 
Two distinct 
knots 
cannot 
have the same 
KNOT 
COM- 
PLEMENT 
(Gordon 
and 
Luecke 
1989), 
but 
two LINKS 
can! 
(Adams 
1994, 
p. 261). 
The 
KNOT 
SUM 
of any 
number 
of knots 
cannot 
be the 
knot 
in the sum is the UNKNOT. 
UNKNOT 
unless 
each 
Knots 
can be cataloged 
based 
on the minimum 
num- 
ber of crossings 
present. 
Knots 
are usually 
further 
bro- 
ken down into 
PRIME 
KNOTS. 
Knot 
theory 
was 
given 
its first 
impetus 
when 
Lord 
Kelvin 
proposed 
a theory 
that 
atoms 
were vortex 
loops, 
with 
different 
chemical 
Knot 
elements 
consisting 
of different 
knotted 
configurations 
(Thompson 
1867). 
P. G. Tait 
then 
cataloged 
possible 
knots 
by trial 
and error. 
Thistlethwaite 
has used DOWKER 
NOTATION 
to enumer- 
ate the number 
of PRIME 
KNOTS 
of up to 13 crossings, 
and ALTERNATING 
KNOTS 
up 
to 14 crossings. 
In this 
compilation, 
MIRROR 
IMAGES 
are counted 
as a single 
knot 
type. 
The number 
of distinct 
PRIME 
KNOTS 
N(n) 
for knots 
from 
n = 3 to 13 crossings 
are 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 21, 
49, 165, 552, 2176, 9988 (Sloane’s 
A002863). 
Combining 
PRIME 
KNOTS 
gives one additional 
type of knot 
each for 
knots 
six and seven crossings. 
Let 
C(n) 
be the number 
of distinct 
PRIME 
KNOTS 
of 
rt crossings, 
counting 
CHIRAL 
versions 
of the same 
knot 
separately. 
Then 
1 
3 (2 n-2 - 1) < N(n) 
JS, en 
- 
(Ernst 
and Summers 
1987). 
Welsh 
has shown that 
the 
. 
number 
of knots 
is bounded 
by an exponential 
in n. 
A pictorial 
enumeration 
of PRIME 
KNOTS 
of up to 10 
crossings 
appears 
in Rolfsen 
(1976, 
Appendix 
C). Note, 
however, 
that 
in this 
table, 
the PERKO 
PAIR 
10161 and 
10162 are actually 
identical, 
and the uppermost 
crossing 
in 10144 should 
be changed 
(Jones 
1987). 
The 
&h 
knot 
having 
72 crossings 
in this 
(arbitrary) 
ordering 
of knots 
is given 
the symbol 
nk,. Another 
possible 
representation 
for knots 
uses the BRAID 
GROUP. 
A knot 
with 
n + 1 
crossings 
is a member 
of the BRAID 
GROUP 
n. 
There 
is no general 
method 
known 
for deciding 
whether 
two 
given 
knots 
are equivalent 
or interlocked. 
There 
is no 
general 
ALGORITHM 
to determine 
if a tangled 
curve is a 
knot. 
Haken 
(1961) 
has given 
an ALGORITHM, 
but it is 
too complex 
to apply 
to even simple 
cases. 
If a knot 
is AMPHICHIRAL, 
the 
“amphichirality” 
is A = 
1, otherwise 
A = 
0 (Jones 
1987). 
ARF 
INVARIANTS 
are designated 
a. BRAID 
WORDS 
are denoted 
b (Jones 
1987).

Adams

(although 
most

that

Linking 
In general, 
it is possible 
to link 
two n-D 
HYPERSPHERES 
in (n + 2)-D space in an infinite 
number 
of inequivalent 
ways. 
In dimensions 
greater 
than 
n + 2 in the piece- 
wise linear 
category, 
it is true 
that 
these 
spheres 
are 
themselves 
unknotted. 
However, 
they 
may 
still 
form 
nontrivial 
links. 
In 
this 
way, they 
are something 
like 
higher 
dimensional 
analogs 
of two l-spheres 
in 3-D. The 
following 
table 
gives the number 
of nontrivial 
ways that 
two n-D HYPERSPHERES can be linked 
in Jc-D.

then 
unlink 
in 17-D, 
link 
up again

consists 
of an “easy 
part” 
(Zeeman 
1962) and a “hard 
part” 
(Ravenel 
1986). 
The 
hard part is related 
to the calculation 
of the (stable

HOMOTOPY GROUPS of SPHERES.

Theory 
The 
mathematical 
study 
of KNOTS. Knot 
theory 
con- 
siders questions 
such as the following: 
1. Given 
a tangled 
loop 
of string, 
is it really 
knotted 
or 
can it, with enough 
ingenuity 
and/or 
luck, 
be untan- 
gled without 
having 
to cut it? 
2. More 
generally, 
given 
two tangled 
loops 
of string, 
when are they 
deformable 
into 
each other? 
3. Is there 
an effective 
algorithm 
(or any algorithm 
to 
speak of) to make 
these 
determinations? 
Although 
there 
has been almost 
explosive 
growth 
in the 
number 
of important 
results 
proved 
since 
the discov- 
ery of the JONES POLYNOMIAL, 
there 
are still 
many 
“knotty” 
problems 
and 
conjectures 
whose 
answers 
re- 
main 
unknown.

Koch 
Snowflake 
A FRACTAL, 
also known 
as the KOCH 
ISLAND, 
which was 
first described 
by Helge 
von Koch 
in 1904. It is built 
by 
startingwith 
~~EQUILATERAL 
TRIANGLE, 
removingthe 
inner 
third 
of each side, building 
another 
EQUILATERAL 
TRIANGLE at the location 
where the side was removed, 
and then 
repeating 
the process 
indefinitely. 
The 
Koch 
snowflake 
can be simply 
encoded 
as a LINDENMAYER 
SYSTEM withinitialstring 
'IF--F--F", 
STRING REWRIT- 
ING rule 
“F” 
-> "F+F--F+F", 
and angle 60”. 
The zeroth 
through 
third 
iterations 
of the construction 
are shown 
above. 
The fractal 
can also be constructed 
using 
a base 
curve and motif, 
illustrated 
below. 
Let 
iVn be the number 
of sides, 
L, 
be the length 
of a 
single 
side, tn. be the length 
of the PERIMETER, 
and A, 
the snowflake’s 
AREA after 
the nth 
iteration. 
Further, 
denote 
the AREA of the initial 
n = 0 TRIANGLE 
A, and 
the length 
of an initial 
n = 0 side 1. Then

Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser 
Theorem 
A theorem 
outlined 
in 1954 by Kolmogorov 
which 
was 
subsequently 
proved 
in the 
1960s by Arnold 
and Moser 
(Tabor 
1989, 
p. 105). 
It gives conditions 
under 
which 
CHAOS is restricted 
in extent. 
Moser’s 
1962 proof 
was 
valid 
for TWIST MAPS 
0’ = e + 2rf (I) + d&I) 
(1) 
I’ = I+f(W). 
(2) 
In 1963, Arnold 
produced 
a proof 
for Hamiltonian 
sys- 
tems 
H = Ho(I) 
+ E&(I). 
(3) 
The 
original 
theorem 
required 
perturbations 
E N 1W4*, 
although 
this 
has 
since 
been 
significantly 
increased. 
Arnold’s 
proof 
required 
C”, 
and Moser’s 
original 
proof 

1002 
Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser 
Theorem 
Kolmogorov-Sinai 
Entropy 
required 
C333. 
Subsequently, 
Moser’s 
version 
has been 
reduced 
to C6, 
then 
C’+‘, 
although 
counterexamples 
are known 
for C2. 
Conditions 
for applicability 
of the 
KAM 
theorem 
are:

Moser 
considered 
an integrable 
Hamiltonian 
function 
I& 
with 
a TORUS 
TO and set of frequencies 
w having 
an in- 
commensurate 
frequency 
vector 
W* (i.e., wok # 0 for all 
INTEGERS 
ki). 
Let 
HO be perturbed 
by some periodic 
function 
HI. 
The 
KAM 
theorem 
states 
that, 
if I& 
is 
small 
enough, 
then 
for almost 
every w* there 
exists 
an 
invariant 
TORUS 
T(w*) 
of the 
perturbed 
system 
such 
that 
T(w*) 
is “close 
to” 
To(w*). 
Moreover, 
the 
TORI 
T(w*) 
form 
a set of POSITIVE 
measures 
whose comple- 
ment 
has a measure 
which 
tends 
to zero as ]I&/ 
+ 
0. 
A useful 
paraphrase 
of the KAM 
theorem 
is, “For 
suf- 
ficiently 
small 
perturbation, 
almost 
all TORI 
(excluding 
those 
with 
rational 
frequency 
vectors) 
are preserved.” 
The 
theorem 
thus 
explicitly 
excludes 
TORI 
with 
ratio- 
nally 
related 
frequencies, 
that 
is, n - 1 conditions

Kuratowski’s 
Closure-Component 
Problem 
Let 
X be an arbitrary 
TOPOLOGICAL 
SPACE. Denote 
the CLOSURE of a SUBSET A of X by A- 
and the com- 
plement 
of A by A’. Then 
at most 
14 different 
SETS can 
be derived 
from 
A by repeated 
application 
of closure 
and 
complementation 
(Berman 
and Jordan 
1975, Fife 1991). 
The problem 
was first proved 
by Kuratowski 
(1922) 
and 
popularized 
by Kelley 
(1955).

Kurtosis 
The 
degree 
of peakedness 
of a distribution, 
also called 
the EXCESS or EXCESS COEFFICIENT. 
Kurtosis 
is de- 
noted 72 (or b2) or p2 and computed 
by taking 
the fourth 
MOMENT of a distribution. 
A distribution 
with 
a high 
peak 
(3”~ > 
0) is called 
LEPTOKURTIC, 
a flat-topped 
curve 
(72 < 0) is called 
PLATYKURTIC, 
and the normal 
distribution 
(72 = 0) is called 
MESOKURTIC. Let pi de-

Lagrange’s 
Four-Square 
Theorem 
A theorem 
also known 
as BACHET'S CONJECTURE which 
was stated 
but not proven 
by Diophantus. 
It states that 
every POSITIVE INTEGER can be written 
as the SUM 
of at most 
four SQVARES. Although 
the theorem 
was 
proved 
by Fermat 
using 
infinite 
descent, 
the proof 
was 
suppressed. 
Euler 
was unable 
to prove the theorem. 
The 
first published 
proof 
was given by Lagrange 
in 1770 and 
made use ofthe

Lagrange’s 
Group 
Theorem 
Also known 
as LAGRANGE'S LEMMA. 
If A is an ELE- 
MENT of a FINITE GROUP of order 
n, then 
A” = 1, This 
implies 
that 
eln where 
e is the smallest 
exponent 
such 
that 
Ae = 1. Stated 
another 
way, the ORDER of a SUB- 
GROUP divides 
the ORDER of the GROUP. The converse 
of Lagrange’s 
theorem 
is not, in general, 
true 
(Gallian 
1993, 1994).

Lame’ Curve 
Lam6 
Curve 
A curve with 
Cartesian 
equation 
first 
discussed 
in 1818 by Lam& 
If rt is a rational, 
then 
the 
curve 
is algebraic. 
However, 
for irrational 
n, the 
curve 
is transcendental. 
For EVEN 
INTEGERS 
n, the 
curve 
becomes 
closer to a rectangle 
as n increases. 
For 
ODD INTEGER 
values of n, the curve looks 
like the EVEN 
case in the 
POSITIVE 
quadrant 
but 
goes to infinity 
in 
both 
the 
second 
and fourth 
quadrants

N.B. 
A detailed 
on-line 
essay 
by S. Finch 
was 
the start- 
ing point 
for this 
entry. 
Let S(z) 
denote 
the number 
of POSITIVE 
INTEGERS 
nut 
exceeding 
2 which 
can be expressed 
as a sum 
of two 
squares, 
then

-S(x) 
= K, 
x-boo 
x 
(1) 
as proved 
by Landau 
(1908) 
and stated 
by Ramanujan. 
The value 
of K (also sometimes 
called 
A) is 
1 
- 1-qr2 = 0.764223653.v. 
(2) 
(Hardy 
1940, Berndt 
1994). 
Ramanujan 
found 
the ap- 
proximate 
value 
K = 0.764. 
Flajolet 
and Vardi 
(1996) 
give a beautiful

A FUNCTION $ which satisfies 
Laplace’s 
equation 
is said 
to be HARMONIC. A solution 
to Laplace’s 
equation 
has 
the property 
that 
the average 
value over a spherical 
sur- 
face is equal 
to the value 
at the center 
of the SPHERE 
(GAUSS'S HARMONIC FUNCTION THEOREM). Solutions 
have 
no local 
maxima 
or minima. 
Because 
Laplace’s 
equation 
is linear, 
the superposition 
of any two solutions 
is also a solution

Laplace 
Transform 
The 
Laplace 
transform 
is an INTEGRAL TRANSFORM 
perhaps 
second onlytothe 
FOURIER TRANSFORM inits 
utility 
in solving 
physical 
problems. 
Due 
to its useful 
properties, 
the Laplace 
transform 
is particularly 
useful 
in solving 
linear 
ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL 
EQUATIONS 
such as those arising 
in the analysis 
of electronic 
circuits. 
The 
(one-sided) 
Laplace 
transform 
C (not to be confused 
with 
the LIE DERIVATIVE) is defined 
by 
L(s) = L( f (t)) s

l=O

where 
f(t) 
is defined 
for t _> 0. 
A two-sided 
Laplace 
transform 
is sometimes 
also defined 
by 
L(s) 
= L(f(t)) 
= 
f (t)e-5t 
dt.

The

theorem 
states that,

on every finite 
interval 
in 
[0, 00) satisfying

(3) 
for all t f [O, oo), then 
L(f(t)) 
exists 
for all s > a. The 
Laplace

is also

sense that,

The Laplace 
transform 
has many 
important 
prop- 
erties. 
The 
Laplace 
transform 
of a CONVOLUTION 
is given 
by 
L(f(t) * SW = w W>Wt)) 
(8) 
L-‘(F(s)G(s)) 
= L-‘(F(s)) 
* L-‘@(s)). 
(9) 
NOW consider 
DIFFERENTIATION. 
Let 
f(t) 
be continu- 
ously 
differentiable 
n - 
1 times 
in [O,oo). 
If If(t)1

l - f’“-“(O). 
(10) 
This

(11) 
Continuing 
for higher 
order 
derivatives 
then 
gives 
qf”(t)] 
= s”qf(t)] 
- sf(O) - f’(o)* 
(12) 
This property 
can be used to transform 
differential 
equa- 
tions 
into algebraic 
equations, 
a procedure 
known 
as the 
HEAVISIDE 
CALCULUS, 
which can then be inverse 
trans- 
formed 
to obtain 
the solution. 
For example, 
applying 
the Laplace 
transform 
to the equation 
f”(t) +a1fl(t)+aof(t) 
= 0 
(13) 
gives

Large 
Number 
There 
are a wide variety 
of large 
numbers 
which 
crop 
up in mathematics. 
Some 
are contrived, 
but some actu- 
ally 
arise in proofs. 
Often, 
it is possible 
to prove 
exis- 
tence theorems 
by deriving 
some potentially 
huge upper 
limit 
which 
is frequently 
greatly 
reduced 
in subsequent 
versions 
(e.g., 
GRAHAM’S 
NUMBER, 
KOLMOGOROV- 
ARNOLD-MOSER 
THEOREM, MERTENS CONJECTURE, 
SKEWES NUMBER,~ANG'S 
CONJECTURE). 
Large 
decimal 
numbers 
beginning 
with 
10’ 
are named 
according 
to two mutually 
conflicting 
nomenclatures: 
the American 
system 
(in which 
the prefix 
stands 
for n 
in 103+3n ) and 
the 
British 
system 
(in which 
the 
pre- 
fix stands 
for n in 10”n).

Latin

An 
n x n Latin 
square 
is a LATIN RECTANGLE with 
k = n. 
Specifically, 
a Latin 
square 
consists 
of n sets 
of the numbers 
1 to n arranged 
in such a way that 
no 
orthogonal 
(row or column) 
contains 
the same two num- 
bers. 
The 
numbers 
of Latin 
squares 
of order 
n = 1, 2, 
. . . are 1, 2, 12, 576, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
A002860) 
l 
A pair 
of Latin 
squares 
is said to be orthogonal 
if the n2 pairs 
formed 
by juxtaposing 
the two arrays. are all distinct. 
Two of the Latin 
squares 
of order 
3 are 
which 
are orthogonal. 
Two of the 576 Latin

General 
FORMULAS for the number

squares 
L(n,n) 
are given 
by Nechvatal 
(1981), 
Gessel 
(1987), 
and Shao and Wei 
(1992). 
The 
total 
number 
of 
Latin

of order 
n can then 
be computed 
from 
N(n,n) 
= n!(n

Latitude 
The 
latitude 
of a point 
on a SPHERE is the 
elevation 
of the point 
from 
the PLANE of the equator, 
The 
lat- 
itude 
S is related 
to the COLATITUDE 
(the polar 
angle 
in SPHERICAL COORDINATES) by S = 4 - 90”. 
More 
generally, 
the latitude 
of a point 
on an ELLIPSOID is the 
ANGLE between 
a LINE PERPENDICULAR to the surface 
of the ELLIPSOID at the given 
point 
and the PLANE of 
the equator 
(Snyder 
1987). 
The equator 
therefore 
has latitude 
O”, and the north 
and 
south poles have latitude 
f90”, 
respectively. 
Latitude 
is 
also called 
GEOGRAPHIC LATITUDE or GEODETIC LAT- 
ITUDE in order 
to distinguish 
it from 
several 
subtly 
dif- 
ferent 
varieties 
of AUXILIARY 
LATITUDES. 
The 
shortest 
distance 
between 
any 
two 
points 
on a 
SPHERE is the so-called 
GREAT CIRCLE distance, 
which 
can be directly 
computed 
from 
the latitudes 
and 
LON- 
GITUDES of the two points.

A lattice 
is a system 
K 
such that 
VA 
E K, 
A c A, 
and if A c B and B c A, then 
A = B, where 
= here 
means 
“is included 
in.” 
Lattices 
offer a natural 
way 
to formalize 
and study 
the ordering 
of objects 
using 
a 
general 
concept 
known 
as the POSET 
(partially 
ordered 
set). 
The 
study 
of lattices 
is called 
LATTICE 
THEORY. 
Note 
that 
this 
type 
of lattice 
is an abstraction 
of the 
regular 
array 
of points 
known 
as LATTICE 
POINTS. 
In the plane, 
there 
are 17 lattice 
groups, 
eight 
of which 
are pure translation. 
In R3, there are 32 POINT 
GROUPS 
and 230 SPACE GROUPS. In ]w4, there 
are 4783 space 
lattice 
groups.

Path 
The 
following 
inequalities 
hold 
for any lattice: 
(x A y) v (x A 2) 5 x A (y v z) 
2 v (y A r) < (x v y) A (2 v z) 
(x A y) v (y A 2) v (z A 2) 5 (2 v y) A (y v z) A (z v 2) 
(x Ay) V (x AZ) 
< xA (yV (x AZ)) 
(GrStzer 
1971, p. 35). The first three are the distributive 
inequalities, 
and the last is the modular 
identity.

However, 
unless 
otherwise

lattice

are generally 
taken 
to refer to points 
in a square 
array, 
i.e., points 
with 
coordinates 
(m, n,. . .), where m, 
n, . . . are INTEGERS. 
An n-D 
Z[w]-lattice

defined 
as a free ~&]-MODULE

The FRACTION of lattice

of a set of spanning

none is known).

Lattice 
theory 
is the study 
of sets of objects 
known 
as 
LATTICES. It is an outgrowth 
of the study 
of BOOLEAN 
ALGEBRAS, and provides 
a framework 
for unifying 
the 
study 
of classes 
or ordered 
sets in mathematics. 
Its 
study 
was given 
a great 
boost 
by a series of papers 
and 
subsequent

written 
by Sirkhoff 
(1967).

Expressed

this is equiv-

to saying 
that F[t, t-‘]

This 
corresponds 
to F[t]

A law is a mathematical 
statement 
which 
always 
holds 
true. 
Whereas 
“laws” 
in physics 
are generally 
exper- 
imental 
observations 
backed 
up by theoretical 
under- 
pinning, 
laws in mathematics 
are generally 
THEOREMS 
which 
can formally 
be proven 
true under 
the stated 
con- 
ditions. 
However, 
the term 
is also sometimes 
used in the 
sense of an empirical 
observation, 
e.g., BENFORD’S 
LAW.

With

any outrageous 
thing 
is 
likely 
to happen 
(Diaconis

Little- 
wood 
(1953) 
considered 
an event 
which 
occurs 
one in 
a million 
times 
to be “surprising.” 
Taking 
this 
defini- 
tion, 
close to 100,000 
surprising 
events 
are “expected” 
each year in the United 
States 
alone 
and, 
in the world 
at large, 
“we can be absolutely 
sure that 
we will 
see 
incredibly 
remarkable

(Diaconis

1989).

der ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL 
EQUATION at a REMOV-

actually 
solving 
the equa- 
tion. 
Consider 
where F is ANALYTIC in z and rational 
in its other 
ar- 
guments. 
Proceed 
by making 
the substitution 
d”Y 
dz” 
(1) 
y(x) = a(z - zoy 
(2) 
with 
a < 1. For example, 
in the equation 
d2Y 
dz2 = 6y2 + Ay, 
(3) 
making 
the substitution 
gives 
a+- 
1)(Z-zO)a-2 
= 6a2(z-zo)2”+Aa(az-zo)“. 
(4) 
The most singular 
terms 
(those with the most NEGATIVE 
exponents) 
are called 
the 
“dominant 
balance 
terms,” 
and must 
balance 
exponents 
and COEFFICIENTS at the 
SINGULARITY.

and 
the solution 
behaves 
as y(z) 
=

behavior 
in the NEIGHBORHOOD of the SINGULARITY is 
given

procedure 
for finding 
the best 
fitting 
curve to a given 
set of points 
by minimizing 
the sum of 
the squares 
of the offsets (“the 
residuals”) 
of the points 
from 
the curve. 
The 
sum 
of the 
squares 
of the offsets 
is used instead 
of the offset absolute 
values 
because 
this 
allows 
the residuals 
to be treated 
as a continuous 
dif- 
ferent iable 
quantity. 
However, 
because 
squares 
of the 
offsets are used, 
outlying 
points 
can have a dispropor- 
tionate 
effect on the fit, a property 
which 
may 
or may 
not be desirable 
depending 
on the problem 
at hand.

In practice, 
the 
vertical 
offsets 
from 
a line 
are almost 
always 
minimized 
instead 
of the 
perpendicular 
offsets. 
This 
allows 
uncertainties 
of the data 
points 
along 
the x- 
and y-axes to be incorporated 
simply, 
and also provides 
a much 
simpler 
analytic 
form 
for the fitting 
parameters 
than 
would 
be obtained 
using 
a fit based on perpendic- 
ular 
distances. 
In addition, 
the fitting 
technique 
can be 
easily 
generalized 
from 
a best-fit 
line 
to a best-fit 
pdg- 
nomiul 
when sums of vertical 
distances 
are used (which 
is not 
the 
case using 
perpendicular 
distances). 
For a 
reasonable 
number 
of noisy 
data 
points, 
the difference 
between 
vertical 
and perpendicular 
fits is quite 
small. 
The 
linear 
least squares 
fitting 
technique 
is the simplest 
and most 
commonly 
applied 
form 
of LINEAR REGRES- 
SION and provides 
a solution 
to the problem 
of finding 
the best fitting 
straight 
line 
through 
a set of points. 
In 
fact, if the functional 
relationship 
between 
the two quan- 
tities 
being 
graphed 
is known 
to within 
additive 
or mul- 
tiplicative 
constants, 
it is common 
practice 
to transform 
the data in such a way that 
the resulting 
line is a straight 
line, 
say by plotting 
T vs. fi 
instead 
of t vs. e. For this 
reason, 
standard 
forms 
for EXPONENTIAL, 
LOGARITH- 
MIC, and POWER laws are often 
explicitly 
computed. 
The 
formulas 
for linear 
least 
squares 
fitting 
were inde- 
pendently 
derived 
by Gauss 
and Legendre. 
For NONLINEAR LEAST SQUARES FITTING~~~ 
number 
of unknown 
parameters, 
linear 
least Fquares 
fitting 
may 
be applied 
iteratively 
to a linearized 
form 
of the func- 
tion 
until 
convergence 
is achieved. 
Depending 
on the 
type 
of fit and initial 
parameters 
chosen, 
the nonlinear

Least Squares Fitting 
fit may have good or poor convergence 
properties. 
If un- 
certainties 
(in the most 
general 
case, error 
ellipses) 
are 
given 
for the points, 
points 
can be weighted 
differently 
in order 
to give the high-quality 
points 
more 
weight. 
The 
residuals 
of the 
best-fit 
line 
for a set of n points 
using 
unsquared 
perpendicular 
distances 
di 
of points 
(xi, yi) are given 
by 
(1) 
Since 
the perpendicular 
distance 
from 
a line y = a + bx 
to point 
i is given 
by 
d I 
/Vi - (a+b)l 
i- 
diTF

(2) 
the function 
to be minimized 
is 
(3) 
Unfortunately, 
because 
the absolute 
value 
function 
does 
not 
have continuous 
derivatives, 
minimizing 
RI 
is not 
amenable 
to analytic 
solution. 
However,

Plugging

t;he rather 
unwieldy 
form of 
the best-fit 
parameters 
in the formulation. 
In addition, 
minimizing 
Rt 
for a second- 
or higher-order 
P~LYNOM- 
IAL leads to polynomial 
equations 
having 
higher 
order, 
so this formulation 
cannot

Vertical 
least squares 
fitting 
proceeds 
by finding 
the sum 
of the squmes 
of the vertical 
deviations

Note 
that 
this 
procedure 
does 
not 
minimize 
the 
actual 
deviations 
from 
the 
line 
(which 
would 
be measured 
perpendicular 
to the given function). 
In 
addition, 
although 
the 
unsquared 
sum 
of distances 
might 
seem 
a more 
appropriate 
quantity 
to minimize, 
use of the absolute 
value results 
in discontinuous 
deriva- 
tives 
which 
cannot 
be treated 
analytically. 
The 
square 
deviations 
from 
each point 
are therefore 
summed, 
and 
the resulting 
residual 
is then 
minimized 
to find the best 
fit line. 
This 
procedure 
results 
in outlying 
points 
being 
given 
disproportionately 
large 
weighting.

Lebesgue 
Covering 
Dimension 
An important 
DIMENSION 
and one of the first 
dimen- 
sions investigated. 
It is defined 
in terms 
of covering 
sets, 
and is therefore 
also called 
the 
COVERING 
DIMENSION. 
Another 
name 
for the Lebesgue 
covering 
dimension 
is 
the TOPOLOGICAL 
DIMENSION. 
A SPACE has Lebesgue 
covering 
dimension 
m if for every 
open 
COVER 
of that 
space, there 
is an open COVER that 
refines 
it such that 
the 
refinement 
has order 
at most 
m. + 1. Consider 
how many 
elements 
of the cover contain 
a given 
point 
in a base space. 
If this 
has a maximum 
over all the points 
in the base space, then 
this maximum 
is called 
the order 
of the cover. 
If a SPACE does not have 
Lebesgue 
covering 
dimension 
~2 for any nz, it is said to 
be infinite 
dimensional. 
Results 
of this 
definition 
are: 
1. Two homeomorphic 
spaces have the same dimension, 
2. Iw” has dimension 
n, 
3. A TOPOLOGICAL 
SPACE can be embedded 
as a closed 
subspace 
of a EUCLIDEAN 
SPACE 
IFF 
it is locally 
compact, 
Hausdorff, 
second 
countable, 
and is finite 
dimensional 
(in the sense of the 
LEBESGUE 
DIMEN- 
SION), 
and

Integral 
The 
LEBEXUE 
INTEGRAL 
is defined 
in terms 
of upper 
and 
lower bounds 
using 
the 
LEBESGUE 
MEASURE 
of a 
SET. 
It uses a LEBESGUE 
SUM S, 
= q+(Ei) 
where 
q 
is the value 
of the function 
in subinterval 
i, and p(Ei) 
is the 
LEBESGUE 
MEASURE 
of the 
SET Ei of points 
for 
which 
values 
are approximately 
q. 
This 
type of integral 
covers a wider class of functions 
than 
does the RIEMANN 
INTEGRAL.

If Z is an EVEN INTEGER, 
the series yl reduces to a POLY- 
NOMIAL 
of degree 
2 with 
only 
EVEN 
POWERS 
of x and 
the series 92 diverges. 
If 2 is an ODD 
INTEGER, 
the series 
y2 reduces 
to a POLYNOMIAL 
of degree 
Z with only 
ODD 
POWERS 
of x and the 
series ~1 diverges. 
The 
general 
solution 
for an INTEGER 
Z is given 
by the 
LEGENDRE 
POLYNOMIALS 
pn(X) 
= 
Gz 
{ 
yl (x) 
for 2 even 
y2 (2) 
for Z odd, 
(18) 
where cn is chosen 
so that 
Pn (1) = 1. If the variable 
x 
is replaced 
by cos 0, then 
the Legendre

equa-

becomes

as is derived 
for the

Legendre

The solutions

are called 
the associated

Writing

the identities 
so the EVEN 
solution 
is

Legendre’s

Counts 
the number 
of POSITIVE INTEGERS less than 
or 
equal 
to a number 
x which 
are not 
divisible 
by any of 
the first a PRIMES, 
(1) 
where 1x1 is the FLOOR FUNCTION. 
Taking 
a = x gives 
where OF 
is the PRIME COUNTING FUNCTION. 
Leg- 
endre’s 
formula 
holds 
since one more 
than 
the number 
of PRIMES in a range 
equals 
the number 
of INTEGERS 
minus 
the number 
of composites 
in the interval.

Lemniscate 
A polar

also called 
LEMNISCATE OF BERNOULLI 
which 
is the LOCUS of points 
the product 
of whose dis- 
tances 
from 
two points 
(called 
the FOCI) 
is a constant. 
Letting 
the 
FOCI 
be located 
at (*a, 
O), the Cartesian 
equation 
is 
I( x - a)” -5 ~‘][(a:

which 
can be rewritten 
x4 +y4 + 22'~'

Jakob 
Bernoulli 
published 
an article 
in Acta 
Eruditorum 
in 1694 in which 
he called 
this curve 
the lemniscus 
(“a 
pendant 
ribbon”). 
Jakob 
Bernoulli 
was not aware that 
the curve he was describing 
was a special 
case of CASSINI 
OVALS 
which 
had 
been 
described 
by Cassini 
in 1680. 
The general 
properties 
of the lemniscate 
were discovered 
by G. Fagnano 
in 1750 
(MadNor 
Archive). 
Gauss’s 
and 
Euler’s 
investigations 
of the ARC LENGTH 
of the 
curve led to later 
work on ELLIPTIC 
FUNTTIONS.

The

form,

so 
ds=

The 
lemniscate

arise 
in rectifying 
the ARC 
LENGTH of the LEMNISCATE. The 
lemniscate 
functions 
were first studied 
by Jakob 
Bernoulli 
and 
G. Fagnano. 
A historical 
account 
is given 
by Ayoub 
(1984), 
and an 
extensive 
discussion 
by Siegel 
(1969). 
The 
lemniscate 
functions 
were the first functions 
defined 
by inversion 
of 
an integral, 
which 
was first done by Gauss.

A quantity 
a is said to be less than 
b if a is smaller 
than 
b, written 
a < b. If a is less than 
or EQUAL 
to b, the

is written 
a 5 b. If a is MUCH 
LESS than

The most well-known 
CELLULAR 
AUTOMATON, 
invented 
by John 
Conway 
and popularized 
in Martin 
Gardner’s 
Scientific 
American 
column 
starting 
in October 
1970. 
The 
game 
was originally 
played 
(i.e., successive 
genera- 
tions 
were produced) 
by hand 
with 
counters, 
but imple- 
mentation 
on a computer 
greatly 
increased 
the ease of 
exploring 
patterns. 
The 
Life 
AUTOMATON 
is run 
by placing 
a number 
of 
filled 
cells on a 2-D grid. 
Each generation 
then 
switches 
cells on or off depending 
on the state 
of the cells that 
surround 
it. 
The 
rules 
are defined 
as follows. 
All 
eight 
of the cells surrounding 
the current 
one are checked 
to 
see if they 
are on or not. 
Any 
cells 
that 
are on are 
counted, 
and this count 
is then 
will 
hanDen 
to the current 
cell. 
1. 
2. 
3. 
l-T 
Death: 
if the count 
is less than 
2 or greater 
than 
3, 
the current 
cell is switched 
off. 
Survival: 
if (a) the 
count 
is exactly 
2, or (b) the 
count 
is exactly 
3 and 
the 
current 
cell 
is on, 
the 
current 
cell is left unchanged. 
Birth: 
if the current 
cell is off and the count 
is ex- 
actly 
3, the current 
cell is switched 
on.

pattern 
which 
has no Father 
Pattern 
is known 
as a Garden 
of Eden 
(for obvious 
biblical 
reasons). 
The 
first such pattern 
was not found 
until 
1971, and at least 
3 are now known. 
It is not, however, 
known 
if a pattern 
exists 
which 
has a Father 
Pattern, 
but 
no Grandfather 
Pattern 
(Gardner 
1983, p. 249). 
Rather 
surprisingly, 
Gosper 
and 
J. II. 
Conway 
inde- 
pendently 
showed 
that 
Life 
can be used to generate 
a 
UNIVERSAL 
TURING 
MACHINE 
(Berlekamp 
et al. 1982, 
Gardner 
1983, pp. 250-253).

the 
one-year-olds 
have 
an average 
age at death 
of 2.25 + 1 = 3.25, 
compared 
to 2.70 for

In effect, the age of death 
of older 
individuals

conditioned 
on the fact that 
they 
have 
survived 
to their 
present

the average

It is called

Ro.

weighting 
the 
offspring 
counted

column 
by their

Therefore, 
the 
ratio 
T = 
~(xZxmx)/)(Z,m,) 
is the mean 
gener- 
ation 
time 
of the population. 
The 
MALTHUSIAN PARAMETER T measures 
the repro- 
ductive

can be calculated 
as 
r = (lnRo)/T.

In the above 
two tables, 
the populations 
have identical 
reproductive 
rates of Ro = 1.10. 
However, 
the shift to- 
ward 
later 
reproduction 
in population 
2 increases 
the 
generation 
time, 
thus 
slowing 
the rate 
of POPULATION 
GROWTH. 
Often, 
a slight 
delay 
of reproduction 
de- 
creases POPULATION GROWTH more 
strongly 
than 
does 
even a fairly 
large 
reduction 
in reproductive

If, on 
the other 
hand,

the functions

linearly

is equivalent 
to

Lituus 
An ARCHIMEDEAN 
SPIRAL 
with 
m = -2, 
having 
polar 
equation 
r28 = u2. 
Lituus 
means 
a “crook,” 
in the 
sense of a bishop’s 
crosier. 
The 
lituus 
curve originated 
with 
Cotes 
in 1722. 
Maclaurin 
used the term 
lituus 
in his book 
Hurmonia 
Mensururum 
in 1722 (MacTutor 
Archive). 
The 
lituus 
is 
the locus of the point 
P moving 
such that 
the AREA 
of 
a circular 
SECTOR remains 
constant.

Given

draw the PERPENDIC-

Let PD 
be any other 
line 
from 
P which

as D moves 
off to infinity 
along 
CB, 
then 
the line

the limiting

PE,

is 
said to be parallel

The angle

Logarithm 
(6) 
The 
logarithm 
is defined 
to be the INVERSE 
FUNCTION 
of taking 
a number 
to a given 
POWER. 
Therefore, 
for 
any II: and 6, 
rJ = pax, 
(1) 
or equivalently, 
x = log,(b”). 
(2) 
Here, 
the 
POWER 
b is known 
as the 
BASE 
of the log- 
arithm. 
For any 
BASE, 
the 
logarithm 
function 
has a 
SINGULARITY 
at 
x 
= 0. 
In 
the 
above 
plot, 
the 
solid 
curve 
is the logarithm 
to BASE e (the NATURAL 
LOGA- 
RITHM), 
and the dotted 
curve 
is the logarithm 
to BASE 
10 (LOG).

Theorem 
Logarithms 
are used in many 
areas of science 
and engi- 
neering 
in which 
quantities 
vary over a large 
range. 
For 
example, 
the decibel 
scale for the loudness 
of sound, 
the 
Richter 
scale of earthquake 
magnitudes, 
and the astro- 
nomical 
scale of stellar 
brightnesses 
are all logarithmic 
scales.

RITHM and 
is denoted 
Ins 
(LN). 
The 
logarithm 
BASE 
10 is denoted 
log x (LOG), 
(although 
mathematics 
texts 
often 
use log x to mean 
In x). The 
logarithm 
BASE 2 is 
denoted 
lgx 
(LG). 
An interesting 
property 
of logarithms 
follows 
from look- 
ing for a number 
y such that 
log& + Y) = - 10&(X - Y) 
(12)

x+y=- 
X-Y 
(13)

-y2=1 
(14) 
Y- 
d x2 - 1 ? 
(15) 
so 
log,(x + &T) 
= - log,(x - &T). 
(16) 
Numbers 
of the form 
log, b are IRRATIONAL if a and b 
are INTEGERS, one of which 
has a PRIME factor 
which 
the 
other 
lacks. 
A. Baker 
made 
a major 
step forward 
in TRANSCENDENTAL NUMBER theory 
by proving 
the 
transcendence 
of sums of numbers 
of the form 
a In p for 
a and p ALGEBRAIC NUMBERS.

ROMAN COEFFICIENT. 
For t = 0, the logarithmic 
bino-

theorem 
reduces 
to the classical 
BINOMIAL 
THEO- 
REM for POSITIVE n, since A;?,(a) 
= an-’ 
for n > k, 
A:.&) 
= 0 for n < k, and 
= (z) when n 2 k 2 0. 
Similarly, 
taking 
t = 1 and n < 0 gives the NEGATIVE 
BINOMIAL SERIES. Roman 
(1992) 
gives expressions 
ob- 
tained 
for the 
case t = 
1 and 
n 2 
0 which 
are not 
obtainable 
from 
the BINOMIAL THEOREM.

Logic 
The 
formal 
mathematical 
study 
of the methods, 
struc- 
ture, 
and validity 
of mathematical 
deduction 
and proof. 
Formal 
logic 
seeks to devise 
a complete, 
consistent 
for- 
mulation 
of mathematics 
such that 
propositions 
can be 
formally 
stated 
and proved 
using a small 
number 
of sym- 
bols with 
well-defined 
meanings. 
While 
this sounds 
like 
an admirable 
pursuit 
in principle, 
in practice 
the study 
of mathematical 
logic 
can rapidly 
become 
bogged 
down 
in pages of dense and unilluminating 
mathematical 
sym- 
bols, of which 
Whitehead 
and Russell’s 
Principia 
Muth- 
ematica 
(1925) 
is perhaps 
the best 
(or worst) 
example. 
A very simple 
form 
of logic 
is the study 
of “TRUTH 
TA- 
BLES" and 
digital 
logic 
circuits 
in which 
one or more 
outputs 
depend 
on a combination 
of circuit 
elements 
(AND, 
NAND, 
OR, 
XOR, 
etc.; 
“gates”) 
and the input 

1100 
Logical Paradox 
values. 
In such a circuit, 
values 
at each point 
can take 
on 
values of only 
TRUE 
(1) ~r FALSE 
(0). 
DE MORGAN’S 
DUALITY 
LAW is a useful 
principle 
for the analysis 
and 
simplification 
of such circuits. 
A generalization 
of this simple 
type of logic in which pos- 
sible values 
are TRUE, 
FALSE, 
and “undecided” 
is called 
THREE-VALUED 
LOGIC. 
A further 
generalization 
called 
FUZZY 
LOGIC 
treats 
“truth” 
as a continuous 
quantity 
ranging 
from 
0 to 1.

in 1845 by the Bel- 
gian P.-F. 
Verhulst) 
is defined 
by 
G-&+1 
= 
?-x,(1 
- 
xn), 
(1) 
where T (sometimes 
also denoted 
p) is a POSITIVE 
con- 
stant 
(the 
“biotic 
potential”). 
We will 
start 
x0 in the 
interval 
[0, 11. In order 
to keep points 
in the interval, 
we 
must 
find 
appropriate 
conditions 
on T. The 
maximum 
value 
xn+l 
can take 
is found 
from 
dx n+l 
dxn 
= T(1 - 2x4 
= 0, 
(2) 
so the largest 
value 
of xn+l 
occurs 
for xn = l/2. 
Plug- 
ging 
this 
in, max(x,+l) 
= r/4. 
Therefore, 
to keep 
the 
MAP 
in the desired 
region, 
we must 
have T E (0,4]. 
The 
. 
JACOBIAN 
is 
J = 
n+l 
I 
I 
- 
= Ir(l 
- 2x,)1, 
‘ix 
(3) 
n 
and the MAP 
is stable 
at a point 
x0 if J(x0) 
< 1. Now 
we wish to find the FIXED POINTS of the MAP, which 
occur 
when xn+l 
= xn. 
Drop 
the n subscript 
on xn 
f( 
> 
2 
= rx(1 
- x) = x 
(4) 
x[l-7ql-x)] 
= x(1-r+rx) 
= TX [x - 
(1- 
v’)] 
= 0, 
(5) 
(1) 
so the FIXED 
POINTS 
are x1 
= 0 and xr) 
= 1 - T-? 
An interesting 
thing 
happens 
if a value of T greater 
than 
3 is chosen. 
The 
map 
becomes 
unstable 
and we get a 
PITCHFORK 
BIFURCATION 
with 
two stable 
orbits 
of pe- 
riod 
two corresponding 
to the two stable 
FIXED 
POINTS 
of f2(x). 
The 
fixed 
points 
of order 
two must 
satisfy 
X12+2 
= x:n, so 
h&+2 
=mL+1(1 
-G&+1) 
=T[TX*(l-Xn)][l-TXn(l-X2n)] 
= r2x,(1-xn)(l- 
TXfl +Tx71")= 
xn.

Now, 
drop 
the r~ subscripts 
and rewrite 
z{r2[1-

(7) 
x[-r3z3

(8) 
--Tsx[x - (I-r-l)][z2

r-l(l+r-l)] 
= 0. 
(9) 
Notice 
that 
we have found 
the first-order 
FIXED 
PRINTS 
as well, since two iterations 
of a first-order 
FIXED 
POINT 
produce 
a trivial 
second-order 
FIXED

The

These

are only 
REAL

the Z-CYCLE 
begins. 
Now look 
for <he onset

To eliminate 
the Z- and ~-CYCLES, 
consider

The

IMAGINARY

two of them

BIFURCATIONS

(8,

suddenly 
break 
off. 
Beyond 
a certain 
point 
known 
as the ACCUMULATION

periodicity 
gives way to CHAOS.

In the middle 
of 
the complexity, 
a window 
suddenly 
appears 
with 
a reg- 
ular 
period 
like 
3 or 7 as a result 
of MODE

The

occurs 
at T = 1 + 21/z

below. 
Following 
the

the PERIOD

then 
begin 
again 
with

once 
again 
break 
off to CHAOS.

The first n of these give f(z),

and the

the onset of period

Further

neither 
of these 
tech- 
niques 
generalizes 
easily 
to higher 
CYCLES. 
BechhoeEer

Gordon 
(1996) 
derives 
not only the value for the onset of 
the S-CYCLE, 
but 
also an upper 
bound 
for the r-values 
supporting 
stable 
period

This

the CUBIC

The 
azimuthal 
coordinate 
on the surface 
of a SPHERE 
(0 in SPHERICAL COORDINATES) 
or on 
a SPHEROID 
(in PROLATE or OBLATE SPHEROIDAL COORDINATES). 
Longitude 
is defined 
such that 
0” = 360”. 
Lines 
of con-

longitude 
are generally 
called 
MERIDIANS. 
The 
other 
angular 
coordinate 
on the surface 
of a SPHERE is 
called 
the LATITUDE. 
The 
shortest 
distance 
between 
any 
two

on 
a 
SPHERE is the so-called 
GREAT CIRCLE distance, 
which 
can be directly 
computed 
from

Sequence 
The INTEGER SEQUENCE beginning 
with a single digit 
in 
which 
the next term 
is obtained 
by describing 
the previ- 
ous term. 
Starting 
with 
1, the sequence 
would be defined 
by “one 
1, two Is, one 2 two ls,” 
etc., and the result 
is 
1, 11, 21, 1211, 
111221, 
312211, 
13112221, 
1113213211, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
A005150). 
Starting 
the sequence 
instead 
with 
the digit 
d for 2 < 
d < 
9 gives 
d, Id, 
llld, 
3lld, 
13211d, 
111312211d, 
31G1122211d, 
1321132132211d, 
. . . The 
sequences 
for 
d= 
2 and 3 are Sloane’s 
A006715 
and A006751. 
The 
number 
of DIGITS in the nth term 
of both 
the sequences 
for 1 < n < 9 is asymptotic 
to CX”,

Low-Dimensional 
Topology 
Low-dimensional 
topology 
usually 
deals 
with 
objects 
that 
are 2-, 3-, or 4-dimensional 
in nature. 
Properly 
speaking, 
low-dimensional 
topology 
should 
be part 
of 
DIFFERENTIAL 
TOPOLOGY, 
but 
the 
general 
machin- 
ery of ALGEBRAIC 
and DIFFERENTIAL 
TOPOLOGY 
gives 
only 
limited 
information. 
This 
fact is particularly 
no- 
ticeable 
in dimensions 
three 
and four, and so alternative 
specialized 
methods 
have evolved.

A fundamental 
result 
in MODEL

states 
that 
if a countable

Furthermore, 
it has a model 
of every

Lucky 
Number 
of Euler 
A number 
p such that the PRIME-GENERATING 
POLY- 
NOMIAL 
n2 -n+p 
is PRIME 
for n = 
0, 1, . . . , p - 2. 
Such 
numbers 
are 
related 
to the 
COMPLEX 
QUADRATIC 
FIELD 
in which 
the RING of INTEGERS is factorable. 
Specifically, 
the 
Lucky 
numbers 
of Euler 
(excluding 
the trivia1 
case p = 
3) are those numbers 
p such that 
the QUADRATIC 
FIELD 
Q(dm) 
has CLASS 
NUMBER 
1 (Rabinowitz 
1913, 
Le Lionnais 
1983, Conway 
and Guy 
1996). 
As established 
by Stark 
(1967), 
there 
are only 
nine num- 
bers -d 
such that 
h(-d) 
= 1 (the 
HEEGNER

-2, 
-3, 
-7, 
-11,

and 
of 
these, 
only 
7, 11, 19, 43, 67, and 
163 are of the 
re- 
quired 
form. 
Therefore, 
the 
only 
Lucky

of 
Euler 
are 2, 3, 5, 11, 
17, and

The 
Lyapunov 
characteristic 
exponent 
[LCE] 
gives the 
rate 
of exponential

from 
perturbed

To examine 
the behavior 
of an orbit 
around 
a point 
X*(t), 
perturb 
the system 
and write 
X(t) = x*(t) + u(t), 
where 
U(t) 
is the 
average 
deviation 
from 
the 
unper- 
turbed 
trajectory 
at time 
t. In a CHAOTIC region, 
the 
LCE

is always 0, since 
there

tory

The

the LCE, 
the greater 
the rate

the corresponding

Numerically,

be g1 = 02 = 0, so 
the motion 
is QUASIPERIODIC and cannot 
be CHAOTIC. 
For higher 
order HAMILTONIAN 
SYSTEMS, there 
are al- 
ways at least 
two 0 LCEs, 
but 
other 
LCEs 
may 
enter 
in plus-and-minus 
pairs 
Z and -2. 
If they, 
too, 
are both 
zero, the motion 
is integrable 
and not CHAOTIC. If they 
are NONZERO, the POSITIVE LCE 
2 results 
in an expo- 
nential 
separation 
of trajectories, 
which 
corresponds 
to 
a CHAOTIC region. 
Notice 
that 
it is not possible 
to have 
all LCEs NEGATIVE, which 
explains 
why convergence 
of 
orbits 
is never 
observed 
in HAMILT~NIAN 
SYSTEMS. 
Now consider 
a dissipative 
system. 
For an arbitrary 
n- 
D phase 
space, 
there 
must 
always 
be one LCE 
equal 
to 0, since a perturbation 
along 
the path 
results 
in no 
divergence. 
The 
LCEs 
satisfy 
xi 
5; < 0. Therefore, 
for 
a 2-D phase space of a dissipative 
system, 
51 = 0,52 
< 
0. For a 3-D phase space, 
there 
are three 
possibilities:

Maclaurin-Bezout 
Theorem 
The 
Maclaurin-B&out 
theorem 
says 
that 
two curves 
of 
degree 
n intersect 
in n2 points, 
so two CUBICS 
intersect 
in nine 
points. 
This 
means 
that 
n(n 
+ 3)/2 
points 
do 
not always uniquely 
determine 
a single 
curve of order n.

PARADOX 
Maclaurin-Cauchy 
Theorem 
If f(z) 
is POSITIVE 
and decreases 
to 0, then 
an EULER 
CONSTANT 
can be defined. 
If f(x) 
= l/x, 
then 
where y is the EULER-MASCHERONI 
CONSTANT.

Mach urin Trisec trix 
Maclaurin 
Xkisectrix 
A curve first studied 
by Colin 
Maclaurin 
in 1742. 
It was 
studied 
to provide 
a solution 
to one of the GEOMETRIC 
PROBLEMS OF ANTIQUITY, 
in particular 
TRISECTION of 
an ANGLE, whence 
the name 
trisectrix. 
The 
Maclaurin 
trisectrix 
is an ANALLAGMATIC 
CURVE, and the origin 
isa CRUNODE. 
The 
Maclaurin 
trisectrix 
has CARTESIAN equation 
x2(x + 34 
Y2= 
u-x 
1 
(1) 
or the parametric 
equations 
t2 - 3 
x=a- 
t2 + 1 
(2) 
t(t2 - 3) 
y=y2+1* 
(3) 
The 
ASYMPTOTE has equation 
x = a, and the center 
of the 
loop 
is as (2a, 0). 
Draw 
a line 
L with 
ANGLE 
3a through 
the 
loop 
center. 
Then 
the angle 
made 
by 
the line through 
the center 
and point 
of intersection 
of 
L with 
the trisectrix 
is QI. The 
trisectrix 
is sometimes 
defined 
instead 
as 
x(x2 + y”) = a(y2 - 3x2) 
(4) 
y2 = x2(3a 
+ x) 
U-X 
(5) 
(6) 
Another 
form 
of the equation 
is the POLAR 
EQUATION 
r = asec@), 
(7) 
where the origin 
is inside 
the loop and the crossing 
point 
is on the NEGATIVE 
X-AXIS. 
The 
tangents 
to the curve 
at the origin 
make 
angles 
of 
1t60” 
with 
the X-AXIS. 
The 
AREA 
of the loop is 
A loop 
= 3J3a2, 
(8) 
and 
the NEGATIVE x-intercept 
is (-3a, 
0) (MacTutor 
Archive)

The 
quantities 
obtained 
from 
cubic, 
hexagonal, 
etc., 
LATTICE SUMS, evaluated 
at s = 1, are called 
Madelung 
constants. 
For cubic LATTICE SUMS, they 
are expressi- 
ble in closed 
form 
for EVEN 
indices, 
h(2) = -4P(Ml) 
= -42ln2 
= -7rln2

where the prime 
indicates 
that

b3(1) is some times 
called 
“the”

equal to -1.74756.

No perfect 
magic 
cubes of order five are known, 
although 
it is known 
that 
such a cube must 
have a central 
value 
of 63 (Beeler 
et 
al. 1972, 
Item 
51; 
Gardner 
1988). 
No 
order-six 
per- 
fect magic 
cubes are known, 
but 
Langman 
(1962) 
con- 
structed 
a perfect 
magic 
cube of order 
seven. 
An order- 
eight 
perfect 
magic 
cube was published 
anonymously 
in 
1875 
(Barnard 
1888, 
Benson 
and 
Jacoby 
1981, 
Gard- 
ner 1988). 
The 
construction 
of such a cube is discussed 
in Ball 
and Coxeter 
(1987). 
Rosser 
and Walker 
redis- 
covered 
the order-eight 
cube in the late 
1930s (but 
did 
not publish 
it), and Myers 
independently 
discovered 
the 
cube illustrated 
above in 1970 (Gardner 
1988). 
Order 
9 
and 11 magic 
cubes have also been discovered, 
but none 
For n = 1, 2, . . . , the magic 
constants 
are 1, 9, 42, 130, 
315, 651, . . . (Sloane’s 
A027441). 
Semiperfect 
pandiagonal 
cubes 
exist 
for all orders 
8n 
and all 000 
n > 8 (Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987). 
A perfect 
been constructed 
by Planck 
Berlekamp 
et al. (1982, p. 783) give a magic 
TESSERACT. 
The 
above 
semiperfect 
magic 
cubes 
of orders 
three 
(Hunter 
and 
Madachy 
1975, 
p. 31; Ball 
and 
Coxeter 
1987, 
p. 218) and four 
(Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987, 
p. 220) 
have 
magic 
constants 
42 and 
130, respectively. 
There 
is a trivial 
semiperfect 
magic 
cube of order 
one, but 
no 
semiperfect 
cubes of orders 
two or three 
exist. 
Semiper- 
feet cubes of ODD 
order 
with 
n > 5 and DOUBLY 
EVEN 
- 
order 
can be constructed 
by extending 
the methods 
used 
for MAGIC 
SQUARES.

Kraitchik 
(1942) 
gives general 
techniques 
of construct- 
ing EVEN 
and 
ODD 
squares 
of order 
n. 
For n ODD, 
a 
very 
straightforward 
technique 
known 
as the 
Siamese 
method 
can be used, 
as illustrated 
above 
(Kraitchik 
1942, pp. 148-149). 
It begins 
by placing 
a 1 in any lo- 
cation 
(in the center 
square 
of the top row in the above 
example), 
then 
incrementally 
placing 
subsequent 
num- 
bers in the square 
one unit 
above 
and to the right. 
The 
counting 
is wrapped 
around, 
so that 
falling 
off the top 
returns 
on the bottom 
and falling 
off the right 
returns 
on the left. 
When 
a square 
is encountered 
which 
is al- 
ready 
filled, 
the next number 
is instead 
placed 
below the 
previous 
one and the method 
continues 
as before. 
The 
method, 
also called 
de la Loubere’s 
method, 
is purpor- 
ted to have been first 
reported 
in the West 
when de la 
Loubere 
returned 
to France 
after serving 
as ambassador 
to Siam. 
A generalization 
of this 
method 
uses an “ordinary 
vec- 
tor” 
(2, y) which 
gives 
the offset for each noncolliding 
move 
and 
a “break 
vector” 
(U,ZI) 
which 
gives the off- 
set to introduce 
upon 
a collision. 
The 
standard 
Siamese 
method 
therefore 
has ordinary 
vector 
(1, - 1) and break 
vector 
(0, 1). In order 
for this to produce 
a magic 
square, 
each break 
move must 
end up on an unfilled 
cell. 
Special 
classes of magic 
squares 
can be constructed 
by consider- 
ing the absolute 
sums 
Iu+u~, 
](u-x)+(;Y--)I, 
lzl--1, 
and 
j(u-x)-( 
‘u - y)I = IU + y - z - ~1. Call 
the set 
of these numbers 
the sumdiffs 
(sums and differences). 
If 
all sumdiffs 
are RELATIVELY 
PRIME 
to n and the square 
is a magic 
square, 
then 
the square 
is also a PANMAGIC 
SQUARE. 
This 
theory 
originated 
with 
de la Hire. 
The 
following 
table 
gives the sumdiffs 
for particular 
choices 
of ordinary 
and break 
vectors.

A second 
method 
for generating 
magic 
squares 
of ODD 
order 
has been 
discussed 
by J. H. Conway 
under 
the 
name 
of the “lozenge” 
method. 
As illustrated 
above, 
in 
this 
method, 
the ODD 
numbers 
are built 
up along 
diag- 
onal lines in the shape of a DIAMOND 
in the central 
part 
of the square. 
The 
EVEN 
numbers 
which 
were missed 
are then 
added 
sequentially 
along 
the continuation 
of 
the 
diagonal 
obtained 
by wrapping 
around 
the square 
until 
the wrapped 
diagonal 
reaches 
its initial 
point. 
In 
the above 
square, 
the first 
diagonal 
therefore 
fills in 1,

An elegant 
method 
for constructing 
magic 
squares 
of 
DOUBLY 
EVEN 
order 
n = 
4nz is to draw 
2s through 
each 4 x 4 subsquare 
and 
fill 
all 
squares 
in sequence. 
Then 
replace 
each entry 
aij 
on a crossed-off 
diagonal 
by (n2 + 1) - 
aij 
or, equivalently, 
reverse 
the order 
of 
the crossed-out 
entries. 
Thus 
in the above 
example 
for 
n = 8, the crossed-out 
numbers 
are originally 
1, 4, . , . , 
61, 64, so entry 
1 is replaced 
with 
64, 4 with 
61, etc.

A very elegant 
method 
for constructing 
magic 
squares 
of SINGLY 
EVEN 
order 
n = 4nz + 2 with 
m > 1 (there 
is 
- 
no magic 
square 
of order 
2) is due to 3. H. Conway, 
who 
calls it the “LUX” 
method. 
Create 
an array 
consisting 
of m + 1 rows of Ls, 1 row of Us, and m - 1 rows of 
Xs, all of length 
n/2 
= 2nz + 1. Interchange 
the middle 
U with 
the L above 
it. 
Now generate 
the magic 
square 
of order 
2m + 1 using 
the Siamese 
method 
centered 
on 
the array 
of letters 
(starting 
in the center 
square 
of the 
top row), 
but 
fill 
each set of four 
squares 
surrounding 
a letter 
sequentially 
according 
to the order 
prescribed 
by the the letter. 
That 
order 
is illustrated 
on the left 
side of the above 
figure, 
and 
the 
completed 
square 
is 
illustrated 
to the right. 
The 
“shapes” 
of the letters 
L, 
U, and X naturally 
suggest 
the filling 
order, 
hence 
the 
name 
of the algorithm. 
It is an unsolved 
problem 
to determine 
the number 
of 
magic 
squares 
of an arbitrary 
order, 
but 
the 
number 
of distinct 
magic 
squares 
(excluding 
those 
obtained 
by 
rotation 
and reflection) 
of order 
n = 1, 2, 
. 
l m are 1, 0, 1, 
880, 275305224,... 
(Sloane’s 
A006052; 
Madachy 
1979, 
p. 87). 
The 
880 squares 
of order 
four were enumerated 
by Frenicle 
de Bessy in the seventeenth 
century, 
and are 
illustrated 
in Berlekamp 
et al. (1982, pp. 778-783). 
The 
number 
of 6 x 6 squares 
is not known.

Tour 
Let 
a chess piece 
make 
a TOUR 
on an n x n CHESS- 
BOARD whose squares 
are numbered 
from 
1 to n2 along 
the path 
of the chess piece. 
Then 
the TOUR 
is called 
a 
magic 
tour 
if the resulting 
arrangement 
of numbers 
is a 
MAGIC 
SQUARE. 
If the first 
and last squares 
traversed 
are connected 
by a move, 
the tour is said to be closed (or 

Magic Tour

%e-entrant”); 
otherwise 
it is open. 
The MAGIC CON- 
STANT for the 8 x 8 CHESSBOARD is 260.

for n ODD, 
and 
are believed 
to be impossible 
for n = 
8. The 
“most 
magic” 
knight 
tour 
known 
on the 8 x 8 
board 
is the SEMIMAGIC SQUARE illustrated 
in the above 
left figure 
(Ball

main 
diagonal 
sums 
of 348 and 
168. 
Combining 
two half- 
knights’ 
tours 
one above 
the other 
as in the above 
right 
figure 
does, however, 
give a MAGIC SQUARE (Ball

Theorem 
Let 8L be a FIELD of CHARACTERISTIC 
0 (e.g., the ra- 
tionals 
Q) and let {Us} 
be a SEQUENCE of elements 
of 
K which 
satisfies 
a difference 
equation 
of the form 
where 
the 
COEFFICIENTS 
ci are fixed 
elements 
of K. 
Then, 
for any c f K, 
we have 
either 
un. = c for only 
finitely 
many 
values 
of n, or tin = c for the values 
of n 
in some ARITHMETIC 
PROGRESSION. 
The 
proof 
involves 
embedding 
certain 
fields 
inside 
the 
p-ADIC

erties 
of zeros of POWER series over Q, (STRASSMAN'S

Mandelbar 
Set 
A FRACTAL 
set analogous 
to the MANDELBROT 
SET or 
its generalization 
to a higher 
power with 
the variable 
z 
replaced 
by its COMPLEX 
CONJUGATE 
x*.

also 
MANDELBROT 
SET 
where points 
C for which 
the orbit 
z = 0 does not tend 
to infinity 
are in the 
SET. 
It marks 
the set of points 
in the 
COMPLEX 
PLANE 
such 
that 
the 
corresponding 
JULIA 
SET is CONNECTED 
and not 
COMPUTABLE. 
The 
Mandelbrot 
set was originally 
called 
a p MOLECULE 
by 
Mandelbrot. 
J. Hubbard 
and 
A. Douady 
proved 
that 
the 
Mandel- 
brot 
set is CONNECTED. 
Shishikura 
(1994) 
proved 
that 
the boundary 
of the Mandelbrot 
set is a FRACTAL 
with 
HAUSDORFF 
DIMENSION 
2. However, 
it is not yet known 
if the 
Mandelbrot 
set is pathwise-connected. 
If it is 
pathwise-connected, 
then 
Hubbard 
and Douady’s 
proof 
implies 
that 
the Mandelbrot 
set is the image 
of a CIR- 
CLE and can be constructed 
from 
a DISK 
by collapsing 
certain 
arcs in the interior 
(Douady 
1986). 
The AREA 
of the set is known 
to lie between 
1.5031 and 
1.5702; 
it is estimated 
as 1.50659.. 
. . 
Decomposing 
the COMPLEX 
coordinate 
x = 2 + iy and 
20 = a + ib gives 
x1 = x2 -y2+a

y’ = 2xy + b.

A common

is to define 
an INTEGER

as T = 2, and

When 
written

(11) 
which 
are 8 CIRCLE, an OVAL, and a PEAR CURVE. In 
fact, the second LEMNISCATE L2 can be written 
in terms 
of a new coordinate 
system 
with 
x’ E x - l/2 
as 
K x1 - $)2 + y"][(x' + i)" + y2] = r2, 
(12) 
which 
is just 
a CASSINI OVAL with 
a = l/2 
and b2 = 
T. The 
LEMNISCATES 
grow increasingly 
convoluted 
with 
higher 
COWNT 
and approach 
the Mandelbrot 
set as the 
COUNT 
tends 
to infinity. 
The 
kidney 
bean-shaped 
portion 
of the Mandelbrot 
set 
is bordered 
by a CARDIOID 
with 
equations 
4x = 2 cos t - cos( 2q 
(13) 
4Y = 2sint

(14) 
The adjoining 
portion 
is a CIRCLE 
with center 
at (-1,O) 
and RADIUS 
l/4. 
One region 
of the Mandelbrot 
set con- 
taining 
spiral 
shapes 
is known 
as SEA HORSE 
VALLEY 
because 
the shape 
resembles 
the tail 
of a sea horse. 
Generalizations 
of the 
Mandelbrot 
set 
can 
be 
con- 
structed 
by replacing 
zn2 with 
2,’ 
*k 
or GL ? where k is a 
POSITIVE INTEGER and z* denotes 
the COMPLEX 
CON- 
JUGATE of X. The following 
figures 
show the FRACTALS 
obtained 
for Jz = 2, 3, and 4 (Dickau).

Manifold 
Mantissa 
Rigorously, 
an n-D 
(topological) 
manifold 
is a Togo- 
LOGICAL 
SPACE 
A4 such that 
any point 
in M 
has a 
NEIGHBORHOOD 
U c M whichis 
HOMEOMORPHIC~OW 
D EUCLIDEAN 
SPACE. 
The 
HOMEOMORPHISM 
is called 
a 
chart, 
since it lays that 
part 
of the manifold 
out flat, like 
charts 
of regions 
of the Earth. 
So a preferable 
statement 
is that 
any object 
which 
can be “charted” 
is a manifold. 
For a REAL 
NUMBER 
X, the mantissa 
is defined 
as the 
POSITIVE 
fractional 
part 
~1: - 
1x1 = frac(x), 
where 
1x1 
denotes 
the FLOOR 
FUNCTION.

The 
most 
important 
manifolds 
are 
DIFFERENTIABLE 
MANIFOLDS. 
These 
are manifolds 
where 
overlapping 
charts 
“relate 
smoothly” 
to each other, 
meaning 
that 
the inverse 
of one followed 
by the other 
is an infinitely 
differentiable 
map 
from 
EUCLIDEAN 
SPACE to itself. 
Manifolds 
arise 
naturally 
in a variety 
of mathematical 
and physical 
applications 
as “global 
objects.” 
For exam- 
ple, in order 
to precisely 
describe 
all the configurations 
of a robot 
arm or all the possible 
positions 
and momenta 
of a rocket, 
an object 
is needed 
to store all of these pa- 
rameters. 
The objects 
that 
crop up are manifolds. 
From 
the geometric 
perspective, 
manifolds 
represent 
the pro- 
found 
idea having 
to do with 
global 
versus local 
proper- 
ties. 
Consider 
the ancient 
belief 
that 
the Earth 
was flat com- 
pared 
to the 
modern 
evidence 
that 
it is round. 
The 
discrepancy 
arises essentially 
from 
the fact that 
on the 
small 
scales that 
we see, the Earth 
does look 
Aat. 
We 
cannot 
see it curve because 
we are too small 
(although 
the 
Greeks 
did 
notice 
that 
the 
last 
part 
of a ship 
to 
disappear 
uver the horizon 
was the mast). 
We can de- 
tect curvature 
only indirectly 
from 
our vantage 
point 
on 
the Earth. 
The 
basic idea for this 
“problem” 
was codi- 
fied by PoincarL 
The 
problem 
is that 
on a small 
scale, 
the Earth 
is nearly 
flat. 
In general, 
any object 
which 
is 
nearly 
“flat” 
on small 
scales is a manifold, 
and so mani- 
folds constitute 
a generalization 
of objects 
we could 
live 
on in which 
we would 
encounter 
the round/flat 
Earth 
problem.

Map 
Coloring 
Given 
a map 
with 
GENUS 
g > 0, Heawood 
showed 
in 
1890 that 
the maximum 
number 
NU of colors 
necessary 
to color 
a map 
(the 
CHROMATIC 
NUMBER) 
on an un- 
bounded 
surface 
is 
where 
[zJ 
is the 
FLOOR 
FUNCTION, 
g is the 
GENUS, 
and x is the EULER 
CHARACTERISTIC. 
This 
is the HEA- 
WOOD 
CONJECTURE. 
In 1968, for any orientable 
surface 
other 
than 
the SPHERE 
(or equivalently, 
the PLANE) 
and 
any nonorientable 
surface 
other 
than 
the 
KLEIN 
BOT- 
TLE, NU was shown 
to be not merely 
a maximum, 
but 
the actual 
number 
needed 
(Ringel 
and Youngs 
1968). 
When 
the FOUR-COLOR 
THEOREM 
was proven, 
the Hea- 
wood FORMULA 
was shown to hold also for all orientable 
and 
nonorientable 
surfaces 
with 
the 
exception 
of the 

Map Folding 
Mapes’ Method 
1137 
KLEIN BOTTLE. For this case (which 
has EULER 
CHAR- 
ACTERISTIC 1, and therefore 
can be considered 
to have 
g = l/2), 
th e actual 
number 
of colors 
N needed 
is six- 
one less than Nu = 7 (Franklin 
1934; Saaty 
1986, p* 45).

Mathematics 
is a broad-ranging 
field 
of study 
in which 
the properties 
and interactions 
of idealized 
objects 
are 
examined. 
Whereas 
mathematics 
began 
merely 
as a cal- 
culational 
tool 
for computation 
and tabulation 
of quan- 
tities, 
it has blossomed 
into 
an extremely 
rich 
and di- 
verse set of tools, 
terminologies, 
and approaches 
which 
range 
from 
the purely 
abstract 
to the utilitarian. 
Bertrand 
Russell 
once whimsically 
defined 
mathematics 
as, “The 
subject 
in which 
we never 
know 
what 
we are 
talking 
about 
nor whether 
what 
we are saying 
is true” 
(Bergamini 
1969). 
The 
term 
“mathematics” 
is often 
shortened 
to ‘(math” 
in informal 
American 
speech 
and, 
consistent 
with 
the 
British 
penchant 
for adding 
superfluous 
letters, 
‘Lmaths” 
in British 
English.

transformation 
there exists one and only 
one corresponding 
matrix. 
Conversely, 
every matrix 
cor- 
responds 
to a unique 
linear 
transformation. 
The matrix 
atics, 
and was first 
is an important 
concept 
in mathem 
formulated 
by Sylvester 
and Cayley. 
Matrix 
Decomposition 
Theorem 
Let P be a MATRIX 
of EIGENVECT~RS of a given 
MA- 
TRIX A and D a MATRIX 
of the corresponding 
EIGEN- 
VALUES. Then 
A can be written 
Two 
matrices 
may 
be added 
(MATRIX 
ADDITION) 
or 
multiplied 
(MATRIX 
MULTIPLICATION) 
together 
to yield 
a new matrix. 
Other 
common 
operations 
on a single 
ma- 
trix 
are diagonalization, 
inversion 
(MATRIX 
INVERSE), 
and transposition 
(MATRIX 
TRANSPOSE). The DETER- 
MINANT det(A) 
or /A( f 
o a matrix 
A is an very important 
quantity 
which 
appears 
in many 
diverse 
applications. 
Matrices 
provide 
a concise 
notation 
which 
is extremely 
useful in a wide range 
of problems 
involving 
linear 
equa- 
tions 
(e.g., 
LEAST 
SQUA RES FITTING).

Diagonalization 
Diagonalizing 
a MATRIX 
is equivalent 
to finding 
the 
EIGENVECTORS and EIGENVALUES. The EIGENVALUES 
make 
up the entries 
of the 
diagonalized 
MATRIX, 
and 
the EIGENVECTORS make 
up the new set of axes corre- 
sponding 
to the DIAGONAL MATRIX.

Nonhomogeneous

can be solved

This

Therefore, 
if there 
is an x1 # 0 which 
is a solution, 
the 
DETERMINANT 
is zero. 
This 
is also true 
for x2, 
. l . , 
Xn, so the original 
homogeneous 
system 
has a nontrivial 
solution 
for all 
xis 
only 
if the DETERMINANT is 0. This 
approach 
is the basis for CRAMER'S RULE. 
Given 
a numerical 
solution 
to a matrix 
equation, 
the 
solution 
can be iteratively 
improved 
using 
the follow- 
ing technique. 
Assume 
that 
the 
numerically 
obtained 
solution 
to 
Ax =b 
(9) 
is x1 = x + 6x1, where 
6x1 is an error 
term. 
The 
first 
solution 
therefore 
gives 
A(x + 6x1) = b + 6b 
(10) 
where Sb is found 
by solving 
(10) 
Combining 
(11) and (12) then 
gives 
6x1 = A-?b 
= A-l(Axl 
- b) = x1 - A-lb, 
(13) 
so the next 
iteration 
to obtain 
x accurately 
should 
be 
x2 
=x14x1.

Maximally 
Linear 
Independent 
A set of VECTORS is maximally 
linearly 
independent 
if including 
any other 
VECTOR in the VECTOR SPACE 
would 
make 
it LINEARLY DEPENDENT (i.e., if any other 
VECTOR in the SPACE can be expressed 
as a linear 
com- 
bination 
of elements 
of a maximal 
set-the 
BASIS). 
Maximum 
The 
largest 
value 
of a set, function, 
etc. The 
maximum 
value of a set of elements 
A = {u~}~=~ 
is denoted 
max A 
or maxi 
ai, and is equal 
to the last element 
of a sorted 
(Le., ordered) 
version 
of A. For example, 
given 
the set 
(3, 
5, 4, l}, 
the sorted 
version 
is (1, 
3, 4, 5}, 
so the 
maximum 
is 5. 
The 
maximum 
and 
MINIMUM 
are the 
simplest 
ORDER 
STATISTICS.

point 
A continuous 
FUNCTION may 
assume 
a maximum 
at a 
single point 
or may have maxima 
at a number 
of points. 
A GLOBAL 
MAXIMUM 
of a FUNCTION 
is the largest 
value 
in the entire 
RANGE 
of the 
FUNCTION, 
and 
a LOCAL 
MAXIMU 
hood. 
M is the largest 
value 
in some local 
neighbor- 
For a function 
f(z) 
which 
is CONTINUOUS 
at a point 
20, 
a NECESSARY 
but not 
SUFFICIENT 
condition 
for f(z) 
to 
have 
a RELATIVE 
MAXIMUM 
at x = 20 is that 
20 be 
a CRITICAL 
POINT 
(i.e., 
f(z) 
is either 
not 
DIFFEREN- 
TIABLE 
at ~0 or ~0 is a STATIONARY 
POINT, in which 
case f’(z0) 
= 0). 
The 
FIRST 
DERIVATIVE 
TEST 
can be applied 
to CON- 
TINUOUS 
FUNCTIONS 
to distinguish 
maxima 
from 
MIN- 
IMA. 
For twice 
differentiable 
functions 
of one variable, 
f(z), 
or of two variables, 
f(z,y), 
the SECOND DERIV- 
ATIVE 
TEST 
can sometimes 
also identify 
the nature 
of 
an EXTREMUM. 
For a function 
f(z), 
the EXTREMUM 
TEST 
succeeds 
under 
more 
general 
conditions 
than 
the 
SECOND DERIVATIVE TEST.

A DECONVOLUTION 
ALGORITHM 
(sometimes

MEM) 
which 
functions 
by minimizing 
a smooth-

( 6LE~~~O~~y7) 
in an image. 
Maximum 
en- 
tropy 
is also called 
the ALL-POLES 
MODEL or AUTORE- 
GRESSIVE 
MODEL. 
For images 
with 
more 
than 
a million 
pixels, 
maximum 
entropy 
is faster than 
the CLEAN 
AL- 
GORITHM. 
MEM 
is commonly 
employed 
in astronomical 
synthe- 
sis imaging. 
In this 
application, 
the resolution 
depends 
on the 
signal 
to NOISE 
ratio, 
which 
must 
be speci- 
fied. 
Therefore, 
resolution 
is image 
dependent 
and varies 
across the map. 
MEM 
is also biased, 
since the ensemble 
average 
of the estimated 
noise 
is NONZERO. 
However, 
this bias is much 
smaller 
than 
the 
NOISE 
for pixels 
with 
a SNR 
>> 1. 
It can yield 
super-resolution, 
which 
can 
usually 
be trusted 
to an order 
of magnitude 
in 
SOLID 
ANGLE. 
Several 
definitions 
of “ENTROPY” 
normalized 
to the flux 
in the image 
are 
where l& 
is a “default 
image” 
and Ik is the smoothed 
image.

unnormalized 
entropy

McCoy’s 
Theorem 
If two SQUARE n x n MATRICES A and B are simulta-

by similarity 
transforms, 
then 
there 
is an ordering 
al, . . . , a72 of the EIGENVAL- 
UES of A and bl, 
. . . . b, of the 
EIGENVALUES 
of B so 
that, 
given 
any POLYNOMIAL 
p(x,y) 
in noncommuting 
variables, 
the EIGENVALUES 
of p(A, B) are the numbers 
~(a;, bi) with 
i = 
1, . l . , n. 
McCoy’s 
theorem 
states 
the converse: 
If every POLYNOMIAL 
exhibits 
the correct 
EIGENVALUES in a consistent 
ordering, 
then 
A and B 
are simultaneously 
triangularizable.

the mean

Let RI 
and R2 be the radii 
corresponding 
to the PRINCIPAL CURVATURES, then the 
multiplicative 
inverse 
of the mean

H is given 
by the multiplicative 
inverse 
of the HARMONIC MEAN, 
In terms of the GAUSSIAN CURVATURE K,

H = +(Rl

Measurable 
Function 
A function 
f : X + 
Y for which 
the pre-image 
of every 
measurable 
set in Y is measurable 
in X. 
For a BOREL 
MEASURE, 
all continuous 
functions 
are measurable. 
Measurable 
Set 
If F is a SIGMA ALGEBRA and A is a SUBSET 
of X, then 
A is called 
measurable 
if A is a member 
of F. 
X need 
not 
have, 
a priori, 
a topological 
structure. 
Even 
if it 
does, there 
may be no connect& 
between 
the open sets 
in the topology 
and the given SIGMA ALGEBRA.

Measure 
The terms 
“measure, 
” “measurable,” 
etc., have very pre- 
cise technical 
definitions 
(usually 
involving 
SIGMA AL- 
GEBRAS) which 
makes 
them 
a little 
difficult 
to under- 
stand. 
However, 
the technical 
nature 
of the definitions 
is extremely 
important, 
since it gives 
a firm 
footing 
to 
concepts 
which 
are the basis for much 
of ANALYSIS (in- 
cluding 
some 
of the slippery 
underpinnings 
of CALCU- 
LUS). 
For example, 
every 
definition 
of an INTEGRAL is based 
on a particular 
measure: 
the RIEMANN INTEGRAL is 
based 
on JORDAN MEASURE, and 
the LEBESGUE IN- 
TEGRAL is based 
on LEBESGUE MEASURE, The 
study 
of measures 
and 
their 
application 
to INTEGRATION 
is 
knownas 
MEASURE THEORY. 
A measure 
is formally 
defined 
as a MAP m : F + IR (the 
reals) 
such that 
m(0) 
= 0 and, 
if A, is a COUNTABLE 
SEQUENCE in F and the A, are pairwise 
DISJOINT, then 
m 
= xm(A). 
n 
If, in addition, 
m(X) 
= 1, then 
m is said to be a PROB- 
ABILITY MEASURE. 
A measure 
m may 
also be defined 
on SETS other 
than 
those 
in the SIGMA ALGEBRA 8’. 
I3y adding 
to F all 
sets to which 
m assigns 
measure 
zero, we again 
obtain 
a SIGMA ALGEBRA and call this the 
“completion” 
of F 
with 
respect 
to m. 
Thus, 
the 
completion 
of a SIGMA 
ALGEBRA is the 
smallest 
SIGMA ALGEBRA containing 
F and all sets of measure 
zero.

(TkiangIe) 
The 
CEVIAN 
from 
a TRIANGLE’S 
VERTEX 
to the MID- 
POINT 
of the 
opposite 
side 
is called 
a median 
of the 
TRIANGLE. 
The 
three 
medians 
of any TRIANGLE 
are 
CONCURRENT, 
meeting 
in the 
TRIANGLE’S 
CENTROID 
(which 
has TRILINEAR 
COORDINATES 
l/a 
: l/b 
: l/c). 
In addition, 
the medians 
of a TRIANGLE 
divide 
one an- 
other 
in the ratio 
2:l. 
A median 
also bisects 
the AREA 
of a TRIANGLE. 
Let nzi denote 
the length 
of the median 
of the ith 
side 
ai. 
Then 
ml2 = $(2az2 
+ 2as2 - U12>

+

+ 
u3”)

The 
AREA

by 
A = $&&m

D in the Mersenne 
number 
Mn 
is 
D = Llog(2” 
- 1) + 11 , 
(2) 
where 
llc] is the FLOOR FUNCTION, which, 
for large 
n, 
gives 
D E lnlog2 
+ 11 = LO.301029n 
+ 11 = 10.301029nj 
+ 1. 
(3) 
In order 
for the Mersenne 
number 
Mn 
to be PRIME, n 
must 
be PRIME. 
This 
is true 
since for COMPOSITE n 
with 
factors 
T and s, n = TS. Therefore, 
2n - 1 can be 
written 
as 2rs - 1, which 
is a BINOMIAL NUMBER and 
can be factored. 
Since 
the most 
interest 
in Mersenne 
numbers 
arises from 
attempts 
to factor 
them, 
many 
au- 
thors 
prefer 
to define 
a Mersenne 
number 
as a number 
of the above 
form 
MP = 2’ - 1, 
(4 
but with 
p restricted 
to PRIME values. 
The 
search 
for MERSENNE PRIMES is one of the most 
computationally 
intensive 
and actively 
pursued 
areas of 
advanced 
and distributed 
computing.

Mersenne 
Prime 
A MERSENNE NUMBER which 
is PRIME is called 
a 
Mersenne 
prime. 
In order 
for the Mersenne 
number 
M, 
defined 
by 
M, 
E 2n - 1 
for n an INTEGER to be PRIME, n must 
be PRIME. This 
is true 
since 
for 
COMPOSITE n with 
factors 
T and 
s, 
n = TS. Therefore, 
2n-1 
can be written 
as 2’“-1, 
which 
is a BINOMIAL 
NUMBER and 
can be factored. 
Every 
MERSENNE PRIME gives rise to a PERFECT NUMBER. 
If n z 3 (mod 
4)is 
a PRIME, then 
2n +l 
DIVIDES A& 
IFF 2n+l 
is PRIME. It is also true that 
PRIME 
divisors 
of 
2p - 1 must have the form 
2@+ 
1 where k is a POSITIVE 
INTEGER and simultaneously 
of either 
the form 8n.+1 
or 
8n - 1 (Uspensky 
and Heaslet). 
A PRIME factor 
p of a 
Mersenne 
number 
Mq = 2q - 1 is a WIEFERICH PRIME 
IFF ~‘12~ 
- 1, Therefore, 
MERSENNE PRIMES are lzot 
WIEFERICH PRIMES. All known 
Mersenne 
numbers 
MP 
with 
p PRIME 
are SQUAREFREE. However, 
Guy 
(1994) 
believes 
that 
there 
are h/rp which 
are not SQUAREFREE. 
TRIAL DIVISION is often used to establish 
the COMPOS- 
ITENESS of a potential 
Mersenne 
prime. 
This 
test 
im- 
mediately 
shows Mp 
to be COMPOSITE for p = 
11, 23, 
83, 131, 179, 191, 239, and 
251 (with 
small 
factors 
23, 
47, 167, 263, 359, 383, 479, 
and 
503, respectively). 
A 
much 
more powerful 
primality 
test for MP is the LUCAS- 
LEHMER TEST. 
It has been conjectured 
that 
there 
exist an infinite 
num- 
ber of Mersenne 
primes, 
although 
finding 
them 
is com- 
putationally 
very challenging. 
The table 
below gives the 
index 
p of known 
Mersenne 
primes 
(Sloane’s 
AOOOO43) 
Mpr together 
with the number 
of digits, 
discovery 
years, 
and discoverer. 
A similar 
table 
has been 
compiled 
by 
C. Caldwell. 
Note 
that 
the region 
after 
the 35th 
known 
Mersenne 
prime 
has not 
been 
completely 
searched, 
so 
identification 
of “the” 
36th Mersenne 
prime 
is tentative.

Flajolet 
and Vardi 
(1996) 
show that 
Mertens 
conjecture 
was proved 
false by Odlyzko 
and te 
Ride 
(1985). 
Their 
proof 
is indirect 
and does not pro- 
duce a specific 
counterexample, 
but it does show that

or 
even

Pintz 
(1987) 
subsequently 
showed 
that 
at 
least 
one counterexample 
to the 
conjecture 
occurs 
for

a weighted 
integral 
average

Metric 
A NONNEGATIVE function 
g(x, y) describing 
the 
“DIS- 
TANCE" between 
neighboring

for a given 
SET. A 
metric 
satisfies 
the TRIANGLE INEQUALITY 
9(x, Y) + dY7 4 
2 g(c 
4, 
with 
equality 
IFF x = y, and is symmetric, 
so 
A SET possessing 
a metric 
is called 
a METRIC SPACE. 
When 
viewed 
as a TENSOR, the metric 
is called 
a MET-

Equivalence 
Problem 
1. Find 
a complete 
system 
of invariants, 
or 
2. decide 
when two METRICS 
differ only by a coordinate 
transformation. 
The 
most 
common 
statement 
of the problem 
is, “Given 
METRICS 
g and g’, does there 
exist 
a coordinate 
trans- 
formation 
from 
one to the other?” 
Christoffel 
and Lip- 
schitz 
(1870) 
showed how to decide 
this question 
for two 
RIEMANNIAN METRICS. 
The 
solution 
by E. Cartan 
requires 
computation 
of the 
10th order 
COVARIANT DERIVATIVES. 
The 
demonstra- 
tion 
was simplified 
by A. Karlhede 
using 
the 
TETRAD 
formalism 
so that 
only 
seventh 
order 
COVARIANT 
DERIVATIVES 
need 
be computed. 
However, 
in many 
common 
cases, the first 
or second-order 
DERIVATIVES 
are SUFFICIENT 
to answer the question.

The

points 
MAB, 
MAC, 
and 
MBC 
of a TRI- 
ANGLE AABC 
are the points 
on the CIRCUMCIRCLE of 
the triangle 
which 
lie half-way 
along 
each of the three 
ARCS determined 
by the vertices 
(Johnson 
1929). 
These 
points 
arise in the definition 
of the FUHRMANN CIRCLE 
and FUHRMANN TRIANGLE, 
and 
lie on the extensions 
ofthe 
PERPENDICULAR BISECTORS of the triangle

Middlespoint 
~~~MITTENPUNKT 
Midpoint 
A 
The point 
on a LINE SEGMENT dividing 
it into 
two seg- 
ments 
of equal 
length. 
The midpoint 
of a line segment 
is 
easy to locate 
by first constructing 
a LENS using circular 
arcs, then 
connecting 
the cusps of the LENS. The 
point 
where the cusp-connecting 
line intersects 
the segment 
is 
then the midpoint 
(Pedoe 
1995, p. xii). 
It is more 
chal- 
lenging 
to locate 
the midpoint 
using 
only 
a COMPASS, 
but Pedoe 
(1995, 
pp* xviii-xix) 
gives one solution. 
In 
a RIGHT 
TRIANGLE, 
the 
midpoint 
of the 
HY- 
POTENUSE 
is equidistant 
from 
the 
three 
VERTICES 
(Dunham

Mills’ 
Constant 
N.B. 
A detailed 
on-line 
essay by S. Finch 
was the start- 
ing 
point 
fur 
this entry. 
Mills 
(1947) 
proved 
the 
existence 
of a constant 
8 = 
1.3064.. 
. such that 
is PRIME for all n 2 1, where Lx] is the FLOOR FUNC- 
TION. 
It is not, 
however, 
known 
if 0 is IRRATIONAL. 
Mills’ 
proof 
was based on the following 
theorem 
by Ho- 
heisel 
(1930) 
and 
Ingham 
(1937). 
Let 
p, 
be the 
nth 
PRIME, then 
there 
exists a constant 
K such that 
Pn+l 
-pn 
< Kpn5/’ 
(2) 
for all n. This 
has more 
recently 
been strengthened 
to 
Pn+l 
I pn < Kpn1051/1g20 
(3) 
(Mozzochi 
1986). 
If the RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS is true, 
then 
Cram& 
(1937) 
showed that 
(Finch). 
Hardy 
and 
Wright 
(1979) 
point 
out 
that, 
despite 
the 
beauty 
of such FORMULAS, they 
do not have any prac- 
t ical 
consequences. 
In fact, 
unless 
the 
exact 
value 
of 
8 is known, 
the 
PRIMES 
themselves 
must 
be known 
in 
advance 
to determine 
0. A generalization 
of Mills’ 
theo- 
rem to an arbitrary 
sequence 
of POSITIVE INTEGERS is 
given as an exercise 
by Ellison 
and Ellison 
(1985). 
Con- 
sequently, 
infinitely 
many 
values 
for 8 other 
than 
the 
number 
1.3064 . . l are possible.

A minimal 
cover is a COVER 
for which 
removal 
of one 
member 
destroys 
the covering 
property. 
Let 
p(n, 
k) be 
the number 
of minimal 
covers of { 1, . . . , n} with Fz mem- 
bers. 
Then 
2k -k-l 
m-k 
> 
m!s(n, 
m), 
where 
(i) 
is a BINOMIAL 
COEFFICIENT, 
s(n,m) 
is a 
STIRLING 
NUMBER 
OF THE SECOND 
KIND, 
and 
ak 
= min(n,2” 
- 1). 
Special 
cases include 
p(n,

Minimal 
Surface 
Minimal 
surfaces are defined 
as surfaces with zero MEAN 
CURVATURE, 
and therefore 
satisfy 
LAGRANGE’S 
EQUA- 
TION 
(1 + fy2)fxx + 2fJvfxy 
+ (-1+ f;ea)fYY = 0. 
Minimal 
surfaces 
may 
also be characterized 
as surfaces 
of minimal 
AREA 
for given 
boundary 
conditions. 
A 
PLANE 
is a trivial 
MINIMAL 
SURFACE, 
and the first non- 
trivial 
examples 
(the 
CATENOID 
and 
HELICOID) 
were 
found 
by Meusnier 
in 1776 (Meusnier 
1785) 
l 
Euler 
proved 
that 
a minimal 
surface 
is planar 
IFF 
its 
GAUSSIAN 
CURVATURE 
is zero at every point 
so that 
it 
is locally 
SADDLE-shaped. 
The 
EXISTENCE 
of a solution 
to the general 
case was independently 
proven 
by Douglas 
(1931) 
and 
Rad6 
(1933), 
although 
their 
analysis 
could 
not 
exclude 
the 
possibility 
of singularities. 
Osserman 
(1970) 
and 
Gulliver 
(1973) 
showed 
that 
a minimizing 
solution 
cannot 
have singularities. 
The 
only 
known 
complete 
(boundaryless), 
embedded 
(no self-intersections) 
minimal 
surfaces 
of finite 
topol- 
ogy known 
for 200 years were the CATENOID, 
HELICOID, 
and 
PLANE. 
Hoffman 
discovered 
a three-ended 
GENUS 
1 minimal 
embedde.d 
surface, 
and demonstrated 
the ex- 
istence 
of an infinite 
number 
of such surfaces. 
A four- 
ended 
embedded 
minimal 
surface 
has also been 
found. 
L. Bers proved 
that 
any finite 
isolated 
SINGULARITY 
of 
a single-valued 
paramet 
erized minimal 
surface is remov- 
able. 
A surface 
can be parameterized 
using 
a ISOTHERMAL 
PARAMETERIZATION. 
Such a parameterization 
is mini- 
mal 
if the coordinate 
functions 
xk are HARMONIC, 
i.e., 
&(<) 
are ANALYTIC. 
A minimal 
surface 
can therefore 
be defined 
by a triple 
of ANALYTIC 
FUNCTIONS 
such 
that 
4k+k 
= 0. The 
REAL 
parameterization 
is then 
ob- 
tained 
as 
xk 
= 
R 
s 
+k(c) 
dC’.

Minkowski-Bouligand 
Dimension 
In many 
cases, the 
HAUSDORFF 
DIMENSION 
correctly 
describes 
the correction 
term 
for a resonator 
with 
FRAC- 
TAL PERIMETER 
in Lorentz’s 
conjecture. 
However, 
in 
general, 
the proper 
dimension 
to use turns 
out to be the 
Minkowski-Bouligand 
dimension 
(Schroeder 
1991). 
Let F(r) 
be the AREA 
traced 
out by a small 
CIRCLE 
with

a fractal

It is conjectured 
that 
for all strictly

the 
Minkowski-Bouligand 
dimen- 
sion 
is equal 
to the

According

Miquel’s 
Theorem 
If a point 
is marked 
on each side of a TRIANGLE AABC, 
then 
the three MIQUEL CIRCLES (each through 
a VER- 
TEX and the two marked 
points 
on the adjacent 
sides)

llriangle 
Miter 
Surface 
1177 
are 
CONCURRENT 
at 
a point 
AJ 
called 
the 
MIQUEL 
POINT. 
This 
result 
is a slight 
generalization 
of the 
so- 
called 
PIVOT THEOREM. 
If lW lies in the interior 
of the triangle, 
then 
it satisfies 
LP2MP3 
= 180" - a1 
iP,MPz 
= 180" - a2 
LP&2P2 
= 180* - a3, 
The lines 
from 
the MIQUEL 
POINT to the marked 
points 
make 
equal 
angles 
with 
the respective 
sides. 
(This 
is a 
by-product 
of the MIQUEL EQUATION.) 
L4 
Given 
four 
lines

, + . , Ld each intersecting 
the 
other 
three, 
the four 
MIQUEL CIRCLES passing 
through 
each 
subset 
of three 
intersection 
points 
of the lines 
meet 
in a 
point 
known 
as the 4-Miquel 
point 
AL 
Furthermore, 
the 
centers 
of these 
four 
MIQUEL CIRCLES lie on a CIRCLE 
Cd (Johnson 
1929, 
p. 139). 
The 
lines 
from 
iW to given 
points 
on the sides 
make 
equal ANGLES with 
respect 
to 
the sides. 
Similarly, 
given 
n lines 
taken 
by (n- 
1)s yield 
n MIQUEL

A TORUS 
can be cut into 
a MGbius 
strip 
with 
an EVEN 
number 
of half-twists, 
and a KLEIN 
BOTTLE 
can be cut 
in half 
along 
its length 
to make 
two Mijbius 
strips. 
In 
addition, 
two strips 
on top 
of each other, 
each with 
a 
half-twist, 
give a single 
strip 
with 
four twists 
when dis- 
entangled. 
There 
are three 
possible 
SURFACES 
which 
can be ob- 
tained 
by sewing 
a Mijbius 
strip 
to the edge of a DISK: 
the BOY 
SURFACE, 
CROSS-CAP, 
and ROMAN 
SURFACE. 
The 
Miibius 
strip 
has EULER 
CHARACTERISTIC

the 
HEAWOOD 
CONJECTURE 
therefore 
shows that 
any 
set of regions 
on it can be colored 
using 
six-colors 
only.

Mijbius 
Transformation 
A transformation 
of the form 
ax + b 
w=m=a+ 
where a, b, c, d f c and 
ad - bc # 0, 
is a CONFORMAL'TRANSFORMATION 
and 
is called 
a 
Mijbius 
transformation. 
It is linear 
in both 
w and z. 
Every 
Mobius 
transformation 
except 
f(r) 
= x has one or 
two FIXED 
POINTS. 
The 
Mijbius 
transformation 
sends 
CIRCLES 
and lines 
to CIRCLES 
or lines. 
MSbius 
trans- 
formations 
preserve 
symmetry. 
The 
CROSS-RATIO 
is 
invariant 
under 
a Mijbius 
transformation. 
A Mijbius 
transformation 
is a composition 
of translations, 
rota- 
tions, 
magnifications, 
and inversions. 
To determine 
a particular 
Mijbius 
transformation, 
spec- 
ify the map 
of three 
points 
which 
preserve 
orientation. 
A particular 
MGbius 
transformation 
is then 
uniquely 

MG bius Triangks 
Modified 
Bessel Differential 
Eauation

determined. 
To determine 
a general 
Mijbius 
transfor- 
mation, 
pick 
two symmetric 
points 
Q! and as, 
Define 
p E f(a), 
restricting 
fl as required. 
Compute 
0~. 
f(as) 
then 
equals 
ps 
since 
the 
Mijbius 
transformation 
pre- 
serves symmetry 
(the 
SYMMETRY 
PRINCIPLE). 
Plug 
in 
Q! and CYS into 
the general 
MGbius 
transformation 
and 
set equal 
to p and /3s. 
Without 
loss of generality, 
let 
c = 
1 and solve for a and 
b in terms 
of p. 
Plug 
back 
into 
the general 
expression 
to obtain 
a Mijbius 
transfor- 
mation.

Locking 
A phenomenon 
in which 
a system 
being 
forced 
at an 
IRRATIONAL period 
undergoes 
rational, 
periodic 
motion 
which persists 
for a finite 
range of forcing 
values. 
It may 
occur 
for strong 
couplings 
between 
natural 
and forcing 
oscillation 
frequencies. 
The phenomenon 
can be exemplified 
in the CIRCLE 
MAP 
when, after Q iterations 
of the map, 
the new angle differs 
from 
the initial 
value 
by a RATIONAL NUMBER 
0 n+q=e,+P-. 4

The formation

are successes of this kind. 
The theory 
of

Modular 
Angle 
Given 
a MODULUS k in an ELLIPTIC 
INTEGRAL, the 
modular 
angle 
is defined 
by k = sin QI. An ELLIPTIC 
INTEGRAL is written 
I($lm) 
when 
the PARAMETER is 
used, I(+, k) 
h 
w 
en the MODULUS is used, 
and 
I($\ctl) 
when the modular 
angle 
is used.

Modular 
Form 
A modular 
form 
is a function 
in the COMPLEX PLANE 
with 
rather 
spectacular 
and special 
properties 
resulting 
from 
a surprising 
array 
of internal 
symmetries. 
If 
= (cz + d)2F(z), 
then 
F(z) 
is said to be a modular 
form 
of weight 
2 and 
level N. 
If it is correctly 
parameterized, 
a modular 
form 
is ANALYTIC 
and vanishes 
at the cusps, 
so it is called 

Modular 
Fhction

a CUSP 
FORM. 
It is also an eigenform 
under 
a certain 
HECKE 
ALGEBRA. 
A remarkable 
connection 
between 
rational 
ELLIPTIC 
CURVES 
and modular 
forms 
is given 
by the TANIYAMA- 
SHIMURA 
CONJECTURE, 
which 
states 
that 
any rational 
ELLIPTIC 
CURVE 
is a modular 
form 
in disguise.

by Andrew

Mm 
is a CYCLIC

(which

IFF 
m is of one of the forms

the explicit

of Qb (i.e., 
52 = 25), 
and the last term 
is omitted 
if ai = 1. If pl = 2, write 
(5) 
Now combine 
terms 
from 
the odd and even primes. 
For 
example, 
consider 
m = 
104 = 23 
l 13. 
The 
only 
odd 
prime 
factor 
is 13, so factoring 
gives

M, 
and 1M, are isomorphic 
IFF @m and & 
are identical. 
More 
specifically, 
the abstract 
GROUP 
corresponding 
to 
a given 
Mm 
can be determined 
explicitly 
in terms 
of a 
DIRECT 
PRODUCT 
of CYCLIC 
GROUPS 
of the so-called 
CHARACTERISTIC 
FACTORS, 
whose product 
is 
denoted 
a,. 
This 
representation 
is obtained 
from 
& 
as the set 
of products 
of largest 
powers 
of each factor 
of #m. 
For 
example, 
for &rod, the largest 
power 
of 2 is 4 = 22 and 
the largest 
power of 3 is 3 = 3l, so the first characteristic 
factor is 4 x 3 = 12, leaving 
2.2 (i.e., only powers of two). 
The 
largest 
power 
remaining 
is 2 = 2l, 
so the second 
CHARACTERISTIC 
FACTOR 
is 2, leaving 
2, which 
is the 
third 
and 
last 
CHARACTERISTIC 
FACTOR. 
Therefore, 
a104 
= 
2 
l 2 . 4, and 
the 
group 
Mm 
is isomorphic 
to 
Zz@Z2@~4*

Monkey 
and 
Coconut 
Problem 
A DIOPHANT~NE 
problem 
(i.e., one whose solution 
must 
be given 
in terms 
of INTEGERS) 
which 
seeks a solution 
to the 
following 
problem. 
Given 
n men 
and 
a pile 
of 
coconuts, 
each 
man 
in sequence 
takes 
(l/n)th 
of the 
coconuts 
and gives the KQ coconuts 
which 
do not divide 
equally 
to a monkey. 
When 
all 72 men have so divided, 
they 
divide 
the remaining 
coconuts 
five ways, and give 
the vz coconuts 
which 
are left-over 
to the monkey. 
How 
many 
coconuts 
N were there 
originally? 
The 
solution 
is 
equivalent 
to solving 
the n+l 
DIOPHANTINE 
EQUATIONS 
N=nA+m 
(n-I)A=nB+m 
( n- 
l)B=nCfm 
( n- 
l)X=nY+m 
( n - 1)Y =nZ+m, 
and is given 
by 
N = knn+’ 
- m(n 
- l), 
where k is an an arbitrary 
INTEGER 
(Gardner 
1961). 
For the particular 
case of n = 5 men 
and 
m = 1 left 
over coconuts, 
the 6 equations 
can be combined 
into the 
single 
DI~PHANTINE 
EQUATION 
1,024N 
= 15,625F 
+ 11,529, 
where 
F is the number 
given 
to each man 
in the last 
division. 
The 
smallest 
POSITIVE 
solution 
in this case is 
N- 
15,621 
coconuts, 
corresponding 
to k = 1 and F = 
1,023 
(Gardner 
1961). 
The 
following 
table 
shows how 
this 
rather 
large 
number 
of coconuts 
is divided 
under 
the scheme 
described 
above.

If no coconuts 
are left for the monkey 
after the final 
VP 
way division 
(Williams 
1926), 
then 
the original 
number 
of coconuts 
is

n odd 
(n - 1 + r,k)n”

The smallest

for case n = 5 and m =

coconuts, 
corresponding 
to !C = 1 and 
1,020 coconuts 
in the final 
division 
(Gardner 
1961).

Monty 
Hall 
Dilemma 
see MONTY 
HALL 
PROBLEM 
Monty 
Hall 
Problem 
The 
Monty 
Hall 
problem 
is named 
for its similarity 
to 
the Let’s 
1Muke a Deal 
television 
game 
show hosted 
by 
Monty 
Hall. 
The problem 
is stated 
as follows. 
Assume 
that 
a room 
is equipped 
with 
three 
doors. 
Behind 
two 
are goats, 
and behind 
the third 
is a shiny 
new car. You 
are asked to pick a door, 
and will win whatever 
is behind 
it. 
Let’s 
say you pick 
door 
1. Before 
the door is opened, 
however, 
someone 
who knows 
what’s 
behind 
the doors 
(Monty 
Hall) 
opens ooze of the other 
two doors, 
revealing 
a goat, 
and asks you if you wish to change 
your selection 
to the third 
door (i.e., the door which neither 
you picked 
nor he opened). 
The 
Monty 
Hall 
problem 
is deciding 
whether 
you do. 
The 
correct 
answer 
is that 
you 
do want 
to switch. 
If 
you do not switch, 
you have the expected 
l/3 
chance 
of 
winning 
the car, since 
no matter 
whether 
you initially 
picked 
the correct 
door, 
Monty 
will show you a door with 
a goat. 
But 
after Monty 
has eliminated 
one of the doors 
for you, 
you obviously 
do not improve 
your 
chances 
of 
winning 
to better 
than 
l/3 
by sticking 
with your original 
choice. 
If you now switch 
doors, 
however, 
there 
is a 2/3 
chance 
you will win the car (counterintuitive 
though 
it 
seems) 
l 
& 
dz 
Winning 
Probability 
pick 
stick 
l/3

switch 
2/ 3 
The problem 
can be generalized 
to four doors as follows. 
Let one door conceal 
the car, with goats behind 
the other 
three. 
Pick 
a door 
dl. 
Then 
the host 
will 
open 
one of 
the 
nonwinners 
and 
give 
you the 
option 
of switching. 
Call 
your 
new choice 
(which 
could 
be the same as dl if 
you don’t 
switch) 
d2. The 
host will 
then 
open a second 
nonwinner, 
and 
you 
must 
decide 
for choice 
da if you 
want 
to stick 
to dz or switch 
to the 
remaining 
door. 
The 
probabilities 
of winning 
are shown 
below 
for the 
four possible 
strategies.

The above results 
are characteristic

for the n-stage 
Monty

problem: 
stick 
until 
the last 
choice, 
then 
switch.

Multiamicable

Two integers 
72 and m < n are (a, P)-multiamicable 
if 
a(m) 
-m 
= an 
and 
u(n) 
- n = pm, 
where o(n) 
is the DIVISOR 
FUNCTION 
and a, p are POS-

integers. 
If a = 0 = 
1, (m,n) 
is an AMICABLE

m cannot 
have just 
one distinct 
prime 
factor, 
and if it 
has precisely 
two prime 
factors, 
then 
a = 1 and m is 
EVEN.

Multiplication 
In simple 
algebra, 
multiplication 
is the process 
of cal- 
culating 
the result 
when 
a number 
a is taken 
b times. 
The 
result 
of a multiplication 
is called 
the PRODUCT 
of 
a and 
b. It is denoted 
a x b, a 
l b, (a)(b), 
or simply 
ab. 
The 
symbol 
x is known 
as the 
MULTIPLICATION 
SIGN. 
Normal 
multiplication 
is ASSOCIATIVE, 
COMMUTATIVE, 
and DISTRIBUTIVE. 
More 
generally, 
multiplication 
can also be defined 
for 
other 
mathematical 
objects 
such as GROUPS, 
MATRI- 
CES, SETS, and TENSORS. 
Karatsuba 
and Ofman 
(1962) 
discovered 
that 
multipli- 
cation 
of two n digit 
numbers 
can be done with 
a BIT 
COMPLEXITY 
of less than 
n2 using 
an algorithm 
now 
known 
as KARATSUBA 
MULTIPLICATION.

Digital 
Root 
Consider 
the 
process 
of taking 
a number, 
multiplying 
its DIGITS, 
then 
multiplying 
the 
DIGITS 
of numbers 
de- 
rived 
from 
it, etc., until 
the remaining 
number 
has only 
one DIGIT. 
The 
number 
of multiplications 
required 
to 
obtain 
a single 
DIGIT 
from 
a number 
n is called 
the 
MULTIPLICATIVE 
PERSISTENCE 
of n, and the DIGIT 
ob- 
tained 
is called 
the multiplicative 
digital 
root 
of n. 
For example, 
the 
sequence 
obtained 
from 
the 
starting 
number 
9876 
is (9876, 
3024, 
0), so 9876 
has a MUL- 
TIPLICATIVE 
PERSISTENCE 
of two and a multiplicative 
digital 
root 
of 0. The 
multiplicative 
digital 
roots 
of the

a single

of steps required 
is known 
as the

and the final DIGIT

Rook 
of n. 
For 
example, 
the sequence 
obtained 
from 
the starting 
number 
9876 
is (9876, 
3024, 
0), so 9876 has an mul- 
tiplicative 
persistence 
of two 
and 
a MULTIPLICATIVE 
DIGITAL

of 0. 
The 
multiplicative

(Sloane’s

There 
is no number 
< 105’ 
with 
multiplicative 
persistence 
> 11. 
The 
multiplicative 
persistence 
of an ~-DIGIT 
number 
is 
also called 
its LENGTH. 
The 
maximum 
lengths 
for 72 = 
2-, 3-, . . . ) digit 
numbers 
are 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10,

AOl4553; 
(Beeler 
et al. 1972, Item 
56; 
Gottlieb 
1969-1970). 
The 
concept 
of multiplicative 
persistence 
can be gener- 
alized 
to multiplying 
the kth 
powers 
of the digits 
of a 
number 
and iterating 
until 
the result 
remains 
constant. 
All 
numbers 
other 
than 
REPUNITS, 
which 
converge 
to 
1, converge 
to 0. The 
number 
of iterations 
required 
for 
the 
kth 
powers 
of a number’s 
digits 
to converge 
to 0 
is called 
its k-multiplicative 
persistence.

Miintz 
Space 
A Miintz 
space is a technically 
defined 
SPACE 
M(A) G span{zXo, 
&, 
. . .} 
which 
arises in the study 
of function 
approximations. 
Miintz’s 
Theorem 
Miintz’s 
theorem 
is a generalization 
of the WEIERSTRAJ~ 
APPROXIMATION THEOREM, which 
statesthatany 
con- 
tinuous 
function 
on a closed 
and bounded 
interval 
can 
be uniformly 
approximated 
by POLYNOMIALS involv- 
ing constants 
and any INFINITE SEQUENCE of POWERS 
whose RECIPROCALS diverge. 
In technical 
language, 
Miintz’s 
theorem 
states 
that 
the 
M~~NTZ SPACE Iw(A) 
is dense in CIO, 11 IFF

Mutant 
Knot 
Given 
an original 
KNOT K, 
the three 
knots 
produced 
by MUTATION together 
with 
K itself 
are called 
mutant 
knots. 
Mutant 
knots 
are often 
difficult 
to distinguish. 
For instant, 
mutants 
have the same 
HOMFLY 
POLY- 
NOMIALS and HYPERBOLIC KNOT volume. 
Many 
but 
not all mutants 
also have the same GENUS (KNOT). 
Mutation 
Consider 
a KNOT as being 
formed 
from 
two TANGLES. 
The 
following 
three 
operations 
are called 
mutations. 
1. Cut 
the knot 
open 
along 
four 
points 
on each of the 
four strings 
coming 
out of Z& flipping 
572 over, 
and 
gluing 
the strings 
back 
together. 
2. Cut 
the knot 
open 
along 
four 
points 
on each of the 
four strings 
coming 
out of Tz, flipping 
T2 to the right, 
and gluing 
the strings 
back 
together. 
3. Cut 
the knot, 
rotate 
it by 180”, 
and reglue. 
This 
is 
equivalent 
to performing 
(1), 
then 
(2). 
Mutations 
applied 
to an alternating 
KNOT projection 
always yield 
an ALTERNATING 
KNOT. The 
mutation 
of 
a KNOT is always another 
KNOT (a opposed 
to a LINK).

Naive 
Set Theory 
A branch 
of mathematics 
which 
attempts 
to formalize 
the nature 
of the SET using 
a minimal 
collection 
of in- 
dependent 
axioms. 
Unfortunately, 
as discovered 
by its 
earliest 
proponents, 
naive 
set theory 
quickly 
runs into 
a 
number 
of PARADOXES (such as RUSSELL’S 
PARADOX), 
so a less sweeping 
and 
more 
formal 
theory 
known 
as 
AXIOMATIC 
SET THEORY 
must 
be used.

EQUILIBRHJM 
A closely 
related 
set of numbers 
generalize 
the narcissis- 
tic number 
to ~-DIGIT 
numbers 
which 
are the sums of 
any single 
POWER 
of their 
DIGITS. 
For example, 
4150 
is a ~-DIGIT 
number 
which 
is the sum of fifth 
POWERS 
of its DIGITS. 
Since the number 
of digits 
is not equal 
to 
the power to which they are taken 
for such numbers, 
it is 
not a narcissistic 
number. 
The 
smallest 
numbers 
which 
are sums of any single 
positive 
power of their 
digits 
are 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 153, 370, 371, 407, 1634, 
4150, 
4151,

l . . 
(Sloane’s

The smallest 
numbers 
which 
are equal to the nth powers 
of their

for n = 3, 4, . l . , are 153, 
1634, 
4150, 
548834, 
1741725, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
A003321). 
The

equal 
to the sum

Equation 
A natural 
equation 
is an equation 
which specifies 
a curve 
independent 
of any choice 
of coordinates 
or parameter- 
ization. 
The study 
of natural 
equations 
began 
with 
the 
following 
problem: 
given 
two functions 
of one parame- 
ter, find 
the SPACE CURVE for which 
the functions 
are 
the CURVATURE and TORSION. 
Euler 
gave an integral 
solution 
for plane 
curves 
(which 
always have TORSION 7 = 0). Call the ANGLE between 
the TANGENT 
line 
to the curve 
and 
the X-AXIS 4 the 
TANGENTIAL 
ANGLE, 
then 
where E is the CURVATURE. Then 
the equations 
where 7 is the TORSION, are solved 
by the 
equations 
parametric

7 = 0, 
(3)

cos q5 ds 
curve 
with 
Y= 
I 
sin 4 ds. 
(5) 
The equations 
fi = E(S) and 7 = T(S) are called 
the nat- 
ural 
(or INTRINSIC) 
equations 
of the space curve. 
An 
equation 
expressing 
a plane 
curve in terms 
of s and RA- 
DIUS OF CURVATURE R (orK)iscalleda 
CES~RO EQUA- 
TION, and an equation 
expressing 
a plane 
curve in terms 
ofs 
and $is 
called 
a WHEWELL 
EQUATION. 
Among 
the special 
planar 
cases which 
can be solved 
in 
terms 
of elementary 
functions 
are the CIRCLE, LOGA- 
RITHMIC SPIRAL, CIRCLE INVOLUTE, and 
EPICYCLOID. 
Enneper 
showed that 
each of these is the projection 
of a 
HELIX 
on a CONIC 
surface 
of revolution 
along 
the axis 
of symmetry. 
The 
above 
cases correspond 
to the CYL-

and SPHERE.

Net 
A generalization 
of a SEQUENCE 
used in general 
topol- 
ogy and 
ANALYSIS 
when, the 
spaces 
being 
dealt 
with 
are not FIRST-COUNTABLE. 
(Sequences 
provide 
an ad- 
equate 
way of dealing 
with 
CONTINUITY 
for FIRST- 
COUNTABLE SPACES.) Nets 
are used 
in the study 
of 
the RIEMANN INTEGRAL.

Net 
(Polyhedron) 
A plane 
diagram 
in which 
the EDGES of a POLYHEDRON 
are shown. 
All 
convex 
POLYHEDRA have nets, 
but 
not 
all 
concave 
polyhedra 
do (the 
constituent 
POLYGONS 
can overlap 
one another 
when a concave 
POLYHEDRON 
is flattened 
out). 
The 
GREAT DODECAHEDRON and 
STELLA OCTANGWLA are examples 
of a concave 
poly- 
hedron 
which 
have nets. 
Netto’s 
Conjecture 
The probability 
that 
two elements 
P-1 and & 
of a SYM- 
METRIC GROUP generate 
the entire 
GROUP 
tends to 3/4 
as ?z + 
00. This 
was proven 
by Dixon 
in 1967.

Closed 
“extended” 
rules 
use multiple 
copies 
of lower

closed

to build 
up higher

By 
appropriately 
tailoring 
this 
process, 
rules with

can be constructed. 
For n tabulated

using the TRAPEZOIDAL

Newton’s 
Diverging 
Parabolas 
Curves 
with 
CARTESIAN 
equation 
uy2 = x(x2 - 2bx + c) 
with 
a > 0. 
The 
above 
equation 
represents 
the third 
class of Newton’s 
classification 
of CUBIC 
CURVES, 
which 
Newton 
divided 
into 
five 
species 
depending 
on 
the 
ROOTS 
of the cubic 
in x on the right-hand 
side of the 
equation. 
Newton 
described 
these 
cases as having 
the 
following 
characteristics: 
“All 
the 
ROOTS 
are REAL 
and 
unequal. 
Then 
the 
Figure 
is a diverging 
Parabola 
of the Form 
of a Bell, 
with 
an Oval 
at its Vertex. 
Two 
of the 
ROOTS 
are equal. 
A PARABOLA 
will 
be formed, 
either 
Nodated 
by touching 
an Oval, 
or 
Punctate, 
by having 
the Oval 
infinitely 
small. 
The 
three 
ROOTS 
are equal. 
This 
is the 
NEILIAN 
PARABOLA, 
commonly 
called 
SEMI-CUBICAL. 
Only 
one REAL 
ROOT. 
If two of the 
ROUTS 
are 
impossible, 
there will be a Pure 
PARABOLA 
of a Bell- 
like 
Form”

SQUARE 
ROOT 
Newton’s 
Method 
A ROOT-finding 
ALGORITHM 
which 
uses the first 
few 
terms 
of the 
TAYLOR 
SERIES 
in the vicinity 
of a sus- 
pected 
ROOT 
to zero in on the root. 
The 
TAYLOR 
SE- 
RIES of a function 
f(x) 
about 
the point 
x + E is given 
bY 
f(x+c)= 
f(x)+f’(x)~+~ff’(x)E2+mm~~ 
(1) 
Keeping 
terms 
only 
to first order, 
f (x + E) = f(x) + f’(X)E. 
(2) 
This 
expression 
can be used to estimate 
the amount 
of 
offset E needed 
to land 
closer to the root 
starting 
from 
an initial 
guess x0. 
Setting 
f (x0 + E) = 0 and solving 
(2) for E gives 
which 
is the first-order 
adjustment 
to the ROOT'S 
posi- 
tion. 
By letting 
xl = x0 + ~0, calculating 
a new ~1, and 
so on, the process 
can be repeated 
until 
it converges 
to 
a root. 
Unfortunately, 
this 
procedure 
can be unstable 
near 
a 
horizontal 
ASYMPTOTE 
or a LOCAL 
MINIMUM. 
HOW- 
ever, with 
a good 
initial 
choice 
of the ROOT'S 
position, 
the algorithm 
can by applied 
iteratively 
to obtain 
f (xd

for n = 1, 2, 3, . . m .

Therefore, 
when 
the 
method 
converges, 
it 
does 
so 
quadratically. 
A FRACTAL 
is obtained 
by applying 
Newton’s 
method 
to 
finding 
a ROOT 
of zn - 1 = 0 (Mandelbrot 
1983, Gleick 
1988, Peitgen 
and Saupe

there 
are n

the algorithm 
can converge.

Nim-Value 
Every 
position 
of every 
IMPARTIAL 
GAME 
has a nim- 
value, 
making 
it equivalent 
to a NIM-HEAP. 
To find the 
nim-value 
(also called 
the SPRAGUE-GRUNDY 
NUMBER), 
take 
the 
MEX 
of the nim-values 
of the possible 
moves. 
The 
nim-value 
can also be found 
by writing 
the num- 
ber of counters 
in each heap 
in binary, 
adding 
without 
carrying, 
and replacing 
the digits 
with 
their 
values 
mod 
2. If the nim-value 
is 0, the position 
is SAFE; 
otherwise, 
it is UNSAFE. 
With 
two heaps, 
safe positions 
are (x, z) 
where x E [l, 71. With 
three 
heaps,

If the GAUSS

a NEIGHBORHOOD 
of the SPHERE, 
then 
the surface 
is a

This 
was proven 
by Osserman

Xavier

subsequently 
generalized 
the result 
as follows. 
If

The actual

An analogous

can be used to solve an overde-

arise when

can be solved 
for dX using 
standard

This

applied

applying 
this procedure

Note

The

Neither

so must 
be either

NP-Complete 
Problem 
A problem

is both 
NP 
(solvable 
in nondetermin- 
istic POLYNOMIAL time) 
and 
NP-HARD 
(can be trans- 
lated 
into 
any other 
NP-PROBLEM).

of NP-

problems 
include 
the HAMILTONIAN 
CYCLE and 
TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEMS. 
In a landmark 
paper, 
Karp 
(1972)

A problem

if an ALGORITHM 
for solving 
it 
can be translated 
into 
one for solving 
any other 
NP- 
PROBLEM (nondeterministic 
POLYNOMIAL time) 
prob- 
lem. 
NP-hard 
therefore 
means 
“at least 
as hard 
as any 
NP-PROBLEM," 
although 
it might, 
in fact, be harder.

NP-Problem 
A problem 
is assigned 
to 
the 
NP 
(nondeterministic 
POLYNOMIAL time) 
class if it is solvable 
in polynomial 
time 
by a nondeterministic 
TURING MACHINE. (A non- 
deterministic 
TURING MACHINE is a “parallel” 
TURING 
MACHINE which 
can take 
many 
computational 
paths 
simultaneously, 
with 
the 
restriction 
that 
the 
parallel 
Turing 
machines 
cannot 
communicate.) 
A P-PROBLEM 
(whose solution 
time 
is bounded 
by a polynomial) 
is al- 
ways also NP. 
If a solution 
to an NP 
problem 
is known, 
it can be reduced 
to a single 
P (POLYNOMIAL time) 
ver- 
ification. 
LINEAR PROGRAMMING, long 
known 
to be 
NP 
and 
thought 
not to be P, was shown to be P by L. Khachian 
in 1979. 
It is not known 
if all apparently 
NP 
problems 
are actually 
P. 
A problem 
is said to be NP-HARD 
if an ALGORITHM 
for solving 
it can be translated 
into 
one for solving 
any 
other 
NP-problem 
problem. 
It is much 
easier 
to show 
that 
a problem 
is NP 
than 
to show that 
it is NP-HARD. 
A problem 
which 
is both 
NP 
and NP-HARD 
is called 
an 
NP-COMPLETE 
PROBLEM.

Number 
The 
word 
“number” 
is a general 
term 
which 
refers to a 
member 
of a given 
(possibly 
ordered) 
SET. The meaning 
of “number” 
is often 
clear from 
context 
(i.e., does it re- 
fer to a COMPLEX NUMBER,INTEGER,REAL 
NUMBER, 
etc.?). 
Wherever 
possible 
in this work, 
the word 
“num- 
ber” 
is used to refer to quantities 
which 
are INTEGERS, 
and 
TONSTANT" 
is reserved 
for nonintegral 
numbers 
which 
have a fixed 
value. 
Because 
terms 
such as REAL 
NUMBER,BERNOULLINUMBER, 
and IRRATIONAL NUM- 
BER are commonly 
used to refer to nonintegral 
quanti- 
ties, however, 
it is not possible 
to be entirely 
consistent 
in nomenclature.

Guessing 
l3y asking 
a small 
number 
of innocent-sounding 
ques- 
tions 
about 
an unknown 
number, 
it is possible 
to re- 
construct 
the number 
with 
absolute 
certainty 
(assum- 
ing that 
the questions 
are answered 
correctly). 
Ball 
and 
Coxeter 
(1987) 
give a number 
of sets of questions 
which 
can be used. 
One of the simplest 
algorithms 
uses only three questions 
to determine 
an unknown 
number 
n: 
1. Triple 
n and announce 
if the result 
n’ = 3n is EVEN 
or 
ODD. 
2. If you were told 
that 
n’ is EVEN, 
ask the person 
to 
reveal 
the number 
n” which 
iS half of n’. 
If you were 
told 
that 
n’ is ODD, 
ask the 
person 
to reveal 
the 
number 
nr’ which 
is half of n’ + 1. 
3. Ask the person 
to reveal 
the number 
of times 
/z which 
9 divides 
evenly 
into 
n’” 
= 3rK 
The 
original 
number 
n is then 
given 
by 2k if n’ 
was 
EVEN, 
or 2k + 1 if n’ was ODD. 
For 
n 
= 
2772 even, 
n’ = 6m, n” 
= 3m, 
n”’ 
= 9m, 
k = m, so 2k = 2m = n. 
For n 
= 
2m + 1 odd, 
n’ 
= 
6m + 3, nrt 
= 
3m + 2, 
n III =9m+6,k=m,so2k+1=2m+l=n. 
Another 
method 
asks: 
1. Multiply 
the number 
n by 5. 
2. Add 
6 to the product. 
Number 
Theoretic 
Transform 
3. Multiply 
the sum by 4. 
4. Add 
9 to the product. 
5. Multiply 
the sum by 5 and reveal 
the result 
n’. 
The original 
number 
is then given 
by n = (n’- 
165)/100, 
since the above 
steps give n’ = 5(4(5n+6)+9) 
= lOOn+ 
165.

While 
it is usually

easier 
to compute 
a DERIVA- 
TIVE instead 
of an INTEGRAL (which 
is a little 
strange, 
considering 
that 
“more”

than 
derivatives), 
there 
are still 
many 
applications 
where

need to be computed 
numerically. 
The

Numerical 
Integration 
The 
approximate 
computation 
of an INTEGRAL. 
The 
numerical 
computation 
of an INTEGRAL is sometimes 
called QUADRATURE. There 
are a wide range of methods 
available 
for numerical 
integration. 
A good 
source 
for 
such techniques 
is Press 
et al. (1992). 
The 
most 
straightforward 
numerical 
integration 
tech- 
nique 
uses the NEWTON-C• 
TES FORMULAS 
(also called 
QUADRATURE FORMULAS), which 
approximate 
a func- 
tion 
tabulated 
at a sequent 
of regularly 
spaced 
INTER- 
VALS by various 
degree POLYNOMIALS. If the endpoints 
are tabulated, 
then 
the 
2- and 
3-point 
formulas 
are 
called 
the TRAPEZOIDAL 
RULE and SIMPSON'S RULE, 
respectively. 
The 
5-point 
formula 
is called 
BODE'S 
RULE. A generalization 
of the TRAPEZOIDAL RULE is 
R~MBERG 
INTEGRATION, 
which 
can yield 
accurate 
re- 
sults for many 
fewer function 
evaluations. 
If the functions 
are known 
analytically 
instead 
of being 
tabulated 
at equally 
spaced 
intervals, 
the best numeri- 
cal method 
of integration 
is called 
GAUSSIAN QUADRA- 
TURE. By picking 
the abscissas 
at which to evaluate 
the 
function, 
Gaussian 
quadrature 
produces 
the most 
accu- 
rate approximations 
possible. 
However, 
given 
the speed 
of modern 
computers, 
the additional 
complication 
of the 
GAUSSIAN QUADRATURE formalism 
often 
makes 
it less 
desirable 
than 
simply 
brute-force 
calculating 
twice 
as 
many 
points 
on a regular 
grid 
(which 
also permits 
the 
already 
computed 
values 
of the function 
to be re-used).

Oblate 
Spheroid 
A “squashed” 
SPHEROID 
for which the equatorial 
radius 
a is greater 
than 
the polar 
radius 
c, so a > c. To first 
approximation, 
the 
shape 
assumed 
by a rotating 
fluid 
(including 
the Earth, 
which 
is “fluid” 
over astronomical 
time 
scales) is an oblate 
spheroid. 
The 
oblate 
spheroid 
can be specified 
parametrically 
equations 
(for a SPHEROID 
with 
axis), 
by the usual 
SPHEROID 
Z-AXIS 
as the symmetry 
x = asinwcosu 
(1) 
y = asinusinu 
z = ccos21, 
(2) 
(3) 
with 
a > c, u E [0,27r), 
and 
2t E [O, ~1. 
Its Cartesian 
equation 
is

of an oblate

A 
An obtuse 
triangle 
is a TRIANGLE in which 
one of the 
ANGLES is an OBTUSE ANGLE. (Obviously,onlyasingle 
ANGLE in a TRIANGLE~~~ 
be OBTUSELY it wouldn’t 
be 
a TRIANGLE.) 
A triangle 
must 
be either 
obtuse, 
ACUTE, 
or RIGHT. 
A famous 
problem 
is to find the chance that 
three 
points 
picked 
randomly 
in a PLANE are the VERTICES of an 
obtuse 
triangle 
(Eisenberg 
and 
Sullivan 
1996). 
Unfor- 
tunately, 
the 
solution 
of the 
problem 
depends 
on the 
procedure 
used to pick 
the 
“random” 
points 
(Portnoy 
1994). 
In fact, it is impossible 
to pick random 
variables 
which 
are uniformly 
distributed 
in the plane 
(Eisenberg 
and 
Sullivan 
1996). 
Guy 
(1993) 
gives a variety 
of so- 
lutions 
to the 
problem. 
Woolhouse 
(1886) 
solved 
the 
problem 
by picking 
uniformly 
distributed 
points 
in the 
unit 
DISK, 
and obtained 
P2 = 1- 
($ 
- ;) 
=; 
- f 
=0.719715....

The 
problem 
was generalized 
by Hall 
(1982) 
to n-D 
BALL TRIANGLE 
PICKING, 
and 
Buchta 
(1986) 
gave 
closed form 
evaluations 
for Hall’s 
integrals. 
A

B 
Lewis 
Carroll 
(1893) 
posed 
and 
gave another 
solution 
to the problem 
as follows. 
Call 
the 
longest 
side of a 
TRIANGLE AB, 
and call the DIAMETER 2~. Draw 
arcs 
from 
A and I3 of RADIUS 
2~. Because 
the longest 
side of 
the TRIANGLE is defined 
to be AB, 
the third 
VERTEX 
of the TRIANGLE must 
lie within 
the region 
ABCA. 
If 
the third 
VERTEX lies within 
the SEMICIRCLE, the TRI- 
ANGLE is an obtuse 
triangle. 
If the VERTEX lies 072 the 
SEMICIRCLE (which 
will happen 
with 
probability 
O), the 
TRIANGLE is a RIGHT TRIANGLE. 
Otherwise, 
it is an 
ACUTE TRIANGLE. 
The 
chance 
of obtaining 
an obtuse 
triangle 
is then 
the ratio 
of the AREA of the SEMICIRCLE 
to that 
of ABCA. 
The AREA of ABCA 
is then 
twice the 
AREA ofa 
SECTOR minus the AREA of the TRIANGLE.

Odd 
Function 
An odd function 
is a function 
for which 
f(s) 
= -f(-s). 
An EVEN FUNCTION times 
an odd function 
is odd. 
Odd 
Number 
An INTEGER of the form 
Iv 
= 2n + 1, where 
n is an 
INTEGER. The 
odd numbers 
are therefore 
. . . , -3,

l 
(Sloane’s 
A005408), 
which 
are also the 
GNOMIC NUMBERS. The 
GENERATING FUNCTION for 
the odd numbers 
is 
x(1 + 2) = 
( 
1)” 
x + 3x2 + 5x3 + 7x4 + . . . . 
2 - 
Since the odd numbers 
leave a remainder 
of 1 when di- 
vided 
by two, N E 1 (mod 
2) for odd N. 
Integers 
which 
are not odd are called 
EVEN.

If the function

Open 
Set 
A SET is open if every point 
in the set has a NEIGHBOR- 
HOOD 
lying 
in the 
set. 
An open 
set of RADIUS T and 
center 
x0 is the set of all points 
x such that 
Ix - x0 1 < r, 
and 
is denoted 
&(x0). 
In l-space, 
the open 
set is an 
OPEN 
INTERVAL. 
In 2-space, 
the open set is a DISK. 
In 
&space, 
the open 
set is a BALL. 
The 
complement 
of an open 
set is a CLOSED 
SET. 
It is 
possible 
for a set to be neither 
open 
nor CLOSED, 
e.g., 
the interval 
(0, 11.

assigns to every function 
f E f’“‘(1) 
a function 
A(f) 
E f(1). 
It

Ordinal 
Number 
In informal 
usage, 
an ordinal 
number 
is an adjective 
which 
describes 
the numerical 
position 
of an object, 
e.g., 
first, 
second, 
third, 
etc. 
In technical 
mathematics, 
an ordinal 
number 
is one of 
the numbers 
in Georg 
Cantor’s 
extension 
of the WHOLE 
NUMBERS. 
The ordinal 
numbers

noted 
by Conway

(1996) 
as w = (0, 1, , , . I}. 
The 
notation 
of ordinal 
numbers 
can be a bit 
counter- 
intuitive, 
e.g., even though 
1+ 
w = w, w + I > w. 
Ordinal 
numbers 
have some other 
rather 
peculiar 
prop- 
erties. 
The sum of two ordinal 
numbers 
can take on two 
different 
values, 
the sum of three 
can take on five values.

The 
sum of n ordi- 
nals has either 
193”81b 
or 33 9 81a possible 
answers for 
n > 15 (Conway 
and Guy 
1996). 
T x w is the same as w, but w x T is equal 
w2 is larger 
than 
any number 
of the form 
w x T, w3 is 
larger 
than 
w2, and so on.

Equation 
An 
ordinary 
differential 
equation 
(frequently 
abbrevi- 
ated 
ODE) 
is an equality 
involving 
a function 
and its 
DERIVATIVES. An ODE 
of order 
72 is an equation 
of the 
form 
F(x,y,y’,...,y(“)) 
=0, 
(1) 
where 
y’ 
= 
dy/da: 
is a first 
DERIVATIVE 
with 
respect 
to x and ~(“1 
= d”y/dx” 
is an nth 
DERIVATIVE with 
respect 
to x. An ODE 
of order 
n is said to be linear 
if 
it is of the form

is also sometimes 
called 
“homogeneous.”

The 
solutions 
to 
an 
ODE 
satisfy 
EXISTENCE 
and 
UNIQUENESS properties. 
These 
can be formally 
estab- 
lished 
by PICARD'S EXISTENCE THEOREM for certain 
classes 
of ODES. 
Let 
a system 
of first-order 
ODE 
be 
given 
by 
dxi 
-- 
dt 
- 
fi(Xl7m--7Xnjt)j 
(4 
for i = 1, 
l .*, n and let the functions 
fi(x1,. 
l 
l , xn, t), 
where 
i = 1, ..,, 
n, all be defined 
in a DOMAIN D of 
the (n + 1)-D space of the variables 
~1, . . . , xn, t. Let 
these functions 
be continuous 
in D and have continuous 
first PARTIAL DERIVATIVES afi/axj 
for i = 1, . , . , n 
andj 
= 1, . . . . n in D. 
Let 
(xy,, . . ,xE) 
be in D. 
Then 
there 
exists 
a solution n of (4) given 
by 
Xl 
=x 
l(t),-,%3 
= 
&L(t) 
(5)

< t < to+8 
(where S > 0) satisfying 
the initial 
conditions 
(1953, 
pp* 667-674) 
g ive canonical 
forms 
and solutions 
for second-order 
ODES. 
While 
there 
are many 
general 
techniques 
for analyti- 
cally 
solving 
classes of ODES, 
the only practical 
solution 
technique 
for complicated 
equations 
is to use numeri- 
cal methods 
(Milne 
1970). 
The 
most 
popular 
of these 
is the RUNGE-KUTTA 
METHOD, but 
many 
others 
have 
been 
developed. 
A vast 
amount 
of research 
and huge 
numbers 
of publications 
have been 
devoted 
to the nu- 
merical 
solution 
of differential 
equations, 
both 
ordinary 
and PARTIAL (PDEs) 
as a result 
of their 
importance 
in 
fields 
as diverse 
as physics, 
engineering, 
economics, 
and 
electronics, 
X((t))= 
Xy,. 
..,Xn(t(J) 
= Xi. 
Furthermore, 
the solution 
is unique, 
so that 
if 
(6) 
Xl 
= Xi(t), 
. . . ,Xn 
= XL(t) 
(7) 
is a second 
solution 
of (4) for to - S < t < to + S sat- 
isfying 
(6), then 
xi(t) 
z x;(t) 
for to - S < t < to + 6. 
Because 
every nth-order 
ODE 
can be expressed 
as a sys- 
tem 
of n first-order 
differential 
equations, 
this theorem 
also applies 
to the single 
nth-order 
ODE. 
In general, 
an nth-order 
ODE 
has n linearly 
indepen- 
dent 
solutions. 
Furthermore, 
any linear 
combination 
of 
LINEARLY INDEPENDENT FUNCTIONS solutions 
is also a 
solution.

Quadrilateral 
If two pairs

LATERAL are pairs 
of PERPENDICULAR 
lines, the QUAD- 
RILATERAL 
is said 
to be orthocentric.

Orthocentric 
System 
A set of four points, 
one of which 
is the ORTHOCEN- 
TER of the other 
three. 
In an orthocentric 
system, 
each 
point 
is the 
ORTHOCENTER of the TRIANGLE 
of the 
other 
three, 
as illustrated 
above. 
The 
INCENTER and 
EXCENTERS of a TRIANGLE are an orthocentric 
system. 
The 
centers 
of the CIRCUMCIRCLES of an orthocentric 
system 
form 
another 
orthocentric 
system 
congruent 
to 
the first. 
The

Any ROTATION can be given 
as a composition 
of rota- 
tions 
about 
three 
axes (EULER’S 
ROTATION 
THEOREM), 
and thus can be represented 
by a 3 x 3 MATRIX operating 
on a VECTOR, 
We wish to place 
conditions 
on this 
matrix 
so that 
it 
is consistent 
with 
an ORTHOGONAL TRANSFORMATION 
(basically, 
a ROTATION or ROTOINVERSION). 
In a 
so it

a VECTOR 
must 
keep its original

be true 
that 
for i = 1, 2, 3, where 
EINSTEIN

used. 
Therefore, 
from

equation,

(UijXj)(UikXk) 
= XiXi.

it guarantees 
that

and 
ATA = I,

where AT is the MATRIX

Equation

which 
gives 
the orthogonal

Orthogonal

have special

which 
allow 
them 
to be manip-

and identified 
with 
particular 
ease.

so the

also orthogonal. 
The

one of the following:

POLYNOMIALS 
are not only 
orthogonal, 
but 
orthonormal. 
Orthogonal 
polynomials 
have 
very useful 
properties 
in 
the 
solution 
of mathematical 
and 
physical 
problems. 
Just as FOURIER 
SERIES 
provide 
a convenient 
method 
of 
expanding 
a periodic 
function 
in a series of linearly 
inde- 
pendent 
terms, 
orthogonal

provide 
a natu-

and interpret 
solutions 
to many 
typesofimportant 
DIFFERENTIAL 
EQUATIONS. 
Orthog-

The

possess 
many 
rather 
surprising 
and 
useful 
properties. 
For instance, 
let xl < x2 < . . . < xn be the ROOTS 
of the p,(x) 
with 
x0 = a and X~+I 
= b. Then 
each interval 
[xv, xv+11 for 
Y = 0, 1, 
l ... 
72 contains 
exactly 
one ROOT 
of pn+l(x). 
Between 
two ROOTS 
of pn(x) 
there 
is at least one ROOT 
of p,(x) 
for m > 72.

VALUATION THEORY. 
The 
p-adics 
were probably 
first 
introduced 
by Hensel 
in 
1902 in a paper 
which 
was concerned 
with 
the de- 
velopment 
of algebraic 
numbers 
in POWER SERIES. p- 
adic numbers 
were 
then 
generalized 
to VALUATIONS by 
Kiirsch&k 
in 1913. 
In the early 
192Os, Hasse formulated 
the LOCAL-GLOBAL PRINCIPLE (now usually 
called 
the 
HASSE PRINCIPLE), 
which 
is one of the 
chief applica- 
tions 
of LOCAL FIELD theory. 
Skolem’s 
p-adic 
method, 
1295 
which 
is used in attacking 
certain 
DIOPHANTINE EQUA- 
TIONS, is another 
powerful 
application 
of p-adic 
num- 
bers. 
Another 
application 
is the theorem 
that 
the HAR- 
MONIC NUMBERS & 
are never 
INTEGERS (except 
for 
HI 1. 
A similar 
application 
is the 
proof 
of the 
VON 
STAUDT-CLAUSEN THEOREM usingthep-adicvaluation, 
although 
the 
technical 
details 
are somewhat 
difficult. 
Yet 
another 
application 
is provided 
by the MAHLER- 
LECH THEOREM. 
Every 
RATIONAL 
x has an “essentially” 
unique 
p-adic 
expansion 
(“essentially” 
since zero terms 
can always be 
added 
at the beginning) 
00 
x= 
IE 
ajp3 1 
(10) 
j=m 
with m an INTEGER, aj the INTEGERS between 
0 and 
P - 1 inclusive, 
and where 
the sum 
is convergent 
with 
respect 
to p-adic 
valuation. 
If x # 0 and a, 
# 0, then 
the expansion 
is unique. 
Burger 
and Struppeck 
(1996) 
show that 
for p a PRIME and n a POSITIVE INTEGER, 
ln!lp = p-~"-~PoMP--l) 
1 
where the p-adic 
expansion 
of n is 
and 
n = a0 + alp + a2p2 + . . . + ALPS, 
(12) 
A,(n) 
= a0 + al + . . . + aL. 
For sufficiently 
large 
n, 
(13) 
ln!l, 
5 P --72/(2P--2) ’ 
The p-adic 
valuation 
on Q gives rise to the p-adic 
metric 
d(XYY) 
= lx - YIP1 
(15) 
which 
in turn 
gives rise to the p-adic 
topology. 
It can 
be shown 
that 
the rationals, 
together 
with 
the p-adic 
metric, 
do not form 
a COMPLETE METRIC SPACE. The 
completion 
of this 
space can therefore 
be constructed, 
and the set of p-adic 
numbers 
QP is defined 
to be this 
completed 
space. 
Just 
as the REAL NUMBERS are the completion 
of the 
RATIONALS Q with 
respect 
to the usual 
absolute 
valu- 
ation 
Ix - yl, the p-adic 
numbers 
are the completion 
of 
Q with 
respect 
to the p-adic 
valuation 
Ix - yip. 
The p- 
adic numbers 
are useful 
in solving 
DIOPHANTINE EQ~A- 
TIONS. For example, 
the equation 
X2 = 2 can easily 
be 
shown to have no solutions 
in the field of 2-adic 
numbers 
(we simply 
take 
the valuation 
of both 
sides). 
Because 
the 2-adic 
numbers 
contain 
the rationals 
as a subset, 
we 
can immediately 
see that 
the equation 
has no solutions 
in the RATIONAL% 
So we have an immediate 
proof 
of 
the irrationality 
of 4.

This 
is a common 
argument 
that 
is used in solving 
these

NUMBER,LATTICEPATH,SCHR~DER 
types 
of equations: 
in order 
to show that 
an equation 
NUMBER 
has no solutions 
in (9, we show that 
it has no solutions 
in a FIELD EXTENSION. For another 
example, 
consider 
X2 + 1 = 0. This 
equation 
has no solutions 
in Q because 
it has no solutions 
in the reals R, and Q is a subset 
of 
Et. 
Now 
consider 
the converse. 
Suppose 
we have an equa- 
tion 
that 
does have 
solutions 
in Ik and in all 
the QP. 
Can we conclude 
that 
the equation 
has a solution 
in Q? 
Unfortunately, 
in general, 
the answer is no, but there 
are 
classes of equations 
for which 
the answer 
is yes. 
Such 
equations 
are said to satisfy 
the HASSE PRINCIPLE.

HIa can be trivially

Hz0 
cannot 
be built 
up from 
smaller 
MATRICES, 
so use n = 
20 = 19 + 1 = 2(32 + 1) = 22(22 + 1). 
Only 
the first 
form 
can be used, with 
p = 19 = 4 x 5 - 1 and KQ = 1. 
We therefore 
use GF(19), 
and color 
9 RESIDUES

0 
white. 
Hz4 can be constructed 
from 
Ha 8 Hl2. 
Now consider 
a more 
complicated 
case. 
For n = 28 = 
33 + 1 = 2(13+ 
l), the only form 
having 
p = 41- 1 is the 
first, 
so use the GF(33) 
field. 
Take 
as the modulus 
the 
IRREDUCIBLE 
POLYNOMIAL

A 
four-digit 
number 
can always be written 
using only three 
digits, 
since ZOOO- 1021 E 0012 and 2000-2012 
= 0021. 
Now look 
at the moduli 
starting 
with

each

is considered 
separately.

If q is an ODD

there 
is a HADAMARD

that 
m

If nt is of this 
form, 
the 
matrix 
can be 
constructed

If m is di- 
visible 
by 4 but not of the form 
(l), 
the PALEY

Conjecture 
Apply 
the 
196~ALGORITHM, 
which 
consists 
of taking 
any POSITIVE 
INTEGER 
of two digits 
or more, 
revers- 
ing the digits, 
and adding 
to the original 
number. 
Now 
sum 
the 
two and 
repeat 
the procedure 
with 
the sum. 
Of the first 
10,000 
numbers, 
only 
251 do not produce 
a 
PALINDROMIC 
NUMBER 
in < 23 steps (Gardner 
1979). 
- 
It was therefore 
conjectured 
that 
all numbers 
will even- 
tually 
yield 
a PALINDROMIC 
NUMBER. 
However, 
the 
conjecture 
has been proven 
false for bases which 
are a 
POWER 
of 2, and seems to be false for base 10 as well. 
Among 
the first 100,000 
numbers, 
5,996 numbers 
appar- 
ently 
never 
generate 
a PALINDROMIC 
NUMBER 
(Gruen- 
berger 
1984). 
The 
first 
few are 196, 887, 
1675, 
7436,

94039, 
187088, 
1067869, 
10755470, 
. . . 
(Sloane’s 
A006960), 
It is conjectured, 
but 
not proven, 
that 
there 
are an infi- 
nite number 
of palindromic 
PRIMES. 
With 
the exception 

1302

to the bottom 
line is twice 
the CIRCLE'S RADIUS, from 
the second CIRCLE is four times 
the RADIUS, and for the 
nth CIRCLE is 2n times 
the RADIUS. The 
centers 
of the 
CIRCLES 
lie on an ELLIPSE, 
and the DIAMETER 
of the 
nth 
CIRCLE 
Cn is (l/n)th 
PERPENDICULAR distance to 
the base of the 
SEMICIRCLE. 
This 
result 
was known 
to 
Pappus, 
who referred 
to it as an ancient 
theorem 
(Hood 
1961, Cadwell 
1966, Gardner 
1979, Bankoff 
1981). 
The 
simplest 
proof 
is via INVERSIVE 
GEOMETRY. 
If T = AB/AC, 
th en the radius 
of the nth 
circle 
in the 
pappus 
chain 
is 
T 
- 
(1 - r)r 
n - 
2[n2(1 
- r)2 + T] * 
This 
equation 
can be derived 
by iteratively 
solving 
the 
QUADRATIC FORMULA generated 
by DESCARTES CIR- 
CLE 
THEOREM for the 
radius 
of the SODDY CIRCLE. 
This 
general 
result 
simplifies 
to rn. = 
l/(6 
+ n2) 
for 
T = 
2/3 
(Gardner 
1979). 
Further 
special 
cases when 
AC = 1 + AB 
are considered 
by Gaba 
(1940).

The parabola 
was studied 
by Menaechmus 
in an attempt 
to achieve CUBE DUPLICATION. 
Menaechmus 
solved the 
problem 
by finding 
the intersection 
of the two parabolas 
X2 
= y and y2 = 2x:. Euclid 
wrote 
about 
the parabola, 
and it was given 
its present 
name 
by Apollonius. 
Pascal 
considered 
the parabola 
as a projection 
of a CIRCLE, and 
Galileo 
showed 
that 
projectiles 
falling 
under 
uniform 
gravity 
follow 
parabolic 
paths. 
Gregory 
and 
Newton 
considered 
the CATACAUSTIC properties 
of a parabola 
which 
bring 
parallel 
rays of light 
to a focus (MacTutor 
Archive). 
Parabola 
For a parabola 
opening 
to the 
right, 
the 
equation 
in 
CARTESIAN COORDINATES is 
J(x-p)2+y2 
=x-+p 
(1) 
(x - p)” -+ y2 = (x + p)” 
(2) 
X2 
-2px+p2+y2=x2+2pxtp2 
(3) 
y2 = 4px* 
(4) 
If the VERTEX 
is at (x0, yo) instead 
of (0, 0), the equa- 
tion 
is 
(y - yo)2 = 4p(x - x0)* 
If the parabola 
opens 
upwards, 
(5) 
X2 
= 4PY 
(6) 
(which 
is the form 
shown 
in the above 
figure 
at left). 
The 
quantity 
4p is known 
as the LATUS RECTUM. 
In 
POLAR 
COORDINATES, 
(7) 
In PEDAL COORDINATES withthe 
PEDAL 
POINT at the 
FOCUS, the equation 
is 
p2 = ar.

In this convention, 
the traces

PARABOLAS with 
a common

The

Paracompact 
Space 
A paracompact 
space is a HAUSDORFF SPACE such that 
every open COVER has a LOCALLY FINITE open REFINE- 
MENT. 
Paracompactness 
is a very 
common 
property 
that TOPOLOGICAL SPACES satisfy. 
Paracompactness 
is 
similar 
to the compactness 
property, 
but generalized 
for 
slightly 
“bigger” 
SPACES. 
All 
MANIFOLDS 
(e.g, 
second 
countable 
and Hausdorff) 
are paracompact.

Parallel 
, 
Two lines 
in 2-dimensional 
EUCLIDEAN 
SPACE are said 
to be parallel 
if they 
do not intersect. 
In Z&dimensional 
EUCLIDEAN SPACE, parallel 
lines not only 
fail to inter- 
sect, but 
also maintain 
a constant 
separation 
between 
points 
closest 
to each other 
on the two lines. 
(Lines 
in 
3-space 
which 
are not parallel 
but 
do not intersect 
are 
called 
SKEW 
LINES.) 
In a NON-EUCLIDEAN 
GEOMETRY, the concept 
ofpar- 
allelism 
must 
be modified 
from 
its intuitive 
meaning. 
This 
is accomplished 
by changing 
the so-called 
PARAL- 
LEL POSTULATE. 
While

Parallel 
Postulate 
Given 
any straight 
line and a point 
not on it, there 
“ex- 
ists one and only one straight 
line which passes” through 
that 
point 
and never intersects 
the first 
line, 
no matter 
how far they are extended. 
This 
statement 
is equivalent 
to the fifth of EUCLID'S POSTULATES, which Euclid 
him- 
self avoided 
using 
until 
proposition 
29 in the Elements. 
For centuries, 
many 
mathematicians 
believed 
that 
this 
statement 
was not a true postulate, 
but rather 
a theorem 
which 
could 
be derived 
from 
the first 
four of EUCLID'S 
POSTULATES. (That 
part 
of geometry 
which 
could 
be 
derived 
using 
only 
postulates 
1-4 came 
to be known 
as 
ABSOLUTE 
GEOMETRY.) 
Over 
the years, 
many 
purported 
proofs 
of the parallel 
postulate 
were published. 
However, 
none were correct, 
including 
the 28 “proofs” 
G. S. Kliigel 
analyzed 
in his 
dissertation 
of 1763 (Hofstadter 
1989). 
In 
1823, Janos 
Bolyai 
and Lobachevsky 
independently 
realized 
that 
en- 
t irely 
self-consistent 
“NON-EUCLIDEAN 
GEOMETRIES" 
could 
be created 
in which 
the parallel 
postulate 
did not 
hold. 
(Gauss 
had 
also discovered 
but 
suppressed 
the 
existence 
of non-Euclidean 
geometries.) 
As stated 
above, 
the 
parallel 
postulate 
describes 
the 
type 
of geometry 
now known 
as PARABOLIC GEOME- 
TRY. If, however, 
the phrase 
“exists 
one and only 
one 
straight 
line 
which 
passes” 
is replace 
by “exist 
no line 
which 
passes,” 
or ‘&exist at least 
two lines 
which 
pass,” 
the postulate 
describes 
equally 
valid 
(though 
less intu- 
itive) 
types 
of geometries 
known 
as ELLIPTIC and 
HY- 
PERBOLIC GEOMETRIES, respectively.

it is possible

In general, 
partial 
differential 
equations 
are much 
more 
difficult 
to solve 
analytically 
than 
are ORDINARY 
DIF- 
FERENTIAL 
EQUATIONS. 
They 
may sometimes

or-when 
all 
else 
fails (which 
it frequently 
does)-numerical 
methods. 
Fortunately, 
partial 
differential 
equations 
of second- 
order 
are often 
amenable 
to analytical 
solution. 
Such 
PDEs 
are of the form 
Auez + ZBu,, 
-I- GIL,, 
+ Du, 
+ Eu, 
-I- F = 0.

as ELLIPTIC, 
HYPERBOLIC, 
or PARABOLIC. 
If Z is a POSITIVE 
DEFINITE 
MATRIX, 
i.e., det(Z) 
> 0, 
the PDE 
is said to be ELLIPTIC. 
LAPLACE’S 
EQUATION 
and POISSON’S 
EQUATION 
are examples. 
Boundary 
con- 
ditions 
are used to give the constraint 
u(x, y) = g(x, y) 
on do, 
where 
uxx -+ uyy = f (‘llX,UY, 
u, 5, Y) 
(4) 
holds 
in 0. 
If det(Z) 
< 0, the PDE 
is said to be HYPERBOLIC. 
The 
WAVE 
EQUATION 
is an example 
of a hyperbolic 
par- 
tial 
differential 
equation. 
Initial-boundary 
conditions 
are used to give 
~(2, y, t) = g(x, y, t) 
for x f do, t > 0

u(x, y, 0) = 210(x, y)

(7) 
where 
uxy = f(Ux,W,X,Y) 
(8)

in s2. 
If det(Z) 
= 0, the 
PDE 
is said to be parabolic. 
The 
HEAT

equation 
and other 
dif- 
fusion

Partially

Set 
In a normal 
n x n LATIN 
SQUARE, 
the entries 
in each row 
and column 
are chosen 
from 
a “global” 
set of n objects. 
Like 
a Latin 
square, 
a partial 
Latin 
square 
has no two 
rows or columns 
which 
contain 
the same 
two symbols. 
However, 
in a partial 
Latin 
square, 
each cell is assigned 
one of its own set of n 
possible 
“local” 
(and 
distinct) 
symbols, 
chosen 
from 
an overall 
set of more 
than 
three 
distinct 
symbols, 
and these 
symbols 
may 
vary from 
lo- 
cation 
to location. 
For example, 
given 
the possible 
sym- 
bols 
(1, 2, . . . , 6) which 
must 
be arranged

A partially 
ordered 
set (or POSET) is a SET taken 
to- 
gether 
with 
a PARTIAL 
ORDER 
on it. 
Formally, 
a par- 
tially 
ordered 
set is defined 
as an ordered 
pair 
P 
= 
(X, I), 
where 
X is called 
the 
GROUND 
SET of P and 
5 is the PARTIAL ORDER 
of P.

A RELATION “<” 
is a partial 
order 
on a SET S if it has: 
- 
1. Reflexivity: 
a 5 a for all a f S. 
2. Antisymmetry: 
a < b and b < a implies 
a = b.

a < c.

For a partial

the size of the longest

is called 
the LENGTH (WIDTH).

a POSET.

When 
explicitly 
listing 
the 
partitions 
of a number 
n, 
the simplest 
form 
is the so-called 
natural 
representation 
which 
simply 
gives the sequence 
of numbers 
in the rep- 
resentation 
(e.g., (2, 1, 1) for the number 
4 = 2 + l+ 
1). 
The 
multiplicity 
representation 
instead 
gives the number 
of times 
each number 
occurs together 
with that 
number 
(e-g.7 (2, 11, (1, 2) for 4 = 2 m 1 + 1 l 2). 
The 
FERRERS 
DIAGRAM 
is a pictorial 
representation 
of a partition. 
Euler 
invented 
a GENERATING 
FUNCTION 
which 
gives 
rise to a POWER 
SERIES

Some

are: 
1. 
2. 
3.

5. 
The number 
of partitions 
of n in which no EVEN part 
is repeated 
is the same as the number 
of partitions 
of 
n in which 
no part occurs 
more 
than 
three times 
and 
also the same 
as the number 
of partitions 
in which 
no part 
is divisible 
by four. 
The 
number 
of partitions 
of n in which 
no part 
oc- 
curs more 
often than 
d times 
is the same as the num- 
ber of partitions 
in which 
no term 
is a multiple 
of 
d+1. 
The number 
of partitions 
of n in which 
each part ap- 
pears either 
2, 3, or 5 times 
is the same as the number 
of partitions 
in which 
each part 
is CONGRUENT mod 
12 to either 
2, 3, 6, 9, or 10. 
The 
number 
of partitions 
of n in which 
no part 
ap- 
pears exactly 
once is the same as the number 
of par- 
titions 
of n in which 
no part 
is CONGRUENT to 1 or 
5 mod 
6. 
The 
number 
of partitions 
in which 
the parts 
are all 
EVEN and 
different 
is equal 
to the absolute 
differ- 
ence of the number 
of partitions 
with ODD and EVEN 
parts. 
P(n,k), 
also written 
Pk(n), 
is the number 
of ways of 
writing 
n as a sum 
of k terms, 
and 
can be computed 
from 
the RECURRENCE RELATION 
P(n, 
k) = P(n 
- 1, k - 1) + P(n 
- k, k) 
(29) 
(Ruskey). 
The 
number 
of partitions 
of n with 
largest 
part 
k is the same as P(n, 
k).

It states 
that,

HEXAGON inscribed 
in 
a CYNIC SECTION, the 
three 
pairs 
of the continuations

called 
the PASCAL LINE.

possible 
ways of taking 
all VERTICES in any order, 
but 
among 
these are six equivalent 
CYCLIC PERMUTATIONS 
and two possible 
orderings, 
so the total

(not 
all simple) 
is

There

a total

intersect

turns 
out to always be possible

k = 2 in this case, 
to obtain 
P2r2 - Dq2T2 
= 1, 
(7) 
so the solution 
in smallest 
INTEGERS 
is zc = pzr, 
y = qzr. 
Summarizing, 
Given 
one solution 
(x, y) = (p, CJ) (which 
can be found 
as above), 
a whole 
family 
of solutions 
taking 
each side to the nth 
POWER, 
can be found 
by 
x2 - Dy2 
= (p” - Dq2)n 
= 1. 
(9) 
Factoring 
gives 
(x+Joy)(x-JDY) 
= (P+JDq)n(P--JDQ)n 
(10) 
X2 
-Dy2=4

and calls 
it the 
FERMAT

SQUARE

Now define 
“deflation”

The

takes 
an acute

to the union 
of two ACUTE

one 
OBTUSE, 
and 
the 
OBTUSE 
TRIANGLE 
goes 
to an 
ACUTE

TRIANGLE. 
These 
operations 
are illustrated 
below. 
When 
applied 
to a collection 
of tiles, 
the deflation 
op- 
erator 
leads to a more 
refined 
collection. 
The 
operators 
do not respect

boundaries, 
but 
do respect

Pentaflake 
\ \ \ \ / 
/ 
h 
A FRACTAL 
with 
5-fold 
symmetry. 
As illustrated 
above, 
five PENTAGONS 
can be arranged 
around 
an identical 
PENTAGON 
to form 
the first iteration 
of the pentaflake. 
This 
cluster 
of six pentagons 
has the shape of a pentagon 
with 
five triangular 
wedges removed. 
This 
construction 
was first noticed 
by Albrecht 
Diirer 
(Dixon 
1991). 
For a pentagon 
of side length 
1, the first 
ring 
of pen- 
tagons 
has centers 
at RADIUS 
dl = 2r = $(l+ 
&)R 
= #R, 
(1) 
Peniaffake 
where 
qb is the 
GOLDEN 
RATIO. 
The 
INRADIUS 
T and 
CIRCUMRADIUS 
R are related 
by 
r = Rcos(;r) 
= a(&+ 
l)R, 
and these are related 
to the side length 
s by 
s = 22/R2_rz 
= ~R~iciz. 
The 
height 
h is 
h = ssin@) 
= as da=;v%R, 
giving 
a RADIUS 
of the second 
ring 
as 
d2 = 2(R+ 
h) = (2 -j- &)R 
= 4”R. 
Continuing, 
the nth 
pentagon 
ring 
is located 
at 
d, = q$2n-1. 
(2) 
(3) 
(4) 
(5) 
(6) 
Now, 
the length 
of the side of the first 
pentagon 
com- 
pound 
is given 
by 
s2 = 2J(2~ 
+ R)2 - (h + R)2 = R&-%, 
(7) 
so the ratio 
of side lengths 
of the original 
pentagon 
to 
that 
of the compound 
is 
s2 
Rd5 
+ 2& 
-- 
- 
=1++* 
s 
+RJ- 
(8) 
We can now calculate 
the dimension 
of the pentafiake 
fractal. 
Let 
Nn be the number 
of black 
pentagons 
and 
L, 
the length 
of side of a pentagon 
after the n iteration, 
Nn = 6”

Ln = (l+

Five pentagons 
can be arranged 
around 
an identical 
pen- 
tagon 
to form 
the first iteration 
of the “PENTAFLAKE," 
which 
itself has the shape 
of a pentagon 
with 
five trian- 
gular 
wedges removed. 
For a pentagon 
of side length 
1, 
the first 
ring 
of pentagons 
has centers 
at radius 
4, the 
second ring 
at @3, and the nth 
at 42n-1. 
* 
In proposition 
IV.11, 
Euclid 
showed 
how to inscribe 
a 
regular 
pentagon 
in a CIRCLE. 
Ptolemy 
also 
gave a 
RULER and COMPASS construction 
for the pentagon 
in 
his epoch-making 
work 
The Almagest. 
While 
Ptolemy’s 
construction 
has a SIMPLICXTY of 16, a GEOMETRIC 
CONSTRUCTION using 
CARLYLE CIRCLES can be made 
with GEOMETROGRAPHY symbol 
2S1 + S2 + 8C1 + OC2 + 
4C3, which 
has SIMPLICITY 15 (De Temple 
1991). 
PO 
Pentagon 
The 
following 
elegant 
construction 
for the pentagon 
is 
due to Richmond 
(1893). 
Given 
a point, 
a CIRCLE may 
be constructed 
of any 
desired 
RADIUS, and 
a DIAM- 
ETER drawn 
through 
the 
center. 
Call 
the 
center 
0, 
and 
the right 
end of the DIAMETER PO. The 
DIAME- 
TER~ERPENDICULAR 
totheoriginal 
DIAMETER maybe 
constructed 
by finding 
the PERPENDICULAR BISECTOR. 
Call 
the upper 
endpoint 
of this PERPENDICULAR DIAM- 
ETER B. 
For the pentagon, 
find 
the MIDPOINT 
of OB 
and call it D. 
Draw 
DPo, 
and BISECT LOD&, 
calling 
the intersection 
point 
with 
OpO Nl. 
Draw N#l 
PAR- 
ALLEL to OB, 
and the first 
two points 
of the pentagon 
are PO and pl 
(Coxeter 
1969). 
Madachy 
(1979) 
illustrates 
how to construct 
a pentagon 
by folding 
and knotting 
a strip 
of paper.

Percent 
The use of percentages 
is a way of eipressing 
RATIOS in 
terms 
of whole 
numbers. 
Given 
a RATIO or FRACTION, 
it is converted 
to a percentage 
by multiplying 
by 100 
and 
appending 
a “percentage 
sign” 
%. 
For example, 
if an investment 
grows 
from 
a number 
P 
= 
13.00 
to 
a number 
A = 22.50, 
then 
A is 22.50/13.00 
= 1.7308 
times 
as much 
as P, 
or 173.08%, 
and 
the 
investment 
has grown 
by 73.08%.

Perfect 
Number 
Perfect 
numbers 
are INTEGERS n such that 
n = S(n), 
(1) 
where s(n) 
is the RESTRICTED DIVISOR FUNCTION (i.e., 
the SUM of PROPER 
DIVISORS 
of n), or equivalently 
u(n) 
= 273, 
(2) 
where 
a(n) 
is the 
DIVISOR 
FUNCTION 
(i.e., the SUM of 
DIVISORS 
of n including 
n itself). 
The 
first few perfect 
numbers 
are 6, 28, 496, 
8128, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
A000396). 
This 
follows 
from 
the fact that 
6=>;1,2,3 
28 = >) 
1,2,4,7,14 
496 = x 
1,2,4,8,16,31,62,124,248, 
etc. 
Perfect 
numbers 
are intimately 
connected 
with 
a class 
of numbers 
known 
as MERSENNE PRIMES. This 
can be 
demonstrated 
by considering 
a perfect 
number 
P of the 
form 
P = ~2~~~ where q is PRIME. Then 
u(P) 
= 2P, 
(3) 
and using 
4l) 
= Q + 1 
(4) 
for Q prime, 
and 
u(F) 
= 2”+l 
- 1 
(5) 
gives 
a(q2P-I) 
= a(q)a(2P-1) 
= (q-l- 
1)(2p - 1) 
= 2q2 P--l 
= 
@P 
(6) 
4(2p - 1) + 2p - 1 = q2p 
(7) 
Q = 2p - 1. 
(8) 
Therefore, 
if iWp = q = 2p - 1 is PRIME, then 
P = +(M, 
+ l)Mp 
= 2’-72’-

is a perfect 
number,

in Proposition 
IX.36

Perfect 
Number 
All EVEN 
perfect 
numbers 
are of this form, 
as was proved 
by Euler 
in a posthumous 
paper. 
The 
only even perfect 
number 
of the form 
x3 + 1 is 28 (Mgkowski 
1962). 
It is not known 
if any 
ODD 
perfect 
numbers 
exist, 
al- 
though 
numbers 
up to 10300 have been checked 
(Brent 
et al. 
1991, 
Guy 
1994) 
without 
success, improving 
the 
result 
of Tuckerman 
(1973), 
who checked 
odd numbers 
up to 103? 
Euler 
showed 
that 
an ODD perfect 
number, 
if it exists, 
must 
be of the form 
m = p4a+‘Q2, 
(10) 
where 
p is an ODD 
PRIME 
RELATIVELY 
PRIME 
to Q, 
In 1887, Sylvester 
conjectured 
and in 1925, Gradshtein 
proved 
that 
any ODD perfect 
number 
must 
have at least 
six different 
prime 
aliquot 
factors 
(or eight 
if it is not 
divisible 
by 3; Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987). 
Catalan 
(1888) 
proved 
that 
if an ODD 
perfect 
number 
is not 
divisible 
by 3, 5, or 7, it has at least 
26 distinct 
prime 
aliquot 
factors. 
Stuyvaert 
(1896) 
proved 
that 
an ODD perfect 
number 
must 
be a sum 
of squares. 
All 
EVEN 
perfect 
numbers 
end in 16, 28, 36, 56, or 76 (Lucas 
1891) 
and, 
with 
the exception 
of 6, have DIGITAL 
ROOT 
1. 
Every 
perfect 
number 
of the form 
2p(2p’1 
- 1) can be 
written 
P/2 
2y2pfl 
- 1) = E(2k 
- 1)3. 
(11) 
k=l 
All 
perfect 
numbers 
are 
HEXAGONAL 
NUMBERS 
and 
therefore 
TRIANGULAR 
NUMBERS. 
It therefore 
follows 
that 
perfect 
numbers 
are always 
the sum of consecutive 
POSITIVE 
integers 
starting 
at 1, for example, 
6=2 
n 
(12) 
n=l 
28 = 9; 
n 
(13) 
n=l 
496=? 
n 
(14) 
n=l 
(Singh 
1997). 
All 
EVEN 
perfect 
numbers 
P > 6 are of 
the form 
P+l+gT,, 
(15) 
where Tn. is a TRIANGULAR 
NUMBER 
such that 
n = Sj + 2 (Eaton 
1995, 
1996). 
The 
sum 
of 
reciprocals 
of all the divisors 
of a perfect 
number 
is 2,

If

And if

A type of RULER 
considered

which 
has Fc 
distinct 
marks 
spaced 
such that 
the distances 
between 
marks 
can be used to measure 
all the distances 
1, 2, 3, 4, 
up to some maximum 
distance 
n > Ic. Such a ruler 
cah be constructed 
from 
a PERFECT DIFFERENCE SET 
by subtracting 
one from 
each element. 
For example, 
the 
PERFECT DIFFERENCE 
SET 
(1, 
2, 5, 7) gives 0, 1, 4, 
6, which 
can be used to measure 
1 - 0 = 1, 6 - 4 = 2, 
4 - 1 = 3, 4 - 0 = 4, 6 - 
1 = 5, 6 - 0 = 6 (so we get 6 
distances 
with 
only 
four marks).

A SQUARE which 
can be DISSECTED into 
a number 
of 
smaller 
SQUARES 
with 
no two equal 
is called 
a PERFECT 
SQUARE DISSECTION (or a SQUARED SQUARE). Square 
dissections 
in which 
the 
squares 
need 
not 
be different 
sizes are called 
MRS. PERKINS' QUILTS. 
If no subset 
of the SQUARES forms 
a RECTANGLE, then 
the perfect 
square 
is called 
“simple.” 
Lusin 
claimed 
that 
perfect 
squares 
were impossible 
to construct, 
but this assertion 
was proved 
erroneous 
when a %-SQUARE 
perfect 
square 
was published 
by R. Sprague 
in 1939 (Wells 
1991). 
There 
is a unique 
simple 
perfect 
square 
of order 
21 
(the 
lowest 
possible 
order), 
discovered

A. J. W. Duijvestijn 
(Bouwkamp

1992). 
It is composed 
of 21 squares 
with 
total 
side length 
112, 
and 
is illustrated 
above. 
There 
is a simple 
notation 
(sometimes 
called 
Bouwkamp 
code) 
used 
to describe 
perfect 
squares. 
In this 
notation, 
brackets 
are used to 
group 
adjacent 
squares 
with 
flush 
tops, 
and 
then 
the 
groups 
are sequentially 
placed 
in the highest 
(and 
left- 
most) 
possible 
slots. 
For example, 
the 21-square 
illus- 
trated 
above 
is denoted 
[50, 35, 271, [8, 191, [15, 17, 111, 
[6, 241, [29, 25, 9, 21, [7, 1% 
[16], 14% [4, 371, [=I. 
The

of order 
n for

Duijvestijn’s

Permil 
The use of percentages 
is a way of expressing 
RATIOS 
in 
terms 
of whole 
numbers. 
Given 
a RATIO 
or FRACTION, 
it is converted 
to a permil-age 
by multiplying 
by 1000 
and 
appending 
a “mil 
sign” 
o/00. For example, 
if an 
investment 
grows from 
a number 
P = 13.00 to a number 
A = 
22.50, 
then 
A is 22.50/13.00 
= 
1.7308 
times 
as 
much 
as P, or 1730.8 %o.

The 
rearrangement 
of elements

A representation

An

cor- 
responding 
to the permutations 
(1 -+ 3, 3 +

combine 
to give (4, 2, 1, 3).

Permutations

Permutation 
Symbol 
A three-index 
object 
sometimes 
called 
the LEVI-CIVITA 
SYMBOL 
defined 
by 
0 
for i = j,j 
= k, or k = i 
Eijk = 
-t-l 
for (a, 
k> E {(1,2,3), 
(2,3, l), (3,1,2>} 
-1 
for (u, 
k> E {(l, 
3,2), 
(3,2,1>, 
(2,1,3)}.

The permutation 
symbol 
satisfies 
6ijEijk 
= 
0 
(2) 
Permutation 
Group 
A finite 
GROUP 
of substitutions 
of elements 
for each 
other. 
For instance, 
the order 
4 permutation 
group 
(4, 
2, 1, 3) would 
rearrange 
the elements 
{A, 
B, C, D} 
in 
the order 
{D, 
B, 
A, C}. 
A SUBSTITUTION 
GROUP 
of 
two elements 
is called 
a TRANSPOSITION. 
Every 
SUB- 
STITUTION 
GROUP 
with 
> 2 elements 
can be written 
as 
a product 
of transpositions. 
For example, 
(abc) = (ab)(ac) 
(abcde) 
= (ab)(ac)(ad)(ae). 
CONJUGACY 
CLASSES 
of elements 
which 
are 
inter- 
changed 
are called 
CYCLES 
(in the above 
example, 
the 
CYCLES are ((1, 
3, 4}, (2))).

where &j is the KRONECKER

The symbol 
can be 
defined 
as the SCALAR 
TRIPLE 
PRODUCT 
of unit 
vectors 
in a right-handed 
coordinate 
system,

cijk 
= xi ’ (kj

The 
symbol 
can also be interpreted 
as a TENSOR, 
in 
which 
case it is called 
the PERMUTATION 
TENSOR.

elucidated 
by the 
Florentine 
architect 
F. Brunelleschi 
(1377-1446). 
These 
rules 
are summarized 
by

(1991): 
1. The horizon 
appears 
as a line. 
2. Straight 
image. 
lines 
space appear 
as straight 
in the 
3. Sets of PARALLEL 
lines meet 
at a VANISHING 
POINT. 
4. Lines 
PARALLEL 
to the picture 
plane 
appear 
PARA

have no VANISHIN 
G POINT.

There 
is a graphical 
method

Phyllotaxis 
The 
beautiful 
arrangement 
of leaves 
in 
some 
plants, 
called 
phyllotaxis, 
obeys a number 
of subtle 
mathemat- 
ical relationships. 
For instance, 
the florets 
in the head 
of a sunflower 
form 
two oppositely 
directed 
spirals: 
55 
of them 
clockwise 
and 
34 counterclockwise. 
Surpris- 
ingly, 
these numbers 
are consecutive 
FIBONACCI 
NUM- 
BERS. The ratios 
of alternate 
FIBONACCI 
NUMBERS 
are 
given by the convergents 
to #-2, where $ is the GOLDEN 
RATIO, and are said to measure 
the fraction 
of a turn 
between 
successive 
leaves on the stalk 
of a plant: 
l/2 
for elm 
and 
linden, 
l/3 
for beech 
and 
hazel, 
2/5 
for 
oak and apple, 
3/8 for poplar 
and rose, 5/13 
for willow 
and almond, 
etc. (Coxeter 
1969, Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987). 
A similar 
phenomenon 
occurs 
for DAISIES, pineapples, 
pinecones, 
cauliflowers, 
and so on. 
Lilies, 
irises, 
and 
the 
trillium 
have 
three 
petals; 
col- 
umbines, 
buttercups, 
larkspur, 
and wild 
rose have five 
petals; 
delphiniums, 
bloodroot, 
and 
cosmos 
have eight 
petals; 
corn 
marigolds 
have 
13 petals; 
asters 
have

(Gosper,

According 
to 
Gosper,

carries 
only 
slightly

7r crops 
up in all sorts of unexpected 
places 
in mathe- 
matics 
besides 
CIRCLES 
and 
SPHERES. 
For example, 
it 
occurs 
in the normalization 
of the 
GAUSSIAN 
DISTRI- 
BUTION, 
in the distribution 
of PRIMES, 
in the construc- 
tion 
of numbers 
which 
are very close to INTEGERS 
(the 
RAMANWJAN 
CONSTANT), 
and 
in the probability 
that 
a pin dropped 
on a set of PARALLEL 
lines 
intersects 
a 
line 
(BUFFON’S 
NEEDLE 
PROBLEM). 
Pi also appears 
as 
the average 
ratio 
of the actual 
length 
and the direct 
dis- 
tance 
between 
source 
and mouth 
in a meandering 
river 
(St@llum 
1996, Singh 
1997). 
A brief 
history 
of NOTATION 
for pi is given 
by Castel- 
lanos 
(1988). 
7r is sometimes 
known 
as LUDOLPH’S 
CON- 
STANT after 
Ludolph 
van Ceulen 
(1539-1610), 
a Dutch 
7r calculator. 
The 
symbol 
*TT was first 
used by William 
Jones 
in 1706, 
and subsequently 
adopted 
by Euler. 
In 
Measurement 
of a Circle, 
Archimedes 
(ca. 225 BC) 
ob- 
tained 
the first 
rigorous 
approximation

using 
the 
ARCHIMEDES 
ALGORITHM. 
Using 
n = 
4 (a 96-gon), 
Archimedes 
obtained 
3+g 
<n<3++ 
(6) 
(Shanks 
1993, p. 140). 
The 
Bible 
contains 
two references 
(I Kings 
7:23 
and 
Chronicles 
4:2) which 
give a value 
of 3 for n. It should 
be mentioned, 
however, 
that 
both 
instances 
refer 
to 
a value 
obtained 
from 
physical 
measurements 
and, 
as 
such, 
are probably 
well within 
the 
bounds 
of experi- 
mental 
uncertainty. 
I Kings 
7:23 states, 
“Also 
he made 
a molten 
sea of ten 
Cubits 
from 
brim 
to brim, 
round 
in compass, 
and five cubits 
in height 
thereof; 
and a line 
thirty 
cubits 
did compass 
it round 
about.” 
This 
implies 
T = C/d 
= 30/10 
= 3. The 
Babylonians 
gave an esti- 
mate 
of 7r as 3 + l/8 
= 3.125. 
The 
Egyptians 
did better 
still, 
obtaining 
28/34 
= 3.1605.. 
. in the Rhind 
papyrus, 
and 
22/7 
elsewhere. 
The 
Chinese 
geometers, 
however, 
did best of all, rigorously 
deriving 
r to 6 decimal 
places. 
A method 
similar 
to Archimedes’ 
can be used to esti- 
mate 
x by starting 
with 
an n-gon 
and then 
relating 
the 
AREA 
of subsequent 
2n-gons. 
Let p be the ANGLE

of one of the POLYGON'S 
segments,

Vikte 
(1593) 
was the first 
to give an exact 
expression 
for 7r by taking 
n = 4 in the 
above 
expression,

However,

n is known 
to be IRRATIONAL 
(Lambert 
1761, Legendre 
1794) 
and even TRANSCENDENTAL 
(Lindemann 
1882). 
Incidentally, 
Lindemann’s 
proof 
of the 
transcendence 
of 7r also proved 
that 
the GEOMETRIC PROBLEM OF 
ANTIQUITY 
known 
as CIRCLE SQUARING is impossible. 
A simplified, 
but 
still 
difficult, 
version 
of Lindemann’s 
proof 
is given 
by Klein 
(1955). 
It 
is also known 
that 
r is not 
a LIOUVILLE NUMBER 
(Mahler 
1953). 
In 1974, M. Mignotte 
showed that 
(20) 
has only 
a finite 
number 
of solutions 
in INTEGERS (Le 
Lionnais 
1983, 
p. 50). 
This 
result 
was subsequently 
improved 
by Chudnovsky 
and Chudnovsky 
(1984) 
who 
showed that 
(21) 
although 
it is likely 
that 
the exponent 
can be reduced 
to 
2 + e, where E is an infinitesimally 
small 
number 
(Bor- 
wein et al. 1989). 
It is not known 
if 7~ is NORMAL (Wagon 
1985), 
although 
the first 30 million 
DIGITS are very UNT- 
FORMLY DISTRIBUTED 
(Bailey 
1988): 
The following 
dis- 
tribution 
is found 
for the first 12 DIGITS of 7r--3. It shows 
no statistically 
SIGNIFICANT departure 
from a UNIFORM 
DISTRIBUTION 
(technically, 
in the CHI-SQUARED TEST, 
it has a value 
of xS2 = 5.60 for the first 5 x lOlo 
terms).

giving 
24 digits 
in all (3.14159265358979323846264). 
An even more 
extensive 
rhyming 
mnemonic 
giving 
31 
digits 
is “Now 
I will 
a rhyme 
construct, 
By 
chosen 
words 
the young 
instruct. 
Cunningly 
devised 
endeav- 
our, 
Con it and remember 
ever. 
Widths 
in circle 
here 
you see, Sketched 
out in strange 
obscurity.” 
(Note 
that 
the British 
spelling 
of “endeavour” 
is required 
here.) 
The following 
stanzas are the first part of a poem 
written 
by M. Keith 
based 
on Edgar 
Allen 
Poe’s 
“The 
Raven.” 
The 
entire 
poem 
gives 
740 digits; 
the 
fragment 
below 
gives 
only 
the first 
80 (Blatner 
1997, 
p. 113). 
Words 
with 
ten letters 
represent 
the digit 
0, and those with 
11 
or more 
digits 
are taken 
to represent 
two digits. 
Poe, E.: 
Near 
a Raven. 
Midnights 
so dreary, 
tired 
and weary. 
Silently 
pondering 
volumes 
extolling 
all by-now 
obsolete 
lore. 
During 
my rather 
long 
nap-the 
weirdest 
tap! 
. 
An ominous 
vibrating 
sound 
disturbing 
my chamber’s 
antedoor. 
‘This,’ 
I whispered 
quietly, 
‘I ignore.’ 
Perfectly, 
the intellect 
remembers: 
the ghostly 
fires, 
a 
glittering 
ember. 
Inflamed 
by lightning’s 
outbursts, 
windows 
cast penum- 
bras upon 
this 
floor. 
Sorrowful, 
as one mistreated, 
unhappy 
thoughts 
I heed- 
ed: 
That 
inimitable 
lesson 
in elegance-Lenore- 
is delighting, 
exciting. 
. . nevermore. 
An 
extensive 
collection 
of x mnemonics 
in many 
lan- 
guages 
is maintained 
by 
A. P. Hatzipolakis. 
Other 
mnemonics 
in various 
languages 
are given by Castellanos 
(1988) 
and Blatner 
(1997, 
pp. 112-118). 
In the following, 
the word 
“digit” 
refers to decimal 
digit 
after 
the decimal 
point. 
J. H. Conway 
has shown 
that 
there 
is a sequence 
of fewer than 
40 FRACTIONS Fl, I$ 
with 
the property 
that 
if you start 
with 
2n and re- 
peatedly 
multiply 
by the 
first 
of the 
Fi that 
gives an 
integral 
answer, 
then 
the next POWER of 2 to occur will 
be the 2”th 
decimal 
digit 
of n. 
The 
first 
occurrence 
of n OS appear 
at digits 
32, 307, 
601, 13390, 
17534, 
. . . . The 
sequence 
9999998 
occurs at 
decimal 
762 (which 
is sometimes 
called 
the FEYNMAN 
POINT). 
This 
is the 
largest 
value 
of any 
seven digits 
in the first 
million 
decimals. 
The 
first 
time 
the BEAST 
NUMBER 666 appears 
is decimal 
2440. 
The digits 
314159 
appear 
at least 
six times 
in the first 
10 million 
decimal 
places 
of r (Pickover 
1995). 
In the 
following, 
“digit” 
means 
digit 
of 7r - 3. 
The 
sequence 
0123456789 
oc- 
curs beginning 
at digits 
17,387,594,880, 
26,852,899,245, 
30,243,957,439, 
34,549,153,953, 
41,952,536,161, 
and 
43,289,964,000. 
The 
sequence 
9876543210 
occurs 
beginning 
at 
digits 
21,981,157,633, 
29,832,636,867, 
39,232,573,648, 
42,140,457,481, 
and 
43,065,796,214. 
The 
sequence 
27182818284 
(the 
digits 
of e) occur 
be- 
ginning 
at 
digit 
45,111,908,393. 
There 
are 
also 
in- 
teresting 
patterns 
for 
l/r. 
0123456789 
occurs 
at 
6,214,876,462, 
9876543210 
occurs 
at 
15,603,388,145 
and 
51,507,034,812, 
and 
999999999999 
occurs 
at 
12,479,021,132 
of l/r. 
Scanning 
the 
decimal 
expansion 
of 7r until 
all n-digit 
numbers 
have occurred, 
the last 
l-, 
2-, 
l . . digit 
num- 
bers appearing 
are 0, 68, 483, 6716, 
33394, 
569540, 
. . . 
(Sloane’s 
A032510). 
These 
end at digits 
32, 606, 8555, 
99849, 
1369564, 
14118312,

Picard 
Variety 
Let V be a VARIETY, 
and write 
G(V) 
for the set of di- 
visors, 
Gl (V) 
for the set of divisors 
linearly 
equivalent 
to 0, and Ga(V) 
for the 
group 
of divisors 
algebraically 
equal 
to 0. Then 
Ga(V)/Gi(V) 
is called 
the Picard 
va- 
riety. 
The 
ALBANESE VARIETY is dual 
to the 
Picard 
variety.

proved 
that

Salem

proved

The proof of this theorem 
is based on the LEMMA 
that 
for a Pisot-Vijayaraghavan

always 
exists a number 
X such that 
1 2 X < 8 and the following

Planar 
Graph 
A GRAPH is planar 
if it 
can be drawn 
in a PLANE 
without 
EDGES crossing 
(i.e., 
it has CROSSING NM- 
BER 0). 
Only 
planar 
graphs 
have 
DUALS. 
If G is pla- 
nar, 
then 
G has VERTEX DEGREE 5 5.

only 
for n < 4. The

More 
generally, 
Kuratowski 
proved 
in 1930 that 
a graph 
is planar 
IFF it 
does not contain 
within 
it any graph 
which can be CON- 
TRACTED 
to the pentagonal 
graph 
K(5) 
or the hexago- 
nal graph 
K(3,3). 
K5 can be decomposed 
into a union 
of 
two planar 
graphs, 
giving 
it a C6D~~~~7' of E(Kg) 
= 2. 
Simple 
CRITERIA for determining 
the depth 
of graphs 
are not known. 
Beineke 
and Harary 
(1964, 
1965) 
have 
shown that 
if n $4 
(mod 
S), then 
E(G) 
= LS(n + 7)] , 
The 
DEPTHS 
of the graphs 
Kn for n = 4, 10, 22, 28, 34,

The

each. 
However, 
the total

2!(n

(17) 
where 
(i) 
isa BIN~MXAL COEFFICIENT, sothedistances 
between 
points 
are subject 
to m relationships, 
where 
For n = 2 and n = 3, there 
are no relationships. 
How- 
ever, for a QUADRILATERAL 
(with 
n = 4), there 
is one 
(Weinberg 
1972). 
It is impossible 
to pick 
random 
variables 
which 
are uni- 
formly 
distributed 
in the plane 
(Eisenberg 
and Sullivan 
1996). 
In 4-Q 
it is possible 
for four planes 
to intersect 
in 
exactly 
one point. 
For every set of n points 
in the plane, 
there 
exists 
a point 
0 in the plane 
having 
the property 
such that 
every straight 
line through 
0 has at least 
l/3 
of the points 
on each side of it (Honsberger 
1985). 
Every 
RIGID 
motion 
of the plane 
is one of the following 
types 
(Singer 
1995) : 
1. ROTATION about 
a fixed point 
P. 
2. TRANSLATION in the direction 
of a line 
2. 
3. REFLECTION across a line 2. 
4. Glide-reflections 
along 
a line 
2. 
Every 
RIGID motion 
of the hyperbolic 
plane 
is one of 
the previous 
types 
or a 
5. Horocycle 
rotation.

Plane-Filling 
Function 
A SPACE-FILLING 
FUNCTION 
which 
mapsa 
1-D INTER- 
VAL into a 2-D area. 
Plane-filling 
functions 
were thought 
to be impossible 
until 
Hilbert 
discovered 
the HILBERT 
CURVE~~ 
1891. 
Plane-filling 
functions 
are often 
(imprecisely) 
defined 
to 
be the “limit” 
of an infinite 
sequence 
of specified 
curves 
which 
YW 
the 
PLANE 
without 
“HOLES," 
hence 
the 
more 
popular 
term 
PLANE-FILLING 
CURVE. 
The 
term 
“plane-filling 
function” 
is preferable 
to “PLANE-FILLING 
CURVE" 
because 
“curve” 
informally 
connotes 
“GRAPH” 
(i.e., range) 
of some continuous 
function, 
but the GRAPH 
of a plane-filling 
function 
is a solid patch 
of 2-space with 
no evidence 
of the order 
in which it was traced 
(and, 
for 
a dense set, retraced). 
Actually, 
all that 
is needed 
to 
rigorously 
define 
a plane-filling 
function 
is an arbitrar- 
ily refinable 
correspondence 
between 
contiguous 
subin- 
tervals 
of the 
domain 
and 
contiguous 
subareas 
of the 
range.

are not 
ONE-TO-ONE. 
In 
fact, because 
they 
map 
closed 
intervals 
onto 
closed 
ar- 
eas, they 
cannot 
help 
but 
overfill, 
revisiting 
at least 
twice a dense subset of the filled 
area. 
Thus, 
every point 
in the filled 
area has at least one inverse 
image.

Platonic 
Solid 
A solid with 
equivalent 
faces composedof 
congrxeg- 
ular 
convex 
POLYGONS. 
There 
are exactly 
five such 
solids: 
the 
CUBE, DODECAHEDRON, 
ICOSAHEDRON, 
OCTAHEDRON, and TETRAHEDRON, 
as was proved 
by 
Euclid 
in the last proposition 
of the Elements. 
The 
Platonic 
solids 
were known 
to the ancient 
Greeks, 
and were described 
by Plato 
in his Timaeus 
ca. 350 BC. 
In this work, 
Plato 
equated 
the TETRAHEDRON with the 
“element” 
fire, the CUBE 
with 
earth, 
the ICOSAHEDRON 
with water, 
the OCTAHEDRON with air, and the DODEC- 
AHEDRON with 
the stuff of which 
the constellations 
and 
heavens 
were made 
(Cromwell 
1997). 
The 
Platonic 
solids 
are sometimes 
also 
known 
as the 
REGULAR POLYHEDRA of COSMIC FIGURES (Cromwell 
1997), although 
the former 
term 
is sometimes 
used to re- 
fer collectively 
to both 
the Platonic 
solids 
and KEPLER- 
POINSOT SOLIDS (Coxeter 
1973). 
If P is a POLYHEDRON with 
congruent 
(convex) 
regular 
polygonal 
faces, then 
Cromwell 
(1997, 
pp. 77-78) 
shows 
that 
the following 
statements 
are equivalent. 
1. The vertices 
of P all lie on a SPHERE. 
2. All the DIHEDRAL ANGLES are equal. 
3. Allthe 
VERTEX FIGURES are REGULAR POLYGONS. 
4. All the SOLID ANGLES are equivalent. 
5. All the vertices 
are surrounded 
by the same number 
of FACES. 
Let w (sometimes 
denoted 
No) 
be the number 
of VER- 
TICES, e (or Nl) 
the number 
of EDGES, 
and f (or Nz) 
the number 
of FACES. The 
following 
table 
gives 
the 
SCHL;~FLISYMBOL,WYTHOFFSYMBOL,

The

of EDGES meeting 
at a VERTEX is 2e/v. 
The SCHL~FLI SYMBOL can be used to specify 
a Platonic

For the solid whose faces are p-gons 
(denoted 
{p}), 
with 
4 touching 
at each VERTEX, the symbol 
is {p, q}. 
Given 
p and q, the number

The

a + b, and the symbol

The symbol

as in a l 
b. The 
symbol 
can be used to denote 
a range

so an expression 
of the form 
x + y F z is interpreted 
as 
z+y-z 
or x-y+z. 
In contrast, 
the expression

Plutarch

Poggendorff

Plutarch 
Numbers 
In 
MoraEia, 
the 
Greek 
biographer 
and 
philosopher 
Plutarch 
states 
“Chrysippus 
says that 
the 
number 
of 
compound 
propositions 
that 
can be made 
from 
only ten 
simple 
propositions 
exceeds 
a million. 
(Hipparchus, 
to 
be sure, refuted 
this 
by showing 
that 
on the affirmative 
side there 
are 103,049 
compound 
statements, 
and on the 
negative 
side 310,952.)” 
These 
numbers 
are known 
as 
the Plutarch 
numbers. 
103,049 
can be interpreted 
as 
the number 
slo of BRACKETLNGS on ten letters 
(Stan- 
ley 1997), 
Habsieger 
et al. 1998). 
Similarly, 
Plutarch’s 
second number 
is given by (slo+srl)/2 
= 310,954 
(Hab- 
sieger 
et al. 1998).

Fixed 
Point 
Theorem 
For the rational 
curve 
of an unperturbed 
system 
with 
ROTATION NUMBER T/S under 
a map 
T (for which 
ev- 
ery point 
is a FIXED 
POINT 
of T”), 
only 
an even number 
of FIXED 
POINTS 
2I~s (k = 1, 2, 
l . l ) will remain 
under 
perturbation. 
These 
FIXED 
POINTS 
are alternately 
sta- 
ble (ELLIPTIC) 
and 
unstable 
(HYPERBOLIC). 
Around 
each elliptic 
fixed 
point 
there 
is a simultaneous 
appli- 
cation 
of the Poincar&Birkhoff 
fixed point 
theorem 
and 
the KAM 
THEOREM, which leads to a self-similar 
struc- 
ture on all scales. 
The 
original 
formulation 
was: 
Given 
a CONFORMAL 
ONE-TO-ONE 
transformation 
from 
an ANNULUS to it- 
self that 
advances 
points 
on the 
outer 
edge positively 
and on the inrier 
edge negatively, 
then 
there 
are at least 
two fixed points. 
It 
was conjectured 
by Poincare 
from 
a consideration 
of the three-body 
problem 
in celestial 
mechanics 
and 
proved 
by Birkhoff. 
Pomcar6 
Conjecture 
A SIMPLY 
CONNECTED 
~-MANIFOLD 
is HOMEOMOR- 
PHIC to the S-SPHERE. 
The 
generalized 
Poincare 
con- 
jecture 
is that 
a COMPACT 
TX-MANIFOLD 
is HOMOTOPY 
equivalent 
to the n-sphere 
IFF it is HOMEOMORPHIC 
to 
the Y-A-SPHERE. 
This 
reduces 
to the original 
conjecture 
for n = 3. 
The 
n = 1 case of the generalized 
conjecture 
is trivial, 
the 72 = 
2 case is classical, 
n = 3 remains 
open, 
n = 
4 was proved 
by Freedman 
(1982) 
(for which 
he was 
awarded 
the 
1986 FIELDS 
MEDAL), 
r~ = 5 by Zeeman 
(1961), 
n = 6 by Stallings 
(1962), 
and 72 2 7 by Smale 
in 
1961 (Smale 
subsequently 
extended 
this proof 
to include 
n 2 5.)

rather 
clear, 
the mathe-

used to deal with

can be surprisingly 
slippery. 
This

was encountered 
by none other

Point-Line 
Distance-Z-D 
Given 
a line 
aa: + by + c = 0 and 
a point 
(a, 
yo), in 
slope-intercept 
form, 
the equation 
of the line is 
a 
y = 
-x 
- 
f, 
(1) 
so the line has SLOPE 
--a/b. 
Points 
on the line have the 
vector 
coordinates 
[-gS] = [-g -;[j- 
Therefore, 
the VECTOR 4 
[ 1

is PARALLEL 
to the line, 
and the VECTOR

V= [I

Point-Line 
Distance-Z-D 
Therefore, 
Point Picking

is PERPENDICWLAR

NOW, 
a VECTOR 
from 
the 
point 
to the line 
is given 
by 
d = Irl _ Iv1 - (’ + bxl)l Jlsbz 
= IY1 - (a + bxl)l 
-

(5) 
This 
result 
can also be obtained 
much 
more 
simply 
by 
noting 
that 
the 
PERPENDICULAR 
distance 
is just 
co& 
times 
the 
vertical 
distance 
Iy1 - (a + &)I. 
But 
the 
SLOPE 
b is just

The

(1) 
The distance 
from 
a point 
(xl,y~) 
to the line y = a + bx 
can be computed 
using 
VECTOR 
algebra. 
Let 
L be a 
VECTOR 
in the same 
direction 
as the line 
The distance 
between 
a point 
on the line with parameter 
t and the point 
(~1, yl, ~1) is therefore 
(11) 
T2 = (Xl -x~-at)2+(y1-yo-bt)2+(zl-zo-Ct)2. 
(2) 
To minimize 
the distance, 
take 
(12) 
e2 > 
--z-- - -2u(x1 
- x0 - at) - 2b(y1 - yo - bt) 
-2c(x1 
- zo - ct) = 0 
(3) 
A given 
point 
on the line is 
x= [zy:] - p] = [,,“.I > 
(13) 
~(~l-~o)+qyl-yo)+c(a-ao)-t(a2+b2+c2) 
= 
0 
(4) 
so the point-line 
distance 
is 
r = (X’ i)C 
- x

so the minimum

by plugging

The low-level

a separate

of TOPOLOGY. Point-set 
topology, 
also 
called 
set-theoretic 
topology 
or general 
topology, 
is the study 
of the general 
abstract 
nature 
of 
continuity 
or 
“closeness” 
on SPACES. Basic 
point-set 
topological 
notions 
are ones like CONTINUITY, 
DIMEN- 
SION, COMPACTNESS, and CONNECTEDNESS. The 
IN- 
TERMEDIATE VALUE THEOREM (which 
states 
that 
if a 
path 
in the real line connects 
two numbers, 
then it passes 
over every point 
between 
the two) is a basic topological 
result. 
Others 
are that 
EUCLIDEAN n-space 
is HOMEO- 
MORPHIC to EUCLIDEAN m-space 
IFF m = n, and that 
REAL valued 
functions 
achieve 
maxima

A Poisson

is a distribut#ion 
with 
the follow- 
ing properties: 
1. The 
number 
of changes 
in nonoverlapping 
intervals 
are independent 
for all intervals. 
2. The probability 
of exactly 
one change 
in a sufficiently 
small 
interval 
h G l/n 
is P = vh z u/n, 
where 
u is 
the probability 
of one change 
and n is the number 
of 
TRIALS. 
3. The 
probability 
of two or more 
changes 
in a suffi- 
ciently 
small 
interval 
h is essentially 
0. 
The 
probability 
of k changes 
in a given 
interval

Poker 
Poker 
is a CARD 
game 
played 
with 
a normal 
deck 
of 
52 CARDS. 
Sometimes, 
additional 
cards called 
“jokers” 
are also used. 
In straight 
or draw poker, 
each player 
is 
normally 
dealt 
a hand 
of five cards. 
Depending 
on the 
variant, 
players 
then 
discard 
and redraw 
CARDS, 
trying 
to improve 
their 
hands. 
Bets are placed 
at each discard 
step. 
The number 
of possible 
distinct 
five-card 
hands 
is 
N- 
52 
o 5 
= 2,598,960, 
where 
0 L 
is a BINOMIAL 
COEFFICIENT. 
There 
are special 
names 
for specific 
types 
of hands. 
A 
royal 
flush 
is an ace, king, 
queen, 
jack, 
and 
10, all of 
one suit. 
A straight 
flush 
is five consecutive 
cards all of 
the same suit 
(but 
not a royal 
flush), 
where an ace may 
count 
as either 
high 
or low. 
A full house 
is three-of-a- 
kind 
and a pair. 
A flush 
is five cards of the same suit 
(but 
not 
a royal 
flush 
or straight 
flush). 
A straight 
is 
five consecutive 
cards 
(but 
not a royal 
flush or straight 
flush), 
where 
an ace may 
again 
count 
as either 
high 
or 
low. 
The probabilities 
of being 
dealt 
five-card 
poker 
hands 
of 
a given 
type 
(before 
discarding 
and with 
no jokers) 
on 
the initial 
deal are given 
below 
(Packel 
1981). As usual, 
for a hand 
with 
probability 
P, the ODDS against 
being 
dealt 
it are (l/r)

A TRIANGLE is self-conjugate 
with 
respect 
to its polar 
circle. Also, 
the RADICAL AXIS of any two polar 
circles 
is the ALTITUDE 
from 
the third 
VERTEX. 
Any two po- 
lar circles of an ORTHOCENTRIC SYSTEM are orthogonal. 
The polar 
circles 
of the triangles 
of a COMPLETE QUAD- 
RILATERAL constitute 
a COAXAL SYSTEM conjugate 
to 
that 
of the circles 
on the diagonals. 
A polar 
curve is symmetric

0 by -8 in its equation 
produces 
an equivalent

symmetric 
about

ALGORITHM 
which 
can be 
implemented 
in a single-step 
or double-step 
form. 
In 
the single-step 
version, 
PRIMES 
p are found 
if p - 1 is a 
product 
of small 
PRIMES 
by finding 
an ~rz such that 
m E cq (mod 
n) , 
where 
p - l/q, 
with 
q a large 
number 
and 
(c,n) 
= 1. 
Then 
since p - llq, 
TTC E 1 (mod 
p), so plm - 1. There 
is therefore 
a good 
chance 
that 
n{nz - 1, in which 
case 
GCD(m- 
1,n) 
(where GCD 
is the GREATEST 
COMMON 
DIVISOR) 
will 
be a nontrivial 
divisor 
of n. 
In the double-step 
version, 
a PRIMES 
p can be factored 
if p - 1 is a product 
of small 
PRIMES 
and a single 
larger 
PRIME.

Conjecture 
Let n be a POSITIVE 
INTEGER 
and 
r(n) 
the number 
of 
(not 
necessarily 
distinct) 
PRIME 
FACTORS 
of n (with 
~(1) 
= 0). Let 0(m) 
be the number 
of POSITIVE 
INTE- 
GERS 5 m with 
an ODD 
number 
of PRIME 
factors, 
and 
E(m) 
the number 
of POSITIVE 
INTEGERS 
5 m with 
an 
EVEN 
number 
of PRIME 
factors. 
Pblya 
conjectured 
that 
L(m) 
= E(m) 
- 0(m) 
= F 
A(n) 
n=l 
is 5 0, where A(n) 
is the LIOUVILLE 
FUNCTION. 
The 
conjecture 
was made 
in 
1919, 
and 
disproven 
by 
FIaselgrove 
(1958) 
using 
a method 
due to Ingham 
(1942). 
Lehman 
(1960) 
f ound 
the first 
explicit 
counterexample, 
L(906,180,359) 
= 
1, and 
the smallest 
counterexample 
m = 906,150,257 
was found 
by Tanaka 
(1980). 
The first 
n for which 
L(n) 
= 0 are n = 2, 4, 6, 10, 16, 26, 40, 96, 
586,906150256, 
. . . (Tanaka 
1980, Sloane’s 
A028488). 
It 
is unknown 
if L(x) 
changes 
sign infinitely 
often 
(Tanaka 
1980).

Theorem 
A very general 
theorem 
which 
allows the number 
of dis- 
crete 
combinatorial 
objects 
of a given 
type 
to be enu- 
merated 
(counted) 
as a function 
of their 
“order.” 
The 
most 
common 
application 
is in the counting 
of the num- 
ber of GRAPHS 
of n nodes, 
TREES 
and ROOTED 
TREES 
with 
72 branches, 
GROUPS 
of order 
n, etc. The 
theorem 
is an extension 
of BURNSIDE'S 
LEMMA 
and is sometimes 
also called 
the P~LYA-BURNSIDE 
LEMMA.

Polygon 
A closed 
plane figure 
with n sides. 
If all sides and angles 
are equivalent, 
the polygon 
is called 
regular. 
Regular 
polygons 
can be CONVEX or STAR. The 
word 
derives 
from 
the Greek 
poly (many) 
and gonu 
(knee).

The

of a polygon 
is defined 
to be POSITIVE 
if 
the points 
are arranged 
in a counterclockwise 
order, 
and 
NEGATIVE 
if they are in clockwise 
order 
(Beyer

COMPASS and 
STRAIGHTEDGE 
constructions 
dating 
back 
to Euclid 
were capable 
of inscribing 
regular 
poly- 
gons of 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, . . . , 
sides. 
However, 
this 
listing 
is not a complete 
enumera- 
tion of “constructible” 
polygons. 
In fact, a regular 
n-gon 
is constructible 
only 
if 4(n) is a POWER of 2, where 
4 
is the TOTIENT 
FUNCTION 
(this 
is a NECESSARY but 
not SUFFICIENT condition). 
More 
specifically, 
a regular 
n-gon 
(n 2 3) can be constructed 
by STRAIGHTEDGE 
and COMPASS (Le., can have trigonometric 
functions 
of 
its ANGLES expressed 
in terms 
of finite 
SQUARE ROOT 
extractions)

FER- 
- 
MAT PRIMES. 
FERMAT NUMBERS are ofthe 
form 
Fm = 22m +I, 
(20) 
where VJ is an INTEGER 2 0. The 
only 
known 
PRIMES 
of this form 
are 3, 5, 17, 257, and 65537. 
The 
fact that 
this 
condition 
was SUFFICIENT was first 
proved 
by Gauss in 1796 when he was 19 years old, and 
it relies 
on the property 
of IRREDUCIBLE POLYNOMIALS 
that 
ROOTS composed 
of a finite 
number 
of SQUARE 
ROOT extractions 
exist only 
if the order 
of the equation 
is of the form 
2h. That 
this condition 
was also NECES- 
SARY was not explicitly 
proven 
by Gauss, 
and the first 
proof 
of this fact is credited 
to Wantzel 
(1836). 
Constructible 
values 
of n for n < 300 were given 
by 
Gauss 
(Smith 
1994), 
and the first 
few are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, 24, 30, 32, 34, 40, 48, 51, 60,

120, 
128, 
136,

170, 
192, 
(Sloane’s 
A003401). 
Gardner 
(1977) 
and indepen- 
dently 
Watkins 
(Conway 
and 
Guy 
1996) 
noticed 
that 
the number 
of sides for constructible 
polygons 
with 
an 
ODD number 
of sides is given by the first 32 rows of PAS- 
CAL'S TRIANGLE (mod 
2) interpreted 
as BINARY num- 
bers, 
giving 
1, 3, 5, 15, 17, 51, 85, 255, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
AOO4729, 
Conway 
and Guy 
1996, p. 140).

Although 
constructions 
for 
the 
regular 
TRIANGLE, 
SQUARE, PENTAGON, and 
their 
derivatives 
had 
been 
given 
by Euclid, 
constructions 
based 
on the FERMAT 
PRIMES > 
17 were 
unknown 
to 
the 
ancients. 
The 
first explicit 
construction 
of a HEPTADE~AGON (17-gon) 
was given 
by Erchinger 
in about 
1800. 
Richelot 
and 
Schwendenwein 
found 
constructions 
for the 257-GON in 
1832, 
and Hermes 
spent 
10 years 
on the 
construction 
of the 65537-GON 
at Gettingen 
around 
1900 
(Coxeter 
1969). 
Constructions 
for the EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE 
and SQUARE are trivial 
(top figures 
below). 
Elegant 
con- 
structions 
for the PENTAGON and HEPTADECAGON are 
due to Richmond 
(1893) 
(bottom 
figures 
below).

Given 
a point, 
a CIRCLE may 
be constructed 
of 
desired 
RADIUS, and 
a DIAMETER drawn 
through 
center. 
Call 
the center 
0, and the right 
end of the 
AMETER PO. The 
DIAMETER PERPENDICULAR to 
original 
DIAMETER may 
be constructed 
by finding 
any 
the 
DI- 
the 
the 
PERPENDICULAR BISECTOR. 
Call 
the 
upper 
endpoint 
of this 
PERPENDICULAR DIAMETER B. 
For 
the 
PEN- 
TAGON, find the MIDPOINT 
of OB 
and call it D. 
Draw 
DPo, and BISECT LODPo, calling 
the intersection 
point 
with 
OPo 
Nl. 
Draw 
NIPI 
PARALLEL to OB, 
and the 
first 
two points 
of the PENTAGON are PO and 
PI. 
The 
construction 
for the HEPTADECAGON is more 
compli- 
cated, 
but 
can be accomplished 
in 17 relatively 
simple 
steps. 
The 
construction 
problem 
has now been 
auto- 
mated 
(Bishop 
1978).

Polygonal 
Number 
A type of FIGURATE NUMBER which 
is a generalization 
of TRIANGULAR, SQUARE, etc., numbers 
to an arbitrary 
n-gonal 
number. 
The 
above 
diagrams 
graphically 
illus- 
trate 
the process 
by which 
the polygonal 
numbers 
are 
built 
up. 
Starting 
with 
the nth TRIANGULAR NUMBER 
T,, 
then 
n + Tn.w1 = Tn. 
(1) 
Now note that 
n + 2T,-1 
= n2 = Sn 
(2) 
gives the nth SQUARE NUMBER, 
n-l- 3T,-1 
= $(3n 
- 1) = Pn, 
(3) 
gives the nth 
PENTAGONAL NUMBER, and so on. 
The 
general 
polygonal 
number 
can be written 
in the form 
PT” = $[(T-l)n-2(r-2)] 
= $r[(n.-2)r- 
(n-4)], 
(4) 
where p: is the rth 
n-gonal 
number. 
For example, 
tak- 
ing n = 3 in (4) gives a TRIANGULAR 
NUMBER, n = 4 
gives a SQUARE NUMBER, etc. 
Fermat 
proposed 
that 
every 
number 
is expressible 
as at 
most k k-gonalnumbers 
(FERMAT'S POLYGONAL NUM- 
BER THEOREM). Fermat 
claimed 
to have a proof 
of this 
result, 
although 
this 
proof 
has never 
been 
found. 
Ja- 
cobi, 
Lagrange 
(1772), 
and 
Euler 
all proved 
the square 
case, and Gauss 
proved 
the triangular 
case in 1796. 
In 
1813, Cauchy 
proved 
the proposition 
in its entirety. 
An arbi trary 
number 
Iv can be checked 
to see 
n-gonal 
number 
as follows. 
Note 
the identity 
if it is a 
8(n - 2)~: 
+ (n - 4)2 = 4r(n 
- 2)[(r 
- 1)n - 2(r - 2)] 
+(n 
- 4)2 = 4r(r 
- l)n2 
+ T[--8(~ 
- 1) - 8(r - 2)]n 
+16r(r 
- 2) + (n2 - 872 + 16) 
- - (4 T2 - 4r + l)n2 
+ (-16~~ 
+ 24r - 8)n 
+( 16r2 - 32~ + 16) 
- - (2 T - 1)2n2 - 8(2r2 
- 3r + 1)n + 16(r2 - 2r + 1) 
- - (2 rn - 4r - n + 4)2, 
(5) 
so 8(n - 2)N 
+ (n - 4)2 
= 
S2 must 
be a PERFECT 
SQUARE. Therefore, 
if it is not, 
the number 
cannot 
be 
n-gonal. 
If it is a PERFECT SQUARE, then 
solving 
S=2rn-4T-?I+4

Polyhedral 
Formula 
A formula 
relating 
the number 
of VERTICES, 
FACES, and 
EDGES 
ofa POLYHEDRON 
(or POLYGON). 
It wasdiscov- 
ered independently 
by Euler 
and Descartes, 
so it is also 
known 
as the 
DESCARTES-EULER 
POLYHEDRAL 
FOR- 
MULA. 
The 
polyhedron 
need not 
be CONVEX, 
but 
the 
FORMULA 
does not hold 
for STELLATED 
POLYHEDRA.

V = No is the number 
of VERTICES, 
E = Nl 
is 
the

of EDGES, 
and 
F = NZ is the 
number 
of 
FACES. 
For a proof, 
see Courant 
and 
Robbins 
(1978, 
pp. 239240). 
The 
FORMULA 
can be generalized 
to n-D 
POLYTOPES. 
A CONVEX

can be defined 
as the set of

are REGULAR 
(not

(Cromwell 
1997,

Polyhedron 
A 3-D solid 
which 
consists 
of a collection 
of POLYGONS, 
usually 
joined 
at their 
EDGES. 
The 
word 
derives 
from 
the Greek 
poly 
(many) 
plus 
the Indo-European 
he&on 
(seat). 
A polyhedron 
is the 
3-D 
version 
of the 
more 
general 
POLYTOPE, 
which 
can be defined 
on arbitrary 
dimensions. 
LAR POLYHEDRA:

There

92 CONVEX 
POLYHEDRA 
with REG- 
ULAR 
POLYGONAL 
faces (and 
not 
necessary 
equivalent 
vertices). 
They 
are known 
as the 
JOHNSON 
SOLIDS. 
Polyhedra 
with 
identical 
VERTICES 
related 
by a sym- 
metry 
operation 
are known 
as UNIFORM 
POLYHEDRA. 
There 
are 75 such polyhedra 
in which 
only 
two faces 
maymeetat 
an EDGE, 
and 76inwhich 
any EVEN num- 
ber 
of faces may 
meet. 
Of these, 
37 were discovered 
by Badoureau 
in 1881 
and 
12 by Coxeter 
and 
Miller 
ca. 1930. 
Polyhedra 
can be superposed 
on each other 
(with 
the 
sides allowed 
to pass through 
each other) 
to yield 
ad- 
ditional 
POLYHEDRON 
COMPOUNDS. 
Those 
made 
from 
REGULAR 
POLYHEDRA 
have symmetries 
which are espe- 
cially 
aesthetically 
pleasing. 
The 
graphs 
corresponding 
to polyhedra 
skeletons 
are called 
SCHLEGEL 
GRAPHS. 
Behnke 
et al. 
(1974) 
have

of all polyhedra

Coloring 
Define 
a valid 
“coloring” 
to occur 
when 
no two faces 
with 
a common 
EDGE share the same color. 
Given 
two 
colors, 
there 
is a single 
way to color 
an OCTAHEDRON. 
Given 
three colors, 
there 
is one way to color a CUBE and 
144 ways to color 
an IC~~AHEDRON. Given 
four-colors, 
there 
are two distinct 
ways to color 
a TETRAHEDRON 
and 4 ways to color 
a DODECAHEDRON. Given 
five col- 
ors, there 
are four ways to color 
an ICOSAHEDRON.

Polynomials 
of orders 
1 to 4 are solvable 
using 
only 
algebraic 
functions 
and 
finite 
square 
root 
extraction. 
A first-order 
equation 
is trivially 
solvable. 
A second- 
order 
equation 
is soluble 
using 
the 
QUADRATIC 
EQUA- 
TION. 
A third-order 
equation 
is solvable 
using 
the CU- 
BIC EQUATION. 
A fourth-order 
equation 
is solvable 
us- 
ing the QUARTIC EQUATION. 
It 
was proved 
by Abel 
using GROUP THEORY that 
higher 
order 
equations 
can- 
not be solved 
by finite 
root 
extraction. 
However, 
the general 
QUINTIC 
EQUATION 
may be given 
in terms 
of the THETA 
FUNCTIONS, 
or HYPERGEOMET- 
RIG FUNCTIONS 
in one variable. 
IIermite 
and Kronecker 
proved 
that 
higher 
order 
POLYNOMIALS 
are not soluble 
in the 
same 
manner. 
Klein 
showed 
that 
the 
work 
of 
Hermite 
was implicit 
in the GROUP properties 
of the 
I~OSAHEDRON. 
Klein’s 
method 
of solving 
the 
quintic 
in terms 
of HYPERGEOMETRIC 
FUNCTIONS 
in one vari- 
able can be extended 
to the sextic, 
but 
for higher 
order 
POLYNOMIALS, 
either 
HYPERGEOMETRIC 
FUNCTIONS 
in 
several 
variables 
or “Siegel 
functions” 
must 
be used. In 
the 188Os, Poincare 
created 
functions 
which 
give the so- 
lution 
to the nth 
order 
POLYNOMIAL 
equation 
in finite 
form. 
These 
functions 
turned 
out to be “natural” 
gen- 
eralizations 
of the ELLIPTIC 
FUNCTIONS. 
Given 
an nth 
degree 
POLYNOMIAL, 
the 
ROOTS 
can be 
found 
by finding

must 
have a NUMERATOR which 
is a factor 
of do and a DE- 
NOMINATOR which 
is a factor 
of d, 
(with 
either 
sign 
possible). 
This 
follows 
since a POLYNOMIAL of ORDER

k integral 
ROOTS can be expressed 
as 
(ala:

Any 
POLYNOMIAL 
can 
be 
numerically 
factored, 
al- 
though 
different 
ALGORITHMS have 
different 
strengths 
and weaknesses. 
Ifthere 
are no NEGATIVE ROOTS ofa POLYNOMMIAL (as 
can be determined 
by DESCARTES' SIGN RULE), then 
the GREATEST LOWER BOUND is 0. 
Otherwise, 
write 
out 
the COEFFICIENTS, let n = -1, 
and compute 
the 
next line. 
Now, if any COEFFICIENTS are 0, set them 
to 
minus 
the sign of the next higher 
COEFFICIENT, starting 
with 
the second 
highest 
order 
COEFFICIENT. 
If all the 
signs alternate, 
n is the greatest 
lower bound. 
If not, 
then 
subtract 
1 from 
n, and compute 
another 
line. 
For 
example, 
consider 
the POLYNOMIAL 
Y x 2x4 + 2x3 - 7x2 -I- x - 7. 
(11) 
Performing 
the above ALGORITHM then

so the greatest 
lower bound 
is -3. 
If there 
are no POSITIVE ROOTS of a POLYNOMIAL (as 
can be determined 
by DESCARTES' SXGN RULE), the 
LEAST UPPER BOUND is 0. 
Otherwise, 
write 
out 
the 
COEFFICIENTS of the POLYNOMIALS, including 
zeros as 
necessary. 
Let 
n = 
1. 
On the 
line 
below, 
write 
the 
highest 
order 
COEFFICIENT. 
Starting 
with 
the second- 
highest 
COEFFICIENT, add n-times 
the number 
just writ- 
ten to the original 
second COEFFICIENT, and write it be- 
low the second 
COEFFICIENT. 
Continue 
through 
order 
zero. 
If all the COEFFICIENTS are NONNEGATIVE, the 
least upper 
bound 
is n. If not, 
add one to x and repeat 
the process 
again. 
For example, 
take the POLYNOMIAL 
Y = 2x4 - x3 - 7x2 + x - 7.

Polyomino 
A generalization 
of the DOMINO. 
An n-omino 
is defined 
as a collection 
of 72 squares 
of equal 
size arranged 
with 
coincident 
sides. 
FREE 
polyominoes 
can be picked 
up 
and flipped, 
so mirror 
image 
pieces are considered 
iden- 
tical, 
whereas 
FIXED 
polyominoes 
are distinct 
if they 
have different 
chirality 
or orientation. 
FIXED 
polyomi- 
noes are also called 
LATTICE 
ANIMALS. 
Redelmeier 
(1981) 
computed 
the number 
of FREE 
and 
FIXED 
polyominoes 
for n 5 24, and Mertens 
(1990) gives 
a simple 
computer 
program. 
The 
sequence 
giving 
the 
number 
of FREE 
polyominoes 
of each 
order 
(Sloane’s 
AOO0105, 
Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987) is shown in the second

joined 
either 
at sides or corners. 
Because 
neighboring

to one another 
as KINGS 
may 
move 
on a CHESSBOARD, 
polyplets 
are sometimes 
also 
called

Polytope 
A convex polytope 
may be defined 
as the CONVEX 
HULL 
of a finite 
set of points 
(which 
are always bounded), 
or as 
the intersection 
of a finite 
set of half-spaces. 
Explicitly, 
a d-dimensional 
polytope 
may 
be specified 
as the set, of 
solutions 
to a system 
of linear 
inequalities 
mx 
< b, 
- 
where m is a real s x d MATRIX 
and b is a real S-VECTOR. 
The 
positions 
of the vertices 
given 
by the 
above 
equa- 
tions 
may be found 
using 
a process called 
VERTEX 
ENU- 
MERATION. 
A regular 
polytope 
is a generalization 
of the PLATONIC 
SOLIDS to an arbitrary 
DIMENSION. 
The 
NECESSARY 
condition 
for the figure 
with 
SCHL~FLI 
SYMBOL 
{p, q, r} 
to be a finite 
polytope 
is 
cos($ 
<sin(E)s 
SUFFICIENCY 
can be established 
by consideration 
of the 
six figures 
satisfying 
this 
condition. 
The 
table

Power 
(Circle) 
The 
POWER 
of the two points 
P and Q with 
respect 
to 
a CIRCLE 
is defined 
by 
p=OPxPQ. 
Let R be the RADIUS of a CIRCLE 
and d be the distance 
between 
a point 
P and 
the 
circle’s 
center. 
Then 
the 
POWER 
of the point 
P relative 
to the circle 
is 
p=d2-R2. 

Power Curve 
If P is outside 
the 
CIRCLE, 
its POWER 
is POSITIVE 
and 
equal 
to the square 
of the length 
of the segment 
from 
P 
to the tangent 
to the 
CIRCLE 
through 
P. 
If P is inside 
the CIRCLE, 
then the POWER 
is NEGATIVE 
and equal 
to 
the product 
of the DIAMETERS 
through 
P. 
The 
LOCUS 
of points 
having 
POWER 
k with 
regard 
to a 
fixed 
CIRCLE 
of RADIUS 
r is a CONCENTRIC 
CIRCLE 
of

The CHORDAL THEOREM states that 
the LOCUS 
of points 
having 
equal 
POWER with 
respect 
to two given 
nonconcentric 
CIRCLES 
is a line called 
the 
RADICAL 
LINE

Practical 
Number 
A number 
n is practical 
if for all k < n, k is the sum 
of distinct 
proper 
divisors 
of n. 
Defined 
in 
1948 
by 
A. K. Srinivasen. 
All even PERFECT NUMBERS 
are prac- 
tical. 
The 
number 
m = 2n-1(2n

Stated 
another 
way, the 
Pratt 
certificate 
gives a proof 
that 
a number 
a is a PRIMITIVE ROOT of the multiplica- 
tive 
GRoUP 
(mod 
p) which, 
along 
with 
the fact that 
a 
has order p - 1, proves 
that p is a PRIME.

The

77g18/37,

7 is a WITNESS for 7919. 
The PRIME divisors 
of 
7918 
= 7919 - 1 are 2, 37, and 
107. 
2 is a so-called 
%~~-WITNESS~’

it is recognized 
as a PRIME with-

Like

it is a proba-

using 
PSEUDOPRIMES,

(although 
with 
very

falsely 
identify

to be a P-PROBLEM 
(Wagon

In 
order

Representation 
Let 7r be a unitary 
REPRESENTATION 
of a GROUP G on 
a separable 
HEBERT 
SPACE, 
and let R(n) 
be the small- 
est weakly 
closed 
algebra 
of bounded 
linear 
operators 
containing 
all r(g) 
for g E G. Then 
7r is primary 
if the 
center 
of R(n) 
consists 
of only 
scalar 
operations.

Arithmetic 
Progression 
Let the number 
of PRIMES of the form 
nzk +n 
less than 
x be denoted 
r,,,(z). 
Then 
lim ~u,b(x) 
1 
-

Li(x) 
4(

a ’ 
where Li(z)isthe 
LOGARITHMIC INTEGRAL and 4(x)is 
the TOTIENT 
FUNCTION. 
Let 
P 
be an 
increasing 
arithmetic 
progression 
of n 
PRIMES with 
minimal 
difference 
d > 0. 
If a PRIME 
p 5 n does not divide 
d, then 
the elements 
of P must 
assume 
all residues 
modulo 
p, specifically, 
some element 
of P must 
be divisible 
by p. Whereas 
P contains 
only 
primes, 
this element 
must 
be equal 
to p. 
If d < n# 
(where 
n# 
is the PRIMORIAL of n), then some 
prime 
p 2 n does not divide 
d, and that 
prime 
p is in P. 
Thus, 
in order 
to determine 
if P has d < n#, 
we need 
only check a finite 
number 
of possible 
P (those with 
d < 
n# 
and containing 
prime 
p 2 n) to see if they 
contain 
only 
primes. 
If not, 
then 
d > 
n#. 
If d = 
n#, 
then 
- 
the elements 
of P cannot 
be made 
to cover all residues 
of any prime 
p. The 
PRIME PATTERNS CONJECTURE 
then 
asserts 
that 
there 
are infinitely 
many 
arithmetic 
progressions 
of primes 
with 
difference 
d. 
A computation 
shows that 
the smallest 
possible 
common 
difference 
for a set of n or more 
PRIMES in arithmetic 
progression 
for n = 1, 2, 3, 
l . l is 0, 1, 2, 6, 6, 30, 150,

1989,

and

1997, 
Wilson). 
The values up to n = 13 are rigorous, 
while the 
remainder 
are lower 
bounds 
which 
assume 
the validity 
of the PRIME PATTERNS CONJECTURE and are simply 
given by pn-7#, 
where pi is the ith PRIME. The smallest 
first 
terms 
of arithmetic 
progressions 
of n primes 
with 
minimal 
differences 
are 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 199,

progression 
is

for k = 0, 1, 
l . . , 5 (Lander 
and Parkin 
1967, Dubner 
and 
Nelson 
1997). 
According 
to Dubner 
et al., a trillion-fold 
increase 
in computer 
speed is needed 
before 
the search 
for a sequence 
of 11 consecutive 
primes 
is practical, 
so 
they 
expect 
the ten-primes 
record 
to stand 
for a long 
time 
to come. 
It is conjectured 
that there 
are arbitrarily 
long sequences 
of PRIMES in ARITHMETIC 
PROGRESSION (Guy 
1994).

325 x 106], and [400 x 106, 418 x 106]. 
Heuristic 
arguments 
by Rivera

suggest 
that 
the maximum 
possible 
number 
of primes 
in 4 x 4, 5 x 
5, and 6 x 6 arrays 
are 58-63,

a PRIME 
~TUPLE 
or 
PRIME 
~TUPLET, 
is a sequence 
of Iz consecutive 
num- 
bers such that 
the difference 
between 
the first 
and last 
is, in some 
sense, 
the 
least 
possible. 
More 
precisely, 
a prime 
k-tuplet 
is a sequence 
of consecutive 
PRIMES 
(pl, 
~2, 
. . . , pk) 
with 
pk - pl 
= 
s(k), 
where 
s(k) 
is 
the smallest 
number 
s for which 
there 
exist 
k integers 
bl < bz < ..- < bk, bk -bl 
= s and, 
for every 
PRIME 
q, 
not all the residues 
modulo 
Q are represented 
by bl, b2, 
bl, (Forbes). 
For each k, this 
definition 
excludes 
a 
i&e 
number 
of clusters 
at the beginning 
of the prime 
number 
sequence. 
For example, 
(97, 101, 103, 107, 109) 
satisfies 
the 
conditions 
of the 
definition 
of a prime 
5- 
tuplet, 
but 
(3, 5, 7, 11, 13) does not 
because 
all three 
residues 
modulo 
3 are represented 
(Forbes). 
A prime 
double 
with 
s(2) = 2 is of the form 
(p, p + 2) 
and is called 
a pair 
of TWIN 
PRIMES. 
Prime 
doubles 
of 

1426 
Prime Constellation 
the form 
(p, p + 6) are called 
SEXY PRIMES. A prime 
triplet 
has s(3) = 6. H owever, the constellation 
(p, p+Z, 
p + 4) cannot 
exist, 
since both 
p + 2 and p + 4 cannot 
be PRIME. 
However, 
there 
are several 
types 
of prime 
triplets 
which 
can exist: 
(p, P + 2, p + 6), (p, p + 4, 
p + S), (p, p + 6, p + 12). 
A PRIME QUADRUPLET is 
a constellation 
of four successive 
PRIMES with 
minimal 
distance 
s(4) = 8, and 
is of the form 
(p, p + 2, p + 6, 
p + 8). The 
sequence 
s(n) 
therefore 
begins 
2, 6, 8, and 
continues 
12, 16, 20, 26, 30, . . l 
(Sloane’s 
A008407). 
Another 
quadruplet 
constellation 
is (p, p + 6, p + 12, 
p+ 18).

Find 
two numbers 
such that 
x2 E y2 (mod

If you 
know the GREATEST 
COMMON 
DIVISOR 
of n and 51: - y, 
there 
exists 
a high 
probability 
of determining 
a PRIME 
factor. 
Taking 
small 
numbers 
z which 
additionally 
give 
small

x2 = p (mod

further 
increases 
the 
chances 
of finding 
a PRIME 
factor. 
are also equinumerous. 
Erd& 
proved 
that 
there 
exist 
at least one PRIME 
of the

Algorithms 
Many 
ALGORITHMS 
have been 
devised 
for determining 
the PRIME 
factors 
of a given number. 
They 
vary quite 
a 
bit in sophistication 
and complexity. 
It is very difficult 
to build 
a general-purpose 
algorithm 
for this 
computa- 
tionally 
“hard” 
problem, 
so any additional 
information 
which is known 
about 
the number 
in question 
or its fac- 
tors can often 
be used to save a large 
amount 
of time. 
The 
simplest 
method 
of finding 
factors 
is so-called 
“DI- 
RECT 
SEARCH 
FACTORIZATION" 
(a.k.a. 
TRIAL 
DIVI- 
SION). 
In this 
method, 
all possible 
factors 
are system- 
atically 
tested 
using 
trial 
division 
to see if they actually 
DIVIDE 
the given 
number. 
It is practical 
only 
for very 
small 
numbers.

Let p(d)

P(8W

The

10314 - 1929 (Baugh 
and 
O’Hara

this

certainly 
not maximal 
(i.e., 
there 
probably 
exists 
a smaller 
number 
having 
a gap of 
the same length 
following 
it). 
Let 
c(n) 
be the 
smallest 
starting 
INTEGER c(n) 
for a 
run of n consecutive 
COMPOSITE NUMBERS, also called 
a COMPOSITE RUN. 
No general

ex-

is known 
for determining 
the first oc- 
currence 
for a maximal

although 
arbitrarily 
large

exist 
(Nicely 
1998).

and 
Shanks 
(1964) 
conjectured 
that 
a maximal

Wolf 
conjectures 
that 
the maximal

approximately 
at 
7r(n)[2Irm(n) 
-Jnn

where r(n) 
is the PRIME COUNTING FUNCTION and CZ 
is the 
TWIN

The

for n =

24, 90, 90, 114, . . . (Sloane’s

The

omitting 
degenerate

The above table 
gives some low-order 
polynomials 
which 
generate 
only 
PRIMES for the 
first 
few NONNEGATIVE 
values 
(Mollin 
and Williams 
1990). 
The 
best-known 
of 
these 
formulas 
is that 
due 
to Euler 
(Euler 
1772, 
Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987). 
Le Lionnais 
(1983) 
has christened 
numbers 
p such that 
the Euler-like 
polynomial 
n2 -n+p 
(1) 
is PRIME for p = 0, 1, . . . . p - 2 as LUCKY NUMBERS 
OF EULER (where 
the case p = 41 corresponds 
to Eu- 
ler ‘s formula) 
l 
Rabinovitch 
(1913) 
showed 
that 
for a 
PRIME p > 0, Euler’s 
polynomial 
represents 
a PRIME 
for n E [O,p - 21 (excluding 
the trivial 
case p = 3) IFF 
the FIELDQ(~~) 
has CLASS NUMBER h=l(Rabi- 
nowitz 
1913, Le Lionnais 
1983, Conway 
and Guy 
1996). 
As established 
by Stark 
(1967), 
there 
are only nine num- 
bers -d 
such that 
h(-d) 
= 1 (the 
HEEGNER 
NUMBERS 
-2, 
-3, 
-7, 
-11, 
-19, 
-43, 
-67, 
and 
-163), 
and of 
these, 
only 
7, 11, 19, 43, 67, 
and 
163 are of the 
re- 
quired 
form. 
Therefore, 
the only 
LUCKY 
NUMBERS OF 
EULER are 2, 3, 5, 11, 17, and 
41 (Le Lionnais 
1983, 
Sloane’s 
A014556), 
and 
there 
does 
not 
exist 
a better 
prime-generating 
polynomial 
of Euler’s 
form. 
Euler 
also considered 
quadratics 
of the form 
2x2 +p 
(2) 

1432 
Prime-Generating 
Polynomial 
Prime Number 
and showed this gives PRIMES for Al: E [O,p-1] 
for PRIME 
p > 0 IFF Q(J?$) 
has CLASS NUMBER 2, which 
per- 
mits 
only p = 3, 5, 11, and 29. Baker 
(1971) 
and Stark 
(1971) 
showed that 
there 
are so such FIELDS for p > 29. 
Similar 
results 
have been found 
for POLYNOMIALS of the 
form 
px2-+px+n 
(3) 
(Hendy 
1974).

A prime 
number 
is a POSITIVE 
INTEGER 
p which 
has 
no DIVISORS 
other 
than 
1 and p itself. 
Although 
the 
number 
1 used to be considered 
a prime, 
it requires 
spe- 
cial 
treatment 
in so many 
definitions 
and 
applications 
involving 
primes 
greater 
than 
or equal 
to 2 that 
it is 
usually 
placed 
into 
a class of its own. 
Since 
2 is the 
only 
EVEN 
prime, 
it is also somewhat 
special, 
so the set 
of all primes 
excluding 
2 is called 
the 
“ODD 
PRIMES.” 
The first few primes 
are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29,

other 
than 
1 which

are called

The function 
which 
gives the number 
of primes 
less than 
a number 
n is denoted 
r(n) 
and 
is called 
the 
PRIME

However, 
it is not known 
if there 
are 
an infinite 
number 
of primes 
of the form 
x2 + 1, whether 
there 
are an INFINITE 
number 
of TWIN

or if a 
prime 
can always 
be found 
between 
n2 and (n + 1)2. 
Prime 
numbers 
satisfy 
many 
strange 
and 
wonderful 
properties. 
For 
example, 
there 
exists 
a CONSTANT 
0 z 1.3064 
known 
as MILLS' 
CONSTANT 
such that 
Prime 
numbers 
can be generated 
by sieving 
processes 
(suchasthe 
ERATOSTHENES

and LUCKY 
NUM- 
BERS, 
which 
are also generated 
by sieving, 
appear 
to 
share 
some 
interesting 
asymptotic 
properties 
with 
the 
primes. 
L J

where 
1x1 is the FLOOR

it is not known

FACTORIZATION 
ALGORITHMS 
have been 
devised 
for determining 
the prime 
factors 
of a given 
IN- 
TEGER. 
They 
vary quite 
a bit in sophistication 
and com- 
plexity. 
It 
is very 
difficult 
to build 
a general-purpose 
algorithm 
for this 
computationally 
“hard” 
problem, 
so 
any additional 
information 
which 
is known 
about 
the 
number 
in question 
or its factors 
can often 
be used to 
save a large 
amount 
of time. 
The 
simplest 
method 
of 
finding 
factors 
is so-called 
“DIRECT 
SEARCH 
FACTOR- 
IZATION" 
(a.k.a. 
TRIAL 
DIVISION). 
In this 
method, 
all 
possible 
factors 
are systematically 
tested 
using 
trial 
di- 
vision 
to see if they 
actually 
DIVIDE 
the given 
number. 
It is practical 
only 
for very small 
numbers. 
Hecause 
of their 
importance 
in encryption 
algorithms 
such 
as RSA 
ENCRYPTION, 
prime 
numbers 
can 
be 
important 
commercial 
commodities. 
In 
fact, 
Roger 
Schlafly 
has obtained 
U.S. 
Patent 
5,373,560 
(12/13/94) 
on the following 
two primes 
(expressed 
in hexadecimal 
notation):

for every n 2 1.

for the nth

both 
as a

(Hardy

It not only generates

For example, 
(Blatner

Conway 
(Guy 
1983, 
Conway 
and Guy 
1996, 
p. 147) gives 
an algorithm 
for generating

on 14 fractions,

just 
a concealed 
version 
of a SIEVE.

It

a DIOPHANTINE

(Ribenboim

Ramanujan 
also showed

The probability 
that 
the largest 
prime 
factor 
of a RAN- 
DOM NUMBER x is less than

is In 2 (Beeler 
et al. 
1972, 
Item

The 
probability 
that 
two INTEGERS 
picked 
at random 
are RELATIVELY PRIME is [5(2)1-l 
= 
G/n2 7 where C(z) is the RIEMANN ZETA FUNCTION (Ce- 
saro and Sylvester 
1883). 
G iven three 
INTEGERS 
chosen

the probability 
that

them 
all is 
Ir(w” 
z 1.202-l 
= 0.832..

(28) 
where c(3) is AP~RY'S CONSTANT. In general, 
the prob- 
ability 
that 
n random 
numbers 
lack a pth POWER com- 
mon 
divisor 
is [C(q+]-l 
(Beeler 
et al. 1972, Item

include 
the 
large 
MERSENNE PRIMES,

Number 
of Measurement 
The 
set of numbers 
generated 
by excluding 
the SUMS of 
two or more 
consecutive 
earlier 
members 
is called 
the 
prime 
numbers 
of measurement, 
or sometimes 
the SEG- 
MENTED NUMBERS. The 
first 
few terms 
are 1, 2, 4, 5, 
8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 21, . . . (Sloane’s 
A002048). 
Excluding 
two and three 
terms 
gives the sequence 
1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 
24, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, . . . (Sloane’s 
A005242).

The 
theorem 
giving 
an asymptotic 
form 
for the PRIME 
C~VNTING FUNCTION r(n) 
for number 
of PRIMES less 
than 
some INTEGER 
n. Legendre 
(1808) 
suggested 
that, 
for large 
n, 
7+x> - 
n 
Alnn+B’ 
(1) 
with 
A = 1 and B = -1.08366 
(where 
B is sometimes 
called 
LEGENDRE’S 
CONSTANT), a formula 
which 
is cor- 
rect in the leading 
term 
only 
(Wagon 
1991, 
pp. 28-29). 
In 1791, Gauss became 
the first to suggest 
instead 
Prime 
Number 
Theorem 
Gauss 
later 
refined 
his estimate 
to 
44 
- Li(n), 
(3) 
where Li(n) 
is the LOGARITHMIC INTEGRAL. This 
func- 
tion 
has n/ In n as the leading 
term 
and has been shown 
to be a better 
estimate 
than 
n/Inn 
alone. 
The 
state- 
ment 
(3) is often known 
as “the” 
prime 
number 
theorem 
and was proved 
independently 
by Hadamard 
and Vallke 
Poussin 
in 1896. 
A plot 
of r(n) 
(lower curve) 
and Li(n) 
is shown 
above 
for n 5 1000. 
For small 
n, it has been checked 
and always 
found 
that 
r(n) 
< Li(n). 
However, 
Skewes 
proved 
that 
the first 
crossing 
of r(n) 
- Li(n) 
= 0 occurs 
before 
10101’ 
34 
(th e 
SKEWES NUMBER). 
The 
upper 
bound 
for the crossing 
has subsequently 
been 
reduced 
to 
10371. 
Littlewood 
(1914) 
proved 
that 
the INEQUALITY 
reverses 
infinitely 
often 
for sufficiently 
large 
n (Ball 
and 
Coxeter 
1987). 
Lehman 
(1966) 
p roved 
that 
at least 
10500 reversals 
oc- 
cur for numbers 
with 
1166 or 1167 DECIMAL DIGITS. 
Chebyshev 
(Rubinstein 
and Sarnak 
1994) put 
limits 
on 
the RATIO 
7 
44 
9 
s<- 
In”, 
< 
g’ 
(4 
and showed 
that 
if the LIMIT 
lim I 
n+m Inn, 
(5) 
existed, 
then 
it would 
be 1. This 
is, in fact, the prime 
number 
theorem. 
Hadamard 
and Vallee 
Poussin 
proved 
the prime 
number 
theorem 
by showing 
that 
the RIEMANN ZETA FUNCTION 
C(Z) has no zeros of the form 
l+it 
(Smith 
1994, p. 128). 
In particular, 
Vallke 
Poussin 
showed 
that 
x(x) 
= Li(z) 
+ 0 
( 
&PG) 
(6) 
for some 
constant 
a. 
A simplified 
proof 
was found 
by 
Selberg 
and Erdes 
(1949) 
(Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987, p. 63). 
Riemann 
estimated 
the PRIME COUNTING FUNCTION 
with 
r(n) 
- Li(n) 
- + Li(n1’2), 
(7) 
which 
is a better 
approximation 
than 
Li(n) 
for n < 107. 
Riemann 
(1859) 
also suggested 
the RIEMANN FUNCTION 
R(x) = x 
T 
Li(x’/“), 
(8) 
n=l 
where p is the MOBIUS FUNCTION (Wagon 
1991, pa 29). 
An even better 
approximation 
for small 
n (by a factor 
of 10 for n < 10’) 
is the GRAM SERIES.

The 
prime 
number 
theorem 
is equivalent 
to 
lim 
2 
= 1, 
tic 
> 
x--+m 
2 
(9) 
where 
@J(X) 
is the SUMMATORY 
MANGOLDT 
FUNCTION. 
The 
RIEMANN 
HYPOTHESIS 
is equivalent 
to the asser- 
tion 
that 
1 Li(x) 
- n(z)] 
5 cfi 
In x 
(10) 
for some 
value 
of c (fngham 
1932, 
Ball 
and 
Coxeter 
1987). 
Some 
limits 
obtained 
without 
assuming 
the RIE- 
MANN 
HYPOTHESIS 
are 
T(X) 
= Li(x) 
+ O[ze-(1n”J1’2’15] 
(11) 
r(x) 
= Li(x) 
+ ~[xe-0*00g(1nx)3’5/(1n1n~~1’5], 
(12) 
Ramanujan 
showed 
that 
for sufficiently 
large 
x, 
The largest 
known 
PRIME 
for which the inequality 
fails is 
38,358,837,677 
(B erndt 
1994, pp. 112-113). 
The related 
inequality 
Li2(x) 
< ZLi

is true 
for x 2 2418 (Berndt

Quadratic 
Effect 
Let 
~~,~(x) 
denote 
th e number 
of PRIMES 
5 II= which 
are congruent 
to n modulo 
nz. Then 
one might 
expect 
that 
A(x) E T&3(2) - ?T4,1(x) - +“(x1/2) 
> 0 
(Berndt 
1994). 
Although 
this is true 
for small 
numbers, 
Hardy 
and 
Littlewood 
showed 
that 
n(x) 
changes 
sign 
infinitely 
often. 
(The 
first number 
for which 
it is false is 
26861.) 
The effect was first noted 
by Chebyshev 
in 1853, 
and is sometimes 
called 
the CHEBYSHEV 
PHENOMENON. 
It was subsequently 
studied 
by Shanks 
(1959), 
Hudson 
(1980), 
and 
Bays and Hudson 
(1977, 
1978, 
1979). 
The 

1438 
Prime 
Quadruplet

effect 
was also noted 
by Ramanujan, 
who incorkectly 
claimed 
that 
lims+oo 
a(x) 
= 00 (Berndt 
1994).

Recursive 
Function 
For-loops 
(which 
have a fixed

limit) 
are a spe- 
cial case of while-loops. 
A function 
which 
can be imple- 
mented 
using only for-loops 
is called 
primitive 
recursive. 
(In 
contrast, 
a COMPUTABLE FUNCTION 
can be coded 
using 
a combination 
of for- and 
while-loops, 
or while- 
loops 
only.) 
The ACKERMANN FUNCTION is the simplest 
example 
of 
awe&defined 
TOTAL FUNCTION whichis 
COMPUTABLE 
but not primitive 
recursive, 
providing 
a counterexample 
to the belief 
in the early 
1900s that 
every COMPUTABLE 
FUNCTION was also primitive 
recursive 
(D&e1 
1991).

A number 
g is a primitive 
root 
of m if 
gk $1 
(mod 
m) 
(1) 
for 1 < k < vz and 
- 
gm E 1 (mod 
m) . 
(2) 
Only 
m, = 2, 4, pa, and 2~” have primitive 
roots 
(where 
p > 2 and a is an INTEGER). 
For composite 
nz, there 
may 
be more 
than 
one primitive 
root 
(both 
3 and 
7 
are primitive 
roots 
mod 
lo), 
but 
for prime 
p, there 
is 
only 
one primitive 
root. 
It is the INTEGER g satisfying 
1 <g 
<p- 
1 such that 
g (modp) 
has ORDERI,- 
1. 
The 
primitive 
root 
of m. can also be defined 
as a cyclic 
generator 
of the multiplicative 
group 
(mod 
m) when m 
is a prime 
POWER 
or twice 
a PRIME 
POWER. 
Let p be 
any ODD PRIME k 2 1, and let

Then

For

m with 
primitive

able as 
roots, 
all 
y satisfying 
y G gt (mod 
m) , 
(5) 
where t = 0, 1,. . . , 4(m)--1, 
t is known 
as the index, 
and 
y is an INTEGER. Kearnes 
showed that 
for any POSITIVE 
INTEGER 
m, there 
exist 
infinitely 
many 
PRIMES p such 
that 
m<g,<p-mm.

Call

that 
for C and E PUS~TIVE constants

Prisoner’s 
Dilemma 
A 
problem 
in 
GAME 
THEORY 
first 
discussed 
by 
A. Tucker. 
Suppose 
each of two prisoners 
A and 
B, 
who are not 
allowed 
to communicate 
with 
each other, 
is offered 
to be set free if he implicates 
the other. 
If 
neither 
implicates 
the other, 
both 
will receive 
the usual 
sentence. 
However, 
if the prisoners 
implicate 
each other, 
then 
both 
are presumed 
guilty 
and granted 
harsh 
sen- 
tences. 
A DILEMMA arises in deciding 
the best course of action 
in the absence 
of knowledge 
of the other 
prisoner’s 
deci- 
sion. 
Eaih 
prisoner’s 
best strategy 
would 
appear 
to be 
to turn 
the other 
in (since if A makes 
the worst-case 
as- 
sumption 
that 
B will 
turn 
him 
in, then 
B will walk free 
and A will 
be stuck 
in jail 
if he remains 
silent). 
How- 
ever, if the prisoners 
turn 
each other 
in, they obtain 
the 
worst possible 
outcome 
for both.

Probability 
1445 
Probability 
Probability 
is the branch 
of mathematics 
which 
studies 
the possible 
outcomes 
of given 
events together 
with their 
relative 
likelihoods 
and distributions. 
In common 
usage, 
the word 
“probability” 
is used to mean 
the chance 
that 
a particular 
event 
(or set of events) 
will occur expressed 
on a linear 
scale from 
0 (impossibility) 
to 1 (certainty), 
also expressed 
as a PERCENTAGE between 
0 and 100%. 
The 
analysis 
of events 
governed 
by probability 
is called 
STATISTICS. 
There 
are several 
competing 
interpretations 
of the ac- 
tual 
“meaning” 
of probabilities. 
FYrequentists 
view prob- 
ability 
simply 
as a measure 
of the 
frequency 
of out- 
comes 
(the 
more 
conventional 
interpretation), 
while 
BAYESIANS treat 
probability 
more 
subjectively 
as a sta- 
tistical 
procedure 
which 
endeavors 
to estimate 
parame- 
ters of an underlying 
distribution 
based on the observed 
distribution. 
A properly 
normalized 
function 
which 
assigns 
a proba- 
bility 
“density” 
to each possible 
outcome 
within 
some 
interval 
is called 
a PROBABILITY FUNCTION, and its cu- 
mulative 
value 
(integral 
for a continuous 
distribution 
or 
sum for a discrete 
distribution) 
is called 
a DISTRIBUTION 
FUNCTION. 
Probabilities 
are defined 
to obey 
certain 
assumptions, 
called 
the PROBABILITY AXIOMS. Let a SAMPLE SPACE 
contain 
the UNION (U) 
of all possible 
events 
Ei, 
so 
(1) 
and let E and F denote 
subsets 
of S. Further, 
let F’ = 
not-F 
be the complement 
of F, so 
F u F’ = S. 
Then 
the set E can be written 
as 
that 
(2) 
E=EnS=En(FUF’)=(EnF)U(EnF’), 
(3) 
where n denotes 
the intersection. 
Then 
P(E) 
= P(E n F) + P(E 
n F’) 
- P[(E 
n F) n (En 
F’)] 
=P(EnF)+P(EnF’)-P[(FnF’)n(EnE)] 
= P(E 
n F) + P(E 
n F’) 
- P(O n E) 
= P(E 
n F) + P(E 
n F’) 
- P(0) 
= P(E 
n F) + P(E 
n F’), 
(4) 
where 
0 is the EMPTY SET.

Probability 
Axioms 
Let P(EIF) 
d enote 
the CONDITIONAL 
PROBABILITY of 
E given 
that 
F has already 
occurred, 
then 
P(E) 
= P(EIF)P(F) 
+ P(EIF’)P(F’) 
(5) 
= P(EIF)P(F) 
+ P(EIF’)[l 
- P(F)] 
(6) 
P(An 
B) = P(A)P(BIA) 
= P(B)P(AIB) 
P(A’ n B) = P(A’)P(BIA’) 
P(E]F) 
= p(;(;)F) 
A very important 
result 
states 
that 
P(E 
u F) = P(E) 
+ P(F) 
- P(E 
n F),

Projection 
Operator 
Projection 
A projection 
is the transformation 
of POINTS 
and LINES 
in one PLANE 
onto another 
PLANE 
by connecting 
corre- 
sponding 
points 
on the two planes 
with PARALLEL 
lines. 
This 
can be visualized 
as shining 
a (point) 
light 
source 
(located 
at infinity) 
through 
a translucent 
sheet of paper 
and making 
an image 
of whatever 
is drawn 
on it on a 
second 
sheet of paper. 
The 
branch 
of geometry 
dealing 
with 
the properties 
and invariants 
of geometric 
figures 
under 
projection 
is called 
PROJECTIVE 
GEOMETRY. 
The projection 
of a VECTOR 
a onto 
a VECTOR 
u is given 
bY 
8.u 
proj,a 
= mu, 
I I 
and the length 
of this projection 
is 
Iproj,al 
= v. 
General 
projections 
are considered 
by Foley 
and 
Van- 
Dam 
(1983).

which transforms 
every 1-D form 
pro- 
jectively. 
Any 
COLLINEATION 
which 
transforms 
one 
range 
into 
a projectively 
related 
range 
is a projective 
collineation. 
Every 
PERSPECTIVE 
COLLINEATI~N 
is a 
projective 
collineation.

Projective 
Geometry 
The branch 
of geometry 
dealing 
with 
the properties 
and 
invariants 
of geometric 
figures 
under 
PROJECTION. 
The 
most 
amazing 
result 
arising 
in projective 
geometry 
the 
DUALITY 
PRINCIPLE, 
which 
states 
that 
a duali 
is 
tY 
exists 
between 
theorems 
such 
as PASCAL'S 
THEOREM 
and B RIANCHO l~1~ THEOREM 
which 
allows one to be in- 
stantly 
transformed 
into 
the other. 
More 
generally, 
all 
the 
propositions 
in projective 
geometry 
occur 
in dual 
pairs, 
which 
have the 
property 
that, 
starting 
from 
ei- 
ther proposition 
of a pair, 
the other 
can be immediately 
inferred 
by interchanging 
the parts 
played 
by the words 
“POINT" 
and 
LCL~~~." 
The 
AXIOMS 
of projective 
geometry 
are: 
1. 
2. 
6. 
If A and B are distinct 
points 
on a PLANE, 
there 
is 
at least one LINE 
containing 
both 
A and 23. 
If A and B are distinct 
points 
on a PLANE, 
there 
is 
not more 
than 
one LINE 
containing 
both 
A and B. 
Any 
two LINES 
on a PLANE 
have at least 
one point 
of the PLANE 
in common. 
There 
is at least 
one LINE 
on a PLANE. 
Every 
LINE 
contains 
at least 
three 
points 
of the 
PLANE. 
All 
the points 
of the 
PLANE 
do not 
belong 
to the 
same LINE 
(Veblin

Projective 
Plane 
A projective 
plane 
is derived 
from 
a usual 
PLANE by 
addition 
of a LINE AT INFINITY. 
A projective 
plane 
of 
order. n is a set of n2 + n + 1 POINTS with 
the properties 
that: 
1. Any two POINTS determine 
a LINE, 
2. Any two LINES determine 
a POINT, 
3. Every 
POINT has n + 1 LINES on it, and 
4. Every 
LINE contains 
n + 1 POINTS. 
(Note 
that 
some 
of these properties 
are redundant*) 
A 
projective 
plane 
is therefore 
a SYMMETRIC (n2 + n + 1, 
n + 
1,

BLOCK 
DESIGN. 
An 
AFFINE 
PLANE of order 
n exists TFF a projective 
plane 
of order 
n exists. 
A finite 
projective 
plane 
exists 
when 
the 
order 
n is a 
POWER of a PRIME, i.e., 
n = p” for a 2 1. 
It is conjec- 
tured 
that 
these are the only possible 
projective 
planes, 
but proving 
this remains 
one of the most 
important 
un- 
solved 
problems 
in COMBINATORICS. 
The 
first 
few or- 
ders which 
are not 
of this 
form 
are 6, 10, 12, 14, 15, 
It has been 
proven 
analytically 
that 
there 
are no pro- 
jective 
planes 
of order 
6. By answering 
LAM'S PROB- 
LEM in the negative 
using massive 
computer 
calculations 
on top 
of some 
mathematics, 
it has been 
proved 
that 
there 
are no finite 
projective 
planes 
of order 
10 (Lam 
1991). 
The 
status 
of the order 
12 projective 
plane 
re- 
mains 
open. 
The 
remarkable 
BRUCK-RYSER-CHOWLA 
THEOREM says that 
if a projective 
plane 
of order 
n ex- 
ists, and n = 1 or 2 (mod 
4), then 
n is the sum of two 
SQUARES. This 
rules out 
n = 6. 
The projective 
plane 
of order 
2, also known 
as the FANO 
PLANE, is denoted 
PG(2, 
2). Tt has TNCIDENCE MATRIX

Proof 
A rigorous 
mathematical 
argument 
which 
unequivocally 
demonstrates 
the 
truth 
of a given 
PROPOSITION. 
A 
mathematical 
statement 
which 
has been proven 
is called 
a THEOREM. 
There 
is some 
debate 
among 
mathematicians 
as to just 
what 
constitutes 
a proof. 
The 
FOUR-COLOR 
THEOREM 
is an example 
of this 
debate, 
since its “proof” 
relies 
on 
an exhaustive 
computer 
testing 
of many 
individual 
cases 
which cannot 
be verified 
“by hand.” 
While 
many 
mathe- 
maticians 
regard 
computer-assisted 
proofs 
as valid, 
some 
purists 
do not.

Proofreading 
Mistakes 
If proofreader 
A finds 
a mistakes 
and 
proofreader 
B 
finds b mistakes, 
c of which 
were also found 
by A, how 
many 
mistakes 
were missed 
by both 
A and B? Assume 
there 
are a total 
of m mistakes, 
so proofreader 
A finds a 
FRACTION 
a/m 
of all mistakes, 
and also a FRACTION 
c/b 
of the mistakes 
found 
by B. 
Assuming 
these 
fractions 
are the same, 
then 
solving 
for m gives 
ab 
m= 
-. 
C 
The 
number 
of mistakes 
missed 
by both 
is therefore 
ap- 
proximately 
N=m-a-b+c= 
(u-c)(b-c)

Proves

be RATIONAL. 
Assume

is 
rational

with 
no common 
factors. 
Then 
p and q are INTEGERS 
d2 = s2 + 5’ = 2521 
and p2 = 2q2, so p2 is even. 
But 
if p2 is EVEN, 
then 
p 
is EVEN. 
Since p/q 
is defined 
to be expressed 
in lowest 
terms, 
q must be ODD; otherwise 
p and q would 
have the 
common 
factor 
2. Since 
p is EVEN, 
we can let p G 2r, 
then 
4r2 = 2q2. Therefore, 
q2 = 2r2, and q2, so q must 
be EVEN. 
But 
q cannot 
be both 
EVEN

ODD, 
so 
there 
are no d and s such that

Many

of 
all geometric

A clever

one was given 
by the Ara-

In the above

the 
AREA 
of the large 
SQUARE 
is 
four times 
the AREA 
of one of the 
TRIANGLES 
plus the 
AREA 
of the interior

From 
the figure, 
d = b-a, 
so 
A = 4($ab) 
+ d2 = 2ab + (b - a)” 
= 2ab + b2 - 
2ab + a2 
=a2+b2=C2* 
(5) 
Perhaps 
the most 
famous 
proof 
of all times 
is Euclid’s 
geometric 
proof. 
Euclid’s 
proof 
used the figure 
below, 
which 
is sometimes 
known 
variously 
as the 
BRIDE'S

PEACOCK’S

or

Let 
AABC 
be 
a 
RIGHT 
TRIANGLE, 
q CAFG, 
q CBKH, 
and mABED 
be squares, 
and CLllBD. 
The 
TRIANGLES 
AFAB 
and 
AC..4D 
are equivalent 
except 
for rotation, 
so 
2AFAB 
= 2ACAD. 
(6) 
Shearing 
these 
TRIANGLES 
gives 
two more 
equivalent 
TRIANGLES 
2ACAD 
= DADLM. 
(7) 
Therefore, 
q ACGF 
= IADLM. 
(8) 
Similarly, 
L?1BC = 2AABK 
= 2aBCE 
= DBL 
(9) 
so 
a2 + b2 = cx + c(c - x) = c2. 
(10) 
Heron 
proved 
that 
AK, 
CL, 
and BF 
intersect 
in a point 
(Dunham 
1990, pp. 48-53). 
HERON'S 
FORMULA 
for the AREA 
of the TRIANGLE, 
con- 
tains 
the 
Pythagorean 
theorem 
implicitly. 
Using 
the 
form 
K = ad2a2b2 
+ 2a2c2 + ab2c2 - (a4 + b4 + c4) 
(11) 
and equating 
to the AREA 
K=iab 
(12) 
gives 
aa2b2 
= 2a2b2 + 2a2c2 + ab2c2 - (a4 + b4 + c”). 
(13) 
Rearranging 
and simplifying 
gives 
a2+b2=c2, 
the 
Pythagorean 
theorem, 
where 
K 
is the 
AREA 
of 
a TRIANGLE 
with 
sides 
a, b, and 
c (Dunham 
1990, 
pp. 128-129). 
A novel 
proof 
using 
a TRAPEZOID 
was discovered 
by 
James 
Garfield 
(1876), 
later 
president 
of the 
United 
States, 
while 
serving 
in the 
House

(Pappas

An algebraic 
proof 
(which

by the Greeks) 
uses the EULER

Let the sides

legs of RIGHT

be aligned 
along 
the real and 
imaginary 
axes. Then

Multiplying

proceeds 
by similarity.

It is a property 
of RIGHT

is similar 
to the 
RIGHT

Because 
this

depends 
on proportions

IRRATIONAL NUMBERS and cannot 
be translated 
directly 
into 
a GEOMETRIC CONSTRUCTION, it was 
not

by Euclid.

A Pythagorean 
tripIe 
is a TRIPLE 
of POSITIVE INTE- 
GERS a, b, and 
c such that 
a RIGHT 
TRIANGLE 
exists 
with 
legs a,b 
and HYPOTENUSE 
C. 
By the PYTHAGO- 
REAN THEOREM, this 
is equivalent 
to finding 
POSITIVE 
INTEGERS a, b, and c satisfying 
a2+b2=c2. 
The 
smallest 
and 
best-known 
Pythagorean 
triple 
is 
(a, b, c) = (37 4 5). 
It is usual 
to consider 
only 
“reduced” 
(or “primitive”) 
solutions 
in which 
a and b are RELATIVELY PRIME, since 
other 
solutions 
can be generated 
trivially 
from the prim- 
itive 
ones. For primitive 
solutions, 
one of a or b must 
be 
EVEN, and the other 
ODD 
(Shanks 
1993, p. 141)) with 
c always ODD. In addition, 
in every 
primitive 
Pythag- 
orean 
triple, 
one side is always DIVMBLE 
by 3 and one 
by 5.

For any Pythagorean 
triple, 
the 
PRODUCT 
of the two 
nonhypotenuse 
LEGS 
(i.e., 
the two smaller 
numbers) 
is 
always 
DIVISIBLE 
by 12, and the PRODUCT 
of all three 
sides is DIVISIBLE 
by 60. 
It is not 
known 
if there 
are 
two distinct 
triples 
having 
the 
same 
PRODUCT. 
The 
existence 
of two such triples 
corresponds 
to a NONZERO 
solution 
to the DIOPHANTINE 
EQUATION 
2y(x4 - y”) = zw(z4 - w4)

(Guy 
1994, p. 188). 
Pythagoras 
and the Babylonians 
gave a formula

primitive) 
triples:

Considering 
twin triplets 
in which the LEGS are consecu- 
tive, a closed form is available 
for the rth such pair. 
Con- 
sider the general 
reduced 
solution 
(u2 - w2, 2212r, u2 +u2), 
then 
the requirement 
that 
the LEGS be consecutive

is 
u2 - u2 = 2uv*1. 
Rearranging 
gives 
( u-

(696, 697, 985), 
l . . (Sloane’s

LEG-HYPOTENUSE 
twin 
triples 
(u, b, c)

(v”

whenever 
( U-

that 
is to say when 
v = u + 1, in which

POTENUSE 
exceeds the EVEN 
LEG by unity 
and the twin 
triplet 
is given 
by (1+2u,2u(I+u), 
1+2u(l+u)). 
The 
number 
of leg-hypotenuse 
triplets 
with 
hypotenuse 
less 
than

given 
by 
A;(N)

(47) 
where

The 
first few LEG-

(7, 24,

There 
is a general 
method 
for obtaining 
triplets 
of Py- 
thagorean 
triangles 
with 
equal 
AREAS. 
Take 
the three

n2 
= 2rs + s2 
m3 
= T2 + 2rs

Then 
the 
RIGHT 
TRIANGLE 
generated 
by each

(Beiler

The only EXTREMUM 
of this 
function 
occurs 
at (T, s) = (0,O). 
Since 
A(T, s) = 0 for 
1” = 5, the smallest 
AREA 
shared 
by three 
nonprimitive 
RIGHT 
TRIANGLES 
is given 
by (T, s) = (1,2), 
which 
re- 
sults 
in an area of 840 and corresponds 
to the triplets 
(24, 70, 74), (40, 42, 58), and (15, 112, 113) (Beiler 
1966, 
p. 126). 
The 
smallest 
AREA 
shared 
by three 
primitive 
RIGHT 
TRIANGLES 
is 13123110, 
corresponding 
to the 
triples 
(4485, 
5852, 
7373), 
(1380, 
19019, 
19069), 
and 
(3059, 
8580, 9109) 
(Beiler 
1966, p. 127). 
One 
can also find 
quartets 
of RIGHT 
TRIANGLES 
with 
the same 
AREA. 
The 
QUARTET 
having 
smallest 
known 
area is (111, 6160, 6161), 
(231, 2960, 
2969), 
(518, 
1320,

(280,

with 
AREA 
341,880 
(Beiler 
1966, p* 127). 
Guy

gives additional 
information. 
It is also possible 
to find sets of three 
and four Pythago- 
rean triplets 
having 
the same 
PERIMETER 
(Beiler

In 1643, Fermat 
challenged 
Mersenne 
to find a Pythag-

triplet 
whose HYPOTENUSE

SUM of the LEGS 
were 
SQUARES. 
Fermat 
found 
the smallest 
such solu-

A related 
problem 
is to determine 
if a specified 
INTEGER 
IV can bethe 
AREA ofa RIGHT TRIANGLE with rational 
sides. 
1, 2,3, and 4 are not the AREAS 
of any RATIONAL- 
sided RIGHT TRIANGLES, 
but 
5 is (3/2, 
20/3, 
41/6), 
as 
is 6 (3, 4, 5). The 
solution 
to the problem 
involves 
the 
ELLIPTIC 
CURVE 
y2 = x3 - N2x. 
(63) 
A solution 
(a, b, c) exists if (63) has a RATIONAL solu-

Th ere is no known 
general 
method 
for 
determining 
if there 
is a solution 
for arbitrary 
N, but a 
technique 
devised 
by J. Tunnel1 
in 1983 allows 
certain 
values to be ruled 
out (Cipra

QR 
Decomposition 
Given 
a MATRIX A, its Q&decomposition 
is of the form 
A=QR, 
where R is an upper 
TRIANGULAR 
MATRIX 
and Q is an 
ORTHOGONAL MATRIX, 
i.e., one satisfying 
Q’Q = I, 
where 
1 is the 
IDENTITY 
MATRIX. 
This 
matrix 
decom- 
position 
can be used to solve linear 
systems 
of equations.

It is always possible 
to eliminate 
the xy cross term 
by a 
suitable 
ROTATION 
of the axes. To see this, 
consider

so 
x = x’ cos 8 + y’ sin 8

y = -x’ 
sin 8 + y’ cos 8

xy = -x’~ 
cos 8 sin 8 + x’y’ (cos2 8 - sin2 8)

Comparing 
the 
COEFFICIENTS 
with

tion 
of the form 
u’xf2 + 2b’x’y’

+ g’ = 0, 
(15) 
where the new COEFFICIENTS 
are 
U’ = am2

b’ = b(cos2 8 - sin2 8) + (a - c) sin8cos8

The cross term 
2b’x’y’ 
can therefore 
be made 
to vanish 
by setting 
b’ = b(cos2 8 - sin2 8) - (c - a) sin 8 cos 8 
= bcos(2e) 
- 
+(c

= 0. 
(22) 
For b’ to be zero, it must 
be true 
that 
cot(28)

(23) 
The other 
components 
are then 
given with the aid of the 
identity 
cos[cot-l(x)]

y’ = x sin cl: + y cos QI + b20x2 + bllxy

The map 
must 
have a DETERMINANT

to be 
AREA preserving, 
reducing 
the number 
of independent

from 
seven to three. 
The

can then 
be

by scaling 
and rotating 
to obtain 
x1 = xcosa

Recurrence 
N.B. 
A detailed 
on-line 
essay by S. Finch 
was the start- 
ing point 
for this 
entry. 
A quadratic 
recurrence 
is a RECURRENCE 
RELATION 
on 
a SEQUENCE 
of numbers 
{zn} 
expressing 
xn as a second 
degree 
polynomial 
in zk with 
k < n. For example, 
is a quadratic 
recurrence. 
Another 
simple 
example 
is 
x:n = 
(Xn-1)2 
(2) 
with 
x0 = 2, which 
has solution 
zn = 22”. 
Another 
ex- 
ample 
is the number 
of “strongly” 
binary 
trees of height 
5 n, given 
by 
yn = (y,-1)2 
+ 1 
(3)

Quadratic 
Residue 
If there 
is an INTEGER 
x such that 
x2 E 4 (mod 
PI 9 
(1) 
then 
Q is said to be a quadratic 
residue 
of x mod 
p. If 
not, 
Q is said to be a quadratic 
nonresidue 
of x mod 
p. 
For example, 
42 E 6 (mod 
lo), 
so 6 is a quadratic 
residue 
(mod 
10). 
The 
entire 
set of quadratic 
residues 
(mod 
10) are given 
by 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9, since 
1’ E 1 (mod 
10)

62 E 6 (mod

72 E 9 (mod 
10) 
g2 s 4 (mod

g2 E 1 (mod

making 
the numbers 
2, 3, 7, and 
8 the quadratic 
non- 
residues 
(mod

The 
use of multiple

Quadrature 
The 
word 
quadrature 
has 
(at least) 
three 
incompati- 
ble meanings. 
Integration 
by quadrature 
either 
means 
solving 
an INTEGRAL 
analytically 
(i.e., 
symbolically 
in 
terms 
of known 
functions), 
or solving 
of an integral 
numerically 
(e.g*, 
GAUSSIAN 
QUADRATURE, 
QUADRA- 
TURE 
FORMULAS). 
The 
word 
quadrature 
is also used 
to mean 
SQUARING: 
the construction 
of a square 
using 
only 
COMPASS 
and STRAIGHTEDGE 
which 
has the same 
AREA 
as a given 
geometric 
figure. 
If quadrature 
is pos- 
sible for a PLANE 
figure, 
it is said to be QUADRABLE. 
For a function 
tabulated 
at given 
values 
LC:~ (so the AB- 
SCISSAS cannot 
be chosen 
at will), 
write 
the function

Quadrilateral 
A 
D 
A four-sided 
POLYGON sometimes 
(but 
not very often) 
also known 
as a TETRAGON. If not explicitly 
stated, 
all 
four VERTICES 
are generally 
taken 
to lie in a PLANE. If 
the points 
do not 
lie in a PLANE, the 
quadrilateral 
is 
called 
a SKEW QUADRILATERAL. 
For 
a planar 
convex 
quadrilateral 
(left 
figure 
above), 
let 
the 
lengths 
of the 
sides 
be a, 
b, c, and 
d, the 
SEMIPERIMETER s, and 
the DIAGONALS p and g. The 
DIAGONALS are PERPENDICULAR IFF a2 +c2 = b2 +d2. 
An equation 
for the sum of the squares 
of side lengths 
is 
a2+b2+c2+d2 
=p2+q2+4x2, 
(1) 
where x is the length 
of the line joining 
the 
MIDPOINTS 
of the DIAGONALS. The AREA of a quadrilateral 
is given 
bY 
K = +pqsinB

where 
(4) 
is known 
as BRETSCHNEIDER'S FORMULA 
(Beyer 
1987). 
A special 
type 
of quadrilateral 
is the 
CYCLIC 
QUADRI- 
LATERAL, 
for which 
a CIRCLE can be circumscribed 
so 
that 
it touches 
each VERTEX. 
For BICENTRIC 
quadri- 
laterals, 
the CIRCUMCIRCLE and INCIRCLE 
satisfy 
2r2(R2 
- s”) = (R2 - s”>” - 4r2s2, 
(6) 
where R is the CIRCUMRADIUS, T in the INRADIUS, and 
s is the separation 
of centers. 
A quadrilateral 
with 
two 
sides PARALLEL 
is called 
a TRAPEZOID. 
There 
is a relationship 
between 
the 
six distances 
d12, 
d13, d14, 
d23, 
d24, and d34 between 
the four points 
of a 
quadrilateral

Quantization 
Efficiency 
Quantization 
is a nonlinear 
process 
which 
generates 
ad- 
ditional 
frequency 
components 
(Thompson 
et al. 1986). 
This 
means 
that 
the signal 
is no longer 
band-limited, 
so 
the SAMPLING 
THEOREM 
no longer 
holds. 
If a signal 
is 
sampled 
at the NYQUIST 
FREQUENCY, 
information 
will 
be lost. 
Therefore, 
sampling 
faster 
than 
the NYQUIST 
FREQUENCY 
results 
in detection 
of more 
of the signal 
and 
a lower 
signal-to-noise 
ratio 
[SNR]. 
Let 
/3 be the 
OVERSAMPLING 
ratio 
and define 
SNR,uant 
r/9 = SNRunquant 
l 
Then 
the following 
table 
gives values of ?jQ 
for a number 
of parameters. 
The 
Very Large 
Array 
of 27 radio 
telescopes 
in Socorro, 
New Mexico 
uses three-level 
quantization 
at p = 1, so 
VQ 
= 0.81.
