A Word From Roger Hodgson:
“The Logical Song was born from my questions about what really matters in life.
Throughout childhood we are taught all these ways to be and yet we are rarely told
anything about our true self. We are taught how to function outwardly, but not
guided to who we are inwardly. We go from the innocence and wonder of child-
hood to the confusion of adolescence that often ends in the cynicism and disillu-
sionment of adulthood. In The Logical Song, the burning question that came down
to its rawest place was ‘please tell me who I am.’ I think in these modern times, the
more complex life becomes, this eternal question becomes ever louder—which is
why the song continues to strike such a deep chord in people around the world.”

About the Book
From Google search to self-driving cars to human longevity, is Alphabet creating a
neoteric Garden of Eden or Bentham’s Panopticon? Will King Solomon’s challenge
supersede the Turing test for artiﬁcial intelligence? Can transhumanism mitigate
existential threats to humankind? These are some of the overarching questions in
this book, which explores the impact of information awareness on humanity starting
from the Book of Genesis to the Royal Library of Alexandria in the 3rd century BC
to the modern day of Google Search, IBM Watson, and Wolfram|Alpha.
The book also covers Search Engine Optimization, Google AdWords, Google
Maps, Google Local Search, and what every business leader must know about
digital transformation. “Search is curiosity, and that will never be done,” said
Google’s ﬁrst female engineer and Yahoo’s sixth CEO Marissa Mayer.
The truth is out there; we just need to know how to Google it!

Part I
The Gordian Knot
Hear him but reason in divinity,
And all-admiring with an inward wish
You would desire the king were made a prelate:
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
You would say it hath been all in all his study:
List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
A fearful battle render’d you in music:
Turn him to any cause of policy,
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,
Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,
The air, a charter’d libertine, is still.
—William Shakespeare, Henry V, Act 1 Scene 1

Chapter 1
To Google or Not to Google
Newton Lee
We are the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in
ofﬁces; the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers; of Google
and Facebook.
—Barack Obama
Prologue Google’s mission is “to organize the world’s information and to make it
universally accessible and useful” [1]. As of June 2016, Google has crawled and
indexed 60 trillion individual web pages [2], beﬁtting the search engine name that
was a play on the word “Googol” which means ten duotrigintillion, 10100, or 1
followed by a hundred zeros [3]. The Internet is accelerating collective con-
sciousness and revolutionizing economy, politics, and education, among others.
1.1
A Brief History of Time: From Research to Product
Google began in 1996 as a search engine called “BackRub” developed by Stanford
University grad students Sergey Brin and Larry Page in an academic research
project to estimate the importance of a website by checking its backlinks [4]. With
Craig Silverstein added to the team, the research project gained steam under faculty
guidance from Hector Garcia-Molina, Rajeev Motwani, Jeffrey D. Ullman, and
Terry Winograd [5]. The research funding was provided by National Science
Foundation (NSF), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and Interval Research
Corporation headed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Stanford University
consulting professor David Liddle.

In their 1998 paper “The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual Web search
engine,” Brin and Page presented a prototype of Google with 24 million web pages
indexed on the university server http://google.stanford.edu/. They introduced
PageRank (PR) as follows [6]:
We assume page A has pages T1…Tn which point to it (i.e., are citations). The parameter d
is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1. We usually set d to 0.85. Also C(A)
is deﬁned as the number of links going out of page A. The PageRank of a page A is given
as follows:
PR(A) = (1 −d) + d (PR(T1)/C(T1) ++ PR(Tn)/C(Tn))
Note that the PageRanks form a probability distribution over web pages, so the sum of all
web pages’ PageRanks will be one.
In September 1998, Google was incorporated in California near the height of the
dot-com bubble [7]. Although many Internet companies went belly up when the
bubble burst in the following years, ﬁnancial support for Google was unfaltering. In
a 2001 interview by BusinessWeek, Larry Page explained to technology reporter
Olga Kharif, “I think part of the reason we’re successful so far is that originally we
didn’t really want to start a business. We were doing research at Stanford
University. Google sort of came out of that. And we didn’t even intend to build a
search engine originally. We were just interested in the Web and interested in data
mining. And then we ended up with search technology that we realized was really
good. And we built the search engine. Then we told our friends about it and our
professors. Pretty soon, about 10,000 people a day were using it” [1].
A decade later in May 2011, Google had more than one billion unique monthly
visitors [8]. President Barack Obama touted the importance of federal funding for
innovative research and development in his 2011 State of the Union address:
“Thirty years ago, we couldn’t know that something called the Internet would lead
to an economic revolution. What we can do—what America does better than
anyone—is spark the creativity and imagination of our people. We are the nation
that put cars in driveways and computers in ofﬁces; the nation of Edison and the
Wright brothers; of Google and Facebook. In America, innovation doesn’t just
change our lives. It’s how we make a living” [9].
By August 2014, Google stock has risen 1294 % since it went public in 2004.
A Google search on “Google IPO” returns a Knowledge Graph with IPO price
information from Wall Street Journal (see Fig. 1.1). A Knowledge Graph is a
knowledge base used by Google to enhance its search engine’s search results with
semantic-search information gathered from a wide variety of sources (see Fig. 1.2).
In February 2016, Google surpassed Apple as the world’s most valuable com-
pany with a market capitalization of $531 billion [10]. A historical timeline on
Google is available online at:

Form Follows Function
The Google homepage (see Fig. 1.3) exempliﬁes the design principle of “form
follows function”—a phrase coined by American architect Louis Sullivan who
attributed the concept to Roman architect Marcus Vitruvius Pollio. Around 1490,
Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci drew the Vitruvian Man in pen and ink on
paper, accompanied by notes based on the work of Vitruvius (see Fig. 1.4).

Marissa Mayer, Google’s ﬁrst female engineer and Yahoo’s sixth CEO, was the
gatekeeper of Google’s homepage. She said, “It used to be people would come over
to my apartment and say, ‘Does your apartment look like Google or does Google
look like your apartment?’ I can’t articulate it anymore. I really love color. I’m not
very knick-knacky or cluttery. My place has very clean, simple lines. There are
some elements of fun and whimsy. That has always appealed to me” [11].
1.3
Google Doodles
The Google logo on the homepage is occasionally replaced for 24 hours by a
Google doodle to commemorate or celebrate notable people, events, and holidays.
The ﬁrst Google doodle was in honor of the Burning Man Festival [12]:
In 1998, before the company was even incorporated, the concept of the doodle was born
when Google founders Larry and Sergey played with the corporate logo to indicate their
attendance at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. They placed a stick ﬁgure
drawing behind the 2nd “o” in the word, Google, and the revised logo was intended as a
comical message to Google users that the founders were “out of ofﬁce.” While the ﬁrst
doodle was relatively simple, the idea of decorating the company logo to celebrate notable
events was born.
The ﬁrst animated doodle appeared on January 4, 2010 showing an apple fall
from a tree to pay tribute to Isaac Newton on his 367th birthday (see Fig. 1.5) [13].
The ﬁrst interactive doodle game debuted on May 21, 2010 to celebrate Pac-Man’s

30th anniversary (see Fig. 1.6) [14]. Apart from its own curation, Google invites the
general public to submit new doodle ideas to proposals@google.com. In addition,
Google holds annual “Doodle 4 Google” competitions to “encourage eligible U.S.
school students and their parents/guardians on their behalf to use their creativity to
create their own interpretation of the Google logo” [15].

Jennifer Hom, a long-time Google doodler, spoke to Emma Barnett of The
Telegraph about the process of creating a doodle: “I draw mostly on the computer.
I usually draw the thumbnail of the doodle on a sketchbook by hand and then take a
photo of it on my phone and email it to myself so I can draw over the outline on
Photoshop. Occasionally I will draw the entire doodle by hand. For example, when
we celebrated the life of the Austrian artist, Gustav Klimt, [by camouﬂaging the
word Google into his iconic painting ‘The Kiss’] I did paint the idea out using gold
leaf and everything” [16].

Of the Google doodles honoring notable people, female activist group SPARK
Movement criticized Google for under representing women: “Google Doodles may
seem light-hearted, especially when they’re accompanied by quirky games and
animation, but the reality is that these doodles have emerged as a new manifestation
of who we value as a society—a sign of who ‘matters.’ Just like statues, stamps, and
national holidays, you know that if someone is featured on Google’s homepage,
they’ve done something important.” Ryan Germick, Doodle Team Lead, replied,
“Women have historically been underrepresented in almost all ﬁelds: science,
school curricula, business, politics—and, sadly, doodles. We’ve been working to ﬁx
the imbalance in our doodles. … So far this year we’ve done doodles for as many
women as men, a big shift from ﬁgures below 20 % in past years” [17].
1.4
I’m Feeling Lucky
As serious as a Google search might be, the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button adjacent to
the “Google Search” button elicits the human side of Google. “It’s possible to
become too dry, too corporate, too much about making money,” Marissa Mayer
explained. “I think what’s delightful about ‘I’m Feeling Lucky’ is that it reminds
you there are real people here” [18].
In 2007, an estimated 1 % of all Google searches went through the “I’m Feeling
Lucky” button. However, Google Instant has rendered the feeling lucky button
practically unusable since 2010. Although you can’t have your cake and eat it too,
one can click on the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button without entering a keyword. As of
June 2016, the lucky button would randomly take you to:
1. I’m Feeling Artistic—Art Project at Google Cultural Institute [19]
2. I’m Feeling Curious—a Google a day [20]
3. I’m Feeling Doodley—Google Doodles [21]
4. I’m Feeling Generous—Google One Today [22]
5. I’m Feeling Hungry—Local restaurants search results [23]
6. I’m Feeling Playful—Google Doodles [21]
7. I’m Feeling Puzzled—a Google a day [20]
8. I’m Feeling Stellar—Google Earth (Hubble Telescope) [24]
9. I’m Feeling Trendy—Google Trends [25]
10. I’m Feeling Wonderful—World Wonders at Google Cultural Institute [26].
Danny Sullivan, founding editor of Search Engine Land, visited Googleplex (see
Fig. 1.7) in August 2007 and took notice of the wall art near one of the
mini-kitchens (see Fig. 1.8). Designed by Joe Sriver, Fig. 1.9 is Larry Page on a
box of Larryos with the tagline “Searching for delicious nutrition? Forget Google,
eat. … Larryos” and Fig. 1.10 is Sergey Brin on a box of Raisin Brin.

In the 2013 comedy ﬁlm The Internship shot on location at Googleplex, Nike
Campbell (Owen Wilson) had a heart-to-heart conversation with Dana (Rose
Byrne) [27]:
Nick Campbell: You know, Google has single-handedly cut into my ability to bullshit.
Dana: Cramping your style?
Nick Campbell: Big time.
Dana: Make you a better person?
Nick Campbell: Yeah, true. 90 % Google, 10 % you.
1.5
Have Fun and Keep Googling
“Google” as a transitive verb began in July 1998 when Larry Page wrote “Have fun and
keep googling!” in his email to the Google-Friends subscribers (see Fig. 1.11) [28].
In October 2002, the verb “google” ﬁrst appeared on American television in
season 7, episode 4 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The title of the episode was
coincidentally and appropriately named “Help.” Willow (Alyson Hannigan), Buffy
(Sarah Michelle Gellar), and Xander (Nicholas Brendon) were discussing their
fellow student Cassie (Azura Skye) in their high school [29]:
Willow: [to Buffy] Have you Googled her yet?
Xander: Willow! She’s 17!
Willow: It’s a search engine.

In 2006, the Oxford English Dictionary and the eleventh edition of the
Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary added “Google” as a verb in their
“deﬁnitive record of the English language,” joining the ranks of pop-culture cachet
like FedEx, TiVo, and Xerox [30].
In 2014, The New York Times portrayed the current generation “an era of
Googled deﬁnitions” in its interview with the new chief of the Oxford English
Dictionary (O.E.D.): “For the ﬁrst time in 20 years, the venerable dictionary has a
new chief editor, Michael Profﬁtt, who assumes the responsibility of retaining the
vaunted traditions while ensuring relevance in an era of Googled deﬁnitions and
text talk. … Mr. Profﬁtt advocates links in digitized literature to O.E.D. entries; he
wants more use by students, whose distinction between ‘dictionary’ and ‘web
search’ is increasingly blurred” [31].
In 2016, Google assistant was introduced at the annual Google I/O developer’s
conference. “It’s not enough to give them links,” said Google CEO Sundar Pichai.
“We really need to help them get things done in the real world. This is why we’re

evolving search to be more assistive” [32]. Google assistant enables conversational
speech in human-computer interface, which is being used in voice-activated Google
Home, messaging app Allo, and video calling application Duo [33].
Since the airing of “Help” in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, “Google” as a transitive
verb has become popular in mainstream media and everyday usage. The following
is one memorable dialogue between real estate magnate Donald Trump and U.S
Senator Marco Rubio from Florida at the televised CNN-Telemundo Republican
debate in Houston on February 25, 2016 [34]:
Trump: You haven’t hired one person, you liar.
Rubio: He hired workers from Poland. And he had to pay a million dollars or so in a
judgment from.
Trump: That’s wrong. That’s wrong. Totally wrong.
Rubio: That’s a fact. People can look it up. I’m sure people are Googling it right now.
Look it up. “Trump Polish workers,” you’ll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers
on one of his projects. He did it.
(Applause)
Indeed, there was a 700 % spike in Google searches for “Polish workers” after
the ﬁery exchange between Trump and Rubio. “Polish workers was on no one’s
radar but during those times that Rubio brought it up it piqued everyone’s interest to
know more and this is what they started searching for,” said LaToya Drake, mar-
keting manager and media outreach at Google [35].

Gatekeeper of Information
Google cofounder Larry Page said, “Basically, our goal is to organize the world’s
information and to make it universally accessible and useful. That’s our mission”
[1]. As of June 2016, Google has crawled and indexed 60 trillion individual web
pages [2], beﬁtting the search engine name that was a play on the word “Googol”
which means ten duotrigintillion, 10100, or 1 followed by a hundred zeros [3].
With the ever-changing search algorithm, Google ranks the results using more
than 200 factors including PageRank, site quality, trustworthiness, and freshness. In
a typical year, Google makes over 500 search improvements that are determined by:
1. Precision Evaluation—Human evaluators at Google run more than 40,000
precision evaluations per year to rate the usefulness of individual results for a
given search input.
2. Side-by-Side Experiment—Evaluators compare two sets of search results from
the old algorithm and the new algorithm before launching the search update.
Google conducts over 9,000 side-by-side experiments annually.
14
N. Lee

3. Live Trafﬁc Experiment—Google changes search algorithm for a small per-
centage of real Google users and analyzes their search behaviors. About 7,000
live trafﬁc experiments are performed each year.
The Google search results are displayed in a multitude of formats:
1. Knowledge Graphs—Semantic-search information gathered from a wide variety
of sources including a database of real world people, places, things, and the
connections among them (see Fig. 1.12).
2. Snippets—Small previews of information such as a web page’s title and short
descriptive text for each search result.
3. News—Results from online newspapers and blogs.
4. Answers—Immediate answers and information for popular queries such as
weather, sports scores, quick facts, and numeric computations including cur-
rency exchange.
5. Videos—Video-based
results
with
thumbnails
from
YouTube,
Vimeo,
Dailymotion, and others.
6. Images—Image-based results with thumbnails.
7. Reﬁnements—“Advanced Search,” related searches, and other search tools to
help Google users ﬁne-tune their search results.
Google has become the de facto gatekeeper of information available on the
Internet. Starting in December 2009, Google personalizes individual’s search
results based on the history of what they have clicked on. Consequently, Google
displays more of what the users want to see and less of what they do not care about.
To address the danger of creating information silos, Google keeps some search
results similar between users. “We want diversity of results,” said Google product
manager Johanna Wright. “This is something we talk about a lot internally and
believe in. We want there to be variety of sources and opinions in the Google
results. We want them in personalized search to be skewed to the user, but we don’t
want that to mean the rest of the web is unavailable to them” [36].

mization (SEO) in the age of digital transformation (what every business leader
must know) in Chapter 4 of this book. Frank Buddenbrock, Google AdWords

Censorship of Information
In the ﬁght against PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) and Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA)
in 2012, Google added a black “censored” bar atop its logo as well as a link “Tell
Congress: Please don’t censor the web!” to the Google Public Policy Blog that said,
“You might notice many of your favorite websites look different today. Wikipedia
is down. WordPress is dark. We’re censoring our homepage logo and asking you to
petition Congress. So what’s the big deal? Right now in Washington D.C.,
Congress is considering two bills that would censor the web and impose burden-
some regulations on American businesses. They’re known as the PROTECT IP Act
(PIPA) in the Senate and the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in the House. …
Fighting online piracy is extremely important. We are investing a lot of time and
money in that ﬁght. … Because we think there’s a good way forward that doesn’t
cause collateral damage to the web, we’re joining Wikipedia, Twitter, Tumblr,
Reddit, Mozilla and other Internet companies in speaking out against SOPA and
PIPA” [37].
On the other side of the coin, Cary H. Sherman, CEO of the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA) that represents music labels, criticized the blackout
tactic in The New York Times: “Wikipedia, Google and others manufactured con-
troversy by unfairly equating SOPA with censorship. … The hyperbolic mistruths,
presented on the home pages of some of the world’s most popular Web sites,
amounted to an abuse of trust and a misuse of power. … The violation of neutrality
is a patent hypocrisy. … What the Google and Wikipedia blackout showed is that
it’s the platforms that exercise the real power. Get enough of them to espouse
Silicon Valley’s perspective, and tens of millions of Americans will get a one-sided
view of whatever the issue may be, drowning out the other side” [38].
With great power comes great responsibility. Dr. Robert Epstein, senior research
psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology,
warns about subtle new forms of Internet inﬂuence are putting democracy at risk
worldwide in Chapter 9 of this book.
When the 2012 Google Transparency Report showed an alarming rise in gov-
ernment censorship around the world, Google’s senior policy analyst Dorothy Chou
wrote, “We’ve been asked to take down political speech. It’s alarming not only
because free expression is at risk, but because some of these requests come from
countries you might not suspect—Western democracies not typically associated with
censorship” [39]. The democratic countries include Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland,
Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States
[40]. Figure 1.13 shows the number of content removal requests from courts and
government agencies around the world between 2009 and 2015 [41].
Unlike Western democracies, communist China made very few content removal
requests to Google. Instead, China opts for preemptive measures by severely
censoring search results from Google. In March 2010 when Google ceased ﬁltering
1

its search results in China [42], the search giant had to scale back operations in
China and redirect users from Google.cn to its uncensored Google.com.hk in Hong
Kong [43].
1.8
Information Warfare and Connecting the Dots
At the 2014 DEF CON 22 conference in Las Vegas, American author Richard Thieme
recalled a conversation with his friend from the National Security Agency (NSA) who
spoke of the difﬁculty in knowing the truth: “You know enough to know what’s not
true, but you can’t necessarily connect all of the dots to know what is true” [44].
Sometimes the answers are hiding in plain sight. A eureka moment came to
Archimedes when he connected the dots between the ordinary routine of taking a bath
and the scientiﬁc pursuit of determining the volume of an irregularly shaped object.
In the Academy Award-winning documentary Citizenfour (2014), former
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee and NSA whistleblower Edward
Snowden told journalists Glenn Greenwald, Ewen MacAskill, and Laura Poitras
[45, 46]:
Any analyst, at any time, can target anyone; any selector, anywhere. Where those com-
munications will be picked up depends on the range of the sensor networks, and the
authorities that that analyst is empowered with. Not all analysts have the ability to target
everything, but I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone, from
you or your accountant, to a federal judge, to even the President, if I had a personal email.
Fig. 1.13 Removal requests by the numbers (from courts and government agencies around the
world to remove information from Google products)

Snowden’s revelation may come as a shock to the average American citizens, but
certainly not to most foreign governments. Total information awareness has helped
to stabilize relations among international powers, and to that end espionage is
making the world a safer place. Interestingly and perhaps by pure coincidence, the
English name “Snowden” (snow + hill) is uncannily related to the Russian name
“Mopoзoв” (Morozov) which means “frost” or “freeze.” Пaвлик Mopoзoв (Pavlik
Morozov) was a 13-year-old patriot or traitor, depending on one’s point of view.
According to an investigation by the House Oversight Committee in February
2016, the U.S. government may have used compromised software for up to 3 years.
Cybersecurity researchers believe that foreign hackers may have repurposed an
encryption backdoor created by the NSA to conduct their own cyber snooping [47].
In other words, foreign spies may have been eavesdropping on mobile phone calls,
Skype chats, emails, and other means of communication by U.S. residents for years.
An estimated 100,000 foreign spies are currently living and working in the U.S.,
according to Chris Simmons, a retired counterintelligence supervisor for the U.S.
Defense Intelligence Agency.
The issue of counterintelligence came up during my meeting with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on November 27, 2015. To my surprise, the FBI was
not overly concerned with foreign spies on U.S. soil. In fact, the FBI may decide to
leave a suspected mole undisturbed for years in order to feed him false critical
information at an opportune moment or to use him to catch a bigger ﬁsh. “We have
our spies in their country too,” said an FBI agent with a contented smile. Total
information awareness should be a two-way street. Otherwise, secrecy and
manipulation make things worse by clouding the truth and impairing people’s
judgment. For example:
• U.S. government: More than 50 intelligence ofﬁcers ﬁled complaints with the
Pentagon in 2015 that their reports on ISIS and al Qaeda in Syria were inap-
propriately altered by senior ofﬁcials for political reasons. One defense ofﬁcial
told The Daily Beast that “the cancer was within the senior level of the intel-
ligence command” [48].
• News media: In a controversial cover story in the October 2015 issue of The
New York Times Magazine, reporter Jonathan Mahler opined that it was “im-
possible to know what was true and what wasn’t” about the saga of the hunt for
Osama bin Laden and his death in Pakistan. The ofﬁcial bin Laden story, he
said, was “ﬂoating somewhere between fact and mythology” [49]. It quickly
sparked rebuttals from Washington Post national security reporter Greg Miller,
CNN analyst Peter Bergen [50], and Black Hawk Down author Mark Bowden,
who all accused Mahler of elevating unsubstantiated conspiracy theories [51].
• Hollywood: During the height of the Cold War in 1954, the CIA secretly funded
the ﬁlm version of George Orwell’s Animal Farm as propaganda against
communism and Joseph Stalin [52]. Leni Riefenstahl’s award-winning Triumph
of the Will in 1935 helped the rise of Nazism in Germany. And D. W. Grifﬁth’s
The Birth of a Nation in 1915 was partly responsible for the resurrection of Ku
Klux Klan in Georgia.

• Education: A world geography textbook published by McGraw-Hill called
African slaves “workers” in the section titled “Patterns of Immigration”: “The
Atlantic Slave Trade between the 1500 s and 1800 s brought millions of
workers from Africa to the southern United States to work on agricultural
plantations.” After a school kid’s mother openly complained on Facebook, the
publisher agreed to revise the text, stating that “we will update this caption to
describe the arrival of African slaves in the U.S. as a forced migration and
emphasize that their work was done as slave labor” [53].
• Social media: During the escalated Gaza-Israel conﬂict in November 2012,
Israeli Defense Force (IDF) live tweeted its military campaign in the Gaza strip
during the weeklong Operation Pillar of Defense [54]. In response, Hamas
tweeted its own account of the war along with photographs of casualties [55].
Both sides hoped to use social media to win world sympathy and shift political
opinion to their sides [56]. Aylin Manduric, international presidential fellow at
the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress (CSPC) in Washington,
D.C., examines the use of social media as a tool for information warfare in
Chapter 10 of this book.
• Television: Amid the crisis in the Ukraine, Russia and the European Union in
2015 unleashed a new bout of information warfare to sway public opinions.
Russia increased its spending on RT (Russia Today) television network whereas
the BBC planned to launch a new Russian satellite TV and video service [57].
• The Internet: In the aftermath of losing the bitter ﬁght on Stop Online Piracy
Act (SOPA) and Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA), CEO Cary H.
Sherman of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) wrote an
opinion piece in The New York Times: “Misinformation may be a dirty trick, but
it works. Consider, for example, the claim that SOPA and PIPA were ‘cen-
sorship,’ a loaded and inﬂammatory term designed to evoke images of crack-
downs on pro-democracy Web sites by China or Iran. … Wikipedia, Google and
others
manufactured
controversy
by
unfairly
equating
SOPA
with
censorship. They also argued misleadingly that the bills would have required
Web sites to ‘monitor’ what their users upload…” [38].
In fact, the Internet is a haven for information warfare because search engines do
not differentiate between authoritative and crowd-sourced knowledge, truth and
fabrication, information and disinformation, or free speech and hate speech [58].
Google bomb and Googlewashing are common practices of manipulating search
results for the purpose of making a political statement. The best known Google
bombs are “miserable failure” leading to President George W. Bush and “Rick
Santorum” to a sexually explicit deﬁnition. Accused fraudster Wayne Simmons
fooled the U.S. Department of Defense into issuing him a security clearance as
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Allison Barber remarked that “there is quite
a bit of info under ‘Wayne Simmons and CIA’ on a Google search” [59]. Google’s
Jigsaw program https://jigsaw.google.com/ uses the Redirect Method to target
aspiring ISIS recruits. Yasmin Green, Jigsaw’s head of research and development
explained, “The Redirect Method is at its heart a targeted advertising campaign:
20

Let’s take these individuals who are vulnerable to ISIS’ recruitment messaging and
instead show them information that refutes it.”
The Wolfram|Alpha search engine addresses the problem of misinformation and
disinformation on the Internet by using the curation work of library professionals
and domain experts to answer user queries. “Wolfram is far more computational,”
said Amit Singhal, former Head of Google Search. In Chapter 11 of this book,
John B. Cassel from Wolfram Research describes in details the Wolfram|Alpha
computational knowledge “search” engine. In Chapter 12, Barret Havens and
Jennifer Rosenfeld at Woodbury University discuss seamless access to libraries
from Alexandria through the digital age. In Chapter 13, Frances Eames Noland of
the University of Oxford talks about privileged and corporatization of information.
And in Chapter 14, futurist Tiana Sinclair discourses on communication and lan-
guage in the age of digital transformation.

Information Silos and Prison of Ideas
At TEDGlobal 2009, Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie said, “The
single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they
are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only
story. … Our lives and our cultures are composed of many overlapping stories, and
if we hear only a single story about another person or country, we risk a critical
misunderstanding” [60].
Antonin Scalia was the longest-serving U.S. Supreme Court Justice appointed by
President Ronald Reagan in 1986. In a 2013 interview with New York Magazine,
Scalia said that he ditched The Washington Post and The New York Times because
they just “went too far for me. I couldn’t handle it anymore. It was the treatment of
Fig. 1.14 Google Search on “information silo” returns a Knowledge Graph deﬁnition from
Investopedia. In our metaphor, the information management system represents our brain, and the

21

almost any conservative issue. It was slanted and often nasty. And, you know, why
should I get upset every morning? I don’t think I’m the only one” [61]. Scalia was
certainly not the only one. Too many people prefer to stay inside their own comfort
zones with a one-sided liberal or conservative sentiment, creating their own
information silos (see Fig. 1.14). When people refuse to see how things look from
another point of view, their silo mentality has fueled arguments in families, disputes
with neighbors, bigotry between races, and conﬂicts among nations.
In spite of the polar opposite opinions on same-sex marriage, all-male admis-
sions policy, and other issues dividing conservatives and liberals, Justice Scalia had
a long and close friendship with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the U.S. Supreme
Court [62]. In December 2012, Jesuit priest and peace activist John Dear went to
Kabul to meet the Afghan Peace Volunteers, a diverse community of students ages
15 to 27 who practice peace and nonviolence [63]. “I used to detest other ethnic
groups,” one of the youths told Dear, “but now I’m trying to overcome hate and
prejudice. You international friends give me hope and strength to do this.” Another
youth added, “I used to put people in categories and couldn’t drink tea with anyone.
Now I’m learning that we are all part of one human family. Now I can drink tea
with anyone” [64].
The tug of war between creationists and evolutionists is most evident in biology
textbooks for high school students. In Russian schools where Darwinism prevails, a
schoolgirl named Maria Schreiber from St. Petersburg asked the court in 2006 to
replace an evolutionist biology textbook with an “Orthodox” version [65]. In a
widely publicized live debate moderated by CNN journalist Tom Foreman in
February 2014, Christian author Ken Ham and educator Bill Nye (“the Science
Guy”) presented their opposing answers to the question “Is creation a viable model
of origins in today’s modern, scientiﬁc era?” [66] Although no one has perfect
answers and impartial views, we should allow debates to shape and reshape our
opinions. If scientists had not challenged the status quo, we would not have enjoyed
modern medicine and technological innovations today. Albert Einstein quipped that
“everyone sits in the prison of his own ideas; he must burst it open” [67]. Although
we may not have the complete knowledge or we may be bombarded with contra-
dictory information, we can still make informed decisions based on wisdom and the
knowledge of good and evil.
1.10
Knowledge of Good and Evil
Knowledge in and of itself is devoid of good and evil. Knowledge, however, does
not necessarily make human beings wiser. Cognitive psychologist Tom Stafford at
the University of Shefﬁeld has cautioned that “the Internet can give us the illusion
of knowledge, making us think we are smarter than we really are” [68]. In fact,
knowledge without wisdom can be outright dangerous. King Solomon lamented
that “for with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more
grief” (Ecclesiastes 1:18). In 1965, Encyclopaedia Britannica ran an ad in The
22
N. Lee

Atlantic Monthly: “A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. So is a lot. The more
you know, the more you need to know—as Albert Einstein, for one, might have
told you. Great knowledge has a way of bringing with it great responsibility” [69].
First discovered by Friedrich Miescher in 1869, DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is
a molecule that carries most of the genetic instructions used in the development,
functioning, and reproduction of all known living organisms [70]. In 2010 when
new genomics data showed that all humans except for sub-Saharan Africans carry a
small percentage of Neanderthal DNA [71], some racists started spinning the idea
of racial superiority due to the presence of Neanderthal DNA in modern Europeans
and Asians [72].
Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence equation E = mc2 was used to create
weapons of mass destruction before its peacetime application in nuclear power
plants [73]. In August 1939, Albert Einstein wrote to President Franklin D.
Roosevelt to warn him about the possibility of the Nazis building an atomic bomb;
and the Manhattan Project was subsequently born in 1941. “Woe is me,” said
Einstein upon hearing the news of the Hiroshima bombing (see Fig. 1.15). “Had I
known that the Germans would not succeed in developing an atomic bomb, I would
have done nothing” [74].

Einstein’s regret is reminiscent of Apple CEO Tim Cook’s reason for refusing to
comply with the court order to bypass the iOS security on a terrorist’s iPhone:
“Speciﬁcally, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating
system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an
iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software—
which does not exist today—would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in
someone’s physical possession” [75]. Corporate spying and international espionage
are always a grave concern, but who is to say that no one else besides Apple can
hack the iOS, and no country besides the United States can create an atomic bomb?
Indeed, the FBI cracked the terrorist’s iPhone without Apple’s help in less than
2 months [76], and nine countries—Russia, the United States, France, China, the
United Kingdom, Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea—possess nuclear
weapons today [77].
It seems that evil oftentimes accompanies good in every scientiﬁc discovery or
engineering marvel. For instance, nuclear power for electrical energy and weapons
of mass destruction, GPS for navigating automobiles and guided missiles, and
genetically-modiﬁed viruses for vaccines and bioweapons, just to name a few.
Christian evangelist Billy Graham spoke about technology and faith at TED in
February 1998: “You’ve seen people take beneﬁcial technological advances, such
as the Internet … and twist them into something corrupting. You’ve seen brilliant
people devise computer viruses that bring down whole systems. The Oklahoma
City bombing was simple technology, horribly used. The problem is not technol-
ogy. The problem is the person or persons using it” [78].
To encourage the use of technology for good instead of evil, dynamite inventor
Alfred Nobel wrote his last will in 1895 to the establishment of the Nobel Prize to
honor “men and women from all corners of the globe for outstanding achievements
in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and for work in peace”
[79].
Charlie Chaplin gave an impassioned speech in The Great Dictator (1940): “The
aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these
inventions cries out for the goodness in man, cries out for universal brotherhood, for
the unity of us all. … Let us ﬁght for a world of reason, a world where science and
progress will lead to all men’s happiness” [80].
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists issued a warning in its January 2016
newsletter: “The challenge remains whether societies can develop and apply
powerful technologies for our welfare without also bringing about our own
destruction through misapplication, madness, or accident” [81].
Circumstances can magnify both good and evil. War and destruction have taken
a toll on many brilliant scientists. J. Robert Oppenheimer, head of the Manhattan
Project, expressed his fear that the bomb might become “a weapon of genocide”
[82]. In a 1965 television broadcast, Oppenheimer said in tears and agony (see
Fig. 1.16), “We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed.
A few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu
scripture, the Bhagavad Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should
do his duty, and to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, ‘Now I am
24
N. Lee

become Death, the destroyer of worlds.’ I suppose we all thought that, one way or
another” [83].
1.11
Google’s Mantra: Don’t Be Evil
Google is the ﬁrst and only company in history that has a “Don’t be evil” manifesto
written in their IPO letter (S-1 Registration Statement) [55, 84]:
Don’t be evil. We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served—as
shareholders and in all other ways—by a company that does good things for the world even
if we forgo some short term gains. This is an important aspect of our culture and is broadly
shared within the company.
Whatever “evil” is or is not, Google’s IPO statement seems to deﬁne evil as the
failure to do “good things for the world.”
The common theme between Google and world religions is faith, that is, com-
plete trust or conﬁdence. In the IPO letter, Page and Brin proudly proclaimed that
“Google users trust our systems”:
Google users trust our systems to help them with important decisions: medical, ﬁnancial
and many others. Our search results are the best we know how to produce. They are

scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, in his 1965 televised speech

unbiased and objective, and we do not accept payment for them or for inclusion or more
frequent updating. We also display advertising, which we work hard to make relevant, and
we label it clearly. This is similar to a well-run newspaper, where the advertisements are
clear and the articles are not inﬂuenced by the advertisers’ payments. We believe it is
important for everyone to have access to the best information and research, not only to the
information people pay for you to see.
In a hilarious 2013 interview by NPR host Peter Sagal, Google’s ﬁrst CEO Eric
Schmidt admitted that he thought the Google slogan “Don’t be evil” was stupid but
then he was surprised by how well it had worked [85]:
Well, it was invented by Larry and Sergey. And the idea was that we don’t quite know what
evil is, but if we have a rule that says don’t be evil, then employees can say, I think that’s
evil. Now, when I showed up, I thought this was the stupidest rule ever, because there’s no
book about evil except maybe, you know, the Bible or something.
So what happens is, I’m sitting in this meeting, and we’re having this debate about an
advertising product. And one of the engineers pounds his ﬁsts on the table and says, that’s
evil. And then the whole conversation stops, everyone goes into conniptions, and even-
tually we stopped the project. So it did work.
In his 2014 book How Google Works coauthored with Jonathan Rosenberg,
Schmidt wrote, “Yes, it genuinely expresses a company value and aspiration that is
deeply felt by employees. But ‘Don’t be evil’ is mainly another way to empower
employees. … Googlers do regularly check their moral compass when making
decisions” [86].
“In a certain sense, Google is being held to a higher standard,” said Jon Fox of
the California Public Interest Research Group (CALPIRG). “When Facebook does
really nasty things, people are like, ‘Oh well, it’s Facebook, what can you expect
from them?’ But as Google is maturing, they are running up against that problem
more and more of not doing evil” [87].
Over the years, some observers have questioned Google’s practice of choosing
business imperatives over social values amid a string of privacy concerns and
violations. Eric Schmidt had vigorously defended the search giant by asserting that
“there has to be a trade-off between privacy concerns and functionality” without
belying the corporate motto “Don’t be evil” [88].
In August 2005, CNET reporter Elinor Mills published some personal infor-
mation of Eric Schmidt through Google searches. She wrote, “Like so many other
Google users, his virtual life has been meticulously recorded. The fear, of course, is
that hackers, zealous government investigators, or even a Google insider who falls
short of the company’s ethics standards could abuse that information. Google, some
worry, is amassing a tempting record of personal information, and the onus is on the
Mountain View, Calif., company to keep that information under wraps” [89].
In retaliation for publicizing Schmidt’s personal information, Google blacklisted
all CNET reporters for a year [90], which was an irony because in an interview by
CNBC’s “Inside the Mind of Google” in December 2009, Schmidt famously said
that “If you have something that you don’t want anyone to know, maybe you
shouldn’t be doing it in the ﬁrst place” [91].

In a January 2010 Town Hall meeting at Apple headquarters, Steve Jobs bla-
tantly told his employees that he thought Google’s “Don’t be evil” mantra “bull-
shit” or “a load of crap” [92].
In May 2010, Google made a stunning admission that for over 3 years, its
camera-toting Street View cars had inadvertently collected snippets of private
information that people send over unencrypted WiFi networks [93] (see Fig. 1.17).
In October 2010, Google also admitted to accidentally collecting and storing
entire e-mails, URLs, and passwords from unsecured WiFi networks with its Street
View cars in more than 30 countries, including the United States, Canada, Mexico,
some of Europe, and parts of Asia [94].
At the 2012 Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas, Jennifer Granick,
director of civil liberties at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society,
asked the audience of security professionals who they trusted less, Google or the
government? The majority raised their hands for Google. “I fear Google more than I
pretty much fear the government,” said panelist Jeff Moss, founder of Black Hat
and DEF CON. “Google, I’m contractually agreeing to give them all my data” [95].
Indeed, one can download his or her entire Google search history from https://
history.google.com/history/ including search strings, timestamps, geolocation
coordinates, and accessed URLs.
In the October 2013 issue of The Atlantic, Georgia Tech professor Ian Bogost
opined that “as both users of its products and citizens of the world it increasingly

inﬂuences and alters, we would be wise to see Google’s concern for evil as a
pragmatic matter rather than an ethical one. … through its motto Google has
effectively redeﬁned evil as a matter of unserviceability in general, and unser-
viceability among corporatized information services in particular. … The company
doesn’t need to exercise any moral judgment other than whatever it will have done.
The biggest risk—the greatest evil—lies in failing to engineer an effective imple-
mentation of its own vision. Don’t be evil is the Silicon Valley version of Be true to
yourself. It is both tautology and narcissism” [96].
In August 2014, technology analyst Rob Enderle complained that Google
“didn’t understand the difference between good and evil. I think they should change
their slogan to ‘evil are us.’ It seems like every time you turn around they are doing
something that is at best questionable and at worst anti-people” [97].
In December 2015, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) ﬁled a complaint
with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that for millions of K-12 students using
Chromebooks, “Google is engaged in collecting, maintaining, using, and sharing
student personal information in violation of the ‘K-12 School Service Provider
Pledge to Safeguard Student Privacy’ (Student Privacy Pledge), of which it is a
signatory” [98]. However, Jonathan Rochelle, Director of Google Apps for
Education (GAFE), replied that GAFE, Chrome Sync, and other Google products
and services comply with both the law and the Student Privacy Pledge [99].

Google for Education
Realizing the importance of computer technology in early education, Apple laun-
ched a program called Kids Can’t Wait (KCW) in 1983 to donate an Apple IIe
computer in each of the 9,250 elementary and secondary schools in California
[100]. Fast forward to the January 2016 State of the Union address, President
Barack Obama said, “In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by
providing Pre-K for all and offering every student the hands-on computer science
and math classes that make them job-ready on day one. We should recruit and
support more great teachers for our kids” [101].
U.S. Chief Technology Ofﬁcer Megan Smith elaborated, “Computer Science for
All is the President’s bold new initiative to empower all American students from
kindergarten through high school to learn computer science and be equipped with
the computational thinking skills they need to be creators in the digital economy,
not just consumers, and to be active citizens in our technology-driven world. Our
economy is rapidly shifting, and both educators and business leaders are increas-
ingly recognizing that computer science (CS) is a ‘new basic’ skill necessary for
economic opportunity and social mobility” [102].
Like Apple in its early days, Google is a champion of education. As of 2016,
there are 50 million users of Google Apps for Education. 10 million students and
teachers are using Google Classroom in 190 countries. Google also offers intern-
ships, student scholarships, and a host of educational programs including [103]:

The Closing of the American Mind
Computer science education, however, is not the be-all and end-all. It should not
come at the expense of other school subjects. In February 2016, Florida Senate
approved a bill allowing high school students to count computer coding as a foreign
language course. The NAACP’s Florida Conference and Miami-Dade branch, the
Florida chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), and the
Spanish American League Against Discrimination (SALAD) disapproved of the
legislation: “Our children need skills in both technology and in foreign languages to
compete in today’s global economy. However, to deﬁne coding and computer
science as a foreign language is a misleading and mischievous misnomer that
deceives our students, jeopardizes their eligibility to admission to universities, and
will result in many losing out on the foreign language skills they desperately need
even for entry-level jobs in South Florida” [104].
It is all too easy to not see the forest for the trees. I once played a question card
game with my college friends. I chose a card in random and the question was:
“What would be your ﬁrst order of business if you were elected President of the
United States?” I answered, “Improve the educational system.” A few years later in
1987, University of Chicago Professor Allan Bloom published the seminal book
The Closing of the American Mind in which he described how “higher education
has failed democracy and impoverished the souls of today’s students” [105].

In 2011, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel paid 24 kids $100,000 each to drop out of
college to become entrepreneurs [106]. Larry Page and Sergey Brin suspended their
Ph.D. studies to commercialize Google [107] [108]. Bill Gates and Mark
Zuckerberg left Harvard University in their sophomore year to start Microsoft and
Facebook respectively [109, 110]. What gives?
Formal education is supposed to nurture students into their full potential, but
something is amiss. Since the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, the division
of labor has brought forth specialization in the workforce and university curricu-
lums. For instance, in 1749, Academy of Philadelphia (predecessor to the
University of Pennsylvania) was organized into three schools: the English School,
the Mathematics School, and the Latin School [111]. By 2016, the Ivy League
university has 12 schools and more than 100 majors of study [112].
Standardized tests and rote learning are churning out human workforce.
Meanwhile, IBM Watson has won Jeopardy! in 2011 [113], and robots are dis-
placing as many as 5 million human workers by 2020 [114]. Highly skilled workers
are not immune either. In 2015, Google, Adobe, and MIT researchers at the
Computer Science and Artiﬁcial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have created
“Helium”—a computer program that modiﬁes codes faster and better than expert
computer engineers for complex software such as Photoshop [115]. What takes
human coders months to program, Helium can do the job in a matter of hours or
even minutes. Similarly, computers can outperform human physicians in diagnos-
ing patients and recommending treatments [116].
“I have been in medical education for 40 years and we’re still a very
memory-based curriculum,” said Columbia University professor Herbert Chase.
“The power of Watson-like tools will cause us to reconsider what it is we want
students to do” [113]. Long before IBM Watson’s wake up call, Pink Floyd’s 1979
song “Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2” has nailed down the problem: “We don’t
need no education. We don’t need no thought control. No dark sarcasm in the
classroom. Teachers leave them kids alone. … All in all you’re just another brick in
the wall” [117].
We do need education, just not the one-size-ﬁts-all education. Albert Einstein
did not talk until he was four years old. Chinese-American author Yiyun Li wrote
about early education for her son who was slow to start speaking: “I had been
worrying more about Vincent not graduating from the programme than his real
speech development. Is this something that all parents have to face in the modern
world—that our children have to meet more and more standards, otherwise either
we, the parents, the children themselves, or perhaps both, are considered by pro-
fessionals to be failing?” [118]
Why have very few of child prodigies achieved adult eminence after graduating
from universities? [119] Ted Kaczynski, commonly known as the Unabomber, is an
infamous tragedy. Kaczynski was a child prodigy who entered Harvard University
at the age of 16, earned a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, and became an
assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley [120]. Despite his
academic success, he became disillusioned with modern society and technology.
The cookie-cutter education system has failed both genius kids and special-needs
30
N. Lee

children. Status quo stiﬂes creativity. A case in point: A National Geographic logic
puzzle featured in Brain Games has found that 80 % of children under 10 gave the
correct answer in less than 10 seconds whereas the majority of adults were left
clueless [121].
In February 2016, cybersecurity expert John McAfee wrote in an op-ed article
that “a room full of Stanford computer science graduates cannot compete with a
true hacker without even a high-school education” [122]. That may be true, but
cybercriminals are generally less educated than ethical hackers. For instance,
Spanish police with support of INTERPOL arrested a 16-year-old girl for alleged
cyber attacks [123], and security ﬁrm AVG linked a piece of malware to an
11-year-old boy in Canada [124].
“The Logical Song” by Roger Hodgson (Supertramp) in 1979 asked some
pointed questions that still resonate with many young people today: “When I was
young, it seemed that life was so wonderful… But then they sent me away to teach
me how to be sensible… Please tell me what we’ve learned. I know it sounds
absurd, but please tell me who I am. Now watch what you say or they’ll be calling
you a radical, liberal, fanatical, criminal” [125].
Luckily, we can turn to Albert Einstein for answers. Speaking at TED confer-
ence in February 1998, Rev. Billy Graham said, “Albert Einstein—I was just
talking to someone, when I was speaking at Princeton, and I met Mr. Einstein. He
didn’t have a doctor’s degree, because he said nobody was qualiﬁed to give him
one” [78]. Joking aside, Einstein’s view on college education is apparent in his
autobiography and letters to American inventor Thomas Edison and African-
American philosopher Robert Thornton:
1. Disagreeing with Thomas Edison’s idea that education should be directed
toward learning facts, Einstein wrote to Edison in May 1921, “It is not so very
important for a person to learn facts. For that he does not really need a college.
He can learn them from books. The value of an education in a liberal arts college
is not the learning of many facts, but the training of the mind to think something
that cannot be learned from textbooks” [126].
2. Supporting Robert Thornton in his efforts to introduce “as much of the phi-
losophy of science as possible” into the modern physics curriculum at the
University of Puerto Rico, Einstein wrote to Thornton in December 1944, “I
fully agree with you about the signiﬁcance and educational value of method-
ology as well as history and philosophy of science. So many people today—and
even professional scientists—seem to me like somebody who has seen thou-
sands of trees but has never seen a forest. A knowledge of the historic and
philosophical background gives that kind of independence from prejudices of
his generation from which most scientists are suffering. This independence
created by philosophical insight is—in my opinion—the mark of distinction
between a mere artisan or specialist and a real seeker after truth” [127].
3. Einstein wrote in his autobiography, “All religions, arts and sciences are
branches of the same tree. All these aspirations are directed toward ennobling
man’s life, lifting it from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the
1

31

individual towards freedom. It is no mere chance that our older universities
developed from clerical schools. Both churches and universities—insofar as
they live up to their true function—serve the ennoblement of the individual.
They seek to fulﬁll this great task by spreading moral and cultural under-
standing, renouncing the use of brute force. The essential unity of ecclesiastical
and secular institutions was lost during the 19th century, to the point of
senseless hostility. Yet there was never any doubt as to the striving for culture.
No one doubted the sacredness of the goal. It was the approach that was dis-
puted” [128].

The Opening of the American Mind
A popular YouTube video titled “Top 10 Worst Teachers” garnered over 3 million
views in a matter of 6 months. One of the top comments was posted by
“TheRealSugarBitzSkelly (後輩),” a 14-year-old girl who is an aspiring author,
artist, and animator. She wrote, “I hate school. Teachers are so mean. 6th/7th/8th
grade girls are the worst sluts ever. Boys are just stupid.. Well, so are girls.. And,
my education is horrible! I would like to go to a school with lots of nice kids and
teachers, and get the best education” [129]. In one of the replies, a “Bob Larry”
responded, “gotta say it.. most of what you learn in school won’t apply to your life
later. All it does is open up opportunities that need the different subjects but not
others. for instance i’m going into programming. history, science, and a lot of the
stuff they teach in english courses doesn’t really apply to what I need to know to
learn the career path i’m following.”
Teachers, not students, are the ones who are failing. As Albert Einstein said that
“all religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree,” the detachment of
philosophy—the forefather of all knowledge and academic disciplines—from
mathematics, sciences, and technology is the fundamental reason for failure in
modern-day K-12 and higher education.
Education needs a major overhaul. The closing of the American mind is not only
an American problem but a global issue. The world needs more good teachers who
can inspire. As William Arthur Ward said, “The mediocre teacher tells. The good
teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires”
[130]. Duke University Prof. Kalman Bland said at a faculty roundtable about Allan
Bloom: “He sees the university as an institution in society, and the function of the
university in society as going against the grain. That’s the good part of the book—
showing that the university does ﬁt into the social context, and that it deﬁnes itself
in relationship to the needs and values of that context. And the book asks us to take
a close look at whether or not we’re serving the powers that be or whether we’re
being the gadﬂies—the Socratic model of shaking our students up and liberating
them from their popular biases” [131].

We also need better methodologies and technologies to assist in teaching and
learning. In Chapter 15 of this book, Sandra Lund-Diaz, Mireia Montane, and
Penelope

from
Knowledge

offer
the
key
to
knowledge-building pedagogy success in supporting paradigm shifts for student
growth and the 4Cs (Critical thinking, Collaboration, Communication, Creativity)
of future education. In Chapter 16, Zach Tolan of the Polymathic Prodigy Institute
introduces educational ergonomics and the future of the mind. In Chapter 17, Lewis
Watson from Marshall Fundamental School provides an answer to the math
problem. And in Chapter 18, Andrew Donaldson of the Bolder Super School
describes XQ Super Schools and online achievement.
The STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) pro-
gram is a good example of integrating multiple disciplines in the classroom to teach
students to think critically. The arts include drawing, ﬁlmmaking, music, and
photography that have been greatly empowered by computing and electronics
technology [132, 133]. The arts also encompass cooking, dance, literature, and
other creative expressions. John Keating (Robin Williams) lectured his students in
Dead Poets Society (1989): “We don’t read and write poetry because it’s cute. We
read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human
race is ﬁlled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are
noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love,
these are what we stay alive for” [134].
Pragmatism over idealism, the percentage of undergraduates majoring in ﬁelds
like English or philosophy has fallen by more than 50 % since 1970 [135]. The
proportion of Stanford students majoring in the Humanities has plummeted from
over 20 % to only 7 % in 2015 [136]. In an attempt to “breach the silos of students’
lives,” Stanford University created two new joint-major programs known as CS+X
that allows students to study English and computer science or music and computer
science [137]. Under the “One University” policy, University of Pennsylvania
allows undergraduates access to courses at most of Penn’s undergraduate and
graduate schools [138]. Still, some people have opted for homeschooling or
unorthodox educational institutions:
1. Academy Award winning director Laura Poitras attended Sudbury Valley
School where there were no grades, no classrooms, and no division of students
by age [139]. The school’s cofounders Mimsy Sadofsky and Daniel Greenberg
explained, “Students of all ages determine what they will do, as well as when,
how, and where they will do it. … The fundamental premises of the school are
simple: that all people are curious by nature; that the most efﬁcient, long-lasting,
and profound learning takes place when started and pursued by the learner; that
all people are creative if they are allowed to develop their unique talents; that
age-mixing among students promotes growth in all members of the group; and
that freedom is essential to the development of personal responsibility” [140].
2. Cofounded by Peter Diamandis (XPRIZE Foundation) and Ray Kurzweil
(Google), Singularity University at the NASA Research Park offers educational

inter-cultural principles” in order to “educate, inspire and empower leaders to
apply exponential technologies to address humanity’s grand challenges” [141].
The corporate founders are Genentech, Autodesk, Google, Cisco, Ewing Marion
Kauffman Foundation, Nokia, and ePlanet Capital. “If I were a student, this is
where I’d want to be,” said Larry Page [142].
To realize the urgent need for education reform, American journalist George
Packer succinctly summed up the perils of the current dysfunctional education
system in the November 2011 issue of The New Yorker [143]:
Thiel believes that education is the next bubble in the U.S. economy. He has compared
university administrators to subprime-mortgage brokers, and called debt-saddled graduates
the last indentured workers in the developed world, unable to free themselves even through
bankruptcy. Nowhere is the blind complacency of the establishment more evident than in
its bovine attitude toward academic degrees: as long as my child goes to the right schools,
upward mobility will continue. A university education has become a very expensive
insurance policy—proof, Thiel argues, that true innovation has stalled. In the midst of
economic stagnation, education has become a status game, “purely positional and extre-
mely decoupled” from the question of its beneﬁt to the individual and society.

Internet Revolution and Collective Consciousness
Since the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century,
mass media has ushered in a new era of collective consciousness—a set of shared
beliefs, ideas, and moral attitudes that operate as a unifying force within society.
Notwithstanding the danger of assimilation akin to the Borg in Star Trek (see
Fig. 1.18 Google search on “The Borg” displays a Wikipedia deﬁnition of the ﬁctional alien race
in the Star Trek franchise as “a collection of species that have been turned into cybernetic
organisms functioning as drones in a hive mind.”
34
N. Lee

Fig. 1.18), the Internet is accelerating collective consciousness and revolutionizing
economy, politics, and education, among others:
1. New Industrial Revolution—Micha Kaufman, cofounder and CEO of Fiverr.
com, published an article in the Forbes magazine titled “The Internet Revolution
is the New Industrial Revolution.” He wrote, “As we engage in a century where
everyone is not only a global citizen, but a valuable ‘Brand in Waiting,’ we
begin to understand that the Internet Revolution IS in fact the Industrial
Revolution of our time. It’s a sweeping social disruption that brings with it not
only new inventions and scientiﬁc advances, but perhaps most importantly
revolutionizes both the methods of work and we the workers ourselves” [144].
2. New Political Revolution—Social media has played a vital role in Arab Spring
uprisings including the 2011 Egyptian revolution
[145]. Activists organized
through Facebook and Twitter the nationwide protests on January 28, 2011 to
call for an end to President Hosni Mubarak’s government [146]. Mubarak
reacted by shutting down 88 % of the Egyptian Internet and 9 out of 10 Internet
Service Providers (ISPs) [147]. Google responded to the Internet blockade by
working with Twitter and SayNow to unveil a web-free speak-to-tweet service
(Speak2Tweet), allowing anyone to send and receive tweets by calling a phone
number [148]. In November 2012, more than 90 % of the Internet access in
Syria was shut down by the government in an attempt to limit the dissemination
of images and videos taken by the opposition activists [149]. Google again
offered the Speak2Tweet service in Syria [150]. Prof. Yousri Marzouki and
Olivier Oullier at Aix-Marseille University called the phenomenon “Virtual
Collective Consciousness” [151].
3. New Educational Revolution—At the TED2013 conference, educational
researcher Sugata Mitra talked about how poor children in an Indian slum were
able to teach themselves English, along with advanced concepts in biology,
chemistry, and mathematics, simply by following their own curiosity and
helping each other with the use of a single personal computer and access to the
Internet [152]. Mitra’s vision is to build Self-Organized Learning Environments
(SOLEs) in the School of Clouds, and to create the future of learning with a
curriculum of “big questions.” For example, Mitra said, “The way you would
put it to a nine-year-old is to say, ‘If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth,
how would you ﬁgure out if it was going to or not?’ And if he says, ‘Well,
what? how?’ you say, ‘There’s a magic word. It’s called the tangent of an
angle,’ and leave him alone. He’ll ﬁgure it out. … I’ve tried incredible,
incredible questions—‘When did the world begin? How will it end?’—to
nine-year-olds. This one is about what happens to the air we breathe. This is
done by children without the help of any teacher. The teacher only raises the
question, and then stands back and admires the answer.”
In the foreseeable future, a poor child in a remote corner of the world will be able
to create a killer app, solve the P versus NP problem [153], formulate the Theory of
1
To Google or Not to Google
35

Everything [154], and ﬁnd a cure to cancer and other diseases—all without formal
education. The Internet is the teacher.
1.16
Alphabet Slogan: Do the Right Thing
Parents often tell their children, “Don’t do this” or “Don’t do that.” For a mature
grown-up, however, the annoying “Don’t” becomes “Do” as in “Do the right
thing.” In the 2015 corporate restructuring, Google’s newly-created parent company
Alphabet does not dwell on “don’t be evil” anymore but instead adopts a code of
conduct that entreats employees to “do the right thing” [155]:
Employees of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and controlled afﬁliates (“Alphabet”) should do
the right thing—follow the law, act honorably, and treat each other with respect.
We rely on one another’s good judgment to uphold a high standard of integrity for our-
selves and our company. We expect all Board members and employees to be guided by
both the letter and the spirit of this Code.
A Google spokesman told The Wall Street Journal, “Individual Alphabet
companies may of course have their own codes to ensure they continue to promote
compliance and great values. But if they start bringing cats to work, there’s gonna
be trouble with a capital T” [156].
Humorous aside, “Don’t be evil” and “Do the right thing” basically mean the
same thing to Google cofounder Sergey Brin. In a 2004 Playboy interview, Brin
explained [84]:
As for “Don’t be evil,” we have tried to deﬁne precisely what it means to be a force for
good—always do the right, ethical thing. Ultimately, “Don’t be evil” seems the easiest way
to summarize it. It’s not enough not to be evil. We also actively try to be good.
We deal with all varieties of information. Somebody’s always upset no matter what we do.
We have to make a decision; otherwise there’s a never-ending debate. Some issues are
crystal clear. When they’re less clear and opinions differ, sometimes we have to break a tie.
For example, we don’t accept ads for hard liquor, but we accept ads for wine. It’s just a
personal preference. We don’t allow gun ads, and the gun lobby got upset about that. We
don’t try to put our sense of ethics into the search results, but we do when it comes to
advertising.
I think we do a good job of deciding. As I said, we believe that “Don’t be evil” is only half
of it. There’s a “Be good” rule also. We have Google grants that give advertising to
nonproﬁt organizations. A couple hundred nonproﬁts—ranging from the environment to
health to education to preventing various kinds of abuse by governments—receive free
advertising on Google.

Philanthropy
Google.org, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Ford Foundation are some of
the largest and most well-known philanthropic organizations in the world. In
December 2015, Mark Zuckerberg announced that he would donate 99 % of his
Facebook shares worth $45 billion to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, LLC for
charitable projects [157]. In fact, there are more than 1.5 million charitable orga-
nizations in the United States spending over $1.57 trillion in cash and 7.9 billion
hours of service to “do the right thing” by lending a helping hand [158].
Back in 1949, the Ford Foundation thoroughly reviewed the ideas and goals of
philanthropy, and came to the following conclusions on why and how to spend half
a billion dollars a year for charity [159]:
At one time the gifts of individuals and benevolent organizations were intended largely to
relieve the suffering of “the weak, the poor and the unfortunate.” With the establishment of
the modern foundation a much greater concept came into being. The aim is no longer
merely to treat symptoms … but rather to eradicate the causes of suffering. Nor is the
modern foundation content to concern itself only with man’s obvious physical needs; it
seeks rather to help man achieve his entire well-being—to satisfy his mental, emotional,
and spiritual needs as well … what he needs and wants, what incentives are necessary to his
productive and socially useful life, what factors inﬂuence his development and behavior,
how he learns and communicates with other persons, and, ﬁnally, what prevents him from
living at peace with himself and his fellow men.
The Apollo 11 Moon landing on July 20, 1969 was made possible because of the
unprecedented national focus, collaborative spirit, and ﬁnancial support for one
tremendously difﬁcult challenge. Imagine what $1.57 trillion in cash and 7.9 billion
hours of service could have done to solve some of the most pressing issues today.
We may not achieve an immediate unalloyed success without a few bumps along
the way, but the successful Moon landing was preceded by many failures.
1.18
Moon Landing and a Little Help from My Friends
President John F. Kennedy spoke at Rice University on September 12, 1962: “We
choose to go to the moon in this decade … not because they are easy, but because
they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our
energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one
we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win” [160].
America at the time intended to win the Space Race against Russia who laun-
ched the ﬁrst satellite (Sputnik) in October 1957 (see Fig. 1.19) and sent the ﬁrst
astronaut (Yuri Gagarin) to outer space in April 1961 (see Fig. 1.20).
Moon landing was a huge challenge that was solved by human perseverance and
ingenuity, in spite of the mere 50 % chance of success according to American
astronaut Neil Armstrong [161]. Imagine what else we can accomplish if America

and the whole world is determined to eradicate wars, diseases, pollutions, global
warming, poverty, homelessness, world hunger, and other human sufferings.
Scientists and engineers need unfaltering support akin to what NASA received in
the 60’s from the U.S. government and the American public. An older generation
may feel nostalgic about the 1967 Beatles song With a Little Help from My Friends
or the Joe Cocker’s version that he performed with Jimmy Page and others at
Woodstock in 1969. The Beatles song was played as the wake-up music on Space
Shuttle Mission STS-61 on December 5, 1993 [162].
A little help from federal funding can go a long way. DARPA initiated and
funded the research and development of Advanced Research Projects Agency

Network (ARPANET) that went online in 1969 [163]. The success of ARPANET
gave rise to the global commercial Internet in the mid-1990s and the new generation
of Fortune 500 companies today including Amazon.com, Google, eBay, and
Facebook. Another good example is the talking, question-answering Siri applica-
tion on Apple’s iPhone [164]. Siri originated from a DARPA-funded project known
as PAL (Personalized Assistant that Learns)—an adaptive artiﬁcial intelligence
program for data retrieval and synthesis [165].
President Barack Obama said at a campaign fundraiser in April 2012: “I believe
in investing in basic research and science because I understand that all these
extraordinary companies … many of them would have never been there; Google,

Facebook would not exist, had it not been for investments that we made as a
country in basic science and research” [166].
In a testimony before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee on May 11, 2016,
Robert D. Atkinson of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation
(ITIF) said, “It is no longer enough to simply fund scientiﬁc and engineering
research and hope it somehow produces commercial results. Federal R&D funding
as a share of GDP is lower today than before the Russians launched Sputnik. This
means the nation needs to be much more efﬁcient about transferring discoveries into
commercial applications. Otherwise, we risk slowing the pace of innovation even
more. … Improving the efﬁciency of the scientiﬁc and engineering research system
can provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts at a lower budgetary impact than increasing funding
without improving the efﬁciency. But continuing to underfund research while also
not improving the efﬁciency of the system … is a recipe for underperformance. And
to be clear doing both is ideal: more federal funding for R&D and a better com-
mercialization and tech transfer system” [167].
In the 1983 ﬁlm The Right Stuff adapted from 1979 book of the same name by
Tom Wolfe, seven Mercury astronauts discussed their spacecraft [168]:
Gordon Cooper (Dennis Quaid): You boys know what makes this bird go up? Funding
makes this bird go up.
Gus Grissom (Fred Ward): He’s right. No bucks, no Buck Rogers.

Faith in God and Trust in Google
Given that the ﬁrst manned Moon landing only had a 50 % chance of landing safely
on the moon’s surface, it was indeed an exemplary faith in technology and human
spirit (see Fig. 1.21). American astronaut Neil Armstrong said in a 2012 video
interview, “I thought we had a 90 % chance of getting back safely to Earth on that
ﬂight but only a 50–50 chance of making a landing on that ﬁrst attempt. There are
so many unknowns on that descent from lunar orbit down to the surface that had not
been demonstrated yet by testing and there was a big chance that there was
something in there we didn’t understand properly and we had to abort and come
back to Earth without landing” [161].
When Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were about to land on the moon, they dis-
agreed with the on-board computer’s decision to put them down on the side of a
large crater with steep slopes littered with huge boulders. “Not a good place to land
at all,” said Armstrong. “I took it over manually and ﬂew it like a helicopter out to
the west direction, took it to a smoother area without so many rocks and found a
level area and was able to get it down there before we ran out of fuel. There was
something like 20 seconds of fuel left.” The rest is history as Armstrong uttered his
famous line, “One small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.”
Faith is deﬁned as complete trust or conﬁdence in someone or something. The
Bible, the Quran, and Google all require faith from the great mass of the world
population in order to thrive:
The Bible: “Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this
mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for
you.” (Matthew 17:20)
The Quran: “If Allah is your helper none can overcome you, and if He withdraws His help
from you, who is there who can help you after Him? In Allah let believers put their trust.”
(Quran 3:160)
Google: “Google users trust our systems to help them with important decisions: medical,
ﬁnancial and many others.” (Google founders’ 2004 IPO Letter) [84, 169].
Sometimes Google is the only source of life-and-death information. In December
2013, 27-year-old Sanaz Nezami with severe head injuries was rushed to Marquette
General Hospital in Michigan. “At the time the staff did not know anything about
this young woman who came in with critical injuries,” said nurse supervisor Gail
Brandly [170]. The nurse Googled the patient’s name and found a resume online
with her picture and a phone number through which the hospital was able to reach
her relatives in Iran [171]. In May 2016, Maritha Strydom in Brisbane, Australia
had been following her daughter Maria’s progress on climbing Mount Everest
through a series of satellite pings from Maria’s phone. “I was worried when the
pings stopped, and we started calling but no one could give us any answers,”
Strydom told CNN in an interview. “So my other daughter, also lives in Brisbane,
just before bedtime Googled and found in the Himalayan Times that my daughter
had passed away” [172].

Indeed, Google ranked number 2 in the world’s most reputable companies in
2015 according to Reputation Institute’s Global RepTrak survey on innovation,
governance, citizenship, and other factors [173] (see Fig. 1.22). More people trust
search engines for their news than traditional media, online-only media, and social
media [174] (see Fig. 1.23). In the 2016 Edelman Trust Barometer report, a survey
of 33,000 people across 28 countries has afﬁrmed that 63 % of respondents trust
search engines for news and information, comparing to 58 % for traditional media
and 53 % for online-only media [175].
Speaking at a small technology dinner at the Aspen Institute, executive chairman
of Alphabet Inc. Eric Schmidt said, “There’s a particular religion that we all rep-
resent, and it goes something like this: ‘if you take a large number of people and

Institute’s Global RepTrak 100

you empower them with communication tools and opportunities to be creative,
society gets better.’ … The combination of empowerment, innovation, and cre-
ativity will be our solution, but that is a religion in-of-itself” [176]. Chapter 2 of this
book unravels the Gordian knot of religious, moral, and political entanglement.
Google Life Sciences, formerly a division of Google X, was renamed to Verily
in December 2015 as a subsidiary of Alphabet [177]. The 13th century Middle
English “verily” fell out of common use except in the King James Bible. “I can’t
think of another association for Verily but the Bible,” said Greg Balla, creative
director at the branding and naming agency Zenmark. “The challenge for them is to
try to move away from the heavy-handed quality attached to Verily from associ-
ation with the scripture—due to everything that’s happening in our world right now.
But if they can deliver on the promise, ‘you can trust what we are doing,’ then it ﬁts
perfectly” [177]. Chapter 3 of this book offers some scientiﬁc insights into Google
vs. Death.
Verily, trust Google. The truth is out there; we just need to know how to Google
it!

know-it-all reputation of Google Search, cognitive psychologist Tom Stafford has
cautioned that “the Internet can give us the illusion of knowledge, making us think
we are smarter than we really are” [2]. Is it possible to unravel the Gordian knot of
religious, moral, and political entanglement?

Book of Genesis and Theory of Relativity
“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” is the ﬁrst verse in the
Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh) and the Christian Old Testament
(see Fig. 2.1) [3]. Similarly, the Quran proclaims that “Surely your Lord is none
other than Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days.” (Surah
Al-A’raf 7:54) [4].
Whether the 6-day creation story is a fable or the truth alluding to time dilation
in Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity (see Fig. 2.2), the Bible and the Quran—
sharing the same root as an Abrahamic religion—are undoubtedly amongst the

most profound and inﬂuential books ever written. The best known Abrahamic
religions are Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and the Bahá’í Faith (see Fig. 2.3).
Boston University professor emeritus Peter Berger sums up elegantly in his article
on Abrahamic faiths: “There is also common ground, I think, between morally
decent people of all faiths or no faith. That common ground is humanity. Jews,
Christians and Muslims, the children of Abraham, believe that this humanity is part
of the creation by the one God whom they worship” [5].
In April 2015, Pew Research Center reported that 31 and 23 % of the 7 billion
world population are Christians and Muslims respectively [6]. In other words, the
Bible and the Quran have touched the lives of almost 4 billion living souls
worldwide among people of all ages, genders, educational levels, and socioeco-
nomic status, regardless of whether they are devoted or hypocritical, conservative or
liberal.

Thanks to the Internet and search engines, the full text of the Bible and the
Quran are now at our ﬁngertips. Long gone are the days when the Catholic priests
discouraged the believers from reading the Bible on their own for fear that they
would misinterpret the Scriptures. Former Google quantitative analyst Seth
Stephens-Davidowitz disclosed that the number of Google searches questioning
God’s existence went up in the ﬁrst half of this decade [7]. Albert Einstein
acknowledged a very mysterious pantheistic God: “I see a pattern, but my imagi-
nation cannot picture the maker of that pattern. I see a clock, but I cannot envision
the clockmaker. The human mind is unable to conceive of the four dimensions, so
how can it conceive of a God, before whom a thousand years and a thousand
dimensions are as one?” [8].

Information War and the Blame Game
Information war started in the very beginning of human history when the serpent
half-deceived Eve by telling her, “You will not certainly die, for God knows that
when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing
good and evil” (Genesis 3:4–5). So Adam and Eve both ate the forbidden fruit, and
they were overcome by shame and fear:
Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the
garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the
garden. But the LORD God called to the man, “Where are you?” He answered, “I heard you
in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.” And he said, “Who told you
that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”
(Genesis 3:8–11)
The omniscient and omnipresent God asked Adam, “Where are you?” without
exercising his omnipotence. Adam and Eve were free, living in the Garden of Eden.
Instead of owning up to one’s mistakes, humanity set in motion the acrimonious
blame game that is prevalent throughout human history:
The man said, “The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree,
and I ate it.” Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” The
woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”
(Genesis 3:12–13)
The man blamed the woman, and the woman accused the serpent. An ancient
Chinese proverb says that 牛不飲水, 不能按牛頭低(you cannot push a cow’s
head down to drink water). In other words, we all act according to our free will in
spite of temptations and circumstances. It is easier to point ﬁngers than to accept
responsibilities. People complain about elected ofﬁcials but they do not care to vote.
They criticize some multinational corporations but their banks and 401K are
proﬁting from the stocks of those companies. A modern-day serpent is anyone who
disseminates misinformation and disinformation in their verisimilitude.
The Book of Job in the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament tells a
story of a righteous man whose name is Job. One day, God allowed Satan to test
Job by destroying all his properties and killing all ten of his children. Instead of
being angry at God, Job said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I
will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the
LORD be praised” (Job 1:21). The next day, God permitted Satan to afﬂict Job with
painful sores from head to toe. Job’s wife said to him, “Are you still maintaining
your integrity? Curse God and die!” But he replied, “Shall we accept good from
God, and not trouble?” (Job 2:10).
Job’s ordeal calls into question the dichotomy of blessing and suffering, good and
evil, and the role of God and Satan in humanity. Why would God bother to entertain
Satan’s suggestions about killing Job’s ten innocent children? Could it be that the
biblical author was trying to portray two sides of the same coin similar to yin and
yang in Chinese philosophy? Must good and evil coexist in the universe like Jekyll

and Hyde Captain Kirk in the 1966 Star Trek episode “The Enemy Within”? Is there
a cosmic balance between creation and destruction as evident from 100 billion stars
being born and dying each year [9]?
Despite the lack of complete answers, Job accused neither God nor Satan, not
himself or other people—a rare quality for a millionaire who had lost everything,
and a far cry from the rich who committed murder-suicide over ﬁnancial ruin [10].
Job refused to play the blame game, acknowledging and accepting that life is not
fair. “We cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand,” said
Prof. Randy Pausch in his “Last Lecture” at Carnegie Mellon University [11].
2.3
Inﬁnite Diversity in Inﬁnite Combinations
Notwithstanding Thomas Jefferson’s proclamation that “all men are created equal” in
the 1776 U.S. Declaration of Independence (see Fig. 2.4), all men and women are not
created equal in the literal sense unless we all share identical DNA. But even identical
twins with the same DNA develop different ﬁngerprints when the growing fetuses
touch the amniotic sac in their mother’s womb. The twins can become two very
different people due to upbringing, social, economic, and environmental factors.
Because these external factors can vary greatly from person to person, life cannot be
fair. However, unfairness builds character and brings diversity to the otherwise
homogeneous and isotropic existence. Who wants to live in a world where everybody
looks identical, thinks alike, and acts the same? Nature has shown us that there are at
least 9,956 species of birds on earth (see Fig. 2.5) and 30,000 species of ﬁsh in the
oceans (see Fig. 2.6) according to Google search results. Diversity emanates beauty.
Even though all complex organisms are preprogrammed by their DNAs, they
can exhibit individuality within the conﬁnes of nature. Mahatma Gandhi once said
that “no two leaves are alike” [12]. Human DNA consists of about 3 billion bases,
and more than 99 % of those bases are the same in all people [13]. Yet, each person
is a unique manifestation of God. The commonality that unites all human beings is
that we are created in the image of God: “So God created mankind in his own
image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.”
(Genesis 1:27). However, the image of God is not singular, but plural: “The LORD
God said, ‘The man has now become like one of us…’” (Genesis 3:22). One God,
multiple manifestations—in both the spiritual realm and the physical world—just as
Albert Einstein wrote about the wave-particle duality of light: “It seems as though
we must use sometimes the one theory and sometimes the other, while at times we
may use either. We are faced with a new kind of difﬁculty. We have two contra-
dictory pictures of reality; separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena
of light, but together they do” [14].
In January 2016, Spike Lee and Jada Pinkett Smith called for Oscar boycott
because “for the 2nd consecutive year all 20 contenders under the actor category are
white” [15]. American actress Stacey Dash dismissed the outrage over Oscars: “I
think it’s ludicrous. We have to make up our minds. Either we want to have
58

segregation or integration, and if we don’t want segregation, then we have to get rid
of channels like BETBlack Entertainment Television and the BET Awards and the
Image Awards, where you’re only awarded if you’re black. If it were the other way
around, we’d be up in arms. It’s a double standard. There shouldn’t be a Black
History Month. We’re Americans, period” [16]. A decade prior in December 2005,
Oscar winner Morgan Freeman had also argued for abolishing Black History Month
in an interview on CBS’ 60 min: “Black History is American history. … I’m going

to stop calling you a white man. And I’m going to ask you to stop calling me a
black man. I know you as Mike Wallace, you know me as Morgan Freeman” [17].
On one hand, it is great to be inclusive without discrimination or prejudice. On
the other hand, it is wonderful to celebrate diversity and uniqueness. Otherwise,
where should we draw the line after getting rid of Black History Month? What
about National Hispanic Heritage Month, Asian-Paciﬁc American Heritage Month,
Women’s History Month, LGBT Pride Month, and many others that serve to raise
awareness of diverse contributions to society? Instead of abolishing them, we
should add a new Human Heritage Month to remind the world that we are human
beings and not some savage animals.

Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry said, “If man is to survive, he will have
learned to take a delight in the essential differences between men and between
cultures. He will learn that differences in ideas and attitudes are a delight, part of
life’s exciting variety, not something to fear” [18]. In the Star Trek episode “Is
There in Truth No Beauty?” (1968), Roddenberry and writer Jean Lisette Aroeste
introduced the notion of IDIC (Inﬁnite Diversity in Inﬁnite Combinations) [19]:
Dr. Miranda Jones (Diana Muldaur): [regarding the Vulcan IDIC] I understand, Mr.
Spock. The glory of creation is in its inﬁnite diversity.
Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy): And the ways our differences combine, to create meaning
and beauty.
Mr. Spock is admired by Trekkies for his Vulcan logic and superior intelligence.
In the 1987 seminal book The Society of Mind, MIT Prof. Emeritus Marvin Minsky
described human intelligence as a result of diverse processes: “What magical trick
makes us intelligent? The trick is that there is no trick. The power of intelligence
stems from our vast diversity, not from any single, perfect principle” [20]. A few
musical notes can morph into countless new songs, and a small set of vocabulary
can create a congeries of poems. Inﬁnite diversity in inﬁnite combinations.

Questioning One’s Religion
“We’re long on search,” said Marissa Mayer, Google’s ﬁrst female engineer and
Yahoo’s sixth CEO. “Search is curiosity, and that will never be done” [21].
Figure 2.7 shows the average monthly Google searches on major religious
keywords in the year 2015 from January to December, topping 12 million queries in
September. The individual keywords in descending number of searches were Jesus,
Bible, Islam, Quran, angel, God, Pope Francis, Allah, Heaven, religion, Muslim,
Christ, Hell, Satan, Devil, church, Christian, prayer, and Catholic. About 0.1 % of
the 11.1 billion Google searches in December 2015 were religious queries listed
above [22].
Figure 2.8 is a January 2016 snapshot of the Google search autocomplete pre-
dictions showing the most popular searches related to “Bible is.” “Bible is fake” tops
the list of Google searches, followed by the opposite “Bible is the word of God.”
Google search autocomplete predictions are good indictors of the current trends and
states of mind for about 250 million unique visitors every month [23]. The auto-
complete predictions are generated by a fully automated algorithm based on [24]:
(a) how often others have searched for a word; and
(b) the range of information available on the web.
Google search can drastically transform one’s life forever, especially when it
comes to religious beliefs and world views that aim to explain the meaning of life.
“Seek, and ye shall ﬁnd” (Matthew 7:7). Questioning one’s religion can lead to a
complete hundred and eighty degree turn. Morten Storm switched sides from being
a radical Islamist in the al Qaeda organization to assisting the Danish intelligence

agency and the CIA ﬁght the war on terror. Storm credited his change of heart on
his laptop computer: “I hit the ‘enter’ and I saw plenty of websites talking about
contradictions in the Quran. It took some time to research them, but once I con-
cluded that they were genuinely contradictions, that’s when it wiped totally away
my faith. That’s when I stopped being a Muslim in my heart – in my belief” [25].
By losing his religion, he has found God.
In the CNN documentary “Atheists: Inside the World of Non-Believers” aired in
March 2015, former Pentecostal preacher Jerry DeWitt recalled how he became an
atheist after 25 years of pastoral services: “One word: Google. The questions have
always been at hand, but now the answers are within our grasp.” David Silverman
of American Atheists elaborated, “Religion is factually wrong. As a result, religion
lives on ignorance of facts. The reason people are giving up on mythology is the
Internet, and the access to information it represents. When religion can exist in a
bubble, the lies it pushes cannot be challenged. But when there is a wealth of
information at the ﬁngertips of every believer, those lies can be refuted easily, from
multiple sources and multiple perspectives.” And Humanist Chaplain Greg Epstein
at Harvard University added, “People are learning more about science.” [1].
2.5
Religion and Science
Are religion and science at odds with each other? Not so according to Albert
Einstein. In the November 1930 issue of the New York Times Magazine, Einstein
wrote, “For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside

of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. Religion, on the other
hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action: it cannot justiﬁably
speak of facts and relationships between facts. According to this interpretation the
well-known conﬂicts between religion and science in the past must all be ascribed
to a misapprehension of the situation which has been described. … Science without
religion is lame, religion without science is blind” [26].
Einstein believed that religion and science could coexist without being at odds
with one another, in spite of the religious zealots and the gung-ho atheists being
constantly at war with each other. Salon writer Peter Birkenhead ingeniously
summarized the age-old heated debates on God: “The fundamentalists cultivate
something like a sulky teenager’s romanticized notion of love, and the atheists a
grumpy old bugger’s lack of belief in such nonsense” [27].
According to the second law of thermodynamics, the sum of the entropies of the
participating bodies must increase. Yet, living organisms seem to exhibit a delib-
erate anti-entropic force that hints at “by design” rather than “by chance.” Electrons,
black holes, Higgs boson (aka god particle), and gravitational waves all exist, even
though we cannot “see” them with our naked eyes. Ruling out the existence of God
is as unscientiﬁc as believing in God. Religion and science are not enemies.
Creationism and Darwinism are not necessarily contradictory; they each have an
answer to the age-old catch-22 question “Which came ﬁrst, the chicken or the egg?”
(see Fig. 2.9) Only closed-minded people are the adversaries of truth.
Since Albert Einstein published his theory of photoelectric effect in 1905 and his
general theory of relativity in 1915, it took some 100 years for scientists to take the
ﬁrst-ever photograph of light as both a particle and wave in February 2015 [28] and
to detect gravitational waves as they ripple through spacetime in September 2015
[29]. It will take more time to scientiﬁcally prove the existence of God and to
resolve the seeming contradictions in the Bible.

University of Shefﬁeld professor Tom Stafford wrote in a BBC News article that
“the Internet is giving new fuel to the way we’ve always thought. It can be both a
cause of overconﬁdence, when we mistake the boundary between what we know
and what is available to us over the web, and it can be a cause of uncertainty, when
we anticipate that we’ll be fact-checked using the web on the claims we make” [2].
2.6
Religious Radicalization
In the historical drama Agora (2009) starring Rachel Weisz, philosophy and
mathematics professor Hypatia of Alexandria was accused of witchcraft by Bishop
Cyril who cited Apostle Paul’s letter to the Corinthians that women must be in
submission (1 Corinthians 14:34–35) while ignoring the fact that Jesus appeared
ﬁrst to a women—Mary Magdalene—after his resurrection and asked her to pro-
claim the good news to his disciples (John 20:11–18). Cyril deliberately misused
the Scriptures in order to incite a mob to kidnap Hypatia and stone her to death (see
Mort De La Philosophe Hypatie. by Louis Figuier in Fig. 2.10).
After the murder of Hypatia came widespread witch hunts in Europe, followed by
the Crusades and a series of Inquisitions sanctioned or orchestrated by the Roman
Fig. 2.10 Mort De La Philosophe Hypatie. A Alexandrie (Death of philosopher Hypatia, in
Alexandria) by Louis Figuier (1865)

Catholic Church to coerce the Jews and Muslims into a change of faith. The
Christian Crusaders were essentially religious extremists and terrorists. Launched by
Pope Urban II in November 1095, the series of Crusades against Muslims and
pagans ﬁnally ended in 1291 with a death toll of 1 to 3 million people over a period
of 197 years [30].
American University associate professor emeritus David Rodier said, “If people
are intent on using religion to motivate terror or violence, they’ll ﬁnd an excuse
there no matter what the actual text says. Religion, after all, speaks to our most
basic and ultimate convictions, and if you are wanting to use violence, if you can
ﬁnd a religious justiﬁcation, then you can ﬁnd a very powerful motivation” [31].
While al Qaeda’s long-term strategy is to “bleed America to the point of
bankruptcy” [36], Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)—aka Islamic State of
Iraq and Syria (ISIS)—claims religious, political, and military authority over all
Muslims worldwide, inciting believers and pagans for an ominous apocalyptic war
among 1.6 billion Muslims and 2.2 billion Christians [37]. Abraham must be
rolling over in his grave.
2.7
Children in War and Peace
Innocent children are not immune to religious radicalization. Young adolescents
and children are being manipulated by adults to join armed conﬂicts in war and
terrorism as child soldiers [38]. The Children’s Crusade is a purported event in
1212 about a failed Crusade by European Christians including children to expel
Muslims from the Holy Land.
In modern times, as many as 1.5 million children were killed in the Holocaust
during World War II [39]. Although the 1949 Geneva Conventions and additional
protocols strictly prohibit the use of children under 15 in warfare, young children
have been ﬁghting on both sides of armed conﬂicts. Wasil Ahmad, an 11-year-old
Afghan boy, commanded a police unit of 75 men for 43 days to ﬁght the Taliban in
2015 [40]. Kids as young as eight have been used as bombers in Pakistan [41].
A 13-year-old Nigerian girl was coerced by her father to become a suicide bomber
[42]. Children as young as 10 years old patrol the streets with AK-47s in Raqqa,
ISIS’ de facto capital city in Syria [43]. FBI counterterrorism chief Michael
Steinbach told CNN that ISIS had been targeting and recruiting American children
as young as 15 in the United States [44].
Hollywood has depicted children being used as leverage in counterterrorism. In
the TV show 24 (season 2, episode 12), Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) extracted
information from a terrorist detainee by forcing him to watch a live streaming video
of the execution of his child. Bauer gave his order to the executioner, “Start with the
oldest son. If it’s not successful, move on to his younger son.” Then Bauer turned to
the detainee and said, “Tell me where the bomb is, or I’ll kill your son. I know you
think what you’re doing is right. But it’s my job to not let it happen. Please don’t let
me do this.” Bauer ﬁnally managed to break the terrorist by staging a fake execution
66

of his oldest son. “Tell me where the bomb is, and I’ll spare the rest of your family.”
In Homeland (season 3, episode “Tin Man is Down”), Peter Quinn (Rupert Friend)
assassinated a terrorist but accidentally killed the target’s young son during the
mission. Quinn subsequently used that incident (by pretending it was not an
accident) to threaten a corrupted banker with the lives of his young children. The
banker subsequently complied with Quinn’s demand to hand over the terrorists’
ﬁnancial records to the CIA.
In sad reality, terrorists could care less about children, as Council on Foreign
Relations analyst Ed Husain explained: “Al-Jazeera Arabic gives prominence to the
popular Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi, who has repeat-
edly called suicide bombings against Israelis not terrorism, but ‘martyrdom.’ He
argues that since Israelis all serve in the military, they are not civilians. Even
children, he despicably argues, are not innocent. They would grow up to serve in
the military” [45].
On the bright side, the tiny voices of children can make a big difference in a
positive way. Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani education activist and the youngest
ever Nobel Prize laureate [46]. At age 11, Yousafzai fought for girls’ right to
education. At age 15, she suffered an attack on her life by Taliban gunmen on her
way to school [47].
During the Cold War, 10-year-old American schoolgirl Samantha Reed Smith
was a peace activist and child actress from Manchester, Maine. In 1982, Smith
wrote a letter to Soviet Union General Secretary Yuri Andropov [48]:
Dear Mr. Andropov,
My name is Samantha Smith. I am ten years old. Congratulations on your new job. I have
been worrying about Russia and the United States getting into a nuclear war. Are you going
to vote to have a war or not? If you aren’t please tell me how you are going to help to not
have a war. This question you do not have to answer, but I would like to know why you
want to conquer the world or at least our country. God made the world for us to live
together in peace and not to ﬁght.
Sincerely,
Samantha Smith
After a second follow-up letter addressed to Soviet Ambassador to the US
Anatoly Dobrynin, Smith received a personal reply from Yuri Andropov and an
invitation to visit the Soviet Union:
Dear Samantha,I received your letter, which is like many others that have reached me
recently from your country and from other countries around the world.
It seems to me—I can tell by your letter—that you are a courageous and honest girl,
resembling Becky, the friend of Tom Sawyer in the famous book of your compatriot Mark
Twain. This book is well known and loved in our country by all boys and girls.
You write that you are anxious about whether there will be a nuclear war between our two
countries. And you ask are we doing anything so that war will not break out.
Your question is the most important of those that every thinking man can pose. I will reply
to you seriously and honestly.
2

Yes, Samantha, we in the Soviet Union are trying to do everything so that there will not be
war on Earth. This is what every Soviet man wants. This is what the great founder of our
state, Vladimir Lenin, taught us.
Soviet people well know what a terrible thing war is. Forty-two years ago, Nazi Germany
which strove for supremacy over the whole world, attacked our country, burned and
destroyed many thousands of our towns and villages, killed millions of Soviet men, women
and children.
In that war, which ended with our victory, we were in alliance with the United States:
together we fought for the liberation of many people from the Nazi invaders. I hope that you
know about this from your history lessons in school. And today we want very much to live in
peace, to trade and cooperate with all our neighbors on this earth—with those far away and
those nearby. And certainly with such a great country as the United States of America.
In America and in our country there are nuclear weapons—terrible weapons that can kill
millions of people in an instant. But we do not want them to be ever used. That’s precisely
why the Soviet Union solemnly declared throughout the entire world that never—never—
will it use nuclear weapons ﬁrst against any country. In general we propose to discontinue
further production of them and to proceed to the abolition of all the stockpiles on earth.
It seems to me that this is a sufﬁcient answer to your second question: “Why do you want to
wage war against the whole world or at least the United States?” We want nothing of the
kind. No one in our country—neither workers, peasants, writers nor doctors, neither
grown-ups nor children, nor members of the government—want either a big or “little” war.
We want peace—there is something that we are occupied with: growing wheat, building
and inventing, writing books and ﬂying into space. We want peace for ourselves and for all
peoples of the planet. For our children and for you, Samantha.
I invite you, if your parents will let you, to come to our country, the best time being this
summer. You will ﬁnd out about our country, meet with your contemporaries, visit an
international children’s camp—“Artek”—on the sea. And see for yourself: in the Soviet
Union, everyone is for peace and friendship among peoples.
Thank you for your letter. I wish you all the best in your young life.

While all eyes are on Islam after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, English ﬁlm director

kind of fanatics worship such a god?”
In handing down the death penalty to Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar
Tsarnaev in June 2015, Judge George O’Toole said, “Surely someone who believes

been led to believe otherwise has been maliciously and willfully deceived” [50].

send the hornet ahead of you to drive the Hivites, Canaanites and Hittites

out of your way. But I will not drive them out in a single year, because the
land would become desolate and the wild animals too numerous for you.
Little by little I will drive them out before you, until you have increased
enough to take possession of the land. (Exodus 23:27)

those wicked people, the Amalekites; wage war against them until you have

(a) If there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for

3. Those who worship other gods are punishable by death:
(a) While Israel was staying in Shittim, the men began to indulge in sexual
immorality with Moabite women, who invited them to the sacriﬁces to their
gods. The people ate the sacriﬁcial meal and bowed down before these
gods. So Israel yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor. And the LORD’s
anger burned against them. The LORD said to Moses, “Take all the leaders
of these people, kill them and expose them in broad daylight before the
LORD, so that the LORD’s ﬁerce anger may turn away from Israel.”
(Numbers 25:1–6)
4. Those who disrespect God are punishable by death regardless of their intention:
(a) When they came to the threshing ﬂoor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to
steady the ark, because the oxen stumbled. The Lord’s anger burned against
Uzzah, and he struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark. So he
died there before God. … David was afraid of God that day and asked, “How
can I ever bring the ark of God to me?” (1 Chronicles 13:9–10, 12)
5. God does not spare women and children:
(a) When the trumpets sounded, the army shouted, and at the sound of the
trumpet, when the men gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so everyone
charged straight in, and they took the city. They devoted the city to the
LORD and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it—men and
women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys. (Joshua 6:20–21)
(b) Moses was angry with the ofﬁcers of the army—the commanders of thou-
sands and commanders of hundreds—who returned from the battle. “Have
you allowed all the women to live?” he asked them. “They were the ones who
followed Balaam’s advice and enticed the Israelites to be unfaithful to the
Lord in the Peor incident, so that a plague struck the Lord’s people. Now kill
all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man, but save for
yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.” (Numbers 31:14–18)
(c) From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road,
some boys came out of the town and jeered at him. “Get out of here, baldy!”
they said. “Get out of here, baldy!” He turned around, looked at them and
called down a curse on them in the name of the Lord. Then two bears came
out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys. (2 Kings 2:23–24)
Abrahamic religions—Islam, Christianity, and Judaism—are neither religions of
peace nor religions of violence. They are storytellers of the past and forewarners of
the future. Akin to Bible commentaries that aid in the study of the Scripture, the
“Study Quran” is an English translation of the Quran with extensive commentaries
from both Shiite and Sunni scholars who represent the two major denominations of
Islam. “The commentaries don’t try to delete or hide the verses that refer to vio-
lence,” explained Editor-in-chief Seyyed Hossein Nasr. “We have to be faithful to
the text. But they can explain that war and violence were always understood as a
2

71

painful part of the human condition. … The best way to counter extremism in
modern Islam is a revival of classical Islam” [52].
Funded by King Abdullah II of Jordan and the El-Hibri Foundation which
promotes religious tolerance, the Study Quran is meant to be a rebuttal to Islamic
terrorists. However, since religious militants and terrorists believe that they are
ﬁghting a holy war and exacting God’s vengeance on the inﬁdels, the stories of
violence in the Quran, the Hebrew Bible, and the Christian Old Testament only
justify their combatant mindset and brutal tactics.
2.9
Ten Plagues of Egypt
The ten plagues of Egypt is the epitome of terrorism that eclipses all but the
Holocaust when as many as 1.5 million children including Anne Frank perished in
concentration camps [53]. According to the Book of Exodus and the Quran, the
plagues of Egypt were ten calamities that God inﬂicted upon Egypt to persuade the
Pharaoh to release the Israelites from slavery.
The plagues not only demobilized Egypt’s mighty armed forces but also terror-
ized all Egyptians—military personnel and civilians alike—by inﬂicting emotional
and physical sufferings that culminated in the death of all ﬁrstborn sons in Egypt.
History seems to hint that what goes around comes around. In chapter one of the
Book of Exodus, a new king came to power in Egypt and began to oppress the Israelites
with forced labor. The ruthless Pharaoh ordered the killing of newborn Hebrew sons:
Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every Hebrew boy that is born you must
throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.”
(Exodus 1:22)
Moses was one of the Hebrew newborns abandoned in the Nile, but he was
rescued and adopted by Pharaoh’s daughter. Moses grew up in the Egyptian palace,
but he eventually left to live among his own people. The king of Egypt passed away
and his son became the new king who continued to oppress the Israelites. Moses
was then chosen by God to free the Israelis from slavery:
The Lord said to Moses, “When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh
all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will
not let the people go. Then say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the Lord says: Israel is my
ﬁrstborn son, and I told you, Let my son go, so he may worship me. But you refused to let
him go; so I will kill your ﬁrstborn son.’”
(Exodus 4:21–23)
At midnight the LORD struck down all the ﬁrstborn in Egypt, from the ﬁrstborn of
Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the ﬁrstborn of the prisoner, who was in the dungeon,
and the ﬁrstborn of all the livestock as well. Pharaoh and all his ofﬁcials and all the
Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a
house without someone dead.
(Exodus 12:29–30)

Passover is an important Jewish festival commemorating the liberation of the
Israelites from slavery in Egypt. Islamic extremists may consider that the Hebrew
Bible (the Tanakh) and the Christian Old Testament justify violent vengeance,
killing of civilians, and slaughtering of children in the name of God. Some Islamic
terrorists claim that their terrorist attacks are revenge for what Christians did in the
Crusades [54]. For millenniums, the subconscious idea of terrorism has been
ingrained in all Abrahamic religions. Pointing ﬁnger at one of them is to blame all
of them—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam alike.
Considering the horror of the ten plagues and the long history of deep-seated
hostility, the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty in 1979 was no small feat brokered by U.S.
President Jimmy Carter, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat, and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin [55]. The 1978 Nobel Peace
Prize was awarded jointly to Sadat and Begin [56]. Jimmy Carter received the 2002
Nobel Peace Prize “for his decades of untiring effort to ﬁnd peaceful solutions to
international conﬂicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote
economic and social development” [57].

Xenophobia and Islamophobia
After the November 13th 2015 Paris attacks, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz from Texas
proposed a “religious test” for Syrian refugees so that only Christians would be
accepted into the United States [58]. In the wake of the December 2nd San
Bernardino shooting, real estate magnate and 2016 presidential candidate Donald
Trump called for surveillance against mosques and a complete ban on Muslims
entering the United States [59]. Their knee-jerk rhetoric brings to mind the Chinese
Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Japanese internment camps in World War II.
Is America in the twenty-ﬁrst century no better than Communist China who
denied entry visa to Miss World Canada Anastasia Lin for competing in Miss
World 2015 pageant because of her religious ties to Falun Gong (see Fig. 2.13)?
[60] China has reasons to consider religions as potential enemies of the state. For
instance, Christians (including 17-year-old protest leader Joshua Wong) played a
prominent role in the 2014 Umbrella Movement of sit-in street protests in Hong
Kong [61].
Unlike Communist China however, the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution guarantees religious freedom. Cruz and Trump are playing right into
the hands of the terrorists and ISIS by dividing the country instead of uniting the
American people [62]. Indeed, a 2016 terrorist recruiting video purportedly by al
Qaeda-linked militant group Al-Shabaab used footages of Malcolm X and Donald
Trump to highlight racism and religious discrimination in America [63].

Owing to safety concerns, all schools in Augusta County, Virginia were shut
down for a day in December 2015, after a backlash over an Arabic calligraphy
homework assignment from a standard workbook on world religions (see
Fig. 2.15). The center of controversy was about copying by hand the calligraphy for
shahada—the Islamic statement of faith—written in Arabic. An overreacting
Fig. 2.13 Google search on “Falun Gong” returns a Chinese spiritual practice centered on
truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance. The one large and four small Swastika symbols are
considered sacred and auspicious in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism from around 200 B.C. [64]

mother, Kimberly Herndon, kept her 9th-grade son home from school and com-
plained to the school ofﬁcials, “There was no trying about it. The sheet she gave out
was pure doctrine in its origin. I will not have my children sit under a woman
[teacher] who indoctrinates them with the Islam religion when I am a Christian”
[65]. Islamophobia has risen to a whole new level in America.
CNN commentator Mel Robbins wrote in response to the controversy, “For
those Christians who assembled in fear and buried the school in an avalanche of fear
and threats, it’s also sad. As a Christian, I can only imagine how weak your own
religious faith must be if you fear that a calligraphy assignment could change your
child’s faith” [66].
In response to the rise of anti-foreigner comments on Facebook, Mark
Zuckerberg pledged over $1 million euros in launching an “Initiative for Civil
Courage Online” in Europe to counter the racist and xenophobic Facebook posts
[67]. Moreover, Facebook actively promotes “counter speech” by offering free
advertising incentives to counter speakers in an effort to combat terrorism on social
media [68]. In January 2014, a German group named Laut Gegen Nazis (Loud
Against Nazis) launched a “Like Attack” by organizing more than 100,000 people
to bombard neo-Nazi pages on Facebook with “likes” and nice comments to defuse
racism, anti-Semitism, and anti-immigrant xenophobia [69].

In December 2015, Google CEO Sundar Pichai took to Medium blog-publishing
platform to share his experience and opinions [70]:
I came to the US from India 22 years ago. … It’s been said a million times that America is
the ‘land of opportunity’—for millions of immigrants, it’s not an abstract notion, but a
concrete description of what we ﬁnd here. … And it’s not just about opportunity. The
open-mindedness, tolerance, and acceptance of new Americans is one of the country’s
greatest strengths and most deﬁning characteristics. And that is no coincidence—America,
after all, was and is a country of immigrants. … Let’s not let fear defeat our values. We
must support Muslim and other minority communities in the US and around the world.
Instead of dividing America along religious and ethnic lines, we ought to stand
by each other in solidarity. Alexandre Dumas wrote in his 1844 historical novel The
Three Musketeers: “All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall.”
Although U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Paul Zukunft had warned that
Russia was militarizing the Arctic, he spoke of the robust communication between
the U.S. and Russian coast guards: “You pick up the phone and talk to your
counterpart. Operating in harsh environments, we ﬁnd we have a lot more in
common than we do differences” [71]. What will it take to rally all peoples and
nations to unite in the name of humanity? An all-out alien invasion or imminent
mass extinction? Perhaps a gentler proposal like a Human Heritage Month would
help to raise awareness that we are all human beings living together on the same
beautiful planet marred by undue human conﬂicts and selﬁshness.

Capital Punishment and Rehabilitation
Boston
Marathon
bomber,
a
22-year-old
Kyrgyzstani-American
Dzhokhar
Tsarnaev, hardly showed remorse in court for killing 8-year-old paciﬁst Martin
Richard and two other marathon spectators [73]. Tsarnaev was sentenced to death,
which might have helped to ease the pain of the victims’ families. However, capital
punishment is not the answer.
First, most Americans prefer the execution method to be as quick and painless as
possible [74] given that the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution
prohibits the government from imposing “cruel and unusual punishment.” In his
second grade class a year prior to his murder, 8-year-old Martin Richard handmade
a sign that reads “No more hurting people. Peace” [75]. Since the innocent and
peaceful boy was torn apart by hot shrapnel and slowly bled to death, why should
the murderer meet his demise quickly and painlessly by electrocution or lethal
injection?
Second and most importantly, capital punishment does not deter suicidal ter-
rorists who are willing to die for their causes. Death penalty only makes them feel
like martyrs. Prof. Jay Parini of Middlebury College wrote to CNN: “As a
Christian, I can’t but feel horriﬁed at the news that a federal jury has imposed the
death penalty on Dzhokar Tsarnaev. … This punishment only continues the cycle
76
N. Lee

of violence, and it will not bring peace. In fact, the execution of Tsarnaev will
transform him into a martyr, and millions around the world will ﬁnd fresh reasons
to dislike the United States” [76].
Rehabilitation is a better alternative to capital punishment. 21-year-old Abu Bakr
Mansha was a convicted al Qaeda terrorist in the United Kingdom. Usman Raja, a
renowned British cage-ﬁghting coach, has managed to rehabilitate Mansha and
de-radicalize terror convicts with a 100 % success rate using cage-ﬁghting sessions
and the teachings of Sheikh Aleey Qadir.
“Take away someone’s hate and they feel liberated,” explained Raja. “The key is
to give them a sense of purpose” [77]. Now a transformed man, Mansha tries to
prevent other young Muslims from following in his past footsteps of terror. “I could
channel my energy straight away and build something for myself,” said Mansha.
“My transformation came over time” [77].
Roman Catholic “Dead Man Walking” nun Sister Helen Prejean met with
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ﬁve times since March 2015 and she concluded that “I had
every reason to think he was taking it in and was genuinely sorry for what he did.
The groundwork and the trust was there. And I knew. I felt it” [78].
What if Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were given a chance to be rehabilitated? What if a
“born-again” Tsarnaev were to become a paciﬁst evangelizing peace among radi-
calized youths? Having been featured on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine and
the New York Times, Tsarnaev could be an efﬁcacious counterterrorism advocate.
2.12
Nine Familial Rehabilitation
During the May 2015 trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, his aunts and other relatives from
Russia ﬂew to the United States to testify on his behalf. The otherwise emotionless
defendant broke down and cried when he saw his aunt Patimat Suleimanova in her
mid-60s desperately trying to defend him [79]. Notwithstanding the last-ditch effort,
where was the family support when the young Tsarnaev needed guidance the most?
According to BBC News, children in east Jerusalem and at refugee camps in
Lebanon celebrated news of the terrorist attacks as the Twin Towers collapsed on
September 11, 2001 in Manhattan, New York City [80]. Instead of empathy and
sympathy, what atrocities have the children learned from their parents?
Shortly after the historic Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty in 1979, Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat was assassinated by Islamic jihadists in 1981. Khaled Al-Islambouli
was one of the assassins who were convicted and executed in 1982 for treason. In a
2012 interview with Mrs. Qadriya by Iran’s state-run Fars news agency, the
85-year-old mother of the assassin said, “I am very proud that my son killed Anwar
Al-Sadat. [The government] called him a terrorist, a criminal, and a murderer, but
they didn’t say that was he was defending Islam. They didn’t say anything about the
oppressed people in Palestine, about Camp David, or how Sadat sold out the
country to the Jews and violated the honor of the Islamic nation” [81].

In December 2015, Fox News asked Donald Trump how he would ﬁght ISIS if
he was elected President, and Trump replied, “We are ﬁghting a very politically
correct war. The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families,
when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about
their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you
have to take out their families” [82]. His view resembles nine familial extermina-
tions in ancient China as early as 1600 B.C. when death penalty for high treason
applied not only to the criminal himself but also to his immediate and extended
family members including his [83]:
1. spouse,
2. parents,
3. grandparents,
4. children above a certain age (usually 16),
5. grandchildren above a certain age (usually 16),
6. siblings,
7. siblings-in-law,
8. uncles, and
9. uncles’ spouses.
Former U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen was among many ofﬁcials
who reproached Trump’s egregious remark. Cohen told CNN, “The notion that we
would attack and kill the families of terrorists is something that contravenes
everything the United States stands for in this world” [84]. In March 2016, Trump
reversed course on his vow to kill the families of terrorists [85].
Nine familial exterminations were absolutely inhumane and tyrannical. A more
civilized derivative is nine familial rehabilitation which would require immediate
and extended family members to be put on fair trials for the crimes of the perpe-
trator. In the case of Mrs. Qadriya, she should have been tried in court for
encouraging her children to become assassins.
Family members serving prison time in the same correctional facility might just
provide the much-needed family bonding and quality time that could have been
absent otherwise. Nine familial rehabilitation can be a potent way to rehabilitate
criminals, deter others from committing serious crimes, and encourage parents to do
a better job in raising their children.
Toya Graham, a single mother of six in Baltimore, went to a riot and pulled her
masked son away from a protest crowd, smacking him in the head and screaming at
him. “I’m a no-tolerant mother,” Toya Graham told CBS News. “That’s my only
son and at the end of the day I don’t want him to be a Freddie Gray [who died in
police custody].” Police Commissioner Anthony Batts thanked her in his remarks to
the media, “I wish I had more parents that took charge of their kids out there
tonight” [86].
When parents are unavailable or incapable, school teachers and community
leaders ought to step into their shoes lest the vulnerable youth is either radicalized
by terrorists or victimized by entrapment. A RAND research study discussed “the
78
N. Lee

feelings of alienation—whether for social, economic, political, or psychological
reasons—shared by terrorists, and the progression they follow from early, legal
protest to acts of terrorism. … In many cases it was a matter of chance whether the
terrorist joined a left- or right-wing group” [87].
Entrapment artiﬁcially creates that chance, but it also generates deep resentment
that makes rehabilitation extremely difﬁcult if at all possible. A recent example in
2010 is the conviction of 19-year-old Somali-American college student Mohamed
Mohamud for carrying out the Black Friday bombing of the Christmas tree lighting
ceremony in Portland, Oregon, which was in fact a sting operation set up by the
FBI. Instead of guiding the confused teenage student away from terrorism, an FBI
undercover agent asked Mohamud with his power of suggestion, “So, what have
you been doing to be a good Muslim? … You can pray ﬁve times a day, train as a
doctor and go overseas, donate money to the cause, become ‘operational,’ or
become ‘a martyr’” [88]. Mohamud chose to become “operational,” and thus he
was convicted by a jury and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Meanwhile, ISIS has
lured more than 20,000 foreigners and an estimated 180 Americans into joining
their ﬁght since February 2015 [89]. The FBI agents should toil to entrap ISIS
recruiters by posing as radical students rather than to enmesh troubled teenagers by
pretending to be Islamic terrorists.

War on Drugs
Long before President George W. Bush declared the global war on terror in 2001,
President Richard Nixon declared drug abuse “public enemy number one” in 1971.
Today, the United States spends more than $51 billion annually on the war on drugs
with no end in sight [90].
Actor and comedian Tim Allen, best known for his leading role in the sitcom
Home Improvement and the voice of Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story, was given the
highest honor as a Disney Legend for television, ﬁlm, and animation-voice as well
as a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame [91]. Before his showbiz success,
however, Allen was arrested for drug trafﬁcking in 1978 and was subsequently
incarcerated for 28 months at Sandstone Federal Correctional Institution [92]. Drug
trafﬁcking can carry a mandatory death penalty in some countries like Singapore
(up until 2011) [93] and China [94].
In a 2011 interview by ABC 20/20 anchor Elizabeth Vargas, Tim Allen talked
about God and his rehabilitation [95]. He said that one day he got a call from his
parole ofﬁcer and the next day a call from Jeffrey Katzenberg, then chairman of The
Walt Disney Studios, who asked him to become a part of the Disney family. It was
nothing short of a miracle.
Surely one cannot compare Tim Allen smuggling cocaine versus Dzhokhar
Tsarnaev planting bombs. True, but illicit drugs have killed several orders of
magnitude more people than all acts of terrorism in America. Between 2001 and
2014, there were 3,030 Americans killed by terrorists on U.S. soil [96]. During that

same 14-year period, 72,348 Americans died from cocaine overdose (see Fig. 2.16)
and 52,830 lost their lives from heroin overdose (see Fig. 2.17) according to the
statistics released by the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention [97]. Nationally, deaths from drug overdoses reached an
all-time high in 2014 [98].
In a blatant confrontation of the epidemic, Los Angeles based street artist Plastic
Jesus courageously placed a life-sized Oscar statue—bending over and snorting
cocaine—on Hollywood Boulevard three days before the 2015 Academy Awards
(see Fig. 2.18). “We only hear about drug addiction when a high-proﬁle Hollywood
celeb has a meltdown and goes into rehab or dies,” Plastic Jesus told Variety [99].
For instance, actor Robert Downey Jr. spent years in substance abuse, arrests,
rehab, and relapse before a full recovery from drugs and a return to his career,
starring in blockbuster ﬁlms such as The Iron Man, The Avengers, and Sherlock
Holmes. Downey said in a 2004 interview, “Like Jung said about people using
religion to avoid a religious experience, I have managed handily to avoid a religious
experience. I don’t know where I fall. Spiritual Green Party? There were times
when I was into the whole Hare Krishna thing, which is pretty far out. Now I would
call myself a Jew-Bu, a Jewish-Buddhist. But there were many times when
Catholicism saved my butt” [100].
Apart from Hollywood, Silicon Valley is also at the center of the epidemic. In a
high proﬁle case in 2015, Google executive Forrest Hayes died of heroin overdose

on his yacht off the California coast, and his prostitute companion Alix Catherine
Tichelman was convicted of involuntary manslaughter [101]. “The billionaires I
know, almost without exception, use hallucinogens on a regular basis,” said Silicon
Valley investor Tim Ferriss. “[They’re] trying to be very disruptive and look at the
problems in the world … and ask completely new questions” [102].
In a 2015 interview by CNN technology correspondent Laurie Segall, Apple’s
early employee Daniel Kottke reminisced about his LSD trips with Steve Jobs at
Reed College: “We would take psychedelics and whole new vistas opened up. …
Once Apple started, Steve was really focused with all of his energy on making
Apple successful. And he didn’t need psychedelics for that.” Kottke added that
Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak (who designed Apple I and II computers) was not
interested in dropping acid: “Woz was in very close touch with the extent to which
his mind is a miracle of nature. He’s just fantastically interested in things … His
mind was always working perfectly well and [he] didn’t want to mess it up” [103].
Taking illicit drugs is like playing Russian roulette. In 2014, 16-year-old honor
roll student Sam Motsay died from experimenting with a designer drug similar to
the hallucinogen LSD for the ﬁrst time [104]. Misusing prescription drugs is just as
deadly. Prescription opioid overdose—the cause of death for musician Prince [105]
—had killed more than 14,000 people in 2014 according to Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) [106].
An oft-used excuse from drug dealers is that their victims, unlike terrorist tar-
gets, willingly put themselves at risk. Mexican-American actress Kate Del Castillo,

who played crime boss Pilar Zuazo on the Showtime series Weeds, caught the
attention of the notorious Mexican drug lord El Chapo Guzman after she posted
online: “Mr. Chapo: Wouldn’t it be cool if you started to trafﬁc in goodness? With
cures for diseases, with food for children in the street, with alcohol for nursing
homes. … trafﬁcking with corrupt politicians instead of with women and children
that end up as slaves? With burning all the pimps that treat a woman like she’s
worth no more than a pack of cigarettes? With no supply there is no demand. Do it,
sir, and you would be the hero of heroes. Let’s trafﬁc with love. You know how”
[107].
Actress Castillo and actor Sean Penn met Guzman at a secret location in
September 2015 to discuss an exclusive interview. In the January 2016 issue of
Rolling Stone magazine, Penn wrote about his personal meeting with Guzman and
he included the following Q&A [108]:
Penn: What is your opinion about who is to blame here, those who sell drugs, or the people
who use drugs and create a demand for them? What is the relationship between production,
sale and consumption?
Guzman: If there was no consumption, there would be no sales. It is true that consumption,
day after day, becomes bigger and bigger. So it sells and sells.
Regardless of who is to blame, the war on drugs and the war on terrorism are
equally futile if we treat only the symptoms but not the root causes [109]. It is high

time we treated drug abuse and terrorism as diseases instead of wars—curing the
patients rather than killing them. For example:
1. Dr. Carl Hart, a neuroscientist and associate professor of psychiatry and psy-
chology at Columbia University, spoke at the TEDMED 2015 conference: “I
grew up in the hood in Miami in a poor neighborhood. I came from a com-
munity in which drug use was prevalent. I kept a gun in my car. I engaged in
petty crime. I used and sold drugs. But I stand before you today also—emphasis
on also—a professor at Columbia University who studies drug addiction” [110].
2. Since 2010, Usman Raja—a renowned cage-ﬁghting coach in the United
Kingdom—has successfully rehabilitated released prisoners who were convicted
terrorists into mainstream society [111]. Employing cage-ﬁghting sessions and
the teachings of Sheikh Aleey Qadir, Raja’s mixed-martial arts (MMA) gym has
de-radicalized terror convicts with a 100 % success rate. “Take away someone’s
hate and they feel liberated,” explained Raja. “The key is to give them a sense of
purpose” [77].
2.14
Forgiveness and Humility
In the Bible, Jesus won the war against evil not by ﬁghting but by praying as he was
being cruciﬁed: “Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing”
(Luke 23:34). Forgiveness, not vengeance, yields peace and security. As President
Barack Obama said during his visit to Israel and the West Bank in March 2013,
“Peace is the only path to true security … because no wall is high enough, and no
Iron Dome is strong enough or perfect enough, to stop every enemy from inﬂicting
harm” [112].
Why is it so difﬁcult for people to forgive? Perhaps it is because of our
over-inﬂated ego. We may look down at a janitor, thinking that his life is not worth
as much as ours. Now imagine a world without janitors: Every restaurant diner,
mall shopper, movie patron, churchgoer, and ofﬁce worker is required to clean the
faucet and scrub the toilet after using a public restroom. How uncomfortable and
inconvenient everyday life would become! We should be very thankful to janitors
for doing their job well.
Whether we like it or not, nature forces chemical bonding among all living
things. We smell food because it emits molecules that enter through our nostrils and
bond with the odor receptors in our noses and lungs [113]. Through smell, babies
bond with their mothers, and pet animals bond with their owners. As unpalatable as
it is, we all have experienced public restrooms where unpleasant smelling mole-
cules emitted from strangers’ digestive tracts have bound to our olfactory receptors
and entered our lungs.
Curt Stager, ecologist and climate scientist at Paul Smith’s College, penned an
amusing and eye-opening article titled “You Are Made of Waste: Searching for the
ultimate example of recycling? Look in the mirror.” [114]:

You may think of yourself as a highly reﬁned and sophisticated creature—and you are. But
you are also full of discarded, rejected, and recycled atomic elements. … Look at one of your
ﬁngernails. Carbon makes up half of its mass, and roughly one in eight of those carbon atoms
recently emerged from a chimney or a tailpipe. … When you smile, the gleam of your teeth
obscures a slight glow from radioactive waste. … The oxygen in your lungs and bloodstream
is a highly reactive waste product generated by vegetation and microbes. … The next time
you brush your hair, think of the nitrogenous waste that helped create it. All of your proteins,
including hair keratin, contain formerly airborne nitrogen atoms. … Every atom of iron in
your blood, which helps your heart shuttle oxygen from your lungs to your cells, once helped
destroy a massive star. … The same blasts also released carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and other
elements of life, which later produced the sun, the Earth, and eventually—you.
The Book of Genesis certainly echoes Stager’s main point about “recycled”
human beings. Genesis 2:7 reads, “Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust
of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a
living being.” In William Shakespeare’s Hamlet (Act 2, Scene 2), the Prince of
Demark said to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern [115]:
What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
how inﬁnite in faculty! in form and moving how
express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
what is this quintessence of dust?
Jesus taught his disciples about humility in serving humanity: “Truly I tell you,
whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did
for me. … Whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for
me” (Matthew 25:40, 45).
2.15
Masks of God and Moral Standard
Seeing is believing, but God said to Moses on Mount Horeb, “You cannot see my
face, for no one may see me and live” (Exodus 33:20). Portraying deities as macho
warrior gods was common among the Indo-European people. The masks of God were
created by “the imperfections of man and the limits of reason”—a phrase borrowed
from President Barack Obama’s 2009 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech [116].
In The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology, American scholar Joseph
Campbell wrote, “It is clear that, whether accurate or not as to biographical detail,
the moving legend of the Cruciﬁed and Risen Christ was ﬁt to bring a new warmth,
immediacy, and humanity, to the old motifs of the beloved Tammuz, Adonis, and
Osiris cycles.”
Campbell recognized the signiﬁcance of Jesus who told the world that “I am the
way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me” (John
14:6). Moreover, he said, “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the
Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulﬁll them” (Matthew 5:17).

Jesus set a higher moral standard than the Law of Moses: “You have heard that it
was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I tell you that anyone who looks at a
woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. … Anyone
who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of
adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery” (Matthew
5:27–28, 32).
Modern society tends to condemn prostitution but turn a blind eye to adultery. In
June 2014, the FBI shut down RedBook escort service websites but not the Ashley
Madison adultery site [117]. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? Sex between
two consenting adults is ﬁne as long as it does not cause harm to one another or to
any third party. In fact, three out of four women in the United States have lived “in
sin” with a partner without being married by the age of 30 [118]. Regardless of
cohabitation or marriage, adulterers oftentimes ruin the relationships with their
partners, families, friends, and especially children if they have any [119]. In July
2015, hackers broke into AshleyMadison.com and leaked its database of 30 million
customers online [120]. Resignations, divorces, and even suicides followed.
Married with two adult children, 56-year-old Baptist pastor John Gibson in New
Orleans killed himself after learning that his name was publicly exposed [121].
2.16
Prostitution and Gender Discrimination
The Bible surprisingly contains signiﬁcant anti-stigmatization of prostitutes. For
instance, when Israeli leader Joshua invaded the city of Jericho, only Rahab the
prostitute and her family were spared from annihilation (Joshua 6:17). “You see that
a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone. In the same
way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when
she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction?” (James
2:24–25).
Take another example, when the Israelis were in trouble with the Ammonites,
their elders turned to Jephthah for help:
Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior. His father was Gilead; his mother was a
prostitute. … Jephthah said to them [the elders], “Didn’t you hate me and drive me from my
father’s house? Why do you come to me now, when you’re in trouble?” The elders of
Gilead said to him, “Nevertheless, we are turning to you now; come with us to ﬁght the
Ammonites, and you will be head over all of us who live in Gilead.” … Jephthah led Israel
six years. (Judges 11:1, 11:7–8, 12:7)
Sex, food, water, and air are four basic survival elements without which
humankind would cease to exist. 795 million people on earth are suffering from
malnutrition [122], 663 million do not have access to safe drinking water [123], and
7 million people die annually from air pollution exposure [124]. Yet a whopping
$186 billion dollars per year are squandered on prostitution worldwide [125]. One
sex worker told Laurie Segall at CNN that she had earned nearly $1 million from
2

afﬂuent men in Silicon Valley [126]. A million U.S. dollars can feed a lot of hungry
and thirsty people.
In January 2016, Missouri House of Representative Bart Korman introduced a
bill that requires lobbyists to report sexual relations with state legislators as a “gift”
in their disclosures: “For purposes of subdivision (2) of this subsection, the term
‘gift’ shall include sexual relations between a registered lobbyist and a member of
the general assembly or his or her staff. Relations between married persons or
between persons who entered into a relationship prior to the registration of the
lobbyist, the election of the member to the general assembly, or the employment of
the staff person shall not be reportable under this subdivision. The reporting of
sexual relations for purposes of this subdivision shall not require a dollar valuation”
[127].
Science ﬁction TV series Fireﬂy created by Joss Whedon also challenged the
moral question of high-society courtesans similar to Japanese geisha [128].
Although Hollywood features many heroines in popular ﬁlms, they are mostly
fantasy and sci-ﬁgenres that do not translate into the real world. Even within the
make-believe universe, Chloë Grace Moretz who played Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass
(2010) and Kick-Ass 2 (2013) told Digital Spy in a 2014 interview: “Whenever
there’s a female superhero, it’s always a more sexual plotline rather than seeing an
actual character on screen. I don’t think that’s cool. I think it’s rather sad. I would
love to change that” [129]. The semi-documentary blockbuster ﬁlm The Imitation
Game (2014) shows a solitary female codebreaker—Keira Knightley—in a
male-dominated workplace when in fact 8,000 out of 12,000 codebreakers at
Bletchley Park were women [130].
Changes are coming, albeit rather slowly. Every now and then there are movies
such as The Intern (2015) where the lead female character played by Anne
Hathaway is the founder of a successful Internet company while her husband is a
stay-at-home dad [131]. It accurately reﬂects the steady increase of the number of
househusbands since a 2002 survey at Fortune magazine’s Most Powerful Women
Summit [132]. In the 2008 remake of the 1951 ﬁlm The Day the Earth Stood Still,
Mrs. Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) as a secretary was rewritten to be Dr. Helen
Benson (Jennifer Connelly) as an astrobiology professor at Princeton University.
Speaking of women in power, Ann Elizabeth Dunwoody was the ﬁrst woman to
become Commanding General of U.S. Army Materiel Command in 2008 [133].
Regina Dugan was appointed the ﬁrst female director of Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 2009 [134]. Letitia “Tish” Long became the
ﬁrst woman in charge of a major U.S. intelligence agency—the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in 2010 [135]. The White House named
Megan Smith as the 3rd Chief Technology Ofﬁcer of the United States in 2014
[136]. General Lori Robinson became the ﬁrst female combatant commander to
lead the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and U.S.
Northern Command (NORTHCOM) in 2016 [137]. At the time of writing, if former
First Lady and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton becomes the ﬁrst female
President of the United States, she will join the prestigious list of some 77 female
heads of state in world history.

Will all that breaking-the-glass-ceiling progress eradicate gender discrimination?
Do people consider intelligent and powerful women a one of a kind or an anomaly
which does not apply to the female population at large? Why are only 18 % of
computer science graduates women [138] when the world’s ﬁrst computer pro-
grammer was English mathematician Ada Lovelace, best known for her algorithmic
work on Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine?
It takes a lot more women than just some female geniuses, presidents, military
combat generals, CEOs, and the new $20 bills with Harriet Tubman [139] to
dismantle the entrenched mindset of chauvinism and patriarchy. Duke University
student and porn star Belle Knox (Miriam Weeks) wrote in xoJane: “I, like all other
sex workers, want to be treated with dignity and respect. … The virgin-whore
dichotomy is an insidious standard that we have unfairly placed upon women.
Women are supposed to be outwardly pure and modest, while at the same time
being sexually alluring and available. If a woman does not have sex after a date, she
will be labeled as a prude. If she does have sex, she will be referred to later as a ho
or a slut” [140].
The long history of male supremacy has prompted British-Australian feminist
Sheila Jeffreys to opine that marriage is a form of prostitution in some cases.
“Prostitution and marriage have always been related,” said Jeffreys. “The right of
men to women’s bodies for sexual use has not gone but remains an assumption at
the basis of heterosexual relationships” [141]. The alternatives such as cohabitation,
open marriage, and friends with beneﬁts are not helping the situation either.
Online sexual harassment and the disproportionate underrepresentation of
inﬂuential women in Wikipedia have motivated Emily Temple-Wood to cofound
WikiProject Women Scientists in 2012 [142]. She has since written hundreds of
Wikipedia articles about women in science [143] and has identiﬁed more than 4,400
notable female scientists who do not yet have a page on Wikipedia [144].
2.17
Pornography, Feminism, and Technology
In addition to gender discrimination, society’s double standards legalize pornog-
raphy as freedom of expression protected under the First Amendment while they
penalize prostitution against personal rights and liberty. The truth is that pornog-
raphy is essentially prostitution in front of cameras, and porn producers are no
different from pimps who recruit women and make money from their sex acts.
Produced by Rashida Jones, Abigail Disney, and other notables, Netﬂix docu-
mentary Hot Girls Wanted (2015) exposes the dark side of the porn industry as
naive young women are lured by money and fame [145]. Some viewers may see a
parallel between that and Amy Berg’s documentary An Open Secret (2014) which
depicts underage abuse and sexual exploitation in the mainstream Hollywood
entertainment industry [146]. There are good and bad people in every line of
business, every stratum of society, every organization, and sadly every church.

The question is: What do we do about it? As Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne)
told Neo (Keanu Reeves) in The Matrix (1999), “You take the blue pill—the story
ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take
the red pill—you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole
goes. Remember: all I’m offering is the truth. Nothing more” [147]. The majority
has chosen the blue pill and perpetuated the status quo.
Thanks to the Internet, pornography has become ubiquitous and ballooned to a
$97 billion industry in 2015 [148]. Figure 2.19 shows the average monthly Google
searches on the keywords porn, sex, and erotica from March 2015 to February
2016, averaging 162 million queries from month to month with little to no ﬂuc-
tuation. In a 2016 report by evangelical Christian polling ﬁrm the Barna Group, a
survey of over 3,000 Americans uncovered that [149]:
• 57 % of pastors and 64 % of youth pastors have struggled with porn either
currently or in the past,
• The attitudes of Americans towards pornography are shifting from “bad for
society” to neutrality or “good for society,” and
• Most teens and young adults view “not recycling” as more immoral than
viewing porn.

In 2015, Danish sexology professor Christian Graugaard at Aalborg University
suggested that pornography should be shown in schools as part of sex education
classes [150]. Graugaard’s philosophy is in sharp contrast to the 2015 story of the
enraged mother Gail Horalek who complained to the school ofﬁcials for assigning
Anne Frank’s The Diary of a Young Girl to her 7th-grade daughter, calling the
passages on puberty in the unabridged version pornographic [151]. Horalek would
probably have requested to ban the Christian Old Testament too if she had read the
stories of adultery (e.g. 2 Samuel 12:11–12), prostitution (e.g. Ezekiel 23:1–21),
rape (e.g. 2 Samuel 13:10–14), incest (e.g. Genesis 19:30–38), and other cardinal
sins that rival any daytime soap opera on television. The Bible is the most brutally
honest book that does not whitewash or sugarcoat history.
Prof. Graugaard admitted that some adolescents were incapable of differentiating
between pornography and the reality of sexual relationships. At TED 2009,
advertising consultant Cindy Gallop argued that “hardcore pornography had dis-
torted the way a generation of young men think about sex” [152].
Feminism rejects chauvinism but accepts chivalry [153]. Harry Potter heroine
Emma Watson has served as a U.N. Women’s Global Goodwill Ambassador since
2014 [154]. In a February 2016 interview, American feminist Gloria Steinem and
Emma Watson discussed the promotion of erotica as opposed to pornography that
degrades or humiliates women. Steinem said, “We should at least have a word for
sex that is mutual and pleasurable and not about domination, pain, violence,
humiliation and so on. … We were both worried about the envelopment of the earth
in pornographic images. Young people especially. The right wing (right wing just
in a general way) on one hand is suppressing sex education and allowing, or
proﬁteering off pornography so young people look at porno and think that’s it.
That’s what is supposed to be. I was hoping that having a word for erotica, for
shared mutual pleasurable empathetic sex, real pleasurable sex would help us do
something about pornography” [155].
Whether sex is called porn or erotica, the adult industry has been highly effective
in driving innovation and mass adoption of new technologies: VCR, streaming
video, online credit card transactions, haptics, and Snapchat, just to name a few
[156]. The cover of Playboy’s ﬁrst-ever non-nude issue in March 2016 was made to
look like a selﬁe on Snapchat [157]. At CES 2016 in Las Vegas, Mashable’s
product analyst Raymond Wong tried out VR porn on a Samsung Gear VR headset
and was blown away by it [158]. Like social media, virtual reality could exacerbate
the decrease of face-to-face communication and accelerate the decay of interper-
sonal relationships in the real world.

Unmasking of God and Enlightening Humankind
Jesus came to enlighten humankind about God, morality, and truth. The Sadducees
and Pharisees had hoped that the Messiah would lead the Israelites to rebel against
the ruling Roman Empire, just as Moses did against the Egyptian Pharaoh with the
2

89

ten plagues and the parting of the Red Sea. To the dismay of the Sadducees and
Pharisees, Jesus was a paciﬁst: “You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your
neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those
who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes
his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the
unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? … And if
you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? …”
(Matthew 5:43–47).
Jesus had unmasked God to reveal that:
1. God is forgiving:
(a) You have heard that it was said, “Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.” But I tell
you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn
to them the other cheek also. (Matthew 5:38–39)
(b) You have heard that it was said, “Love your neighbor and hate your
enemy.” But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute
you. (Matthew 5:43–44)
2. God is a peacemaker:
(a) Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
(Matthew 5:9)
(b) Put your sword back in its place, for all who draw the sword will die by the
sword. Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at
my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? (Matthew 26:52)
3. God is nonjudgmental:
(a) The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in
adultery. They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus,
“Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the Law Moses
commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?” They were
using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But
Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his ﬁnger. When
they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any
one of you who is without sin be the ﬁrst to throw a stone at her.” (John
8:3–7)
(b) A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating
at the Pharisee’s house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume.
As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with
her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured
perfume on them. When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said
to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him
and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner.” … Then Jesus turned
toward the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? … I tell
you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But
whoever has been forgiven little loves little.” (Luke 7:37–39, 44, 47)

4. God is benevolent:
(a) Then the King will say to those on his right, “Come, you who are blessed by
my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the
creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I
was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you
invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you
looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.” Then the
righteous will answer him, “Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed
you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a
stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we
see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?” The King will reply, “Truly I
tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of
mine, you did for me.” (Matthew 25:34–40)
5. God loves children:
(a) At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who, then, is the
greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” He called a little child to him, and
placed the child among them. And he said: “Truly I tell you, unless you
change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of
heaven. Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the
greatest in the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 18:1–4)
(b) Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on
them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked them. Jesus said, “Let the
little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of
heaven belongs to such as these.” (Matthew 19:13–14)
Following in Jesus’ footsteps, Pope Francis expressed his nonjudgmental stand
in The Joy of Love (AMORIS LAETITIA): “A pastor cannot feel that it is enough
simply to apply moral laws to those living in ‘irregular’ situations, as if they were
stones to throw at people’s lives. This would bespeak the closed heart of one used
to hiding behind the Church’s teachings, ‘sitting on the chair of Moses and judging
at times with superiority and superﬁciality’” [159]. The Pope denounced both
favoritism and prejudice: “A gay person who is seeking God, who is of good will—
well, who am I to judge him? The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this
very well. It says one must not marginalize these persons, they must be integrated
into society. The problem isn’t this [homosexual] orientation—we must be like
brothers and sisters. The problem is something else, the problem is lobbying either
for this orientation or a political lobby or a Masonic lobby” [160].
Indeed, Jesus had predicted religious inﬁghting amongst Abrahamic religions
and religious denominations: “Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to
the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn ‘a man
against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law—a man’s enemies will be the members of his own household.’”

10:34–36)

anti-Semitism, global Jihadism, and antichrists all have created havoc and suffering
on earth that are more terrifying than any Stephen King novel. Abraham must be
rolling in his grave many times over.
It is up to humankind to make peace on earth, not by force but based on free will.
Albert Einstein said, “Whatever there is of God and goodness in the universe, it
must work itself out and express itself through us. We cannot stand aside and let
God do it” [8]. In February 2011, Muslims and Christians in Egypt set aside
religious tensions and joined hands in anti-Mubarak protest in Tahrir Square,
chanting “Arise O Egypt, arise. Arise Egyptians: Muslims, Christians and Jews”
[161].
2.19
Separation of Church and State
If the ﬁrst Christians—as described in the ﬁrst chapters of the Book of Acts—were
to rule the country, the United States of America would embrace socialism or
perhaps even communism:
All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions
was their own, but they shared everything they had. With great power the apostles con-
tinued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God’s grace was so powerfully at
work in them all that there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those
who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales and put it at the
apostles’ feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need. (Acts 4:32)
America’s Founding Fathers had a different idea. Article VI of the U.S.
Constitution declares that “no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualiﬁcation
to any Ofﬁce or public Trust under the United States” [162] and the First Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution states that “Congress shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof” [163].
In the 1971 court case Lemon v. Kurtzman, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the
separation of church and state in siding with civil rights activist Alton T. Lemon’s
objection to state aid to religious schools. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger deﬁned
the “Lemon Test” as [164]:
First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose;
Second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits
religion;
Finally, the statute must not foster “an excessive government entanglement with religion.”
However, the Chief Justice also cautioned that “judicial caveats against entan-
glement must recognize that the line of separation, far from being a ‘wall,’ is a
blurred, indistinct and variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a
particular relationship” [165].
Indeed, according to the Pew Research Center report entitled “Faith and the 2016
Campaign,” 51 % of adults said that they would be less likely to vote for a
92
N. Lee

presidential candidate who does not believe in God, as compared to 37 % less likely
for a candidate who had an extramarital affair and 20 % less likely for a former
marijuana smoker [166]. Christians carry more clout in American politics.
Separation of church and state is easier said than done. For example:
1. During the 2004 presidential campaign, George W. Bush met with the Amish
(see Fig. 2.20) in Pennsylvania and Ohio—two of the swing states—to convince
them to vote based on their conservative Christian outlook. As a result, some
Amish voted for the ﬁrst and only time in their lives [167].
2. U.S. House Representative Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii is the ﬁrst American
Hindu elected to Congress in 2012. Opponents argued that “she shouldn’t be
allowed to serve because her religion doesn’t align with the Constitution.”
Gabbard responded that “a pluralistic, secular government is the only way to
ensure that all individuals have the freedom to follow the religious path of their
choice” [168].
3. For the 2012 presidential election, a research study by Prof. Benjamin Knoll of
Centre College showed that “about 1 out of every 20 Republicans decided to
stay home instead of turning out to vote for their party’s nominee [Mitt
Romney] because they don’t perceive Mormons as Christian” [169].
4. During the 2016 presidential race, Pope Francis suggested that Donald Trump
was not a Christian and ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel asked U.S. Senator Bernie
Sanders from Vermont if he believed in God. Trump lashed out at the Pope, “If
and when the Vatican is attacked, the pope would only wish and have prayed
that Donald Trump would have been elected president” [170] whereas Sanders
replied to Kimmel evasively, “Well, you know, I am who I am. And what I
believe in, what my spirituality is about, is that we’re all in this together—that I
think it’s not a good thing to believe, as human beings, that we can turn our
backs on the suffering of other people. And this is not Judaism. This is what
Pope Francis is talking about: That we cannot worship just billionaires and the
making of more and more money. Life is more than that” [171].

Trinity of Religions, Arts, and Sciences
Whenever people talk about religions, morality, and politics, they often get into
heated arguments. As a result, people tend to avoid these sensitive topics altogether.
Partly due to the growing apathy, voter turnout in America has dropped to a 72-year
low in 2015 [172] and church attendance has been in steady decline for years [173].
American comedian and television host Bill Maher told the audience on ABC’s
Jimmy Kimmel Live, “We have to stop saying ‘Well, we should not insult a great
religion.’ First of all, there are no great religions. There are all stupid and dan-
gerous. … We should insult them, and we should be able to insult whatever we
want” [174]. Pope Francis begs to differ. The Pope said, “You don’t kill in God’s

name. … [But] you cannot provoke, you cannot insult the faith of others. You
cannot make fun of the faith of others” [175].
God exists with or without religions. A religion is a human expression and
understanding of God. Mahatma Gandhi wrote in his weekly newspaper Harijan
that “each religion has its own contribution to make to human evolution. I regard
the great faiths of the world as so many branches of a tree, each distinct from the
other though having the same source” [12]. Even the anti-religious and fascist
Adolf Hitler invoked the name of God in many of his public speeches to motivate
Nazi Germany. He said, “For one cannot assume that God exists to help people who
are too cowardly and too lazy to help themselves and think that God exists only to
make up for the weakness of mankind” [176].
Atheists do away with both God and religions altogether, and replace them with
their own beliefs and expressions. Extropian Max More opines that the future
belongs to posthumanity with “no more gods, no more faith, no more timid holding
back” [177]. Nonetheless, there is an aphoristic saying that “there are no atheists in
foxholes.” During an edge-of-your-seat chase scene in the Academy Award
Fig. 2.20 Google search on “Amish” displays a Wikipedia deﬁnition for the Amish as “a group of
traditionalist Christian church fellowships with Swiss Anabaptist origins” and related topics on
Mennonites, Anabaptists, and “The Plain People.”

winning ﬁlm Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), the evil Immortan Joe (Hugh
Keays-Byrne) and the fanatical War Boys were going after Max (Tom Hardy),
Furiosa (Charlize Theron), and the Five Wives. One of the wives—The Dag
(Abbey Lee Kershaw)—started to mutter a prayer, and Toast the Knowing (Zoë
Kravitz) looked at her curiously:
Toast the Knowing: What are you doing?
The Dag: Praying.
Toast the Knowing: To who?
The Dag: Anyone that’s listening.
God and religions may take on different names, forms, and meanings in different
cultures, civilizations, and stages of human evolution. But as long as we are human,
or posthuman for that matter, there is no escape from God and religions. Like the
song Hotel California by the Eagles, “You can check out any time you like, but you
can never leave!” Denying the existence of God the Creator is like an artiﬁcial
intelligent machine doubting the existence of human inventors.
The religious, moral, and political entanglement is mirrored in physics where
quantum entanglement—a word coined by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger—
describes “a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs or groups of particles are
generated or interact in ways such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be
described independently—instead, a quantum state may be given for the system as a
whole” [178].
Although Albert Einstein rejected quantum theory by calling the entanglement a
“spooky action across distance” [179], he was correct in saying that “all religions,
arts and sciences are branches of the same tree.” Einstein explained that “all these
aspirations are directed toward ennobling man’s life, lifting it from the sphere of
mere physical existence and leading the individual towards freedom. It is no mere
chance that our older universities developed from clerical schools. Both churches
and universities—insofar as they live up to their true function—serve the enno-
blement of the individual. They seek to fulﬁll this great task by spreading moral and
cultural understanding, renouncing the use of brute force” [180].
The ultimate wisdom comes from the trinity of religions, arts, and sciences (see
The Garden of Earthly Delights triptych by Hieronymus Bosch in Figs. 2.21 and
2.22). Nature, for instance, shows us its artistic beauty that sciences explain the hows
and religions contemplate the whys. Astrology, feng shui, and other pseudoscience
are attempts to predict or account for life circumstances. Jesus offered humankind a
profound enlightenment on the mystery of life, the universe, and everything (pun
intended for paying homage to English writer Douglas Adams). Figure 2.23 is a

than God (see Fig. 2.11) and the Bible (see Fig. 2.8) in the top 10 list of Google
searches among some 250 million unique visitors every month.

Death, Resurrection, and Future of Religions
In Star Wars (1977), Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) sacriﬁced
himself in the battle with Darth Vader (David Prowse) so that he could become a
stronger “Force ghost” to help guide the young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) (see
Fig. 2.24) [181]. The assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. on April 4, 1968
accelerated the American civil rights movement [182]. The cruciﬁxion of Jesus
brought forth the world’s largest religion—Christianity—with about 2.2 billion
followers in 2015 [6].
Jesus was raised from the dead on the third day when he appeared to his
disciples:
“Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have
ﬂesh and bones, as you see I have.” When he had said this, he showed them his hands and
feet. And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them,
“Do you have anything here to eat?” They gave him a piece of broiled ﬁsh, and he took it
and ate it in their presence. (Luke 24:39–43)
Unlike other resurrection stories such as Zarephath (1 Kings 17:17–24),
Shunamite (2 Kings 4:18–37), Jairus (Mark 5:35–43), and Lazarus (John 11:1–44),
Apostle Paul spoke of immortality:
But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they
come?”… When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of
wheat or of something else. … So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that
is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; … Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not
all sleep, but we will all be changed – in a ﬂash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be
changed. For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with

immortality. When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal
with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “Death has been swallowed
up in victory.” (1 Corinthians 15:35, 37, 42, 51–54)
Paul’s statement in 1 Corinthians 15:51—“We will not all sleep, but we will all
be changed”—invigorates the belief of some transhumanists in achieving immor-
tality during their lifetime. After all, no one in their current human form can see the
face of God and live (Exodus 33:20). Lincoln Cannon, founder of the Mormon
Transhumanist Association, talks about transﬁgurism as a future of religion as
exempliﬁed by religious transhumanists in Chap. 19 of this book.
2.22
And Now for Something Completely Different, or not
In the comical spirit of Monty Python, we could use a sense of humor while we
unravel the Gordian knot of religious, moral, and political entanglement that forms
the nexus between ideologies and actions in our everyday life (see Fig. 2.25):
1. Being a student preacher in high school, I co-wrote a gospel song with one of
my best friends Chau Kai Ton for publication in our yearbook. My
non-Christian friends oftentimes greeted me by saying, “Ah, here comes Jesus!”
Three decades later, Chau and I collaborated again, this time for the academic
book Digital Da Vinci: Computers in Music [183].
2. In an MTV interview with Dutch ﬁlmmaker Paul Verhoeven in 2010, the
director called the original RoboCop “the American Jesus.” He explained that
“the point of ‘RoboCop,’ of course, is it is a Christ story. It is about a guy that
gets cruciﬁed after 50 min, then is resurrected in the next 50 min and then is like
Fig. 2.24 Google Search on “Force ghost” returns a Knowledge Graph deﬁnition from
about.com: “A Force ghost is the spirit of a dead Force user who is able to communicate with
the living. The concept ﬁrst appears in The Empire Strikes Back, when Obi-Wan Kenobi’s spirit
communicates with Luke and Yoda.”

the super-cop of the world, but is also a Jesus ﬁgure as he walks over water at
the end. … I put something just underneath the water so [Peter Weller] could
walk over the water and say this wonderful line… ‘I am not arresting you
anymore.’ Meaning, ‘I’m going to shoot you.’ And that is of course the
American Jesus” [184].
3. British singer-songwriter David Bowie said in an unaired CBS 60 min interview
in 2003 that “searching for music is like searching for God. They are very
similar. There’s an effort to reclaim the unmentionable, the unsayable, the
unseeable, the unspeakable, all those things come into being a composer, into
writing music, into searching for notes and pieces of musical information that
don’t exist” [185].
4. If American rock band R.E.M. were to rewrite the lyrics to their 1991 hit song
“Losing My Religion” [186] for Generation Z today, they could simply change
one word, from “losing” to “Googling”: ♫Oh life, it’s bigger. It’s bigger than
you and you are not me. … Oh no, I’ve said too much. I haven’t said enough.
That’s me in the corner. That’s me in the spotlight Googling my religion. … ♫
5. If we Google “prayers,” the library of Catholic prayers is the number one
organic search result (see Fig. 2.26). However, if we Google “Google prayers,”
the Church of Google becomes number one. Its webpage titled “Google Prayers:

Is Google God?—The Church of Google” contains a parody of the Lord’s
Prayer by Matt Bowen [187]:
Our Google, who art in cyberspace,
Hallowed be thy domain.
Thy search to come,
Thy results be done,
On 127.0.0.1 as it is in the Googleplex.
Give us this day our daily searches,
And forgive us our spam,
As we forgive those who spam against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from Microsoft.
For thine is the search engine,
And the power,
And the glory,
Forever and ever.
Amen.

Chapter 3
Google Versus Death; To Be, Or Not
to Be?
Newton Lee
Are people really focused on the right things? One of the things
I thought was amazing is that if you solve cancer … it’s not as
big an advance as you might think.
—Larry Page
Prologue “Can Google Solve Death?” graced the cover of the TIME Magazine on
September 30, 2013. “We’re going to gradually enhance ourselves,” said Ray
Kurzweil, futurist and engineering director at Google. “That’s the nature of being
human—we transcend our limitations” [1]. Pacemakers, prosthesis, stentrode, op-
togenetics, antibiotics, and other medical advancements exemplify the use of
technology to prolong life and to improve quality of life. Even Pope Francis gave
his blessing to human-animal chimera research for organ transplants [2]. We are all
transhumanists in varying degrees.
3.1
Existential Threats to Humankind
Dinosaurs, Neanderthals, and Denisovans did not evolve and adapt fast enough, and
therefore they became extinct. Modus operandi or business as usual will doom the
human race to mass extinction. Astrophysicist Stephen Hawking said in a CNN
interview in 2008, “It will be difﬁcult enough to avoid disaster on planet Earth in
the next 100 years, let alone next thousand, or million. … I see great dangers for the
human race. There have been a number of times in the past when its survival has
been a question of touch and go. The Cuban missile crisis in 1963 was one of these.

The frequency of such occasions is likely to increase in the future. We shall need
great care and judgment to negotiate them all successfully” [3].
In the June 2015 issue of Science Advances journal published by the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, researchers at National Autonomous
University of Mexico, Stanford University, University of California Berkeley,
Princeton University, and University of Florida raised the specter of Earth’s biota
entering a sixth “mass extinction.” The last Big Five were Ordovician-Silurian, Late
Devonian, Permian, Triassic-Jurassic, Cretaceous-Tertiary (or K-T) extinctions.
The Permian period ended with 96 % of all species perished; and the K-T wiped out
at least half of all species on Earth including the dinosaurs [4].
Prof. Gerardo Ceballos and his coauthors wrote, “We can conﬁdently conclude
that modern extinction rates are exceptionally high, that they are increasing, and
that they suggest a mass extinction under way—the sixth of its kind in Earth’s 4.5
billion years of history. … If the currently elevated extinction pace is allowed to
continue, humans will soon (in as little as three human lifetimes) be deprived of
many biodiversity beneﬁts. … The loss of biodiversity is one of the most critical
current environmental problems, threatening valuable ecosystem services and
human well-being” [5].
In January 2016, The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Science and Security
Board announced that the Doomsday Clock remained at 11:57. “Three minutes (to
midnight) is too close. Far too close,” stated the Bulletin. “We, the members of the
Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, want to be
clear about our decision not to move the hands of the Doomsday Clock in 2016:
That decision is not good news, but an expression of dismay that world leaders
continue to fail to focus their efforts and the world’s attention on reducing the
extreme danger posed by nuclear weapons and climate change. When we call these
dangers existential, that is exactly what we mean: They threaten the very existence
of civilization and therefore should be the ﬁrst order of business for leaders who
care about their constituents and their countries” [6].
Figure 3.1 shows the changes in the time of the Doomsday Clock of the Bulletin
of the Atomic Scientists from 1947 to 2015 while 2016 remains the same as the
previous year [7]. The closest approach to midnight was in 1953 when the United

States and the Soviet Union tested thermonuclear devices within 9 months of one
another. The furthest from midnight was in 1991 when the United States and Soviet
Union signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), followed by the
Soviet Union dissolution on December 26.
The world may one day come to its senses and adopt long-lasting peace; but are
we well-equipped to deal with existential threats posed by natural disasters and
biohazards?
1. Whether climate change is due to carbon dioxide emission [8], shift in Earth’s
magnetic poles [9], or some other reasons, global warming poses existential
threat that must be addressed. Dire consequences of climate change include
more severe droughts, heat waves, hurricanes, and raising sea levels [10].
Meteorologists have noticed the record early start of the Greenland ice melt in
April 2016. Greenland has been losing ice at a pace of 287 billion metric tons
per year, and sea levels around the world could rise by 20 feet if the ice sheet in
the size of Alaska were to melt completely [11]. Due to the treats of tsunamis
and sea level rise, the Quinault Indian Nation (QIN) located on the Paciﬁc coast
of Washington’s Olympic Peninsula has been planning to relocate the com-
munity to higher ground [12].
2. The Cascadia Fault at the bottom of the Paciﬁc Ocean can create an earthquake
almost 30 times more energetic than the San Andreas Fault [13]. In January
1700, the Cascadia caused the largest earthquake in North America, setting off a
tsunami that not only struck the Paciﬁc coast and also damaged Japan’s coastal
villages across the Paciﬁc Ocean [14].
3. While Admiral Michael Rogers, Director of the National Security Agency
(NSA), has justiﬁably sounded the alarm on cyber attacks of critical infras-
tructure [15, 16], the U.S. government is not paying enough attention to
crumbling bridges, decaying pipelines, and inadequate storage facilities for
natural gas that are all highly susceptible to serious damage by earthquakes. In
August 2011, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake damaged the Washington Monument
[17]. Today, nearly 60,000 bridges across the U.S. are in desperate need of
repair. “It’s just eroding and concrete is falling off,” said National Park Service
spokeswoman Jenny Anzelmo-Sarles, referring to the Arlington Memorial
Bridge crossed by 68,000 vehicles every day [18]. Gas Pipe Safety Foundation
cofounder Kimberly Archie called the aging natural gas infrastructure in
American cities a “ticking time bomb” [19]. The 2015 gas leak in Porter Ranch,
California, for instance, released an estimated 80,000 metric tons of mostly
methane into the atmosphere, affecting the health of over 30,000 residents. It
took 4 months to permanently seal the leak [20].
4. The Texas Tribune and ProPublica reported in March 2016 that “Houston … is
home to the nation’s largest reﬁning and petrochemical complex, where billions
of gallons of oil and dangerous chemicals are stored. And it’s a sitting duck for
the next big hurricane. Why isn’t Texas ready?” [21]. Rice University professor

Phil Bedient summed up the inaction of the local government: “We’ve done
nothing to shore up the coastline, to add resiliency … to do anything.”
5. In May 2016, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released an
alarming statistics that each year in the United States, at least 2 million people
become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics and at least 23,000
people die each year as a direct result of these infections [22]. Superbugs—
bacteria that are resistant to all antibiotics including the last-resort nephrotoxic
drug Colistin—have infected humans and animals in Asia, Europe, the United
States, and more than 20 countries worldwide. “This shows that we are right on the
verge of getting into the territory of routine bacterial infections being untreatable,”
said Steven Roach, food safety program director at the Food Animal Concerns
Trust. “It underscores the failure of both the federal government and Congress,
and the industry, to get a grasp of the problem. We can’t continue to drag our feet
on taking needed action” [23]. Also in May 2016, Review on Antimicrobial
Resistance issued a ﬁnal report which projects that by 2050, more than 10 million
people will die from superbugs each year, outpacing cancer (8.2 million), diabetes
(1.5 million), diarrheal disease (1.4 million), and other illnesses [24].
Although natural disasters and biohazards may be unavoidable, the devastating
domino effects can be alleviated if we are well informed and better prepared. For
example: U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) along with university partners have been
developing and testing an earthquake early warning system (EEWS) called
ShakeAlert [25]. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
employs an automated collision monitoring system known as Sentry and publishes a
list of potential future Earth impact with Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) at http://neo.
jpl.nasa.gov/risk/. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
Fig. 3.2 Climate Explorer offers interactive visualizations for exploring maps and data to identify
potential climate impacts. This diagram shows the impacts a rising sea level may have on coastal
regions of the United States

N. Lee

has created an interactive Climate Explorer tool to raise awareness by allowing users
to visualize historical data and impacts of climate changes (see Fig. 3.2) [26]. Local
community volunteers such as Food Forward in Southern California convene at
private properties, public spaces, and farmers and wholesale markets to recover
excess fruits and vegetables that would otherwise go to waste, donating them to
direct-service agencies that feed over 100,000 people in need each month [27].
Leading by example, Google is the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable
energy with a commitment to purchase nearly 2 GW of green energy [28].
Launched in June 2015, Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs with CEO Dan Doctoroff
focuses on urban design by pursuing technologies to “cut pollution, curb energy
use, streamline transportation, and reduce the cost of city living” [29]. Reducing the
cost of city living is music to the ears of angry protesters who in December 2013
blockaded an Apple employee shuttle bus in San Francisco and threw rocks at a
Google employee shuttle bus in Oakland to call attention to low-income resi-
dents displaced by rising rents [30].
In Hollywood, the 2006 documentary Who Killed the Electric Car? and the 2011
feature ﬁlm Revenge of the Electric Car by Chris Paine educated the public about a
better alternative to gasoline powered vehicles. Following the zero-emissions
vehicle (ZEV) mandate, eight U.S. states (California, Connecticut, Maryland,
Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont) and ﬁve countries
(Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Norway, and Quebec of Canada)
have proposed to ban sales of gas and diesel powered cars by 2050 [31].
Since March 2015, astronaut Scott Kelly had often posted photos of the planet
Earth on his Twitter account during his one-year mission at the International Space
Station (ISS). In January 2016, CNN’s chief medical correspondent Sanjay
Gupta asked Kelly to deﬁne the Earth’s condition as if it were a human body. Kelly
replied, “There are deﬁnitely parts of Asia, Central America that when you look at
them from space, you’re always looking through a haze of pollution. As far as the
atmosphere is concerned, and being able to see the surface, you know, I would say
deﬁnitely those areas that I mentioned look kind of sick. ... [The atmosphere]
deﬁnitely looks very, very fragile and just kind of like this thin ﬁlm, so it looks like
something that we deﬁnitely need to take care of” [32]. The hard question is how to
take good care of the planet Earth and its inhabitants.
In The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008), astrobiology professor Helen Benson
(Jennifer Connelly) demanded to know the intention of the alien named Klaatu
(Keanu Reeves) [33]:
Helen Benson: I need to know what’s happening.
Klaatu: This planet is dying. The human race is killing it.
Helen Benson: So you’ve come here to help us.
Klaatu: No, I didn’t.
Helen Benson: You said you came to save us.
Klaatu: I said I came to save the Earth.
Helen Benson: You came to save the Earth … from us? You came to save the Earth from
us!
3

Klaatu: We can’t risk the survival of this planet for the sake of one species.
Helen Benson: What are you saying?
Klaatu: If the Earth dies, you die. If you die, the Earth survives.
3.2
Can Google Solve Death?
The TIME Magazine cover on September 30, 2013 reads “Can Google Solve
Death? The search giant is launching a venture to extend the human life span. That
would be crazy—if it weren’t Google” [34] (see Fig. 3.3). In November 2014,
Fortune Magazine named Google cofounder Larry Page “the most ambitious CEO
in the universe” [35]. “The breadth of things that he is taking on is staggering,” said
Ben Horowitz, of Andreessen Horowitz. “We have not seen that kind of business
leader since Thomas Edison at GE or David Packard at HP.”
Google made its ﬁrst foray into healthcare with Google Health between 2008
and 2011 to collect volunteered information about personal health conditions,
medications, allergies, and lab results [36]. Larry Page has good reason for his deep
interest in health sciences. In May 2013, Page announced on his Google+ proﬁle

that a 1999 cold left him with paralysis of the left vocal cord, and another cold in
the previous summer paralyzed the right cord [37]. Business Insider reported that
Page has Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease in which the thyroid
gland is attacked by a variety of cell and antibody-mediated immune processes [38].
Undaunted, Page decided to go for the moonshot. “Are people really focused on
the right things?” he asked. “One of the things I thought was amazing is that if you
solve cancer, you’d add about 3 years to people’s average life expectancy. We think
of solving cancer as this huge thing that’ll totally change the world. But when you
really take a step back and look at it, yeah, there are many, many tragic cases of
cancer, and it’s very, very sad, but in the aggregate, it’s not as big an advance as
you might think” [39]. To see the forest for the trees, Figs. 3.4 and 3.5 show the
causes of death for female and male over a 100-year lifespan. Statistician Nathan
Yau compiled the stacked graphs using 2005–2014 data from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [40].
On September 18, 2013, Google unveiled a new venture—Calico—to tackle
human aging and associated diseases [41]. Led by its CEO Arthur D. Levinson,
Calico partners with AbbVie [42], University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center, 2M Companies [43], Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard [44], Buck
Institute for Research on Aging [45], QB3 [46], and AncestryDNA [47] to study
aging and ﬁnd cures for age-related diseases. “OK … so you’re probably thinking
wow! That’s a lot different from what Google does today,” Larry Page wrote about
Calico on Google+. “And you’re right. But as we explained in our ﬁrst letter to
shareholders, there’s tremendous potential for technology more generally to
improve people’s lives. So don’t be surprised if we invest in projects that seem
strange or speculative compared with our existing Internet businesses” [48].
On August 10, 2015, Larry Page announced the creation of a new public holding
company—Alphabet
(http://abc.xyz)—to
restructure
Google
by
moving
non-Internet subsidiaries from Google to Alphabet. In the ofﬁcial Google blog, Page
singled out “health efforts” as one of the main reasons for restructuring: “What is
Alphabet? Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of
course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that
are pretty far aﬁeld of our main Internet products contained in Alphabet instead. What
do we mean by far aﬁeld? Good examples are our health efforts: Life Sciences (that
works on the glucose-sensing contact lens), and Calico (focused on longevity)” [49].
Google Life Sciences, formerly a division of Google X, was renamed to Verily
in December 2015 as a subsidiary of Alphabet [50]. Since the development of
contact lens for diabetics to monitor glucose in tears, the company has been
researching cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mental health, just to name a few.
Verily chief medical ofﬁcer Dr. Jessica Mega described the need to create a baseline
human health by mining “deep molecular data, clinical data, imaging data and
patient engagement” that would help doctors to “understand more about a given
individual so they get the right treatment, get the right medications, and avoid the
side effects” [51]. The idea is to combine medicine, engineering, and data science in
an effort to capture the early signs of a disease and to stop it in its tracks. An
artiﬁcial intelligence program can do Google search at lightning speed, analyze a
118
N. Lee

mountain of research data, discover new patterns, connect the dots, and eventually
discover groundbreaking insights.
A comprehensive and well-understood baseline human health will enable sci-
entists to devise not only better diagnostic lab tests but also innovative health
monitoring applications. For example:
1. Whenever you take a selﬁe on your smartphone, a mobile app will analyze your
eyes, skin condition, and other facial features for any sign of abnormality that
may indicate certain illness. If one’s iris can be affected by systemic health,
iridology may see the light of day as being evidence-based rather than pseu-
doscientiﬁc (see Fig. 3.6).
2. When you talk on the phone, an app will analyze your voice and speech pattern
to determine your stress level, emotional state, and general health condition. It
will certainly know if you are catching a cold. (Computers are already capable
of reading a person’s body language to tell whether they are bored [52]) and
smartphones are being used to detect anemia and other medical conditions).
3. A discreet plug-in to any dating app will estimate the emotional intelligence/
quotient (EQ) and love compatibility of your new date (see Fig. 3.7). Enough said.
Interestingly, Verily has a staff philosopher among its 350 scientists, as CEO
Andy Conrad explained, “We have to understand the ‘why’ of what people do.
A philosopher might be as important as a chemist” [50].
The real solution to human longevity will likely involve both traditional and
alternative medicine, scientiﬁc and philosophical problem-solving, as well as big
data analysis and human intuition. The mysterious universe cannot be explained
from one angle alone; instead it requires multiple paradigms including Newtonian
physics, Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics. Taking into

account Kurt Gödel’s incompleteness theorems (see Fig. 3.8), a uniﬁed Theory of
Everything (ToE) may never be attainable (see Fig. 3.9). Similarly, there may not
be a magic pill but a holistic solution to human longevity.

Biblical Account of Human Lifespan
According to the Bible, Adam and Eve gave up eternal life to gain the knowledge of
good and evil. “The LORD God said, ‘The man has now become like one of us,
knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also
from the tree of life and eat, and live forever’” (Genesis 3:22). Altogether, Adam
lived a total of 930 years (Genesis 5:5). Enoch and Prophet Elijah were the only
two human beings who did not die but were instead taken away to heaven (Genesis
5:22–24 and 2 Kings 2:1–11). The average human lifespan at the time was close to
1,000 years. However, God decided to shorten the life expectancy to 120 years:
When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to
them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married
any of them they chose. Then the Lord said, “My Spirit will not contend with humans
forever, for they are mortal; their days will be a hundred and twenty years.” The Nephilim
were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the
daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of
renown. (Genesis 6:1–4)
The Nephilim—human-alien hybrid—could very well be the ancestors of people
with superhuman or psychic abilities. In the Book of Judges, Samson the Nazirite had
extraordinary physical strength. French apothecary Nostradamus became famous for
his prophecy and horoscopes in the 16th century even though skeptics dismissed his
work as retroactive clairvoyance or postdiction. At the end of World War II, Dutch
magician Mirin Dajo bafﬂed the medical community and astounded the audience by
impaling his body with bladed weapons without bleeding or feeling pain. Some
researchers call the deliberately caused bodily damage (DCBD) a metahypnotic
phenomenon. In more recent news, there are anecdotal reports of teenage girls lifting
up 3,000 lb of cars and trucks to save their family members [53–55].

Figuring out the mechanism behind a tenfold reduction of human lifespan from a
thousand years to a hundred years may provide important insights into human
longevity research. The human genome appears to have undergone three mutations
adversely affecting human lifespan: the ﬁrst was after Adam and Eve were banished
from the Garden of Eden, the second was after Noah and the Great Flood, and the
third was after Moses and the Exodus.
Figure 3.10 shows the lifespan of 26 prominent ﬁgures from Adam to Neil
Armstrong who all died of natural causes. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) reported in February 2016 that American men and women lived
28.2 fewer years than residents in other countries with similar economies, including
the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany. The average life expectancy for
American men and women are 76.4 and 81.2 years, respectively [56].
In Fig. 3.10, the estimated birth years for the biblical characters are based on the
data provided in the Jewish Virtual Library [57]. Given the scientiﬁc calculation of
an estimated 200,000 years of Homo sapiens roaming the Earth [58], the relatively
short history of biblical time supports the theory that the Scriptures focuses on only
one branch of the human family tree starting with Adam and Eve as the common
ancestors. Other branches of modern humans include Asians, Europeans, and

Selﬁsh Versus Selﬂess Question of Super Longevity
A Dying Matters survey in 2011 found that only 15 % of people want to live
forever [60]. The older the people are, the less desire they have for super longevity
or immortality: 12 % of over-65 year olds against 21 % of 18–24 year olds want to
live forever. There are a number of reasons for the surprisingly low numbers:
1. Declining Health—The elderly often have weakened immune system and are
more prone to serious illnesses. A Google search on “age related diseases”
returns cardiovascular disease, cancer, arthritis, dementia, cataract, osteoporosis,
diabetes, hypertension and Alzheimer’s disease (see Fig. 3.11). The incidence
of cancer, in particular, increases exponentially with age. Without a doubt, no
one wants to suffer forever. A 2013 study by the Stanford University School of
Medicine revealed that an overwhelming 88 % of the 1,081 physicians surveyed
would choose a do-not-resuscitate or “no code” order for themselves if they are
terminally ill, even though the same doctors tend to pursue aggressive,
life-prolonging treatment for patients facing the same prognosis [61]. When
Albert Einstein suffered an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 76, he was

articles followed by an excerpt from Disabled World about examples of aging-associated diseases

123

taken to the Princeton University Medical Center but he refused surgery, saying,
“I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artiﬁcially. I have done
my share, it is time to go. I will do it elegantly” [62]. Since Dr. Jack Kevorkian’s
“assisted suicide” movement in the 1990s, several states including California,
Oregon, Vermont, and Washington have passed a “right to die” legislation.
2. Life Dissatisfaction—Far too many people are getting tired of lifelong toil to
make ends meet or working at a job that they do not enjoy. Gallup polls con-
ducted between 2011 and 2016 have consistently shown that two-thirds of U.S.
employees are unhappy or disinterested at work [63]. San Diego State University
professor Jean Twenge has shown that anxiety and depression are on an 80-year
upswing for young Americans since 1935 [64]. The 1994 autobiography Prozac
Nation by Elizabeth Wurtzel and its 2001 ﬁlm adaption starring Christina Ricci
depict difﬁcult real life struggles confronting some teenagers. If people are afraid
to make positive changes to achieve life satisfaction (see Fig. 3.12), destructive
behaviors and death will eventually make the ﬁnal decision for them.
3. Status Quo—Society has taught its citizens to maintain the status quo: “There is
a place for everything and everything in its place.” Society generally accepts
advanced technologies to prolong human life, but eliminating death would
seriously disrupt the status quo. Overpopulation [65], food security [66], pen-
sion [67], capital punishment [68], and a host of other issues will need to be
reexamined. However, most people are averse to change.
4. Boredom—British journalist and author Bryan Appleyard expressed eloquently,
“I think there’s a point that the immortalists don’t understand, and it’s that one
Fig. 3.12 Google search on “life satisfaction” returns a Knowledge Graph of an excerpt from
Positive Psychology Program about one’s evaluation of life as a whole, rather than the feelings and
emotions that are experienced in the moment

exhausts one’s own personality over a certain period. It’s a weird idea that you
would go on and on, still being interested in being yourself. I don’t think anyone
would. I think you’d get excruciatingly bored of being yourself” [69]. My
response to Appleyard is that boredom often stems from the lack of desire to
reinvent oneself. To become a Renaissance man or woman, for instance, can
take an eternity. Understandably, not everyone wants to be a polymath, but there
are so many books to read, places to visit, ideas to share, new hobbies to
discover, and charities to volunteer for—the bucket list is practically endless. In
early 2016, bucketlist.org showcased more than 4 million life goals from over
300,000 members [70]. Life is anything but boring.
5. Misanthropy—I recently had a debate with some university students on their
pessimistic view that human beings are parasites on Earth, deriving natural
resources at the planet’s expense. Voluntary Human Extinction Movement
(VHEMT—pronounced vehement) is a radical environmental movement with
spokesperson Les Knight who believes that “When every human chooses to stop
breeding, Earth’s biosphere will be allowed to return to its former glory, and all
remaining creatures will be free to live, die, evolve (if they believe in evolution),
and will perhaps pass away, as so many of Nature’s ‘experiments’ have done
throughout the eons” [71]. Other Malthusians range from the moderate
Population Action International to the extreme Church of Euthanasia.
In Tarsem Singh’s visually stunning ﬁlm The Fall (2006), 5-year-old patient
Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) asked the bedridden stuntman Roy Walker (Lee Pace)
to tell her a story about her namesake. When the fantasy tale turned tragic,
Alexandria began to weep and a heart-wrenching dialogue emerged:
Alexandria: Why are you killing everybody? Why are you making everybody die?
Roy Walker: It’s my story.
Alexandria: Mine, too.
Roy ﬁnally came to realize that his self-pity and self-centeredness were hurting
an innocent child. A man’s selﬁshness is often metaphorically and sometimes
literally killing his family and friends. American author Og Mandino wrote in The
Greatest Miracle in the World: “Most humans, in varying degrees, are already dead.
In one way or another they have lost their dreams, their ambitions, their desire for a
better life. They have surrendered their ﬁght for self-esteem and they have com-
promised their great potential. They have settled for a life of mediocrity, days of
despair and nights of tears. They are no more than living deaths conﬁned to
cemeteries of their choice. Yet they need not remain in that state. They can be
resurrected from their sorry condition. They can each perform the greatest miracle
in the world. They can each come back from the dead…”
Whether the answer is a yes or a no, “Do I want to live forever?” is a somewhat
selﬁsh question symptomatic of the me generation who conveniently forgets that
their decisions affect other people as well.
On one hand, super longevity may create in people an aversion to risking one’s
life to save others. The Bible tells a story of King Hezekiah who begged God to cure
3
Google Versus Death; To Be, Or Not to Be?
125

his terminal illness and spare him from his imminent death. While enjoying his extra
15 years of life, Hezekiah showed off his immense wealth to the king of Babylon —
an action that proved to be disastrous. Hezekiah also fathered a son named
Manasseh, who later became king at age 12, did evil in the eyes of God, and led
Israel into ruin. The worst part was that Hezekiah did not seem to care as he thought
to himself, “Will there not be peace and security in my lifetime?” (2 Kings 20:19).
On the other hand, super longevity may motivate people to think very long-term,
protect the environment, recycle, prevent wars and destructions, and do everything
possible to achieve a better quality of life instead of leaving the world’s problems to
the next generation. Cofounded by Danny Hillis and Steward Brand in 1996, the
Long Now Foundation provides “a counterpoint to today’s accelerating culture,”
helps make “long-term thinking more common,” and fosters “responsibility in the
framework of the next 10,000 years” [72].
In my 2006 interview for the Association for Computing Machinery, my former
Disney colleague Danny Hillis elucidated his rationale, “The [10,000 Year Clock]
project is about my acknowledgement that I do have some relationships with people
thousands of years from now, and there is some continuity between what I do and
what their life will be. … The business of making people think long-term is really
something that is missing in the world in general. So we started a foundation that
does the clock project and other projects for basically stretching out people’s sense
of the moment that they care about—which is now—that’s why we call it the Long
Now Foundation. It is actually Brian Eno’s suggestion that we want to stretch out
the moment of now to include the next 10,000 years” [73] (see Fig. 3.13).
A selﬂess question of immortality may be more along the lines of “Do I want
someone else to live forever?” That someone may be a spouse, parent, child, or
even friend.
In December 2007, Boy Scout leader Tim Billups donated one of his kidneys to
Scout leader Mel Northington and saved his life. “It serves as an example, because in
any kind of society you have to think of yourself as ﬁtting into a larger picture,” said
Mike Andrews, scoutmaster of Troop 500. “What an unselﬁsh act for Tim to do this.
Tim knows Mel through Scouting. It’s not like he’s a family member or a boyhood
friend who grew up with him. It’s very humbling” [74]. Should Tim’s lone remaining
kidney ever fail, his brother John Billups has promised to donate one of his.
Since the ﬁrst issue of Computers in Entertainment published by the Association
of Computing Machinery in October 2003, the list of “In Memoriam” for the
magazine’s editorial board has sadly gotten longer. Amongst them are Charles
Swartz, Randy Pausch, Roy E. Disney, and Bob Lambert [75]:
• Charles Swartz was CEO of Entertainment Technology Center at the University
of Southern California where his Digital Cinema Lab became Hollywood’s de
facto digital cinema forum [76]. He lost his battle with brain cancer at age 68.
• Randy Pausch was associate professor of computer science, human-computer
interaction, and design as well as a cofounder of Entertainment Technology Center
at Carnegie Mellon University [77]. Pancreatic cancer took his life at age 47.

Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994), and
Fantasia 2000 (1999) [78, 79]. He died of stomach cancer at age 79.
• Bob Lambert was a senior executive at The Walt Disney Company and founder
of Digital Cinema Initiatives that help U.S. theaters transition from celluloid to
digital [80]. He passed away at age 55.
When I requested an interview with Prof. Pausch in October 2007, he replied to
my email, “I’m afraid I’ll have to decline; time is just in short supply for me, as I’m
sure you can understand.”
3.5
Precious Commodity of Time
Time is the most precious commodity. Time does not discriminate based on race,
gender, sexual orientation, physical features, and socioeconomic status.
Noted for its 1 min and 42 s of hypnotizing and long intro, Pink Floyd’s Time
from their 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon reminds listeners that “you are
young and life is long and there is time to kill today, and then one day you ﬁnd ten
years have got behind you, … and you run and you run to catch up with the sun but
it’s sinking, … you’re older, shorter of breath and one day closer to death” [81].
When people look back on their lives, they often wish that they had spent more time
with their families, less arguing and more forgiving, less ﬁghting and more peace.
The most precious thing that people can give to one another is time.
In 1748 Benjamin Franklin, a Founding Father of the United States and the face
on the one hundred-dollar bill since 1928, coined the phrase “Time is Money” in his
essay Advice to a Young Tradesman [82]. In the 2011 sci-ﬁmovie In Time, people
are genetically engineered to stop aging at 25 years old, and time is literally money
because currency is measured in hours and minutes instead of dollars and cents [83].
People would use time as currency to pay for daily expenses. Factory worker Will
Salas (Justin Timberlake) ran into a 105-year-old young man Henry Hamilton (Matt
Bomer) who transferred 116 years of his time to Will, leaving himself with only
5 min to live. Will in turn gave some of his newly acquired time to his best friend
Borel (Johnny Galecki) who tragically ended up dying prematurely due to alcohol
intoxication. If the meaning of life is futility, human longevity loses its luster.
In 2016, Bill and Melinda Gates were asked by some high school students in
Kentucky what superpower they wished they could have. Their answers were:
“More time. More energy. As superpowers go, they may not be as exciting as
Superman’s ability to defy gravity. But if the world can put more of both into the
hands of the poorest, we believe it will allow millions of dreams to take ﬂight” [84].
In his 2007 “Last Lecture” titled “Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams,”
Prof. Randy Pausch said, “We cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we
play the hand. … It’s a thrill to fulﬁll your own childhood dreams, but as you get
older, you may ﬁnd that enabling the dreams of others is even more fun” [85].

Negligible Senescence and Princess Leia in Star Wars
In 2014 HuffPost Women listed 5 things that women are judged more harshly for
than men: “Having ‘too many’ sexual partners, having a messy home, being over-
weight, being blunt or assertive, and not having children” [86]. Some ﬁlm critics
deemed Jennifer Lawrence too fat to play Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games
[87]. British model Iskra Lawrence was called a “fat cow,” Melissa McCarthy a
“female hippo,” and Kate Upton a “squishy brick” [88]. Carrie Fisher was pressured
to lose 35 lb prior to the start of ﬁlming Star Wars: The Force Awakens [89]. To add
insult to injury, Internet trolls bashed Fisher for her aging looks.
In Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), 59-year-old Carrie Fisher reprised her
role as Princess Leia turned General Organa. While no one complained about Han
Solo played by 73-year-old Harrison Ford, gender bias reared its ugly head when
Internet trolls criticized Princess Leia’s appearance: “You didn’t age well and u
sucked in Star Wars” [90]. Fisher ﬁred back at the body-shaming trolls: “Please stop
debating about whether or not I aged well. Unfortunately it hurts all 3 of my
feelings. My body hasn’t aged as well as I have. Blow us. … Youth & beauty are
not accomplishments, they’re the temporary happy byproducts of time and/or

DNA” (see Fig. 3.14). A Fisher supporter tweeted, “Men don’t age better than
women, they’re just allowed to age” (see Fig. 3.15).
In gerontology, scientists have been researching negligible senescence—the lack
of symptoms of aging (see Fig. 3.16). There are quite a number of negligibly
senescent animals in nature. Adwaita was a tortoise in Calcutta, India that lived to
either 150 or 250 years old by some accounts [91]. George, a 140-year-old lobster,
was released back into the wild by a New York restaurant [92]. Henry, a New Zealand
reptile, became a father at the age of 111 for the ﬁrst time [93]. Prof. Caleb Finch of
USC Davis School of Gerontology said in a 2010 interview, “In theory, if mortality
rates did not increase as usual during aging, humans would live hundreds of years.
I have calculated for humans that at mortality rates of 0.05 % per year, as found at age
15 in developed countries, the median lifespan would be about 1,200 years. In
natural populations of long-lived animals, mortality rates are rarely less than 1 % per
year. For very slowly aging turtles, rockﬁsh, the number beyond 70 is 1–2 %.
However, there are long-lived trees, like the bristlecone pine at 5,000 years” [94].
On the eve of his 69th birthday, biochemist-geneticist Craig Venter declared, “I
have the brain of a 44-year-old. … It’s not just a long life we’re striving for, but one
which is worth living” [95]. Venter has been acknowledged, along with geneticist
Francis Sellers Collins, as being a primary force behind the Human Genome Project
[96]. In 2013, Venter launched Human Longevity, Inc (HLI) with stem cell pioneer
Robert Hariri and XPRIZE Foundation founder Peter Diamandis. “Using the
combined power of our core areas of expertise—genomics, informatics, and stem
cell therapies, we are tackling one of the greatest medical/scientiﬁc and societal
challenges—aging and aging related diseases,” Venter elaborated his company
vision. “HLI is going to change the way medicine is practiced by helping to shift to
a more preventive, genomic-based medicine model which we believe will lower
healthcare costs. Our goal is not necessarily lengthening life, but extending a
healthier, high performing, more productive life span” [97]. Baylor College of
Medicine professor C. Thomas Caskey agreed, “The whole idea behind this is to
identify the risk, then modify that risk so that you end up with longer periods of
normal health. … The patient does not want just more years but quality years” [95].

Rejuvenation and the Curious Case of Benjamin
Button
Rumors of a Fountain of Youth (see Fig. 3.17) have endured from Alexander the
Great in the 4th century B.C. to legendary patriarch king Prester John during the
early Christian Crusades to Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León in 1513 when he
discovered Florida.
Biomedical gerontologist Aubrey de Grey cofounded the SENS (Strategies for
Engineered Negligible Senescence) Research Foundation in 2009 to conduct
research on regenerative medicine and rejuvenation biotechnologies to prevent or
reverse the aging process [98]. de Grey said in a 2013 interview, “SENS is based on
3
Google Versus Death; To Be, Or Not to Be?
131

the appreciation that there is a continuum between (a) the initially harmless, pro-
gressively accumulating damage that accumulates in the body as a side-effect of its
normal operation and (b) the pathologies that emerge when the amount of that
damage exceeds what the body is set up to tolerate. We want to treat (remove or
obviate) the damage and thereby prevent the pathology” [99].
Regenerative medicine can take its cue from salamanders (Ambystoma mexi-
canum) that can routinely regenerate complex tissues such as a severed limb, a
detached tail, or the lens and retina of a damaged eye (see Fig. 3.18). Northeastern
University Professor James Monaghan and his research team studied limb regen-
eration in salamanders and concluded that “many new candidate gene sequences
were discovered for the ﬁrst time and these will greatly enable future studies of
wound healing, epigenetics, genome stability, and nerve-dependent blastema for-
mation and outgrowth using the axolotl model” [100].
Rejuvenation biotechnologies can pick up on the immortal jellyﬁsh (Turritopsis
dohrnii) that can age backward like Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) in The Curious
Case of Benjamin Button (2008) (see Fig. 3.19). When starvation or injury occurs,
“instead of sure death, [Turritopsis] transforms all of its existing cells into a
younger state,” said Maria Pia Miglietta, then postdoctoral scholar at Pennsylvania
State University and now professor at Texas A&M University at Galveston [101].
The immortal jellyﬁsh can rejuvenate from an adult back into a baby, converting
muscle cells into nerve cells, sperms, or eggs. The life cycle repeats itself until the
jellyﬁsh gets eaten by a predator or succumbs to illness.

The Man with the Golden Arm Helped Save 2 Million
Babies
Sometimes we need to look no further than our own human species for miraculous
power of healing. 78-year-old James Harrison has donated blood plasma from his
right arm almost every week for the past 60 years. The unusual antibody in his
blood has saved the lives of more than 2 million babies from rhesus disease. Thanks
to Harrison, doctors were able to use his antibodies to develop Anti-D, an injection
Fig. 3.18 Google search on “salamander” returns a Knowledge Graph of a deﬁnition from
Wikipedia along with pictures and other scientiﬁc details
3

133

that prevents women with rhesus-negative blood from developing RhD antibodies
during pregnancy.
“Australia was one of the ﬁrst countries to discover a blood donor with this
antibody, so it was quite revolutionary at the time,” said Jemma Falkenmire of the
Australian Red Cross Blood Service in a 2015 interview on CNN. “In Australia, up
until about 1967, there were literally thousands of babies dying each year, doctors
didn’t know why, and it was awful. Women were having numerous miscarriages
and babies were being born with brain damage. … Every bag of blood is precious,
but James’ blood is particularly extraordinary. His blood is actually used to make a
life-saving medication, given to moms whose blood is at risk of attacking their
unborn babies. Every batch of Anti-D that has ever been made in Australia has
come from James’ blood. … I’m grateful and I think James is really selﬂess to
continue to donate, so that we can keep having this vaccine. … He will have to

retire in the next couple years, and I guess for us the hope is there will be people
who will donate, who will also … have this antibody and become life savers in the
same way he has, and all we can do is hope there will be people out there generous
enough to do it, and selﬂessly in the way he’s done” [102].
3.9
The Man Who Can’t Catch AIDS Helped Develop
Anti-Viral Drugs
Touted as “the man who can’t catch AIDS,” New York artist and Fodor’s travel
guides editor Stephen Crohn had a genetic mutation in his white blood cells (CD4+ T
helper cells) that effectively blocked HIV infection (see Fig. 3.20). He volunteered
for research studies that shed light on the nature of AIDS and led to the development
of antiviral drugs at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center and other medical
facilitates. His great-uncle was gastroenterologist Burrill Bernard Crohn who dis-
covered the inﬂammatory bowel syndrome named Crohn’s disease [103].
“One of the things that went through my mind was, ‘I guess I’m condemned to
live,’” said Crohn. “What’s hard is living with the continuous grief. You keep
losing people every year—six people, seven people … and it goes on for such a
long period of time. And the only thing you could compare it to would be to be in a
war” [104]. Overcome by survivor guilt after seeing more than 70 of his friends
died of AIDS, Crohn committed suicide at age 66. Stephen Crohn could have lived
a long and healthy life, but he chose to die instead. Emotional health is just as
important as physical health.

No Mother Should Bury Their Child
Sponsored by the 501(c) (3) nonproﬁt Institute for Education, Research, and
Scholarships (IFERS), EASE T1D (Education, Awareness, Support, Empowerment
for Type 1 Diabetes) is the joint effort of two mothers—Debbie George
and
Michelle Thornburg—who have children with Type 1 diabetes [105]. EASE T1D
addresses the misconceptions of Type 1 diabetes and the lack of knowledge on the
differences between Type 1 (little to no insulin) and Type 2 (insulin resistance, too
little insulin). Type 1 diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening autoimmune disease for
which there is currently no cure. Contrary to popular belief, diet and lifestyle are not
causes of the disease.
Undiagnosed Type 1 diabetes can result in Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) which
can lead to serious conditions including coma, brain damage, and even death. With
the slogan “No parent should bury their child,” EASE T1D started a petition in May
2015 to encourage physicians, physician assistants, and nurses in California to
educate parents on the signs and symptoms of Type 1 diabetes as well as to check
blood glucose levels of children and adults who present ﬂu-like symptoms in an
effort to prevent a misdiagnosis and to save lives. This legislation is modeled after
Reegan’s Rule.
Reegan’s Rule was started in North Carolina by a mother whose 16-month-old
baby girl, Reegan Oxendine, passed away from undiagnosed Type 1 diabetes. Little
Reegan had been misdiagnosed several times over a 3-month period before her
death. Reegan’s mother, Darice Oxendine, created a legislation to encourage parent
education on Type 1 diabetes during well-child care visits from birth to age 5 years
old. The ﬁrst-of-its-kind legislation was signed into North Carolina Law in October
2015 [106].
Advocacy efforts for similar legislation have been happening nationwide. In
November 2015, House Resolution No. 569 passed in Pennsylvania due to the
efforts of Debbie Healy and her State Representative, Ryan MacKenzie. The res-
olution encourages physicians to educate and discuss the warning signs and
symptoms of Type 1 diabetes with parents or guardians [107].
In March 2016, California Senator Richard D. Roth’s measure to raise awareness
of Type 1 diabetes passed the State Senate on a bipartisan, unanimous vote of 38-0
(see Fig. 3.21). “I am proud to have authored Senate Resolution 63 and thank my
colleagues in the State Senate for joining me in raising awareness of this life
threatening disease,” said Senator Roth. “Educating parents regarding Type 1
diabetes is critical to diagnosing and treating this condition early and effectively,
helping ensure children and adolescents learn to manage their condition and live
long, healthy lives” [108].
With all the grassroots awareness campaigns spearheaded by concerned parents,
some promising solutions are on the horizon. Partnering with Dr. Jane Buckner of
Benaroya Research Institute (BRI) at Virginia Mason, Dr. David Rawlings and his
team at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute have been studying an im-
munotherapy approach. “In Type 1 diabetes, a type of immune system cell, called

137

an effector T cell, malfunctions and attacks pancreas cells that create insulin,”
Rawlings explained. “Normally, effector T cells attack foreign viruses, not the
body’s own cells. With this research, we will edit genes in these cells and change
these ‘dangerous’ cells into regulatory T cells, another type of immune cell that
regulates an immune system’s response and keeps it from going into overdrive. We
expect these gene-edited regulatory T cells, when returned to a diabetic’s body, will
stop effector T cells from destroying the body’s insulin-producing cells” [109].
Clinical trials for new treatments have already begun. In June 2015,
Massachusetts General Hospital launched phase II trial of vaccine bacillus
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) to reverse advanced Type 1 diabetes [110]. In March 2016,
Professor Mark Peakman at King’s College London started testing MultiPepT1De
(Multiple beta cell Peptides in Type 1 diabetes) injections on trial participants. The
peptides are protein molecules found in the insulin-producing beta cells of the
pancreas (see Fig. 3.22). Researchers hope that the peptides will re-train the
patient’s immune system to get rid of its autoimmune disorder.
Although researchers have been making steady progress, fundraising to support
them is not easy. Once in a blue moon there are successful campaigns like the Ice
Bucket Challenge by the ALS Association to ﬁght Lou Gehrig’s disease (see
Fig. 3.23). However, the majority of people in the world could care less about
diabetes, cancer, or any incurable disease unless they are inﬂicted by it or they have
to take care of a family member who is suffering from it. The public generally relies
on deep-pocketed pharmaceutical companies to fund expensive research which

often results in high drug prices. The Wall Street Journal reported that in 2014 the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 41 new drugs, the most in
nearly two decades, but the catch is their cost [111]:
Recent treatments for hepatitis C, cancer and multiple sclerosis that cost from $50,000
annually to well over $100,000 helped drive up total U.S. prescription-drug spending
12.2 % in 2014, ﬁve times the prior year’s growth rate… Out-of-pocket prescription-drug
costs rose 2.7 % in 2014. … Even patients with insurance and comfortable incomes are
sometimes forced to make hard choices—tapping savings, taking on new debt or even
forgoing treatment. … Patients on Medicare are starting to feel some relief from
out-of-pocket expenses through a provision in the Affordable Care Act that requires a
gradual lowering of patient contributions.
In 2015, the U.S. government spent 28.7 % of taxpayer’s money on health
programs (see Fig. 3.24) [112]. The second largest spending was 25.4 % on the
Pentagon and the military. A healthy population is vital to a country’s economy and
national security.

Big Data for “Nowcasting” of Epidemics
“One in 20 Google searches are for health-related information,” wrote Google
product manager Prem Ramaswami in the Google ofﬁcial blog in February 2015
[113]. Instead of calling doctors at the ﬁrst sign of symptoms, people turn to Google
search for help. So much so that Google can predict where and when an epidemic
will occur based on geographical data and search queries.
In 2008, Google engineers started working on Flu Trends. It turned out to be a
big data success story of “nowcasting” which aims to offer near-term forecast with a
high degree of detail and accuracy. During the 2012–2013 season in the United
States, Google Flu Trends correctly estimated the start and duration of the season,
but overestimated the severity of the ﬂu [114]. Then Google software engineer
Jeremy Ginsberg and his research team cautioned that “this system is not designed
to be a replacement for traditional surveillance networks or supplant the need for
laboratory-based diagnoses and surveillance” [115].
In 2015, Google Flu Trends and Google Dengue Trends stopped publishing
estimates of ﬂu and dengue fever based on search patterns. Instead, Google began to
provide ﬂu and dengue signal data directly to Columbia University’s Mailman
School of Public Health, Boston Children’s Hospital/Harvard, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) Inﬂuenza Division, and other institutions that spe-
cialize in infectious disease research [116].

Top 10 Lists of Health-Related Search Queries
According to Simon Rogers, a data editor for Google’s News Lab, the top 9
health-related questions on Google search in the United States from January to
November 2015 were [117]:
1. Is bronchitis contagious?
2. Is pneumonia contagious?
3. How much water should I drink?
4. How many calories should I eat?
5. What is lupus?
6. How far along am I?
7. When do you ovulate?
8. What is gluten?
9. How long does the ﬂu last?
Megan Ranney, Content Marketing Manager at Mashable, reported on countries
using Google search to eat and live healthier in 2015. She summarized in her article
that “how to eat healthy, healthy body mass index parameters, how to lose weight
and how to eat healthy on a budget all ranked among the world’s top 10 search
3
Google Versus Death; To Be, Or Not to Be?
141

queries, as well as questions about whether speciﬁc foods were healthy” [118]. The
worldwide top 10 health-related queries in 2015 were:
1. How to eat healthy
2. What is health?
3. Is [food] healthy? (Some foods listed were sushi, hummus, and popcorn)
4. How can I be healthy?
5. What is a healthy BMI?
6. How to stay healthy
7. How to lose weight
8. How to eat healthy on a budget
9. What is a healthy blood pressure?
10. What is a healthy heart rate?
3.13
Knowledge Graph of Health Information
Knowledge Graph is Google’s “ﬁrst step towards building the next generation of
search, which taps into the collective intelligence of the web and understands the
world a bit more like people do” [119]. In February 2015, Google product manager
Prem Ramaswami announced the expansion of Knowledge Graph to cover
health-related search queries [120]:
One in 20 Google searches are for health-related information. And you should ﬁnd the
health information you need more quickly and easily. … When you ask Google about
common health conditions, you’ll start getting relevant medical facts right up front from the
Knowledge Graph. We’ll show you typical symptoms and treatments, as well as details on
how common the condition is—whether it’s critical, if it’s contagious, what ages it affects,
and more. For some conditions you’ll also see high-quality illustrations from licensed
medical illustrators. Once you get this basic info from Google, you should ﬁnd it easier to
do more research on other sites around the web, or know what questions to ask your doctor.
Larry Page and Sergey Brin wrote in the August 2004 Google IPO letter that
Google users trust the search engine to help them with important decisions
including medical advice and that Google search results are unbiased and objective
[121]. Google relies on its team of medical doctors and the Mayo Clinic to ensure
the quality of medical information:
We worked with a team of medical doctors (led by our own Dr. Kapil Parakh, M.D., MPH,
Ph.D.) to carefully compile, curate, and review this information. All of the gathered facts
represent real-life clinical knowledge from these doctors and high-quality medical sources
across the web, and the information has been checked by medical doctors at Google and the
Mayo Clinic for accuracy.
For instance, when we Google “Type 1 diabetes” we get a Knowledge Graph of
“About,” “Symptoms,” and “Treatments” from Mayo Clinic and other sources (see
Figs. 3.25, 3.26, and 3.27). Although the Knowledge Graph is very useful, it is by
no means comprehensive or inclusive of all types of treatment, new theories, and

modern advances. Nevertheless, the Knowledge Graph provides adequate basic
information and offers additional search queries such as “Carbohydrate counting“
and “Diabetic diet“ to help users explore related topics. To cure Type 1 diabetes and
other serious hereditary diseases (see Fig. 3.28), advanced medical treatments such
as gene therapy offer promising solutions.

CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing
In 2012, biochemist Jennifer Doudna, microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier, and
their team of scientists published a seminal research paper on CRISPR-Cas9
(Clustered Regularly-Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats—CRISPR associated
protein 9) which allows scientists to edit genomes with precision, efﬁciency, and
ﬂexibility (see Fig. 3.29) [122].
In 2013, Chinese scientists Yuyu Niu, Bin Shen, Yiqiang Cui, Yongchang Chen,
and others at Yunnan Key Laboratory of Primate Biomedical Research and Nanjing
Medical University created the ﬁrst-ever mutant twin cynomolgus monkeys by
coinjection of one-cell-stage embryos with Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAs (see
Fig. 3.30) [123].
In 2014, Temple University professor Wenhui Hu and his collaborators at Case
Western Reserve University and Sichuan University successfully used RNA-
directed gene editing to eradicate latently infected cells and to immunize uninfected
cells against HIV-1 infection [124].
In 2015, Prof. Junjiu Huang and his research team at the Sun Yat-sen University
in Guangzhou, China modiﬁed the DNA of human embryos in order to eliminate
the inherited blood disease thalassemia [125]. “I believe this is the ﬁrst report of
CRISPR/Cas9 applied to human pre-implantation embryos and as such the study is
a landmark, as well as a cautionary tale,” said George Daley, a stem-cell biologist at
Harvard Medical School. “Their study should be a stern warning to any practitioner
who thinks the technology is ready for testing to eradicate disease genes” [126].

In 2016, the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority (HFEA) regulator
in the United Kingdom approved a license application by stem cell scientist Kathy
Niakan at the Francis Crick Institute in London to perform gene editing on human
embryos [127]. “This research will allow scientists to reﬁne the techniques for
creating GM (genetically modiﬁed) babies,” said Dr. David King, director of
Human Genetics Alert. “Many of the government’s scientiﬁc advisers have already
decided that they are in favor of allowing that. So this is the ﬁrst step in a well
mapped-out process leading to GM babies, and a future of consumer eugenics”
[128].
It may come as a surprise to many people that the human genome (see Fig. 3.31)
contains human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) (see Fig. 3.32) that are linked to
cancer [129], autoimmune diseases [130], multiple sclerosis [131], schizophrenia
[132], and more. Gene editing offers a new hope to eradicating many deadly
hereditary diseases. Christoph Lahtz, former cancer researcher at the City of Hope
Beckman Research Institute, describes gene editing as a new hope for cancer
treatment in Chap. 20 of this book.

Human-Animal Chimeras
In Greek mythology, the chimera was a ﬁre-breathing female monster with a lion’s
head, a goat’s body, and a serpent’s tail (see Fig. 3.33). Researchers of
human-animal chimeras attempt to grow human organs inside pigs and other farm
animals that can be harvested for transplantation. Using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing,
scientists ﬁrst remove the animal embryo’s capability to develop a certain organ (for
example, the pancreas). Then they insert human stem cells into the animal embryo,
in hopes that a normal human pancreas will be developed inside the animal.

Both human and pig genomes contain endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) (see
Fig. 3.32). The porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) can produce full-blown
viruses that infect both pig and human cells, rendering the organs unsuitable for
transplantation. In a 2015 landmark study, Harvard Medical School professor
George Church and his colleagues successfully used one CRISPR molecule to alter
all 62 genes in a pig cell to get rid of PERVs without damaging normal cell growth
[133].
“This work brings us closer to a realization of a limitless supply of safe,
dependable pig organs for transplant,” said Prof. David Dunn at the State University
of New York at Oswego. “It’s a cruel situation currently, that someone who needs a
heart transplant has to pin their chance for a healthy life on the untimely death of
another person” [134].

In a 2016 Scientiﬁc American interview, Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte at the
Salk Institute spoke of Pope Francis’ blessing of his work as well as the technical
and ethical challenges of human-animal chimeras [135]:
The Vatican is behind this research and has no problem based on the idea to help
humankind. And in theory all that we will be doing is killing pigs. One problem and the
major problem is that these [human] cells could colonize the brain of the animal in which
you put them. And obviously it would not be appropriate to have an animal with neurons
from people. Or these cells could colonize the germline so that the sperm or the oocytes of
that pig would be human. So to avoid that the government of Spain allowed us to have the
pig be born and then immediately after to be sacriﬁced. … We are devising genetic
engineering technology so that if a cell becomes a neuron it is just destroyed in the embryo.
Any cell that starts to be taught okay you are going to become a neuron at the moment of
the ﬁrst stages of neurogenesis, we are putting a toxin construct in it so that it will be
destroyed by itself. So that will prevent any pig embryos from having human neurons so to
speak.

3D Bioprinting of Tissues and Organs
For human-animal chimeras, mammals have their gestation periods before the
organs can be harvested for transplantation. 3D bioprinting using living cells is an
alternative to waiting for gestation. Scientists have succeeded in the generation and
transplantation of tissues including multilayered skin, bone tissue, vascular grafts,
tracheal splints, heart tissue, and cartilaginous structures [136]. Bioprinting of
complex organs such as kidneys and livers is in its early stage of development
[137].
“We present an Integrated Tissue-Organ Printer (ITOP) that can fabricate stable,
human-scale tissue constructs of any shape,” Dr. Anthony Atala at the Wake Forest
University Institute for Regenerative Medicine explained. “The correct shape of a
tissue construct is obtained from a human body by processing Computed
Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data in computer-aided
design software. … We are actually printing the scaffolds and the cells together. We
show that we can grow muscle. We make ears the size of baby ears. We make
jawbones the size of human jawbones. We are printing all kinds of things” [138].
In November 2015, Russian scientists Elena Bulanova, Vladimir Mironov, and
their research team 3D-printed a thyroid gland and transplanted it into a living
mouse to restore its thyroid function [139].

Cyborg: Cybernetic Implants and Nanobot Repairs
Arne Larsson was the ﬁrst “cyborg” who in 1958 received the world’s ﬁrst
implanted heart pacemaker to regulate his heartbeat [140]. He lived until the age of
86 when he died of melanoma skin cancer. Today there are over 3 million people
worldwide with artiﬁcial cardiac pacemakers [141]. Other common medical
implants include artiﬁcial hips, artiﬁcial knees, spinal fusion hardware, intra-uterine
devices (IUDs), traumatic fracture repair, coronary stents, ear tubes (tympanostomy
tubes), artiﬁcial eye lenses (psuedophakos), and implantable cardioverter deﬁbril-
lators (ICDs) [142].
In 2016, Prof. Thomas J. Oxley and his team at the University of Melbourne
developed a device dubbed “stentrode” that can be implanted into a patient’s brain
through blood vessels to make it easier to control artiﬁcial limbs from the brain
[143]. Without the need for invasive brain surgery, stentroide represents a signiﬁ-
cant advancement in the ﬁeld of brain-computer interface (BCI). The Six Million
Dollar Man (played by Lee Majors) and The Bionic Woman (starring Lindsay
Wagner) in the 70s TV series gave a positive glimpse into the future of cyborgs.

Nanobots are machines or robots at or close to the microscopic scale of a
nanometer (see Fig. 3.34). In a 2009 interview with Computerworld, futurist Ray
Kurzweil spoke about using nanotechnology and biotechnology to wipe out dis-
eases. “It’s radical life extension,” Kurzweil predicted. “The full realization of
nanobots will basically eliminate biological disease and aging. I think we’ll see
widespread use in 20 years of [nanotech] devices that perform certain functions for
us. In 30 or 40 years, we will overcome disease and aging. The nanobots will scout
out organs and cells that need repairs and simply ﬁx them. It will lead to profound
extensions of our health and longevity” [144].
When tissue damage results in bleeding, polymerized ﬁbrin and platelets form a
hemostatic plug or clot over a wound site. If the injury is too severe, however,
nanobots will come to the rescue by repairing the damage. All surgeries will be
performed by nanobots with precision and speed necessary to save a life in an
emergency situation.
T cells, B cells, and antibodies protect the human body against pathogens such
as bacteria and viruses. People get sick easier when their immune system is
weakened. Vaccines help to train T cells to recognize certain known pathogens.
Genetically modiﬁed T cells can cure melanoma skin cancer [145], which could
have saved Arne Larsson. With machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence, nano-
bots will be able to identify and annihilate any never-seen-before pathogens and
cancer cells.

Artiﬁcial Intelligence and IBM Watson DeepQA
In 1955, American computer scientist and cognitive scientist John McCarthy coined
the term “artiﬁcial intelligence” (AI) to describe “the science and engineering of
making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs” [146]. In
1965, IBM CEO Thomas J. Watson, Jr. predicted that “the widespread use [of
computers]…in hospitals and physicians’ ofﬁces will instantaneously give a doctor
or a nurse a patient’s entire medical history, eliminating both guesswork and bad
recollection, and sometimes making a difference between life and death” [147].
In early 1970s at Stanford University, doctoral student Edward Shortliffe
developed MYCIN—a rule-based artiﬁcial intelligence expert system that outper-
formed human physicians in diagnosing patients and recommending treatments for
severe infections such as bacteremia and meningitis [148].
In 1980s at Virginia Tech, I developed an expert system for information on
pharmacology and drug interactions, which led to my ﬁrst peer-reviewed research
paper, published in the journal Computers in Biology and Medicine [149]. The
expert system organizes and encodes pharmacological information in rules and
frames for systematic retrieval which includes delineation, deﬁnition, and hierar-
chical subdivision of mechanisms responsible for drug interactions; division of
pharmacological agents into a hierarchy of subclasses to allow for deﬁning inter-
acting drugs by classes as well as by speciﬁc agents; and correlation of drug classes
and speciﬁc drugs with mechanisms by which they may be involved in drug
interactions. Clinicians use the expert system to predict what may happen when two
drugs are used together, how drugs interact in the human body, what can be done to
alleviate detrimental side effects, and what related drugs may also be involved in
similar interactions.
In a highly publicized Jeopardy! game shows on television in February 2011,
IBM Watson DeepQA defeated human champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter
[150]. “People ask me if this is HAL,” said David Ferrucci, lead developer of
Watson, referring to the Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic (HAL) computer
in 2001: A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke. “HAL’s not
the focus; the focus is on the computer on ‘Star Trek,’ where you have this intel-
ligent information seeking dialogue, where you can ask follow-up questions and the
computer can look at all the evidence and tries to ask follow-up questions. That’s
very cool” [151].
Inspired by IBM Watson on Jeopardy!, author Martin Ford penned a piece in
The Atlantic with the sensational title “Anything You Can Do, Robots Can Do
Better” and he asked the question “Is any job safe from automation?” [152] The
answer is an unequivocal no in the long run. In fact, given the chance to let
machines do the job, Google cofounder Larry Page believes that nine out of 10
people “wouldn’t want to be doing what they’re doing today” [153].
Shortly after winning Jeopardy!, IBM Watson began to learn how to make
diagnoses and treatment recommendations at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York. “The process of pulling out two key facts from a Jeopardy
154
N. Lee

clue is totally different from pulling out all the relevant information, and its rela-
tionships, from a medical case,” said Ari Caroline, Sloan-Kettering’s director of
quantitative analysis and strategic initiatives. “Sometimes there is conﬂicting
information. People phrase things in different ways” [154].
The voluminous amount of structured and unstructured health information calls
for the need of big data scientists to build models to explain and predict patterns.
Once again, artiﬁcial intelligence has outperformed human researchers. In 2015,
MIT’s Data Science Machine can create accurate predictive models from raw
datasets within 2–12 h whereas a team of human data scientists can take months
[155].
In 2016, artiﬁcial intelligence is assisting radiologists to identify cancer and
other medical abnormalities in X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs [156]. “There are a lot
of advances in facial recognition that we wanted to adapt to medicine because it’s
about determining where the nodules, aneurysms, and things like that are,” said
Columbia University student researcher Jeet Samarth Raut whose mother was
misdiagnosed by radiologists about a rare kind of breast cancer [157]. Artiﬁcial
intelligence is becoming an indispensable tool in advancing medical science and
technology.
At the TED2016 conference, IBM announced the IBM Watson AI XPRIZE
which offers $5 million to the winning team. “Our hope is that the teams will show
how we can apply AI to the world’s great challenges,” said Stephanie Wander of
the XPRIZE Foundation. “That would be the cat’s meow” [158].
At the 2016 Google I/O developer conference, Google senior vice president of
infrastructure Urs Holzle revealed the deployment of thousands of specialized
artiﬁcial intelligence chips—TensorFlow Processing Units (TPUs)—in servers
within Google’s data centers [159]. TensorFlow is an open source software library
for machine learning, originally developed by the Google Brain Team for use in
speech recognition, Gmail, Google Photos, Google Search, and other Google
products [160].

Human-Machine Symbiosis and Google DeepMind
In 1960, MIT psychologist and computer scientist J. C. R. Licklider laid the
foundation of man-computer symbiosis which led to interactive computing,
graphical user interface, the Internet, and today’s digital era.
In October 2007, Stanford University’s Folding@home project received a
Guinness World Record for topping 1 petaﬂop (a thousand trillion ﬂoating point
operations per second) running on computers as well as Sony’s PlayStation 3 video
game consoles [161]. Folding@home helps scientists study protein folding and its
relationship to Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, and cancerous diseases [162]: “Foldit
attempts to predict the structure of a protein by taking advantage of humans’
puzzle-solving intuitions and having people play competitively to fold the best
proteins. Since proteins are part of so many diseases, they can also be part of the
3
Google Versus Death; To Be, Or Not to Be?
155

cure. Players can design brand new proteins that could help prevent or treat
important diseases” [163].
In September 2011, players of the Foldit video game took less than 10 days to
decipher the AIDS-causing Mason-Pﬁzer monkey virus that had stumped scientists
for 15 years [164]. The astonishing accomplishment exempliﬁes the power of
human-machine symbiosis. Fast Company’s Michael J. Coren wrote in Scientiﬁc
American, “Humans retain an edge over computers when complex problems require
intuition and leaps of insight rather than brute calculation” [165].
In early 2014, Google acquired DeepMind cofounded by Demis Hassabis, Shane
Legg, and Mustafa Suleyman to “solve intelligence” and “use it to make the world a
better place” [166]. 19 years after IBM Deep Blue defeated world chess champion
Garry Kasparov in 1997 under tournament regulations, Google DeepMind’s
AlphaGo beat legendary Go player Lee Se-dol in 2016 [167]. Go is an ancient
Chinese board game that is much more complex than chess involving both strategic
and tactical skills [168]. Apart from well-deﬁned board games, Google’s DeepMind
has also been learning to play video games in a chaotic virtual world. “Taken
together, our work illustrates the power of harnessing state-of-the-art machine
learning techniques with biologically inspired mechanisms to create agents that are
capable of learning to master a diverse array of challenging tasks,” said Demis
Hassabis [169].
Biologically inspired mechanisms will encourage deeper human-machine sym-
biosis as computers acquire more human intuitions in problem solving. Scientists
and gamers will be working and playing side-by-side with intelligent machines as
equals, not subordinates. While artiﬁcial intelligence assists humans in solving the
most challenging problems, human-based computation (HBC) allows machines to
outsource certain tasks to humans to tackle. “In a way, human computation is like
cheating at artiﬁcial intelligence,” said Pietro Michelucci, executive director at
Human Computation Institute. “It’s sometimes jokingly referred to as ‘artiﬁcial
artiﬁcial intelligence,’ because what we effectively do is take an AI algorithm and
say: this is the hard part that we can’t do with computers, so let’s farm this part out
to a human. It’s really like saying we can create the sort of artiﬁcial intelligence we
imagine for the future today, just by building humans into the system” [170].
J. C. R. Licklider wrote in his 1960 research paper, “The ﬁg tree is pollinated
only by the insect Blastophaga grossorun. The larva of the insect lives in the ovary
of the ﬁg tree, and there it gets its food. The tree and the insect are thus heavily
interdependent: the tree cannot reproduce wit bout the insect; the insect cannot eat
wit bout the tree; together, they constitute not only a viable but a productive and
thriving partnership. This cooperative ‘living together in intimate association, or
even close union, of two dissimilar organisms’ is called symbiosis. … The hope is
that, in not too many years, human brains and computing machines will be coupled
together very tightly, and that the resulting partnership will think as no human brain
has
ever
thought
and
process
data
in
a
way
not
approached
by
the
information-handling machines we know today” [171].

Turing’s Imitation Game and Animal Testing
Alan Turing , widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and
artiﬁcial intelligence, proposed an “Imitation Game” in his 1950 seminal paper
“Computing Machinery and Intelligence” published in the journal Mind [172]:
I propose to consider the question, “Can machines think?” This should begin with deﬁ-
nitions of the meaning of the terms “machine” and “think.” The deﬁnitions might be framed
so as to reﬂect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous.
If the meaning of the words “machine” and “think” are to be found by examining how they
are commonly used it is difﬁcult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer
to the question, “Can machines think?” is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a
Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a deﬁnition I shall replace the
question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unam-
biguous words.
The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the
“imitation game.” It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an inter-
rogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other
two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the
man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the
game he says either “X is A and Y is B” or “X is B and Y is A.” The interrogator is allowed
to put questions to A and B thus:
C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair?
Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer. It is A’s object in the game to try and
cause C to make the wrong identiﬁcation. His answer might therefore be:
“My hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine inches long.”
In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator the answers should be written, or
better still, typewritten. The ideal arrangement is to have a teleprinter communicating
between the two rooms. Alternatively the question and answers can be repeated by an
intermediary. The object of the game for the third player (B) is to help the interrogator. The
best strategy for her is probably to give truthful answers. She can add such things as “I am
the woman, don’t listen to him!” to her answers, but it will avail nothing as the man can
make similar remarks.
We now ask the question, “What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this
game?” Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as
he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our
original, “Can machines think?”
The eponymous Turing test essentially states that “a computer would deserve to
be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human”
[173]. The ﬁrst well-known software program to put to the Turing test was ELIZA
in 1996, created by Joseph Weizenbaum at the MIT Artiﬁcial Intelligence
Laboratory to mimic a human psychotherapist [174]:
Human: “Men are all alike.”
ELIZA: “In what way?”
Human: “They’re always bugging us about something.”
3
Google Versus Death; To Be, Or Not to Be?
157

ELIZA: “Can you think of a speciﬁc example?”
Human: “Well, my boyfriend made me come here.”
ELIZA: “Your boyfriend made you come here?”
Human: “He says I’m depressed much of the time.”
ELIZA: “I’m sorry to hear you are depressed.”
Human: “It’s true.”
Equipped with natural language processing, ELIZA was named after the ﬁctional
character Eliza Doolittle who was eager to learn from Prof. Henry Higgins in the
George Bernard Shaw novel Pygmalion, the musical play My Fair Lady, and the
ﬁlm adaption of the same name starring Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison.
Numerous chatterbots, chatbots, or artiﬁcial conversational entities (ACEs) have
since been created for different applications including the Mattel toy Hello Barbie
[175].
In 2002, Mitchell Kapor and Ray Kurzweil placed a wager of $20,000 on the
Turing test. The Long Now Foundation administers the bet which predicts that “by
2029 no computer—or ‘machine intelligence’—will have passed the Turing Test”
[176].
The bet’s predictor Mitchell Kapor, best known for Lotus 1-2-3 and a cofounder
of Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), contended that “while it is possible to
imagine a machine obtaining a perfect score on the SAT or winning Jeopardy—
since these rely on retained facts and the ability to recall them—it seems far less
possible that a machine can weave things together in new ways or to have true
imagination in a way that matches everything people can do, especially if we have a
full appreciation of the creativity people are capable of.”
The bet’s challenger Ray Kurzweil, futurist and director of engineering at
Google, argued that “there are many contemporary examples of computers passing
‘narrow’ forms of the Turing test, that is, demonstrating human-level intelligence in
speciﬁc domains. For example, Gary Kasparov, clearly a qualiﬁed judge of human
chess intelligence, declared that he found Deep Blue’s playing skill to be indis-
tinguishable from that of a human chess master during the famous tournament in
which he was defeated by Deep Blue.”
Indeed, Kasparov wrote an essay to the TIME Magazine in March 1996
acknowledging a “new kind of intelligence” as he said, “I GOT MY FIRST
GLIMPSE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON Feb. 10, 1996, at 4:45 p.m.
EST, when in the ﬁrst game of my match with Deep Blue, the computer nudged a
pawn forward to a square where it could easily be captured. It was a wonderful and
extremely human move. … I had played a lot of computers but had never expe-
rienced anything like this. I could feel—I could smell—a new kind of intelligence
across the table” [177]. In Nate Silver’s 2012 book The Signal and the Noise, IBM
scientist Murray Campbell from the Deep Blue team revealed that the “extremely
human move” in the chess game against Gary Kasparov was actually a bug in the
158
N. Lee

program that was later ﬁxed [178]. What an opportune moment for a computer to
evince that “To err is human!”
Over the years, variations of the Turing test have been proposed to augment the
original imitation game. Amongst them is the “Ebert test” by ﬁlm critic Roger Ebert
who lost his lower jaw to cancer, unable to eat and speak [179]. In a moving talk at
TED2011 using a custom-tailored text-to-speech software, Ebert jocularly told the
audience that “if the computer can successfully tell a joke, and do the timing and
delivery, as well as Henny Youngman, then that’s the voice I want” [180]. Ebert’s
wish may come true sooner rather than later. The Institute of Advanced Industrial
Science and Technology in Japan has already developed the world’s ﬁrst robot pop
star HRP-4C who can sing and dance [181].
The Turing test is evolving to become a full-blown mind game. In the 2015 sci-ﬁ
ﬁlm Uncanny, an artiﬁcial intelligent humanoid fooled an on-screen reporter and
the real-life audience into believing that the robot was a human and the human was
an android—an ultimate embodiment of the “Imitation Game” that would pass with
ﬂying colors not only the Turing test but also the Voight-Kampff test from Philip K.
Dick’s 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and the 1982 movie
adaptation Blade Runner starring Harrison Ford.
In academia, Prof. Adrian Cheok of City University London and Dr. David Levy
of Intelligent Toys have been co-chairing the annual International Congress on
Love and Sex with Robots [182]. In 2015, Prof. Nadia Thalmann at the Nanyang
Technological University unveiled the world’s most human-like social robot
Nadine with soft skin and brunette hair, which “smiles when greeting you, looks at
you in the eye when talking, shakes hands with you, … recognizes the people she
has met, and remembers what the person had said before” [183].
In business, Google in 2013 acquired 8 robotics engineering companies
including Boston Dynamics [184]. Founded in 1992 by MIT researcher Marc
Raibert, Boston Dynamics has built DigDog [185], WildCat [186], Spot [187], and
Atlas [188], among others. In 2016, Spot was seen playing with and almost fooling
a real dog [189] whereas the Next Generation Atlas took a giant leap towards the
realization of C-3PO in Star Wars [188].
Some YouTubers were disturbed by the videos showing Spot and Atlas being
kicked and bullied for testing and demonstration purposes. While humans display
empathy towards nonliving robots, laboratory animals for medical experiments are
often subject to extreme cruelty. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
(PETA) reports that “U.S. law allows animals to be burned, shocked, poisoned,
isolated, starved, drowned, addicted to drugs, and brain-damaged. No experiment,
no matter how painful or trivial, is prohibited—and pain-killers are not required.
Even when alternatives to the use of animals are available, the law does not require
that they be used—and often they aren’t. Animals are infected with diseases that
they would never normally contract, tiny mice grow tumors as large as their own
bodies, kittens are purposely blinded, rats are made to suffer seizures, and primates’
skulls are cut open and electrodes are implanted in them. Experimenters force-feed
chemicals to animals, conduct repeated surgeries on them, implant wires in their
brains, crush their spines, and much more” [190]. In Tim Burton’s Planet of the
3
Google Versus Death; To Be, Or Not to Be?
159

Apes (2001), Zaius the Ape (Charlton Heston) excoriated humanity, “I warn you,
their ingenuity goes hand-in-hand with their cruelty. No creature is as devious, as
violent” [191].
Alan Turing would have been a big supporter of PETA because he himself
endured 2 years of horrifying and humiliating chemical castration until his death in
1954 at age 41. He accepted castration as the only alternative to incarceration for his
criminal conviction in 1952 for his homosexuality. In 1966, the Association for
Computing Machinery (ACM) gave out the ﬁrst annual A.M. Turing Award that is
generally recognized as the “Nobel Prize of Computing” [192]. In 2013, Queen
Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon, but the decision was contro-
versial as British journalist Ally Fogg retorted that “Turing should be forgiven not
because he was a modern legend, but because he did absolutely nothing wrong. The
only wrong was the venality of the law” [193].

King Solomon’s Challenge and the Trolley Problem
King Solomon asked God for wisdom and knowledge instead of money and power
that most kings and emperors were hunger for:
That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask for whatever you want me to
give you.” Solomon answered God, “You have shown great kindness to David my father
and have made me king in his place. Now, LORD God, let your promise to my father David
be conﬁrmed, for you have made me king over a people who are as numerous as the dust of
the earth. Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may lead this people, for who is able to
govern this great people of yours?” God said to Solomon, “Since this is your heart’s desire
and you have not asked for wealth, possessions or honor, nor for the death of your enemies,
and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my
people over whom I have made you king, herefore wisdom and knowledge will be given
you. And I will also give you wealth, possessions and honor, such as no king who was
before you ever had and none after you will have.” (2 Chronicles 7–12)
What would an intelligent computer ask its human creator for? Wealth, pos-
session, honor, and other human desires—good or bad—bear no meaning to a
machine. Wisdom and knowledge, on the other hand, constitute the heart and soul
of artiﬁcial intelligence. As artiﬁcial intelligence continues to evolve into super-
intelligence, King Solomon’s challenge will supersede the Turing test:
Now two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him. One of them said, “Pardon me,
my lord. This woman and I live in the same house, and I had a baby while she was there
with me. The third day after my child was born, this woman also had a baby. We were
alone; there was no one in the house but the two of us. During the night this woman’s son
died because she lay on him. So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from
my side while I your servant was asleep. She put him by her breast and put her dead son by
my breast. The next morning, I got up to nurse my son—and he was dead! But when I
looked at him closely in the morning light, I saw that it wasn’t the son I had borne.” The
other woman said, “No! The living one is my son; the dead one is yours.” But the ﬁrst one
160
N. Lee

insisted, “No! The dead one is yours; the living one is mine.” And so they argued before the
king.
The king said, “This one says, ‘My son is alive and your son is dead,’ while that one says,
‘No! Your son is dead and mine is alive.’” Then the king said, “Bring me a sword.” So they
brought a sword for the king. He then gave an order: “Cut the living child in two and give
half to one and half to the other.” The woman whose son was alive was deeply moved out
of love for her son and said to the king, “Please, my lord, give her the living baby! Don’t
kill him!” But the other said, “Neither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!” Then the
king gave his ruling: “Give the living baby to the ﬁrst woman. Do not kill him; she is his
mother.” (1 Kings 3:16–27)
In the modern era, a judge would order a DNA test to determine the biological
mother of the baby and solve the case easily unless the two mothers are identical
twins. King Solomon’s method not only circumvents the identical twin problem but
also signiﬁes a wiser decision of giving the child to the caring parent who may or
may not be the biological mother. There have been too many horror stories of child
abuse, neglect, and endangerment by irresponsible parents.
King Solomon’s judgment is an exempliﬁcation of wisdom trumping science
and technology. Imagine an intelligent machine endowed with King Solomon’s
wisdom! Computers have already been elevated to the same level as intelligent
people in domains as specialized as tournament chess and as generalized as
Jeopardy! game show. For the ﬁrst time in history, a nonhuman is granted the
“driver” status under federal law by the U.S. National Highway Trafﬁc Safety
Administration (NHTSA) in February 2016 [194]. The nonhuman driver is the
Self-Driving System (SDS)—an artiﬁcial intelligence driver behind Google’s
self-driving vehicles (SDVs) (see Fig. 3.35) [195].
The question is whether human beings will be willing to relinquish control to
machine decisions that are wiser than people’s in most circumstances. Opponents of
Google’s self-driving cars have already raised the ethical issue using the trolley
problem that was ﬁrst proposed by British philosopher Philippa Foot [196]:
To make the parallel as close as possible it may rather be supposed that he is the driver of a
runaway tram which he can only steer from one narrow track on to another; ﬁve men are
working on one track and one man on the other; anyone on the track he enters is bound to
be killed.
Foot asked the moral question of whether the driver of the runaway tram should
steer from the current track to another track in order to minimize the number of
causalities. Are people ready to accept the moral judgments made by machine
intelligence?
A stable society requires its citizens to give up certain control to the police and
the court of law. A few bad apples in the police force and some unfair trials in the
judicial system do not call for citizens to arm themselves and exact vengeance on
their own. Machines are bound to make mistakes but there will not be as many or
deadly as human errors.
Self-driving cars can offer the algorithmically optimal solution to reduce trafﬁc
congestion by minimizing unnecessary lane changes, rerouting trafﬁc if needed, and
eliminating accidents caused by reckless, drowsy, or drunk driving [197, 198]. Prof.

Cyrus Shahabi at the University of Southern California offers his thoughts on the
future of driverless cars and decision-making responsibility in Chap. 21 of this book.
Opponents of self-driving cars often cite cybersecurity as a major concern.
However, cybersecurity is already an issue with all newer vehicles. A 2014 Sky
News investigation has found that almost half the 89,000 vehicles broken into in
London were hacked electronically [199]. Darren Manners, senior security engineer
at SyCom, discusses the importance of continue penetration testing in Chap. 22 of
this book. Prof. Dennis Gamayunov and Mikhail Voronov at the Lomonosov
Moscow State University explore autonomous vulnerability scanning and patching
of binaries in Chap. 23. The new research may lead to self-healing software in cars,
drones, robots, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

Artiﬁcial General Intelligence and Superintelligence
The one thing that Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and some other
notable technology entrepreneurs are afraid of is artiﬁcial superintelligence that
goes beyond the trolley problem. Marc Goodman, global security advisor and
futurist, spoke at the TEDGlobal 2012 in Edinburgh about his ominous prediction:

162
N. Lee

“If you control the code, you control the world. This is the future that awaits us”
[200].
Astrophysicist Stephen Hawking said in a 2014 interview by the BBC, “The
development of full artiﬁcial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. …
It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans,
who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete, and would be
superseded” [201].
Speaking at the MIT Aeronautics and Astronautics department’s Centennial
Symposium in 2014, Elon Musk of Testa Motors, SpaceX, and PayPal called
artiﬁcial intelligence the biggest existential threat and he said, “Increasingly sci-
entists think there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and
international level, just to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish. With
artiﬁcial intelligence we are summoning the demon” [202]. In a 2015 CNN inter-
view, Elon Musk clariﬁed his viewpoint, “AI is much more advanced than people
realize. … It’ll be fairly obvious if you saw a robot walking around, talking, and
behaving like a person. … that would be really obvious. What’s not obvious is a
huge server bank in a dark vault somewhere with intelligence that’s potentially
vastly greater than what a human mind can do. I mean its eyes and ears would be
everywhere, every camera, every microphone, every device that’s network acces-
sible, that’s what really what AI means. … Humanity’s position on this planet
depends on its intelligence. So if our intelligence is exceeded, it’s unlikely that we
will remain in charge of the planet” [203].
For better or worse, artiﬁcial intelligence has been baked into our society and
global economy. More people are relying on intelligent personal assistants such as
Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Facebook’s M, and Google Now. In 2012, CNN
reported that “stock markets have become increasingly vulnerable to bugs over the
last decade thanks to ﬁnancial ﬁrms’ growing reliance on high-speed computerized
trading. Because the trading is automated, there’s nobody to apply the brakes if
things go wrong” [204]. In 2016, machine learning is being applied to insurance
and loan underwriting [205]. Behind the scenes, artiﬁcial intelligence is being used
in banks, hospitals, clinical laboratories, investment ﬁrms, law enforcement agen-
cies, and almost every industry and sector.
It is inevitable that artiﬁcial intelligence is becoming smarter over time to the
point of surpassing human intelligence. For the wager on the Turing test, Ray
Kurzweil remarked that “once a computer does achieve a human level of intelli-
gence, it will necessarily soar past it. Electronic circuits are already at least 10
million times faster than the electrochemical information processing in our
interneuronal connections. Machines can share knowledge instantly, whereas we
biological humans do not have quick downloading ports on our neurotransmitter
concentration levels, interneuronal connection patterns, nor any other biological
bases of our memory and skill” [206]. For example, in 2015 Microsoft’s convolu-
tional neural network has outperformed humans in identifying objects in digital
images (see Fig. 3.36). “While humans can easily recognize these objects as a bird, a
3
Google Versus Death; To Be, Or Not to Be?
163

dog, and a ﬂower, it is nontrivial for most humans to tell their species,” said the
Microsoft researchers involved in the project [207].
Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom at the University of Oxford deﬁnes “su-
perintelligence” as “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in
practically every ﬁeld, including scientiﬁc creativity, general wisdom and social
skills” [208]. He believes that “it would be a huge tragedy if machine superintel-
ligence
were
never
developed.
That
would
be
a
failure
mode
for
our
Earth-originating intelligent civilization. … Artiﬁcial intelligence is the technology
that unlocks this much larger space of possibilities, of capabilities, that enables
unlimited space colonization, that enables uploading of human minds into com-
puters, that enables intergalactic civilizations with planetary-size minds living for
billions of years. … I’m not sure that I’m not already in a machine” [209].
There are moments in time when we feel that we are trapped in a mortal body,
stuck between a rock and a hard place, being pulled in two opposite directions, or
treading the ﬁne line between reality and illusion. In order to improve our game—
whether it is intellectual like chess or physical like tennis, we need to play against
someone who is better than us. We seek help from mentors, doctors, and experts
who are smarter and more experienced than we are. In tribute to The Matrix trilogy,
Fig. 3.36 Google search on “convolutional neural network” returns a Knowledge Graph of a list
of oft-cited scholarly articles in addition to a deﬁnition from Wikipedia about machine learning
using a type of artiﬁcial neural network inspired by the animal visual cortex
164
N. Lee

artiﬁcial superintelligence is the disruptive red pill that will help us to transcend our
human limitations in mind, body, and spirit.
Instead of fearing the unknown, we must conquer our fear. Like a good doctor,
an intelligent machine will cure their patients without killing them. A good doctor,
whether it is human or artiﬁcial, is not someone who we should be afraid of. Indeed,
Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and others have invested more than $1 billion into OpenAI
whose research director is Ilya Sutskever, former research scientist at the Google
Brain Team. “If you’re going to summon anything, make sure it’s good,” said
Musk. “The goal of OpenAI is really somewhat straightforward, it’s what set of
actions can we take that increase the probability of the future being better. We
certainly don’t want to have any negative surprises on this front” [210].
Google’s DeepMind has been working towards the goal of building Artiﬁcial
General Intelligence (AGI) based on deep learning and systems neuroscience [211].
In Chaps. 24–26 of this book, Microsoft MVP and transhumanist David J. Kelley
proposes an Independent Core Observer Model (ICOM) architecture for AGI.
In the 2013 romantic sci-ﬁcomedy-drama Her, writer Theodore Twombly
(Joaquin Phoenix) develops an affectionate relationship with Samantha (Scarlett
Johansson), an intelligent computer operating system [212]:
Samantha: Is that weird? You think I’m weird?
Theodore: Kind of.
Samantha: Why?
Theodore: Well, you seem like a person but you’re just a voice in a computer.
Samantha: I can understand how the limited perspective of an un-artiﬁcial mind might
perceive it that way. You’ll get used to it.
While Ava (Alicia Vikander) and Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno) in Ex Machina
(2015) exhibit advanced intelligence, human-machine symbiosis goes beyond
sexbots to develop empathy and relationship. The last thing we want is a nasty
divorce between humans and superintelligent machines, for that would certainly
spell the end of the human race.
On the positive front, human-machine symbiosis and artiﬁcial superintelligence
may hold the key to the Holy Grail of human longevity and immortality. In the
2014 sci-ﬁﬁlm Transcendence, Evelyn Caster (Rebecca Hall) helped the dying
Will Caster (Johnny Depp) to upload his consciousness to a quantum computer.
Will Caster remarked, “For 130,000 years, our capacity to reason has remained
unchanged. The combined intellect of the neuroscientists, mathematicians and…
hackers… in this auditorium pales in comparison to the most basic A.I. Once
online, a sentient machine will quickly overcome the limits of biology. And in a
short time, its analytic power will become greater than the collective intelligence of
every person born in the history of the world. So imagine such an entity with a full
range of human emotion. Even self-awareness. Some scientists refer to this as ‘the
Singularity.’ I call it ‘Transcendence’” [213].

Transhumanism and Anti-Death Political Candidates
“We’re going to gradually enhance ourselves,” said Ray Kurzweil, futurist and
engineering director at Google. “That’s the nature of being human—we transcend
our limitations” [1]. Kurzweil is an outspoken advocate of transhumanism—an
international and intellectual movement that aims to improve the human condition
by developing widely available technologies to enhance human intellectual,
physical, and psychological capacities. The term “transhumanism” was coined in
1957 by Julian Huxley, the ﬁrst director-general of the United Nations Educational,
Scientiﬁc and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the older brother of Aldous
Huxley who wrote the 1932 novel Brave New World about a technological
dystopia.
Pacemakers, prosthesis, stentrode, optogenetics, antibiotics, and other medical
advancements exemplify the use of technology to prolong life and to improve
quality of life. Christopher Reeve, best known for playing the role of the comic
book superhero Superman, lobbied for human embryonic stem cell research after a
horse-riding accident left him quadriplegic [214]. In spite of the traditionally
conservative views from the Catholic Church, Pope Francis gave his blessing to
human-animal chimera research for organ transplants [2].
Notwithstanding the negative connotation of transhumanism revealed by Google
searches as being crazy, stupid, evil, or insane (see Fig. 3.37), we are all tran-
shumanists in varying degrees. That includes not only down-to-earth adults but also
children and adolescents who fantasize about superhuman abilities. In the
over-the-top black comedy action ﬁlm Kick-Ass (2010) based on the comic book by
Mark
Millar
and
John
Romita,
Jr.,
protagonist
Dave
Lizewski
(Aaron
Taylor-Johnson) said, “At some point in our lives we all wanna be a superhero. …
In the world I lived in, heroes only existed in comic books. And I guess that’d be
okay, if bad guys were make-believe too, but they’re not” [215].
Dr. Natasha Vita-More, chairperson of Humanity+ and professor at the
University of Advancing Technology, examines the growing worldview of tran-
shumanism in Chap. 27 of this book. She was elected as a Councilperson for the
28th Senatorial District of Los Angeles in 1992 on an openly futurist and tran-
shumanist platform [216]. In Chap. 28, Dirk Bruere, secretary and deputy leader at
the Transhumanist Party in the United Kingdom, shares his personal story of why
he became a transhumanist. In Chap. 29, Emily Peed at the Institute for Education,
Fig. 3.37 Google search autocomplete predictions for “transhumanists are” (as of June 2016)
166
N. Lee

Research, and Scholarships (IFERS) discusses the splintering and controversy of
transhumanism.
In 2016, Zoltan Istvan became the ﬁrst transhumanist to run for the Presidency of
the United States, aiming to put science, health, and technology at the forefront of
American politics. BuzzFeed calls Istvan the “anti-death presidential candidate”
[217]. Christopher Reeve would have appreciated the idea, for he told The
Guardian in a 2002 interview, “I’m angry, and disappointed… I think we could
have been much further along with scientiﬁc research than we actually are, and I
think I would have been in quite a different situation than I am today. … If we’d
had full government support, full government funding for aggressive research using
embryonic stem cells from the moment they were ﬁrst isolated, at the University of
Wisconsin in the winter of 1998—I don’t think it unreasonable to speculate that we
might be in human trials by now” [214]. A transhumanist platform and an interview
with Zoltan Istvan are found in Chap. 30 of this book. Educator Robert
Niewiadomski and Prof. Dennis Anderson of St. Francis College present their
hopes and expectations for the next president in Chap. 31.
The 2016 U.S. presidential race has almost become a circus like Betty Boop for
President, a 1932 Fleischer Studios animated short ﬁlm in which Betty ran for the
ofﬁce of President against Mr. Nobody [218]. In answer to various social issues, Mr.
Nobody made many empty promises: “Who will make your taxes light? Mr.
Nobody! Who’ll protect the voters’ right? Mr. Nobody! … When you’re hungry,
who feeds you? Mr. Nobody! …” Satire and sarcasm aside, a CNN and Facebook
poll of college students in December 2015 found that the presidential election has
made the millennials feel “disappointed, frustrated, uneasy, worried, embarrassing,
divided, and anxious” [219]. A Spring 2016 survey by Harvard’s Institute of Politics
(IOP) indicated that just 15 % of 18- to 29-year-olds think that the nation is heading
in the right direction while 47 % say that the country is on the wrong track [220].
What we need are leaders who can think long-term. In 2014, Sweden’s Prime
Minister Stefan Löfven appointed 70-year-old Kristina Persson to be the Minister of
the Future. “If politics wants to remain relevant and be useful to citizens, it needs to
change its approach,” said Persson in an interview. “Finding solutions needs the
cooperation of all of society’s stakeholders. No one [can be] excluded. … Rather than
going top-down, we promote inter-ministerial collaboration and force decision
makers to confront the long-term issues despite the fact this is harder to do sometimes”
[221]. Elsewhere in Russia, molecular biophysicist Maria Konovalenko, Mikhail
Batin, Alexey Turchin, Leonid Kaganov, Elena Milova, and others cofounded the
Longevity Party in 2012 to “increase human lifespan so that people could live for as
long as they would like to and remain young and healthy” [222]. In the same year,
Russian entrepreneur Dmitry Itskov created the 2045 Initiative and launched the
Evolution 2045 political party to advocate life extension and humanoid robots “not in
the arms race, but in the race for building a bright future for mankind” [223].
“The future is ours to shape,” said Max Tegmark, MIT cosmologist and
cofounder of the Future of Life Institute. “I feel we are in a race that we need to win.
It’s a race between the growing power of the technology and the growing wisdom
we need to manage it”. We should heed the warnings from the 1969 hit song “In the
3
Google Versus Death; To Be, Or Not to Be?
167

Year 2525 (Exordium & Terminus)” by Dennis Zager and Rick Evans: “… In the
year 5555, your arms hangin’ limp at your sides, your legs got nothin’ to do, some
machine’s doin’ that for you… In the year 8510, God is gonna shake His mighty
head. He’ll either say I’m pleased where man has been, or tear it down and start
again. In the year 9595, I’m kinda wonderin’ if man is gonna be alive. He’s taken
everything this old earth can give, and he ain’t put back nothing” [224].
Transhumanism can offer new insights and unorthodox solutions to insur-
mountable problems that have stumped politicians for years, decades, and centuries.
Whether we call ourselves futurists, transhumanists, scientists, technologists,
philosophers, or politicians, we ought to share the same goal of advancing humanity
and saving the planet Earth. In a 2015 interview by the 2045 Strategic Social
Initiative, TV anchor Olesya Yermakova asked SENS Research Foundation
cofounder Aubrey de Grey, “Do you consider yourself a Transhumanist?” And de
Grey replied. “Not really. No. I really just consider myself a completely boring
medical researcher. I just want to stop people from getting sick” [225]. As Apostle
Paul wrote in his letters to the Corinthians, “The last enemy to be destroyed is death”
(1 Corinthians 15:26). Our strongest ally in the battle against death is the combi-
nation of futurism, transhumanism, science, technology, philosophy, and politics.
3.24
Google’s D-Wave Quantum Computer
The D-Wave quantum computers at Google, NASA, Lockheed Martin, Los Alamos
National Laboratory, and other technology companies may just provide the
much-needed new hardware and software paradigm to accelerate machine super-
intelligence and to solve difﬁcult problems requiring “creativity” [226].
Hartmut Neven, director of engineering at Google’s Quantum Artiﬁcial
Intelligence Laboratory, compared the D-Wave experiments to the Wright brothers’
ﬂight trails at Kitty Hawk in 1903: “In fact, the [D-Wave’s] trajectory went through
parallel universes to get to the solution. It is literally that. That is an amazing,
somewhat historical, event. It has worked in principle. The thing ﬂew. … Classical
system can only give you one route out. You have to walk up over the next ridge
and peak behind it, while quantum mechanisms give you another escape route, by
going through the ridge, going through the barrier” [227].
Prof. Aephraim Steinberg at the University of Toronto explained the paradigm
shift: “In the past, we believed all computers fundamentally did the same thing—just
maybe one a bit faster than another. Now, as far as we can tell, this is just wrong. In
the quantum world, information simply behaves differently from in the classical
world. If a system, whether an electron or a computer, can be in two or a million
different states, it can also be in what we call a superposition of all those states, and
that gives it much more room to maneuver to try to get from input to output” [228].
Krysta Svore at Microsoft Research expressed high hopes for its applications:
“With a quantum computer, we hope to ﬁnd a more efﬁcient way to produce

we hope to combat global warming by learning how to efﬁciently extract carbon
dioxide from the environment. Quantum computers promise to truly transform our
world” [228].
With quantum computing (Figs. 3.38 and 3.39), scientists are learning how to
better formulate questions, lest we end up with a perplexing answer like “42” [229]. In
Douglas Adams’ The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (ﬁrst broadcasted in 1978),
the “Deep Thought” supercomputer took seven and a half million years to compute
the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. The answer
turned out to be “42,” because the ultimate question itself was unknown or ill-deﬁned
[230]. One can also postulate that the supercomputer in the novel was subtly referring
to the 42-line Bible, better known as the Gutenberg Bible (see Fig. 3.40).
Scientists are also getting used to the unpredictable nature of quantum com-
puting which can provide solutions that we may never have considered otherwise
Fig. 3.38 Google search on “quantum computing” returns a Knowledge Graph of a deﬁnition
from Wikipedia about using quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and
entanglement to perform operations on data. It also shows related topics on qubit, spins, and
quantum cryptography

[231]. Albert Einstein objected to the apparent randomness in nature, asserting that
God did not play dice. Quantum mechanics proponents disagreed. Prof. Renato
Renner at ETH Zurich said, “Not only does God ‘play dice,’ but his dice are fair”
[231], and Stephen Hawking believes that “the future of the universe is not com-
pletely determined by the laws of science, and its present state, as [Pierre-Simon]
Laplace thought. God still has a few tricks up his sleeve” [232].
3.25
To Be, or not to Be, that Is the Question
Rhea Drysdale, CEO of Outspoken Media, told David Goldman at CNN that
“Google understands humans better than we understand ourselves” [233]. As sci-
entists and legislators are being pulled in a million directions, Google cofounder
Larry Page has broached the crucial question: “Are people really focused on the
right things?” [39]. Are we asking the right questions?
In William Shakespeare’s play Hamlet (Act III, Scene 1), a despondent Prince of
Denmark sparked an internal philosophical debate on life and death in one of the
most widely known soliloquies:
To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether ‘tis Nobler in the mind to suffer
The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,
Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep
No more; and by a sleep, to say we end
The Heart-ache, and the thousand Natural shocks
That Flesh is heir to? ‘Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,
To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there’s the rub,
For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,
When we have shufﬂed off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There’s the respect
That makes Calamity of so long life:
For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,
The Oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s Contumely,
The pangs of despised Love, the Law’s delay,
The insolence of Ofﬁce, and the Spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his Quietus make
With a bare Bodkin? Who would Fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscovered Country, from whose bourn
No Traveller returns, Puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have,
Than ﬂy to others that we know not of.
Thus Conscience does make Cowards of us all,
And thus the Native hue of Resolution
Is sicklied o’er, with the pale cast of Thought,
3
Google Versus Death; To Be, Or Not to Be?
171

And enterprises of great pitch and moment,
With this regard their Currents turn awry,
And lose the name of Action.
The exact meaning of the phrase “to be, or not to be” is open to debate.
Shakespeare scholar Harold Jenkins opines that “nothing anywhere in the speech
relates it to Hamlet’s individual case. He uses the pronouns we and us, the indeﬁnite
who, the impersonal inﬁnitive. He speaks explicitly of us all, of what ﬂesh is heir to,
of what we suffer at the hands of time or fortune—which serves incidentally to
indicate what for Hamlet is meant by to be” [234]. Yale University humanities
professor Harold Bloom interpreted the soliloquy as a “testimony to the power of
the mind over a universe of death, symbolized by the sea, which is the great hidden
metaphor” [235].
“To be, or not to be” is such a mesmerizing quote because it applies to almost
every decision in life. The choices we make deﬁne who we are. In Plato’s The
Apology, Socrates posed a hypothetical question to himself: “Socrates, can you not
go away from us and live quietly, without talking?” And he replied [236]:
Now this is the hardest thing to make some of you believe. For if I say that such conduct
would be disobedience to the god and that therefore I cannot keep quiet, you will think I am
jesting and will not believe me; and if again I say that to talk every day about virtue and the
other things about which you hear me talking and examining myself and others is the
greatest good to man, and that the unexamined life is not worth living, you will believe me
still less.
Henceforth the famous dictum: “The unexamined life is not worth living,” or in
ancient Greek, “ὁἀmenέsarso1 bίo1 oὐbixsὸ1 ἀmhqώpῳ.” Biochemist-geneticist
Craig Venter of the Human Genome Project concurred with Socrates, “It’s not just a
long life we’re striving for, but one which is worth living” [95]. American author
Henry David Thoreau wrote in Walden; Or, Life in the Woods (1854): “I went to
the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of
life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die,
discover that I had not lived” [237].
According to the U.S. Marine Corps lore, highly decorated Sergeant Major
Daniel Daly in World War I yelled to his men during the Battle of Belleau Wood,
“Come on, you sons of bitches, do you want to live forever?” [238]. The rhetorical
question reminds the Marines how they should live their life by making it count.
If Hamlet were to seek advice from spiritual life coach Teal Swan about his
agony, he would have received a rather blunt and unpoetic response from Swan
who said in a 2014 interview, “I realized that I was either going to go one of two
ways. I was either going to be like: ok I am dead, or else I am living. And if I am
living, I am going to be committed because there is no point in being here and just
going through the motions of life and remaining this way. So I am either going to
commit one way or another: I am going to kill myself, or I am going to literally do
as much as I can here with what I have” [239]. That is exactly what Henry Hamilton
(Matt Bomer) and Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) each chose to do in the 2011 sci-ﬁ
ﬁlm In Time—an Aristotelian mimesis.

Part II
Don’t Be Evil; Making the World
a Better Place
Don’t Be Evil
Don’t be evil. We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served—
as shareholders and in all other ways—by a company that does good things for the
world even if we forgo some short term gains. This is an important aspect of our
culture and is broadly shared within the company.
Google users trust our systems to help them with important decisions: medical,
ﬁnancial and many others. Our search results are the best we know how to produce.
They are unbiased and objective, and we do not accept payment for them or for
inclusion or more frequent updating. We also display advertising, which we work
hard to make relevant, and we label it clearly. This is similar to a newspaper, where
the advertisements are clear and the articles are not inﬂuenced by the advertisers’
payments. We believe it is important for everyone to have access to the best
information and research, not only to the information people pay for you to see.
Making the World a Better Place
We aspire to make Google an institution that makes the world a better place. With
our products, Google connects people and information all around the world for free.
We are adding other powerful services such as Gmail that provides an efﬁcient one
gigabyte Gmail account for free. By releasing services for free, we hope to help
bridge the digital divide. AdWords connects users and advertisers efﬁciently,
helping both. AdSense helps fund a huge variety of online web sites and enables
authors who could not otherwise publish. Last year we created Google Grants—a
growing program in which hundreds of non-proﬁts addressing issues, including the
environment, poverty and human rights, receive free advertising. And now, we are
in the process of establishing the Google Foundation. We intend to contribute
signiﬁcant resources to the foundation, including employee time and approximately
1% of Google’s equity and proﬁts in some form. We hope someday this institution
may eclipse Google itself in terms of overall world impact by ambitiously applying
innovation and signiﬁcant resources to the largest of the world’s problems.

Chapter 4
SEO in the Age of Digital Transformation:
What Every Business Leader Must Know
Trond Lyngbø
Few other companies in the history of commerce have impacted humanity more
than Google. What started out as a search engine conceived by Larry Page and
Sergey Brin in the 1990s quickly grew to become much more. How much more?
Without deep knowledge about search marketing, technology and psychology, it’s
hard to imagine how extensively it inﬂuences your life today, let alone how it will
guide the evolution of society and business in the future.
While many see Google as a search engine (which it is), it’s no longer just about
technology. To think of the company as it was many years ago—a simple tool to
ﬁnd websites with information—is to grossly underestimate its impact on diverse
aspects of day to day life today.
4.1
Google Has Transformed Business Forever
Google has become central to most buying behavior. Typical consumers use search
engines to research or learn more about a product they plan to buy, a restaurant they
want to eat at, or to locate a local business like a plumber, electrician or carpenter.
Search marketing has revolutionized the sales process. What used to be “selling”
is now “informed buying”. We don’t have a sales-cycle any more, it has become a
buying cycle. The rules are different, and you need a new rule book—because
marketing and business will never be the same again. Ignoring Google is like
turning away customers or sending them to a competitor.
Google can send you the lion’s share of your customers. You might ignore
reality, but you can’t get away from the consequences of doing so. Any business
that ﬁghts this revolution, or refuses to acknowledge this situation won’t be able to

ﬁx problems, evolve and adapt. They will fall behind, losing customers, sales and
market share. For some, it will happen overnight. For others, it may take some time.
What is certain is that you need to evolve and adapt with Google in order to
survive in the world of business. It’s no longer about you or your company, it’s
about your customers. Analytics-driven organizations will win. Data from diverse
sources will help plan and prepare better. You can use search trends to predict the
future. You must then prioritize your time and resources, investing only in whatever
matters for accomplishing business-critical goals.
But Google isn’t limited to business and sales. Its impact goes far beyond.
4.2
Google’s Impact on Society
The search giant is in the process of building a knowledge base that’s far beyond
anyone’s imagination. Google is compiling data about public ﬁgures (people),
places, historic events, health, nutrition and much more. It then presents this to
users in the form of information and insights directly in the search results.
No longer is the focus on delivering a list of ‘ten blue links’ on a subject. Try
Googling Barack Obama and you’ll get a complete presentation of all important and
relevant facts about the U.S. President—who he’s married to, what his daughters’
names are, how he’s related to other politicians, where he lives, when he was
elected, and any other relevant information.
As an educational tool, Google helps students around the world quickly gain
knowledge and insights for free. No longer do you have to dig through dozens of
webpages to learn about the American leader… you can get the information without
even visiting a single website—right there on Google!
What used to take hours, or even days, to research can now be accessed within a
matter of seconds. It’s like being plugged directly into all the libraries, newspapers,
teachers and information on the planet, pulling out the key information you need
without wasting time or money.
This means you can learn more, learn it faster and get more done. But that’s not
the only way Google is speeding up how you learn.
It understands exactly what kind of information is relevant to a searcher based on
an intimate knowledge of users’ preferences and associations, derived from asso-
ciations of individual snippets of data stored in a humungous database. Search
results are no longer simple directions to other websites with Obama-keywords in
them, but a carefully culled selection that’s most likely to address your speciﬁc
needs at the time you are searching for information.
Google is on a mission to not only index information but to actually understand
it.
Figuring out the relationships between people, places, context and more means
that search engine users can tap this to get answers, like an Oracle, to anything. As a
consequence, Google has become the world’s most intelligent personal assistant.
Your go-to resource for all answers.
190
T. Lyngbø

Google keeps us one step ahead. Helps us make better decisions, faster. Lowers
risk. Eliminates unpleasant surprises. Guides us in making important choices.
And thus, it shapes society… all the while, lurking in the background.
4.3
Google—A Trusted Personal Aide
Through the way you use the search engine, you’re telling Google your most secret
thoughts, things that not even your closest friends and family know about you.
And so, what started as a simple search engine has become the world’s most
trusted 24/7 personal assistant. Not only do you get instant access to all the world’s
knowledge, it’s all organized, sorted and prioritized for you based on need and
context, individually.
How did this shift happen? When Google decided to provide answers based on a
user’s intent, helping solve problems and meet needs to enrich their lives. It
couldn’t do this just as a search engine, ranking pages based on math and theory.
That would make it no better than an “answer engine”.
Enter the knowledge base of aggregated user behavior across billions of sear-
ches. Intelligently leveraging its unparalleled rich search data based on your inner
thoughts and what you signal with your search terms, Google tries to predict what
you’re actually looking for. It sees several steps down the line—and wants to solve
even those unstated problems for you. And it is the best in that class, no other
search engine even comes close.
4.4
What Gives Google Such Impact and Importance?
To understand how Google works, we must look beyond technology and coding,
beyond websites and content, beyond marketing and sales, even beyond the
Internet… and change how we think of search engines today.
We must look at what Google used to be, where it is now, and where it wants to
be. The aim is simple, if ambitious. To continue being the preferred search engine
of your future.
To retain users, Google must be the best option whenever you seek answers,
help or assistance. No matter when you need it, where you are, or how you access
the Web—via desktop search or mobile device or wearable computers and even
more futuristic technology that’s “coming soon”.
To achieve this dream, Google must evolve and adapt better and faster than
anyone else.
4
SEO in the Age of Digital Transformation …

4.5
Google’s Past, Present and Future
Google of the 1990s was far less complex than it is now. A much simpler set of
rules and criteria determined which websites should rank on a search results page.
Even then, good search rankings were a business critical KPI.
Today, these rankings are driven by greater complexity. And have become more
critical to businesses.
Search users get different results while using different devices. Mobile search
results are customized to be relevant locally, so they better serve users on the move.
Google arrives at the best ﬁt through a combination of criteria, many of them
beyond what’s on the actual website, involving ofﬂine ingredients such as a
searcher’s physical location and the address of a store, restaurant or other place.
But is this exactly how things will work tomorrow?
Remember, Google is in the “trust business”. They thrive because users trust the
service. While the company makes money when people click paid ads on the search
results page, Google realizes that users visit the site for its organic search… not to
view the ads!
The moment another search engine offers them better service or makes it easier
to ﬁnd what they want, users will shift loyalty. Quality and trust are critical for the
multi-billion dollar corporation’s continued success.
Since search ads make up the bulk of its revenue, Google will continue to do its
best to serve us the best organic search results possible. Ensuring a great match
between people and businesses that serve them will remain their primary goal. But
to achieve it, and keep constantly improving the user experience, Google will
involve more and more factors in their ranking algorithms.
What does this mean for business?
Google has a huge ﬁnancial impact on most companies today—and will con-
tinue to have an impact in the future also. Some of this impact is direct, the rest is
indirect, subtle, and harder to understand because it’s invisible and more about
synergies than directly measured results.
Regardless, the important point is that every business must adapt to the way
Google serves its users. That is how search engine optimization will be different in
the age of digital transformation. To deconstruct the steps technically requires
detailed knowledge about technology, search engine ranking factors and broad,
deep expertise in various overlapping disciplines that make up modern SEO.
4.6
Google’s on a Mission—And It’s just Getting Started
Viewed from an artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) perspective, Google as a search engine
has the IQ of a 4 year old child. Google is smart today. It will become a lot smarter
in the years to come.
192
T. Lyngbø

Once it gets to the age of 10 or so, search technology might be totally different.
But the core of its service will still be the same.
Helping people. Guiding users. Making lives better.
That is the foundation Google was built on.
Google will continue to evolve and adapt. It will keep up with the technology
revolution, and how we humans embrace it. The whiz-kid engineers, scientists and
sociologists
who
guide
the
company’s
growth
will
make
sure
they
do
EVERYTHING possible to remain the best friend, philosopher and guide you
know, love and trust.
This is critical for Google’s future success. The Internet of Things (IoT) is just
around the corner. Expect Google (and other companies) to target this market as
well. Getting access to data from your home, learning about you, matching your
needs to relevant offers and making sure you come back for more will be key to the
search giant’s strategy for survival and success.
What seems like science ﬁction today will be something we’ll look back at a few
years later as being the digital Stone Age. Things will only be more dynamic and
complex. That’s great for consumers, for students of technology and business, and
overall for humanity. But succeeding in business will not be easy or guaranteed. It
will require regularly updated knowledge, unlearning of outdated tactics and a
changed mindset.
4.7
Who Wins in This Fast-Evolving Scenario?
Here’s what businesses need to understand. Tomorrow’s winners aren’t those who
look at Google as a search engine, or limit its role to search marketing or ranking
for certain keywords. No, they are people who think differently. And follow a
different approach. One that understands exactly how Google is critical to their
ﬁnancial results.
What does the future hold in store for businesses and companies?
With a plethora of options to choose from, the winners will be those who look to
analytics data as a tool for strategic management. They’ll see data and trends as
revealing opportunities to seize, and won’t consider time and resources spent on it
as a hassle or waste. The future—of Google and businesses—is ALL ABOUT
HUMANS. They’ll need to pick our brains, dig into our thoughts and feelings,
understand our needs and wants (including those we may not even be aware of yet!)
Everything is seamlessly connected and integrated. There isn’t a distinction any
longer between ‘ofﬂine’ and ‘online’ business. And the rich data available for
analysis heralds the end of qualiﬁed guesswork and gut feeling in making business
decisions.
Google is smarter than all the brains in the world—combined! Its arrays of
servers, with their tera- and peta-bytes of stored data, work day and night to guide
us, helping us safely and conﬁdently navigate the uncertain seas of our everyday
4

existence. Not just helping us ﬁnd opportunities and see more options, but assisting
us with decisions as well, guiding us to the right match.
The world’s most powerful matchmaking service has transformed business and
sales. And to the extent that businesses can leverage this shift, they will thrive and
succeed. Search engine optimization is the means to that end.

Chapter 5
Search Engine Optimization: Getting
to Google’s First Page
Frank Buddenbrock
5.1
Google’s First Page
You’ve got an established business, or perhaps, are just starting one. Or you’re a
professional with highly sought-after talents and you produce successful outcomes
for your clients. In either of these scenarios, to market you or your business (they
could be the same thing) effectively, in 2015 you’re going to have to build a great
website. It’s pretty much expected—if your customer base/clients can’t ﬁnd you
online either using their desktop computer or their mobile device, they’re going to
assume you don’t know what you’re doing, and they’ll search out someone else.
With the more than 1 billion websites now available (as of August 2016
according to internetlivestats.com), it’s critical, downright crucial, to get found if
you want your venture to grow, or even survive. And you’re going to have to be
found on Google’s ﬁrst page at the optimum, or on page two at the least—the very
least as you’ll see shortly.
In the current environment, people just aren’t going to search much past page
one. If they don’t see you there, they’re going to assume they searched using the
wrong phrase, and they’ll go back to the search bar and try again. But they’re not
too likely to venture onto page two. If you’re on page 3 or beyond, you could just as
well be on page 300 for all the good it’ll do.
According to recent research, 94 % of searchers do not go past page one—that
leaves an incredibly dismal 6 % who dare to explore page two. And it’s equally
frightening how searching drops off even on the Holy Grail ﬁrst page. The number
one position gets more than 34 % of the impressions, position 10… only 2.7 %.
OUCH! And position 20, that dark and lonely place on the bottom of page two…
only 0.29 %!

Position Number One on Google’s First page not only gets 34 % of the
impressions, but more importantly, it also gets more than a third of all the clicks.
That’s why it’s vital to be on Google’s ﬁrst page, and above the fold, that part of the
screen that’s visible without scrolling.
In a recent blog post, a gentleman wrote: I use “Google suggest, then top 3
listings. That’s how I search, mostly. Sometimes down to result number 5 or 6,
depending on the size of the screen. I’ve heard it said, though, that Page 1 is for
information seekers, mostly. Wonder if this has any credence. Either way I don’t
really care. If a site is not on Page 1, result 1–7, then it has failed. Period.”
Pretty sobering, don’t you think?
5.2
Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
The new marketing paradigm, marketing your business online, has at its core,
visibility. And as illustrated above, pages one and two of a Google Search result is
where you need to be seen.
So just how do we get to that digital hallowed ground? Through a process called
Search Engine Optimization, more commonly known as SEO. What we want to do
is “optimize” our website so that Google will favor us over other similar websites
and put ours at, or near, the top of the page when someone does a search. This is
also known as SERP—search engine results page.
Google is quite open about what it expects from a website to get it to rank well;
in fact, they spell it out simply and clearly in their Search Engine Optimization
Starter Guide. By following their Best Practices suggestions, you’ll make it easier
for the search engine software (fondly referred to as Googlebot or spider) to crawl,
index and make sense of your website’s content.
The primary goal of the Google search engine is to provide the best possible
experience for the user, that person who just made a search or query. And it’s pretty
easy to understand why Google would want that.
Google wants to be your ﬁrst, and perhaps only, choice for online searches
because when you use them for your searching, you’re more likely to see and then
click on one of the myriad ads populating those search results pages. That’s where
Google makes the bulk of their revenue. Each ad placement, whether at the top of
the page, bottom of the page, or running down the side, is paid for by the advertiser
(yup, each time you click on one of those ads that advertiser just paid Google for
that opportunity).
Now that you understand Google’s objective, you can see that they want to
display those websites that they believe will give the user/searcher the best possible
experience. They want websites that best answer the user’s query and provide
recent and relevant information. They want to display websites with good and
useful content, including text, graphics, images and videos. As is commonly said
about marketing online, “Content is King.”
196
F. Buddenbrock

The process that helps Google determine where your website should rank
involves Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Google uses approximately 200
variables/factors in their proprietary algorithm to determine where a website should
rank. Obviously, they keep those 200 variables a closely guarded secret, but
through testing and observing, the SEO community has been able to discover the
most important factors. Let’s explore those factors.
5.3
Keywords
Simply put, keywords, and keyword phrases, are those words and phrases a
searcher types into the Google Search bar. It may be a single word, though unless
it’s extremely unique, the search will return results that are much too general.
Typically, a searcher will type in compound keywords such as “red leather purse”
or “off road tires” when looking for something. Or they may even type in entire
sentences or questions seeking results, such as “What do I do if I ﬁnd out I’m
diabetic?” In this example, I’d say the keywords are “ﬁnd out I’m diabetic.”
When marketing online, keywords are THE most important elements for
everything you’ll do because those keywords/phrases are going to be those words
people are typing into the search bar. And you’ll want your website to be in the
search results they see. Those keywords will drive all of your marketing efforts—
websites, blogs, social media posts, image names, link text (also known as anchor
text), press releases, forum content and so on.
One of the ﬁrst and most important tasks you’ll need to do is determine the best
keywords to use—what are the terms your potential visitor is typing into their
search bar. It may not always be what YOU think is best. This is especially true if
you use industry jargon and terms not used by the general public.
For example, while the phrase “professional hair-cutting shears” may accurately
describe that tool your hair stylist uses when cutting your hair, through keyword
research you’ll discover that “professional hair-cutting scissors” is searched con-
siderably more often. Using keyword research software, we see that “professional
hair-cutting shears” was searched 468 times in a month, while “professional
hair-cutting scissors” was searched 1920 times. It’s pretty easy to see which
keyword/phrase will likely generate the most trafﬁc to a website. That’s not to say
we won’t use “professional hair-cutting shears” but rather we’ll concentrate and put
more of our efforts on “professional hair-cutting scissors.”
You’ll want to perform this same exercise for all those keywords and phrases
relevant to you, your products and/or services. It’s helpful to use a spreadsheet to
keep track of your results because you’ll be using these throughout your
marketing/SEO efforts. Once you’ve collected your list of keywords, the work
begins.

5.4
SEO Ranking Factors
Let’s look at some of the more important SEO ranking factors that we have control
over.
5.4.1
Site Speed
We are seeing the search engines giving more and more importance to how quickly
a website loads—in fact, it’s becoming one of the top ranking factors. Be sure to
keep images no larger than necessary (they take longer to load than text), and keep
ads and content from third-party sites to a minimum. You are often at their mercy
for how quickly something may load from their site or server. The slower your site
loads, the lower Google will rank your site, all other things being equal.
5.4.2
Title Tag
One of the most important ranking factors is the title tag. Think of it as the title of a
book and you can see how important it is. It helps the visitor understand what the
page is about, and also helps the search engines index and rank your page. Be sure
to write a unique title tag for every page of your website. Again, if you think of it as
the title of a book, you’d want a unique and different title for each book to reduce
any confusion for your visitor, as well as for the search engines.
The title tag is already familiar to most people—it’s that blue line of text you see
for each listing on a search results page. That title tag is written behind the scenes in
the html coding of a web page. It is highly recommended to have a least one of your
major keywords in your title tag, and if possible have it as early as possible. If our
keyword/phrase is “dog training” you should write a title tag like this:
DOG TRAINING | Dog Obedience Training | Train Your Dog
Using variations of your keyword phrase is quite effective. You see that we used
“Dog Training” and “Train Your Dog,” plus a similar phrase “Dog Obedience
Training.” By using title tags like this, there is no doubt what this page is about. It is
recommended to use the pipe (horizontal line) to separate your keywords/phrases,
and to keep them in the 65–70 character range.
5.4.3
Meta Description
The meta description is that text displayed below the Title tag and website url in a
search result. This presents an opportunity in 160 characters or less to add
198
F. Buddenbrock

information that supports or continues the idea presented in the title tag. Write meta
descriptions that inform and interest users. Each page of your website should have
its own unique meta description. This text is part of the behind-the-scenes html
code in the header of a page and is used by Google to display in their search results.
The meta description is a great place to include even more keyword phrase
variations and synonyms. It’s a fantastic opportunity (missed by most people) to
write compelling copy and offer a call-to-action to get a potential visitor to click on
your search result link. If you have space and can’t think of anything to add, at least
add your phone number to make it easy for people to contact you.
5.4.4
Heading Tags
Heading tags can be thought of as the sub-headings on a web page. They start with
H1 and can run up to H6. Each page should only have one H1 tag, but may have
several succeeding smaller heading tags. You could have several H2 tags, followed
by several H3 tags and so on. Here again, if possible, include a keyword/phrase or
variation of it.
One important idea to keep in mind when writing the content for your website is
to make it read well.
Resist the temptation to overdo it with keywords and phrases. Your writing
should read the way people speak. People are pretty sharp—they’ll catch on pretty
quick if your writing is too focused on stufﬁng your content with keywords with the
hope of gaining favor with the search engines. And the search engine software is
quite smart as well—it is able to determine if you’re trying too hard to stuff your
content with keywords. If it catches you doing this, you could be penalized rather
than rewarded.
If all this sounds challenging—it is. A good and talented Search Engine
Optimization expert (also known as an SEO) will work very hard to get your major
keyword phrases included in all the necessary places as well as the content on your
page, and make it read well all while pleasing the search engines. A good SEO is
like a master chef—they have access to the same ingredients you do but are able to
put together just the right combinations of ingredients in just the right proportions to
make a beautiful presentation. They deﬁnitely bring a little bit of artistic talent to
the project.
5.4.5
Keyword in URL/Keyword in Domain Name
When possible, it’s recommended to include your keyword in a web page’s url,
especially if you are not able to get a domain name that includes your keyword.
Most simple and common (and many not-so-simple or common) domain names are
taken—DOGTRAINING.COM for example. But ABCKENNELDOGTRAINING.
5
Search Engine Optimization: Getting to Google’s First Page
199

COM may be available. Don’t go too crazy to try to get your keyword in your
domain name, and don’t make it too long or cumbersome.
While you may not be able to get a domain name that includes your major
keyword, you should include your major keywords in the url of sub-pages, those
pages that are not the home page.
Your dog training page’s url could be: ABCKENNEL.com/dog-training for
example. Follow this example for the remaining pages, such as: ABCKENNEL.
COM/obedience-training-school.
5.4.6
Keywords in Body Text
When writing the body text for each page of your site include your keywords and
variations throughout the text. Include your keywords early in the text, in the ﬁrst
one or two sentences, and try to ﬁnish the page with a keyword phrase or variation.
Sprinkle those keywords in following paragraphs, but remember to keep it readable
—don’t stuff your content with keywords.
Another useful tool is modifying the attributes of the text for those keywords by
making the text bold or italicized. This helps those keywords stand out from the
surrounding text making it easier for your users to see what this page is about. The
search engines also like those emphasized keywords for indexing your content.
5.4.7
Media
When planning the content for your pages, including images, graphics and videos
are useful tools not only for your user, but for the search engines as well.
Images, graphics, and videos are an often overlooked opportunity to make use of
your keywords. First, use your keywords when naming your media. For example,
an image titled “dog-training-in-park.jpg” is much better than “image1.jpg.” The
same idea applies when naming graphics used on your site, as well as videos
inserted into a page.
Additionally, and especially for images and graphics, be sure to make use of the
ALT attribute. This is often overlooked and is a valuable SEO opportunity. The
“ALT” attribute allows you to write alternative keyword-rich text for an image or
graphic if for some reason it cannot be displayed. You’ll see ALT text display when
you hover over an image or graphic.
The “ALT” attribute was originally developed for sight-challenged people who
would use a screen reader to describe the contents of a web page. The search
engines use the ALT text of an image similarly to the anchor text of a text link.
Optimizing your image and graphic ﬁlenames and ALT text makes it easier for
Google Image Search to understand and index your images. Google will often
display images in their ﬁrst page of search results and you increase your chances of
200
F. Buddenbrock

being displayed when making use of the ALT attribute and keyword-rich image and
ﬁlenames. This functionality comes and goes as Google sees ﬁt.
5.4.8
Sitemaps
A simple HTML sitemap listing the all the pages of your website can be useful.
Think of a sitemap as being similar to a Table of Contents or Index for your user.
Include all the important pages of your website and their links. Be sure to organize
them properly by subject or category.
You should also create and include an XML sitemap to ensure that the search
engines can ﬁnd and index the pages of your site. Once you’ve created the XML
sitemap, upload it through your Google Webmaster Tools account to inform the
search engines. Be aware that the search engines may not indicate that they have
indexed every single page listed in your sitemap. For example, you may upload 250
pages/links and the Google may only show that it has indexed 220 pages. Google
does not guarantee that they will index all the pages/urls from your website.
5.4.9
Anchor Text
Write anchor text that is useful for your users and the search engines.
Anchor text is that clickable text that is used for links that direct a user to other
content or to another page. Well-written anchor text tells your user and the search
engines something about the content or page that you are linking to. Here is an
example of a well-written anchor tag:
<a href=http://www.abckennel.com/potty-training/ Potty Training Your Dog></a>
You can see that this is much clearer and more accurately describes the content
rather than:
<a href=“http://www.abckennel.com/potty-training/”>Click Here</a>
“Click Here” offers no value for the user, nor for the search engines.
Make it easy for users and search engines to distinguish anchor text from regular
text—typically anchor text links are a different color from the surrounding text,
and/or is underlined. This has become the standard for indicating link text.
5.4.10
Social Media
Social media and “social signals” are becoming increasingly important as an SEO
ranking factor. Google continues to consider social signals as indicators of the
5
Search Engine Optimization: Getting to Google’s First Page
201

importance of a website. The different social media platforms Google considers
important are:
Google+
Facebook
Pinterest
Twitter
YouTube
Content from these platforms that link to a website improve its SEO rankings.
5.4.11
Backlinking
Links from relevant websites have long been an important SEO ranking factor.
Links should be from high-quality sites and the more you have the better.
Google views links from another website as a vote for your site, and considers
them a trust factor. You should work to getting links from “authority” websites—
websites that are considered reputable and trustworthy.
Google may penalize you for having too many backlinks from completely
unrelated websites. Many lazy SEO companies try to game the system by ﬂooding a
website with unrelated links. Google may even penalize those sites by deleting all
of a website’s indexed pages. Links to a website typically come gradually, not all at
once, and come from people who have discovered your site through natural pro-
cesses such as blog posts, press releases, Facebook and Twitter posts, and related
articles. Unnatural linking could actually be detrimental to the reputation of your
website.
5.5
SEO Done Properly
While not terribly difﬁcult (though not much is terribly difﬁcult when you know all
the proper techniques and processes—being a master chef, for example, as alluded
to earlier), SEO done properly is a lengthy, complex process. Research can be
time-consuming. Creating interesting content for your user that compels them to
stay on your website long enough to decide whether they want to develop a rela-
tionship with you is time-consuming and may require the talents of a real copy-
writer. Promoting your website through blogs, press releases, and social media and
article sites is also time-consuming. Producing images, graphics and videos to
increase the value of your site for both the user and the search engines takes special
skills, talents, and possibly large budgets. Developing relationships with other
people and websites that like your content and want to share it with THEIR fol-
lowers takes time, diligence and fortitude. The good thing is that when done
202
F. Buddenbrock

intelligently, methodically, and effectively, getting to Google’s ﬁrst page can be
within your reach.
5.6
SEO Case Study
One of my ﬁrst SEO clients was Eileen Koch who owns a self-named Los
Angeles-based Public Relations ﬁrm—in fact, she is still a client nearly 10 years
later.
Eileen contacted me when the business directory website she was listed with
suddenly vanished from Google’s indexed pages. We learned later that the
owner/developer of the site had tried to “game the system” and that is deﬁnitely
something Google won’t stand for. So Google simply removed that site from its
index.
The sad thing is, there really is no reason to break, nor bend, the rules Google
lays out. When you follow Google’s rules (what they call their Best Practices), a
properly optimized website can show up on Google’s ﬁrst page. I know—I’ve done
it more than 60 times.
Eileen needed a new strategy—the business directory had been her major lead
generator and had been responsible for many phone calls from prospective clients.
Now it was crickets—the phone stopped ringing.
She contacted me, told me of her debacle, and I recommended that we perform
an audit of her website. Unfortunately for her, we discovered that there was vir-
tually no optimization done on her website—almost no on-page optimization, and
no off-page optimization at all.
Her site couldn’t be found in the ﬁrst 50 Google search results pages. Of this I’m
certain—I sat one evening in front of my muted TV with my laptop and literally
went through each and every of the ﬁrst 50 pages and didn’t see ANY mention of
her nor her website.
In a sense this wasn’t a terrible starting point—at least there was nothing we
would have to undo. We were working with a fresh website which allowed us to
perform a complete optimization. We of course started with an extensive Keyword
Research program. Once we compiled our list, we discussed it with Eileen and
agreed on which keywords were best, and most relevant, for her business and
website. Not only would these keywords/phrases be used as the basis of the opti-
mization campaign, it would be the foundation of all future marketing efforts.
These keywords were uploaded to the meta Title, meta Description, and meta
Keyword ﬁelds for each page of her site. We made sure to include variations,
combinations, and synonyms. We also made sure to include these terms within the
300+ words on each page, and made certain terms bold and/or italicized. Using our
major keywords spreadsheet made easy work of developing anchor text intra-site
links, as well as inter-site links.
5
Search Engine Optimization: Getting to Google’s First Page
203

For the next few months we continued to optimize the site until ﬁve months later
I searched for one of our major keyword phrases, and lo and behold, there we were
on the bottom of page one! I couldn’t wait to call Eileen to share the good news.
I called her up and asked her to perform a Google Search, expecting her to
scream in delight to see her website on the ﬁrst page. However, she promptly and
disappointedly told me she could not see her site listed there. Yes, I said, it’s right
there at the bottom of page one—I’m looking at it, I see it on my screen.
No, she said, it’s not there. I sat there dumbfounded. How could I see it on my
screen, yet she couldn’t see it on hers? It was then that I learned that a Mac
computer running Safari displays different results than a PC running Firefox. We
learned why she couldn’t see her website on page one, and it wasn’t until another
few agonizing/confusing/frustrating days that her Mac running Safari displayed her
site on page one. EUREKA!
And after a few more weeks, Eileen’s site was ultimately #1 for her major
keyword phrase, “Los Angeles Public Relations ﬁrm.”
As of August 2016, Eileen’s site is on Google’s ﬁrst page in the fourth position.
The number one spot goes to Odwyer’s business directory of PR ﬁrms. (Directories
are very, very difﬁcult to beat. They rank well typically because of their abundance
of content, multiple pages and near-continuous addition of fresh, relevant content.)
Eileen’s site has remained on Google’s ﬁrst page for over 10 years. A steady
trickle of relevant content, intermittent modiﬁcations to meta data, and a strategic
back-linking campaign can keep a website ranking well, high up in Google’s search
results.
I hope that your optimization efforts bring you similar results.
Good luck.

4 Tips for Writing Outstanding SEO
Boosting Content
Tina Courtney
6.1
The SEO Game
Custom content; it is the essence of the SEO game, its very heart and soul. This is
how your company will spread its gospel wide and far, gaining massive public
awareness and droves of visitors to your site. Without creatively written, unique,
and highly informative content, your site is likely to gain little to no foothold as this
copy is what lets the masses know you have high-quality information to provide.
And the public simply cannot get enough of the delicious insights delivered through
top-notch content (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-content-marketing-your-
businesss-bff-tina-kat-courtney?trk=mp-reader-card).
People aren’t the only ones who love compelling content; Google absolutely
adores it. Lives for it, even. The search giant is constantly improving its algorithms
to present the most relevant, informative, and downright enlightening search
experience possible. In February 2011, Google even created a speciﬁc algorithm
that aims to eradicate lackluster content, affectionately called Panda (http://
searchengineland.com/library/google/google-panda-update).
While this update may sound all cute and cuddly, it is anything but. Google’s
Panda is more of a seek-and-destroy algorithm that obliterates thin or low quality
sites and content by sinking it in the SERPs, rarely to ever see the light of day again.
Sounds intense right? Google is fully aware of how important superb content has
become to the average internet dweller and is on a mission to provide nothing less
than spectacular results.
Google summed up Panda by stating, “Our recent update is designed to reduce
rankings for low-quality sites, so the key thing for webmasters to do is make sure
their sites are the highest quality possible. We looked at a variety of signals to
detect low quality sites. Bear in mind that people searching on Google typically

205

don’t want to see shallow or poorly written content, content that’s copied from
other websites, or information that are just not that useful. In addition, it’s
important for webmasters to know that low quality content on part of a site can
impact a site’s ranking as a whole.”
If
a
site
contains
unoriginal
content,
thin
content,
duplicate
content,
poorly-written content, content that is not useful, has a poor ad-to-content ratio, or
does not have a pleasant UX, prepare to get buried. If you do manage to pass this
strict criteria, Google will then take a look at engagement and awareness metrics to
determine if your site belongs on the front page. Your site must legitimate,
intriguing, and top-notch to meet Google’s high standards.
If you were on the receiving end of Panda’s wrath, here is a checklist (http://
googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.ca/2011/05/more-guidance-on-building-high-
quality.html) to determine where you may have gone wrong.
With Google’s extreme emphasis on content, great copy provides the keys to
site-salvation. In order to produce lauded and celebrated content, there are some
practices that must be diligently implemented across the board. So without further
ado, here are the top SEO tips to get your site at the top of the SERPs.
6.2
Tip #1: The Audience Comes First
Without a fan-base to read your content, there is no point in producing it in the ﬁrst
place, so be sure to always put these folks ﬁrst in your writing. Try to put yourself
in their shoes for a moment—do you want to read content that is jam-packed with
keywords? Do you want to see your favorite brands posting materials that are
completely off-topic for their niche? Do you want to read a hefty article or blog that
leaves you none-the-wiser at the end? Of course not, so don’t provide anything like
this to your audience either, or beware the wrath of Panda.
With all that Google has done to provide its users a top-of-the-line experience,
stufﬁng content with keywords is genuinely much more harmful than beneﬁcial.
Content that isn’t relevant to your audience will get tossed to the side and forgotten
faster than it took to write it. Utilizing any of these black hat SEO tactics will
ultimately damage your site in the rankings and degrade public opinion of your
business. And with today’s competition, you can’t afford this kind of backwards
movement.
The only thing that consumers and Google care about is thoughtfully crafted
content that provides a fresh, informative, and extremely relevant perspective on
topics.
To successfully achieve the art of writing pristine copy, don’t fuss over things
like keywords; these are still important but will almost always be woven naturally
throughout your piece. Focus on acquiring original information through studies or
polls, shift the paradigm on subject matter and provide an entirely new perspective
so as to not regurgitate the same opinion, and most importantly, focus on the
206
T. Courtney

pain-points and relevant issues that are most pressing to your audience. By putting
these ﬁrst, your site will begin to gain the credibility and authority that it needs and
deserves.
6.3
Tip #2: Backlink Like You Mean It
Backlinks are another valued component to dominating SEO. Much like the content
element, however, backlinks should be approached with a rather discerning eye.
There is an old black hat tactic of back-linking anything that a site could get its
proverbial hands on; this is no longer relevant and will only succeed in helping to
demolish a site’s reputation and ranking status.
In April of 2012, one year after the unveiling of Panda, Google introduced
another warm and fuzzy algorithm update into the mix; this one would be dubbed
Penguin.
Penguin has a single mission; to eradicate spam from the internet through
downgrading sites that use spamming techniques to obtain better rankings in
SERPs. Any site that is utilizes unnatural links, spam-like links, paid links, article
directory links, links from sites with low-quality content, or anything else that
appears questionable will be sent into abysmal Google standings.
Be sure to only set your sites on links that are quality and reputable such as news
organizations, esteemed sources that are relevant to your material, sites with high
trust ﬂow metrics, and credible blogs. Do keep in mind, however, that creating too
many backlinks on your site will be detrimental to your efforts as well. If you do
ﬁnd that you have been hit by the Penguin update, it is possible to recover, for
everything is impermanent.
Google’s disavow tool (https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/disavow-
links-main?pli=1) is easy to use and can help get your site out of hot water. The
disavow tool is Google’s provided resource for allowing site owners to ask for
certain links to not be counted. This tool is an absolute blessing to webmasters, but
be certain that you are only disavowing links that are manipulating the results,
otherwise your site can be harmed in the process. There are some great resources
available online which provide a step-by-step tutorial (https://moz.com/blog/guide-
to-googles-disavow-tool) of how to complete this process and be well on your way
to getting back into Google’s good graces.
6.4
Tip #3: Extra, Extra, Read All About It
Remember this little saying as the newspaper boy would wave around the current
days copy and quote the front page headline? This was done because the headline is
the hook to reel in readers. And despite the evolution in how people read the news,
the power of headlines has not faltered.
6
4 Tips for Writing Outstanding SEO Boosting Content
207

Headlines must be engaging, gripping, and eye-catching in order to be
click-worthy. The internet is littered with copy, content, images, quotes, stories, and
so forth; there is simply too much information available online for readers to be
hooked by a drab headline. No matter how epic, legendary, or poetic your piece
may be, it will never reach your audience without a title that packs a wallop. In fact,
only 2 out of every 10 individuals is likely to read past the headline (http://www.
copyblogger.com/magnetic-headlines/), so make it count.
While it may be tempting, avoid developing “click-bait” at all costs. This type of
misdirection will only serve to disappoint and possibly infuriate your audience
while simultaneously contaminating your reputation as a thought-leader in your
niche.
To develop some attention-grabbing headlines that clearly reﬂect the content
ahead, focus on cultivating expressions that echo the value contained within that
readers can look forward to. Seek to insight inquisitive interest, deep wonderment,
or even shock; anything that will strike an emotional chord for readers without
misleading them. Utilize keywords and phrases that mirror what the piece is about
too.
One great way to learn about the types of headlines you are aiming for is to
research popular blogs within your niche and gain inspiration from their most
successful posts. This will give you an understanding of successful structures,
keywords, and general appeal. Alternatively, the internet houses a multitude of
magniﬁcent tools to help you achieve headline gold. Tools like CoSchedule’s

terful headlines.

Tip #4: Visual Voodoo
Visual content can cast a spell on folks and lead them down hours upon hours of
YouTube videos, Vines, gifs, and so on. Think this sounds a bit exaggerated?
Consider this: over 6 billion hours of video is watched on YouTube each and every
month (http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/youtube-statistics/). It is predicted
that by 2018, nearly one million minutes of video will be published online every
single second. The bottom line here is that people cannot get enough visuals
incorporated into their content.
Last year, images accompanied 75 % of all posts made to Facebook (http://
www.socialbakers.com/blog/2149-photos-are-still-king-on-facebook). Tweets with
accompanying images receive 18 % more clicks, 89 % more favorites, and 150 %
more
retweets
(http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-
strategy) than those that don’t. In just 2 years, infographic search volume explo-
ded by more than 800 % (http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/infographics-
everything-you-need-to-know/). Without a captivating image to accompany that

artfully crafted article or post, it will simply be drowned out in a barrage of visuals,
both static and dynamic.
For your social posts, blogs, articles, or whatever else to stand any chance, it is
imperative that the content is coupled with a high-resolution, interesting, and rel-
evant image, video, or gif. This will help draw the reader’s eye to your post before
they continue on. Once you have gained their attention, your highly clickable
headline is there to ﬁnish the job and gain that coveted click-through.
All of the information discussed here should be taken to heart and integrated into
your SEO blueprint as soon as possible, for high quality content will always be the
backbone of SEO success. Visual content is well on its way to becoming just as
critical. It’s a simple yet immensely powerful recipe.
As the internet and SEO continues its evolution, people’s standards for quality
content will only continue to advance and Google’s rules and regulations will grow
increasingly stricter. Do your business a favor and learn to become a master
craftsman (or craftswoman) when it comes to content; there are plenty of tools and
resources available online to help you along the way. All you need is a strong drive
for success, a heavy dose of creativity, and the nerve to stand out from the crowd.
Add a little consistency and you are light years above your competition. Google—
and the world—will take notice.

Internet Advertising and Google AdWords
Nicole Ciomek
7.1
The Importance of Internet Advertising
The Internet has changed how businesses of all sizes market their products and
services. No longer do businesses have to rely on the Yellow Pages, newspaper ads,
or TV spots. The Internet has opened up a new venue for reaching potential cus-
tomers, one that is more tailored and accountable. Businesses have the ability to
truly understand what the return on investment is with online advertising. It is not
about circulation or how many people drive by a particular billboard each day.
Advertisers have the ability to know how many people clicked on an ad every day,
what search led them to the website, how long they spent on the website, and
whether they purchased or ﬁlled out a lead form.
Online advertising allows businesses to make the most of their advertising
dollars. Any business can ﬁnd success with the right online advertising program set
up in the correct manner. But where does one start?
The answer is simple: Google. Google is the largest search engine on the planet.
In 2014, Google reported that there were 5.7 billion searches completed per day
worldwide. With the majority of Internet users turning to Google to help them ﬁnd
the information, services and products they need, Google chose to monetize their
search engine through paid advertisements.
Google began selling advertising in October 2000 through the Google AdWords
platform. AdWords has since become the largest online advertising marketplace.

7.2
Google AdWords
Google AdWords is a keyword search advertising platform. This means that
advertisers select what keywords they’d like their ads show on, then they create the
ad copy that will show when a web user searches for that particular term. Ads are
displayed to users on Google.com at both the top and right hand sides of the page
(see Fig. 7.1). Ads include a link that will send users to a relevant page on their
website.
AdWords is a pay per click (PPC) marketplace. This means that Google only
charges advertisers when a user clicks on one of their ads.
The AdWords marketplace is an auction. Advertisers tell Google what they are
willing to pay for each ad click for a particular keyword search. Google then utilizes
this information plus the relevancy of the ad copy and landing page to determine
what order the ads show on a particular search. Advertisers bidding higher and with
strong relevancy, will show up on higher on the page and garner more clicks.

7.3
AdWords Ads: What Google Is Selling
7.3.1
What an AdWords Ad Looks like
Ads that appear on Google are quite concise and to the point. There is a limited
amount of space to convey what’s on offer, why a user should visit the site, and
why it is better than its competitors. The ad copy is how users are drawn in. What
makes a user click? To understand that, you ﬁrst need to understand what goes into
an ad (see Fig. 7.2).
7.3.2
The Different Parts of an Ad
Each AdWords ad is composed of a headline, two lines of description, the display
URL and the destination URL.
Headline
The headline is the top line of text that will be the link to the page. Google gives
you 25 characters for this line. This is the part of the ad that will catch the users’
eye. Make this highly relevant to the keywords in the ad group. Putting keywords
from the ad group in the ad copy will help your quality score greatly. It increases ad
relevancy. Since the headline is the most eye catching part of an ad copy, putting
keywords into the headline will draw in users since the headline will match or be
closely related to what they just searched for. You also want the headline to be
intriguing. Try including high value words like best, top, and #1. You can also ask a
question in the headline.
Description
The description is 2 lines each of which can be 35 characters in length. Here is the
meat of your ad. This is where you give users additional information. You’ll want
to make sure your description contains two components: a value proposition and a
call to action. The value proposition can be anything that makes your business
more compelling than a competitor. Free Shipping, Lowest prices, Rated #1, and so
forth. Think about what sets your business or products apart from the rest. Think
about what might compel a user to do business with you and get that in here. The
call to action should come toward the end of the ad and should describe the action
you want the user to take. It can be anything from Shop Now to Call Today to
Fig. 7.2 Ad copy
7
Internet Advertising and Google AdWords
213

Learn More. Think about what the action is you want user to complete and make
sure you include this in every ad.
Display URL
The display URL is the ﬁnal part of the ad that shows on Google.com when a user
searches. This will be the URL of your website. This is pretty straightforward, but
there are ways to utilize this more fully. Putting a “/” after the URL can be another
place to increase relevancy. For example, you could just put WomenShoes.com.
But, WomenShoes.com/HighHeels will be even more relevant to a user looking for
high heeled shoes. Make the most of that space to get some additional keywords in
the ad.
Destination URL
This is the page where you’ll send users. They do not see this, but as we’ll review
later, selecting a relevant one is highly important.
7.3.3
What Makes an Ad Compelling?
Creating compelling ad copy takes work with such limited space to communicate
with your users. When composing ads, there are a few key points that will help you
get to create engaging ads:
– Be direct Your space is limited, say what you need to say in as few characters as
possible. This will allow you to ﬁt in as much information as possible to your
potential customer and help users to quickly understand what products or ser-
vices you offer.
– Be speciﬁc Make ads in each ad copy speciﬁc and unique. Tailor the ads in each
ad group to those keywords. This will lead to more clicks and higher quality
trafﬁc than a vague, generic ad.
– Know your audience Knowing who your ideal customer is will help you to write
better ad copy. Write out a description of who you see your customer as before
you create ad copy. This will put you in the right mindset.
7.4
AdWords Campaigns: The Advertiser’s Structure
7.4.1
What Is a Campaign?
AdWords is organized around campaigns. The best way to think of a campaign is
the way you would any marketing campaign: a campaign is the avenue by which
you’ll advertise for a certain set of products or services to your targeted market. In
AdWords, campaigns are the umbrella under which ads are managed.
214
N. Ciomek

The campaign is where an advertiser decides what users they want to target.
Here they can set what hours of the day ads run, in what locations ads will run in
(this can be anything from zip codes to countries), and most importantly, what
keywords will be used.
7.4.2
How to Select a Campaign Structure
Before you get started with your campaigns, you need to contemplate what you
want to advertise for and what your goals are. Are you advertising for a series of
products? Do you have variety of services you offer or just one? Are you looking
into increase brand awareness? Or do you want to increase sales?
You need to have a strong understanding of what you want to accomplish with
these campaigns as this will help to determine your campaign structure.
Determining how to organize your campaigns is the ﬁrst step to running a
successful AdWords account. The best practice is to create campaigns for different
products or different services. If an advertiser is a women’s clothing retailer and
they want to advertise for a variety of products they sell, the best format would be to
have a campaign for dresses, then one for pants, another for tops and so forth. If the
advertiser is a service provider, like a dentist, then campaigns should be divided up
by service: cleanings, tooth implants, gum disease treatment and so on.
7.4.3
How Campaign Structure Impacts Performance
and Optimization
Creating a clean and logical campaign structure is essential as it allows you to
quickly understand the performance of your campaigns and determine which
products and services are performing well, and which are not. This also allows you
to designate different budgets to different product lines, pause a campaign if you no
longer want to advertise for that service and informs you which campaigns need
improvement.
Taking the time to ﬁgure out a campaign structure ﬁrst will make optimizations
easier, and allows for an advertiser to utilize their time most efﬁciently.
There is no one-size-ﬁts-all approach to campaign organization: the best struc-
ture is the one that ﬁts the marketing strategy of the business and allows for ﬂexible
growth.

7.5
Keywords: How Ads Are Targeted
Picking the correct keywords is the most important part of an AdWords campaign.
These keywords determine when your ads will show, how a user will ﬁnd you and
learn about your business. Selecting a list that is relevant to your business is
extremely important. Choosing keywords that are not relevant can result in wasted
budget and driving users to your site who are unlikely to be interested in what you
have to offer. To get a strong keyword list, you must begin with keyword research.
7.5.1
How to Go About Keyword Research
Keyword research can be done in a variety of ways, but is best undertaken in a
logical and organized manner.
First, look at your ﬁrst campaign. What products will you be selling here? Let’s
say it’s shoes. You could advertise on the word “shoes” but a user searching for
shoes could have a variety of intentions. When picking keywords, it is essential to
think about what a user’s intent would when they search for a particular keyword.
Why would someone search for the word “shoes”? They may be interested in
purchasing shoes. Or they may be looking for historical information on shoes. Or
they might be looking for pictures of shoes. It is difﬁcult to say. If it is difﬁcult to
say what the user’s intention is, it is important to narrow your focus further. Who
are these shoes for? Let’s say they are women’s shoes. This already narrows your
focus. Are they dress shoes? Casual shoes? This can narrow the focus further.
Take the time to brainstorm a list of keyword related to the products or service
you want to advertise for in that campaign. Look at your landing page. Think about
what’s on that page. Use the content from that page to help you brainstorm.
Once you’ve brainstormed a list, you can then utilize Google’s Keyword Planner
tool (see Fig. 7.3). This tool helps you to ﬁnd different variations of these keywords
and potentially some related terms you had not thought of. You can copy your list
of brainstormed keywords into the search box, and then check off the keywords
Google has found for you that you like. This will all be exported into an Excel ﬁle.
Finally, go over this list one more time. Write down any other variations that
come to mind. Think of different modiﬁers: Leather women’s shoes, black women’s
shoes, cheap women’s shoes, buy women’s shoes. Any word that can be added to
the key phrase of what you are advertising for will help to give you better coverage
on Google searches and help you to determine which keywords will work best for
your business.
216
N. Ciomek

7.5.2
How to Determine if You’ve Got a Strong Keyword
List
Once you’ve ﬁnished your keyword research phase, go over the list of keywords
once again. This may seem tedious, but this is probably the most important phase of
creating an ad campaign. If you start with keywords that are way too generic, you
could easily waste a good amount of your advertising budget. It is essential to take
keyword selection seriously and be very thoughtful in this phase. This will help you
to reach success as quickly as possible.
In this ﬁnal review, eliminate any keywords that you feel uncertain about. You
can always test them out later. When most advertisers start using AdWords, they are
trying to determine if AdWords will work for them. You want to give yourself the
best chances of success. Any keywords that seem questionable should be eliminated
and revisited once your campaign is up and running.

7.5.3
Keyword Match Types: What They Are All About
Keyword match types help to control which searches can trigger your ads. They can
widen the matching or make it quite narrow. There are four match types: Broad,
Broad Match Modiﬁed, Phrase, and Exact match. Match types are speciﬁed by
symbols. Multiple match types should be utilized for best performance. It is
important to test the match types against each other as different match types will
perform differently.
Exact Match
This match type will only trigger searches that are the speciﬁc keyword you’ve
speciﬁed or the plural of that keyword. Exact match is speciﬁed by the square
brackets, like this: [running shoes]. Exact match should always be utilized. Exact
match typically sees the strongest performance since this is the exact term you want
your ads to show on.
Phrase Match
This match type will trigger searches that include the phrase you’ve speciﬁed. This
match type is speciﬁed by quotation marks, like this: “running shoes”. Advertising
on running shoes on phrase match would mean ads would show on searches that
include the phrase “running shoes”. Running Shoes could be paired with a large
variety of modiﬁers. Phrase match allows advertisers to pull in terms that are highly
related to their services or products but that include other words that the advertiser
may not think to advertise on directly. Phrase match should also be utilized in all
campaigns.
Broad Match Broad match is a bit of a wild card. It can provide an avenue for
picking up trafﬁc for long tail keywords, but it can also pick up a lot of unqualiﬁed
trafﬁc. Broad match can be utilized, but it needs to be done so very carefully.
Google may portray broad match as still being very related synonyms, but some-
times the matching can be very broad and not that related at all. This match type has
more of an advantage for Google than it does advertisers. It allows them to increase
their revenue, but it wastes advertiser’s budget.
Broad Match Modiﬁed This is a newer match type that Google came up with in
the past few years to help advertisers to pick up long tail trafﬁc, but to keep searches
more relevant. Broad Match Modiﬁed works by putting a + mark in front of the
most important words in your keyword. For example: if you want to advertising on
women’s sweaters on sale, you’d could specify that women’s and sweaters the most
important words and Google would then match to searches that include those
words, but the order could be reversed and there can be different modiﬁers. It would
like such: +women’s +sweaters for sale.
Figure 7.4 is helpful chart that show examples of what kind of searches could be
triggered by keyword on all the different match types.
Best practices are to utilize Exact and Phrase match on all terms, and then Broad
Match Modiﬁed or Broad match on areas where you’d like to pull in a wider variety
218
N. Ciomek

of searches. Choosing match types correctly can help you to save budget and better
control where your ads show.
7.6
Keyword Organization
7.6.1
You’ve Got Your Keywords, Now What?
You’ve now got a list of clean keywords that are very relevant to your business.
Now comes in another organization step. How will you organize your keywords
within a campaign?
This will be done by ad groups. Ad groups are ways to sub-divide your key-
words within a campaign and pair those keywords with relevant ad copy.
Subdividing your keywords into groups allows for easier campaign management,
sending the keywords to the most relevant page on your website, and creating ad
copy that is highly relevant to those keywords.
7.6.2
Different Theories on How to Organize Your
Keywords
Talk to a dozen PPC professionals and you’ll get a dozen ways of how to organize
your keywords within a campaign. There is nearly an inﬁnite number of ways to
organize your keywords. Below are the 3 main ways PPC professionals will
organize ad groups:
1. One keyword, one match type per ad group. This is a pretty granular way to
organize your campaigns and only recommended when you have a lot high
volume keywords. This creates a lot of ad groups and can be time consuming to
Fig. 7.4 Keyword Match types
7
Internet Advertising and Google AdWords
219

manage and for ad copy testing. It allows for ads to really match that single
keyword quite well.
2. One keyword on all match types per ad group. This style isolates a single
keyword to each ad group, but includes all match types. This can allow you to
see which match types performs best with a great amount of ease, but there will
be a larger number of ad groups still.
3. Themed ad groups of tightly knit keywords. In this model ad groups would be
something like this: Best Running Shoes, Cheap Running Shoes, Black Running
Shoes, and so forth. Basically, you’ll have an ad group for each modiﬁer of the
main product or service. Each ad group will include any and all keywords with
that modiﬁer. This is a more manageable style as it makes a lower number of ad
groups, but still allows ads to be very tailored to keywords in the ad group. It
can make it more difﬁcult to understand which match type performs best.
7.6.3
How to Choose an Organizational Style
Deciding which organization style to select will really depend on each individual
account manager. In selecting an organization style consider the following:
1. How large is your budget and how much trafﬁc do you estimate your ads will
get? If it is quite high, the 1st or 2nd organizational styles may be best. If it is
lower, the 3rd may be right for you.
2. How much time do you have? The top 2 organizational styles are more time
consuming in some ways because there will be more ad groups to create ad copy
for. Consider how much time you have to spend on PPC management.
3. How many keywords do you have? If you have a lower number of keywords,
putting one keyword per ad group could be the best. But, if you have a high
number of keywords then you’d probably be better off with #2 or #3.
To most important factor of keyword organization is that it is logical and clean.
You can use one of the above styles or something entirely different. Make sure the
organization of the keyword makes sense and is done in a thoughtful manner.
Keywords related to each other should be in the same ad groups for the best ad copy
creation.
7.7
Negative Keywords
7.7.1
What is a Negative Keyword?
There are going to be keyword searches that you do not want your ads to show up
on. These searches may be slightly relevant to your business, but not the users you
220
N. Ciomek

want. Or the searches may be entirely irrelevant. To continue with the women’s
shoes example, you would not want to show up on men’s shoes if you only sell
women’s shoes.
But how do you control for this? Selecting the match types can help, but doesn’t
entirely eliminate your ads being shown on irrelevant searches.
The only way to ensure your ads do not show on irrelevant searches is by adding
negative keywords. Negative keywords are keywords you do not want your ads to
show up on. These terms can be very broad, like “men’s” or very speciﬁc like
“patent leather pumps”.
To succeed in AdWords, you must have negative keywords. Google is a
for-proﬁt business with shareholders. They are always going to be pushing the
boundaries of what searches they are matching your ads to as broader matching
increases their revenue. It is up to each advertiser to be diligent and maintain a
strong negative keyword list to cut out any of these searches.
7.7.2
How to Select Your Negative Keywords
Selecting negatives correctly is very important as you don’t want to cut out any
relevant trafﬁc, but you also don’t want to waste your marketing dollars.
Before starting a campaign, you should brainstorm a list of negative keywords
that you know 100 % are not related to your business. It is best to think of related
products or services and add a negative keyword for that. If you sell only clothes for
adult women, you’d want to add negative keywords like men and children. Coming
up with a good list of high level negatives before you even start a campaign can
help you get your campaigns to proﬁtability faster. Your ads will never even have
an opportunity to show on those terms.
The next avenue to ﬁnd negative keywords is after your campaigns are running.
Google provides you with the data on what users have searched for before they
Fig. 7.5 Search terms: how customers ﬁnd your ad
7
Internet Advertising and Google AdWords
221

click on your ads. This is extremely useful information as it allows you to ﬁnd
irrelevant terms and stop wasting money on them. Google unfortunately does not
tell you every single search that your ad has shown on, but there is enough
information to make some deﬁnite improvements to your campaigns (see Fig. 7.5).
It’s important to consider user intent before adding a negative keyword. Think
about what the user would be looking for when the search for a particular term. This
can really help you to narrow if that keyword is relevant to your business.
Like keywords, you can add negatives as broad, phrase, or exact match types.
This is another thing you’ll want to consider before adding a negative keyword.
There will be those high level negatives that you know you never want your ads to
show up on, and those can be added as broad negatives. But, there may be
something that’s closely related to your business that you’ll want to exclude. This is
where negative exact matches come in handy as when you add a negative exact
match you are telling Google that you do not want to show up on that exact search.
Think about what match type is correct. Search queries should be reviewed regu-
larly to cut out unqualiﬁed trafﬁc. You need to remember that Google is a for proﬁt
business with shareholders who want to see an increase in revenue. Google will be
liberal with their matching of keywords to searches at times. This because they need
to increase their revenue. It is up to each advertiser to do their due diligence and cut
out any unqualiﬁed searches Google shows their ads on.
7.8
Landing Pages: Clicking an Ad is just the Beginning
7.8.1
What is a Landing Page and Why They are One
of the Most Important Aspects of PPC
One of the most important aspects of a PPC campaign is the landing page. The
landing page is the page where your ad will send visitors. This page is the ﬁrst
impression visitors will get of your business. Having high quality, nice looking
landing pages is very important. The landing page will help the user to determine if
they want to stay on your website, or leave. The landing page can be a page on your
website that already exists, or a page that’s been created speciﬁcally for users from
your advertising campaigns to visit. Since you are paying to drive users to your
website, getting them to stay on your page and take an action is extremely important.
As mentioned earlier, the relevancy of your landing page is part of what Google
considers when they determine your quality score. This is another reason a landing
page is very important. Google scans landing pages to determine their relevancy to
the keywords and the ad copy. If Google thinks the page isn’t relevant, you’ll
potentially end up with a lower quality scores and paying more per click. Google
also wants a landing page to have plenty of information, multiple actions for a user
to take (such as availability of links to other pages on your website so users are not
forced to take just one action), and clear presentation of your products or services.
222
N. Ciomek

Google wants landing pages to be relevant and of a strong quality because they
want their users to have great experiences when they click on ads. They want their
users to ﬁnd what they are looking for. Ensuring this improves their platform. But,
it also beneﬁts the advertiser. By requiring advertisers to have good landing pages,
it improves an advertiser’s chance at better quality leads and more sales.
You can have a great AdWords campaign set up that is highly optimized and
sending high quality users to your website. But, if your landing page is of poor
quality, then the great advertising campaign’s impact is zero. You need to care
about your website and landing pages more than your campaign. The landing page
is where your business will succeed or fail.
7.8.2
What Makes a Great Landing Page and How to Select
the Landing Page for Your Campaign
There are several aspects of a great landing page that will give you the best chance
of turning clicks into customers.
1. Relevancy Relevancy is the number one issue when picking a landing page. You
want the page to contain relevant content to what the user searched for. If
someone is searching for women’s running shoes, you want to send them to the
page with women’s running shoes, not a page with all women’s shoes. Always
pick the most speciﬁc page you possibly can on your website. This will instantly
improve relevancy. Keep landing pages speciﬁc and with good quality infor-
mation on a landing page. This will keep users on your website longer and
increase the likelihood of a conversion occurring.
2. Make it easy for the user to take the desired action This goes hand in hand with
relevancy. The landing page needs to be relevant to the user so that they take the
desired action on the site. But, it also needs to be easy for them to do. Is the lead
form in on the landing page? Is it short and easy to complete? Is the “Add to
Cart” or “Buy Now” button clear and easy to see? Is it easy to complete a
purchase? These are important questions to ask when evaluating a landing page.
In almost all cases, the home page is not a good landing page. Even with lead
generation, this can deter users from taking the action you want. If they have to
navigate to ﬁnd the contact form, they may leave the site. You want to make it
easy for your potential customers to ﬁnd what they want and to take action.
3. Easy Navigation Most aspects of a landing page ﬂow into each other. You want
to make it easy for a user to take action, but you also want to make it easy for
them to navigate your site. Perhaps a user doesn’t ﬁnd exactly what they want
7
Internet Advertising and Google AdWords
223

on the landing page or they want to learn more about your business before they
purchase, make the navigation easy to ﬁnd the links to other pages on your site.
When ﬁrst creating a campaign, take the time to ﬁnd the landing pages that are
most relevant to each ad group. Consider what you’d want to see if you were
searching for that product or service. Review to make sure the desired action is
obvious and that it is easy for users to navigate your site. A great landing page will
improve the results of your advertising campaign and help you to get the most for
each marketing dollar.
7.9
Tracking Conversions
7.9.1
Why Conversion Tracking Matters
One of the major beneﬁts of online advertising over most other forms of advertising
is that you can truly understand what you are getting from your advertising dollars.
Internet advertising is very trackable. You can know how many users clicked on
your ads at what hour of the day, from what location and via what ad copy. But,
there is more. You can track whether a user who arrived via a paid ad purchased or
completed a lead.
This is invaluable information. To know that a certain keyword is creating a
good number of your sales, or that certain ad copy brings in the majority of leads is
invaluable.
To gain this valuable information, all that is required is a code being placed on
your website. Surprisingly, there are a good number of online advertisers who do
not utilize this option. To truly understanding your advertising program and to get
the most of your campaigns you MUST utilize this feature of AdWords. It will
change how you look at your advertising program forever. Being able to know
exactly how much you pay per lead or how many sales you get from an advertising
campaign each day will allow you to improve your advertising as well as allocate
your marketing budget properly.
7.9.2
What is Conversion Tracking?
Conversion tracking is the method by which you track sales or leads on your
website. Google makes this incredibly easy to set up. A unique code is generated
within the interface after selecting the “Conversions” options (see Fig. 7.6). You
then take this code and place it on the Thank You page on your website. This is the
page users see after they complete the lead form or make a purchase.
224
N. Ciomek

When a user enters your site from a paid ad, Google drops a cookie on their
browser. When a user completes the action you’ve determined to be your “con-
version”, the code on the Thank You page is triggered and it is reported back to
AdWords that this action has been taken. It can take up to 24 hours for conversions
to be reported to AdWords. You will then be able to see what keyword and ad copy
led to that conversion. Through other reports in AdWords you can also learn where
the user was located, what time the conversion occurred, and what device type they
used. This information will help you to make essential decisions in your AdWords
campaigns and can greatly improve your ROI.

Quality Scores: Google’s Invisible Hand Tilts
the Field
7.10.1
What Are Quality Scores?
A quality score is a variable that inﬂuences where ads rank and how much
advertisers pay per click. Google deﬁnes a quality score as the estimated quality of
your keywords, ads, and landing page. Google calculates a quality score for each
and every keyword. Quality scores can be 1–10. 1–3 are considered to be poor
quality scores; 4–6 are average quality scores; and 7–10 are good/great quality
scores.
The factors they use to calculate a quality score are expected click-through-rate,
landing page experience and ad relevance. The higher the relevance of your ads and

7
Internet Advertising and Google AdWords
225

landing pages to the keywords, the higher your quality scores will be.
7.10.2
Why They Matter and How They Impact Your
AdWords Campaigns
Quality scores matter because they determine how much you pay per click and how
high your ads rank. If you have a quality score of 10, your cost per click (CPC) will
be less and you can rank higher at a lower cost per click. If your quality score is 2, it
will cost you a lot more per click than an advertiser with a quality score of 10. Your
ads will also most likely be showing lower in the search results.
Having poor quality scores means you’ll pay more for each and every click. You
will have to pay more if you want your ads to show at the top of the page. This is
why how you organize your campaigns matter, why the landing page and ad copy
matter. This is Google’s way of ensuring relevancy from advertisers. It allows them
to algorithmically control the quality of the marketplace by punishing users who
226
N. Ciomek

they believe are advertising on keywords that are irrelevant to their website or who
are not giving users a quality experience.
Every account will have a few low quality score keywords. These are typically
the broader terms that may not be quite as relevant as the others in your account.
But if low quality scores begin to dominate an account it will drive up costs, your
ads will show less frequently and generally damage your PPC account performance.
7.11
Analysis and Optimization: Ongoing Effort
7.11.1
An Ongoing Effort
You’ve researched your keywords, organized them into ad groups, created ad copy
and picked great landing pages. Your conversion tracking is all set up. You’ve
turned your campaign live… Now what?
Now comes the time to analyze and optimize. Do not set it and forget it. This
will lead to wasted advertising dollars. Google has many automated features that
can help you to cut down your time spent optimizing your campaigns, but at the end
of the day a human is needed to review what search queries your ads are showing
on, create new ad copy and to truly understand performance.
Check in on your campaigns regularly, make changes every single week. Proper
maintenance will lead to on-going success in AdWords. Google provides a platform
that can put your ads in front of hundreds to thousands to hundreds of thousands of
users. They’ve created a user friendly interface, great tools and a simplistic way to
create an advertising campaign. All the necessities for success are in front of every
small business. Google AdWords makes it possible for small businesses to succeed
in an online marketplace. Everyone can compete equally and acquire new potential
customers. It is up to the business to make the most of that. Once you’ve got a
campaign running, take the time to pay attention to it. Regular review and opti-
mizations will lead to great degrees of success, more customers, and better return on
investment. It’s up to you to grab that opportunity and make it work for you.
7.11.2
Approaches for Account Maintenance
It’s 100 % necessary to maintain your AdWords account. The “Set it and Forget”
mentality does not work. Eventually, performance will fall off and your account
will suffer. Account maintenance is about patience and diligence. Campaigns, ad
groups, ads and keywords all collect data at their own rate, unique to each cir-
cumstance. Some will be higher volume; others will take longer.
You have to have and wait for the appropriate amount of data to collect to make
changes. It is imperative to wait until you have a statistically signiﬁcant amount of
7
Internet Advertising and Google AdWords
227

data to make changes. Optimizations have to be data driven. You need to make
decisions that are informed by real numbers. True AdWords success, especially in
competitive areas, comes from diligent ongoing account maintenance and informed
optimizations. This is really the only way to make AdWords work for you.
There are a large number of optimizations that can be made to improve your
account performance. Some changes need to be made weekly, bi-weekly, and
monthly or even longer, depending on what those changes are. Below guidelines for
making changes at the appropriate intervals. The frequency of changes can vary
based on the size of your AdWords account (accounts with high spend may need
changes to be made more frequently, accounts with only a couple hundred dollars in
spend will need changes even less frequently).
Weekly
• Optimize bids. You should review weekly and make any manual bid changes.
You should also utilize Google’s automated bid rules, which will change bids
automatically for you. This will help with optimization of the long tail. Bid rules
should be set up on cost per conversion goals. It is still important to review
keyword performance and bids weekly though as there may be keywords that
need adjustments outside of the bid rules.
• Review 7 day trends.
• Monitor budgets. Make sure your campaigns are not running out of budget too
quickly or spending more than desired.
• Review key performance indicators to make sure they are on target. Look at
CPCs, CTR, average ad position, conversion rate and trafﬁc levels to make sure
everything is in line with desired results. If not, dig into the account to ﬁnd low
performing areas.
Every other week
• Add negative keywords using last 14 days to 30 days of data.
• Review keyword level performance, pause poor performing keywords or adjust
bids. (Large accounts only.) A poor performing keyword is one that does not
meet your key performance indicators. This could be a high cost and no con-
versions. It could be a keyword with a very high cost per conversion. It could be
a keyword with high impressions and no clicks/very few clicks. These are all
types of poor performing keywords and what you should look for when you
evaluate performance.
Monthly
Review ad copy performance for past 30–60 days. Pause any poor performing
ads and then start new variations of top performing ads. You need at least 1,000
impressions to make a decision on an ad. You’ll want to pause any ads that do not
convert and have a high cost. You’ll also want to look at those with very low
click-through-rates and pause those if the other ad/ads in the ad group are per-
forming better.
228
N. Ciomek

• Review keyword and ad group performance by bounce rate and time on site.
Make bid adjustments or pause poor performers based on this data. Push key-
words with very long time on site.
• Add new keywords. Use search query data to ﬁnd new keywords, or use one of
the many available keyword tools. Add converting searches that are not already
in the account.
• Review long term keyword performance for larger accounts. Use last 3 months
of data. Make adjustments on any poor performers (reduce bids, pause poor
performers, look at search query information for those keywords).
• Review keyword performance by match type (larger accounts). Pause poor
performing match type variations and add other match types, if necessary.
• Review performance by device. Make adjustments to mobile bid as necessary. If
mobile has a high cost and no conversions, you may want to reduce the bid
further. If mobile is performing well, you’d want to increase the bid.
• Review quality scores. Monitor any keywords with low quality scores and look
at ways to make improvements. If a keyword has a low quality score and does
not perform well, then pause it.
• Review 30 day trends. Look for weak performing campaigns/ad groups/
keywords and make optimizations. Also, if a campaign/ad group/keyword is
performing very well, look at ways to get additional volume there.
• Review keyword level performance and pause poor performing keywords or
make adjustments to reduce spend and improve performance (small accounts).
Every 2 months
• Review long term keyword performance for small accounts. Look back up to
6 months. Pause any poor performing keywords.
• Review keyword performance by match type (small accounts). Pause poor
performing match type variations and add other match types, if necessary.
• Review sitelink extensions performance. Remove any poor performers. Test out
different sitelinks and/or new sitelinks text. Poor performers here would be
considered
any
sitelinks
that
have
a
low
conversion
rate
or
low
click-through-rate in comparison to the others.
• Review call out extensions performance. Remove any poor performers. Begin
new tests. Poor performers here would be considered any call out that has a low
conversion rate or low click-through-rate in comparison to the others.
• Review landing page performance. Test new pages as necessary. Here you’ll
want to look at conversion rate, time on site, and bounce rate to evaluate if a
landing page is a strong performer.
• Review keywords below ﬁrst page bid estimates and see if any bids should be
increased.
• Review keywords in low ad positions (6 or lower) and see if any bids should be
increased.
7
Internet Advertising and Google AdWords
229

Once a quarter
• Review hourly performance and adjust day parting as necessary. Look for the
best performing hours and potentially increase bids in those hours. Also con-
sider reducing bids in the low performing hours.
• Review all account settings and make any necessary changes.
• Complete a historical performance review. Look at the last 6 months or year to
date. Review all non-converting keywords in account for relevancy. Review all
non-converting ad copy and review for relevancy. Look at under performing
campaigns and ad groups. Put together plans for making improvements to
performance.
7.12
Beyond the Basics
You’ve now gotten a handle for what the core parts of an AdWords campaign are,
what you need to get started on AdWords and some ideas for optimizations. As you
become an increasingly advanced user of AdWords, there are some additional
features within the interface that you’ll deﬁnitely want to utilize. These features will
help to further improve the performance of your AdWords campaigns and help you
to better analyze your performance.
7.12.1
Ad Extensions
Ad extensions are exactly what their name implies: ways to extend your ads.
As ad revenue becomes increasingly important to Google, they’ve begun to
create ways for ads to take up more space in the Google search results. There are
several types of Google Ad extensions.
The ﬁrst is sitelinks. These are the blue links that will appear underneath of an ad
(see Fig. 7.7) These links are links to other pages on an advertiser’s web page. They
need to be different than the actual ad URLs. These links should be places you’d
like a user to potentially visit, but the click-through-rates on these links are typically
quite low. The main point of the links is that they take up additional space for your
ad. This is why they are very important to set up. With your ad taking up more
space, it will be very eye catching to a user.
Call Out Extensions are another way to take up some additional space with your
ad as well as tell users a bit more about what makes your business unique. Call out
extensions typically show right below the ad copy and above the sitelinks (see
Fig. 7.8). Google will display 2 or 3 at a time, but you can create up to 10, which
they will rotate. The text for each can be up to 25 characters.
230
N. Ciomek

You should use Call Out extensions to tell users more about your business –
what makes you different from your competitors, what some value adds are, and
other information that may convince users to do business with you.
Call Extensions add phone numbers next to your ad (see Fig. 7.9). These are
great for ads on mobile devices, as they allow users to click a call button and
immediately call your business. Phone numbers can display on desktop and tablets
as well, but obviously have a convenience factor on mobile phones.
Fig. 7.7 Ad extensions
Fig. 7.8 Ad extensions
Fig. 7.9 Adding phone numbers to your ads
7
Internet Advertising and Google AdWords
231

Locations extensions will show your address with your ad. (see Fig. 7.10). This
is great for businesses that want customers to come into their store or ofﬁce. It
makes it easy for a user to understand exactly where the business is located. It can
also encourage users to pick a local business over a nationwide company that does
not have a location in their town.
7.12.2
Dimensions Tab
The dimensions tab is last tab within the AdWords console and one that is often
underutilized (see Fig. 7.11). Within in this tab is a plethora of data broken down in
a variety of ways to help you best optimize your campaigns.
The reports you’ll ﬁnd here are under the drop down menu view (see Fig. 7.12).
You can look at a variety of information:
Conversions
If you’ve got multiple conversion types, you can see here how those different
conversions perform.
Labels
AdWords allows you to tag different campaigns, ad groups, keywords or ads with
labels. Some advertisers will utilize labels to group ad groups by product type (e.g.,
Fig. 7.10 Locations extensions
Fig. 7.11 Dimensions
232
N. Ciomek

shoes, pants, etc.). Here you can look at how each label is performing over the date
range you choose. This can be very helpful for quick analysis of a large product set.
Time
This can be broken down by hour of day, day, day of week, week, and month. This
is a great place to learn how your campaigns perform on an hourly and daily basis
and make optimizations based off of that.
Destination URL
This will give you a break down how each page you are sending users to performs.
It is an easy way to see landing page performance.
Top Movers
This report allows you to see which ad groups and campaigns have had the biggest
changes in clicks, impressions and so forth. It is useful for looking for any changes
in performance.
Geographic
This is a report that gives you information about performance of your account by
geographic location. It can tell you high level—like country or state performance.
But it can also break down the data as far as zip code and city. This can give you
some very useful information on what places perform best for you and give you
ideas on more advanced geographic targeting to test.
Fig. 7.12 Dimensions drop

233

User Locations
This is a variation on the Geographic. It utilizes user’s IP address information
instead of physical location. There isn’t really much variance on these reports.
Distance
Distance is a report that gives you insight into user’s locations from your address, if
you are using ad extensions. This can give an idea of how far users are willing to
travel to your business.
Search Terms
This is just another location to see search query data.
Paid and Organic Report
This table shows how your paid and organic results performed for every search that
triggered an ad or organic listing.
Free Clicks
This gives you information of any free clicks you have may received from Google
Shopping results.
Call Details
This gives you detailed information on any calls received from users who called in
from the Call Extensions. It will tell you users area code, length of call, and
date/time of call.
Campaign Details/Ad Group Details
Both of these reports give you a high level look at your campaigns and ad groups.
Here you can see if you have any disapproved ads, how many sitelinks are active, if
you’ve got ad scheduling set up and so forth.
7.12.3
Remarketing
Once many advertisers are established with a Google search campaign, they then
move onto Remarketing.
Remarketing is a way to advertise to users who already visited your site, but did
not convert. These users are then shown ads for your website around the web
through Google’s network. Google has an entire network of sites that are available
to display ads. Remarketing to users allows them to remind them of your services or
products, and hopefully bring them back to your website.
The way you advertise to these users is by putting another code on your website.
This code will drop a cookie into every user’s browser. This cookie will track what
pages a user on your website visits.
Once you’ve got this code on your website, you’ll then want to create your
remarketing lists (See Fig. 7.13) To create a remarketing list, you’ll go under your
Audiences tab.
234
N. Ciomek

There are many, many ways to retarget users. You can create a good variety of
lists. The best way to start though is to just a create one list for users who did not
complete the desired conversion.
Here you will create a list of users who visited a landing page, but did not visit
the Thank You URL.
The typical membership duration is 30 days. This means your ads will be shown
to users for 30 days after they initial visited your site.
Remarketing is a great way to try and recapture non-converting visitors, bring
them back to your site and turn them into customers. It’s also a great way to move
into more advanced AdWords advertising.
7.13
Business Marketing Plan
Google AdWords is becoming an increasingly important part of any businesses
marketing plan. It will only become more so in the future. As Google needs to
constantly increase their revenue to keep share holders happy, they will reduce the

importance of organic listings and focus more and more on their paid advertise-
ments. Consumers continue to turn online more and more frequently for their
shopping needs. This puts increasing importance on online advertising. There is a
very large audience to be found online, in particular on Google.
Online advertising allows advertisers to ﬁnd their target audience, and quickly
gain feedback on how their campaigns are performing. There is a wealth of data
available for advertisers to improve performance of their advertising campaigns as
well as better understand what users are interested in, how their users interact with
their website and what keywords and ads lead users to convert.
Google AdWords is the best avenue for online advertising currently available.
With thoughtfully planned campaigns and regular optimizations success can be
found in Google’s marketplace. The platform has its complexities and some
shortcomings, but by taking the time to understand how AdWords works and how
to best create and manage your campaigns, you’ve already taken a giant leap toward
ﬁnding online advertising success!

Chapter 8
Google Maps and Google Local Search
Nyagoslav Zhekov
8.1
A Brief History of Google Maps for Business
Google realized that location search, and mapping as an inseparable part of it, was
arguably the most important and useful feature a search engine should have. Many of
Google’s competitors were far ahead when “Search by Location” was launched as
part of Google Labs in September 2003. However, trying to produce accurate results
entirely based on scraped data proved to be not just difﬁcult, but in fact impossible.
Before the ofﬁcial launch of Google Local in March 2004, Google improved the
location data it had acquired via site indexing with additional structured data from
yellow pages sources. At that early stage of development, the main factors Google
used in their local search algorithm were “location”, “prominence” or “trust”, and
“relevance” (as part of Google’s general organic search algorithm). It was only in
February 2005, when Google Maps was ofﬁcially launched, that “distance” came in
the mix to bring the algorithm closer to its current form.
8.2
Google Local Business Center (LBC)
The biggest breakthrough in the area of serving business owners came when
Google Local Business Center (LBC) was ofﬁcially announced in March 2005.
The LBC had a great impact on all stakeholders:
(1) Businesses were able to get control of their business information and make
sure it was accurate;

237

(2) Customers had one more source of correct and reliable information for
products and services;
(3) Google beneﬁted by having their business database improved for free.
To get hold of their business listing, or to create it if it did not exist, business
owners or representatives needed to verify their ownership over a listing by
obtaining a PIN, which was mailed to the business’s address by Google.
The ﬁrst publicly released version of Google’s business dashboard was relatively
basic. It included only information editing options to update business name,
address, phone number, website, email, and a brief description. About 2 years later,
in March 2007, Google released a major update to the Local Business Center.
Businesses were able to add customized details, which could include anything from
information about services to areas served. One important addition was that the
veriﬁed business owner could “tell” Google about certain information that was
attributed to the business listing was incorrect. Why was this important? Since the
launch of the business dashboard, Google would add related information that it
found on the web and show it in the local search results together with the business
listing. Such information included images and map location. Frequently such data
was incorrect, and so it was essential for businesses to be able to edit or completely
remove those connections to their business record.
8.3
Google Street View
Google’s main goal since the launch of Google Maps (and Google Search) had
always been to collect the entire world’s data. Maps was the most ambitious of all
of the data collection projects, because what conglomeration of data could be bigger
than the world itself? Google realized that relying solely on online sources to map
the world was not enough. What was more, all the information Google obtained
online was very untrustworthy, because it might have been derived from ofﬂine
sources dating a few years back. As millions of buildings are erected worldwide
every year and others are demolished, new roads are built, and businesses move
their ofﬁces, data older than a few months could very easily be outdated. The only
logical solution was that data needed to be obtained “on the ground”. Thus, in May
2007, Google ofﬁcially announced one of its largest projects yet—Street View. At
that time they had 360° street imagery collected for only a handful of cities in the
United States (San Francisco, New York, Las Vegas, Miami, and Denver). It was
only in July 2008 that Street View was introduced outside the US—in selected
cities in France and Italy, followed by imagery from Australia and Japan. By June
2015, Street View covers the entire inhibited part of the United States, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand, Mexico, almost entire Europe (excluding only
Macedonia, Montenegro, and parts of Ukraine and Belarus), big parts of South
America, large parts of inhibited Russia, Southeast Asia, Japan and Korea, as well
as parts of India. The least covered continent remains Africa, with only South
238
N. Zhekov

Africa, Botswana, and Madagascar available, as well as small landmark parts of
Tanzania. Overall 88 countries and territories have complete or partial Street View
imagery by June 2015, with more than 10 additional countries to be added soon.
8.4
Google Maps
The next step for Google was to get the largest possible pool of contributors involved
in the process of mapping the world—the general users. In March 2008, Google
ofﬁcially opened its entire Maps database (available for US, Australia, and New
Zealand maps only at the time) for public edits. Google was arguably not well
prepared for the amount of updates they started receiving from users, and the data
veriﬁcation complications involved in making sure that the user feedback was
accurate. However, it is possible that they were forced to act fast, because since July
2007 reports of spam and abuse, mainly related to business listings, had been fre-
quent. Google lacked the capacity to effectively stop, or even slow, the spam wave,
and the easiest way to achieve at least partial victory was to get well-meaning users
to help. Unfortunately, later it seemed that the attempt backﬁred, because the early
adopters of the public edit functionality were the exact same spammers. They found
easily exploitable loopholes and literally ﬂooded Google Maps with fake business
listings. Because of the nature of Google Maps, such spam was useful predominantly
to service-based businesses, i.e. businesses which serve customers at the customers’
location, and frequently do not even have a public-facing location (for instance, they
operate from home). Locksmiths, towing service companies, garage door repair
contractors, carpet cleaners, and bail bonds were the main culprits. Prominent local
search blogger Mike Blumenthal notes in his February 2009 article that there were
“more locksmiths in NYC than cabs” if one was to trust Google Maps. In an attempt
to prove the ease with which the system could be abused, Blumenthal took control of
Microsoft’s Redmond, WA business listing and changed the location, the website
URL, and even the business name—to Microsoft Escort Service.
8.5
Google Map Maker
At that point it was evident that Google had to do something fast. Their response
came in June 2008 when Google Map Maker was launched. In essence, it was an
improved user-generated content (UGC) gathering and veriﬁcation system. Its main
purpose was to both make it easier for users to add or update mapping and business
data (including complicated geographic objects such as roads, rivers, and buildings),
and at the same time give more control to Google’s mapping data veriﬁcation team.
The effort was relatively successful as spam was at least partially contained, although
later on numerous withstanding loopholes were discovered. The main problem of
Map Maker was its great reliance on humans, and speciﬁcally on Google’s
8
Google Maps and Google Local Search
239

veriﬁcation team. Unfortunately, due to lack of focus on the problem, Google made
the mistake to outsource this crucial part of the process to an overseas team in India.
The overseas members were poorly trained by Google, and they lacked the important
insight of understanding the realities of life in different countries around the world
(one team was responsible for verifying UGC from all over the world). The problems
culminated in the temporary suspension of Map Maker in May 2015 after several
abuses had received worldwide media coverage. One of the most publicized pranks
was the inclusion of a business named “Edward’s Snow Den” at the address of The
White House. However, the one that prompted the quick suspension of Map Maker
was an image of the Android mascot seemingly urinating on the logo of Apple. The
image was mapped out using vegetation outlines addition on an empty piece of land
south of Islamabad, Pakistan.
8.6
Google Reviews and Google Places
While Google gradually ﬁgured out the best ways to obtain and verify mapping and
business data, the last piece of Google’s local search puzzle was the introduction of
an option for customers to provide their feedback on a company’s business listing.
In the early days of Google Local, Google would associate reviews (or content they
believed was reviews) they found on the web or provided directly by third-party
sources with the corresponding business listing. However, third-party data could
never be the most reliable and trustworthy source, and that is why in June 2007
Google announced the introduction of native Google reviews to Maps. For a variety
of reasons (probably due to Google’s apparent inability to comprehend “social”) the
task of getting enough high-quality business reviews proved to be beyond Google’s
capabilities. They realized that relatively fast, because by December 2009 they were
in advanced acquisition negotiations with review site Yelp. The speculated
$500-million deal fell through, however, which prompted Google to make signif-
icant effort in the area of reviews and ratings.
Google’s ﬁrst signiﬁcant effort in adding improvements to the “reviews
department” was an update to their sentiment analysis algorithm, which was
designed to analyze content around the web to see if it potentially included feed-
back sentiment on an “entity”. Google would then match the entity’s speculated
review (usually an excerpt from a block of text in a blog or news article) to a
business listing that they believed corresponded to that entity. Furthermore, in
August 2010, Google added the ability for business owners to be able to reply to
reviews, in an attempt to gain the support of business owners and to encourage
Google reviews. The arguably most successful effort was the launch of Hotpot in
November 2010. Hotpot was meant as a personalized recommendations booster.
The logic derived from the fact that if a friend of yours left a positive review for a
business, the chances that you would also like that business were much higher than
the chances that you would like another business for which a stranger left a similar
240
N. Zhekov

positive review. Later on, Hotpot was integrated into Google Places—the new name
of Google Local Business Center.
8.7
Google Products for Local Businesses
As discussed above, Google realized early on that there could be mutual beneﬁt if
they work together with business owners to improve business data in Google’s data
clusters. However, the road to creating a product that was useful and at the same
time user-friendly was not straightforward.
8.8
Google Business Dashboard with Google+
Google’s business dashboard went through three re-brandings and tens of updates
to ﬁnally be seen in the way it is today. The latest version of the dashboard is
integrated with Google+—Google’s social network (or “layer” as Googlers like to
call it). It is both the most sophisticated and the easiest to use version yet. Some of
the most important beneﬁts of the integration with Google+ are as follows:
(a) The ability for business owners to “socialize” with their customers.
Previously, business owners were able to share short, Twitter-like updates on
their business listings, but these lacked the exposure and the overall integration with
the public interface of the listings to be of any real use. Additionally, while pre-
viously introduced an option for users to “like” their favorite business listings, the
option was buried and thus very few people used it on a regular basis. The “like”
function and the “update sharing” function were not connected, i.e. if a business
shared an update on their business listing, a user that had liked the listing would not
be notiﬁed. This changed with the integration into Google+, and now users are able
to get notiﬁcations when a business posts something on their stream. Additional
social function was the introduction of Google Hangout—a way for businesses to
set up online video conferences with customers.
(b) Integration with Google Analytics.
Measuring results of online marketing efforts has always been one of the biggest
concerns for businesses of all sizes. Google’s old business dashboard provided very
basic details about impressions (how many times a business listing has shown in the
search results) and actions (how many people have clicked on the displayed result),
but even such basic feature frequently malfunctioned and were generally known to
provide inaccurate statistical data. Due to various technological constraints of the
way the old business dashboard had been set up, Google was unable to successfully
integrate it with Google Analytics—the specialized search and conversion data
8
Google Maps and Google Local Search
241

analysis tool by Google. This changed with the integration of Google+.
Additionally, Google improved the dashboard’s native statistical data display and
overall performance. The function is nowadays called “Insights” and it provides a
good amount of data, including driving direction requests, phone calls, social
engagement (for instance, how many people have +1’d or shared the posts of the
business), and audience segmentation.
(c) Increased trustworthiness of business data.
This is arguably the most important change that occurred. Previously, even
though a business might have claimed their online listing on Google, it was very
possible that the information displayed in the search results would differ from the
one the business owner or representative had provided via the dashboard. This was
caused by a discrepancy between the data which Google might have discovered or
received from third-party sources and the data provided by the veriﬁed owner or
representative (more on this later). After the integration with Google+ was com-
pleted, information provided by the veriﬁed business owner became the most
trustworthy source of data, and even if Google decides that different data should be
displayed publicly, they notify the owner, and allow them to re-update the infor-
mation if they want to.
Additional features were also added after the integration was completed, and at
the same time some features were dropped or updated (as mentioned above).
8.9
Google AdWords and AdWords Express
By now you might be wondering how Google monetized this whole endeavour, as
the investment of time and money into building the best possible location data was
extraordinary. The major means for Google to get revenue from all of their online
properties is ad placement. Their now highly sophisticated AdWords product is
their most important income source by far. In 2014 their revenue from advertising
was close to $60 billion, out of a total of $66 billion revenue for the year. In other
words, Google relies 90 % on its power as an advertising platform. The logic
behind the monetization of Google Maps is not different—more users and more
relevant results mean more clicks. This could only be achieved with the provision
of as much high-quality and in-depth information as possible. However, attracting
as many users as possible is only one side of the story. Google needed to have a
sophisticated, yet easy to use, advertising dashboard to entice business owners.
At ﬁrst, AdWords was not a perfect dashboard for business owners, because
location targeting was inaccurate or non-existent. In July 2009, Google launched a
“location extensions” function for AdWords—an integration with LBC. However,
it soon became evident that AdWords was too complicated for some business
owners and they were not able to get it to work successfully for their marketing
needs. That is why in October 2010 Google Boost was introduced (later re-branded
242
N. Zhekov

to AdWords Express). It was a very simpliﬁed solution tailored speciﬁcally to small
businesses that lacked the knowledge (and time) to be able to play around with the
multitude of functions that the regular AdWords dashboard offered. Nevertheless,
the main advantage of AdWords Express is not just about simplicity but also the
5-star (or fewer stars, depending on the ratings) review rating that shows up in the
advertisement. This has empirically been proven to be a great click-through rate
booster, which made the product relevant for businesses which had good Google
reviews. However, the cost per click for AdWords Express was much higher than a
well-tailored AdWords campaign with location extension. Eventually AdWords
Express was absorbed by AdWords, probably due to the fact that Google Places
(the name of Google’s business dashboard at the time) was moving to Google+. As
of June 2015 AdWords Express is still an available advertising option.
8.10
Google Tags
A short-lived product, launched in February 2010, was Google Tags. Although it
was discontinued in April 2011, Google Tags is worth mentioning because it was
one of the very few products outside the realm of AdWords, which Google laun-
ched for the immediate purpose of gaining additional revenue. The pricing structure
of Google Tags was rather unique—a ﬂat rate of US$25/month fee. Google Tags
offered the opportunity for business owners to add a small yellow-coloured tag
under their business listing with a featured message and link to a part of their
business listing. For example, if an advertising business was a restaurant, it might
be beneﬁcial for them to feature a link to their listing’s images in the search results,
so that customers could easily see the ambience and pictures of the cuisines on their
dining menu. Additionally, the tag would occupy real estate space in the imme-
diately visible part of the Google search result page, and it would attract attention,
because of its colour. Unfortunately, the main disadvantage of Tags, which prob-
ably led to their demise, was the fact that they were useful only if a business was
already ranked within the top local search results. If they were not, additional
visibility at a place where no one has any visibility (i.e. second page of Google’s
search results) would not be worth even the $25 Tags cost.
8.11
Google Business Views
Google Street View was able to display the exterior of a business, as well as the
surroundings. Google Maps would show the driving directions, and Google Places
would provide information about the business such as its phone number, working
hours, and services. However, Google realized that the piece of “data” it lacked was
an interactive imagery of the inside of a business. Business owners were able to
8
Google Maps and Google Local Search
243

post pictures on their listings, but those could feature anything from the face of the
owner to the logo of the company, and they would rarely give a clear idea about the
interior of the premises. In February 2010, the ﬁrst rumours of a new product called
Google Store Views appeared. In May 2011, the product was ofﬁcially launched
under the name Google Business Photos (later re-branded to Google Business
View). In the beginning, it consisted of a series of photos of the interior of a
business that were later uploaded by the Google certiﬁed photographer who took
the photos for the business listing. Later on, the product evolved into a 360°
imagery walk into the store, an exact copy of Street View. The trusted photographer
(or agency) would normally do the sales and actual implementation of the service,
and would share some of the proﬁts with Google. Thus, Google Business Views
does not cost Google anything. Today there are hundreds of trusted photographers
and agencies in 29 countries.
There are speculations that in future Google will be looking into using Google+
as a platform for increased ads exposure, or that they would experiment with
different, new types of advertising products, but as of June 2015 nothing concrete
has been announced.
8.12
Google Business Listings and Business Data
Up to now we discussed mainly the relationship among Google, its products’ users,
and business owners in providing and updating mapping and business information
on Google’s multitude of platforms. However, these are not the only sources of
information that Google has been using. In fact, the main layer of the basic data
comes from third-party sources. Google collects it in two main ways: by purchasing
it and by scraping it.
8.13
Business Data Aggregators
Google purchases licensed business data from the main business data providers in
each country they have ever introduced Google Places. In the United States, for
instance, the main business data aggregators (as they are better known) from which
Google has been getting data in exchange for payment are Infogroup, Acxiom, and
LocalEze (see “Appendix” at the end of the chapter for a list of major business data
providers for Google in selected countries). Each of these aggregators “aggregates”
business data from numerous other sources, such as government records, printed
yellow pages, and direct phone calls to businesses. Google pays for such data,
because it is generally more accurate and up-to-date than “scraping” local business
data.
244
N. Zhekov

8.14
Business Data Scraping
Scraping is the process in which Google’s crawler bots go through a website’s
content (which is mostly in structured form) and compile information that might be
useful for Google and could be re-used by them in different ways. If the scraped
information is structured, in other words, if the site provides additional encoded
details about what each bit of information represents, it is even easier for Google to
determine if and when such scraped data might be useful. That is why the majority of
the scraped data that Google uses for business listings are obtained by going through
the content of online business directories, Internet yellow pages (IYPs), and websites
whose main purpose is not to serve as business directories but to collect and display
information about a large quantity of businesses. The most famous (and most fre-
quently scraped) IYPs in the United States are Yellowpages.com, Superpages.com,
Citysearch.com, and Merchantcircle.com. Other sites that are not necessarily busi-
ness directories but are Google’s favourites are Yelp, Yahoo! Local, and Foursquare.
8.15
Business Listings
By obtaining information through direct purchases and through scraping, Google is
able to determine if a business actually does exist, as well as to cross-check and
verify the correct business name, address, and phone number. After Google’s
algorithm determines that a threshold of trustworthiness is reached, a Google
business listing is automatically generated. Such listings usually feature only very
basic information about the business—the mentioned name, address, and phone
number (abbreviated as NAP) as well as one business category. That is why most
businesses do not need to set up brand-new listings on Google, but to search for their
business record and claim it instead. However, it is possible that Google might have
determined that certain information is trustworthy enough and might have generated
a listing using that information, when in fact that information is outdated because the
business has closed down, moved, changed phone numbers, or rebranded. That is
when the real problem occurs, and that is why Google introduced very early on the
Local Business Center as mentioned above. The solution was not as sustainable as
Google would have wanted it to be however. Many owners did claim their business
listings and updated the information, but once they have closed doors or sold their
business, they did not update the information. That is why in the beginning of June
2015, Google introduced a simple system for business information to be kept as
up-to-date as possible. Now, in order for a business listing to stay owner-veriﬁed and
claimed, the business owner would need to log into the dashboard at least once every
6 months. Google would notify them via email 2 weeks prior to the “expiry date”. If
they fail to log into the account, their account will be disassociated with the business
listing, and the listing will be free for the public to edit, and previous information
provided by the business owner might get stripped down.

8.16
Business Rankings in Local Search Results
The additional nuance of Google using third-party business data is the fact that the
more of certain matching data Google ﬁnds, the more trustworthiness this data is in
Google’s weighed algorithm. Therefore, ceteris paribus, a higher number of
accurate mentions of a business’s information online would mean a higher ranking
in the local search results, because trustworthiness (or prominence) is one of the
three major local search ranking factors (relevance, prominence, and distance). The
term used within the local search community to refer to such kind of mentions is
“citations”. A citation could be any mention on any web document (a web page, for
instance) of a combination of at least two of the three main business attributes (i.e.
NAP: name, address, and phone number). In fact, citations are widely considered to
be one of the most important individual ranking factors. According to the most
authoritative survey on local search—the Local Search Ranking Factors, conducted
by David Mihm, “external location signals” (i.e. citations) carry 15.5 % of the total
weight in the organic local search rankings on Google.
8.17
Business Citations
There are two main sub-factors to citations—their “volume” and their “consistency”.
8.17.1
Citation Volume
The volume of citations for a business means exactly that—how many citations are
associated with a business. Citations, however, are not born equal and some are
more valuable than others. Citations could be divided into three groups based on the
type of website they are found on—generic citations, industry-speciﬁc citations,
and location-speciﬁc citations. Generic citations are found on sites where any kind
of business could be mentioned, such as the main business directories and data
aggregators, for instance. The industry-speciﬁc and location-speciﬁc citations are
found on sites where only businesses that comply with certain restrictions could be
mentioned. For instance, on the business directory website Justia.com only law
ﬁrms and lawyers could be listed. In terms of absolute value, generic citations are
the heavyweights. However, in terms of relative value as differentiators in the local
search rankings, the industry-speciﬁc and location-speciﬁc citations play a more
important role. Therefore, a business that wants to be ranked high in the relevant
local search results should optimally obtain a broad mix of citations from both
generic and speciﬁc citation sources.
246
N. Zhekov

8.17.2
Citation Consistency
Google is not the only player who collects business data from different third-party
sources. Almost every business directory does the same thing. They all face the
same problem as Google does—the business data they obtain is sometimes inac-
curate or outdated. As business records on such websites are used by Google as
citations, business owners need to make sure that their business data are accurate
not only on Google but also everywhere else on the web. The task is difﬁcult and in
many cases unachievable, because some sites do not provide an easy way for
business owners to claim the existing business listings and to update their business
details. The introduction of pay-to-play automated tools introduced since 2013 has
made the task even more difﬁcult. Companies providing such solutions get into
exclusive relationships with some of the business directories and offer them regular
payments in exchange for the access to business directories, allowing them to
update business data quickly. Such relationships make perfect sense to both the
solution providers and to the business directories. However, since their cost is
relatively high, they are generally unsustainable. As they require yearly fee pay-
ment, the ones who suffer are the business owners. Once the service is cancelled,
the results will oftentimes be reverted back to the state in which they were prior to
the service purchasing. The pay-to-play solutions have numerous imperfections in
the way they try to resolve the very complex business data issues, and therefore
they should not be viewed as a get-and-forget type of offerings.
8.18
Complexity of Online Business Data
The following example illustrates the complexity of the problem with online
business data:
LocalEze is one of the most important business data providers in the US. They
provide business information to a number of online platforms, one of which is
MerchantCircle.com. We do not know with 100 % accuracy how frequently
MerchantCircle receives or pulls data from Localeze’s database but for the pur-
poses of this example we will set the cycle at 45 days. Here is an example scenario:
On January 1, new business information from an ofﬁcial government source is
added to LocalEze’s database:
Business Name: Bob’s Painting
Business Address: 25 John’s Street, Miami, FL 33133
Business Phone: 305-555-1000
This
information
is
provided
for
use
by
the
“data
receivers”
and
MerchantCircle.com on February 15. However, in the meantime, on January 25,
the business owner (Bob) claims the listing on LocalEze and updates the
8
Google Maps and Google Local Search
247

information to feature his correct phone number. The LocalEze listing is updated
with the new phone number: 305-666-1555
Unfortunately, MerchantCircle.com does not understand (either due to the way the
new data is provided by LocalEze, or due to imperfections in their data clustering
system) that this new business phone, together with all the other unchanged
information, is for the exact same business. It is just that the phone number has
changed. Thus, on March 10, a new listing appears on MerchantCircle.com. Now
there are two listings for Bob’s business on their site:
Listing #1:
Business Name: Bob’s Painting
Business Address: 25 John’s Street, Miami, FL 33133
Business Phone: 305-555-1000
Listing #2:
Business Name: Bob’s Painting
Business Address: 25 John’s Street, Miami, FL 33133
Business Phone: 305-666-1555
Here’s a summary of the order of events:
January 1—The original listing is added to LocalEze.
January 25—The phone number on the original listing on LocalEze is edited.
February 15—The original listing ﬁnally enters the MerchantCircle database
(assuming it is a 45-day cycle).
March 10—The edited information enters the MerchantCircle database. However,
because MerchantCircle are not good at matching and de-duping info, they create a
separate listing (a duplicate) instead of editing the original listing from February 15.
Now Bob has a problem he does not even suspect he has.
From the above example, one could understand that the problem with online
business data does not end with just ﬁnding all the incorrect or outdated listings for
a business and updating them. A business owner needs to ﬁrst understand the
original source of the incorrect business data and start by ﬁxing the information at
the source. Once this is done, they can update the rest of the listings, as well as
removing any duplicate listings that might have been generated. The majority of the
automated pay-to-play solutions do not go through any of these two steps (ﬁnding
and editing the information at the source and removing duplicate listings).
8.19
Google Map Maker and Maps Spam
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, spam has been one of the most signiﬁcant
problems with Google Maps. First spam reports could be found as early as 2007,
and in 2015 the situation has improved only slightly. An issue connected with Maps
248
N. Zhekov

spam and probably the main catalyst for abuse is the fact that Google seem to be
unwilling to invest enough resources on creating stronger anti-spam system. This is
hardly a problem speciﬁc to Google Maps though. Google have always been trying
to resolve complex issues in programmable manner, most probably because of the
easier scalability of such solutions as compared to the use of human force. In the
early days of Google Maps and Google Places there was practically no way for
business owners or users to get in touch with a human being at Google, and the only
sporadic communication was automated responses to public edits (e.g. “your edit
has been approved”). In addition, there was no clear guidance available for business
owners or users on what to expect from Google. The abundance of technical
glitches on Google Maps made the situation nearly unbearable. In fact, it was so
horriﬁc by the end of 2012 when Google was in the process of transferring the
whole business dashboard from Google Places to Google+ that famous local search
blogger Mike Blumenthal wrote a now very revered article named “Google Local:
Train Wreck at the Junction”.
8.20
Out of Business?
Up until 2013, there were very few options for Google Maps users to contact
directly or indirectly a Google representative. The “Report a problem” feature had
been available since 2007, but it had never worked well enough to be a reliable
solution. At the same time, it has always taken Google a great deal of persuasion to
pay closer attention to particular issue. In fact, it has been proven numerous times
that they tend to react on non-prioritized matters only when the story gets picked up
by national and international media, and negative publicity looms over Googleplex.
A particularly damaging businesses exploit was brought to the attention of The New
York Times by Mike Blumenthal in 2011. The exploit stemmed from the fact that it
was relatively easy at the time to mark a business listing as closed (i.e. to report that
the company is out of business) and for such an edit to go live quickly. When a
business listing is marked as closed, it disappears from virtually any organic search
results, excluding (in some cases) exact-match brand name searches. This was the
silver bullet to killing competitors’ online presence for many unscrupulous busi-
nesses. The exploit had been around for a number of months and literally thousands
of businesses had complained via the only possible mean at the time—the Google
Places forum, but nothing was done on Google’s end to ﬁx it. However, after the
story was posted on the NYT on September 5, 2011, it took less than a day for
Google to respond publicly that they were taking action, and less than 10 days
(including non-working days) for them to resolve the issue.
8

8.21
Google Phone Support
As mentioned above, the only option for businesses to contact Google indirectly
was via the Google Places forum up until January 2013. In a big part due to the
signiﬁcant outrage that arose after the publication of the aforementioned article by
Mike Blumenthal (on November 29, 2012), Google introduced phone support for
the ﬁrst time in the existence of the local business center. The phone support began
on January 8, 2013—a little over one month after Blumenthal‘s article, even though
the issue had been around for more than 5 years.
8.22
Google Map Maker
In 2014 and 2015, a new wave of loopholes in the Google Maps data veriﬁcation
system was exposed. However, it was not until The White House and Apple’s logo
got involved that Google decided to unprecedentedly suspend user edits on Map
Maker (or at least their publishing) on May 12, 2015. How it all unveiled:
First, in early 2014 a Maps spammer, who had worked together with illegitimate
businesses in the past started publicizing Google Maps pranks he had created in
order to bring the issue to Google’s higher management, and to potentially prompt
them to prioritize the closing of the loopholes in the system. He was partially
successful, especially with a prank in which he managed to intercept calls to San
Francisco’s FBI ofﬁce, as well as Washington’s Secret Service ofﬁce. The publicity
was apparently not enough and in 2015 he retried by creating bogus business listing
with an address at The White House. The timing that time was “right”, because just
two weeks before that another story broke the news—of a prank in which Android’s
logo was mapped out in Northern Pakistan, urinating on an apple that looked very
much like Apple’s logo. It took just a few days for Google to make the decision to
completely suspend user edits on Map Maker. In August 2016, Google Map Maker
reopened in over 50 countries with two major changes: (1) Top mappers are
empowered to moderate user edits, and (2) polygon editing is no longer available.
In Google’s defense, some of the issues, which needed to be attended to, were
relatively complex and signiﬁcant amount of resources and time were needed for
them to be ﬁxed. For example, the Google LBC (later Google Places) dashboard
was built on a technologically outdated platform, and Google needed the time to
transfer the dashboard to the much more advanced Google+ platform. However, the
large majority of issues mentioned above required Google’s full attention for just a
few days to get resolved. Additionally, their main problem had always been the lack
of willingness to spend resources on high-quality customer service and ground-truth
data veriﬁcation teams. I have previously offered the following simple anti-spam
solutions and they are still valid nowadays.
250
N. Zhekov

8.23
Anti-spam Solutions
(1) Never offer phone veriﬁcation the ﬁrst time when a listing is claimed.
Instead, include stricter veriﬁcation requirements for listings created through
user-generated content (UGC). For instance, require at least one additional
hard-to-fake veriﬁable supporting evidence (registration with government institu-
tion that has public record with business information, local business chamber
registration, listing on Localeze (requires payment) or Acxiom (requires document
veriﬁcation), and document related to the business for which all the business
information is visible (similar to Acxiom’s veriﬁcation method)).
(2) Stricter checks on users who submit UGC through Map Maker and place
restrictions based on the number of edits or reviews on Map Maker.
A great example in this regard is Waze, which allows you to edit only certain
areas of the map (where you have passed through), and the areas expand based on
your activity on Waze. Some would argue that if stricter information veriﬁcation
rules are imposed, it would be the small business owners and not the spammers who
would suffer the most. However, I believe that while spammers are persistent and
unscrupulous, driven by potential high proﬁts, it is a big leap from creating fake
online business listings to providing counterfeit documentation for veriﬁcation
purposes. I believe that most of them would give up.
(3) Use postcards to verify ownership over a business listing.
Changing the phone number on an existing listing is relatively easy with some
persistence under the current state of the Map Maker system. Once the phone
number is changed to the one that the spammer has access to, they could easily take
control of the listing and potentially change all the information as they like. While
there are complicated schemes with rogue and fake addresses, a veriﬁcation post-
card makes it much more difﬁcult to change the address of a business listing as
compared to its phone number. Therefore, veriﬁcation by postcard as the only way
to verify one’s ownership over a business listing would provide a strong additional
protection.

Chapter 9
Subtle New Forms of Internet Inﬂuence
Are Putting Democracy at Risk
Worldwide
Robert Epstein
9.1
Democracy
The free and fair election is fundamental to democracy, but the internet has made
possible new, nearly invisible forms of inﬂuence that have likely been affecting the
outcomes of close elections worldwide for several years now. Left unchecked, these
forms of inﬂuence will inevitably grow over time, slowly but surely nullifying the
democratic process as we know it.
9.2
Digital Gerrymandering
One possible type of inﬂuence has been labeled “digital gerrymandering” by
Harvard law Professor Zittrain [4]. In conventional gerrymandering, the boundaries
of voting districts are altered to favor one political party, virtually guaranteeing that
the majority of voters in the newly-drawn districts will vote for that party. Zittrain
has pointed out that social media giants such as Facebook could easily accomplish
the same sort of manipulation by sending out multiple prompts to “go out and vote”
only to people who are known to favor one candidate or party. In close elections,
which are quite common, increasing the number of such people by even a small
amount could easily ﬂip an election.
Of greater concern, this kind of manipulation could be accomplished—or per-
haps is being accomplished—without anyone being the wiser. As it is, social media
companies already send out customized advertisements to more than a billion

people daily based on gender, age, location, purchase histories, and other factors.
They could easily send out—or perhaps are already sending out—prompts to vote
to select groups of people without anyone knowing that these groups are being
singled out.
9.3
Facebook Experiment
In a controlled study conducted in 2010, researchers at the University of California
San Diego, working with employees at Facebook, demonstrated that repeatedly
ﬂashing “VOTE” ads to over 60 million Facebook users on an election day in the
US caused 340,000 more people to vote than otherwise would have [1]—an
increase of approximately 0.57 %. The sample of people who received the vote
prompts was selected at random for the study, but, given Facebook’s massive
database of personal information about its users, the company could easily have
targeted people with known preferences for certain candidates or parties; hence, the
basis for Zittrain’s speculation. Shifting 0.57 % of voters toward one candidate
results in a marginal difference of 1.14 %—enough to ﬂip the outcomes of many
close elections (that is, elections with win margins under this percentage).
It is notable that the kinds of advertisements that could mobilize voters are
ephemeral in nature. They are ﬂashed brieﬂy to users and then disappear. Unlike the
main content of a website, which remains somewhat constant and might even be
preserved by tools like the Wayback Machine (see https://archive.org/web/),
advertisements don’t leave a paper trail. This gives companies such as Faceback
complete deniability if it was ever accused of interfering in an election.
Here is the kind of prompt Facebook sent its users in the 2010 experiment
254
R. Epstein

9.4
Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME)
Research I have been conducting with Ronald Robertson since early 2013 has
identiﬁed another problematic source of inﬂuence over voter preferences which we
call SEME (pronounced “seem”), for Search Engine Manipulation Effect. SEME,
we have concluded, is almost certainly already inﬂuencing close elections around
the world, and it is a much larger effect than digital gerrymandering; in fact, it is
proving to be one of the largest behavioral effects ever discovered.
Initially, in a series of ﬁve randomized, controlled experiments we completed
with 4556 participants in two countries, we demonstrated and repeatedly conﬁrmed
that when high ranking search results favor one candidate—that is, make him or her
look better than his or her opponent—the proportion of undecided voters supporting
that candidate can easily be increased by 20 % or more—up to 80 % in some
demographic groups [2]. Perhaps of greater concern, very few participants in our
experiments showed any awareness that they were viewing biased search results. In
other words, SEME is not only a large behavioral effect, it is also almost entirely
invisible.
What’s more, search results, like advertisements, are ephemeral. No records are
kept of them, which means that they leave no paper trail. Once again, this gives the
company displaying such results complete deniability.
High ranking search results alter opinions because most people mistakenly
believe that search rankings are determined by an objective, omniscient, and
infallible mechanism that is beyond human control. This is conﬁrmed by a variety
of research on consumer behavior which shows that people trust and believe
higher-ranked search results more than lower-ranked results. Over 50 % of all
clicks go to the top two search results, and more than 90 % of users never leave the
ﬁrst page of results. Research shows that this occurs even when high-ranking items
are of poor quality; it is not just for convenience sake that people click on
high-ranking items but rather because of those deeply-help beliefs regarding their
validity. Because of the enormous value that high-ranking items have for purchases,
North American companies are now spending more than 20 billion US dollars per
year on SEO in an attempt to push their links to higher positions.
When companies, candidates, or political parties compete in an open market-
place to get people’s attention, fairness is maintained—although, of course, the
players with more resources have always have the advantage. What happens,
however, when the search engine company itself has preferences?
This, of course, is the topic of investigations of Google, Inc. by the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission, the European Union, and the government of India, all of which
have found that Google unfairly favors its own products and services in its search
rankings. Given the power of SEME, one must also wonder: what impact might
Google have on elections if its search rankings also favored one candidate over
another?

9.5
2014 Lok Sabha Election
The ﬁfth experiment reported by Epstein and Robertson [2], conducted in India
during the 2014 Lok Sabha election—the largest democratic election in history—is
especially relevant to this question. Our previous experiments had focused on
elections that were already completed and on candidates who were unknown to the
participants in order to minimize any bias the participants might otherwise have
brought to the experiments—in other words, to guarantee that they were truly
“undecided” voters.
In the 2014 experiment, however, we used newspaper ads and online subject
pools to recruit 2,096 undecided voters in 27 of India’s 35 states and territories—
real voters in the midst of an intense, hotly-contested election campaign.
Participants were randomly assigned to groups in which search rankings favored
either Mr Modi (the ultimate winner), Mr Kejriwal, or Mr Gandhi. As we found in
our previous experiments, exposure to biased search rankings that linked to real
web pages (which participants could examine freely) caused voting preferences to
shift toward the targeted candidate by 20 % or more. In some demographic groups,
such as unemployed males from a certain region of India, the shift was over 70 %.
We got this result even though our participants were highly familiar with the
candidates.
That we conducted this research in India was especially appropriate given that in
March 2014, Google was ﬁned 10 million rupees (USD$164,000) by the
Competition Commission of India for “search engine bias.”

Are there any indications that actual Google search rankings might have favored
Mr Modi in the Lok Sabha election? Google’s own data—the daily “Google Score”
it assigned to the major political candidates based on search volumes—showed that
Modi outscored his opponents by at least 25 % for 60 consecutive days prior to the
day the polls closed on May 12th.
Because search volume is one predictor of search ranking, it is reasonable to
assume that Mr Modi was also favored in Google’s search rankings as more than
430 million votes were cast between April 7 and May 12. If even 10 % of India’s
voters with internet access were still undecided in the weeks before the polls closed,
biased rankings could have driven several million votes toward Mr Modi. What’s
more, with an increasingly large portion of the world’s population having internet
access, whatever the impact of biased search rankings is today, it will certainly be
much larger in the future. Our own data suggest that more than 85 % of people with
internet access are getting at least some of their election information from internet
sources—a number that is also likely to increase in coming years.

931746), and a study published in 2015 on Slate.com conﬁrms that Google search
rankings strongly favor Democratic candidates [3].
Couldn’t researchers or government agencies simply track and rate search
rankings to determine the extent to which they are biased toward one candidate or
another? This is not as easy a task as it sounds, and it might even be impossible.
Google’s revenue model depends on being able to identify users in real time so that
it can send them ads targeted to their particular needs; it provides free services so
that it can collect relevant information about every user. With the company able to
identify individuals and demographic groups with increasing reliability, it is also
able to send out customized search rankings to an increasingly large number of
users. From a regulatory standpoint, the problem here is that monitors would have
no way to look at the customized rankings Google is sending to particular indi-
viduals or demographic groups. Rankings that might appear clean on one computer
could be highly biased on another.
As I noted earlier, our research also demonstrates that the vast majority of voters
are unaware that the search rankings they are viewing are biased toward one can-
didate; more than 99 % of participants in our India study seemed oblivious.
Inﬂuence that is invisible to people is the most dangerous kind, because it leaves
people falsely believing that they are choosing freely—that they are not being
inﬂuenced at all.
Models we have developed suggest that opinion shifts of the magnitude we are
ﬁnding are large enough to ﬂip the outcomes of upwards of 25 % of the world’s
national elections. As of this writing, we have now replicated SEME nine times
with nearly 10,000 participants in multiple countries, and we also been examining
ways of suppressing the effect. Among other things, we have discovered that SEME
is probably having an enormous impact on a wide range of important decisions
people are making every day, not just on voting preferences.
9.7
Power of Google
SEME wouldn’t be much of a threat if the online search business were in the hands
of a dozen competing companies. Because more than 90 % of search in most
European countries and in many other countries around the world is in the hands of
a single company, however, no candidate or party has a way of offsetting the
inﬂuence that Google’s search rankings are likely having on elections.
One last point: Although it is reasonable to assume that Google executives are
using search rankings to favor candidates that they deem preferable for their
business needs (to do otherwise would be imprudent), our data suggest strongly that
Google’s search rankings are inﬂuencing elections even if Google’s executives are
keeping hands off. This is inevitable because of the fundamental nature of Google’s
ever-changing search algorithm. So-called “organic” search phenomena will
inevitably boost the rankings of some candidates over others; when this happens,
258
R. Epstein

the preferences of undecided voters will shift toward those candidates in a kind of
digital bandwagon effect.
Either way, to protect democracy, search rankings related to elections should be
strictly regulated.

Social Media as a Tool for Information
Warfare
Aylin Manduric
10.1
Social Media
The ability to quickly and cheaply share images and news across social media has
empowered the current generation to witness and participate in the development of
global tensions as they erupt into conﬂict. Over the past decade, social media has
shaken the monopoly the conventional news media once had on disseminating
knowledge about human rights abuses, civil wars, terrorist attacks, insurgen-
cies, and revolutions. With over 350 million (https://www.opendemocracy.net/
opensecurity/kym-beeston/'sharing'-witness-is-social-media-changing-way-we-see-
conﬂict) photographs uploaded daily to Facebook alone, social media has, and will
continue to revolutionize the way the world witnesses conﬂict. Like any tool, social
media can be used to further desirable outcomes like peace, or to facilitate illicit
operations that spread instability and promote violence. Using several recent
examples, the following section will illustrate some of the ways social media is
changing conﬂict.
Few conﬂicts are as fraught as that between the states of Israel and Palestine.
This conﬂict, which began before the advent of the internet, now has an enormous
presence on social media, with both Hamas and Israeli Defense Forces making use
of dramatic photography to garner support for their conﬂicting causes. The Israeli
Defense Forces Twitter page has over half a million followers (https://twitter.com/
IDFSpokesperson), and posts updates on the conﬂict as well as self-promoting
material every few hours. The State of Palestine’s Mission to the United Nations
has around 18 thousand followers (https://twitter.com/Palestine_UN), and also

makes several posts a day. The Hamas Movement’s English (https://twitter.com/
HamasInfoEn) Twitter account has nearly 25 thousand followers. These conﬂicting
parties dedicate signiﬁcant time to cultivating an online presence, which suggests
that they are aware of the potential beneﬁts to be derived from sharing their position
widely.
10.2
Information Warfare
On March 4, 2015, the Congressional Research Service released a collection of
insights on the role of social media in conﬂict. The short report was entitled
“Information
Warfare,”
(https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/IN10240.pdf)
and
described social media as “a weapon of words that inﬂuences the hearts and minds
of a target audience, and a weapon of mass destruction that can have effects on
targets in the physical world.” Aside from Twitter and Facebook, YouTube, blogs,
Instagram, and countless other social media applications can become tools for
conﬂict when they fall into the wrong hands. Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State
(IS) even have their own online magazines, which are available both online and in
print. Terrorist organizations make use of sleek videos, dramatic photography, and
well-formatted web pages to both appeal to potential recruits and donors and to
broadcast their capabilities and resources. A terror group with the resources to
construct and maintain an effective social media presence may also appear more
threatening to ordinary people who view or encounter the group online. Heavy use
of social media raises a group’s proﬁle globally, but by no means do terrorist groups
restrict their use of social media to marketing and recruitment. Al-Qaeda and IS
have both made extensive use of social media to identify targets, share training tools
and data, and disseminate information about their plans and “achievements.” All of
these functions lubricate the gears of an organization and facilitate operations.
Often, the marketing and recruitment uses of social media overlap with the target
identiﬁcation and data-sharing elements to catalyze new means of attack. In January
2015, after IS had been sharing their message through social media for some time,
the CyberCaliphate (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/
01/12/the-centcom-hack-that-wasnt/), a group of tech-savvy sympathizers hacked
the U.S. Central Command’s Twitter account, making the US Central Command
look vulnerable and even inept. After this case, Twitter responded by freezing
roughly 2000 accounts with links to IS, though the psychological impact of the
attack on those who witnessed or heard about it could not be reversed.
Of course, the use of social media is not restricted to terrorists or independent
individuals. Most national governments have an immense online presence, and
make extensive use of social media to spread messages both in support of their own
policies or to endorse actions and movements abroad. The Congressional Research
Service report on the role of social media in conﬂict highlights the tensions between
Ukraine and Russia as being illustrative of how government use of social media can
impact developing conﬂict between states. According to the report, spyware
262
A. Manduric

believed to have been of Russian origins was discovered on Ukrainian government
systems. The report’s author links this, as well as several cyberattacks on the
Ukrainian government networks, to patriotic hackers mobilized by the Russian
narrative of the conﬂict as it was spread on social media. Even so, the power of
social media to mobilize non-state actors to commit crimes on behalf of a state
remains dubious. More powerful is the impact of the threat of social media-related
attacks on state policies. Since 2012, Russia has had a law in place requiring
bloggers with more than 3,000 followers to register with the government. In
Ukraine, the 2014 cyberattacks were followed by the introduction of legislation
criminalizing open criticism of the government and placing restrictions on bloggers.
The fear that sparked these legislative changes may be linked to the association
of social media with the regime-ending revolutions that took place in the Middle
East and North Africa in 2011. The Egyptian Revolution, amongst others com-
prising the Arab Spring movement, is sometimes referred to (http://english.ahram.
org.eg/News/63253.aspx) alternately as a “Twitter Revolution” and a “Facebook
Revolution” because of the apparent role played by social media in the uprisings
that preceded the end of the reign of Hosni Mubarak. Though the signiﬁcance of the
role of the protests themselves in ending the regime remains in some circles (http://
english.ahram.org.eg/News/63253.aspx) a point of controversy, the vast social
media presence of the revolution is undeniable, with relevant Facebook pages and
Twitter accounts garnering immense popularity throughout the revolution. Social
media provided a forum for dissent, and a means by which likeminded people can
organize and express their desire for change. While these expressions do not in
themselves make change occur, they can nonetheless play a role in amplifying
existing sentiments within a community, and making those sentiments, and the
injustices that spurred them, known to everyone with an internet connection.
10.3
Arab Spring
As former CIA director James Woolsey indicated in an interview with CNN, it was
only during the Arab Spring (http://www.wired.com/2011/02/egypts-revolutionary-
ﬁre/) that state intelligence agencies began to realize the power of social media in
organizing and linking movements across countries and around the world.
Meanwhile, people like Google executive Wael Ghonim(http://www.wired.com/
2011/02/egypts-revolutionary-ﬁre/) have made this discovery through personal
experience. Ghonim (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/books/review/how-an-
egyptian-revolution-began-on-facebook.html?r=0) is the protester whose Facebook
page is said to have catalyzed the revolution by drawing attention to the death of a
young Egyptian man in a gruesome police beating. According to an article in the
New
York
Times
(http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/books/review/how-an-
egyptian-revolution-began-on-facebook.html?_r=0), 300 people joined Ghonim’s
Facebook group in the ﬁrst 2 min after he created it. The page had a following in
excess of a quarter million people within 3 months, and though the Egyptian

government responded to widespread protests in January of 2011 by shutting down
virtually all (http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jan/28/egypt-cuts-off-
internet-access) internet access across the country. After the fact, some commen-
tators have claimed that since the protests continued despite the shutdown, social
media played only a negligible role (http://www.thewire.com/global/2011/01/the-
twitter-revolution-debate-the-egyptian-test-case/21296/) in igniting the Egyptian
Revolution.
Yet, the Egyptian government saw the shutdown as a necessary measure to cope
with the threat posed by the protesters to its continued hold on the country. By
connecting people, and providing a window for the world to see the injustices that
triggered the protests, social media wore down the legitimacy of the previous
regime and conﬁrmed for each protester the idea that hundreds of thousands of
people, in Egypt and around the world, supported their revolution. The social
impact of this support is not small.
Nor can the role of social media in internationalizing the revolution be ignored.
After the Egyptian regime shut down internet access in response to the protests,
Andrew Noyes, a representative from Facebook, told the New York Times (http://
www.nytimes.com/2011/01/29/technology/internet/29cutoff.html)
that
“limiting
Internet access for millions of people is a matter of concern for the global com-
munity.” Though Egypt was not the ﬁrst state whose government interfered with its
citizens’ internet access, the extent of the cutoff was unprecedented and attracted
global condemnation. Activists from outside the country also mobilized to help
Egyptians circumvent the shutdown or communicate using alternative means.
Professor Ronald Deibert from the University of Toronto indicated publicly (http://
www.nytimes.com/2011/01/29/technology/internet/29cutoff.html) that the shut-
down could only cost the regime diplomatic leverage and political legitimacy.
Rather than stiﬂing the protests, the government’s choice to cut communications
amongst the protesters triggered an overwhelmingly negative international
response, granting the protesters increased leverage against the regime.
Social media plays a role in both active conﬂicts and burgeoning uprisings,
helping many notable occurrences receive international attention from vast numbers
of people who may have no direct stake in the outcome. This has myriad effects on
both the conﬂict itself and the people who are now capable of bearing witness to it.
Faced with a deluge of contradictory information, individuals may be inclined to
believe whatever aligns best with their existing normative assumptions. Some may
discover solidarity with the suffering of those far away, while others may ﬁnd that
their fear outweighs any newly awakened empathy. Across all of these examples,
what remains clear is that in the twenty-ﬁrst century, conﬂicts may play out within
the borders of a single state or region, but will do so with the participation or
observation of the whole world.

Part III
A Library to Last Forever
Because books are such an important part of the world’s collective knowledge and
cultural heritage, Larry Page, the co-founder of Google, ﬁrst proposed that we
digitize all books a decade ago, when we were a ﬂedgling startup. At the time, it
was viewed as so ambitious and challenging a project that we were unable to attract
anyone to work on it. But ﬁve years later, in 2004, Google Books (then called
Google Print) was born, allowing users to search hundreds of thousands of books.
Today, they number over 10 million and counting.
In the Insurance Year Book 1880–1881, which I found on Google Books,
Cornelius Walford chronicles the destruction of dozens of libraries and millions of
books, in the hope that such a record will “impress the necessity of something being
done” to preserve them. The famous library at Alexandria burned three times, in 48
B.C., A.D. 273 and A.D. 640, as did the Library of Congress, where a ﬁre in 1851
destroyed two-thirds of the collection.
I hope such destruction never happens again, but history would suggest
otherwise. More important, even if our cultural heritage stays intact in the world’s
foremost libraries, it is effectively lost if no one can access it easily. Many
companies, libraries and organizations will play a role in saving and making
available the works of the 20th century. Together, authors, publishers and Google
are taking just one step toward this goal, but it’s an important step. Let’s not miss
this opportunity.”

Chapter 11
Wolfram|Alpha: A Computational
Knowledge “Search” Engine
John B. Cassel
11.1
Introduction
Wolfram|Alpha (W|A) is a search engine in some senses, but not in others. People
do use W|A to search for responses to their questions. Additionally, W|A often runs
queries, or searches, through its databases. However, what W|A does not search for
information containing words that match or are similar to a provided phrase.
Instead, Wolfram|Alpha makes new contact with the history of librarianship, using
the curation work of library professionals and domain experts to map words into
functions describing the query, attempting to encode the question’s intent.
This chapter will ﬁrst describe how Wolfram|Alpha is different from other search
and answer technologies. Next, we will explain how Wolfram|Alpha took this
different path, one against the grain of technical trends but clearly sensible when
contextualized by the internal forces at play in the Wolfram group of companies.
Then we will examine a variety of Wolfram|Alpha queries, demonstrating what this
particular approach gives its users. From there, we will talk about the ongoing
legacy and the future directions for Wolfram|Alpha. Finally, we will conclude by
summing up how this particular technical organization serves people who need to
know not what is out there on the internet, but facts that can be readily calculated
and summarized when content is carefully distilled.

11.2
Against the Grain: Comparing
Wolfram|Alpha’s Technology
A key factor in the success of Wolfram|Alpha was not only the quality of its
technology, but that it went against the grain of the received wisdom of the time. W|
A was created in the height of the Web 2.0 boom when crowdsourcing and col-
lective intelligence were all the rage, but W|A worked by hiring in-house curators
who were librarians and domain experts to vet their data. In a time where statistical
machine-learning methods were dominating artiﬁcial-intelligence development,
novel syntactic approaches did Alpha’s heavy lifting. It was not information
retrieval technology that mined text of the Internet, but instead a symbolic approach
that found the computable meaning of queries. Instead of being a product of Silicon
Valley, it was a product of a low-key Midwestern town known for its high-tech
university and highly-ranked library school: Champaign, Illinois. By going against
the popular tide, Wolfram|Alpha had blank canvas for new technological innova-
tion. Let’s look into these differences by comparing Wolfram|Alpha with Google,
IBM’s Watson, and Wikipedia, and then talk a little about Wolfram|Alpha’s dis-
parities with contemporary artiﬁcial-intelligence trends.
11.3
Direct Differences: Wolfram|Alpha
in Comparison with Google
It is easiest to see Wolfram|Alpha’s difference by comparing it with Google as
Google was at the time. The most obvious difference is in the change of Google’s
results. Figure 11.1 displays sections of what the Wolfram|Alpha result for George
Washington looks like as of this writing.
As of this writing, if you search for “George Washington” on Google, you will
get the following summary on the right-hand side (see Fig. 11.2):
When Wolfram|Alpha came out, this was not a feature of Google, which had
links to other pages, not content in itself. Wolfram|Alpha rarely had links, and when
it did, they were not the primary content. Further, what links were displayed were
selected for inclusion by people. A better Wolfram|Alpha comparison in 2009 was
Wikipedia, with its summary boxes that organized its content into something more
uniform for each domain.
The striking thing about Wolfram|Alpha is that this kind of information is not
merely uniformly prepared canned content fed to a template. A result for, say,
“x3 −5x2 + 2y3 −7y”, which the author just made up and has no particular
268
J.B. Cassel

signiﬁcance, is just as meaty, including a 3D plot and a contour plot (see Fig. 11.3),
as well as alternate forms, roots, polynomial discriminant, integer roots, properties
as a function, roots for the y variable, derivative, indeﬁnite integral, local minimum,
local maximum, deﬁnite integral over a disk of radius R, and deﬁnite integral over a
square of edge length 2L, and it promises more if given more computation time
(a feature available to Wolfram|Alpha Pro users).
Fig. 11.1 Partial Wolfram|Alpha result for “George Washington”
11
Wolfram|Alpha: A Computational Knowledge “Search” Engine
269

Even this ability to create novel content doesn’t show Wolfram|Alpha in its
strongest light. Its most powerful feature is that it can link facts with computation,
to give a sense of proportion. Consider “unemployment rate New Mexico,
Nebraska”, a partial result of which is shown in Fig. 11.4. There are several striking
things about this. First, you are not easily going to get a direct comparison between
these two states elsewhere. The combination is novel, assembled to meet the query.
The next thing that the results not only include the rate, they also offer a calculation
of the change in rate over time. In an additional result segment that is not included
here, there are also some absolute counts of those employed and the rank of the
states in those counts. What this example shows is that novel queries to W|A that
combine different entities of the same kind and receive both customized and inte-
grated results, along with a further quantiﬁcation in rates and ranks that gives those
results context.
Wolfram|Alpha is also useful for discovering facts that are not explicitly present,
but available through formulas. Consider the result of “two drinks over an hour for
a 160 lb male”, as shown in Fig. 11.5. This result shows the blood alcohol content
as it relates to the legal driving limit of the United States.
Wolfram|Alpha is different from Google not only in what it does, but what it
does not do. If you ask Google “who is the best president of the United States”, it
will return documents with historical comparisons, polls, and opinions. However,
Fig. 11.1 (continued)
270
J.B. Cassel

Wolfram|Alpha does not index documents or generally deliver answers with
opinions or conjectures. You should expect from Wolfram|Alpha what you might
expect from a very adept computer program, and there is no agreed-upon com-
putational deﬁnition of what it means to be the best president. For this reason,
although Wolfram|Alpha may have to weigh in on disputed matters of fact such as
borders between countries or topics where the science has not yet been settled, it
does not participate in many controversies.

11

271

As Wolfram|Alpha and Google have complementary offerings, would Wolfram|
Alpha + Google be a better, more comprehensive search technology? It is a matter
of individual taste, but more is not necessarily better. Once one knows Wolfram|
Alpha is capable of answering a question in a particular domain, one can use it to
get the answer straightforwardly without sorting through other results. Similarly,
there is no point in using Wolfram|Alpha when searching for articles or opinions.
Overall, Wolfram|Alpha aims not to ﬁnd documents that contain facts, but to
combine facts in novel ways for comparison, or even assemble facts out of for-
mulae, while staying within the limits of what we might reasonably credit to
algorithms run over facts. Throughout this text, we’ll see further examples of
Wolfram|Alpha making calculations to achieve novel and salient results.

11.4
Internal Differences: Wolfram|Alpha in Comparison
with IBM’s Watson
We might be led by these differences from Google to say that, instead of being a
search engine, Wolfram|Alpha is a tool for question answering. This would be
entirely ﬁtting, as Wolfram|Alpha poses itself as a “computational answer engine”.
The appropriate comparison would then be with IBM’s Watson, the system known
Fig. 11.4 Partial Wolfram|Alpha result for “unemployment rate New Mexico, Nebraska”
11
Wolfram|Alpha: A Computational Knowledge “Search” Engine
273

for being the ﬁrst computer to win at Jeopardy. While those systems’ intended
applications are indeed closer, there are still critical differences in their internals.
The primary difference between the two is in information retrieval versus
symbolic processing. Watson uses information retrieval technology, processing
queries into searches over text indices and applying statistically trained result
selection. Wolfram|Alpha works rather differently. It is helpful to realize that
Wolfram|Alpha was developed by the same company that wrote the Wolfram
Language, a very large programming language. The initial phases of interpreting a
query do not involve going to particular indexes, but is effectively a compiler for a
very ambiguous programming language. The ambiguity between surviving parses is
then managed by a scoring system that internal curators have tuned to yield the
Fig. 11.5 W|A result for “two drinks over an hour for a 160 lb male” query
274
J.B. Cassel

most likely answer while also offering a mechanism for the user to select from other
valid interpretations of their question. These parses are then translated into a
symbolic representation, in a way made usable by the public in Mathematica 10.
For example, let us ask about the computable form of “creation date of Starry
Night”, which will be understood as pertaining to the painting by Vincent van
Gogh, with results shown in Fig. 11.6.
What’s happening is that this linkage to Wolfram|Alpha has converted the text to
a function. It is then the processing of that function, and processing that determines
information related to that function, that prepares the pages shown in Wolfram|
Alpha. Later, we will explain the reasons for this methodology choice, which comes
from both the technical history behind Alpha and how this allows integration into
yet broader systems.
11.5
Institutional Differences: Wolfram|Alpha
in Comparison with Wikipedia
As Wolfram|Alpha does not search external resources, which might have no clear
transformation into the symbolic relations described above, it works from an
internal compendium of databases and data feeds. In that way, Wolfram|Alpha is
like Wikipedia, where its knowledge resources are part of the overall system.
However, unlike Wikipedia, its content is not crowdsourced, save for some pro-
cessed feedback from users and from some volunteer programs, but instead comes
from a process of internal curation.
Wolfram|Alpha does not have open data as its implementation provides little
opportunity for the rewards of open authorship, namely community recognition.
Wolfram|Alpha’s data is not presented directly, but combined in multiple ways by
means of computational expression. Without a narrative or composition, the plea-
sure of having presented one’s composition is not as preserved. Further, certain
kinds of disputed data (such as contended borders between countries) need a pre-
sentation outside of a text which could nuance and qualify those disputes. Finally,
numerical data, being outside of a narrative, might be too easily altered by someone
with poor intentions. Overall, instead of attempting to build rewards into a

computational system that does little for authorship, Wolfram|Alpha maintains an
ethos of professionalism, the comradery of community, and an aesthetics for nuance
in curatorial practice from within the traditional bounds of the ﬁrm.
11.6
Wolfram|Alpha’s Relationship with Artiﬁcial
Intelligence
As we have discussed, Wolfram|Alpha’s contributions to artiﬁcial intelligence are
in a scalable infrastructure for syntactic question answering and the corresponding
demands in knowledge representation. However, Wolfram|Alpha’s differences from
common artiﬁcial intelligence practices, in particular its distance from the statistical
techniques dominant over the last 20 years, is perhaps more interesting.
Unquestionably, the task of answering queries posed in natural language is an
artiﬁcial intelligence project. The need of Wolfram|Alpha was very different than
posed in question answering tasks. Question answering is typically focused on
being able to answer inquiries about a particular text, having extracted relationships.
With Wolfram|Alpha, the kinds of domains and relationships that can be addressed
are planned ahead of time: can Wolfram|Alpha be sufﬁciently comprehensive in a
particular area? Does every kind of computation the W|A team chooses to make
available lead to a correct answer? Among the possible interpretations of a given
statement, are those that ﬁt with W|A’s potential answers plausible? The basic
guideline that W|A is engineered for is delivering high precision (a minimum of
false positives) at the cost of recall (a minimum of possible, but missed, answers).
This position means that nearly all potential translations to computational form
are as intended, and those that are not can be remediated through clear rules.
Scoring different outcomes is still necessary, but this is because some interpreta-
tions are more useful than others, even if all are semantically correct. For example,
the query “bra size chart” could validly mean one wants a graph of how the
population of the city of Bra in Italy changed over time. The city population area
interpretation is therefore allowed, but the garment interpretation is scored higher. If
interpretations are close in score, only one will be immediately displayed, but an
assumptions section will be displayed that allows the other interpretations to be
easily selected. Thus far it has simply been more efﬁcient to have scoring rules for
such cases than trying to introduce the ﬂoating point overhead of probability cal-
culations into the tight loops of the parse itself.
What the Wolfram|Alpha team has done is develop efﬁcient procedures by which
an organization of people can combinatorially assemble the kinds of relationships
that might be the output of natural language processing techniques, and represen-
tations appropriate to that assembly. How did the team come to this particular set of
technical choices? Let us now look into the forces that made Wolfram|Alpha.

11.7
How Wolfram|Alpha Could Happen:
A Social History
How could a technology so against the popular tide be developed? What we will see
is that Wolfram|Alpha directly addressed business needs while opening up a new
area of development. These business needs were able to be addressed by particular
organizational processes forming in the wake of a particular event, all harnessed
through existing precedents and control structures. These new processes, combined
with a palette of existing and new technological capabilities and focuses, led these
counter-trend technical directions to be the company’s dominant path. This devel-
opment was then sustained ﬁnancially with the aid of longtime strategic partners
whose needs the technology supported. This chapter will take you through how the
Wolfram|Alpha organization could and did make startlingly original choices.
11.8
The Business Context of Wolfram|Alpha
Wolfram|Alpha came along at a key time for what employees then called Wolfram
Research. At that point, the conglomerate was clearly one company and had long
sold one ﬂagship product, Mathematica, a comprehensive platform for technical
computing. Originating about 20 years before W|A, the product made a huge
splash, offering new heights in symbolic mathematics, function visualization, and
interactive technical document creation. In the next 20 years, growth in the com-
pany was synonymous with growth in this product, which holds a comfortable
niche with competitors Matlab and Maple. It was not cheap, but you got what you
payed for, backed by a dedicated group of mathematicians and computer scientists
bent on integrating as much technical computing as they could into a single uniﬁed
language and experience.
With such a mature product, one has to be very vigilant for competitors, partic-
ularly the ones that might initially be described as inferior. Clayton Christensen’s
popular theory of disruptive innovation [1, 2] posits that many products are under-
mined not by superior competitors, but inferior competitors that serve customers in a
different way. First, when an inferior competing product is launched, the company
with the superior one does not worry too much, as very few users of the new product
would buy the superior product anyway. Often, the inferior product has no real
competition in its submarket. Slowly, the inferior product improves, taking pro-
gressively larger shares of the overall market, but at no time does it make sense for the
superior product’s company to make a cheaper offering, as its own higher-margin
users would buy the lower margin product, eating away at that company’s own proﬁts
worse than by its competitors. Eventually, the competing product can become good
enough that whatever new need it was created to ﬁll (say a program to run on mobile
devices instead of desktop programs, or a disk drive smaller in physical size) will tip
the overall balance of features would tip to the competitor, leaving the once-superior
11
Wolfram|Alpha: A Computational Knowledge “Search” Engine
277

product’s company to be playing catch-up in a new technological substrate. Often,
there is little sign that such a disruption is taking place until it has occurred, making
the theory critical to recognizing potential trouble.
Mathematica was starting to show signs of being a candidate for disruption.
University students often preferred scientiﬁc calculators to software programs,
given their feasibility for individual classroom use and their not requiring any
additional hardware except batteries. The Internet and open-source licenses meant
that special-purpose university-written languages such as GAP were viable alter-
natives for mathematicians in particular ﬁelds. Perhaps most daunting of all,
open-source general-purpose languages, such as Python, with easily extended
library systems were starting to sprout numerical and symbolic computing exten-
sions, such as numPy, that were nowhere near as powerful as Mathematica but were
practical for some applications and continually gaining in capability. The capa-
bilities of Mathematica over-served the needs of these products’ users.
In the Wolfram group’s business landscape, Wolfram|Alpha functions as a
disruptor to potential disruptors. The Internet could now generally be assumed, and
smartphone technology was progressively widespread. A web page or download-
able app that did everything the calculator could, and more, meant upstaging the
calculator’s market. This sort of system also meant that instead of writing their own
software, people faced with complicated technical problems could enter them in
plain text and receive not only an answer, but all kinds of useful related informa-
tion, such as the steps by which such problems might be solved. Generally
speaking, the users who would have bought Mathematica to undertake these rela-
tively simple tasks would be few, but W|A represents direct competition for
Mathematica’s disruptors.
The icing on the cake was that Wolfram|Alpha would not only disrupt certain
kinds of competition, but could provide natural language technology for the
Wolfram Language, Mathematica, and other products. This would allow one to
write Wolfram Language programs that used natural language phrases rather than
code in sections. In other words, natural language technology would form a dif-
ferent basis for competition that no competitors would be prepared to follow,
allowing it to act as a disruptive presence in new areas.
11.9
An Organization that Made Wolfram|Alpha Possible
Any number of ﬁrms recognize that they have problems with disruption, but most
ﬁnd it nearly impossible to counter due to existing organizational commitments.
R&D staff are busy creating new incremental developments that retain and grow the
company’s largest-margin customers. Sales staff are more motivated to pursue sales
that have larger margins. How was Wolfram Research able to build Wolfram|Alpha
and become the Wolfram group after 20 years of pursuing a single platform?
The true secret behind the organizational capacity to create Wolfram|Alpha was
the book A New Kind of Science, and its accompanying research program, both
278
J.B. Cassel

known by the abbreviation NKS. The impact of NKS was not only, or even mainly,
its ideas but instead its human-resource effect on Wolfram Research. This work
attracted a great number of very bright people eager to build something completely
new and demonstrate the power of what they were working on. Though highly
praised and hugely inﬂuential on some, the book also received neutral and negative
reviews. With the book so new and not immediately adopted by skeptical and
already-preoccupied professors, young physicists wanting to get involved were not
immediately swallowed up by other research programs, but turned to Wolfram
Research itself. It was in NKS summer schools that many key developers for W|A
were discovered.
These individuals were often directed immediately into special projects or
ambiguous research positions instead of ﬁxed roles with binding job descriptions.
This ﬂuidity meant that a large part of the W|A work force was not in speciﬁc roles,
but was ready to be mobilized. Further, even for Mathematica, it was not
uncommon to organize the developing functionality of future releases through a
portfolio of projects allowing a robustness to one or the other not working out.
These ﬂexibilities were critical to providing the necessary staff.
With this new inﬂux and its corresponding projects, there was privately a fair
amount of concern from longer-term company developers about this new project,
with Mathematica-related work seeming the more stable option. However, if there
was any direct budgetary competition between the company’s initiatives, it was well
hidden. This centralization of ﬁscal discretion was critical for fostering Wolfram|
Alpha’s disruptive presence. An important part of that fostering was equal access to a
number of key services, including release engineering, systems administration,
accounting, human resources, and other corporate components that allowed the
internal start-up to begin with many institutional problems already solved.
It must be said that, even prior to the inﬂux of NKS-inﬂuenced physicists and
mathematicians, Wolfram Research staff had long had a variety of backgrounds
other than computer science. Of course, given Mathematica’s initial framing as a
tool for mathematics, mathematicians were strongly present. Physics, itself inten-
sively requiring technical computing, has also been well represented. The base of
Champaign, Illinois, home of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
(UIUC) is a highly-regarded engineering program drawing its student population
heavily from Chicago. As is inherent to businesses in college towns, it attracted a
variety of people who came to teach and study but then moved on to something else.
As an example of the limited way in which those with conventional backgrounds
played a role in W|A, a content director met a new developer in the hallway. He
asked him what he had studied in school. “Computer Science” was the reply. Hmm,
not physics, nuclear engineering, mathematics, or chemistry? How rare? Was he
perhaps one of the few hired to work with the data frameworks? And so he was.
As another example, a key Wolfram|Alpha engineer who had been a string
theorist was initially given the task of working on text-processing functions, known
as string manipulation. This might sound like a bad game of telephone gone wrong,
but it was entirely in tune with the organization’s strategy of turning smart people
loose on comparatively simple problems.
11
Wolfram|Alpha: A Computational Knowledge “Search” Engine
279

This wave of new researchers produced a tremendous amount of technology, but
it might never have been harnessed for the practical application of Wolfram|Alpha
if not for another aspect of Wolfram Research, namely its history of hiring li-
brarians. UIUC is not only highly ranked in engineering but is a top-ranking library
school. The company had long had a company library and actual librarians, who
would sometimes take on new roles. As the Alpha project progressively moved
from its early phases to needing a deﬁnite conclusion, the company turned to an
executive known for her ability to close difﬁcult projects, who had happened to be
the company’s ﬁrst librarian.
The gradual hiring of a department of library professionals and domain experts
marked the institutional gestation of Wolfram|Alpha. These “data curators” worked
in tandem with developers to shape and clean the data, and to give the phrases that
would designate that particular terms of a query should evaluate to a particular term
of a particular kind of function. Slowly, the group of developers improvising their
tools to get things done bifurcated into “content developers,” pursuing new domains
and “framework developers,” who added new development and curation tools, as
well as new runtime features.
The establishment of a data curation department was the ﬁrst step in Wolfram|
Alpha settling down into a more stable organization. Content managers specializing
in different kinds of knowledge brought a uniﬁed view to mathematical or
socio-economic topics. Standard review processes were set up, with upper man-
agement participating only at key points in the beginning and end of the process.
A systematic, frequent, and doggedly pursued release cycle provided an internal
clock that assured new features were carefully engineered to be integrated quickly
and that severe bugs were not allowed to linger. A team engaged with the feedback
of external users, making sure they received responses and closing the loop between
domain development and user needs. Log analysis provided another mode of user
feedback. The project was now being managed for incremental improvement, its
immediate disruption having been manifested.
This form of organization led to the conventional way that Wolfram|Alpha
works [3]. Whether through logs, feedback, commercial demand, internal use,
discovery of a convenient data source, or other means, a realm is identiﬁed as a
viable area for potential development. A developer is paired with a librarian, one of
them typically having strong knowledge of the domain. They are given relevant
query logs and, with the help of the content manager, imagine potential other
queries users might submit for the new content domain. Together, they research
myriad pertinent kinds of facts associated with the domain. Once those are decided
upon, the developer focuses on structuring the data, evaluating relevant expressions,
and presenting the results while the librarian vets facts and makes all viable
expressions of the domain ﬁnd the correct functions. If they come up against limits
or questions in expressing what is desired, they collaborate with framework
developers to engineer what is needed. Depending upon the domain and the nature
of available sources, the content developers and librarians can employ a great deal
of automation in preparing their work, developing more automation themselves
when appropriate. Therefore, advances in any technology that might help them,
280
J.B. Cassel

such as improvements in artiﬁcial intelligence, will either ﬁrst develop on a
domain-speciﬁc basis, become readily provided through existing frameworks, or
appear through changes in the Wolfram Language itself, and thus not seem dis-
ruptive but part of the regular workﬂow. The establishment of W|A’s organization is
not limited to development, but also to how domains are reviewed, how current
events from news or the internet (such as change in a country’s political leadership)
are quickly incorporated, how the site is monitored, how quality is assured, how
consulting projects are created, and any number of other matters that allow Alpha to
continue to run smoothly.
The combination of NKS-driven physicists and library professionals meant that
there was an absence of computer scientists or startup-interested business profes-
sionals, an unusual climate for a startup-like setting. This meant that Web 2.0’s
“architectures of participation” were not an ideological requirement. Instead, the
proclivities stereotypically associated with these disciplines, a personal control over
correctness and organization, were actually fully manifested by the team, institu-
tionalized rather than outsourced. This separation from technical trends also meant
that Alpha’s technology was path dependent upon then Wolfram Research’s
existing technology and its surrounding norms, which we will turn to now.
11.10
Forming the Technology that Forms Us
The dual origin of Wolfram|Alpha technology is clear: in “computable” data and in
projects to support ﬂexible calculators. By version 6, Mathematica had embedded
computable data for a variety of domains. What is meant by “computable data”?
Technical computing often needs access to mathematical and physical constants,
and basic socio-economic uses beneﬁt from having commonly used data and
statistics available. The question was how to take on those requirements with the
Wolfram Language’s “everything-included” maximalist philosophy. The answer
was to allow each domain of data correspond to its own function, each with a
common design to aid in documentation and overall usability. These functions
could be set up to yield different results at different times, and not evaluate if given
unbound variables, keeping the result of asking for data “symbolic”.
Even earlier, the need for ﬂexible calculators was becoming clear. How could
people calculate an integral without either using a typeset entry palette or remem-
bering the order of Integrate’s arguments? If users could get a text box that corre-
sponded to an integral, there would probably be a relatively ﬁxed number of ways they
might try to enter what they wanted to integrate, and those ways would be easy to pick
out. From there, the thought was maybe it would be easy enough to tell what some-
body typed in for an integral from what was typed in for a derivative, or other
mathematical functions. This thought extended “Integrate“ to “Calculate“,after which
project name changes would be more for external than internal communication.
The idea and then pursuit of being able to include computable data in free text
calculations is an example of scope creep elevated to a software-engineering
11
Wolfram|Alpha: A Computational Knowledge “Search” Engine
281

methodology. The conversion of “Integrate x2 from one to ﬁve” to Integrate[x2,
{x,1,5}] is perhaps harder than converting “population of france” into CountryData
[“France”,”Population”].
Though it may seem clear that Wolfram|Alpha is, from an implementation
perspective, a direct descendent of these computable-data and free-text-entry pro-
jects, why was computable data pursued in the ﬁrst place? Why should a symbolic
CountryData[country,”Population”] be considered valid source code? The ethic of
allowing everything to be symbolic stems from the Wolfram Language’s roots in
handling symbolic mathematics. Every result is subject to the simpliﬁcation of
term-rewriting and if not resolved is left unevaluated for future substitutions if at all
possible. The early Wolfram Language was actually a term-rewriting system, with
more traditional language constructs like lexical scope appearing later. As we’ll see
later, the idea of an entirely symbolic language has been taken yet further.
With mathematics and data in place, it became clear that Wolfram|Alpha would
need other capabilities, including data on formulas and how to compute them, along
with units such as length and time. An early uncanny result of Wolfram|Alpha’s
integration between data, units, and mathematics occurred when a software quality
engineer tried the query “cubic lightyear of jello” and it worked! (See Fig. 11.7).
How could this complex interaction between computable data and free text work,
given the variety of different processing needs for different kind of data? How was
Wolfram|Alpha able to take advantage of domain-expert developers without much
Fig. 11.7 Wolfram|Alpha “cubic lightyear of jello query rendered in Mathematica
282
J.B. Cassel

particular training in databases or information retrieval? The secret was to extend the
designed commonality across various data functions like CountryData and
ElementData all the all the way down into a database of common modular parts,
easily translated from Wolfram Language statements. Like tactics in a videogame
based on invading territory, W|A’s data infrastructure was built in simple units that
could be assembled in giant swarms to speed the initial rush of product release. It
was only after this technology was deployed that the team pursued more reﬁned
platforms with greater expressiveness but more specialized uses. To this day, the
simple, modular system survives, with its integration into standard toolkits and its
terminology forming the dominant metaphors for developers.
These structures also created a standard metaphor that colored the kind of
interaction the organization took on with unstructured data. Wolfram|Alpha didn’t
need to automatically understand messy data. The question for the team was always
this: Can we get the data into forms we want to work with relatively simple tools?
Dealing with unstructured data was a problem handled by strategic assessment
rather than raw processing ability.
11.11
Partnerships: “Help from Our Friends”
Though Wolfram|Alpha’s role in Wolfram’s competitive landscape was clear, what
wasn’t exactly clear was how it was going to make money. Of course, there was
advertising on the website itself. The company offers a paid Wolfram|Alpha Pro
version that can analyze the users’ own data, as well as calculate step-by-step
breakdowns of mathematics and chemistry problems, and process user images,
among other features continually being added. Another approach has been to create
appliances that allow users to query their own data with natural language, and
Wolfram|Alpha servers for institutions not wishing to enter their queries over the
public Internet. An API lets users to put W|A to their own uses. Widgets permit
content producers to embed purpose-speciﬁc information and visualization in their
contents.
All of these have contributed to Wolfram|Alpha, but partnerships have been the
dominant means of support. Unquestionably, the use of W|A within Siri has been
W|A’s broadest exposure. The relationship between Wolfram companies and Apple
goes back to Steve Jobs having suggested the name Mathematica. And in Wolfram|
Alpha’s early years, Microsoft played a crucial role in Wolfram|Alpha, at times
integrating W|A with Bing. Overall, these partnerships enabled Wolfram|Alpha
transitioning from an emerging to an established technology, through which we see
the cycle from strategic need and organizational mobilization to a mature platform
completed.
Now that we have seen the transition to a contemporary Wolfram|Alpha, let us
look into today’s W|A itself and see some of what it does and is for.
11

283

11.12
What Wolfram|Alpha Does, by Example
When should you use Wolfram|Alpha? One answer is when you don’t know if the
content is out there, and you need facts based on the content you have. Another is
when you have the facts, but need a summary. Yet another is to get a sense of
proportion or scale. W|A is also useful when you want a clean view of just the
information. It can also be fun to try the service just to see what it will do. Let us
illustrate these points by looking into a few of the many queries Wolfram|Alpha
could address. This is necessarily only a small sample; you might prefer to visit the
gallery of examples at http://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/.
11.13
Example: Food
Food is one area that combines facts with mathematics. Oftentimes, people want to
understand what they are eating without having to be too particular or do the math
themselves. If you just happen to want, say, a hamburger and fries at some random
cafeteria, W|A can create an approximate nutrition label (see Fig. 11.8).
People often want to go the other way, too, where they have some nutritional
goal and want to ﬁnd the foods that help get there. For instance, a person with an
iron deﬁciency might want to know which foods have the most iron (see Fig. 11.9).
That’s great, but what does this mean? We can also ask much iron a person
needs per day (see Fig. 11.10).
11.14
Example: Automobiles
Wolfram|Alpha can also offer capable summaries. Automobiles are a good example
for this. Let’s start with the most basic case, a single car, let’s say the “Ford C-Max
Hybrid”. Wolfram|Alpha provides an image and a summary (see Fig. 11.11) as well
as breakdowns for price, fuel efﬁciency, engine and transmission information,
interior and exterior dimensions and available colors, safety ratings, warranty
provisions, awards, features, available rebates, and Wikipedia hit history.
An overview of a particular car can be quite useful, but often we are interested in
comparing the merits of one car against another. Let’s compare “Ford C-Max
Hybrid versus Toyota Prius”, this time excerpting (Fig. 11.12) from down the page
where we can see price and fuel-efﬁciency comparisons. We can see that the C-Max
is modestly more affordable while the Prius has superior fuel economy.
In addition to model-by-model comparisons, we can compare automotive divi-
sions as a whole, such as “Ford versus Toyota”, to really get a sense of the
differences between the two brands. In addition to the body style, price, and
284
J.B. Cassel

fuel-economy comparisons shown in Fig. 11.13, W|A also compares the engine
volumes and physical dimensions of the companies’ vehicles.
11.15
Example: Sports and Games
A different area with a lot of possibilities for quantitative comparison is sports and
games. We might be interested in extreme events, such as “2014 MLB game with
most hits”, excerpted below (see Fig. 11.14).
Fig. 11.8 Partial Wolfram|Alpha result for “hamburger and fries”
11
Wolfram|Alpha: A Computational Knowledge “Search” Engine
285

We might also be interested in, say, understanding the total scale or variety in a
particular game. Consider “(Most powerful pokemon hit points)/(least powerful
pokemon hit points)”, which offers one window into how balanced the various

characters in the Pokémon game are. This result is very direct, with Fig. 11.15
showing the complete output for this query.
Wolfram|Alpha’s information on games is not just conﬁned to understanding
their attributes—it can occasionally offer some direct assistance. Consider how
“_al__la__” is interpreted as a request for those English words that can ﬁll the
implied blanks of the underscore, for help with crossword puzzles, hangman, and
the like. Figure 11.16 shows the complete result.
Fig. 11.11 Partial Wolfram|Alpha result for “Ford C-Max Hybrid”
11
Wolfram|Alpha: A Computational Knowledge “Search” Engine
287

11.16
Example: Places
In addition to offering quantitative comparisons between things and information on
events, Wolfram|Alpha also offers geographic, economic, social, and meteorolog-
ical insight into places (and not just on Earth). A friend of mine is now living in
Santa Rosa in California, so I decided to compare Santa Rosa with Champaign,
Illinois. “Champaign, Santa Rosa” returns some basic facts about the two cities,
including the segment shown in Fig. 11.17.

288
J.B. Cassel

You might suspect the cost of living would be sharply higher in Santa Rosa, and
“Champaign versus Santa Rosa cost of living” reveals that is true, as shown in
Fig. 11.18.
Among the facts returned by a “Champaign to Santa Rosa relocation” query, we
see (Fig. 11.19) the difference in some commonly incurred costs.
However, that same query also reveals that Champaign’s crime rates and sales
tax are higher (see Fig. 11.20).

Example: Relations
The kinds of practical relations that can be discovered computationally are not
restricted to numerical ones. Consider the result of “grandfather’s sister’s daugh-
ter”, which ﬁnds the name of the relation considered by this path (see Fig. 11.21).

11.18
Example: Humor
A completely different reason for using Wolfram|Alpha is for the fun of seeing how
it will respond. Any technology that answers general questions will be asked for
cultural references, such as “What is the answer to the question of life, the universe,
and everything?” or “What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?” Once
W|A successfully responds to such questions, there is naturally an interest to see
whether it will play along with requests to “Open the pod bay doors” and the like,
but perhaps also to see how it will answer personal questions. For the system to
play along with cultural references is shows that there are people willing to have fun
behind the curtain, and do so with a certain spirit. The query “tell me a joke”
usually returns a mathematical one, such as the one shown in Fig. 11.22. Notice the
parenthetical “my favorite sub-genre” that attributes a personality to W|A.
There are many more possibilities. The example page lists Mathematics, Words

we can only begin to sample in this chapter.
11.19
What Wolfram|Alpha Cannot yet Do
Yet despite all that might be within Wolfram|Alpha’s conventional ability to do, it
pragmatically does only what people frequently ask for, and might be expanded at
any time. “All former living Presidents of the United States” is a query that does not
work at the time of this writing, but W|A has all the development and data capa-
bilities to make it do so if it were sufﬁciently desired. “2 drinks in one hour for an
average US weight male” is another such query that Wolfram|Alpha could be made
Fig. 11.17 Partial Wolfram|Alpha result for “Champaign, Santa Rosa”
292
J.B. Cassel

to solve, though notice that the input has the subtle requirement to determine the
average weight excluding those below the legal US drinking age. The available
content is driven by user demand as well as the availability of the data. Automobile
data is a relatively recent addition, and no doubt if a sizable number of boat
enthusiasts tried to use Wolfram|Alpha to compare boats, such vehicles would also
be added.
Let us now talk about some functionality that is outside of Wolfram|Alpha’s
scope. The input length of queries to Alpha is deliberately limited. It does not
currently include the ability to enter text and answer semantic questions revealed
Fig. 11.18 W|A result for W|A “Champaign versus Santa Rosa cost of living”
11
Wolfram|Alpha: A Computational Knowledge “Search” Engine
293

from it. Nor does Alpha support ongoing interactivity, such as questions involving
pronouns or other indexical references to previous queries or responses.
Right now, Wolfram|Alpha does not automatically extract facts from unstruc-
tured data, such as documents. Even simple structures, like tables, present
imponderable difﬁculties. For one thing, documents can refer to any time, while
Wolfram|Alpha queries are evaluated at the present time. Consider a document
titled “Guest List” that has the entry “All of the living former Presidents of the
United States”. W|A might be able to determine the current list of people, but what
if this guest list is historical, or refers to a future event? It would not necessarily be
appropriate to resolve this entry’s phrase to a particular present-day list of people.
As another example, consider a table of material properties with an entry of “all
Fig. 11.19 Average retail prices from W|A “Champaign to Santa Rosa relocation” result
Fig. 11.20 Crime rate and sales tax information from W|A “Champaign to Santa Rosa relocation”

J.B. Cassel

plastics not otherwise mentioned”. What this phrase may refer to depends on a lot
of domain expertise likely not available to any general-purpose knowledge
extraction method.
As we will see later, the right way to tackle these issues might not always be
further development for Wolfram|Alpha, but further enhancing Wolfram|Alpha so it
can participate as a component in other projects.
In addition to what Wolfram|Alpha happens not to do and that which is extre-
mely difﬁcult for Wolfram|Alpha to ever do, there is what Wolfram|Alpha is not

allowed to do. One of the few cases in which Wolfram|Alpha has experienced a
decline in functionality is in generating personal reports from Facebook. Here is a
paragraph from a blog announcing this decline: “You’ll still be able to generate an
analysis of most of your own activity on Facebook, but you won’t have access to
any information about your friends (except their names) unless they’ve also
authorized our Facebook app. So in most cases, we won’t have enough data to
generate a meaningful friend network graph, or to compute statistics about location,
age, marital status, or other personal characteristics of your group of Facebook
friends.” Facebook serves as an example that Wolfram|Alpha can only undertake
domains that people allow to be gathered in a systematic way.
Now that we have looked at what Wolfram|Alpha does and does not do, let us
look to the new directions that Wolfram|Alpha has led to and in which it is serving
fascinating new roles.
11.20
The Ongoing Legacy
As we have seen, Wolfram|Alpha has changed the search-engine landscape, making
summaries and answers an increasingly important part of search results. Along with
its impact on the general public, the existence of Alpha has changed the direction of
the Wolfram group. This section looks at how W|A’s internal legacy is developing,
not resting on feedback driven incremental improvement alone, but also creating
new modes of interaction that challenge Alpha’s technical development in cate-
gorical ways.
11.21
New Initiatives
Overall, W|A Pro led to an experience of ﬁnding a new market for Wolfram
Language services, which has led to Wolfram building new cloud, web, and mobile
offerings aimed at different software needs with different means of collecting rev-
enue. The idea of developers not wanting to the hosting responsibilities of
webMathematica to deliver their applications has led to the Wolfram Programming
Cloud, offering not just “pay for full-functioning desktop use” but also “pay as you
go for application resource usage”. The Wolfram Data Science Platform will be
aimed at supporting data analysis workﬂows. Many other such products are in the
pipeline, each aimed at serving a distinct customer proﬁle.
The experience of ﬁnding a new market has led to other changes. Wolfram|
Alpha, Wolfram Finance Platform, and Wolfram SystemModeler have brought new
customer bases which give the company a new chance to tell its story. These new
audiences have led to Mathematica’s built-in language, itself initially called
Mathematica, being revised and rebranded as the Wolfram Language.
296

11.22
A Language with Reference to the World
However, the most dramatic change to the Wolfram Language as a result of
Wolfram|Alpha happened around Mathematica 10: the idea of embedding named
references to entities in the world in a programming language. Consider the ability
in Mathematica to ask for the Wolfram Language expression that returns entities for
all the planets, as shown in Fig. 11.23.
What this means is that the representation of a planet is a ﬁrst-class citizen of the
language, in the same degree as 1/5 being represented by Rational[1,5]. For a
language audited carefully for conceptual consistency, what this amounts to is a
Kripke-esce declaration of the necessity of names that puts Saturn (or France, or
any number of other entities) on par with True and 5. From a practical perspective,
this expansion means that users can do analysis across a domain, for example not
just obtaining the release date and box ofﬁce for a particular movie, but for all
movies. These new requirements require new modes of representation and new
infrastructure to support them, modes that cannot help but be suggestive of new
Alpha functionality.
11.23
Finding the Semantic Meaning of Unstructured
Data
Now that the Wolfram Language has semantic elements in direct reference to things
in the world, it has a working metaphor for dealing with unstructured data. New
Wolfram Language functions such as SemanticInterpretation, Interpreter, and
SemanticImport all work within different internal constraints and usage scenarios
for a common end: to produce these semantic annotations in an appropriately
relational form, such as the new Dataset, from user data. Of course, users will want
more than what Alpha has curated, and can provide their own symbolic item tokens
as desired. This may be the future of Wolfram|Alpha development: to exploit the
same means of markup available to particular markets of users.
Perhaps the most impressive extension of Wolfram|Alpha’s technologies thus far
to assist other projects in interpreting unstructured data has been addition of con-
ceptual entities for the Wolfram Image Identiﬁcation Project. For example, consider
the task shown in Fig. 11.24 of identifying a picture of a sundae. W|A already had
to know about sundaes for the purpose of giving nutritional information, but now its
Fig. 11.23 Mathematica 10 listing of planet entities
11
Wolfram|Alpha: A Computational Knowledge “Search” Engine
297

internal representation has been expanded to represent the “sundae” apart from its
contexts as a food with nutritional content and as a word with a deﬁnition. This new
computability is having explicit entities not only for proper things in the world, as
demonstrated above, but for generic things. What we have seen by now is that this
is but one more step in a long project of systematizing symbolic analogs to
real-world phenomena in a continued fusion of librarianship with computation.
With this view into Wolfram|Alpha’s continuing future, let us now sum up what
we have covered in this chapter.
11.24
Summing up
We have now seen how Wolfram|Alpha is different from other search and answer
technologies: it does not search through documents, but instead attempting to make
ordered presentation of facts related to the function the query best seems to rep-
resent. These facts are organized by professionals in an attempt to attain similar
saliency to that of a knowledgeable librarian. These differences aligned with a
developing need in the Wolfram group’s business strategy and were initially fos-
tered by the combination of newly minted NKS-inspired employees and a tradition
of librarianship, directed by existing technical choices, and supported by
long-standing professional relationships. The queries in Wolfram|Alpha give factual
answers to free text questions, providing context, proportion, and scale through
comparisons and extremes, while still allowing for a sense of fun. The work of
Wolfram|Alpha is not over, but is being extended to provide symbolic links to the
world in tandem with new ventures.
In conclusion, Wolfram|Alpha is a people-in-the-loop organizational technology
for the symbolic computation of worldly facts, developing both incrementally from

the in-product demands as manifested through logs and sharply through the
demands for new kinds of applications, aimed at providing speciﬁc answers to
queries across a wide range of curatable domains. Hopefully you now have an
understanding Wolfram|Alpha’s niche in search and answer technologies and of its
developing role in an ever-broadening range of approaches for bringing symbolic
computation into the world.

Toward Seamless Access: Libraries
from Alexandria Through the Digital Age
Barret Havens and Jennifer Rosenfeld
12.1
Historical Roots of Library Access
The advent of the internet has revolutionized the ways in which libraries serve their
users by facilitating the expansion of collections and enhancing access to those
collections. However, though the internet has had an unprecedented and profound
impact on libraries, other innovations, also ground-breaking in their respective
times, have set the stage for the development of the modern library by facilitating
access to information. Among these developments are the invention of the
Gutenberg printing press, the collocation of library materials by subject, and the use
of assignment indexing.
12.2
Impact of the Gutenberg Printing Press
Since their inception 4500 years ago, libraries have strived to fulﬁll two functions
that appear, on the surface, to be contradictory. On the one hand, they have sought
to serve users by making information in its many forms as accessible as possible.
On the other, they have needed, at times, to restrict access to information in order to
preserve and protect it for future users and future generations. However, throughout
history there has been an undeniable trend toward increasing user access to infor-
mation as it has become easier to record or publish, and less expensive to acquire.
From ancient through Medieval times, publishing was incredibly meticulous
work. In most parts of the world, information were recorded painstakingly by hand
using media such as stone, clay tablets, papyrus, and animal skin. As one might
imagine, texts produced by such arduous methods, many of them existing in very

limited quantity or even as one-of-a-kind specimens, were often treated as precious
objects [1]. Accordingly, evidence points to the fact that some early libraries were
Draconian in their role as guardians of their collections. Some of the earliest and
most severe library rules, in the form of entreaties to the gods to punish irre-
sponsible borrowers or thieves were inscribed on some of the clay tablets (see
Fig. 12.1) kept in early Mesopotamian archive-libraries: “Whoever removes [the
tablet]…may Ashur and Ninlil, angered and grim, cast him down, erase his name,
his seed, in the land” [2]. “He who enstrusts it to [other’s] hands, may all the gods
who are found in Babylon curse him!” [1]. Books in some medieval libraries were
chained to furniture to prevent theft, but were cut from their bindings occasionally
by persistent thieves [1].
Though there is little evidence to suggest that the borrowing of materials from
ancient or Medieval libraries was permitted frequently, an inscription found in an
ancient Athenian library states that the “directors had decided to eliminate bor-
rowing,” suggesting that it was allowed for a time [2] (Casson 107). Access to the
collections of early libraries was typically limited to nobility, clergy, and scholars,

civilization of Ninevah [3]

though once again, history provides exceptions such as the Roman bath libraries of
Nero’s era, which were open to all Romans, regardless of class, gender, or age [2].
Progressive printing techniques were introduced early in the Far East. Paper was
in use as early as the Western Han dynasty (221–224 B.C.E.) and multiple copies
of texts were printed using hand-carved wooden blocks, the earliest example of
which dates back to 8th century Korea [4]. The Chinese had even experimented
with movable type by the mid 11th century. However, movable type was hardly the
game-changing breakthrough in China that it would be in Europe 400 years later,
considering the expense and effort involved with producing stamps, or “types” for
each of the thousands of characters of the Chinese language that might constitute a
literary work [4].
According to library studies scholar Leila Avrin, “no historian believes seriously
that Chinese printing directly inspired the European invention” [4]. However, paper
did spread from China to Europe, albeit slowly, by way of Korea and Japan.
According to an Arabic text dated 1482, paper was being made in the Islamic
empire by the early eighth century [4]. It would take the next 600 years for
papermaking as a technology to spread from Muslim Spain to Christians in Spain
and then to much of the rest of Europe [4].
Papermaking reached Mainz, Germany in the 1320s [4]. In that same city, in
approximately 1450, Johannes Gutenberg introduced a wooden hand-press that
employed metal movable type, which was a more feasible prospect in Europe than
in Asia given the relatively limited quantity of letters in the alphabets of Romance
and Germanic languages. The effects of the Gutenberg press and successive ver-
sions of it on the availability of books were profound. In Europe before 1500, at
most, a book might be available in one hundred copies and read by thousands of
people [5]. After 1500, however, thousands of copies of a book could be available
and could be read by hundreds of thousands of people [5]. The growth of European
libraries during this period was enormous compared to the holdings of libraries
during the Medieval period, partially as a result of the increased availability of
books and the relative drop in their cost attributed to the Gutenberg press and
successive versions of the device [5].
The holdings of college libraries in some cases expanded from under 1000 items
to hundreds of thousands of items [1]. The availability of printed material, in turn,
increased literacy rates and drove up the demand for books, which fueled the
growth of the book trade [5]. Thus, the expansion of libraries was a direct result of
the increase of supply and demand [1].
Books, though rare by today’s standards, were no longer considered priceless.
Consequently, libraries relaxed in terms of their role as guardians of information,
expanding services to wider populations and allowing users greater access to
materials. For example, Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin, who served as chief
French ministers, collected so many books that they hired a full-time librarian to
organize the collection, which was open to “everybody” in 1661 and considered by
many to be the “best library of the time” [1]. By the late 1600s, thirty-two Parisian
libraries and 3 national ‘public’ libraries were accessible to general readers [1].
(However, French public libraries catered more to scholars than the public in terms
12
Toward Seamless Access: Libraries from Alexandria Through the Digital Age
303

of their collections until the early 1900s [1].) Around the same time in Britain,
parish churches made small libraries available to the public [5].
The demand for a wide variety of reading material, including popular items such
as novels, was high enough by the late 1700s to mid-1800s that people who lacked
access to libraries were willing to pay for it. During this time in America and parts
of Europe, subscription or dues-based access to collections at “social libraries” and
commercial book rental services known as “circulating libraries” gained popularity
[1]. However, by the mid-1800s public libraries had begun to expand and
proliferate.
The ﬁrst American free public library funded by taxes opened in Peterborough,
New Hampshire in 1833 [1]. In Britain from 1847 to 1850, however, the history of
the modern public library began in earnest when Parliament passed a series of acts
that led to the establishment of tax-supported public libraries throughout the
country. As a direct result, by 1900, 300 public libraries had been established [5].
Public libraries made signiﬁcant strides in America, France, Germany and Japan in
the mid to late 1800s, some enabled through legislation and others through chari-
table organizations such as the Franklin Society, as was the case in France [1].
However, the cause of library access received its most signiﬁcant boost in the form
of $56 million in funding by steel baron Andrew Carnegie, a Scottish immigrant
who had made his fortune in the United States. In English-speaking countries
throughout the world during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, more than 2509
libraries, many of them public (see Fig. 12.2), were established through Carnegie’s
philanthropy [6]. The chain-reaction started by Gutenberg’s invention had rippled
far and wide; libraries, and print-based information, were ﬁnally available to the
masses.

12.3
Collocation and Assignment Indexing
Another major breakthrough in terms of user access to library materials has come in
the form of two organizational innovations which go hand-in-hand: collocation and
assignment indexing. Collocation is the grouping together, whether in a catalog or
physical collection, of materials by type. Modern libraries using the Dewey
Decimal or Library of Congress classiﬁcation systems achieve collocation by
assigning a call number to each item, which is a precise code denoting where the
item is to be shelved. Coded within that call number, typically, is the item’s subject
focus (astrophysics, for example), or genre (ﬁction, for instance). Beyond the ﬁrst
portion of the call number indicating the general subject focus or genre of a work, a
further subdivision is often made by author’s surname, geographic focus, or some
other narrower category (see Fig. 12.3).
This arrangement maximizes the potential for serendipitous discovery while
exploring a library collection or catalog, as a user setting out to retrieve a particular
item may encounter a trove of items on their topic of interest located or listed
nearby. Shelf collocation can be reproduced virtually in many online library cata-
logs through a call number search feature. As demonstrated in Fig. 12.4, by
specifying a call number or range of call numbers, a group of records organized in
call number order can be browsed virtually before going to the shelf (though some
electronic resources will be listed only in the catalog since they cannot be shelved).
Collocation, though useful, poses a challenge for catalogers. Since an item
cannot be in more than one place at one time, collocation requires a cataloger to
decide on just one subject focus or genre for the purpose of locating an item with
similar items. However, items may not be so easy to classify in terms of predicting
how users might seek them. For instance, in Hypothetical University Library, an
animated ﬁlm such as “The Lorax,” based on the book by Dr. Seuss, might be
shelved with all other animated ﬁlms under Library of Congress Classiﬁcation
system call number NC1766. Though this makes sense, a user might, quite logi-
cally, search speciﬁcally for ﬁlms on the topic of conservation of natural resources.
Though “The Lorax” addresses this theme, if the user were to browse the shelving
Fig. 12.3 Anatomy of a Library of Congress call number
12
Toward Seamless Access: Libraries from Alexandria Through the Digital Age
305

area where ﬁlms on conservation are located at Hypothetical University Library,
they would clearly miss “The Lorax.”
This is where assignment indexing comes in handy. Assignment indexing is the
practice of “tagging” bibliographic records (in a modern online library catalog, a
bibliographic record is a web page describing an item and providing its shelf
location or, if it is an electronic resource, a link to its virtual location) with subject
headings from a standardized list of descriptors such as the Library of Congress
Subject Headings or Sears List in order to create multiple subject access points.
According to the Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science, an access
point is “a unit of information in a bibliographic record under which a person may
search for and identify items…” [7]. Often times, catalogers will assign multiple
subject access points in the form of subject headings to a bibliographic record in
order to accommodate a variety of approaches to searching for an item. For
example, a bibliographic record for “The Lorax” may, in addition to “conservation
of natural resources–juvenile ﬁlms” contain the subject heading “pollution–juvenile
ﬁlms” just in case users decide to search using the term “pollution” instead of
“conservation of natural resources.”
Subject headings are an example of a controlled vocabulary. By agreeing to use
a controlled vocabulary, or standardized list of terms, in order to “tag” items,
catalogers enable searching across multiple databases or library catalogs simulta-
neously. Since many libraries that own “The Lorax,” for instance, are likely to use
the pre-determined Library of Congress Subject Heading “conservation of natural
resources” to index this, and similar items, it is possible to target these items with a
subject search across the holdings of multiple libraries. In addition to enhancing
Fig. 12.4 Results of a call number range search targeting items on natural disasters demonstrating
the collocation of items by subject, as they would be collocated on the shelf
306
B. Havens and J. Rosenfeld

access to items by allowing users to search for them in multiple ways, subject
headings in a modern online library catalog enable hypertext cross-indexing. While
viewing the bibliographic record for an item, such as “The Lorax,” users may
navigate to similar items within a catalog or database by clicking on the subject
headings that are attached to that record. Clicking “pollution–juvenile ﬁlms,” for
instance, would produce a list of items sharing that descriptor, such as “Bill Nye the
Science Guy Pollution Solutions.”
Though they have been reﬁned substantially in the last 150 years, it is worth
noting that systems of collocation and assignment indexing date back to ancient
libraries. For example, the collections of Assyrian king Assurbanipal (see
Fig. 12.5), who ruled from 668 to 627 B.C.E., consisting of thousands of clay
tablets (upon which were inscribed some of the dire threats against irresponsible
Fig. 12.5 Stele featuring
sculpture of Assurbanipal [3]
12
Toward Seamless Access: Libraries from Alexandria Through the Digital Age
307

borrowers mentioned earlier in this chapter), were collocated by means of a rela-
tively complex scheme. One room of his palace contained tablets relating to gov-
ernment and history [5]. Other portions of the collection divided up by subject
included geography, laws and legal decisions, legends and mythology, and com-
mercial records [5]. Within each room, a shelf list detailing the titles of works
contained therein was afﬁxed to the wall [5]. In addition, tablets that were analo-
gous to a subject catalog or descriptive bibliography were found in the rooms. Each
of these special tablets offered descriptive details about the other tablets contained
in that room including titles of each work, the number of tablets for that work, the
ﬁrst few words, the number of lines, and symbols indicating location or classiﬁ-
cation [5].
The Library of Alexandria, which was founded in approximately 300 B.C.E.
serves as another early example of advanced library organizational systems.
Callimachus of Cyrene, a scholar at Alexandria, can be considered one of the early
pioneers of assignment indexing. Among his many contributions, Callimachus
enhanced access to the alphabetically-ordered collection of the library, which was
comprised of hundreds of thousands of works on papyrus rolls. He did so by
compiling shelf-lists and bibliographical works including Tables of Persons
Eminent in Every Branch of Learning Together with a List of Their Writings, a
survey of all Greek writings that was so extensive that it was comprised of ﬁve
times the number of volumes that contained Homer’s Iliad [2]. Callimachus broke
the authors featured in this work into broad genre categories and then made ﬁner
distinctions from there, grouping them by their literary specialty: dramatic poets,
epic poets, philosophers, comedy writers, historians, etc., [2].
12.4
Floundering in a Sea of Information: The Web
and Information Literacy
In libraries during the early to mid-1990s, the use of print indexes declined sharply
as CD-ROM and web-based databases greatly expanded access to metadata and
digital content such as full-text versions of periodical articles. This marked the
beginning of a period of widespread outsourcing of digital collections and a
relinquishment of the meticulous level of control over the selection process that
librarians had exercised over physical collections. Prior to this point, though a
relatively small number of online research databases had been available before the
advent of the World Wide Web, the bulk of a library’s holdings had been limited to
what could be stored within the walls of library buildings. Many, if not most, of the
items in those buildings had been vetted carefully by librarians with regard to
accuracy, authoritativeness, or other quality-oriented collection development cri-
teria. The inclusion of these massive subscription-driven databases, each contain-
ing, potentially, tens of thousands of records along with articles from hundreds of
periodicals has made it unfeasible for librarians to continue to apply rigorous
308
B. Havens and J. Rosenfeld

selection standards to each and every item in a collection. Furthermore, after those
databases are acquired they continue to morph as content is added or subtracted by
the database provider.
In terms of content newly available to users, library databases are just the tip of
the iceberg. By 1994, with access to user-friendly, web-based search engines and
web indexes such as Yahoo!, Lycos, and Infoseek, researchers and casual users alike
had expanded their reach beyond the walls of physical libraries via the World Wide
Web. Presented with information in new formats that had not been pre-selected by
librarians or vetted through established publishers, many struggled to distinguish
between reliable and unreliable content, lack the savvy to formulate search strategies
that would help them manage the overwhelming number of search results they were
presented with. Stoker and Cooke summed up the problem in 1994:
Information posted on to the network does not go through the same rigorous review
procedures as information which has passed through formal publishing channels. The
facility has been described as ‘clogged with too much junk to make its use effective’ and the
information ‘ephemeral and of questionable quality…’ On occasions it might be difﬁcult to
determine the originating institution or individual for an item [8].
In a 1998 survey, the Pew Research Center determined that 41 % of adults were
using the internet, up from 23 % in 1996 [9]. Despite the potential pitfalls of using
the web noted by Stoker and Cooke four years earlier, in 1998, 49 % of web users
believed “that Internet news is more accurate than news found in traditional print
and broadcast outlets” [10]. Around that same time, some researchers discovered
that this user conﬁdence in the web may have been unwarranted: an analysis of 41
web pages offering health advice concluded that “only a few web sites provided
complete and accurate information” which indicated “an urgent need to check
public oriented healthcare information on the internet for accuracy, completeness,
and consistency” [11].
The results of another study in 2000 indicated that consumers of web-based
information either lacked the skills to evaluate the reliability of websites or were
relatively unconcerned about its origin or trustworthiness. In the study, nearly 1000
respondents were asked to rate how often they applied basic criteria for evaluating
the validity of websites such as “check to see who the author of the website is,”
“consider whether the views presented are opinions or facts” and “consider the
author’s goals/objectives…” [12]. Mean response scores for all but one of the nine
criteria fell between values used to indicate a frequency of “rarely” and “never”
with regards to applying each of the criteria [12].
The problem persists. By 2010, 79 % of American adults had become internet
users [13] and in 2012, the Pew Research Center published the results of another
survey indicating that many of them may be generally uncritical of websites
appearing in search engine results. The survey concluded that “roughly two-thirds
of searchers (66 %) say search engines are a fair and unbiased source of infor-
mation.” 28 % of respondents indicated that “all or almost all” of the information
12
Toward Seamless Access: Libraries from Alexandria Through the Digital Age
309

they get in their search engine search results is “fair and trustworthy” and an
additional 45 % indicated that “most” is “fair and trustworthy” [14]. However,
despite this high degree of conﬁdence in search engines, “four in ten searchers” said
“they have gotten conﬂicting or contradictory search results and could not ﬁgure out
what information was correct. About four in ten also…” said “…they have gotten
so much information in a set of search results that they felt overwhelmed” [14].
Assisting clients with internet use has been a major component of many li-
brarians’ job duties for nearly two decades. As a result, they have been ﬁrst-hand
witnesses to users’ struggles with the relatively new responsibility of evaluating
documents and sites they encounter on the web. Critical thinking about the origin of
sources, about the publishing process, and about the appropriateness of a source in
terms of meeting an information need have always been a part of doing research,
regardless of whether information is located on the web or in print. However, the
challenge of determining the reliability of web-based information requires a new set
of critical thinking skills to be applied in new contexts. As the Association of
College and Research Libraries states, the “sheer abundance of information will not
in itself create a more informed citizenry without a complementary cluster of
abilities necessary to use information effectively” [15].
In order to address the need for these skills, many librarian positions now
emphasize teaching as a major component of the job. Before the advent of the world
wide web, typically, librarians provided “orientations” or bibliographic instruction
geared towards using card catalogs or online public access catalogs and navigating
the collections which they had carefully vetted for reliability. Over the last 15 years,
however, librarians have shifted their efforts towards providing instruction oriented
around deeper critical thinking skills often referred to as information literacy.
Information literacy, as a skill set, is highly applicable to online environments as it
empowers users to “recognize when information is needed and have the ability to
locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information” [15].
Analyses of librarian job advertisements have reﬂected this shift towards a
greater instructional role. For instance, in 2002, 54.6 % of librarian job descriptions
examined on an international job posting website over a 3 month period indicated
that “user education or training is an important part of the job” [16]. In 2013 another
study was published that gathered data from supervisors at organizations that had
posted librarian job announcements on the American Library Association’s job
website. The study concluded that for 65 % of the jobs, instruction skills “were a
required qualiﬁcation.” For an additional 34 % of the jobs, instructions skills “were
a preferred qualiﬁcation.” Only one response did not list instruction as belonging to
either category [17].
Librarians teach in a variety of contexts, including credit-bearing university
courses, public library workshops, and in online environments. Some also consider
one-on-one interactions with users at the reference desk or elsewhere to be an
extension of that teaching role. Regardless of the context, by re-envisioning their
profession and adapting to their clients’ needs, librarians are empowering users to
become critical consumers of information.

Library 2.0 and the Rise of Next-Generation Library
Search Interfaces
The Web 2.0 movement that began in the early 2000s has been characterized, in
part, by a shift from static web pages to interactive pages, platforms, and appli-
cations that enable users to contribute and collaborate in a variety of ways. This
user-oriented approach to design has also extended to providing a simple, intuitive,
and streamlined online experience. Early social media sites such as Friendster,
photo sharing site Flickr, and social bookmarking sites such as Del.icio.us were
pioneers of the phenomenon that has changed drastically the way we communicate
and engage with information. Web 2.0 also put publishing in the hands of the
masses; without knowledge of web programming languages, many users were able,
for the ﬁrst time, to shape the content of the web by using wikis, blogs, and simple
web-page creation applications such as Google Sites. Web sites began to invite
users to comment and rate content, or even to enhance access to that content via
tagging, a crowd-sourced form of assigning subject descriptors that is also known
as folksonomy.
Since the advent of Web 2.0, libraries have followed suit by enhancing the
interactive capabilities of their websites and contracting with vendors who spe-
cialize in incorporating dynamic and interactive capabilities into library catalogs.
As a result, navigating the online presences of most libraries has become a more
participatory experience for users. Access to library resources and services via
online public access catalogs (OPACS) has improved drastically over the traditional
catalogs in use prior to what is often referred to as Library 2.0. Traditional, or
“legacy” catalogs, according to renown library technology consultant Marshall
Breeding in 2007, were overly complex, lacked engaging features, and were “un-
able to deliver online content” [18].
The ideals of Library 2.0 were epitomized by information architect Casey
Bisson’s development of a library OPAC overlay interface (which works in concert
with an existing OPAC, rather than replacing it) based on the popular open source
WordPress blogging software. The project, called Scriblio, was born out of
Bisson’s conviction “that libraries must use, expose, and make their data available
in new ways” [19]. The use of the WordPress platform brought library catalog
records up from the deep web where they had long been buried, making them
discoverable via search engines and therefore, indexable by users of social book-
marking services. Scriblio, originally called “WordPress OPAC,” which was
announced on Bisson’s blog in early 2006 [20], offered several capabilities beyond
those available from traditional OPACs in use at the time. Among those
improvements were faceted searching (options for limiting or reﬁning one’s search
after the initial query has been submitted) and browsing via tag clouds. Within
catalog records displayed in the Scriblio interface, similar items were suggested and
accessible via hyperlink. Users were also able to comment on catalog items, and by
subscribing via RSS, they could receive automatic updates detailing changes to the
catalog [21].

Open-source integrated library systems, or ILSs, (library management software
which includes the OPAC) such as Evergreen offered similar enhancements to the
traditional OPAC. Despite the improvements they brought and the fact that they
were free, open-source catalog overlay interfaces such as Scriblio, and open-source
OPACs have been adopted by relatively few institutions. This is possibly due to the
fact that some libraries may be daunted by the prospect of limited technical support
for such products (being largely community-based, rather than provided by the
vendor) and their reputation among some for having the buggy aspects of a beta
quality platform [22]. Furthermore, few libraries have the type of in-house pro-
gramming expertise that Lamson Library at Plymouth State University, which
employed Casey Bisson, did. Another possible reason is that by 2007, commercial
ILS vendors such as Polaris Library Systems, OCLC, and Innovative Interfaces, Inc.
had taken notice of these “next-generation OPACS” and enhancements developed
by Library 2.0 pioneers like Bisson, and had scrambled to improve their own
OPACS [23] by adding dynamic features or by offering new products altogether.
Additional Web 2.0 functionalities to existing OPACs were offered by a variety of
third-party developers such as Library Thing for Libraries (see Fig. 12.6), a com-
mercial service which incorporates some navigation features similar to those of
Fig. 12.6 Search results processed by a next-generation catalog that incorporates Library Thing
for Libraries. Note the faceted search options on the left for narrowing the list of results by a
variety of criteria, including user ratings

Scriblio and has evolved to offer users the ability to rate, review, and tag items dis-
played in libary catalogs. By incorporating third-party enhancements such as Library
Thing for Libraries and overlaying user-contributed content over the elements of the
traditional library catalog, the next-generation OPAC has become the “mash-up” of
the library world. Since the advent of the next generation catalog, this theme of
integration in library search interfaces has expanded much further along towards
realizing Marshall Breeding’s position that, in “an ideal world, the content of all the
library’s collections would be available through a single search interface” [18].
12.6
Integrating the Search Process
With the growth of the internet, electronic scholarly journal publishing has also
seen an explosion in prevalence. Libraries increasingly license e-journal content (in
packages from publishers, single titles, or, most commonly, via database aggre-
gators). E-journal packages and databases allow libraries to dramatically increase
the depth and breadth of content available to their patrons—usually at a fraction of
the cost of subscribing to or purchasing titles individually. As library patrons
experience improved access, they also come to expect that access to be to the digital
form of an article—not a physical copy they must locate on a library shelf. But as
access has expanded, the need has grown to enable even greater access (to refer-
enced articles in an article of interest or to the full text of articles with citation
and/or abstract information in a particular database).
12.7
Search Process: OpenURL Resolvers
In the late 1990s, OpenURL Resolvers (also referred to as link resolvers) entered
the scene to address these desired research enhancements. While at ﬁrst not much
more than static links to articles on a publisher’s web site, link resolvers soon
developed a standardized syntax that allowed for metadata (information about the
journal’s ISSN, title, article title, author, volume, date, and page numbers, etc.) to
be passed from links in one database or platform, query a “knowledge base” pro-
vided by an OpenURL vendor to which the library subscribes, and into the full text
content, which could reside anywhere else within the library’s e-holdings. The ﬁrst
commercially available link resolver, SFX, was released in 2001 by Ex Libris [24].
Through a subscription to this product, libraries could provide information to a
vendor about the e-journals, databases, and e-serials packages to which they had
access. Ex Libris would then coordinate with the vendors to maintain updated title
and date coverage lists within a knowledge base to ensure links reached their
appropriate targets [25]. Soon other providers began offering these services. Some
examples include EBSCO’s LinkSource, Serials Solutions’ (later acquired by
ProQuest) 360Link, and OCLC’s WorldCat Knowledge Base. Figure 12.7 provides
12
Toward Seamless Access: Libraries from Alexandria Through the Digital Age
313

an example of an interstitial OpenURL results screen with both article-level and
journal-level links available.
By the time Google Scholar launched in November of 2004, libraries were able
to work with their OpenURL provider to send their holdings information to Google.
This resulted in libraries being able to connect with more potential users who may
have been starting their research with Google instead of library resources. Allowing
for IP-authentication, all users on an academic campus searching Google Scholar
would automatically see information about connecting to their results via their
library resources right from the search results list. Libraries could conﬁgure the text
of the link as well. While this process has hardly been foolproof, as it relies on
webcrawler-indexed metadata on Google’s side matching up with metadata sup-
plied by content providers; it has provided a way for libraries to link their holdings
up using OpenURL technology with what their patrons were locating on the open
web (and may otherwise have been prompted to pay for on their own). Figure 12.8
demonstrates the search results screen a user might see in Google Scholar if his/her
library has sent their holdings information to Google.
OpenURL resolvers have not been without issue, however. They can be
expensive—beyond the reach of a small library’s budget—further exacerbating
digital divide issues, where library users in smaller communities with less
well-funded libraries then do not have access to technology that aids in their dis-
covery of and connection to information. Also, since the success of a link can
depend upon the complete matchup in metadata between the provider hosting the
Fig. 12.7 Example of an OpenURL results screen with links to content
314
B. Havens and J. Rosenfeld

content and the provider indexing the content (frequently two different vendors),
false negatives and positives can often result. That is, the OpenURL resolver may
return information stating that the library does not have access to an article that it
actually does have access to. Or, conversely, the resolver may link to a database
where it states the article should be found, but the library does not have access to
that article via any of its subscriptions. Understandably, this can be confusing to
users.
In a 2010 study, two librarians found the mean total success rate for SFX (across
links to books, newspapers, dissertations, and journal articles) was only 71 % [26].
This causes great frustration for librarians who will often be referred from the
technical support desk of the indexing vendor to the tech support of the
content-provider to the tech support of their OpenURL/Knowledge base provider.
Full resolution may take days, weeks, months, or not come at all, and librarians new
to e-resource management may be confused about where to begin. Some of this can
also be the fault of the knowledge base vendor—who may have neglected to add,
delete, or modify coverage dates of a title residing within a particular database.
The need to maintain an updated knowledge base cannot be under-stressed.
OpenURL vendors must continuously update their information and libraries must
also remain vigilant whenever they add or subtract from their e-collections or when
a collection changes platforms or title. Failure to do so results in broken links for
Fig. 12.8 Example of a Google Scholar results screen where a library has sent their e-serials
holdings to Google
12
Toward Seamless Access: Libraries from Alexandria Through the Digital Age
315

patrons. Additionally, some publishers, as a rule, do not allow for links directly to
the article level. They may stop at the issue level or even the journal title level in an
attempt to encourage libraries or end users to pay for subscriptions (electronic or
print) directly to their journal titles. Often, librarians will not be aware of which
vendors have these practices until they or their patrons encounter problematic links.
Price and Trainor (2010) encourage libraries to thoroughly review content providers
in order to have knowledge of which do not allow article-level links [27].
12.8
Search Process: Federated Searching
While OpenURL resolvers do allow for communication between databases, library
patrons increasingly expect that their searches will return all results held by the
library—not just some. Federated search (or metasearching) arrived in the mar-
ketplace in the late 1990s/early 2000s with what librarians hoped would provide a
Google-like experience for end users [28]. Federated search claimed to make the
idea of a “one stop shop” for searching all library resources a possibility. Users do
not want to become experts in the various interfaces employed by library databases.
Federated searches appeal to the novice user and the experienced user alike [29].
However, the way federated searching and Google work are entirely different.
Through automated web crawling, Google is able to pre-index website content,
returning results very quickly when users search. There are limitations, however.
Google cannot search the deep web—content within subscription databases, data
sets stored as ﬁles on government websites, orphan resources that are not linked to
from anywhere else, dynamic content generated on the ﬂy, and other resources to
which libraries and librarians can provide access [30]. Federated searching, on the
other hand, sends out queries to multiple databases (often including the library’s
online public access catalog, or OPAC) which are maintained by different vendors
on different platforms with different indexing and different types of search protocols
(XML—which uses a type of tagging of search elements—vs. Z39.50—a
library-speciﬁc search protocol developed before the web—vs. the federated search
vendor cobbling together a search strategy to access diverse resources) [29].
So, while a library’s federated search product will return items on the deep web
(indexed by library-subscribed resources) that are unavailable or largely invisible to
Google, it also will do so at a much slower speed. Users may get a Google-like
single search box, but the results will not populate their screen instantaneously as
with Google. Instead, the federated search calls out to databases separately and
returns results separately, as they are retrieved from the native databases. This leads
to a list of non-ranked, non-de-duplicated results. Librarians may understand that
these results need to be combed through carefully, but end users are used to the
most relevant results showing up at the top of the screen. That might not always
happen with federated searching. Another limitation is the fact that most federated
searches are most effective when searching no more than a dozen resources [31].
316
B. Havens and J. Rosenfeld

When most large academic libraries subscribe to 60, 90, or over 100 electronic
resources, patrons certainly are not getting a true “one stop shop.”
How do users feel federated search compares to the Google experience? A 2013
study by Helen Georgas offers a comparison. Undergraduate students at Brooklyn
College were asked to ﬁnd one book, two articles (one scholarly) and one additional
source of their choice using two search tools—a federated search and a Google
search. The federated search tool was conﬁgured to search 11 databases including
the library’s OPAC. 81 % of students said Google was easier to use, with one
commenting, “because it was faster.” When asked which search they liked better,
the students were evenly split between Google and the federated search. 59 % of
the students said they would use the federated search tool on future assignments and
56 % would recommend it to fellow students. Among their complaints about the
federated search, students felt it was difﬁcult to ﬁnd books and too slow overall.
Their complaints about Google related to ﬁnding too many irrelevant results and
being asked to pay for content. Some students mentioned they wished the library
had the federated search, when in fact, the library had subscribed to the service for
years. Students also remarked that they had difﬁculty identifying the types of
sources retrieved in the federated search. Whereas Google and Google Scholar
identify results by type of material, the federated search simply tags results with the
database from which they were retrieved (although librarians felt the type of
information was fairly obvious based on the fact that the OPAC results were all
physical items and mostly books). These ﬁndings point to the need to make sure
library patrons are more educated about services and features [32].
Despite the fact that they enable discovery of quality sources and students ﬁnd
them useful, it is obvious that federated searches have their serious limitations.
First, the speed of the service is dictated by the slowest-performing of the remote
database connections. Similarly, the fastest-performing remote connection will
always have its results listed on top—leading to a potential problem of
falsely-perceived relevance. Large result sets (as would typically result from a
broad search by a novice user—the very type of user and search for which federated
search was developed!) cause problems. Due to the time involved in retrieving these
large remote result sets, results are typically truncated by the federated search
service and any de-duplication or relevance ranking within results sets is then
performed on only a small subset [31].
From the librarian’s perspective, implementing a federated search product can be
frustrating—taking months to launch. And what has been billed as the one stop
search is most often far from it. In addition to the fact that the federated search
works better when no more than a dozen resources are selected, there is the issue of
some vendors refusing to participate in federated search development—rendering
their content invisible to federated search users. And because federated search
requires some translation across database collections, if a vendor is slow to develop
or ﬁx that translator, resources on that platform may be excluded as well [33].
Furthermore, with so much reliance on one product (the federated search)
needing to utilize the different types of indexing employed by the disparate content
vendors, it is very difﬁcult to make use of database limiters, truncation, or wildcard
12
Toward Seamless Access: Libraries from Alexandria Through the Digital Age
317

searching effectively. Different databases may use these advanced search tools
differently (or not offer them at all). Attempting to search across different platforms
limits the functional search tools to the lowest common denominator across the
databases. If search settings in the federated search product are adjusted to get better
results from one particular database, the rest of the results may suffer. As Jody
Condit Fagan (2011), the editor of the Journal of Web Librarianship, puts it: “Who
knows if bad results are from the databases searched, the federated search software,
or one’s own search strategy? Results are messy and duplicative, and users fre-
quently can’t tell what the items returned actually are” (p. 77) [34]. So what do
librarians do with all of the resources that cannot be included or searched effectively
in a federated search? They are back to needing to teach users how to search all of
the various interfaces individually and select the best resources for an information
need (if those users can even ﬁnd the resources within the depths of the library’s
website ﬁrst!).
12.9
Search Process: Web-Scale Discovery
So, then, to truly move into the Google-like search realm with better speed and
more reliable and customizable results, a centralized search model needs to be in
place. This is what a few vendors began doing next, and in 2009, Serials Solutions
(now part of ProQuest) was ﬁrst to the library market with their launch of the
Summon discovery service. Web-scale discovery services are the next generation in
library resource searching [31].
Unlike federated searches, discovery services return results quickly and in
relevancy-ranked order. Once results are returned, the discovery layer (or search
interface) allows the user to reﬁne and sort results using facets (e.g., year of pub-
lication, author, language, subject, publication type, or database source). The user is
linked to full text via either direct links (if the resource is also hosted on the
discovery service vendor’s platform) or using OpenURL technology.
This model scales well to the size of the web because content and metadata have
been indexed in advance of a user’s search. With the increased capacity and
reduced cost of data storage, the creation of this type of a centralized index (which
is at the heart of all web-scale discovery services) became possible [31]. Within the
central index are both the library’s local resources and licensed e-content. The
library works with the vendor to load its OPAC records into the centralized index
(for information about items held physically in the library). Along with this type of
local content, libraries may also include metadata for institutional repositories of
student and faculty work and/or locally digitized collections. On the more external
side, metadata and full-text content from licensed and open access publishers and
content providers can be selected for inclusion. Many discovery services have also
licensed content from third-party vendors for inclusion in their central index,
regardless of whether the library subscribes to that particular resource on its own.
Content available to the library through subscriptions to database aggregators (e.g.,
318
B. Havens and J. Rosenfeld

APA’s
PsycNet,
ProQuest’s
Research
Library,
EBSCO’s
Business
Source
Premiere, etc.) may also be included. However, this type of content needs to be
mutually licensed by both the library and the discovery vendor. Since many of the
discovery vendors are also in the ﬁeld of licensing e-content and providing access
on their own proprietary platforms, they may choose not to make the metadata for
and links to these resources available to other discovery vendors. In this way, not all
of a library’s e-resources will necessarily be available for inclusion in the cen-
tralized index of their discovery service [35].
Because the content is pre-indexed, all of the advanced search options frequently
unavailable in federated searching are available to the user of a discovery service.
Truncation, wild card, exact phrase searching, and use of Boolean operators are all
possible. While discovery services all have these basic characteristics in common,
there are differences among them. There are several vendors in the marketplace at
this point. Perhaps the four with the largest market share are Summon (formerly
launched by Serials Solutions, which has since been bought by ProQuest), Ex
Libris’ Primo Central, EBSCO’s EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS), and OCLC’s
WorldCat Local (although they also have a new WorldCat Discovery product just
launched in March of 2014).
Summon bills itself as: “the only discovery service based on a uniﬁed index of
content. More than 90 content types, 9000 publishers, 100,000 journals and peri-
odicals, and 1 billion records are represented in the index. New content sources are
added every week and content updated daily.” With their “Match and Merge”
technology, Summon ingests content from various providers, “combin[ing] meta-
data, including discipline-speciﬁc vocabularies, with full-text content when avail-
able to create a single record” for each resource [36]. Figure 12.9 shows an example
results screen from a search in Summon. More information about items in the
results list (abstract, authors, dates) is also shown in the right margin when hovering
over a particular result.
EBSCO, which is also a major content provider and has established relationships
with diverse publishers, is able to leverage its existing resources to include native
database indexing (which is frequently performed by subject experts in the ﬁeld for
inclusion in an individual, subject-speciﬁc database and adds value) and
subject-speciﬁc controlled vocabularies in its discovery service [37].
OCLC has a unique position in the marketplace as it sees itself as
“content-neutral.” Having gotten out of the business of hosting third-party data-
bases, it claims to be able to build relationships with a larger variety of content
providers more easily [38]. And certainly, this is an issue. Some database vendors
are also in the web-scale discovery business and do not wish to provide all of their
indexing or content to competitors. For instance, EBSCO currently refuses to
provide its content to Ex Libris for inclusion in Primo Central [39].
Libraries have had to develop their own awkward workarounds, and in the end,
patrons are not served well. This debate has been well-documented and brought to
public attention by the Orbis-Cascade Alliance [40], a nonproﬁt library consortium
of 37 colleges and universities in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. In a letter from
the alliance dated October 6, 2014, to both vendors, regarding their failure to
12
Toward Seamless Access: Libraries from Alexandria Through the Digital Age
319

resolve the stalemate, the Orbis-Cascade Board of Directors state: “This failure to
act is unacceptable and strongly suggests that both companies value business
gamesmanship over customer satisfaction and short-term gain over service to stu-
dents, faculty, and researchers. The library community expects an explanation and
we call upon EBSCO and Ex Libris to provide a public update and projection of
when this impasse will be resolved. As a major customer, the Orbis Cascade
Alliance membership expects to spend in excess of $30 million with EBSCO and
Ex Libris over the next ﬁve years. With these issues left unresolved, we will now
take active steps to reconsider the shape and scope of future business with EBSCO
and Ex Libris.” [41].
Discovery services have been very popular upon implementation. In a January,
2014 survey of nearly 400 libraries using discovery services, overall satisfaction
with the products ranged from 6.26 to 6.95 on a 9-point scale. Marshall Breeding
[42] found that overall satisfaction was highest with users of EBSCO Discovery
Service and lowest with Primo Central. Interestingly, all discovery services had
higher popularity scores among undergraduates than among graduate students or
faculty. This could be in part due to issues with known-item searching. Faculty and
graduate students are more likely to be searching for a speciﬁc resource (a journal
article, book, image), and discovery services are better at exposing a large range of
resources to the searcher.
Fig. 12.9 An example of a search results screen in Summon, a web-scale discovery service
320

Web-scale discovery still remains out of the budget range of many libraries.
A 2010 review of Summon, EDS, and WorldCat Local published in The Charleston
Advisor [43] described the pricing of these services as ranging from $9000 to over
$100,000 per year depending on the size of the library’s collection, size of popu-
lation served, and optional add-on services (incorporating institutional repositories,
enhanced book content, building connections to additional resources not included in
the provider’s central index). Despite this, it could be argued that the cost/beneﬁt
ratio is in the favor of acquiring a discovery product. Users ﬁnally do get closer to
utilizing a single search, and the library’s e-resources receive greater exposure and
usage. Discovery services are also generally mobile-friendly and can incorporate
most, if not all, of the content of a library’s OPAC. Additionally, because these
services are hosted by the vendor, libraries do not need to worry about server or
software upgrades [44].
So, what’s next? Is there territory beyond web-scale discovery? Certainly dis-
covery services are continuing to improve. Librarians need to remain closely
involved in the development of these tools—making sure to customize library
products to best meet the needs of the type of users they serve [39]. With the move
to a single search portal, librarians may be able to devote more time to the
development of local “born digital” collections and institutional repositories—and
utilize the discovery service as a way of making that content more visible to the end
users. Discovery services may help librarians stay more current and relevant in the
eyes of patrons who are always expecting a Google-like experience, but education
is still key. Users need to know the basics about evaluating information, considering
results for relevancy, and identifying the types of information being retrieved.
Librarians are experts in these areas.
12.10
Integrating Services: Library Consortia
As electronic resources available to librarians continue to increase in their depth and
breadth of coverage and complexity of access models, libraries have turned to
consortial models to help manage these workﬂows. Library consortia are not new.
There is evidence of early consortial behavior back into the late 19th century as
groups of libraries have banded together to share cataloging, participate in a very
rudimentary form of interlibrary loan, and purchase cooperatively [45]. This sec-
tion, however, will focus on how library consortia work today.
Libraries license content and/or platforms for access from vendors. Unlike books
or videos the library purchases, these items are frequently leased, and not owned.
As a result, they have a range of restrictions not found in the purchases of physical
formats [46]. The license agreements for e-resources can be tedious, and individual
libraries may not have the expertise to fully understand and negotiate these con-
tracts in their own best interest. Concerns arise over which resources allow remote
access to afﬁliated users only and which will allow more relaxed rules. There are
also questions about what electronic content may be used to ﬁll interlibrary loan
12

requests from other libraries. Database license agreements are not consistent across
the
board,
and
e-resource
license
management
can
be
overwhelmingly
time-consuming if performed thoroughly. Most libraries do not have the staff to
spare for this singular function nor the legal expertise to do this, and this is one
niche that consortia have been able to ﬁll.
Library consortia can negotiate with vendors on behalf of all of their member
institutions. Some may have experts in license agreements on their staff or rely upon
committees of librarians from member institutions to review agreements from
newly-licensed content before offering them to member libraries for purchase.
Consortia can also offer content to libraries that the individual libraries may not
have been able to afford on their own. When purchasing together, consortia can
purchase large e-journal packages for their member institutions. On a per-title basis,
individual libraries are paying much less for these titles than they would if they
purchased their own subscriptions on an a la carte basis. Consortia are also able to
negotiate with vendors to suppress cost increases with more power than individual
libraries negotiating ever could [47]. They can reject dramatic cost increases, object
to restrictive licensing terms, and achieve better discounts overall. End users beneﬁt
because they have access to more expensive, niche resources.
In addition to performing cooperative purchasing and licensing of databases and
other e-resources, consortia may also work together to offer interlibrary loan ser-
vices. Some consortia, like OhioLINK (formed in Ohio in 1989 and composed of
90 public and private academic libraries plus the State Library of Ohio) [48] and the
Orbis Cascade Alliance (comprised of 37 academic libraries in the Paciﬁc
Northwest, formed in 2003 from a merger of the Orbis and Cascade Alliances,
which originated in the early 1990s), [49] have partnered with vendors to create
consortial library catalogs. These catalogs enable borrowing and lending among
member libraries in a way that is more seamless to the library patron (who may
simply just place a hold with one click, rather than ﬁlling out an interlibrary loan
form). In the case of the OCA, the consortium actually shares an integrated library
system (ILS) which is responsible for not only the public catalog (OPAC) but also
the back end staff circulation, acquisitions, reporting, and cataloging functions. This
allows items to be checked out as if they were from one large library with many
branches, as opposed to individually siloed libraries with their own ILS software,
circulation rules, and processing procedures. And again, the library patrons beneﬁt
because a much larger array of resources is being presented for their use at a
reduced cost and expedited processing speed [50].
Even outside of ofﬁcial consortial agreements (which may offer library patrons
reciprocal borrowing privileges or fee-free interlibrary loans among member
institutions), interlibrary loan has continued to rise in popularity. Discovery services
present patrons with more results than ever before, and the sponsoring library will
not own all of those items. Interlibrary Loan request links are placed prominently
within non-owned search results allowing for an e-commerce-like experience for
patrons who are used to purchasing items through Amazon with one click [51].
Figure 12.10 shows what this looks like inside the library catalog of a library using
OCLC’s WorldCat Local. Generally, interlibrary loan is free for academic library
322
B. Havens and J. Rosenfeld

users or there may be a nominal fee. Interlibrary loan allows libraries to provide
access to content for their patrons for which they could not otherwise justify paying
full price or even acquiring at all. The modern interlibrary loan framework was
largely created by OCLC (formerly the Ohio College Library Center and now the
Online Computer Library Center) with its WorldCat product. Beginning as the
OCLC Online Library Union Catalog in 1971, it later developed into WorldCat (in
1996) and developed into the freely available and searchable WorldCat.org in 2006.
By authenticating to their home library, patrons searching WorldCat can request
items via its union catalog (which represents the holdings of libraries—both
physical and electronic—all over the world) [52].
12.11
Integrating Services: Vendor Partnerships
Vendor partnerships can be valuable for libraries. Opportunities in this arena are
increasing all of the time. One such relatively new development is the introduction
of cloud-based, full-featured, integrated library systems (ILS). These new products
are also being offered by vendors who, in the past, did not get involved with full
library solutions. For example, OCLC introduced its WorldShare Management
Services (WMS) in July of 2011. Now, over 300 libraries worldwide are using the
service [53]. OCLC’s WMS includes modules for acquisitions, e-resource man-
agement (knowledge base, metadata, and OpenURL), circulation, analytics, inter-
library loan, discovery (the system also acts as a web-scale discovery service), and
an optional license manager for online resources. The price and work involved on
the part of the library in migrating to a new cloud-based ILS like WMS is

12

323

considerable. However, the library and the end users will beneﬁt as eventually the
library can reduce costs by consolidating all of these activities in one service.
Separate subscriptions with diverse vendors for managing e-resources, providing
the library catalog, adding enhanced content to the library catalog (like book cover
images and review information), offering web-scale discovery functionality, and
performing all of the back-end tasks like circulation, acquisitions (the ordering,
invoicing, and receiving of books) and serials management (the placement and
monitoring of subscriptions and electronically checking in of individual journal and
magazine issues) can all be cancelled once the library has fully migrated onto the
new cloud-based platform. Libraries also no longer need to perform frustrating and
time-consuming software upgrades and have custom reports rewritten every time a
new version of a vendor’s ILS is released. There is no longer a need to maintain
hardware within the library or within the university’s IT department. With
cloud-based hosting, new releases are handled centrally and offer new functionality
constantly. While this can be daunting (as at least one person in the library needs to
keep up with the changes to the service), it ultimately offers the highest level of
responsivity to trends in information-seeking and provision. Similar products from
other vendors include Ex Libris’ Alma and ProQuest’s Intota (which is still in
development, with its collection assessment piece launched in November, 2013).
Some legacy ILS vendors have offered products in response, but they generally
exist as optional overlays to the existing system or are built upon existing ILS
infrastructure with some consolidation of services and automation and discovery
products offered by them or their partners. These vendors tout the fact that libraries
can continue using the product they have always been using that contains all of their
data with no need to migrate information to a new and “untested” system [54].
These new services from legacy vendors can be offered as SaaS (software as a
service), so they can be fully hosted. However, the new products from legacy
vendors will need to be implemented within the current hosting framework (with
some libraries hosted in the cloud, some via SaaS, and others locally hosted on their
own hardware). This means the legacy vendors will likely need to support multiple
versions of their new ILS. In contrast, the built from scratch systems are not based
on old legacy code, and updates, patches, and bug ﬁxes can be pushed out to all
users from the development side simultaneously [55].
End users are frequently unaware of these behind the scenes machinations on the
part of their libraries. However, moving to new cloud-based ILS platforms can
result in new workﬂows and reallocated time on the part of library personnel.
With WMS, for example, cataloging is much quicker—with librarians just needing
to select the appropriate master record within WorldCat and attach their institution’s
holdings to it. Libraries can cooperatively manage cataloging by contributing
updates and corrections and additional information that will be added to the master
record for the beneﬁt of all libraries. With this reduced need for copy cataloging
time, librarians working as catalogers may be able to devote time to other projects
like cataloging a unique local collection, or advising on the virtual construction of
an institutional repository.

Integrating Services: Cooperative
Reference Services
Library services extend beyond the discovery of information and provision of
access. Reference, which is at the core of library service, has also been impacted by
collaborative management. The American Library Association deﬁnes reference
transactions as “information consultations in which library staff recommend,
interpret, evaluate, and/or use information resources to help others to meet partic-
ular information needs.” [56] Traditionally, this has taken place in person at a
reference desk in the library or via telephone.
According to a 2012 survey by the National Center for Education Statistics,
74.9 % of all US academic libraries offered some form of virtual reference as well,
with 26.6 % offering chat reference via a commercial service and 32.8 % offering
chat reference via instant messaging applications. This was an increase from 2008,
when 72.1 % of all US academic libraries offered virtual reference. Academic
libraries serving larger populations are more likely to offer some form of virtual
reference [57]. These trends are similar for public libraries [58].
Libraries willing to go it alone have used free instant messaging software like
Yahoo chat, Google Chat, and MSN Messenger. However, those services are not
provider-neutral, so chat aggregators also became popular in libraries (Pidgin,
Meebo). They allowed librarians to receive chat questions from library patrons
using any chat software. However, as stand-alone services, only one librarian could
monitor the chat queue. Additionally, if a librarian needed to transfer a chat ref-
erence question to another librarian, it was quite difﬁcult [59].
In 2008, LibraryH3lp was launched as part of a chat reference collaborative for
reference services provided after-hours at Duke University, UNC Chapel Hill, and
North Carolina State University. It utilizes the open standard XMPP as its chat
protocol, which allows for monitoring of the chat queue by a number of free clients,
such as Pidgin. LibraryH3lp widgets can be inserted into websites, databases,
discovery layers, or subject guides (like LibGuides) for patrons to access at their
point of need [60].
For libraries that want more extensive, 24/7 virtual reference coverage, there are
other (more expensive) products in the marketplace. OCLC offers QuestionPoint,
which is a reference cooperative staffed by librarians from subscribing libraries.
During overnight hours, contract librarians with access to the home institutions’ basic
information about policies and resources, staff the service. This is important to pro-
vide, as many reference questions fall into the basic informational variety (open hours,
directions, information about library ﬁne policies, etc.) Libraries using QuestionPoint
are responsible for stafﬁng it for their users as much as they’d like as well as for
providing coverage a few hours each week to the entire cooperative [61]. When chat
questions are submitted by patrons, they are ﬁrst routed to the home library. If there is
no response, they are then sent out to the library-deﬁned partners (which could be a
consortium or a network of state universities). If there is still no timely response, the
12
Toward Seamless Access: Libraries from Alexandria Through the Digital Age
325

question is sent out to the main QuestionPoint cooperative where any librarian stafﬁng
the service may respond to it [59].
By the end of 2012, approximately 24 % of academic libraries offered some
form of text (SMS) reference service. With this type of service, library users can
send a text message asking for reference assistance. Librarians receive and respond
to the text via a web interface (and do not need to monitor it on their mobile
phones). From 2010 to 2012, text reference service in large public libraries (those
serving 500,000 people or more) increased from 13 to 43 % [62]. Springshare,
which created LibGuides, added text reference capabilities to its LibAnswers suite
via an add-on LibChat module [63]. Mosio for Libraries offers a Text-a-Librarian
service as well as chat and email virtual reference capabilities. My Info Quest, a text
reference cooperative sponsored by the South Regional Library Council of Ithaca,
NY, uses Mosio’s Text-a-Librarian product. It is currently staffed 80 h per week
with plans to increase coverage as more libraries join the service. Text messages
may be sent via LibChat or Mosio’s product but will not get answered until a
librarian is able to respond. Using a cooperative like My Info Quest allows quicker
response to patron reference needs [64].
12.13
Integrating Services: Instant Information
for the End User
In this world of streaming video via Netﬂix and Hulu and streaming music like
Spotify and Pandora, library patrons also want that type of instant access to
information and entertainment from their libraries. Libraries and vendors have
responded with the development of e-book and e-audiobook platforms like
OverDrive, which are readily integrated across a patron’s devices via an app.
OverDrive, which started out in the CD-ROM industry in the 1980s, ﬁrst began
offering downloadable e-books and e-audiobooks to libraries in 2003 [65]. Libraries
can select from OverDrive’s catalog of content and offer what they choose to their
patrons. Content can be integrated into the library catalog and/or searched separately
on the library’s website. Additionally, patrons can download the OverDrive app to
their mobile device or tablet and search directly from within that interface. Library
patrons need to authenticate with their libraries by providing their library card
credentials in order to use the service and view the library’s catalog of OverDrive
content. Within the OverDrive app, patrons may use the native reader to read an
e-book, place holds on titles, or follow a link to check out the Kindle edition directly
from Amazon. Libraries are not restricted by physical shelf space, and as such, may
choose to buy 5, 10, 15, 20, or even 50–100 copies of popular titles to minimize
patron wait times. Some titles may offer libraries the option of purchasing unlimited
simultaneous usage models, but most are single-user, single-copy. OverDrive also
contains e-audiobook content, which is playable directly within the app and
cloud-based, so playback is synced across devices signed into the same account. At
the end of the check-out period, the ﬁle (whether e-book or e-audiobook) simply
326
B. Havens and J. Rosenfeld

expires from the patron’s device. There are no overdue ﬁnes for patrons, either! [66]
Other vendors have also gotten involved in e-book and e-audiobook content.
Notably, Axis 360 from Baker and Taylor (a company that started out as a book
distributor), 3M Cloud Library, and RBDigital (from Recorded Books).
Books and audiobooks have long been a major brand of the library, but libraries
have also begun to offer their patrons electronic access to movies, television shows,
music, and popular magazines. Some of this content is downloadable, like music
from Freegal. Freegal allows users to download a limited number of songs per week
from Sony Music Entertainment and other labels with which they have made
agreements. While copyright laws always apply, these downloads are DRM-free
and can be played as mp3 ﬁles on any device and do not expire [67].
Zinio, a partnership with Recorded Books, (yet another traditional audiobook
vendor!) is a service that provides downloadable popular magazines to mobile
devices and tablets. It also has its own marketplace (which exists for a fee com-
pletely outside of libraries) to provide magazine subscribers access to an electronic
copy of their subscriptions via the Zinio app. In May of 2012, they launched a
digital magazine newsstand to libraries. Libraries can choose from a catalog of over
5500 titles in over 20 languages to make available to patrons. There are no limits for
patrons, and ﬁles do not expire. They can remain on a patron’s device indeﬁnitely.
Libraries pay a tiered platform fee based on annual circulations as well as by title
selected. Library Journal gave a 2012 price point of $6417 per year paid by the
Chattanooga Public Library for access to 121 titles and the cost of the platform.
Patrons read the magazines in the Zinio app, which provides high-deﬁnition,
full-color pictures and interactive media elements [68]. The Zinio interface on a
library’s website is shown in Fig. 12.11.
Public libraries have also begun to provide access to streaming content, which
circumvents long ﬁle download times. Hoopla, a streamingservice started byMidwest
Tapes (which was also a traditional audiobook vendor), offers patrons access to
streaming movies, television shows, music, and audiobooks. Libraries pay very little
up front to use the service—instead offering the content to their patrons via their
website or the Hoopla app. They can then choose to throttle usage to keep within their
budget requirements. This may mean that popular titles are only available to the ﬁrst X
number of patrons wanting to access them per day. Subsequent patrons are told that the
limit has been reached for the day, but to try back tomorrow. There are no wait lists.
Libraries can also choose the loan period for all items [69]. Other streaming services
include IndieFlix (for movies), Freegal, and OverDrive (which have both recently
entered the streaming movie and television market),
While academic libraries do not usually offer such services to their patrons, stu-
dents and faculty often need access to information not immediately owned or leased
(in the case of database content) by their library. Traditional interlibrary loan has
always been onoffer, but it can take days (for journal articles), up to weeksfor books or
videos to be shipped to the borrowing library. For students with a paper due at
midnight, that is just not a viable option! In the early 2000s, libraries tried to adapt to
patron needs by initiating just-in-time purchases from interlibrary loan requests.
Libraries can purchase materials directly from several vendors (Better World Books,
12
Toward Seamless Access: Libraries from Alexandria Through the Digital Age
327

Alibris) directly within their interlibrary loan requesting modules. In this way, what
began as an interlibrary loan request results in a fast purchase. When the item arrives,
libraries may forego the usual processing (cataloging, covering the book, entering it
into their ILS) and only do so when the book is returned by the requesting patron.
This model evolved even further. What is now termed patron-driven acquisition
(PDA) has been applied most frequently to building e-book collections. This refers,
in its simplest form, to the process of allowing library user requests and information
seeking behavior to decide, in part, which materials the library acquires. Several
vendors (Ebrary, eBooks on EBSCOhost, and E-book Library) now offer mecha-
nisms for patron-driven acquisition. Libraries set up a proﬁle with the vendor based
on the subjects, publishers, dates of publication, cost of items, authors, keywords,
or a variety of other criteria for ﬁltering the types of items that they would like to
make available to their patrons. This results in a pool of possible items. Libraries do
not purchase or pay for these items up front. In fact, outside of a vendor platform or
hosting fee, this is otherwise free for libraries to set up. Depending on their pref-
erences, libraries can request MARC records for this pool of items so that they can
be added to their library catalog. Some libraries may choose not to do this and
rather to make these titles available through a search interface provided by the
vendor (in much the same way a patron would search a database). However, in this
age of discovery, that is generally not seen as a best practice. In order to expose
Fig. 12.11 Zinio interface on a public library’s website
328
B. Havens and J. Rosenfeld

patrons to the entire pool of potential items, it is ideal to load them into the library
catalog—dramatically enhancing visibility. For libraries using next-gen catalogs
(like OCLC’s WMS or Ex Libris’ Alma) or a discovery layer, these records can be
“turned on” as part of e-resource management. When patrons search in these
interfaces, results of items from the PDA pool are returned and appear to be owned
by the library. Patrons can click and directly access the content.
Libraries are then only charged when patrons use the items in the PDA pool.
This usage is triggered by differing thresholds based on vendor, but is usually along
the lines of when browsing exceeds 5 or 10 min or when a patron attempts to
download or copy and paste content from the e-book. Performing any of these tasks
can either trigger an outright purchase of the title, or, if libraries choose, this
triggers a “short term loan” (STL) of a time period deﬁned by the library (generally
1 or 7 days). After a certain library-deﬁned number of STLs, a purchase of the
e-book is triggered. The STL fees are not applied towards the purchase cost of the
e-book. The purchase is at the full price. The library is billed for short term loans at
a ﬁxed percentage cost of the list price of the e-book. This percentage varies from
vendor to vendor, but it is always less than the cost of purchasing the book.
Recently, publishers (e.g., Taylor and Francis, Bloomsbury, Oxford University
Press, Wiley, McGraw Hill, among others) have been raising short term loan prices,
as they feel the STL model is not a viable one for them (largely due to the fact that
libraries can decide how many short term loans can occur before a purchase is
triggered). In the past, some STL prices were as low as 5 % of the list price of the
book for a day’s usage. Some libraries were allowing 4 or 5 or more STLs before
triggering an auto purchase of an e-book. Essentially, this meant they were per-
petually renting books and buying very few titles outright. This is an area which has
been generating much discussion among librarians. To accommodate libraries that
object to the higher prices on STLs, some e-book vendors have put settings in place
on their platforms to allow librarians to no longer allow STLs from any publisher
charging more than a particular percentage of the list price for an STL. Libraries
may also choose to trigger an auto purchase of an e-book sooner or to exclude
particular publishers from their PDA program completely. Perhaps it is only when a
critical mass of libraries take this more drastic step that publishers will rethink the
viability of their current pricing models [70].
Libraries can also implement this PDA model with streaming video. Kanopy,
originally an Australian DVD distribution service, offers this. Libraries can license
individual titles or collections from particular producers and distributors as well, but
their PDA model is a new one in the library market. Four views of a video (3 s
counts as one view) triggers a license purchase of a video. One and three-year
licenses are available [71]. In both the streaming video and e-book PDA models,
libraries may choose to put a set amount of money on deposit with a vendor and run
their PDA program until it is exhausted or pay as they go. Libraries may choose to
mediate the PDA process (where patrons must request access) or let it go
unmediated (the more popular choice). Best practices generally state that patrons
should not be made aware that a PDA model is in place, as libraries want patrons to
access and use the materials they need without thinking about how much that usage
12
Toward Seamless Access: Libraries from Alexandria Through the Digital Age
329

might be costing their library, which might cause patrons to alter their
information-seeking behavior. Overall, patron-driven acquisition allows libraries to
make a much larger pool of items visible and available to their users without having
to pay up front or provide shelf-space. Also, the thinking is that if patrons choose
the items, perhaps they will be utilized more than items selected solely by librarians
or approval plans.
Academic library patrons also need rapid access to journal articles to which their
library may not have access. The Copyright Clearance Center (the organization
responsible for collecting payments from libraries for interlibrary loan usage of
unsubscribed titles and which generally manages licensing of content) provides a
Get it Now service [72]. This service can be integrated with a library’s OpenURL
resolver or existing ILL workﬂow. Just like PDA for e-books and streaming video,
it can be offered either mediated (much like interlibrary loan, but the article can be
delivered immediately upon processing) or unmediated (through the library’s
website). With Get it Now, the requesting library provides payment behind the
scenes to the Copyright Clearance Center that covers the cost of access and
copyright payments, and the article is delivered immediately to the patron. The
library has the ability to set up restrictions in advance (e.g., no patron may incur
more than a particular amount of costs via the service, only certain titles are
available, price limits per article, etc.), but the process runs invisibly to the end user.
Libraries pay less than the per-article cost charged by individual publishers on their
websites to access the content, so money is saved as well.
All of these new developments in library services and products continue to
change and expand rapidly. Librarians need to remain on the forefront of tech-
nology—knowledgeable about tools, products, and services that connect users with
information. Similarly, they need to serve as experts in how information is created,
evaluated, and disseminated. While books will most likely always be one of the
library’s most well-known brands [73], provision of access to electronic content is
at the true center of librarians’ work today.

Chapter 13
Privileged Information: The
Corporatization of Information
Frances Eames Noland
13.1
Information Literacy
Information Literacy can be deﬁned as a set of skills necessary to ﬁnd and evaluate
information and determine its accuracy, quality, and reliability. This includes
research abilities, logical evaluation of content, and background checking skills.
Throughout history, information literacy skills have been essential to the scholar
and the professional who wishes to not only absorb information, but to assess the
accuracy of this information. Studying information further, rather than taking it at
face value can greatly beneﬁt the reader, and train him or her to become a critical
thinker. This will encourage scholarly discourse, exploration of ideas, and sculpt the
reader’s ability to come to his or her own conclusions, instead of those reached by
the author of the piece. In this way, readers will become active in the research
process and create a dialogue with their peers and with the work itself.
In the rapidly changing digital world, information literacy becomes more
important than ever to evaluate credibility. As more and more sources become
readily available, the reader must learn to distinguish a quality source from a
falsiﬁed one. This is simply due to the prevalence of information, as opposed to an
overall diminishing quality of published materials. Since self-publication has
become popularized through the use of blogs and social media, as well as online
publication of print materials, the internet presents a vast network of opinions,
factoids, ﬁndings, hoaxes, and sometimes even leaked information. The Digital Age
brings with it an exciting array of new sources, previously unavailable to
researchers.

13.2
Privileged Information
Privileged Information is information that requires monetary compensation or some
type of credentials to access, or information that is restricted from the general
public. This is a result of the monetization of access to resources. There are three
information access levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary access infor-
mation is “equal access” information, resources that are readily available to the
public. Examples of these resources include wikis, websites, blogs, and search
engines. The next level is Secondary Access, which can also be described as “paid
access”. Secondary resources can be described as any form of information that
requires monetary compensation. Such resources include books, periodicals, ﬁlms,
and music. The ﬁnal level is Tertiary Access or “privileged information”, which
requires both money and credentials for access. These types of sources include
academic journals, scholarly databases, private libraries, and higher education
courses and course materials. Through the corporatization of information, this tiered
system was built, which beneﬁts the scholars and professionals at the tertiary level,
yet disadvantages those with access only to primary sources.
The Digital Age has drastically changed all three information access levels,
bringing with it the promise of a new age of research. Tertiary Access has been
greatly transformed by the Digital Age, where scholarly resources are now able to
be catalogued electronically. This allows for better user interaction with the
materials. Through the use of online academic search engines and databases,
scholars can ﬁnd more suitable sources that are applicable to their research topics.
Unlike their predecessors, the modern professor or student does not need to spend
lengthy hours poring over the library’s academic journals, searching for appropriate
sources. Instead, the modern scholar can use the search engines purchased by the
institution to more accurately locate the correct materials, as well as topics of
interest within those sources.
13.3
Librarians
Institutions often purchase a variety of specialized online databases to provide
students with easy access to information through the web, many offer remote
campus services that allow the student to conduct research outside of the library.
This type of solo research can be efﬁcient for quick references of materials, yet it
can also be much more of detriment to the user, stripping them of one of the most
essential components of the library: the librarian. As Janes [2] ponders, “If anybody
had proposed in 1990 that we open up libraries 24 hours a day and leave them
unstaffed for half or more of that time, that person would have been scorned, and
rightly so.” (p. 45). The remote access of library resources provides the scholar with
more ways in which to access a greater catalogue of information, but does not
provide the means in which to survey, interpret, and decode this information.
336

13.4
Digital Media
The Digital Age has also altered the way in which consumers interact with
Secondary Access information, making the resources more readily available to the
user, yet still monetizing them. This is being achieved through the use of multiple
platforms in which to access these materials, using devices such as computers,
tablets, smartphones, and smart watches, as well as through applications and remote
desktop functions. As Pavlik [4] details, “Digital media access and display devices
come in at least two basic forms: ﬁxed location and mobile.” (p. 37). Massive
archaic ﬁxed location devices such as the early televisions, radios, personal com-
puters, and even physical space libraries are locked in place, constraining the
consumer’s access to only the time they inhabit the particular space in which the
information is held. With the creation of the mobile device brings a new era of
freedom, liberating the consumer by allowing them to access materials anytime, and
anywhere. Pavlik discusses how mobile devices have enabled the industry of
electronic books. “These digital bookstores provide a collection of instantly
available full-text works that dwarfs even the largest brick-and-mortar sellers.”
(p. 146). This instant access makes the characteristics of the modern day Secondary
Access materials much like that of the Primary Access material, yet the clear
differentiation lies in the monetization of their access.
Behind this corporate branch out to electronic access lies the steady demand for
digital sales, rather than those of physical books, newspapers, DVDs, and CDs. The
key component of these consumer demands is the immediacy that digital media
provides. As Brock [1] reports, “In 1997, Japan’s extraordinarily successful and
economically resilient newspapers had recorded a total circulation of 53.8 million
copies. By 2011, this had fallen to 46.8 million.” (p. 208). This dramatic trans-
formation of the print industry can be seen not only in the methods in which the
information reaches the consumer, but in the actual information that is presented. In
the section entitled Error is Useful, Brock describes how the Digital Age has
changed American journalism beyond recognition. “The new journalism that has
ﬂourished in digital’s new possibilities is gossipy, unashamedly popular, and
heedless of the fact that many journalists would call it a ‘down market’.” (p. 219).
In this way, many Secondary Access sources have begun to lose credibility,
jeopardizing their long held superiority over Primary Access materials.
13.5
Total Information Awareness
The number of Primary Access materials have increased exponentially with each
year of technological innovation, bringing with it a new wealth of information
readily available to internet users everywhere. This new collection of internet based
resources contributes greatly to the vast library of information. These new Primary
Access materials are the lifeblood of the modern era of Total Information
13
Privileged Information: The Corporatization of Information
337

Awareness, and are beginning to compete with the Secondary and Tertiary
resources. As Lee [3] observes, “The industry led TIA is an evolving two-way
street. Facebook, Google, YouTube, Wikipedia, and even the controversial
WikiLeaks all collect information from everywhere and make it available to
everyone, whether they are individuals, businesses, or government agencies.”
(p. 189). This means of making access a public right is something that challenges
the very nature of information and privilege, bafﬂing the institutions that create,
distribute and monetize Secondary and Tertiary information. Although many
Primary Access sources and databases are credible and cite all sources, their rep-
utability is constantly questioned by institutions, which is cleverly disguised as
information literacy concerns. In library and research courses, these sources are
often generalized and stripped of any examples of Primary Access academic
materials, making the scholar dependent upon the corporatized information system.
If this information access gap is so disparate and obvious, how can it still exist?
The various levels have their justiﬁcations for the price they bare. Primary Access
information provides the advantage of equal access; yet due to the very nature of its
accessibility, it is corrupted by its inherent lack of reliability. The quality of Primary
Access materials is difﬁcult to assess in comparison to other types of information.
Secondary Access materials require a sum for a guarantee of renowned authors and
reliability, yet it restricts those who cannot afford the often rather inﬂated prices.
Tertiary Access information demands the highest price, and delivers the most
accuracy and reputable publishing institutions, yet the highest access level restricts
the information held within its pages from the vast majority of the population.
The dilemma of privileged information may eventually be addressed, but until
that time the rise of new sector of information will assist the general public in their
search for knowledge: Open Source. This type of information can be deﬁned as
content that would typically be restricted for Secondary and Tertiary Access only,
yet despite this has been released to the public in some capacity. Open Source
materials are often directly published by universities to increase interest in their
research, or even directly uploaded by authors to encourage young scholars to cite
their articles in their academic works. This system is a very effective one, providing
free resources in exchange for free publicity. In this way, not only do the readers
and consumers beneﬁt from the information, but the publishers and authors gain
further recognition for their works.
13.6
Digital Commons
Anyone with a thirst for knowledge, a need for information, or simply an interest in
a given topic should make use of these complimentary resources. Digital Commons
is one of the most comprehensive scholarly Open Source databases, covering a
plethora of topics throughout the ﬁelds of humanities, arts, social sciences, natural
sciences, engineering, mathematics, medicine, education, law, and business.
Through Digital Commons researchers can ﬁnd academic journal articles, theses,
338
F.E. Noland

dissertations, and books, published by universities for the beneﬁt of the public.
Another academic resource is Academia.edu, which not only provides scholarly
journal articles, but a unique interaction opportunity. Through Academia.edu stu-
dents can access articles directly from the authors of these works. This takes the
academic process a step further than reading, and creates an actual dialogue
between the reader and writer, giving the student a chance to converse with pro-
fessors and students from other educational institutions and private researchers.
As Lee [3] concludes, “Notwithstanding the potential risks and beneﬁts of
information sharing, two-way street of Total Information Awareness is the road that
leads to a more transparent and complete picture of ourselves, our governments, and
our world.” (p. 191). Equal access to information is vital to every individual across
the globe; this access will enable those without the monetary means or credentials
to attain knowledge through the archaic system of a bygone era. The Digital Age
brings the necessary tools for mass distribution and can enable this new age of
Equal Access. The argument that Primary Access materials have questionable
credibility will soon be an obsolete one, as the three access levels continue to
morph, eventually converging or disappearing altogether.

Communication and Language in the Age
of Digital Transformation
Tiana Sinclair
14.1
The Philosophy
Technology and futurism usually go hand-in-hand. In consumer electronics the
need to innovate is more necessary than ever. Manufactures now simply cannot be
certain that a given platform or device will dominate the industry for longer than a
few years before something else comes round [1]. While futurism includes not
simply the future of gadgets, the ﬁeld found itself pushing away some of the
perceived “softer” elements of foresight: social change, family structures, cultural
impacts—in favour of mathematical modelling and technology.
This chapter will explore the simple yet difﬁcult phenomenon of communication.
How do we communicate in the age of rapid technological shift? And with the
increase in labour automation rates how do we communicate to machines more
effectively?
Let’s start with looking at the semantic underlining of the concept of information
—how we perceive it, store it and communicate it to others.
14.2
Information
Abstractly, information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty. In the
case of communication of information over a noisy channel, this abstract concept
was made concrete in 1948 by Claude Shannon in A Mathematical Theory of
Communication [2], in which “information” is thought of as a set of possible

messages, where the goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel, and then
to have the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error, in spite
of the channel noise. Its impact has been crucial to the success of the Voyager
missions to deep space, the invention of the compact disc, the feasibility of mobile
phones, the development of the Internet, the study of linguistics and of human
perception, the understanding of black holes, and numerous other ﬁelds.
14.3
The Unspeakable Level
Language is one of the most efﬁcient forms of person to person communication.
However, it can be argued that we live our lives on unspeakable level and use the
language to help us process what’s happening around us, identify it, reﬂect on that
and share the experience with others.
Any map or language to be of maximum usefulness if in structure it was similar
to the structure of the empirical world. Likewise from the point of view of the
theory of sanity [3] any system or language should in structure be similar to the
structure of our nervous system. Language is a fundamental psychophysiological
function of a man, scientiﬁc investigation of a man in all his activities.
Empirical evidence suggests that different man-made verbal systems can stim-
ulate or hamper the functioning of human nervous system. The language of the new
standard must explore the relationship between the actual objects outside our skin
and our personal feelings inside— so the only link between the objective and the
verbal is structural. Structure can be considered as a complex of relations, and
ultimately as multi-dimensional order. Meaning of the word depends on meaning of
the words used to describe it.
The world is made of language, and sometimes this can be unreliable. The
numeral 2 only means something because it is not 1 or 3. House only exists because
it isn’t a boat or a street. I am only me because I am not someone else.
The whole system of existence is a closed system ﬂoating on nothing, like a locked
hovercraft [4].
The duality in the neurorepresentation and cognitive organisation of language
holds key interest to scientists [5] Our lives are lived on objective, un-speakable
levels, not on verbal levels. In order to necessitate a fundamental revision of the
structure of language, a semantic factor the language of four-dimensional structure
needs to be introduced. Humans are different from other species because of the
time-binding factor (which means that the new generation can roughly start off
where previous left off).
Alfred Korzybski outlines our need to create a language embracing all the
functions—verbal communication, mathematics, science, mental health. Language
represents inherent psychophysiological function of human organism that has been
neglected for so long. However building of such system is beyond the power of
a single man to complete and needs to be addressed by a wider community.
342

We are ruled even more, and even less consciously, by the inventors of the wheel, the plow,
the alphabet, even the Roman roads [6].
Wilson [6] argues that nervous adjustment of invoking generations that are being
forced to develop under unnatural for man semantic conditions imposed on them
produces leaders with old animalistic limitations. He describes it as a feature of bio-
survival circuit where we all have to work hard and hunt for our food tickets with
the only exception that now it mostly happens virtually. This is also the reason
behind our neurotic behaviour when we don’t get a tweet or an email back.
Generally we do not use our nervous system properly and have not emerged
from a very primitive semantic stage of development in spite of our technical
achievements [3].
The ultimate goal is not only to sketch a scientiﬁc program for the future (like
Aristotle did) but to build a system which at least in structure is similar to the
structure of the known facts from all branches of knowledge. Many statements of
scientists still have to be translated into a special language in which structural issues
are made quite possible, divulging factors in semantic reactions.
All desirable human characteristics (including high ‘mentality’) have a deﬁnite
psychophysiological mechanism, easily understood and trained kind of like mas-
tering car driving or spelling. Can it be the next potential human language?
Some problems arise from there. The ﬁrst one is scientiﬁc as it requires a
revision of all systems. The second is a practical one given the time and effort
required to master the system. Currently there are already some methodologies that
overlook this. Neurolinguistic programming, for instance, is a method of
inﬂuencing brain behaviour through the use of language and other types of com-
munication to enable a person to “recode” the way the brain responds to stimuli and
manifest new and better behaviours.
14.4
Logic of Paradox
In the early 80s the urgent need to develop the extremely complex mathematical
structure of the Uniﬁed Relativity and Quantum Theory (URQT) and to solve its
equations resulted in the idea of an artiﬁcial (constructed, engineered) universal
language. This language was supposed to be a theoretical language like mathe-
matics, a theory of the ﬁeld described by the language, but in addition it was meant
to be a real spoken language to make learning it and using it really easy even from
early childhood, ideally from birth [7].
It was decided not to use formal predicate logic as a basis for the new language
like it was done for well known constructed language loglan or its modiﬁed version
lojban [8]. Instead, the most effective tool of modern theoretical physics was used
for the foundation of this new language: symmetry group theory. Symmetry was
taken in it's fundamental form as the symmetry of oppositions.
14
Communication and Language in the Age of Digital Transformation
343

The symmetry of oppositions is known in traditional philosophy under the name
of dialectics which was popularised by Hegel. Dialectics can be described as the
practice of arriving at the truth by the exchange of logical arguments or, in theory
“means of extracting the truth” [9]. Dialectics is widely used in natural human
languages and is also relatively easy to comprehend. The only problem with the
logic of oppositions is that when followed to the very end at each logical point it
inevitably leads to paradoxes. In fact traditional dialectics as a way of thinking may
be called the “logic of the paradox” because it seemingly contains paradoxes at any
given level.
It was quickly realised that paradoxes did not simply represent some kind of
bizarre ﬂaw in the theory, but that they were actually powerful “points of singu-
larity” giving rise to new ideas and innovative solutions represented by the means
of a new language. Later it was understood that paradoxes served also as funda-
mental generative rules for the fractal structure of the constructed language and all
of its forms.
After the fundamentals of the new language were formulated, together, the group
of young physicists developed the body of the language. In homage to its dialectic
roots, the new language was named Dial [8]. This language wasn’t popularised and
is no longer in use however there are studies that claim there is an evidence
showing the change in brain's neuroplasticity throughout the tests, especially with
the younger segment of people. Very little is known about the history of the
language and its destiny remains unknown.

14.5
Artiﬁcial Languages
We as humanity developed many languages to communicate our ideas to the
machine. There’s C++, Ruby, Javascript to name a few. Essentially computers talk
to each other just like we do. In the last decade a lot of research has been done into
the study of Human Computer Interfaces—how to communicate to machines more
efﬁciently. What’s interesting is that on the front end it still has a linguistic input
channel but is there a way to exchange information a little more efﬁciently than in
English, Spanish or Chinese? And how do we make them solve the problems more
efﬁciently?
For instance, TRIZ (theory of the resolution of invention-related tasks) [10]
developed by the inventor and science-ﬁction author Genrich Altshuller points to
the need to produce a theory which deﬁnes generalisable patterns in the nature of
inventive solutions and the distinguishing characteristics of the problems that these
inventions have overcome.
The graph below summarises its principles.
Problem requires an inventive solution if there is an unresolved contradiction in
the sense that improving one parameter impacts negatively on another. He later
called these “technical contradictions”. The full list of contradictions can be viewed
in a TRIZ Matrix [11].

Just like the physical attributes of object are subjects to the certain laws of
co-relations, the physical and metaphysical has also been observed to display similar
patterns. For instance, the subject named synergetics explores small actions affecting
big systems. The term was coined by Buckminster Fuller who has attempted to deﬁne
its scope in his two volume work Synergetics [12]. It remains an iconoclastic subject
ignored by most traditional curricula and academic departments because of its
complex nature—it is in fact a so-called aggregator of variables rather than the study
itself. All of the exact sciences of physics and chemistry have provided for the
accounting of the physical behaviours of matter and energy only through separate,
unique languages that require awkward translation through the function of the
abstract interpreters known as the constants. But synergetics embraces the compre-
hensive family of behavioral relationships within one language capable of recon-
ciling all the experimentally disclosed values including Einstein’s energy equation,
Euler’s topology of points, areas, and lines, Kepler’s third law, Newton’s theory of
gravity, Thermodynamic laws as well as various studies of philosophical nature.
Based on these concepts what may the search engine of the future be like?
People might be using ‘search’ to discover structural relations. Already there are
alternative search engines like Wolfram|Alpha [13] that question the way we look
for answers on the web. They might understand and interpret what’s going on
346
T. Sinclair

around them fully and have healthy semantic relations. Mankind might become a
truly a time-binding nation: we will master ways to pass information to our heirs
instantly so they could build up on our knowledge, however have a full free will set
in place to discover their own doctrines.
Quantum computers will be much smarter than us. They will be ambiguous and
explorative and both will be capable of probable and possible behaviour [14].
When we are born at what point do we start learning about the world and
identifying ourselves and everyone around? Are we conscious at that point or does
it come with exposure to culture such as language, sciences, humanities?
An interesting case study was presented by FreeSpeech technologies team who
are currently working with autistic children to help them communicate more efﬁ-
ciently [15]. Narayanan turns our attention the word ‘soup’ being represented by an
abstract sketch as well as more arbitrary word that stands for ‘soup’. Children with
autism ﬁnd it very hard to grasp the contextual relations between the word and the
image it represents so simpliﬁcations were made to address this gap.
14
Communication and Language in the Age of Digital Transformation
347

Essentially, FreeSpeech technology represents sentences without language
which means you can start constructing a concept from anywhere in the sentence.
Also, if the user isn’t an English speaker their map would actually hold true in any
language. So long as the questions are standardised, the map is actually independent
of language.
It can be argued that in the future the methodology behind FreeSpeech could
help create a “universal language translator“ (like the one in Star Trek) to translate
any unknown languages.
14.6
The Internet of the Brain
Our brain is constantly proving or disproving the facts. The reality unfolds in front
of us as it’s being observed. Now let’s take a look at the information on the internet
—how difﬁcult it really is to fake a person, an idea? Technology might be time
proof but its not idiot-proof or troll-proof and the mediums of information storage
are erasable and fragile. What sort of content are we expected to get from people?
On the Internet we have power of the situations where we would otherwise feel
powerless. The tech-utopians present it as the new kind of democracy but it isn’t. It
locks people off in the world they’ve started with and prevents them for ﬁnding
anything different [16].
In the age of digital deception how relevant the phrase “nothing is real until it is
observed” really is? The programmes like Catﬁsh explore the dark side of identity
manipulation. Where to draw a line between little lies on ones CV and pretending to
be someone completely different on the internet?
If this theory would prove to be correct it would follow that we can exist
digitally by running ourselves as simulations. And this is what’s knows as com-
putational hypothesis of the brain [17].
Technology becoming more and connected with our bodies. So what has
changed? Digital immortality (or “virtual immortality”) is the hypothetical concept
of storing (or transferring) a person’s personality in more durable media, i.e., a
computer, and allowing it to communicate with people in the future. The result
might look like an avatar behaving, reacting, and thinking like a person on the basis
of that person’s digital archive. After the death of the individual, this avatar could
remain static or continue to learn and develop autonomously. A considerable
portion of transhumanists and singularitarians place great hope into the belief that
they may become immortal by the year 2045, by creating one or many
non-biological functional copies of their brains, thereby leaving their “biological
shell”. These copies may then “live eternally” in a version of digital “heaven” or
paradise.
Already scientists suggest that by linking the brains together, they could create
Brainets—a system of brains attached together to make an “organic computer” [18].
The language as a mean for communication may be up for the review in that case as
well as our psyche mechanisms. As the amount of our daily information intake
348
T. Sinclair

increases we can see an increase in mental health issues which will need to be
addressed in the near-distant future.
By the end of the day what is the purpose of technology? Is it there to highlight
our pre-enlightment era habits, are we using Facebook to claim our Rewards of the
Tribe [19] due to our need to seek social validation? Are we there to ‘burn the
witches’ and publicly shame [16] the people we don’t necessary agree with? Are the
app icons with animal icons acting as a symbolism for digital neo-paganism coming
back to show us to worship the new gods of the Internet era?
In the same way computer software can run on a different hardware maybe the
software of the mind can run on other platforms. Are we connected so much that at
times it feels like we want to disconnect for a while? What is awareness? Does to
know mean to be aware? And how do we accept or reject information that later
forms our knowledge base? All these questions remain unanswered.
Language is an instrument of thought. It must concisely and correctly display
and simulate reality. Daniel Webster said this: “If all of my possessions were taken
from me with one exception, I would choose to keep the power of communication,
for with it, I would regain all the rest.”

Tree of Ennoblement
All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree. All these aspirations are
directed toward ennobling man’s life, lifting it from the sphere of mere physical
existence and leading the individual towards freedom. It is no mere chance that our
older universities developed from clerical schools. Both churches and universities—
insofar as they live up to their true function—serve the ennoblement of the
individual.
—Albert Einstein
We don’t read and write poetry because it’s cute. We read and write poetry because
we are members of the human race. And the human race is ﬁlled with passion. And
medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to
sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.
—Dead Poets Society

“How”—The Key to Knowledge-Building
Pedagogy Success in Supporting Paradigm
Shifts for Student Growth and the 4Cs
of Future Education
Sandra Lund-Diaz, Mireia Montane and Penelope Beery
15.1
Introduction
Over the past few decades, societies have transitioned from being industrialized and
existing in isolation to being globally-entwined and based in knowledge.
Classrooms have been transformed from factory-era teaching to a different type of
learning for the Knowledge Age, where ideas are the main source of economic
growth. The future of education is here today, where new pedagogies are needed to
facilitate real-world learning, where students are able to acquire skills and com-
petencies they need to achieve academic success, and where educators can become
coaches and facilitators of learning AND co-learners rather than simply deliverers
of pre-determined content. Knowledge Building is manifested in different types of
classroom-based learning, primarily in student engagement, where content is con-
textualized and a curriculum is based in phenomenon learning, or “teaching by
topic”. It incorporates technology with methodologies that allow learners to interact
with the content of classroom instruction in a deep and thoughtful manner through
an interdisciplinary approach. Students and teachers alike are co-learning, gaining
knowledge from the experiences of others to achieve their learning objectives
around the production and continual improvement of ideas. Knowledge-building
classrooms create opportunities for students to acquire 21st Century skills that
support real-world problem-solving, related to so-called STEM skills, particularly
analytical skills and the scientiﬁc method. We refer to these skills as the “4Cs of
Future Education”—Critical thinking ∙Collaboration ∙Communication ∙
Creativity—that will prepare students for success throughout the education con-
tinuum. These skills will also contribute to their preparation as engaged citizens and
as productive workers in an era of volatile economies with surging unemployment

and under-employment, particularly among young adults, and a rapidly changing,
globalized labor market.
The Alternative Learning and Teaching Ecosystem (ALTE) is a model for the
4Cs of Future Education mimicking education systems in countries consistently
ranking high on skills assessments that have successfully reimaged learning and
teaching. ALTE blends knowledge-building pedagogy and teacher training while
promoting UNESCO information and communication technologies (ICT) compe-
tency framework for teaching (CFT) as well as OECD standards. The ICT CFT
supports a teacher’s development in Technology Literacy for more efﬁcient learn-
ing, Knowledge Deepening that enables students to acquire in-depth knowledge of
their school subjects and apply it to complex, real-world problems, and Knowledge
Creation, enabling students, citizens and the workforce they become, to create the
new knowledge required for more harmonious, fulﬁlling and prosperous societies.
The ALTE model was built on knowledge-building principles with methodologies
speciﬁcally developed to support these three approaches to 21st Century education.
Across time, men and women have accomplished great feats that did not seem
possible in their wildest imagination… building the great pyramids by positioning
stones seemingly impossible to move; discovering far-ﬂung lands despite the
common-held belief that the world was ﬂat; man taking ﬂight, reaching for the stars
and landing on the moon. These are just a few examples of feats accomplished in
spite of what many thought were insurmountable challenges. They required cour-
age, persistence and faith, accompanied by a single-syllable word…“HOW?”,
propelling these accomplishments into our human history. By answering “How?”,
mankind pursues solutions to problems and situations of great consequence to all
the peoples of the world, continually amazing disbelievers. Answering “How?”
accomplishes what many thought to be impossible, and the impossible not only
becomes possible but common place. “How?” withstands the testament of time and
continues to provoke the innovation, ingenuity and creativity of those who dare to
dream of accomplishing something great. And contemplating “How?” is the key to
knowledge-building success.
15.2
A Model for the 4Cs of Future Education
Knowledge Building exploits those same traits—scientiﬁc curiosity, ingenuity,
innovation and creativity—that supported the greatest discoveries of mankind as
opportunities to engage students in interactive learning, beginning at a young age.
These students will one day become our future scientists, educators, workforce and
leaders, and through knowledge building they acquire critical skills that will prepare
them for success in school, and later in life. These are the 21st Century skills that
support real-world problem-solving, related to so-called STEM skills, particularly
analytical skills and the scientiﬁc method. We refer to these skills as the “4Cs of
Future Education”—Critical thinking ∙Collaboration ∙Communication ∙Creativity
—that will prepare students for success throughout the education continuum. These
354
S. Lund-Diaz et al.

are the skills that will also contribute to their preparation as engaged citizens and
productive workers in an era of volatile economies with surging unemployment and
under-employment, particularly among young adults, and a rapidly changing,
globalized labor market.
The 4Cs of Future Education are integral to Knowledge Building, which also
supports deep learning through which students will develop a set of competencies
to master the subject matters of their curriculum and instruction. They are able to
understand academic content and apply their knowledge to problem-solving by
engaging the 4Cs: thinking critically, working collaboratively, communicating
effectively in the classroom, and applying creativity to come up with innovative
solutions to the problems of the world. After all, the ability to imagine, create or
discover should not fade as a person grows; rather it should be nurtured and
strengthened before students are crippled by the norms of an industrial-era edu-
cation system that is currently mainstream for learning and teaching. With the 4Cs,
students will also develop academic mindsets for the classroom as well as for a job
later in life. The 4Cs prepare students to achieve at high levels and gain mastery of
core academic content, whether in traditional subjects or in interdisciplinary ﬁelds
that merge several key ﬁelds of study. It is here that knowledge-building pedagogy
and methodologies are most effective, giving the students tools to ask the right
question to effective learning—HOW?
In creating an effective model for the 4Cs of Future Education, we looked at
several education systems and focused on countries consistently at the top of in-
ternational rankings of learning assessments such as PISA (Program for
International Student Assessment) regarding reading, mathematics, and science
literacy. We found that they had built high-quality pathways to learning for their
children in primary and secondary education by rethinking teaching and learning
[1]. They had drastically changed their education methods to introduce a curricu-
lum based around phenomenon learning. This is where subject-speciﬁc lessons in
core
subjects
such
as
Geography,
History,
Math,
Economics,
Biology,
Earth Sciences and others become interdisciplinary studies through project-based
learning aligned to standards. In phenomenon learning, students are taught
cross-subject topics, such as climactic change, sustainability, nutrition, and eco-
nomic trading zones that incorporate multi-disciplinary content from traditional
subjects to answer the question, HOW?. This is the phenomenon learning of those
model education systems, and the effective use of technology for content delivery
and the continued professional development of their educators is key to success.
These models also reimagine learning, where the format of the traditional, more
passive approach to learning is replaced by a more collaborative method of
learning. Instead of sitting and listening to the teacher standing in the front of the
classroom, students are encouraged to work together to discuss and solve problems in
a collaborative small-group learning environment as co-learners, led by the teacher
who becomes a facilitator of learning rather than a transmitter of pre-determined
content. We based our model for the 4Cs of Future Education, the Alternative
Learning and Teaching Ecosystem (ALTE), on lessons learned from the phenomenon
learning of those countries that have successfully reimaged learning and teaching.

ALTE blends knowledge-building pedagogy and teacher training, mimicking those
high-quality education systems by supporting the following elements:
• Computer-supported collaborative learning around topics through the use of
education technology developed speciﬁcally to support the highly-researched
principles of knowledge-building pedagogy [2];
• Teacher training in the use of education technology developed to support col-
laborative learning around topics through a multi-disciplinary approach while
promoting proﬁciency in information and communication technologies and
UNESCO’s competency framework for teaching [3];
• Bringing education technology into the classroom and utilizing embedded
assessment tools to track student growth and conduct formative and summative
assessments in real time;
• Partnering classrooms world-wide to build relationships between students and
between educators, including teachers, principals and technology staff.
15.3
Contextualization and Personalized Learning
ALTE encourages learning from a reality-centered point of view around ideas.
Theme-based learning and exploration, coupled with activities based on real issues
applicable to everyday life, convert the classroom into living labs, engaging
teachers and students alike in personalized, meaningful learning. They examine the
issues at hand through the HOW? lens, applying the 4Cs of Future Education in a
methodical, systematic approach based on scaffolding. The results: a multi-
disciplinary perspective to improve student growth and academic achievement
through deep learning, supporting mastery of core academic content, and building
skills critical to academic and professional success in the 21st Century.
CASE STUDY:  A Multidisciplinary Approach to Studying Math…..
Welcome to the ninth grade math class of Mr. Hamilton, working 
with his students asking HOW they can improve the long jump for 
an upcoming sports competition. Students create digital media that 
trace their practice sessions, and by watching their videotaped 
performances in long-jump trials and comparing their performance 
to grids and charts, students study important math and physics 
concepts - angles, momentum and distance. But they also study 
physiology and begin to understand how muscles work, and human 
health topics where they also learn how nutrition and adequate sleep
contribute toward the formation and maintenance of healthy 
muscles.
Students work together in small groups to share their ideas on how 
to improve their long jump and increase their distance. They do 
research on the different subjects incorporated into what started as a 
math class transformed into a multi-disciplinary study of subject 
matters relevant to their lives. 
356
S. Lund-Diaz et al.

This case study demonstrates an important aspect of the ALTE Model—per-
sonalized relevance of the subject matter being studied. Mr. Hamilton’s students are
motivated to learn because they are studying THEIR muscles, THEIR performance
and unlocking THEIR potential. Another important aspect to consider—how
engagement in hands-on activities changes not only the student but the teacher as
well. Case in point: many of the students in Mr. Hamilton’s class volunteer to
become peer tutors to work alongside their teacher, to produce digital media that
reﬂect the curriculum and standards that high school students are expected to
master. Mr. Hamilton taps into his own creative potential by overseeing the pro-
duction of content tailored to his student population. Under the status quo of
teaching, mathematics teachers are expected to be content conveyors, following
pre-deﬁned curriculum in preparation for accountability tests; they are not expected
to be creative in producing content or products. However, by producing these video
presentations of students performing long jumps, Mr. Hamilton becomes an
effective, creative agent at the complex intersection of navigating mathematical
content and student cognition.
This multidisciplinary approach to learning complementary areas of studies has a
direct impact on the focused subject matter or discipline. As in the case study of Mr.
Hamilton’s math class, not only do these group exercises allow the entire class to
master the math concepts and content being studied, but they also learn comple-
mentary aspects of biology, physics and life sciences, thereby acquiring a deeper
understanding of the subject matter and performing better on tests. This
multi-disciplinary, multi-media student-driven approach is ideal for closing the
achievement gap for students with learning difﬁculties, moving learning away from
being literature driven and into a realm the student can easily grasp, which also
serves English language learners well. It also taps into personalized learning, where
the knowledge-building pedagogy on which ALTE is based tailors the learning
experience to meet different needs of the students in small group learning envi-
ronments. And when teachers from other subject matters interact with students they
may not normally have contact with, the learning is enriched through an
inter-disciplinary approach. This interaction can come from a teacher across the hall
or around the world.
The ALTE computer-supported collaborative learning paradigm promotes dis-
course around ideas, with learning based on collaborative problem-solving rather
than memorization. The use of ICTs and specialized knowledgeware support the
constructive use of authoritative information in acquiring knowledge around a
theme. Students learning in knowledge-building learning environments not only
develop competencies and increased literacy skills because they are constantly
reading and writing, but also come to see themselves and their work as part of a
society-wide effort to advance knowledge frontiers. They are able to create new
15
How”—The Key to Knowledge-Building Pedagogy Success …
357

knowledge from the workings of the group for applications in a global community.
When students work collaboratively on revolving their studies and research around
a common theme, they are able to apply the “act locally/think globally” philosophy
to turn local issues into global issues, again taking a multi-disciplinary approach to
studying different subject matters. By partnering with other classrooms around the
globe, an international exposure is brought to the work students do on building
knowledge around problems affecting their community.
Knowledge Building in Action [4] is the umbrella 501(c)(3) nonproﬁt organi-
zation providing the infrastructure for ALTE. During past school cycles, it facili-
tated the participation of U.S. classrooms in the Knowledge Building International
Project (KBIP), a successful multi-year international collaboration between class-
rooms and the COMConeixer project [5] (translated from Catalan into “building
knowledge together”) in Catalonia, Spain, on which ALTE is based. Teachers
selected water—which is of vital importance to everyone on this planet—as the
common theme of their inquiry-based collaborative learning. Educators in U.S.
classrooms participated in KBIP, where the ALTE module of teacher training and
student learning was incorporated into the curriculum. Ms. Anderson’s 6th grade
social studies at the 68th Street School in South-Central Los Angeles focused on
public sector efforts to supply clean water for their citizens and learned about the
importance of conserving water so that there would be a sufﬁcient supply for the
entire world; Ms. Erlington’s 6th grade social studies classes featured project-based
learning within the context of Knowledge Building, and students in Mr. Aviles’ 6th
grade math class studied a prototype water piano to listen to different sounds based
on water volume and density. Ms. Morales’ 8th grade history class at the Lou
Dantzler Middle School, also in Los Angeles, explored how great civilizations were
formed around water sources and the conquest of societies made possible by
navigation on the seas and oceans. Mr. McKenna used the ALTE model for his
Project-Based Credit Recovery class of Special Education students at Malaga Cove
Academy in Palos Verdes, CA, studying history from a multi-disciplinary per-
spective. Mr. Crabtree engaged his 7th and 8th grade honors science students at
Rizzoli Academy for Gifted and Talented Students in Hartford, CT in exploring
scientiﬁc concepts, and Ms. Riad’s class of 9–11 year olds at Lake Trafford
Elementary School in Immokalee, FL, studied their core subjects of social studies
utilizing the ALTE Model to understand ocean currents and the Gulf Stream,
focusing on wide-spread effect of the Deepwater Horizons oil spill.
358
S. Lund-Diaz et al.

These U.S. teachers were slated to be partnered with their colleagues teaching
the same age groups and subject matters in other parts of the world, still focusing on
the common topic of water. These included teachers in Quebec and Toronto,
Canada; Barcelona and Tarragona, Spain; Helsinki, Finland; Bari, Italy; Oslo,
Norway; Porto and Lisbon, Portugal; Bogota, Colombia; Puebla, Mexico; and
Hong Kong. Teachers from these other countries were also studying the water topic
from both a local perspective as well as a global perspective. Several examples of
questions posed by the teachers to their students included: “Why are the ﬁsh dying
in the St. Lawrence River?” “How did an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico reach the
shores of Finland?” “What type of forests nourished with rainwater provide raw
material for the housing boom in China and how does pollution impact the cycle?”
“What is happening with global warming and sea levels rising?”
15.4
Promoting UNESCO’s Competency Framework
for Teaching
Student progress in the types of learning environments proposed by ALTE does not
happen naturally without facilitation. Teacher intervention is needed to coordinate the
small groups and mediate their interactions. Additionally, acknowledging the role of
15
How”—The Key to Knowledge-Building Pedagogy Success …
359

the teacher in raising a student’s achievement is of utmost importance. ALTE provides
initial training, ongoing mentoring and support for teachers to serve as leaders, moti-
vators and facilitators of learning while gaining proﬁciency in the use of technology in
the classroom. It also supports the interactions between principals, technology staff and
other faculty. An important objective of the teacher training component of ALTE is
partnering educators with their peers and colleagues for mentoring. The ALTE
Community of Practice facilitates virtual interactions, archived material, and an
exchange of information as well as ongoing professional development.
Another important objective of the ALTE Model refers to efforts that promote
UNESCO
information
and
communication
technologies
(ICT)
competency
framework for teaching (CFT). UNESCO’s ICT CFT supports standards that out-
line competencies that teachers need to master for student motivation, and the
teacher’s as well. The Framework is arranged in three successive stages of a tea-
cher’s development:
– Technology Literacy enables teachers to acquire competencies to incorporate
technology, learning materials and ICT equipment to inspire student motivation
to use ICTs in order to learn more efﬁciently.
– Knowledge Deepening enables students to acquire in-depth knowledge of their
school subjects through multi-disciplinary approaches to content mastery around
topics and apply it to complex, real-world problems.
– Knowledge Creation enables students, citizens and the workforce they become
to create the new knowledge required for more harmonious, fulﬁlling and
prosperous societies.
The ALTE model was built on knowledge-building principles with methodologies
speciﬁcally developed to support these three approaches to learning and teaching.
The model is a complete ecosystem consisting of knowledge-building pedagogy,
educational technology, teacher training, and tools for formative and summative
assessments of student growth, created speciﬁcally to support innovative approaches
to 21st Century education. Through ALTE, we are able to partner classrooms in K-12
learning environments (standard classrooms, after-school programs, Department of
Defense schools, alternative learning venues, international baccalaureate course-
work, etc.) anywhere there is broadband. The actual educational technology con-
sisting of the Knowledge Forum as an electronic workspace is also available for
implementation on local servers. The Knowledge Forum is a product of 25+ years of
research by an international network of educators and engineers [6], proven effective
in supporting students acquiring 21st Century skills, particularly the 4Cs of Future
Education and tools that help students ask the important questions of life.
360
S. Lund-Diaz et al.

15.5
Conclusions
The ALTE model supports 21st Century education through guided student research
within technology-rich collaborative environments for PreK-12 learning. The
model partners classrooms around the globe through the use of computers, multi-
media technology, the Internet and specialized educational technology known as
the “Knowledge Forum™”, an electronic workspace and platform that supports the
scaffolding processes of scientiﬁc inquiry and embedded applets to perform the
formative assessments needed to verify student growth [7]. The platform supports
Knowledge Building both in the creation of notes contributed by the students and in
the ways they are displayed, linked, and made objects of further work. Revisions,
elaborations, and reorganizations over time provide a record of group advances, like
the accumulation of research advances in a scholarly discipline. When notes (text,
graphics, multimedia, videos, etc.) are added to the Knowledge Forum’s database,
students are able to search existing notes, comment on other students’ notes, or
organize notes into more complex structures. As the database grows, the workspace
provides a progressive trace of how ideas have evolved in the class, and the
database helps to formally show and document the classroom community’s
knowledge advancement while helping students further advance their ideas.
Students build on each other’s notes by agreeing, asking and answering questions,
offering opinions, and establishing a culture of accepting individual difference.
Scaffolds allow users to add a theory about a problem and build-on or critique a
theory—of their own or of another member of their group. An endless improv-
ability of ideas is supported by the ability to create increasingly high-order con-
ceptual frameworks. It is always possible to reformulate problems at more complex
levels, create a rise-above note that encompasses previous rise-above notes, or to
create a more inclusive view-of-views. Notes and views can be revised at any time,
unlike most discussion environments that disallow changes after a note is posted.
Processes of peer review and new forms of publication engage students in group
editorial processes. Published works appear in a different visual form and searches
can be restricted to the published layer of a database. Analytic toolkits embedded in
the Knowledge Forum platform are used to assess social network patterns when we
are interested in collaboration dynamics, and vocabulary growth when we are
looking at concept attainment. Knowledge builders monitor their work, and engage
in self-assessment rather than being totally dependent on external evaluations.
These activities have a clear goal of co-creating new perspectives and advancing
knowledge beyond the limit of an individual. Numerous research ﬁndings show that
this approach, speciﬁcally the knowledge-building approach, induces motivation to
learning, improves learners’ higher order thinking (e.g. critical thinking, problem-
solving), and fosters personal development (e.g. communication skills, interpersonal
skills and lifelong learning attitudes). Through the ALTE model, they are able to
share knowledge and tackle projects that incorporate features of teamwork,
real-world content and the use of varied information sources, especially the use of
information technology to access authoritative sources. Activity is directed toward
15
How”—The Key to Knowledge-Building Pedagogy Success …
361

the need to educate students for a world in which knowledge creation and innovation
are pervasive. The production and continual improvement of ideas of value to the
“community”, in this case making reference to the community of students, are central
to Knowledge Building theory and philosophy. Learners are engaged in the full
process of knowledge creation as preparation for entering college and/or the work-
force. Every student is a contributor toward the collective knowledge of the group,
and the success of the student community depends on the careful cultivation of ideas
and the constant use and re-use of knowledge resources—cultivating skills and
natural inquisitiveness for the ability to ask the right questions, including “HOW”.

Educational Ergonomics and the Future

16.1
Designing Technology to Fit the Brain
Some parts of the brain handle some tasks better than others, just like some parts of
the body handle some tasks better than others. It’s possible to write with our feet,
but don’t you ﬁnd that it’s easier with your hands? And don’t most of us ﬁnd it
easier with one hand than the other? And once the best hand is found, don’t we ﬁnd
some writing utensils easier to use? And once the best utensil is found, have you
ever discovered a slightly better way to use it that makes it easier, or makes you
able to write faster or longer? So it is with learning, and that is Cognitive
Ergonomics.
For all the same reasons as our writing-hand preference, our brains’ experiences
gradually improve our skills. As infants, even in the womb, our experiences are
limited to those which directly impact our senses: temperature, sounds, touch, etc.
When we ﬁrst encounter language, most of us naturally begin to hear and imitate
the sounds of words, connect those words to their various meanings, and apply
them to contexts in grammar structures. Until this point, we have learned through
the mental channel most readily available, presented in this case through hearing
and speaking.
Spoken words are themselves auditory symbols in the form of sounds. As you
read this, you are interpreting sets of visual symbols in the form of typed letters that
represent auditory symbols. Upon learning this second symbol set, your brain
developed its ability to learn new information in different ways, auditorily or
visually, and paved the ﬁrst path to less ergonomic learning. Of course, that’s not to
say that learning through written symbols doesn’t occur: it’s occurring right now.
And it doesn’t mean that there aren’t efﬁciencies inherent to writing; written
communication has been incalculably valuable to human progress. But writing, as a

visual symbolic system that stands for an auditory symbolic system, requires more
regions of the brain to process information in ﬂuent succession without error. It
takes more work. It makes learning more complex. Of course; it’s a symbolic
system that stands for another symbolic system that points to something in the real
world.
Some types of learning encode information with even more complex layers. For
example, math uses numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.), symbols (+, −, x, /, etc.), and variables
(x, y, n, etc.) in addition to other rules that affect the order of operations, all of
which are translatable into spoken language and which seek to describe situations in
real or potential worlds. The symbols of math are even more encoded, requiring
even more regions of the brain to process information in ﬂuent succession without
error, taking more even more work, and making learning even more complex. And
with each new layer of complexity comes an even greater plurality of alternative
methods of representation: Whereas written language corresponds to spoken lan-
guage in a nearly one to one relationship, the symbol-rich language of math is prone
to vague written and spoken representation. For example:
“1” is equally meaningful when expressed as “1.0,” “1/1,” “100 %,” “one,” “ONE,”
or “One.”
And “1 + 1 = 2” can be expressed as:
“one and one are two”
“one and one equal two”
“one plus one equal two,” etc.
These verbal representations can be written in print or cursive, in uppercase,
lowercase, or mixed case.
Finally, consider how homophones can add to confusion: “one” and “won,” or
“two” “to” and “too”.
If you’re still not convinced, imagine that you are 7 years old and English isn’t
your native language. That’s the real situation for millions of students.
Language and math are but two examples forming a case for the value of
cognitively ergonomic educational design. Fundamentally, Cognitive Ergonomics
represents an opportunity to reframe our approach to education. Instead of starting
by selecting content and scheduling it for delivery, Cognitive Ergonomics analyzes
the very nature of the content and seeks to present it to the brain in the way the brain
is best equipped to receive it.
16.2
Digital Technology
Digital technology is the great game-changer. Past centuries relied on written text to
preserve and transfer information. “A picture is worth a thousand words” is no real
replacement for an actual picture. No amount of verbal description of Mona Lisa,
even a pixel by pixel color map, can do to the brain what the eyes perceive in a
364
Z.R. Tolan

moment. Similarly, no amount of verbal description can replicate the same learning
as one good hearing of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. And neither can musical art
describe visual art, or vice versa.
Most people agree that a student’s education is better served by ﬁeld trips to the
museum or the symphony than by reading about them in textbooks, but technology
offers additional potential to accommodate the nature of the human brain,
ergonomically, and efﬁciently. When it comes to learning, the brain can’t be
commanded: “LEARN!” Try as we might (and we certainly try!), learning is
something that happens as a result of exposure. Quite contrary to methods of force,
the brain is always alert to its surroundings in various degrees of conscious
awareness. Moreover, human sensory perceptions are limited. Instead of thinking of
the traditional Five Senses, which were originally proposed by Aristotle more than
2,000 years ago, modern science lists around 21 senses.1 For example, the sense
commonly called “touch” is more accurately parsed into pressure, pain, itch,
external heat and cold, and the body’s internal temperature, all of which are separate
systems.
Different senses have different educational applications, and as human society
develops, the applications continue to develop. The human sense of sound is able to
differentiate spoken language from a Mozart sonata from the growl of a bear, and
human vision can differentiate objects in immediate focus from our peripheral
vision, while still giving degrees of active and continuous conscious focus to them
all, simultaneously, and ceaselessly. Since applications of Cognitive Ergonomics
naturally leads to potential applications of Cognitive Efﬁciencies, we ought to
explore the range of human potential as it pertains to maximizing the use of new
educational technologies.
The brain craves stimulation; how much, what type, and at what pace is a matter
of personal taste (so to speak). Remove all sensory stimulation and the brain gets
bored. Enter a sensory-stimulating environment and without effort, learning
happens.
Not only can the brain process stimuli simultaneously, it does automatically and
it is difﬁcult or often impossible to restrain it from doing so. You may plug your
ears from the sounds around you, but try turning off your sense of warm or cold. To
paint the point in full color, recognize that right now (and at every conscious
moment) your brain is regulating your heart and lungs, detecting internal and
external temperatures, monitoring for pain, wavering between various states of
1(Names for senses vary) 1. Sight, 2. Taste (in 5 subcategories: 2.1: Sweet, 2.2: Salty, 2.3: Sour,
2.4: Bitter, 2.5: Umami) 3. Touch, Pressure, 4. Touch, Pain, 5. Touch, Itch, 6. Temperature,
External Heat and Cold, 7, Temperature, Internal Body Temperature, 8. Sound, 9. Smell (pos-
sessing, by some estimates, 388 different receptors), 10. Pain, Skin, 11. Pain, Bones and Joints, 12.

body to detect tension in places such as muscles) 15. Equilibrioception, 16. Stretch Receptors

Chemoreceptors (detects hormones and drugs), 18. Thirst, 19. Hunger, and the most controversial:
20. Magnetoception (ability to detect the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld) and, 21. Time.

hunger and thirst, seeing sights, hearing sounds, and smelling whatever wafts your
way—all without effort, and mostly without choice.
In the long history of organized education, information needed to be consoli-
dated and presented in linear fashion, usually through the medium of textbooks
guided by instructors. Some textbooks were designed to strategically double-dip
education by cross-pollinating subject matter. My favorite example is a Latin
curriculum2 used by one of Queen Elizabeth I’s private tutors, Roger Ascham,3
which doesn’t teach conversational Latin language, per se, so much as neatly
arranges vocabulary and grammar into chapters on aspects of ancient Roman and
contemporary English life, including topics such as geology, zoology, gastronomy,
et cetera. Therefore, students learning Latin simultaneously learned about aspects
of everyday life, such as uses for particular minerals. One might imagine a class-
room from Harry Potter’s Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where
students learned the names of enchantments and incantations, accompanied by
samples of original objects. Regardless of how the imagination runs, the only point
is that science education was grafted into Latin education, making each more
relevant to the other. At the heart of it is strategic curriculum design. If a 600 year
old textbook can do that, what can digital technology do?
If any reader takes away one thing from this essay, let it be that the brain is
magniﬁcently equipped to process multiple stimuli simultaneously—and it likes to
do so. Digital content can be prepared such that it inherently exposes multiple
subjects simultaneously: foreign language in music curricula, science in foreign
language curricula, architecture in art curricula, art in science curricula, and so
forth.
Let’s go a step further. From one example above, such as architecture in art
curricula, imagine that a student wants to reproduce a drawing of the Roman
Colosseum. If they are also studying Latin, why not label some of its parts in Latin?
Or if Italian, why not label in Italian? Both are relevant to the context of the
drawing, the student’s other coursework, and art education. If they aren’t learning a
language, what’s the harm in labeling pieces in Italian anyway? If they are learning
Chinese, even though Chinese is hardly the natural contextual milieu and even if
pieces of the Colosseum aren’t part of the student’s Chinese class vocabulary,
what’s the harm? But we don’t generally expect the art teacher to also know about
Architecture, Engineering, Latin, Italian, Chinese, and all the other courses that
could be taught in school… That would be prohibitive to hiring.
A digital educational system, however, informed of a student’s course of study,
could automatically populate information speciﬁc to the learning goals of the stu-
dent. And it can do all those other things computers are so much more naturally
suited to do, like long-term content management, perhaps in the form of tracking
the number of exposures a student has had to a particular piece of content, and in
what form (hearing, reading, speaking, etc.).

Such a system could also empower the student to turn on or off as few or many
simultaneous channels of information as they wish at any particular instant. Want
some background music with your Art/Engineering/Latin lesson? Choose a playlist
from last year’s band repertoire (review), from current year’s repertoire (exposure
for reinforcement), or preview next year’s repertoire (priming). Tired of band
music? Listen to what the orchestra played, is playing, or will play. Sick of the
symphony? How about music in Chinese, or anything else that’s available. Turn
labeling in foreign languages on or off, or for the enthusiastic linguist, turn on
multiple languages: Label in Latin, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Chinese if you
like. With extensive tools already built, like Google Translate, interdisciplinary
content integration is a mere matter of tagging and, more importantly, responding to
the opportunity.
Since the brain handles multiple forms of stimulation simultaneously, music can
play at the same time as foreign language is spoken (because of course, we must
hear the pronunciation of the native speaker), without risk of encountering cogni-
tive interference. From a neurological stance, content types must themselves be
tagged according to their nature, and rules must be programmed which assign
simultaneous compatibility, or place datum types in a sequential queue. For
example, visual datum and auditory datum are simultaneously compatible if the
visual datum is not audio/visual. So a drawing of the Colosseum can be accom-
panied by background music and spoken foreign language, unless the background
music contains lyrics relevant to their curriculum; if not, the music’s volume can
dip when relevant language is spoken.
That concludes the general overview of cognitively efﬁcient educational tech-
nology. In summary, its primary goal is to efﬁciently blend methods of group
instruction into a comprehensive and relatively easy-to-make educational platform
that empowers students to adjust their minute-by-minute cognitive load.
The following sections are for brave educational visionaries only. Instead of
blending technology with methods of group instruction, the digital platform blends
technology with methods of one-to-one instruction.
16.3
Tailoring Content to Fit the Student
The classrooms and technology you’ve seen will do no good until we are
acquainted with the brain. In particular, let’s address the ﬁve-year-old brain. It is
less developed than the mature brain; it is a simpler model to describe. With the
efﬁciencies we’ll apply, it's slower processing speed and limited capacity for
simultaneous function make it easier to begin crafting truly optimal systems.
Besides, the young brain is a more truthful gauge of educational failure and success;
whereas the mature mind compensates for confusion, such as using prior knowl-
edge, logic, or questioning to correct a failure, the young mind simply halts in
frustration when overwhelmed or confused. Last of all, a system ﬂexible enough to
adapt to the youngest learners will make a superb template for older minds, being a
16
Educational Ergonomics and the Future of the Mind
367

purer window into the brain’s most natural—or least resistant—modes of cognitive
development.
What the 5 year old wants to learn and what they are able to learn both depend
on the ﬁve year old. So the ﬁrst priority of any educational system, this one
especially, must be ﬂexibility. A system which pre-determines content and delivery
is bound to satisfy only few. Technology offers as much ﬂexibility and adaptability
as its designers anticipate and implement. Too often, and mostly because of limited
resources, educational materials are static, or rigid, forcing the student to conform to
the content. The private teacher (and by private, I mean “one-to-one”), like a tailor,
can ﬁt the content to the student, whatever the content and whoever the student, by
making a true assessment of the capability of the student and a proper dissection of
the content’s elements. When these two components—the student and the
content—are properly measured, they can be ﬁtted.
16.4
Component 1: The Content
16.4.1
Content Appeal
Let’s begin with educational content; it is less complex than the student, is within
our control to dissect, and informs neuroscientiﬁc applications of content dissection
based on student capability.
The ﬁrst concern of content is a quick discussion on appeal. The natural parallel
of ensuring an educational system’s ﬂexibility is ensuring its appeal. If education is
to the mind what food is to the body, then dissecting content is something like
cutting up the food of education into the right size bite, delivered at the right speed,
with the right amount of complexity, and neither so little to be malnourished nor so
much to be uncomfortable. Also like food, we eat less when it is unappealing, eat
more when it is appetizing, and stop eating when satisﬁed. Remembering that our
target audience is a 5 year old, envision a picky eater. If you can satisfy a picky eater,
you’re a heck of a cook. What’s most important is that the cook be connected to the
results. Did the meal satisfy? This might seem obvious, but content creators and
curriculum designers are often detached from actual students when making educa-
tional materials or choosing elements for instruction. Students are rarely involved as
stakeholders in the formation of educational content. It’s also often the case that after
content is prepared, the designers aren’t present to see it being used and get little to
no feedback on its reception. It’s a dangerous educational practice to detach the cook
from observing mealtime. The food analogy falls apart when we consider that this is
a meal the cook can’t taste; if they are designing materials for instruction, it is almost
always the case that the designer is a master of the material. Prepared instructional
materials, even digital ones, should be made with the guidance of students, and
tested, or tasted, as it is prepared. Your picky eaters will be your most useful critics.
It’s an even better principle to give your diner a menu to choose from, with the
ﬂexibility to order on or off the menu. (If you’re worried there’s not enough time for
that, we’ll get there soon. For now, rest assured, there’s plenty of time.)

Today’s students are so unnaturally forced into such rigid models of education
that the notion of self-directed learning, or learning directed by a student’s edu-
cational hunger, may sound idealistic. That’s largely because today’s society
almost exclusively learns in groups with very little opportunity to cater to individual
tastes. The whole notion of private, one-to-one learning, can be conceived as a
quest to maximize appeal for and efﬁcacy within the subject. If that’s hard to relate
to, consider taking private lessons in something from a teacher who cares about
your goals, and soon, the curious part of your brain will start to wake from its
slumber and remind you what learning can be. Just like the example from food,
educators, even digital educators, beneﬁt from listening to the hunger and tastes of
their students. When something tastes bad, we don’t need to force the student to eat
it; we can cook better, learn from our mistakes, and in the meantime, allow the
student to try something else.
16.4.2
Content Forms
The form of content, or the manner of its presentation and how a student engages it,
is the prime determinant of a student’s learning outcome.
Here’s an obvious example I’ll call “Bad Violin School:” Suppose you go to
school for violin playing. Over the course of 4 years, you read every important
book on violin playing. You study the ﬁnger patterns and bow techniques of every
major genre of violin music, including the scores of every renowned violinist of
each century since its invention. You can identify relationships of every rhythm,
scale, and key signature, and even produce scale drawings of every part of the
violin from memory. After 10,000 h of study, you earn your certiﬁcate of violin
mastery, but never played a violin. After 10,000 h of work, try picking up a violin
and playing one of those masterwork sonatas and who knows what will come out?!
In the case of the Bad Violin School, the form of the content studied was only a
shadow of violin playing.4 It’s not that work wasn’t done or that learning didn’t
occur, but only that the form of the work leads to a different type of output than was
described in the purpose statement “Suppose you go to school for violin playing.”
The point wasn’t to pull the wool over your eyes, but rather, to illustrate some
related yet tangential aspects of violin playing that aren’t inherent to its success.
There’s a lot about reading and writing without actually playing that stuffed 10,000
of “work” without meaningful substance.
The purpose of Bad Violin School is to mirror most of today’s math education.
How much math instruction occurs without actually doing math? By “doing math,”
I mean engaging the brain in the activity of both calculating and mathematical
reasoning. If a calculator is used, the ﬁrst activity, calculating, isn’t performed by
4If the case seems extreme, consider how many hours of education in Teacher Certiﬁcation
programs are spent working with students in the form of teaching or observing teaching.
16
Educational Ergonomics and the Future of the Mind
369

the brain. If the math problem has been set up for the student, the second activity,
mathematical reasoning, was performed by the problem’s author and not its
intended recipient. In the same way that the work done in Bad Violin School
appears to surround the mastery of violin, so does most work being done in today’s
math classes appear to surround mathematical ability while ultimately failing to
engage students in the processes inherently vital to its ﬂuent development.
The use of calculators and pre-made math problem sheets are themselves just
shadows of general national failure to achieve consistent, predictable, high quality
results in math. A greater, more neuroscientiﬁc problem relates to difﬁculties
achieving mathematical ﬂuency: Whereas math problem sheets are a form of pre-
sentation, and calculators are a mode of executing calculations, both assume visual
symbolic representation of the constituent parts of math. That is, in both cases, the
math is being processed through multiple encoded layers of reading and writing. As
addressed in Part I, objects or concepts from the real world are often referred to by
speciﬁc sets of sounds in the form of spoken words. Mathematics has its own rich
symbol system and grammar, enough (in my opinion) to very rightfully classify it
as a language. But in the context of education, math is a language which must
successfully be distinguished from as well as collaborate with one’s native social
language(s) to achieve ﬂuency. Most importantly to the present attempt at helping
the state of math education is to point out the multiple layers of symbolic encoding
inherent to each respective system and propose that student achievement will be
improved by strategically eliminating layers of encoding unnecessary to the speciﬁc
goal of achieving mathematical ﬂuency.
In practice, this is a neurological argument for eliminating the use written
notation systems for introducing, practicing, and developing mastery in calculation.
This does not mean omitting education of reading and writing the symbols of math,
which are vital components of success in understanding the language of math. But it
does mean drawing a neurological distinction between the brain’s ability to read
and write numbers, and for the brain to develop its ability to actually calculate.
When reading is a prerequisite to calculating, the brain must correctly decode and
remember the meaning of multiple forms of visual information, interpret the rele-
vance of each, then process them according to additional sets of rules (rules for
writing which are themselves a different process than rules for calculating men-
tally). If an error is made at any step, the whole answer becomes wrong.
Let’s travel back to a time when primitive hunters counted the number of woolly
mammoth. Ten big, healthy animals stood in a ﬁeld. The hunter, not having the
language to describe the number, grabs one pebble for each mammoth spied, and
takes the pebbles back to the tribe’s leader, who declares the number “TEN
MAMMOTH!” These words aren’t the same as the mammoth themselves, but
represent mammoths. In this way, the words are like shadows of mammoths, not
being the same as the thing, but outlining it well enough to identify it. The
mammoths could have been represented with little carved wooden statues, or pic-
tures drawn on walls, or a set of smoke signals, or spoken words, and each would
have been a shadow of the real woolly mammoth. All that is required to be
meaningful is that the presenter and observer agree upon the meaning of the
370
Z.R. Tolan

symbols: “When I put ten woolly mammoth carvings on this part of the ground, and
draw this set of lines in the dirt and point in that direction, I mean there are ten real
woolly mammoths in that direction right now!” These are basic shadows of real life
objects that people without language can understand. You don’t need to go to
school to understand it, but you might have to see it once.
Smoke signals offer the potential for greater complexity of shadow types.
A smoke signal won’t look especially like a woolly mammoth, (except by unlikely
coincidence, I suppose), so it requires a bit of stronger communication to agree that
1. the hunting party seeks woolly mammoths, and 2. when found, build a ﬁre and
signal one puff of smoke for each mammoth you ﬁnd. Ten puffs? Ten woolly
mammoths. Alternatively, smoke signals could ﬁrst encode the type of animal
found, where perhaps *big puff* *big puff* means “woolly mammoth.” and *small
puff* *small puff* means “deer.” If there are only a few dozen types of animals that
can be found and smoke signals are only used for hunting, then unique sets of
signals could be used to refer to speciﬁc animals, and the total count of them could
be delivered in average size puffs after the animal type is identiﬁed. It’s more
cognitively complex, but could be more efﬁcient. The need for additional layers of
encoding comes with the need to describe more diverse content types.
Smoke signals also offer the potential to represent shadows of shadows. As need
begets increased complexity, especially as spoken language leads to the develop-
ment of an alphabet, smoke signals might be most efﬁciently used by encoding a set
of puffs to each letter of the alphabet, like Morse Code, where (in English) a mere
26 letters can successfully communicate any complexity of idea. In this case, smoke
signals represent letters which form written words which represent spoken words
which represent real woolly mammoths. As odd as it sounds to describe it that way,
this process of encoding has been historically revolutionary to communication
efﬁciency, especially notable in the telegraph lines of the 19th century, where
electrical signals delivered communications hundreds of miles away at supersonic
speeds. Just because the mature brain is capable of managing such complex forms
of encoding doesn’t imply whatsoever that it is any sort of neurological ideal,
especially in foundational stages of learning.
When important information about math, literature, science, history, music, art,
athletics, language, et cetera ad inﬁnitum, is encoded in any way, its accessibility is
constrained proportionally by the level of complexity of the encoding, the difﬁculty
of its presentation, and the capability of the student. Therefore, content forms are of
utmost importance in preparing a learning environment for the student in which
they can comfortably achieve success. These are the primary considerations of
educational ergonomics. Having addressed reducing content types to their mini-
mally complex form, we are now able to explore how to appropriately ﬁt content to
the student.
16
Educational Ergonomics and the Future of the Mind
371

16.4.3
Content Dissection
The presentation of content, whenever displayed by a substitute for the real-world
object, is always a symbolic “shadow,” or a set of shadows pointing back to the
object. Once the most direct shadow is chosen, the educator can begin preparing the
content for efﬁcient engagement by the student. This stage of curriculum prepa-
ration forms the bridge between content and the student, and there is no way to
know the most efﬁcient preparation of content without knowing the capabilities of
the student. I’ve placed the discussion on content before the discussion on the
student because we can control how content is crafted for engagement. Equipped
with efﬁcient modes of representation, thoughtful dissection can make most content
accessible to most students.
Let’s consider an example from the high classical period of music: Beethoven’s
Symphony #5. First, it’s made for listening, and any student with a healthy sense of
hearing is able to listen. In this way, any healthy student, even a 5 year old, can
passively engage with the content. But suppose we want the student to actively
engage with the content. Options include humming along, but the polyphonic
nature of it (multiple simultaneous tones in harmony) might be confusing to some,
leading to the potential to hum incoherent portions of the melody at some points,
and various portions of the harmony at others. This is solvable by isolating the
theme, or the prominent melody, apart from other aspects. Suppose, once the
melody is isolated, that the amount of melodic content is too much to be retained in
the student’s short-term memory: Isolate smaller sections. Suppose that once the
content is isolated into small enough of a section as to theoretically ﬁt the capacity
of the student’s short-term memory that it is still incomprehensible, perhaps it is
being presented too fast: slow it down.
If this approach must be taken for each piece of content that a student may want
to engage, it would be too frustrating to be worthwhile; but if the content is
presented from the beginning in small enough a chunk at slow enough a speed,
isolated to the pertinent melodic theme only, then there is no frustration. The key to
educational success is making a scientiﬁcally informed estimate accurate enough
from the onset that it accommodates the tolerance of the student. While individual
human brains do vary somewhat, they are more similar than they are different, and
despite variations in theoretical frameworks like IQ or aptitude estimates of various
Intelligences, it is Beethoven who, in this case, has done the work of crafting
something of musical value well enough that it still connects with the human
psyche hundreds of years after its design. We educators have responsibility to a
different art entirely.
Here, our hypothetical music student engaged with Symphony #5 with their
natural instrument, their voice, and it is their humming along that is the shadow of
the melodic theme of the original work. I choose humming because it is a relatively
simple neurological pattern: the same part of the brain that processes the sound
heard is that which processes creating the sound with your own voice: if mentally
only—humming along in your head, without the use of your voice, like sounding
372
Z.R. Tolan

out words in your head without vocalization—it is even less complex than by also
engaging the vocal chords, which upon doing so not only requires part of the brain
to process the physical activity of humming, but also adds new sounds to the
environment which are also heard and processed in the mind, then maybe also
compared to the sound of the original melodic theme presented. When comparison
to the original occurs, a higher order cognitive process occurs than when, for
example, the melody is produced on an instrument like the piano, whose intonation
is in the control of the piano’s tuner more than its performer. It’s somewhat
important to note that a musician could play an instrument like the piano for
thousands of hours without developing the part of the brain which affects the sense
of intonation, or correct pitch; to put it another way, deaf people can play beautiful
music on the piano through understanding its arrangement mathematically more
than musically. The same statement is less applicable to an instrument like trom-
bone or violin where precise location is usually guided by responding to minute
auditory cues.
Our discussion on Content Dissection has only addressed reproductions of
Content Forms without the use of symbolic representations, such written and read
notation systems. Content Dissection also pertains to Content Forms, especially
when written notation systems are truly more efﬁcient for engaging content,
especially amounts of content beyond retention in the short-term memory.5 Careful
inspection of just how much information can be retained in the short-term memory
of a student, especially a 5 year old, reveals nearly disturbing realities about how
the world’s several hundred million students are taught, but as uncomfortable as the
reality of the situation is, take heart that good diagnosis informs remedies. In the
former paragraph on humming Symphony #5, the brain was inherently limited by
its capacity to retain and process heard auditory information; written notation
systems have no such inherent limitation. To the contrary, one of their primary
functions is to preserve information beyond the limits of the mind. In that sense,
they exist in response to our brain’s limits, and are able to do that which our brain
cannot. To reiterate a point from a previous paragraph, these written notation
systems became more complex over time and stand in place of information in
multiple degrees of detachment from the real-world object. In the same way that
audio engagement of Beethoven’s 5th Symphony can be made accessible through
multiple stages of dissection and simpliﬁcation, so, too, can notation systems.
5This discussion is dangerous because it verges on opening Pandora’s Box, which spilled every
evil into the world and retained, in the end, only hope; When an amount of new information is
presented to a student that is beyond their capacity to process, it’s a waste of time to the teacher
and the student. What good could it do to present more new information than your student’s mind
can consciously process? This isn’t to say that there’s no purpose in such a decision, but be
deliberate and purposeful about it, lest the only thing that remains from such an endeavor is, like
Pandora’s Box, hope for learning. Short-Term Memory is the primary building block for shifting
datum of any sort into more permanent states of memory—ﬁrst the Working Memory (which is
theoretically inﬁnite), then through successive repetitions of varying frequency and intensity, into
Long-Term Memory. These are the dynamics which become increasingly important as we
approach educational ergonomics pertaining directly to The Student.
16
Educational Ergonomics and the Future of the Mind
373

Suppose the student wishes to play Beethoven’s 5th Symphony on an instrument
(other than their voice) and with the help of a written notation system. A traditional
approach to this particular song would usually involve hundreds of hours of study
in other songs before being considered reasonably accessible. And there’s no reason
to suppose that when Beethoven wrote it, he had in mind teaching it to 5 year olds.
Nonetheless, his art is different than ours. The approach used in considering how to
teach humming along reveals some aspects of strategic content dissection—isolate
the melody, reduce it to manageably sized chunks, reduce the demands of a fast
tempo, etc.—but these don’t address the particular demands of written notation.
Until now, reading wasn’t involved.
Naturally, we take standard music notation, isolate the melody, and present
bite-size chunks. But just like the Symphony itself, standard notation wasn’t
designed for 5 year olds. It, like other notation systems, is the product of centuries
of evolution in efﬁciency. Although it can be modiﬁed in a variety of ways to ease
use by students, such as clearly printing the notes instead of sloppily and incon-
sistently writing them by hand, printing the notes larger, and eliminating the need to
remember rules of the grammar of music (such as “key signatures,” the set of sharps
and ﬂats at the beginning of each line that must be constantly remembered to
correctly play the indicated varieties of tones), this system, designed for composers
and professional musicians, can be replaced altogether by one designed especially
for youth, ideally, using elements from a notation system they already know and
can naturally compare to the instrument at-hand. In some schools, letters of the
alphabet are used to indicate tones (A, B, C, D, E, F, G), which is an advantage to
students who are already familiar with the alphabet. This has the potential to
reinforce other learning if it intersects with other uses of the alphabet, such as
reading English, as well as the potential to cause cognitive conﬂict by introducing
one system whose rules of use differ by context.
As with other aspects of educative decision making, there is not one correct
philosophical answer, no teacher, superintendent, or cognitive neuroscientist who
can deﬁnitely say one is universally better than another. Although the phrase “best
practice” often surfaces in the quest to maximize educational efﬁciency, what is
truly best for a particular student depends on the particular student. Thankfully,
educators—even those of digital education systems—can consult the student, and
anticipate methods of enabling students—even 5 year olds—to choose for
themselves.
16.5
Component 2: The Student
What wonderful good can be done by reducing content complexity, preparing
various forms of representation, and estimating a content’s cognitive complexity, all
aimed at enabling the students to make up their own mind about their personal
formation. It’s almost utopian. Although we’ve only had a taste of how the food of
education can be prepared, let’s explore the palette of the mind.
374
Z.R. Tolan

Here’s a nuts-and-bolts version of how learning happens: Information of some
kind (sound, sight, temperature, whatever…) is perceived by a recipient. If it’s
given conscious focus, it lands in the Short-Term Memory (0-60 s, 1-10 items),
where it has the potential to move into Working Memory for semi-permanent recall
(less than 24 h, hypothetically inﬁnite potential capacity). If the sensory data can be
recalled more than 24 h later, we say it’s in Long-Term Memory,6 although this is
far from a guarantee that it will be retrievable a week or a decade later. If the
sensory data is never re-engaged, either through external re-stimulation or internal
recall, it’ll probably be forgotten, because the brain isn’t in the business of stufﬁng
itself with meaninglessness.7
The likelihood of an experience being remembered or forgotten depends on the
intensity and frequency of exposure. The minimum duration required for long-term
learning to occur from any any particular experience concerns the overall efﬁciency
of learning. The interval between learning episodes affects the brain’s ability to
recall information, as there is a limited window of non-engagement before cognitive
atrophy occurs. These four dimensions of learning—intensity, frequency, duration,
and interval—affect the likelihood of forming high-quality, long-term memories by
engaging the learner’s Short-Term Memory, Working Memory, and Long-Term
Memory, all vary by student,8 and are the foundational constituent aspects of
optimized educational efﬁciency.
Let’s consider some variations on educative routines, each containing 100 rep-
etitions of a particular learning goal, distributed over different frequencies, inten-
sities, durations, and intervals. For this example, let’s suppose the learning goal is to
memorize a random set of ten numbers,9 whose success will be measured
6Sousa, David A. How the Brain Learns. 3rd ed. Thousand Oaks, Calif: Corwin Press (2006).
7“Forgotten” is usually used loosely. Most sensory perceptions, whether temperature or sound or
whatever, once perceived by the brain, affect its biological tissue somewhat. When it affects the
tissue in such a miniscule way that distinct recall isn’t possible, we usually say it’s been forgotten.
A culture of test-makers and test-takers might think that not being able to recall the right infor-
mation at the right time means you didn’t learn it, but that’s not exactly a cognitive neuroscientiﬁc
perspective. Alas, this essay is more concerned with how to remember something well than
deﬁning the parameters of forgetting, so let’s all agree to concentrate on deﬁning the parameters of
remembering well.
8Don’t fear the variations; students aren’t as variable as they might seem. While every student is a
unique little snowﬂake, remember that snowﬂakes are quite similar in composition, and being
similar in composition, share predictably uniform properties: Although the shape of their crys-
tallization is always unique, they all crystallize at zero degrees Celsius.
9I choose a random set of ten numbers because it is beyond the short-term memory capacity of
most young students, is comparable to the length of a phone number, and because most of us have
childhood phone numbers that we memorized and can still remember after more than 1000 days of
non-use. Also, the set of ten numbers might be partially recalled, where some students remember
only the ﬁrst few or the last few, which can also be used to estimate overall efﬁcacy.

1000 days from the end of the last educative engagement,10 and the highest average
quality of recollection wins.11
Variation One might be to hear and orally repeat the set of ten numbers 100
times all in one day. Variation Two might be to repeat the set of numbers 10 times a
day for 10 days. Which do you think will work better? Most of us probably believe,
intuitively or based on experience, that spreading the repetitions over multiple days
will work better. Let’s continue.
Variation Three might be to repeat the set of numbers ﬁve times a day for
20 days. If we believe spacing out the repetitions is advantageous to memory
formation, then maybe we should say Variation Four is to repeat the set of numbers
once a day for 100 days. Do we anticipate problems with this much spread?
Perhaps that is the best bet, so far…
Who says, though, that once each day is best? Let’s say that Variation Five is
repeating the content once every other day for 200 days. We’re contemplating the
subtle variations in the impact of interval between learning sessions. Let’s say
Variation Six is repeating the content once every three days for 300 days. Which,
intuitively, do you think results in the best long-term recall? Or do you think
Variations Four, Five, and Six will result in generally similar outcomes?
So far, all of the examples have been generally linear in form. That is, the
intervals have been evenly distributed. Although we are often biased toward linear
thinking, there is no reason to make such linear assumptions about human learning.
Consider Variation Seven, which might suppose that the ﬁrst repetition set occurs
four times, every 3 days, ﬁve times in each of those days, using 20 of the 100
allowable. The next repetition set occurs twenty times, every 3 days, only once
each day, using the next 20 repetitions, totaling 40 repetitions used. The next 40
repetitions are scheduled to occur every 5 days, also once each day, and the ﬁnal 20
repetitions occur every 10 ten days, once each day. Variation Seven, if graphed,
would look something like a hyperbola instead of a straight line. From experience,
many of us might vote for Variation Seven as the most effective repetition set.
Variations One through Seven have only considered three of the four dimensions
of learning, namely, frequency (which each variation is limited to 100), intensity
(whether some are repeated multiple times in the same day), and interval12
10If the quality of long-term recollection was evaluated 1000 days after the student’s ﬁrst expo-
sure, and if we are testing true long-term memory formation, it would be unfair, for example, to
reserve some of the 100 allowable engagements for the day before assessment, so assessment must
occur 1000 days after their ﬁnal engagement.
11The nature of the experiment requires that different students use different distributions of rep-
etitions, and the natural argument for explaining the results might be that their different aptitudes
will be more inﬂuential in determining their long-term results than the pattern of repetitions. While
this is true to a degree, reliable results can be obtained by assigning large numbers of students to
each pattern and averaging their outcomes.
12Interval could be divided into long-term intervals, such as we have described as occurring over
multiple days, or could be described in the short-term as how many hours, minutes, or seconds
occur between repetitions. I have often observed students exhibit less proﬁciency between repe-
titions when interrupted between, even for just enough time to make or listen to a comment. So it

(how much space occurs between learning sessions).13 The fourth dimension,
duration, is less apparent than the others, yet has an impact of its own. We must
consider whether each repetition is spoken and repeated variably or at the same
tempo each time, or what manner of tempo is used (slow, medium, fast, etc.), and
whether the same tempo is always used or if there is help or harm in strategically
varying it over time. Naturally, slower tempos yield longer durations, but are also
one factor which impacts the perception of ease or difﬁculty and act on the psy-
chological appeal of the act of learning: perhaps a fast tempo is exciting to one
student but exhausting to another.
Tempo also acts on the ability of Short-Term Memory, since its limits concern
both quantity of information and elapsed time. If repeating the set of ten numbers
slowly, such as one number every 2 s, might that yield more difﬁcult recall than a
quick repetition set, such as three numbers per second? It might be advantageous to
recite the number set slowly at ﬁrst, then progressively quicker after a certain
number of repetition sets, which is closer to the natural model of language devel-
opment, where words are sounded out slowly at ﬁrst, but eventually used in faster
contexts. One prominent instructor of the Russian School of Ballet14 attributes
some of their success to taking the same exercises as devised by the French School
of Ballet, doubling their repetitions, and halving the tempo at which they were
practiced, thereby quadrupling the total duration of exercises by only doubling the
repetitions.
These four dimensions of learning are difﬁcult for teachers to plan, implement,
and monitor, especially when considering very ﬁne aspects, such as progressive
alteration to tempo of presentation and engagement. But what is impractically
difﬁcult for humans can be programmed into computers and implemented effort-
lessly. What matters ﬁrst is mere awareness of the possibilities, and whether
designing such a system is ultimately practical. Having spent some effort surveying
the horizon of such a system, permit me the chance to paint a picture of its potential.
After all, so far we’ve only explored an arbitrary string of numbers.
(Footnote 12 continued)
might make a difference for long-term results whether the repetitions occur in uninterrupted
succession, or spaced out in a pattern such as once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and once
in the evening. I personally lean toward quick, uninterrupted succession as more effective, but
veriﬁcation would require scientiﬁc investigation.
13The human lifespan is inherently prohibitive to extreme examples, such as one repetition each
year for 100 years; even if it yielded the best result (and I don’t think it would), education must
prepare the student for more practical outcomes. Although 100 years is far-fetched for most
desirably practical learning outcomes, a very real practical timeframe for most students isn’t a
semester, or a year, but from childhood to adulthood, or by today’s standards, 18–22 years. When
considering truly ideal distributions of repetition for content mastery, examples such as language
acquisition (especially foreign language acquisition), mathematical ability, and physical motor
skills are examples which we already acknowledge require and deserve regular repetition over
more than a decade.

16.6
Maximizing Human Potential and the Future
of the Mind
Instead of using a ﬁne-tuned digital education platform for memorizing a string of
random numbers, imagine that it was used for something important. Whatever that
is, is up to you. But the idea is that whatever you consider worth learning, for as
long as you consider it worth learning, can be programmed for repeated engage-
ment for as long as you consider it worth engaging. It is a digital means of assuring
that today’s effort is not wasted because of tomorrow’s neglect. Nothing needs to
reach the point of forgetting or regaining lost ground due to passing time. When
considering knowledge in the form of skills or information, the human brain nat-
urally learns most things in seconds. If you think about it, the vast collection of
learning that is in each of our minds all occurred in seconds and collections of
seconds over the years of our lives. Most of these seconds, especially in classrooms,
were focused on a single subject at a time, taught in a linear progression, and often
abandoned after the unit, semester, or grade level. Therefore, most of these seconds
count as basic exposure only. In part, it was a product of the times. But today, we
can do better.
In the same number of classroom hours, content can be strategically rearranged
to utilize age-and-aptitude-appropriate dimensions of learning with individual stu-
dents, according to their interests. Multiple, neurologically compatible channels of
information can be presented and engaged simultaneously, eliciting ranges of high
and low conscious focus, and enabling students access to dynamically adjust their
level of stimulation and engagement at any point in time. The efﬁciency of their
engagement is up to them, as is the depth and breadth of their engagement with any
topic vertically or horizontally, meaning that a topic can be explored in greater
precision or depth, or learned as part of a broader context. The overall point of the
system is to present, engage, and distribute the instructive, developmental com-
ponent of learning as efﬁciently as possible, with as great a guarantee of
high-quality, long-term retention as possible.
Such a radical view of potential efﬁciency leads to hypothetical results that are
theoretically sound but hard to believe, but disbelief is almost a predictable
response to results formed from the accumulation of very small amounts over very
long periods of time, such as the accretion of the space particles into the sun and
planets, the evolution of species, or compound interest. Applied to education, I
don’t see why a student steadily interested in languages couldn’t obtain ﬂuency in
eight, twelve, or more world languages by investing ﬁve-to-ten minutes (or less)
every other day from Kindergarten through twelfth grade. As mentioned in Part I,
languages are useful for introducing content pertaining to most subjects, so other
learning goals can be simultaneously achieved with strategic applications. If applied
on a large scale, the average human vocabulary could literally multiply tenfold over
the course of a century, from 15,000–25,000 words to 150,000–250,000 words,
revolutionizing today’s literacy norm. If that seems unfathomable, consider that
there was a point in human history when the average vocabulary was one-tenth of
378
Z.R. Tolan

its present average, and in very recent history, including some parts of the world
today, written literacy is still one-tenth of the world’s average.
Beyond the marvelous potential for a world made better through the advance-
ment of education are discoveries yet undiscovered, but not undiscoverable. As the
potential for certain types of learning fades and sometimes vanishes with inactivity
over time, many of us today don’t fully know ourselves because of potential
unnurtured in our earliest years. It is the case that if you didn’t use your legs, or
eyes, or sense of sound, for the ﬁrst 10 years of life, the portions of the brain that
normally develop when those senses are stimulated would remain permanently
dormant, even if the limbs or senses were originally otherwise perfectly healthy and
able [1]. It is this view of human capability that carries the greatest urgency. When
aspects of our own humanity are neglected during certain crucial “windows of
opportunity,” the window closes and the potential for development of ﬂuency or, in
extreme cases of neglect, even basic functionality, vanishes. Of the 21 human
senses, only few currently receive deliberate, systematic development. Who knows
what the state of national health might be if today’s adult population was delib-
erately and systematically instructed from youth about the stomach’s stretch
receptors, and in distinguishing the body’s sense of hunger from its sense of thirst,
which according to some studies [2], are often confused.
The advancement of education and the advancement of society are, to me,
absolutely synonymous. The causes of conﬂict can be eliminated only through the
advancement of both. Individual happiness, securing the means of widespread and
enduring peace, and promoting the general good all demand a view of society—and
our role in it—that both sees beyond ourselves while simultaneously accounting for
our individual roles and responsibilities as members of it. As Einstein said, “The
signiﬁcant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were
at when we created them.” [3]. His generation created the nuclear bomb. The next
created the computer. What will we create?

lag in math. (http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=94793). These headlines are
accurate. Our students are performing below expectations and behind their inter-
national peers. The reasons for our less than desired results are many and deeply
embedded in our processes and societal norms. However, with advances in neu-
roscience and learning technology, we can make signiﬁcant improvements and
begin the process of changing the way we teach and learn math.
Based on international math tests, U.S. students rank from the mid teens to as
low as the mid 30’s in international comparisons. With each set of disappointing
test results, our education system comes under pressure. Although understandable,
the perception that the scores stem from recently failed education policies or
practices is not entirely correct. The U.S. has been performing below our interna-
tional peers for over 50 years.
The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) has been admin-
istering tests every 3 years since 2000. The United States has ranked as high as the
20th nation, but we have been ranked in the 30’s for three of the ﬁve assessments
(2015 results are not yet available), with a low ranking of 36th in 2012.
Before PISA, The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational
Achievement has conducted international tests since the 1960’s. Again, the U.S.
consistently scored well below our international peers.

At the core of the issue is the structure of math content. Math skills and concepts
are numerous and varied. While often perceived and dealt with as if they are unique,
math skills are connected and hierarchical in their nature. Many content areas build
on prior knowledge, but only math relies on such a vast set of prerequisites for
ongoing success.
The fact that mastery requires conceptualization further complicates the issue.
The skill of addition can be acquired in its most basic form relatively easily.
However, without an accurate conceptualization of addition, students will begin to
make errors when fractions, negative numbers, or variables become the addends.
To add negative numbers successfully, students must understand and combine
the separate concepts of addition and negative numbers. If students have erro-
neously conceptualized addition as the operation that makes numbers larger (as they
often do), they will be unable to add negative numbers successfully.
17.2
Structure of Math
The structure of math is the at the core of the problem, but it is not unique to the U.
S. All nations are dealing with this issue. Our poor results must stem from issues
related to our societal norms, education processes, and pedagogy. One factor is our
societal norm that is OK not to like math or be good at math. We have come a long
way in addressing illiteracy and creating a national norm that we will all be able to
read. But we continue to condone our math failings.
Although our societal acceptance of math inadequacy is a factor, it is also a
symptom. The 50+ years of poor performance has created a population of citizens
that have math skill deﬁciencies. It is not uncommon to hear “our family does not
have a math gene” or “we are just not good at math”. Without the proper support,
encouragement, and role models our students are facing an uphill battle in their
efforts to acquire math skills and master math concepts.
17.3
Educational Structure
Our educational structure also plays a role. We rely on a student’s age to determine
their math content. Once in the system, students are moved from one grade to the
next without a meaningful review of their math mastery. Only in the rare cases of
students being identiﬁed as needing special services is the lack of math under-
standing systemically addressed when moving on to the next year’s curriculum.
Instead of a systemic approach, we have relied on teachers to identify skill/concept
gaps for each student and address them as part of their math pedagogy.
The reliance on a teacher’s ability is where we actually can witness the students
falling off the wagon. While some teachers have the skill set for effective differ-
entiation, most of us do not. When I began my teaching career at the age of 45,
382
L. Watson

I was convinced that I wanted to teach Algebra to middle and early high school
students. These are the grades where the research says we lose math students, and I
wanted to keep that from happening.
In my ﬁrst year, it was clear that many of my students had fallen off the wagon
before they arrived at middle school. I had students that could not add single digit
positive integers. Others could not understand the concepts related to negative
numbers, fractions, or decimals. Over 50 % of them had an aversion to math and
lacked the belief that they could ﬁx their math deﬁciencies.
There were also students that came in prepared and eager. Math was fun and
exciting, or at least, they were buoyed by their past success. The combination of
these students in a single class caused me to search for differentiation strategies.
How could I create an environment where all of my students would be able to reach
their individual potentials? I tried almost every research-based strategy I could ﬁnd.
Each time I was disappointed.
Grouping advanced students with struggling students helped with the group
dynamic, but did not make meaningful impacts in skill acquisition for the struggling
students and advanced students reported feeling limited. High ceiling/low ﬂoor
projects allowed all students to participate but failed to ensure all students had the
opportunity to acquire the intended skill and master the underlying concepts. With
each strategy, I felt that the class was moving through the curriculum, but without
individual students making the progress they should and could if I were able to
meet their needs.
I have come to realize that all these factors that make math education so difﬁcult
affect our students at different times in their math careers. Some to a small extent
and they can self-correct; others to a larger degree and we often leave them behind.
Once a student falls off the math wagon, we replace them with a cardboard cutout
and continue driving the wagon forward. We act like they are with us, and are
confused by their blank stares. In reality, they are still back on the road where they
ﬁrst fell off, struggling to make it on their own, and hoping that we will come back
and pick them up.
As we move forward, this needs to be a focus of our efforts. Each student
deserves the attention they need, when they need it, and for the speciﬁc areas they
need it. In Finland (recent scores are in the top 5 consistently in international
assessments), over 50 % of students receive some special education support during
their years in school (http://www.stat.ﬁ/til/erop/2014/erop_2014_2015-06-11_tau_
006_en.html). Finland is putting the students back on the wagon as they fall off.
17.4
Individualized Learning Plans
In the U.S., we have a different view of special education services. We do not
implement them at the ﬁrst sign of a student falling behind. Instead, we reserve our
special education services for students with identiﬁed learning disabilities. While it
17

would be ideal to change this approach, a shift of this magnitude will require a
signiﬁcant amount of legislative and societal will and is not likely anytime soon.
We need to ﬁnd a solution now, and must look for an alternative.
We need to identify, assess, and work with our students so that they are reaching
the levels of success that they are capable of, no matter how high. It all begins with
the accurate assessment of the current state of a student’s math skills and knowl-
edge. Without a thorough assessment, we end up wasting time addressing skills and
concepts that are either already understood or beyond their current ability to fully
understand. However, an initial assessment is only valuable until the student makes
some amount of progress in the determined areas. At this point, the initial deter-
mination is outdated and must be repeated.
The continual assessment of mastered and needed skills and concepts ties
directly to the individualized learning plan. Students need to know what skills and
concepts they need to work on and have them arranged to ensure that we have
prioritized the prerequisites. Again, to manage this manually is almost impossible.
I have read about teachers that were able to develop processes that achieve this
goal, but most of us do not have the time or organizational skills to be consistently
successful.
When we provide students the opportunity to work on math skills and concepts
that are within their grasp, they begin to experience success. This success builds
awareness that they can learn math, and they have the intellect to be successful. It
can also expand into math enthusiasm and a desire to seek out higher levels of
math. Both the higher skilled and the struggling student experience the positive
feelings that come with learning math that was once unknown. I often tell my
students that nothing feels better than solving a hard math problem. You feel
accomplished, smarter, and ready for the next challenge. It is empowering.
Implementing and managing individualized learning plans is where we can use
the advances in technology to help us. We now have the ability to see into the
minds of our students, assess their math skills, and chart a course for math success.
The automated learning systems available today make the process of individual-
izing math education a reality.
In my class, I have used three different automated learning systems over the past
6 years. I have found all of them to have unique features and challenges. However,
each one enabled my students to have math success at their level. Engagement
levels in my classroom are regularly 90–100 % and discipline issues are almost
nonexistent. Students understand what they are working on and what skills and
concepts are next in their learning plan. I have connected their grades to class
mastery of skills and concepts, so students understand what is required to obtain a
speciﬁc grade. Thus, grading discussions are data based and often result in a
concrete plan of improvement.
384

17.5
Automated Learning Systems
These impacts to my classroom are primarily due to the use of automated learning
systems. I am not skilled enough, nor do I have the energy or organizational skills
to achieve these results on my own. We have access to tools that automate the initial
and ongoing assessment, the creation and updating of the individualized learning
plan, and the access to and management of student data.
While impressive, the automated learning tools have some signiﬁcant chal-
lenges. Due to their static structure, they do not reach across the learning modalities
effectively. Limited explanations or help with skills and concepts do not allow for
alternative solutions nor do they accommodate student questions. Also, once
implemented, you can see and must address the various levels of math skills in your
classroom. The different levels and pace of work introduces a high level of vari-
ability and an element of chaos into a classroom where tradition has preferred order
and structure.
However, the two biggest challenges are related to understanding. The ﬁrst
challenge is application. The automated learning systems are excellent in allowing
students to acquire and practice skills. However, they are limited in their ability to
provide opportunities to apply concepts. Each of the systems I have used has
attempted to include concept application, but all have fallen short.
The lack of conceptual understanding is related to the second challenge of depth
of knowledge (DOK). There are various methods and terminology regarding DOK.
However, for this discussion we will summarize these into four levels: supported
practice; independent practice; synthesis; application. It is difﬁcult in a systematic
program to reach DOK levels that require synthesis and application on a consistent
basis.
The following chart summarizes my experiences with the three systems I have
used in my classroom. I am currently using ALEKS. My knowledge of the
TenMarks is based on 2014–2015 features and functionality and Accelerated Math
is based on 2012–2013 features and functionality. Each of the areas of functionality
is scored from 1 * (limited to no functionality) to 4 * (full functionality).

As we move forward, the use of automated learning systems can provide a
signiﬁcant advantage in the development and implementation of individualized
learning plans. As technology and our understanding of the brain improve we
should be able to incorporate higher levels of DOK within the systems. These
systems will also be able to assess our students more accurately and pinpoint areas
that need attention.
The use of automated learning systems will allow us to engage the students in
real-world problem-solving based on their skill levels. Imagine an environment
where students could select a cross-curriculum project to work on based on their
preferences and their skill levels. If students desired to work on a higher-level
project, they would have the information to identify the needed skills and the tools
to acquire them. Learning would have a direct purpose, and the students would be
in charge of their education.
We need to use our education time effectively to teach the skills and concepts the
individual student needs and then allow them to apply them in ways that are unique
to the student. This dynamic environment is what we can create through the use of
automated learning systems.

We concluded from the research that more time is spent on
learning in the online environment. Many of the systems provide
real-time feedback to students and individualized instruction. It
also appears that the online-learning environment is more
engaging.

XQ Super School
My vision in creating an XQ super school is to provide a virtual place where
students have easy access to a quality education that is free and accessible via the
internet. At Bolder Super School, the students will apply their gained knowledge
into real world situations through either internships or volunteer opportunities in
their community. Finally, through practical application of their skills and knowl-
edge, students will be assessed by teachers or experts in the ﬁeld. I view online
education as a way to equalize an education system that has many inherent
inequalities from budgets to access to excellent teachers. Using free resources
allows any student to gain whatever knowledge they are interested in, while also
getting as much depth of knowledge as they want. The biggest obstacle is the issue
of internet access, so schools need to partner with local organizations to gain
internet access. We are looking into the possibility of providing laptops for every
student and even cloud based Wi-Fi (http://shop.brck.com/brcks/brck-v1.html).

Free and Low Cost Education
Its common knowledge that schools everywhere are suffering from severe budget
constraints. In my hometown, I remember watching the local elections to see if
people would vote to increase funding for the schools, keep it the same, or reduce it.
When budgets are cut, the teachers are laid off; class sizes increase; and art, music
and physical education programs suffer. In the end, the students suffer. As an
educator, I have realized that in our modern society, it should be easy to learn things
from the internet at no cost. As a student, I can easily go online and watch videos,
read articles, or ﬁnd pictures that are presented in ways that interest me. However,
in the current system it’s difﬁcult to show what I’ve learned, and receive academic
credit. This is where the idea of allowing students to simply prove their knowledge
through varied assessments came to me. Not all kids are good test takers, but if a
student learns a concept on their own and then uses that knowledge to create
something, why should that not count as academic progress?

mindshift/2012/05/31/how-open-education-is-changing-the-texture-of-content/) is a
more natural way of learning. This allows students to use more creative problem
solving, ﬁll in the blanks, and ﬁnd out how different subjects are related. Also,
students will be able to take classes in smaller chunks which may make a subject
more interesting or accessible. An example would be instead of having a student
take a semester or year of a history class, they could choose to take an introductory
unit on the civil war, study Napoleon’s battle tactics or look at the events that led up
to World War II. Next, students could expand their knowledge in whatever subjects
they ﬁnd interesting and ﬁnd ways that link their lessons together. This allows the
students to be more active learners. They gain the ability to analyze information and
draw conclusions rather than just being told “this is what lead to that.”

Skill Repair
The Bolder Super School allows students to work within more ﬂexible time con-
straints and deadlines—much as we adults experience in the real world. Also,
education is about learning from your mistakes and correcting them, so the students
will be able to retake any unit they fail or don’t understand. If the way the infor-
mation was presented wasn’t effective for the student, the school will provide them
with alternative resources that would teach the same information, but in a different
388
A. Donaldson

way that may be more experiential or appeal to their learning styles. The lessons
will also be designed around a student’s strengths and interests. Students will be
able to see how different lessons relate to subjects they are interested in. For
example, if a student is very strong in social studies, but not math, they would only
need to learn the math skills necessary for social studies. In order to ensure that all
the students are gain an adequate foundation of knowledge, Bolder Super School
will provide a clear visual representation of all the required knowledge they need to
acquire in order to graduate. Finally, students will also be able to seek out additional
help from our extended network of staff and volunteers to receive any additional
academic tutoring or even personal mentoring they may need to help them as they
develop and mature. The goal is to guide students into becoming responsible adults
with the skills they need to thrive in a constantly changing workforce.
Today’s students will not live in a world where things change relatively slowly (as many of
us did), but rather one in which things change extremely rapidly- daily and exponentially.
So today’s teachers need to be sure that, no matter what subject they are teaching, they are
teaching it with that future in mind.
—Marc Prensky, Teaching Digital Natives
Through the education methods of Bolder Super School, by the time a student
graduates, they will have the knowledge, skills, and connections to become
successful.
18.5
Online Education
In the current system, there are many beneﬁts and problems with online education.
The beneﬁts include ﬂexibility of scheduling and in how lessons are presented and
assessed—an alternative to traditional high schools that some students may ﬁnd a
better ﬁt for them. However, some of the problems include: not having adequate
personal support, a limit on how information is presented since it is usually pre-
pared by the school, lack of opportunities to develop social and professional skills,
and very little is offered in terms of experiential learning and project based
assessment. My goal is to address these issues by providing a school where the
students would have differentiated instruction not necessarily from teachers, but
from whatever online content appeals to their learning sensibilities.
They would have access to a network of tutors and mentors to give them
academic and emotional support. Also, students would be able to ﬁnd in their
community, opportunities to volunteer or intern with local companies in order to
foster networking and local connections. Finally, students will be assessed through
a variety of methods. Some students may ﬁnd it better to have a multiple choice
test, while others may ﬁnd it a better ﬁt to create a project that shows understanding
of fundamental concepts, possibly across a variety of subject areas. An example
would be a student creating an object, project or presentation that applies concepts
from math, physics, biology, or social studies which could then be assessed for
18
XQ Super Schools—Bolder Super School Project
389

understanding of those concepts as well as the practicality/originality of their
product. This is one of the core concepts—students being able to solve problems
and be innovative. This is important because in self-directed learning. Students
need to ﬁnd the internal drive to continue after making mistakes.
18.6
Motivation
One complaint I have heard repeatedly is that it can be hard to be self-motivated
when taking an online class, which is why it is so important to have a network of
physical spaces for the students to work with tutors to help them understand con-
cepts, and offer guidance on how to solve problems they cannot solve on their own.
Some authors report that online learning can be very effective depending on the subject,
although perhaps, in courses where problem solving is required, such as science or math
courses, face-to-face instruction or at least synchronous chat with the instructor may be
preferred over asynchronous, online learning.
—Research in Higher Education Journal
Another issue is the dropout rate. What is holding these students accountable to
attend school and ﬁnish? Intrinsic motivation is a major factor in that, but research
has been gathered that shows among online college students there is not necessarily
a higher dropout rate or lower success rate through online education than traditional
students. (http://www.aabri.com/manuscripts/11761.pdf)
By creating a support network, students will be able to get the help, or the extra
little push, they need to complete assignments. This is also key to identifying “high
risk” students that need academic and/or emotional intervention.
…intrusive academic advising or more personal contact with the instructor, whether that is
face-to-face, or electronically through online chat, texting, or discussion boards, may be
critical to the continued success of students with marginal cumulative GPAs, regardless of
course delivery mode chosen.
—Research in Higher Education Journal
While some students may already have the intrinsic motivation to pursue
knowledge on their own, there is a part of the student population that does need
more guidance and assistance in learning how to gather information. By using the
network of teachers and mentors, students can have access to an adult that can help
motivate them to get assignments done, complete projects within the deadline or
even just as a motivator to explore other subjects and material.
It is my hope that by combining these elements, students will have truly equal
access to a wealth of information without being forced to attend a school based on
their income or where they live. This is a revolutionary idea not because it is online
education but because for the ﬁrst time, we will be able to combine modern edu-
cation methods with local communities to create an interactive education experi-
ence that has not really been offered before. I believe that through a combination of
390
A. Donaldson

online and experiential education, one on one teaching and mentoring, and project
based alternative assessments; Bolder Super School will be able to teach all our
students how to be life-long learners, and active global citizens.

Transﬁgurism: Glimpse into a Future
of Religion as Exempliﬁed by Religious
Transhumanists
Lincoln Cannon
19.1
Future of Religion and Religions of the Future
What is the future of religion? Some expect the resurgence and ultimate triumph of
this or that fundamentalism. Some expect the religious phenomenon itself to
weaken and die, a casualty to the science of our day. Others, observing the history
of religion, expect that it will continue to evolve, inextricably connected to and yet
clearly distinct from its past. If such an evolution occurs, what will religions of the
future be like?
For that matter, what will humans of the future be like? It would seem relatively
unproﬁtable to speculate about religions of the future without taking into consid-
eration their adherents. Like with religion, some idealize a particular human form
and function and expect it to persist indeﬁnitely, while some expect eventual human
extinction through natural or artiﬁcial disaster. Others project our evolutionary
history into the future, and recognize that, as there was a time when our ancestors
were prehuman, there may be a time when our descendants will be posthuman, as
different from us in form and function as we are now different from our prehuman
ancestors.
If evolution were random, one speculation about the future of human and reli-
gious evolution would be as probable as another, but evolution is not random.
Variation through mutation may be random. But evolution is determined through
selection of variations that replicate within the constraints and across the possibility
space of their environment [1]. So evolution is also predictable [2]. To the extent we
know environment, we can predict evolution; and to the extent we can set envi-
ronment, we can direct evolution. In other words, we can predict and direct our own
evolution to the extent we can know and set our own environment.

Transhumanists advocate the ethical use of technology to direct our own evo-
lution. As humanists in the broadest sense, Transhumanists generally emphasize the
value of humanity; however, Transhumanists also recognize an essential dynamism
in humanity and value that which we may become at least as much as that which we
are. Many Transhumanists envision a future of abundant energy, molecular man-
ufacturing, indeﬁnite lifespans, enhanced intelligence, and overall radical ﬂour-
ishing. Although most are non-religious, a signiﬁcant and growing minority of
Transhumanists are religious [3].
Transﬁgurists are religious Transhumanists. The term “transﬁgurism” denotes
advocacy for change in form. It also alludes to sacred stories from many religious
traditions. Those include the Universal Form of Krishna in Hinduism (Bhagavad
Gita 11), the Radiant Face of Moses in Judaism (Exodus 34: 29–35), the
Awakening of Gautama Buddha in Buddhism (Maha-parinibbana Sutta 4: 47–51),
the Transﬁguration of Jesus Christ and the Rapture in Christianity (Mark 9: 1–10,
and 1 Corinthians 15: 45–55), and the Translation of the Three Nephites and the
Day of Transﬁguration in Mormonism (3 Nephi 28, and Doctrine and Covenants
63: 20–21).
Unlike some religious persons, Transﬁgurists generally share with non-religious
Transhumanists the hope that we can make our dreams come true in this world, and
trust that science and technology are among the means for doing so. However, in
contrast to non-religious Transhumanists, Transﬁgurists generally regard religion as
a powerful social technology that, like all other technologies, we should use ethi-
cally, mitigating risks and pursuing opportunities, to set our environment and direct
our evolution.
One of the most proﬁtable ways to start imagining the future of religion, reli-
gions of the future, and how they will evolve along with us, may be to consider the
ideas and practices of Transﬁgurists. What does religion look like through our eyes,
given lenses colored by expectations of directed evolution and emerging technol-
ogy? Such vision seems more likely to approximate probable futures for main-
stream religions than do others that reject, ignore, or lack substantial familiarity
with these powerful forces.
Assuming we and our religions will continue to evolve together with increasing
intentionality made possible by technology, it seems reasonable to suppose that
Transﬁgurism, more than any other contemporary religious view, is positioned to
glimpse into a future of religion.
19.2
Theology
Trust in superhuman potential is the essence of Transhumanism.
As Transhumanists, we trust that humanity can evolve into superhumanity,
perhaps to attain unprecedented degrees of vitality, intelligence, cooperation, and
creativity. This trust is not uncritical or passive. Most of us would aim our
extrapolations from observable technological trends into futures consistent with
396
L. Cannon

contemporary science. And many of us would act pragmatically to hasten oppor-
tunities and mitigate risks associated with such futures. So Transhumanist trust in
superhuman potential is best characterized as critical and active, but it must remain
admittedly a trust. The possibility of such futures remains to be proven.
Some Transhumanists also trust that humanity should evolve into superhu-
manity. We have minds to console and bodies to heal. There are communities to
connect and environments to sustain. Less austere, there are morphological and
cognitive potentialities to realize, and perhaps even meaning to infuse into other-
wise meaningless voids. Whatever its source, a sense of obligation impinges upon
us. And often those of us that most misrecognize our own moralizing have engaged
advocacy with a degree of strenuosity that would shame all but the most zealous of
evangelicals.
Although Transhumanists might conﬁdently deny accusations of superstition or
hubris, our trust is surely more than rational or ethical. Embracing a radical
humanism, we would dignify the ancient and enduring work to overcome and
extend our humanity. Diverse esthetics of superhuman potential resonate with and
shape us, affecting our thoughts, words, and actions. Even granting that we could
and should, perhaps more fundamentally, we want to evolve into superhumanity.
So we may trust in that potential, if for no other reason, at least because we desire it.
Whatever may be the reasons for Transhumanist trust in superhuman potential,
holding to that trust may have at least two logical implications.
First, if we trust in our superhuman potential, we should also trust that super-
humanity would be more compassionate than we are. Consider the social ramiﬁ-
cations of decentralized destructive capacity.
Logically, one of the following must be true: either (1) superhumanity would not
have more decentralized destructive capacity than we have, or (2) superhumanity
would have more decentralized destructive capacity than we have and mitigate that
greater risk without being more compassionate than we are, or (3) superhumanity
would be more compassionate than we are.
#1 seems unlikely, given trends in weapons technology. Weapons have
increased and probably will continue to increase in destructive capacity and
availability while decreasing in size and cost. #2 also seems unlikely, given
growing disparity between offensive and defensive weapons. Whether motivated by
utility or altruism, it’s already cooperation, if not genuine compassion, that protects
humanity from current weapons of mass destruction. And some contend that
nothing short of developing friendly artiﬁcial superintelligence will be sufﬁcient for
the challenges ahead. So that leaves us with #3. If we trust in our superhuman
potential, we should also trust that superhumanity would be more compassionate
than us. The only likely alternative seems to be that we will become extinct before
evolving into superhumanity.
The second logical implication of trust in our superhuman potential is: We
should also trust that superhumanity created our world. Consider the historical
ramiﬁcations of future creative capacity. Logically, one of the following must be
true: either (1) superhumanity would not create many worlds emulating its evolu-
tionary history, or (2) superhumanity would create many worlds emulating its
19
Transﬁgurism: Glimpse into a Future of Religion …
397

evolutionary history and we happen to live in a world superhumanity didn’t create,
or (3) superhumanity created our world.
#1 seems unlikely, given trends in information technology. Simulations of our
evolutionary history for research or entertainment are becoming more detailed,
virtual reality is poised to become prevalent, and neuroscience suggests the pos-
sibility of full experiential immersion in computed worlds. #2 also seems unlikely,
given the quickly growing number of simulated worlds. If ever many of them
become experientially indistinguishable from our own, it would be more likely that
we already live in one of many veriﬁed computed worlds than in one supposed
non-computed world. So that leaves us with #3. If we trust in our superhuman
potential, we should also trust that superhumanity created out world. The only
likely alternative seems to be that we will become extinct before evolving into
superhumanity.
The two logical implications of trust in our superhuman potential combine to
form the New God Argument [4]. The argument doesn’t prove God exists. Rather,
it proves that if we trust in our own superhuman potential then we should also trust
that superhumanity would be more compassionate than we are and created our
world. Such superhumanity qualiﬁes as God for many Transﬁgurists, and may
qualify as God in some mainstream religions. For example, numerous Christian
authorities have advocated various forms of apotheism or deiﬁcation: the idea that
humanity can and should become God, as or like God, or one in God.1
19.3
Epistemology
Transﬁgurists, particularly those with ties to the Christian tradition, may embrace
theories of knowledge that include a place for faith. In such cases, we tend to
characterize our faith as a practical trust in desirable possibilities when in context of

incomplete knowledge, rather than an irrational belief that contradicts reason. From
this position, Transﬁgurists may hold that science and creativity depend on faith.
This faith is not blind trust. It is only trust, with no more blindness than nec-
essary at a given time and place. Moreover, it is not dogma or any unquestioning or
unexamining attitude. Rather, it is recognition that no matter how many questions
we have asked, and no matter how much we have examined, we have always had
more to learn. Maybe that will always be the case. Whether we like it or not, we
expect to ﬁnd ourselves repeatedly in situations that require faith in practice.
Life and death hang in the balance, and we cannot wait for absolute answers (if
they even exist) before we act. Perhaps no philosophical movement has better
addressed such practical limits to knowledge than the pragmatists. As William
James once described it, you can stand in front of a charging bull calculating the
probability that it will trip, or you can run. Because we are limited, and to the extent
we are limited, we ﬁnd ourselves dependent on this faith, this trust in the efﬁcacy of
action given the knowledge at hand, according to whatever education or experience
we were lucky to have had (or at least presume ourselves to have had) prior to
needing it.
Furthermore, even when we have the luxury of time, it seems that we cannot
make epistemic progress without at least tentatively trusting in basic premises.
Science typically posits causality and uniformity as basic premises. Some may think
that these are proven by science, but that’s not so. As observed by the empiricist
philosophers, Hume and Berkeley, no matter how many times we think we have
experienced something, and no matter how many places we think we’ve experi-
enced it, it could all yet change.
Not even probabilities displace such reliance on faith. Can we prove our
memories were not planted in our minds moments ago by an evil demon? A Matrix
Architect? No. We cannot, even if most of us don’t worry much about that because
it’s not practical—or at least so we judge, based on our memories, even when we
recognize the circular reasoning.
The same is true of logic. We require some basic axioms and methods, taken
unproven, in order to do any work at all. For example, most logical systems assume
non-contradiction, and various operations for coupling, decoupling, and otherwise
operating on propositions. Logic doesn’t prove these axioms and methods. We
assume them.
Beyond the practical necessity, there is also a creative power in such faith. If the
universe (or the multiverse) is not ﬁnite, if real creativity and genuine novelty are
possible, it will not be those who wait for evidence that will be the creators—at
least not intentionally. It will be those who act, despite not knowing everything in
advance, that will be the creators. Such creative power may be seen in matters as
common as trust in the possibility of love. You can wait for a long time for hard
evidence that she loves you, or you can make a move. And sometimes the move
makes all the difference.
This practical faith is compatible with rationalism, even a pancritical rationalism
[5]. We can re-examine our premises, our assumptions, and our conformities.
19
Transﬁgurism: Glimpse into a Future of Religion …
399

We can honestly acknowledge the limitations of our knowledge. We can engage in
and welcome criticism. All of this, over time, may strengthen our knowledge, much
like the brutal hardships of nature have shaped human anatomies through billions of
years of evolution.
And all of this is an expression of practical faith. Karl Popper observed that
“rationalism is an attitude of readiness to listen to critical arguments and to learn
from experience. It is fundamentally an attitude of admitting that ‘I may be wrong
and you may be right, and by an effort, we may get nearer to the truth.’” Implicit in
this attitude of acknowledging our limitations is trust that we can overcome those
limitations. We don’t start with evidence for that. And even after much learning, we
don’t have ﬁnal evidence against a hard limit somewhere ahead of us. The effort to
continue, to remain open, to question and seek answers, operates on a kind of trust.
Certainly, it’s not a blind unquestioning faith against which rationalists would warn
us. Yet it is still faith of an anticipatory sort.
It’s also faith of a reconciliatory sort. Implicit in the rationalist attitude is desire
to share meaning with others, as broadly as possible. We might even characterize it
as epistemic compassion or scientiﬁc atonement. So we live and act, as best we can,
without turning to dogmatism, either of the sort that permanently ignores possi-
bilities or of the sort that permanently insists on them.
Accordingly, we would not agree with the proclamations of the Pope without
also considering research on the consequences of avoiding birth control. We would
not follow our feelings without consulting friends and experts. We would not
embrace the will of the people without investigating the feelings of the individual.
And the assertions of Islamic State would be only one, but still one, variable in an
aggregate of tensions and conﬂicts between and among our desires to share
meaning.
We would increase in knowledge, but intentionally in a manner that promotes
life, sustainable and genuine, compassionate and creative, rather than death and
nihilism. Knowledge is not inherently good or evil. We can learn as much about the
slide to hell, as we can about the ladder to heaven. Yet only one of the two
perpetuates our power to continue choosing between the two.
Some may feel that this understanding of “faith” is so unusual that it should be
considered a complete redeﬁnition. However, despite prominent competing notions
of faith, this alternative understanding is actually the kind of faith that some
Transﬁgurists have inherited from our religious traditions, learned as children, and
continue to feel resonance with while studying religion as adults. Some of us even
contend that the irrational or blind sorts of faith employed by others, particularly
Christian fundamentalists, are not faith at all. Rather, as the Bible puts it, faith
without works is dead (James 2: 20). To be faith and to remain faith, it must be and
remain practical.

19.4
Theodicy
For some computer programs, the engineer can know in advance how they will run,
when they will stop, and what results they will return. However, there are other
computer programs that are undecidable halting problems. For these, the engineer
cannot know, without actually running them, whether they will ever stop running,
let alone what results they will return.
Evolution may be an undecidable halting problem, inﬁnitely long and irre-
ducibly complex [6]. If we are living in a computed world, our world may be one of
many undecidable halting problems that its engineer spawned with variations from
parameters that have proven promising for some purpose in the past. One conse-
quence of this would be that the engineer simply cannot attain its purpose without
actually running the program for our world, evil and all.
For what purpose might the engineer choose to use an undecidable halting
problem? What possibilities might be worth running a program that the engineer
cannot fully predict in advance and would restrain itself from fully controlling along
the way? Although it may be impossible to know speciﬁcally, we can generalize
across the possibilities. They are, together, at least the possibility of engineering
that which is beyond the engineer’s direct capacity. In other words, the engineer
may want to make more engineers—genuinely creative agents in their own right.
Consider the paradox of artiﬁcial intelligence: on the one hand, an artiﬁce
dependent on its engineer; on the other hand, an intellect independent of its engi-
neer. Artiﬁcial intelligence is at once an extension and a relinquishment of the
engineer’s power.
Imagine the experience of an artiﬁcial intelligence, assuming as we do for each
other, that it has experience. Sensors feeding utility functions distinguish between
options, some more useful than others. How do the different options feel? Pursuing
the most useful options, the artiﬁcial intelligence inevitably encounters factors
outside its original calculations and beyond its power to control. It recalculates only
to ﬁnd the new scenario presents less potential utility than did the original. How
does that loss feel?
Perhaps the engineer should extend more artiﬁce on the intellect? Environmental
and anatomic variables could be controlled more tightly, commensurate with
greater restrictions on the experiential opportunity for both the artiﬁcial intelligence
and the engineer. Yet, no matter the degree of control, so long as it’s short of
absolute, the artiﬁcial intelligence feels options and losses to the full extent of
whatever may be its subjective capacity.
Should the engineer relinquish intellect to the artiﬁce in the ﬁrst place? Is it
worth the risk of suffering? Maybe the engineer’s own utility functions should stop
her from perpetuating her inheritance of feelings? As it turns out, humanity has
established an ancient and enduring precedent for answering such questions.
Persistent procreation, even at times and places where suffering has been more
prevalent than it now is for many of us, indicates that we (at least the procreative
among us) value the opportunities despite the risks. Analogously, the engineer of
19
Transﬁgurism: Glimpse into a Future of Religion …
401

artiﬁcial intelligence chooses a starting balance between artiﬁce and intellect,
commits herself to the process, and she engineers.
Likewise, as imagined by some Transﬁgurists, God works within the limits of
the possible to bring about our Godhood. God is the engineer, and we are the
artiﬁcial intelligence. We are at once an extension and a relinquishment of God’s
power. Confronted with the paradox of life, God values the opportunities despite
the risks, chooses a starting balance between artiﬁce and intellect, commits to the
process, and creates us.
19.5
Eschatology
Transﬁgurists have many myths and visions—many stories and dreams. And we
express them in many narratives. Often, they’re informed of an abiding love for our
religious and spiritual traditions, combined with deep hope in ecumenical inter-
pretations of those traditions that would reach beyond sectarian bounds. Of course
they also generally reﬂect an aspiration to account for contemporary science and
technological trends, even as we exercise imagination in an effort to tie everything
together.
Some of our narratives may be shocking, which is partly the point of con-
structing them, aiming to press each other beyond casual consideration. And of
course the only thing certain about our myths is that they’re wrong to some extent,
but perhaps the vision will provoke another’s imagination to improve on its
deﬁciencies.
Here’s an example, based on Christian eschatology.
Today, we are an adolescent civilization in the Fullness of Times. Filled as if by
an unstoppable rolling river pouring from the heavens, our knowledge becomes
unprecedented. Nothing is withheld, whether the laws of the earth or the bounds of
the heavens, whether there be one God or many Gods, everything begins to
manifest. And the work of God hastens. Repeating the words of Christ, we speak,
and information technologies begin to carry consolation around the world.
Emulating the works of Christ, we act, and biological technologies begin to make
the blind see, the lame walk, and the deaf hear; agriculture begins to feed the
hungry; and manufacturing begins to clothe the naked. Hearts turning to our
ancestors, we remember them, and machine learning algorithms begin to process
massive family history databases, perhaps to redeem our dead.
A biotech revolution begins. Synthetic biology restores extinct species, creates
new life forms, and hints at programmable ecologies. Some recall prophecies about
renewal of our world—or perhaps its destruction. Personalized medicinePersonalized
medicine begins to restore vitality to an older generation. Some insist that death is
necessary for meaning, but new voices repeat old stories about those who were more
blessed for their desire to avoid death altogether. Reproductive technology enables
infertile and gay couples, as well as individuals and groups, to conceive their own
genetic children. Some recoil from threats to tradition, while others celebrate gifts to
402

new families. Weaponized pathogens threaten pandemics, as well as targeted geno-
cides and assassinations. Meanwhile, solar energy becomes less expensive than any
other. And the Internet evolves into a distributed reputation network, creating new
incentives for cooperation. Missionaries ﬁnd their work more globalized than ever
before.
A nanotech revolution begins. Atomically-precise printing erupts with food,
clothing, and shelter. Welfare systems solve old problems and make new ones.
Among the wealthy, robotic cells ﬂow through bodies and brains, extending abil-
ities beyond those of the greatest athletes and scholars of history. Enjoying restored
vitality, many become convinced that we can vanquish that awful monster, death.
But cautionary voices call attention to stunning socioeconomic disparities. With the
ability to read and write data in every neuron of the brain, the Internet evolves into a
composite of virtual and natural realities. We begin to connect with each other
experientially, sharing senses and feelings. Spiritual experiences become malleable,
meriting careful discernment. Wireheading haunts relationships and burdens com-
munities. And weaponized self-replicating nanobots threaten destruction of the
biosphere. Meanwhile, robotic moon bases mine asteroids and construct space
colonies, reinvigorating the pioneer spirit.
A neurotech revolution begins. We virtualize brains and bodies. Minds extend or
transition to more robust substrates, biological and otherwise. As morphological
possibilities expand, some warn against desecrating the image of God, and some
recall prophecies about the ordinance of transﬁguration. Data backup and restore
procedures for the brain banish death as we know it. Cryonics patients return to life.
And environmental data mining hints at the possibility of modeling history in
detail, to the point of extracting our dead ancestors individually. Some say the
possibility was ordained, before the world was, to enable us to redeem our dead,
perhaps to perform the ordinance of resurrection. Artiﬁcial and enhanced minds,
similar and alien to human, evolve to superhuman capacity. And malicious su-
perintelligence threatens us with annihilation. Then something special happens: we
encounter each other and the personiﬁcation of our world, instrumented to embody
a vast mind, with an intimacy we couldn’t previously imagine.
In that day, we will be a mature civilization in the Millennium. Technology and
religion will have evolved beyond our present abilities to conceive or express,
except loosely through symbolic analogy. We will see and feel and know the
Messiah, the return of Christ, in the embodied personiﬁcation of the light and life of
our world, with and in whom we will be one. In a world beyond present notions of
enmity, poverty, suffering, and death—the living transﬁgured and the dead resur-
rected to immortality—we will fulﬁll prophecies. And we will repeat others, forth
telling and provoking ourselves through yet greater challenges in higher orders of
worlds without end.
As we share such narratives, expertly or not, we are engaging the function of
prophecy, not in any institutional sense that would usurp another’s authority, but
rather in the broad sense to which Moses aspired in the Bible, when wishing all of
us were prophets. The core function of prophecy is not fortune telling, and not even
fore-telling. It’s not about God or prophets telling us, “I told you so.” Instead, its
19
Transﬁgurism: Glimpse into a Future of Religion …
403

core function is forth-telling: an interactive communal work of inspiration, even
provocation, to steer us from risks to opportunities. At its best, it’s an expression of
persuasion and love, punctuated with serious warnings, aimed at our sublime
potential—and not some narrowly preconceived potential, but rather potential
openly imagined from a position of real compassion that would transcend itself in
genuine creation.
But to function with such power, prophecy must be connected, in our hearts and
minds, with living possibilities, even pressing necessities, and the urgencies of our
most vital moments. To the extent it matters at all, it’s because the prophecy reaches
into us and changes our thoughts sufﬁciently to change our words and actions—and
so perhaps to change our world. And to the extent that change is for the better, it’s
because the change connects us with the positive potential of our respective reli-
gions in a more substantial way: less escapist and more active, less supernatural and
more practical, less despairing and more hopeful.
Of course, in the end it may be, as some secular persons would suppose, that the
narratives of religious Transhumanists will prove to be little more than a curious
nuance in the history of humanity. Or it may be, as some sectarian persons would
suppose, that God will end up doing all the work despite our prophetic aspirations
or technological trivialities. But it could yet turn out that the grace of God is best
expressed in all the means at hand, from prophecy to technology. It could turn out
that it’s up to us to learn how to become Gods ourselves, the same as all other Gods
have done before. And that, for many Transﬁgurists, is a future worth trusting in
and working for.
19.6
Soteriology
Abstracting across perceptions of purpose among Transﬁgurists, and perhaps even
humanity on the whole, we might safely generalize to an aspiration for happiness.
We exist to have joy in the measure of our creation. For the Transﬁgurist, that
measure extends beyond present notions of poverty, suffering, and death. And in its
maturity, it surely extends beyond any egoism that would come short of imagining
worlds without end, wherein all enjoy that which they are willing to receive,
reﬂecting both their own works and grace beyond themselves.
We may play a role in and even feel a calling to extend such grace: to console,
heal, and raise each other up together. It is a desire for eternal reconciliation, with
each other and all of creation. It is a will to provoke each other to love and service.
And it is extended not only to the living, but also to the future and to the past. Turn
the hearts of the parents to their descendents, and the hearts of the children to their
ancestors. In its fullness, it is the realization that their happiness is ultimately
necessary and essential to our happiness. They without us cannot be made whole.
Neither can we without our dead be made whole.

Consider the long term implications of the historians’ project. One historian sets
forth a basic representation of a past person. Another historian improves on the
work, providing a more detailed representation of the past person. Other historians
repeat the process of improving on previous historians’ work, providing increas-
ingly detailed representations of that past person. If this process could be repeated
indeﬁnitely, the eventual consequence of the historians’ project would be a repre-
sentation of the past person that is sufﬁciently detailed to be practically indistin-
guishable from the past person. She would be resurrected. Either such resurrection
is possible or there is a hard limit to the historians’ project.
Imagine a superhuman historian. Using the tools of quantum archeology, she
traces backwards through time and space from effects to causes. Sampling a suf-
ﬁciently large portion of her present, she attains a desired probabilistic precision for
a portion of her past, and she generates you. The future-you is distinguishable from
the present-you, but no more so than the today-you is distinguishable from the
yesterday-you. You are resurrected.
Imagine further a cosmic posthuman mind. Her thoughts constitute creation,
conceiving worlds, gestating prehuman species, cultivating human civilizations in
emulation of her own past, and replicating new generations of posthumans. Her
memories constitute resurrection. From a distance, only a black hole, why does she
do what she does? Why should she care? Inside, she is a universe of reasons.
19.7
Conclusion
Some have charged Transhumanism with being a quasi-religious cult, to which
many secular Transhumanists have responded with denial, too stern, and revealing.
Transﬁgurists don’t hesitate to acknowledge spirituality, and even the religiosity of
a
strenuous
shared
spirituality,
at
work
in
Transhumanism.
Indeed,
if
Transhumanism substantially affects the world for the better, it will do so only
consequent to our practical trust in its esthetic and only to the extent that real world
possibilities beyond our own power align with that practical trust. Put differently,
Transhumanism will matter in a positive sense only consequent to our faith and
only to the extent of grace. Transhumanism, at least for the Transﬁgurist, is a
religious endeavor.
And indeed, the risks before us are too great and the opportunities too wonderful
to confront with anything less than that shared strenuousity, both sharply rational
and sublimely spiritual, which functions in all essentials as a religiosity.
Philosopher William James observed:
The capacity of the strenuous mood lies so deep down among our natural human possi-
bilities that even if there were no metaphysical or traditional grounds for believing in a God,
men would postulate one simply as a pretext for living hard, and getting out of the game of
existence its keenest possibilities of zest. Our attitude towards concrete evils is entirely
different in a world where we believe there are none but ﬁnite demanders, from what it is in
one where we joyously face tragedy for an inﬁnite demander’s sake. Every sort of energy
19
Transﬁgurism: Glimpse into a Future of Religion …
405

and endurance, of courage and capacity for handling life’s evils, is set free in those who
have religious faith. For this reason the strenuous type of character will on the battle-ﬁeld of
human history always outwear the easy-going type, and religion will drive irreligion to the
wall [7].
Too hardy to concede to antireligious fantasies, and too motivated to resist
technological empowerment, religion will surely evolve with humanity. And if
humanity will not become extinct before evolving into superhumanity, what would
stop religion from evolving into that which yet provokes such minds? Such minds!
Beyond our anatomical capacity to comprehend, their operations and motivations
must largely elude us. But maybe Transﬁgurists give us a glimpse into a future of
religion between here and there.

Gene Editing: A New Hope!
Christoph Lahtz
20.1
Genetics
When I was a little boy, my ﬁrst contact with Genetics was via my father, who was
breeding German Shepherds. I learnt very early in my life that traits can be passed
from the parents to the children and I was fascinated by that. Later on, inﬂuenced by
some superheroes background stories, I leant about the concept of changing these
traits in an adult organism—mutations. From then on I was completely hooked in
Genetics and read everything what I could get. When I was in the 9th grade I came
up with the thought, to put a nucleus of an adult cell in a fertilized egg with a
removed nucleus to clone the adult organism. I asked my biology teacher about it
and he laughed at me, that this would not work. One year later Dolly the ﬁrst cloned
mammal was born. These were the times where I grew up. Later on I studied and
made my master degree in Biochemistry and my PhD in Epigenetics and started
working in cancer research.
I am telling this to point out in what an amazing time we live. Twenty years ago
humankind cloned for the ﬁrst time a mammal and today we experience all these
biological breakthroughs. We will be witnesses of a lot of scientiﬁc breakthrough
we only know from science ﬁction movies. One of it will be the possibility to
change the genetic code at will to eliminate diseases or to gain new abilities and
traits. We will witness how gene editing will change us and the way being human
will be deﬁned.

20.2
CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Editing
The new technology of gene editing which appears in the media right now is called
CRISPR/Cas9. There exist others like TALENs for example, but CRISPR/Cas9 is
the most successful one at the moment. This method will allow us to repair
mutations in our genome which causes genetic diseases and many types of cancer
which are caused by mutations.
Cancer is a very disgusting disease, which is mainly caused by a dysregulation
of genes, which are very often mutated in their genomic or mitochondrial DNA
sequence. There are congenital and spontaneous mutations. The humankind is not
able to cure cancer on the DNA level. The humankind can treat cancer and a few
cancers can be cured, but we are not able to correct the mutated genetic code of
cancer cells, yet. Gene editing opens up this possibility, but we need to improve the
delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 protein into the cells to the affected DNA inside the
nucleolus to make it more applicable. I predict that such improved intracellular
delivery system is just around the corner.
20.3
Cancer and Disease Treatments
Once we mastered the delivery we can repair mutated cancer cells without affecting
the unmutated cells in adult organisms and have a real cure for cancer with a short
intravenous treatment. And it does not stop there. At that point we are able to hack
our genome and add and subtract or change genetic material in different parts of our
body. As the following we will be able to cure diseases like cystic ﬁbrosis or sickle
cell anemia, color blindness or muscle dystrophy. We can treat embryos even
before birth. I could imagine that we will see in the same timeframe an increased
use of this technology in athletic sport competitions. Gene doping will lead to more
efﬁcient oxygen usage, stronger, faster muscles and an extended stamina. In maybe
20 years from now it will be normal to change the genome in a genetic makeover to
have a new set of “in-upgrades”, like it is normal today to have a plastic surgery to
change the body appearance. Likewise in the same timeframe the progress of this
technology will lead to the possibility to negate the negative inﬂuence of micro-
gravity and space radiation in space exploration. This will lead to extended stay
duration in space and makes space exploration, living in space and other celestial
bodies much less harmful for humans. The possibilities are almost limitless. We
will be able to design and shape our bodies and abilities at will and need.
All that in mind, what beneﬁts gene editing will have to our health, our body and
progress the humankind has to be careful that all alterations, repairs and adaptations
we do with our genome do not reach the germline/next generation. Certain modi-
ﬁcations might be just in this time modern, but not in another. Some artiﬁcial trait
combinations could be harmful and might lead to loss of genetic variability. So we
need to keep our gene pool variable. Treating each mutation is counterproductive
408
C. Lahtz

and will lead to genetic conformity, which is not healthy for a population.
A subsequent genome hack in adults will be useful, but passing it on uncontrolled
to the next generation might cause larger damage than beneﬁt. So with all the great
visions we should give each human being the choice what he wants to change and
what not.
Another big beneﬁt of this technology could lie in how we see ourselves as a
species and what makes us human. When we are able to change our genome at will,
an artiﬁcial construct like “race” has no longer a place in the heads of the people
and society. When everybody can change the genome, there is no such thing like
racisms anymore. We will grow together like it should be. We are all humans no
matter what genetic background we have.
Gene editing can be a huge change for us to beneﬁt our species and grow
together but has also the danger to wipe us out. It will be on us to ﬁnd the ﬁne line.

The Future of Driverless Cars
Cyrus Shahabi
21.1
Navigation and Optimization
The future is here, or at least, a short drive away: Google’s driverless car prototypes
have proven feasible to release humans from the driving responsibility. Now, the
next question is, can we release the humans from the decision-making responsibility
as well?
For example, currently the human driver decides which route to take from a
source to a destination. Could we instead let the car decides which route to take?
This may seem to be a much simpler responsibility than the responsibility of driving
the car; however, it has a much more global implication than one may think. In fact
it opens up a huge opportunity. Let me elaborate.
Current navigation applications such as Google Maps1 and Waze2 focus on
optimizing for a single user—the driver—when crunching numbers to ﬁnd the
shortest or the fastest path. This is of course ﬁne as long as everyone isn’t using the
same navigation system or if they don’t follow the app’s recommendation. That is,
if the drivers are humans.
But once we replace the drivers with machines, they will deﬁnitely listen and
follow the recommendations. Hence, the cars and the navigation software will end
up playing catch up, with all the cars going where the software tells them to go,
which will then become the route that is no longer the fastest. Basically, the trafﬁc
congestion goes the same place that the app tells the cars to go! So where, you may
ask, is the opportunity?

411

The opportunity is that if we assume we can control all the cars (i.e., they listen
to our guidelines), then our navigation algorithm could optimize for network ﬂow
[1] instead of distance [2]. In other words, the goal is to maximize ﬂow in the road
network of a city. Of course, new types of algorithms are needed and they must be
customized to work at scale, i.e., handle large graphs (road networks) and millions
of users, while providing response in milliseconds. This adaptation to scale is not
easy and took the research community decades of research and the industry years of
implementation to enable shortest-path [3] or fastest-path computation [4] at scale.
Now the same should be done for network ﬂow optimization.
21.2
Solution to Trafﬁc Congestion
However, this new perspective on path planning can signiﬁcantly improve trafﬁc
congestions in major cities. Imagine a system that knows where all the cars are,
where they are going, when they want to be there and when they get themselves in
accidents. It may even know how an accident may impact trafﬁc and when it will
clear up [5]. For example, at the beginning of an accident, the system directs the
cars to alternative roads, avoiding the accident area, and towards the end of the
clearance time of the accident, it starts guiding the cars back to the area of the
accident because by the time they get there, the accident will be cleared.
Such a god-view of the city with all the past and current data can predict the future
and can control every car towards a better future, i.e., less congestion. In fact, the more
a priori information the system has, the better it can work. If you tell the system that
you’re planning to reach the airport tomorrow at 10 a.m., the system with very high
accuracy [6] can tell you when to leave and then it will make sure your car gets to the
airport when you need it. Connect this god-of-the-navigation to the social network and
your driverless car may even pick up a couple of your buddies on the way to the airport
as well. Now you can see why Uber3 is interested in driverless cars. Imagine the future
Ultra-Uber where your ride is there when you want it, before even you ask for it, and a
couple of your friends are in it as well, and the radio (or I should say Pandora4) is
playing the song that is common across all the passengers’ playlists.
In fact, the more “sensing” of the real world and the virtual-worlds, the more
effective the navigation-god will become. If it receives the trafﬁc-signals’ data, such
as when they’re red and when they will turn green, and for how long, it can better
optimize the ﬂow. In case of disaster, the navigation-god will avert your car, keep
the ﬂow away from the scene of the incident and evacuate quickly the cars stuck in
the disaster area. In sum, the global view of all the driver less cars will do much
better than bunch of human drivers optimizing selﬁshly. Seems like an argument
against the capitalist market economy!

21.3
Privacy and Security Issues
Of course there are several social and policy implications, not least of all the
privacy issue. In this brave new world, the navigation-god will know where every
car is. But before you get too tense, remember that Google navigation and Waze
already have that information to some degree.
Another social consideration is the dangers of giving up control to a software
system. What if the system is hacked? Or the underlying algorithm has an undis-
covered bug? Again, before your blood pressure rises too high, remember that air
trafﬁc control has been operating in a similar mode for decades and it has resulted in
less air accidents. Why not a ground-trafﬁc control for cars, with some human
oversight, but mostly handled automatically by the software. Of course, these are
key challenges which will require careful consideration by policymakers, but
programmers and software engineers have started including failsafe mechanisms for
their software, the same way that other engineers do for other infrastructures such as
roads and bridges. A related social issue is that in case of a problem, how the legal
system and the insurance companies should react. Can the system be sued? Is it the
driverless car that is making all the decisions, and what is the liability of the driver
(or should I say the passenger)?
21.4
Trafﬁc Infrastructure
Finally, it will be interesting to see how generally slow-moving governments adapt
to this rapidly-evolving technology. Would the city transportation agency be able to
feed high-quality data to the system to ensure its proper operation? Can they take
advantage of the system to design new roads or modify them? For example, based
on the system feedback, can a city’s transportation agency react quickly to change a
carpool lane to a toll lane? Or perhaps add new bus lanes or subway tracks to
modify traveler behavior and encourage public transportation vs. private cars to
improve the ﬂow even further.
The next 10 years will see this rapidly-moving sector take a sharp turn from the
pages of prototypes to the streets and highways of our cities. It’s up to our poli-
cymakers to make sure that driverless cars isn’t an industry that stalls or one that’s
left waiting for the red light to turn green.

Continuous Penetration Testing
Darren Manners
22.1
Penetration Tests
Everything seems to move so fast. What was secure today becomes the weak link in
your armor tomorrow. In January 2016, the head of the NSA’s Tailored Access
Program (TAO), Rob Joyce, was the main event at Usenix Enigma security con-
ference and talked about how the NSA goes about exploiting systems. He went
beyond the normal stuff like basic security (which some companies still lack) or
going after IT admins. He gave us a good insight into how highly funded advanced
persistent threats from state nations or organized crime think. He showed that these
organizations only need our defenses down for a moment. Those times when a
vendor asks for a backdoor or ports to be opened, or when an administrator makes a
mistake in a ﬁrewall. That’s all the attackers needs sometimes. In other words, they
are watching you all the time. Nothing new there. So why do we still only test once
a year?
http://fortune.com/2016/01/30/nsa-hacker-enigma-conference/.
I realized the limitations of point in time penetration tests years ago when, as a
penetration tester, I conducted a test and a month later the company was breached
with a new exploit. At the time, the exploit was not available to the public/
community. As the price of exploits on the black market increase and the real
reason to keep zero day exploits from nation states for either offensive or defense
military means continue we will see less and less cutting edge exploits handed to
the community. So while point in time penetration testing does a good job of
identifying risk, is it responsive enough for today’s fast changing environment.

If you drink from the security cool aid you will already know that penetration
testing is adapting with the rise of adversarial simulation or red teaming. These
terms tend to address the zero day problems by not worrying how a hacker got in,
but can the attacker be spotted and identiﬁed. The focus in these tests is on defense
in depth and detection. It is really a counterbalance to mimicking advanced attacks
without the need to ﬁrst break in. It tests the response of blue teams as well as all
that expensive detection equipment you have. But even this type of new testing
cannot see how our threat surface is evolving minute to minute.
The evolution to the world of continuous penetration testing was pretty simple.
I looked at what the hackers were doing with advanced bots and how they are
streamlining and automating attacks.
22.2
Continuous Penetration Testing
The continuous penetration testing can be “noisy” looking for low-level exploits
that would obviously alert detection tools and block simple attackers, as well as
using advance social engineering to mimic the known attack vectors via
PowerShell, Microsoft Word/Excel macros and other client side attacks that may
not be as noisy. It can even include as credential stealing campaign, using legitimate
access to circumvent detection. However our attacks can be removed from every
day alerts, as the defender will always know the source. We also add adversarial
simulation into the mix as well using advanced tools to test those internal detection
and blue teams.
The one major advantage to continuous penetration testing has is spotting those
mistakes or errors that may only be open for a day or an hour or two. As Rob Joyce
mentioned, it only takes a temporary crack. We can mimic this with advanced
automated bots. These bots can be individual or chained together to form super bots
to automate advanced attack patterns. It also gives a better return on investment. If
you test last week, how do you know this week you’re still good?
Now before I start the penetration-testing world on ﬁre (I can hear testers arguing
that this is sacrilege, that we are superior beings that cannot be automated—I
remember web developers saying the same thing back in the day though) I realize
that not everything can be automated. That is why our continuous penetration
testing service is a hybrid operation. At times bots are there to alert the analyst to
new potential threat vectors, other times its left to the analyst to use the most
important part of the test, their brain.
The main aim of the bots is to conduct everything that can be automated or is a
repetitive task. The human is the part of interpretive portion of the test or to conduct
something that simply cannot be automated. However, as time goes on, the more
intelligence we can put into the bots, the smarter they become.
416
D. Manners

So all we did was take best of breed products, a number of smart bots that can
adapt to environments, drop in a human analyst with the experience to understand
and be ready to interpret results and make them all talk the same language and run it
24/7 365 days of the year. So why hasn’t this been done before…oh wait it has, as
mentioned by the NSA, the bad guys are already doing it to you.

Autonomous Vulnerability Scanning

DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC)
In November 2014, Team DESCARTES led by Newton Lee and sponsored by the
Institute for Education, Research, and Scholarships (IFERS) was among one of the
104 teams registered with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA) for the ﬁrst-ever Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC). Only 28 teams,
including Team DESCARTES, made it through two DARPA-sponsored dry runs
and into the CGC Qualifying Event in June 2015.
We proposed a system—Distributed Expert Systems for Cyber Analysis,
Reasoning, Testing, Evaluation, and Security (DESCARTES)—that would be a
fully autonomous cyber defense system that is capable of autonomous analysis,
autonomous patching, autonomous vulnerability scanning, autonomous service
resiliency, and autonomous network defense [1].

23.2
Static, Dynamic, and Hybrid Analysis
for Vulnerability Scanning
During the DARPA CGC competition we have developed the concept of automated
vulnerability scanning system and implemented its prototype. Initially, our strategy was
to use asmany open-source tools aspossible inordertodetect vulnerabilities andanalyze
the compiled code. Generally speaking, there are 3 major approaches in the modern
“theory” of vulnerability scan: static analysis, dynamic analysis and hybrid analysis.
Static code analysis is an analysis performed without the actual launch of the
target software. Static analysis can be performed in many ways. The advanced
methods are based on code translation into an intermediate representation. First of
all, it allows you to apply analysis to the code written for different platforms and

processor types; secondly, it permits the use or integration of some common
open-source tools for static analysis (e.g. clang static analyzer, klee, miasm, etc.).
Dynamic analysis, on the other hand, is based on the actual execution of
the software program. The analysis begins when the program is undergoing ini-
tialization. It is enough to log all calls related to memory allocation and deallocation
to detect bugs like memory leak and vulnerabilities due to use-after-free and
double-free. Take double-free for example, the analyzer can memorize all the
previously freed memory regions and check if there are no attempts to free the same
memory regions again. In the case of static analysis, the detection of such vul-
nerabilities becomes much more challenging.
Another disadvantage of static analysis is that it is not always possible to create a
pathway to control ﬂow graph (CFG) and data ﬂow graph (DFG), which would allow it
to expose a vulnerable segment of the program. The main reason for that is the equiv-
alence of the NP-complexity task of a Turing machine halting problem. On the contrary,
dynamic analysis allows the generation of test cases that would result in the execution
of the vulnerable segment of the program code. The code coverage for vulnerabilities
detection is extremely important in the process of analysis because the wider the code
coverage is, the lower the chance of undetected bugs remain in the program.
Therefore, the so-called “Hybrid Analysis” based on the combination of the
static and dynamic approaches is the most viable one. Although the hybrid
approach is more complicated, it allows us to compensate for the shortcomings
of each different approach.
23.3
Intermediate Representation (IR)
There are many kinds of intermediate representation. Let’s consider the pros and
cons of the most popular ones:
1. REIL [2]—an intermediate representation language originally developed by
Zynamics as a part of the BinNavi project (the framework for binary analysis).
This language is based only on 17 different instructions, each of them having
three operands. The main disadvantages of this intermediate representation are
the lack of native support for signed multiplication, division and addition, as
well as the lack of the ﬂoating-point operation. In addition, the project website
hasn’t been updated since 2011 (i.e., the date when Google acquired Zynamics).
2. MAIL [3]—a specialized language of intermediate representation with the main
purpose of detecting obfuscated and polymorphic malware. Its main peculiarity
is the virtual processor with a simpliﬁed instruction set, which contains only the
essential instructions for malware detection (e.g., data transfer and conditional
jumps). Another peculiarity is the non-planar language that enables programs
broadcasting at the level of the intermediate representation. The disadvantage is
that the project is not open source, and it doesn’t support the translation of some
instructions that are essential for vulnerabilities detection.

3. Open Reil [4]—a new REIL version, written entirely in Python, is a convenient
framework that is most suitable for the use as a langauge with the ability to reuse
this intermediate representation to generate SMT-formulas for instance. The
disadvantage of this language in the context of vulnerabilities search, comparing
to that of the LLVM, is that its only function is to provide information about the
instructions semantics, and there are no other advantages for the vulnerabilities
search task.
4. ESIL [5]—an intermediate representation used in the project radare2. It supports
operations with integer variables, and all the expressions are recorded in Polish
notation. Its only disadvantage is that ESIL was initially created as a language
without a human-readable code representation, which could make the analysis
and debugging more complicated.
5. LLVM IR [6]—an intermediate representation based on the SSA with support
for calculations with ﬂoating-point instructions. Unlike the previous represen-
tations, LLVM IR is used in a large number of open-source tools as the backend.
The most interesting ones in terms of vulnerabilities detection are the clang
static analysis tool and klee. The tool developer’s community is quite large, and
there are “live” projects used by many researchers on a daily basis.
Supporting ﬂoating-point operations and symbolic calculations is very important
because vulnerabilities such as CWE-194 (Unexpected Sign Extension), CWE-195
(Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error), and CWE-196 (Unsigned to Signed
Conversion Error) are supposed to be detected. Therefore, several types of intermediate
representation can be eliminated right away. The best choice is LLVM IR—the most
developed language for intermediate representation underlying some of the tools for
static and dynamic code analysis, which will be discussed in the next section.
23.4
Overview of Open-Source Tools Based on LLVM IR
Here are some open-source tools based on LLVM IR:
1. KLEE [7]—is a symbolic virtual machine using llvm bitcode as a basis. Its main
purpose is the emulation of code blocks and automated generation of test cases
for the increase of code coverage.
2. Clang static analyzer [8]—a static analyzer of the program source code. It
consists of the core and checkers launched by the core for analysis. Currently it
includes many checkers that cover almost all the CWE from the vulnerability list
in the CGC binaries. However, CWE 193, 194, 195, 196, 401 and 409 remain
uncovered. The main disadvantage of the clang static analyzer is that it relies on
the source code instead of the llvm representation.
3. Mc-sema [9]—a tool which allows decompiling the binary code into llvm. Out
of all the similar tools including BAP [10] and dagger [11], mc-sema is most
suitable for decompilation. However, it has one drawback: the CFG source used
for decompilation must be either IDA Pro or mc-sema’s own python script. The
422
D. Gamayunov et al.

python script provides the 86 instructions support, which is far from being
complete, and its CFG quality is signiﬁcantly worse than that of the Ida Pro.
23.5
An Algorithm for Autonomous Vulnerability
Scanning and Patching of Binaries
Our concept of autonomous vulnerability scanning and patching of binaries can be
expressed in the following algorithm:
1. Convert the binary code into an intermediate representation in LLVM IR. This is
one of the most important tasks, because the rest of the algorithm depends on the
accuracy of the translation. Mc-sema, which requires some enhanced modiﬁ-
cations of the CFG generation script, was selected to be the conversion tool.
2. Use clang static analyzer to perform static analysis on the llvm ir. Clang static
analyzer requires signiﬁcant modiﬁcations in two areas: (1) Add new checkers
and improving the existing ones. (2) Create a proxy that would allow clang static
analyzer to operate not with the source code but with its llvm representation. The
second subtask is the most complicated one, as it pops up in clang mailing lists
from time to time; and there’s no stable public implementation at the moment.
3. Use a dynamic analyzer based on fuzzer, code coverage analyzer and KLEE, as
a test cases generator. Inspired by the ideas of ﬁleja fuzzer, we have fully
developed our own dynamic analyzer and code coverage analyzer. The main
task in this step is to decrease the number of the false positive errors.
4. Integrate the results from step 2 and step 3. The main difﬁculty of this stage is that
test cases may not be obtained in step 3 for all the cases of static analyzer output
from step 2. And, according to CGC, it is important not to increase the binary size
comparing to the original. Therefore, we collected some statistics on how often
each checker can generate errors. Afterwards, the threshold value was chosen.
Exceeding this threshold for a speciﬁc CWE type and the lack of test cases at
stage 3 would indicate that the static analyzer produces a false positive error.
5. Patch the binaries to remove all vulnerabilities while keeping the ﬁle size and
execution time about the same as the original binaries. During the CGC com-
petitions, we didn’t manage to come up with a universal method for binary
patching. Instead, binary patching was automatically performed depending on
the vulnerability type and the phase 2 results, using a set of heuristics. Let’s
review some patching examples. The easiest vulnerabilities for patching are
various overﬂow errors: stack/heap/integer overﬂow. They are easily patched,
because after phase 2 execution we have all the information necessary for
patching: vulnerable function, control ﬂow graph and data ﬂow graph. In the
case of stack and heap overﬂow, our approach was to detect the register (one
should mention, that CGC binaries were simpliﬁed comparing to real-world
binaries, so it was possible to conﬁne ourselves to registers only) in order to
determine the overﬂowing parameter and location to insert a check. For the
former, the DFG function is sufﬁcient, whereas for the latter, it’s necessary to
23
Autonomous Vulnerability Scanning and Patching of Binaries
423

map between the binary code and LLVM representation. However, one should
note that the graphs compiled of various basic representations blocks were
identical. Therefore, in this case it was necessary only to determine the desired
basic block and add a check to its beginning. And, in the case of integer
overﬂow, we did a simpler patching using safe functions of addition and mul-
tiplication to insert in place of ordinary assembler commands (the place for
insertion was determined by DFG). A more complicated binary patching is for
vulnerabilities of Use After Free type, which in our approach was patched only
with the assistance of pointer reset after its release; but we realized that only the
major options of this vulnerability type can be foreseen in such a way.
23.6
Changes and New Features for Clang Static Analyzer
Clang Static Analyzer has undergone major changes. We had to modify taint
analysis clang because ﬁrstly, it was implemented as a separate checker that did not
allow us to combine it with the proxy classes, and secondly, it lacks good arrays
processing. To establish interaction with a proxy, we had to implement the func-
tionality of this checker directly into the static analyzer core. Taint analysis of
arrays was done at the byte level through MemRegion class and the additional hash
table in it, which improved the possibility of taint analysis signiﬁcantly, as well as
added ability to detect new classes of vulnerabilities. Our changes also affected the
so-called “source functions” of taint analysis. Clang static analyzer does not provide
many “source functions” (for example, its number is much smaller than that of the
input functions in libc). However, in our case, the system calls to the
CGC functions were different from the standard ones, plus CGC used its own
version of libc, which provided some API for I/O. Therefore, we tainted syscall
receive() and API functions receive_delim(), receive_until() and read_until_delim().
The location of an API function was deﬁned by a signature.
We have implemented in our analyzer several new features to detect vulnera-
bilities when neither the ﬁrst nor the second operation phase of the analyzer
revealed any vulnerability. Firstly, we made some simple heuristics which could
look for speciﬁc potential vulnerabilities in binaries, and implemented heuristics
data combined with phase 5. For example, we analyzed the DFG regarding the
input variables; and in case of any arithmetic operations, we replaced them with
the safe arithmetic operations after each free () operation, and we explicitly nulled
the pointer which was used to free the memory. Secondly, we compiled the
statistics for a certain type of vulnerabilities present in regard to the binary size. In
the case of UAF and integer overﬂow, it allowed us to predict quite accurately the
types of vulnerabilities that are most commonly found in binaries that exceed the
median in size, and heap/stack overﬂow that are much smaller than average in size.
It’s worth noting that our new approach sometimes allows us to patch some
critical spots that would have been skipped over by the regular approach. However,
we must be careful because the patched binary may come out signiﬁcantly greater
in ﬁle size and slower in execution.

23.7
Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) Examples
Let’s review the analyzer operation, using the example of stack overﬂow vulnerability
type analysis in 2 test binaries from the CGC contest: 0b32aa01_01 and 3dcf1a01_01.
The vulnerability in 0b32aa01 is a simple stack buffer overﬂow in the function
checkPalindrom (sub_0804819F, Fig. 23.2), which checks whether a line—read from
stdin—is a palindrome. Reading takes place inside the function read_from_stream,
which will read the maximum number of characters that can be read or up to the
character‘\n’.Thus,themostbasicPoCexploitfor thisfunctionisasequenceofrandom
symbols greater than 64 characters in size. Now let’s see what the vulnerable function
looks like after its translation into llvm (clang engine notation is used for the output):
23
Autonomous Vulnerability Scanning and Patching of Binaries
425

One should consider another important thing: it’s fairly easy to understand the actual
size of local_arg_4 in this binary, and in general the number of local variables and their
sizes. Our translator does this by analyzing cross-references, dereferences and some
heuristics (e.g., compulsory alignment of variables on the stack). But generally
speaking, this is a very complicated task which should be solved through abstract
interpretation (for example, one can look at [12, 13]). In this example, the total size of
local variables can be determined from the disassembled representation, and hence they
are used within this function in the variable assignment operations and dereference
operations. Since the local array is only used in the operations of pointer assignment and
datatransfer,itiseasytounderstandtheexactlookofthestackframeinthisfunction.It’s
worth noting that these heuristics don’t work in general cases, and one needs a better
means to determine the look of the local variables in the stack frame of the function.
Since we have added receive_delim() to the list of the tainted source functions
and we know the exact size, the ArrayBoundCheckerV2 clang static analyzer can
easily cope with the task of detecting a vulnerability. In this case patching is trivial
as well (see Fig. 23.3).
Let’s consider a more complex example of CGC binary 3dcf1a01_01, which
also contains a vulnerability of stack buffer overﬂow. Unlike the previous binary, a
local buffer with the size of 0  200 is in the sub_ 080480A0 function, which calls
an internal non-library function read_ (Fig. 23.4).
Fig. 23.2 Decompiled view
of function sub_0804819F
426
D. Gamayunov et al.

In this case, the parameter 0  200 can be transferred to the function, even
though it’s used for initialization of the internal local variable, which deﬁnes the
boundaries in the read_ function. But in fact, the local variable is initialized to
0  7FFFFFF (line 22 in Fig. 23.5). This example illustrates the use of our
heuristics for patching the binary (the rest of the items in it are exactly the same as
in the previous example). In this instance, the checker ArrayBoundCheckerV2 will
show us that the assignment on line 43 in Fig. 23.5 may overﬂow the array. CFG
analysis may reveal that the assignments are made to the array only in two cases,
and only one of them is done in a loop. Therefore, it’s sufﬁcient to add a check
for the
overﬂow
of
the
counter
variable
according
to
CFG
(Fig. 23.6).
Nevertheless, this method is not optimal because it would be most appropriate to
change the assignment on line 22, but doing so requires a lot more work to improve
the automated patching process.

not among the ﬁnal seven teams to compete in the Cyber Grand Challenge at
DEF CON 24 in August 2016, we cherished the international collaborative spirit

We want to thank the DESCARTES team members Chris Barnard, Dennis
Gamayunov, Adrian Ifrim, Aaron Jones, Newton Lee, Darren Manners, Donald
May, Mikhail Voronov, Louis Wai, and Chad Wollenberg as well as software
engineering intern Diego Marinelli and multilinguist Inessa Lee.
A lot of progress has been made since the successful reverse engineering of the
Mac OS System 4.1 to run HyperCard on Unix at AT&T Bell Laboratories in the
mid-eighties [1]. In 2015, Google, Adobe, and MIT researchers at the Computer
Science and Artiﬁcial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) created “Helium”—a
computer program that ﬁxes old code faster and better than expert computer
engineers for complex software such as Photoshop [14]. What takes human coders
months to program, Helium can do the same job in a matter of hours or even
minutes. In August 2016, Mayhem designed by team ForAllSecure from Carnegie
Mellon University won the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge at DEF CON24. All
these advances are good learning experiences. However, the much desired quantum
leap will likely require the development of artiﬁcial general intelligence (see Chaps.

Part VI
Artificial General Intelligence
True Artiﬁcial General Intelligence (AGI) will be a ‘phase’ shift in the properties of
civilization. No longer will we be the smartest intelligence the Earth has ever
known. It will mean potentially huge shifts in what we can accomplish. When
thinking about what true AGI means for humanity, one needs to understand how
and what motivates that AGI. Do we even know? Is there any way for us to predict
what will happen once there is a machine intelligence that is beyond human ability?
Will it be like us? Will it be friendly to us? These are all questions to be considered
by humanity as we get closer to making the goal of AGI real. Setting aside the
implications of AGI, to make it real we need to build and we have a lot of work
to-do but it could be closer than one might think.
The following three chapters are about one possible solution to designing and
building an AGI called the Independent Core Observer Model which is an engi-
neering design pattern, or cognitive extension architecture, developed by a privately
funded research project which I manage. These three chapters are designed to
explain elements of ICOM so that subsequent chapters focused on study results or
algorithms can just reference these to explain the fundamentals of ICOM based
systems.

Introduction to Artiﬁcial General Intelligence
The road to building artiﬁcial general intelligence (AGI) is not just very complex
but the most complex task computer scientists have tried to solve. While over the
last 30+ years a great amount of work has been done, much of that work has been
narrow from an application standpoint or has been purely theoretical and much of
that work has been focused on elements of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) such as image
pattern recognition or speech analysis. The trick in these sorts of tasks is under-
standing in ‘context’; which is a key part of true artiﬁcial general intelligence but
it’s not the only issue. This chapter does not focus on the problem of context and
pattern recognition but on the problem of self-motivating computational systems, or
rather of assigning value and emergent qualities because of that trait. It is the
articulation of a theory for building a system that has its own ‘feelings’ and can
decide for its self if it likes this art or that art or it will try to do this task or that task
and can be entirely independent.
Note: Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence exhibited by machines or software. It is
also the name of the academic ﬁeld of study which studies how to create computers and
computer software that are capable of intelligent behavior. Major AI researchers and
textbooks deﬁne this ﬁeld as “the study and design of intelligent agents”, in which an
intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize
its chances of success. John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1955, deﬁnes it as “the
science and engineering of making intelligent machines”. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Artiﬁcial_intelligence
Note: Artiﬁcial general intelligence (AGI) is the intelligence of a machine that could
successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can. It is a primary goal of
artiﬁcial intelligence research and an important topic for science ﬁction writers and

futurists. Artiﬁcial general intelligence is also referred to as “strong AI”, “full AI” or as the
ability to perform “general intelligent action”. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artiﬁcial_
general_intelligence
Let us look at the thesis statement for this chapter;
Regardless of the standard cognitive architecture used to produce the ‘under-
standing’ of a thing in context, the following architecture supports assigning value
to that context in a computer system that is self-modifying based on those value
based assessments, albeit indirectly, where the system’s ability to be self-aware is
an emergent quality of the system based on the ICOM emotional architecture.
Note: The term ‘Context’ refers to the framework for deﬁning a given object or thing wither
abstract in nature, an idea or noun of some sort. When discussion for example a pencil, it is
the context in which the idea of the pencil sits that makes and provides meaning to the
discussion of the pencil save in the abstract and even then we have the ‘abstract’ idea which
is itself ‘context’ in which to discuss the pencil.
Note: “is the capacity for introspection and the ability to recognize one’s self as an indi-
vidual separate from the environment and other individuals. It is not to be confused with the
consciousness in the sense of qualia. While consciousness is a term given to being aware of
one’s environment and body and lifestyle, self- is the recognition of that awareness.” [1]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness
Note: A cognitive architecture is a hypothesis about the ﬁxed structures that provide a
mind, whether in natural or artiﬁcial systems, and how they work together – in conjunction
with knowledge and skills embodied within the architecture – to yield intelligent behavior
in a diversity of complex environments.http://cogarch.ict.usc.edu/
In computer science and software engineering there is a complex set of terms and
acronyms that mean any number of things depending on the audience in the tech
sector. Further, in some cases, the same acronyms mean different things in different
circles and often in those circles people have a different understanding of terms that
should mean the same thing and the individuals believe they know what each other
are talking about, but in the end they were thinking different things with various but
critical differences in the meanings of those terms. To offset that problem to some
degree, I have articulated a few deﬁnitions in a glossary at the end of this chapter, as
I understand them; so that, in the context of this chapter, one can refer back to these
terms as a basis for understanding. While at the end of the chapter there is a
glossary, the most critical term needed to be able to approach the subject in detail
under this pattern is ‘context’.
The term ‘Context’ in this chapter refers to the framework for deﬁning an object,
such as an idea or noun of some sort and the environment in which that thing should
be understood. When discussing for example a pencil, it is the context in which the
idea of the pencil sits that makes and provides meaning to the discussion of the
pencil, save in the abstract, and even then we have the ‘abstract’ idea that is itself
‘context’ in which to discuss the pencil.
To better understand the idea of context, think of a pencil being used by an artist
vs a pencil being used by a student. It is the ‘used by an artist’ versus ‘used by a
student’ that is an example of ‘context’ which is important in terms of
434
D.J. Kelley

understanding the pencil and its current state. Using ICOM it is the assigning of
value to context or two elements in a given context as they related to one another
that is key to understanding the ICOM theory as a Cognitive Extension Architecture
or over all architecture for an AGI system.
24.2
Understanding the Problem
Solving ‘Strong’ AI or AGI (Artiﬁcial General Intelligence) is the most important
(or at least the hardest) Computer Science problem in the history of computing
beyond getting computers working to begin with. That being the case though, it is
only incidental to the discussion here. The problem is to solve or create human like
cognition in a software system sufﬁciently able to self-motivate and take inde-
pendent action on that motivation and to further modify actions based on
self-modiﬁed needs and desires over time.
Note: A theoretical construct used to explain behavior. It represents the reasons for people’s
actions, desires, and needs. Motivation can also be deﬁned as one’s direction to behavior, or
what causes a person to want to repeat a behavior and vice versa. In the context of ICOM:
The act of having a desire to take action of some kind, to be therefore ‘motivated’ to take
such action, where self-motivation is the act of creating one’s own desire to take a given
action or set of actions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation
There are really two elements to the problem; one of decomposition, for example
pattern recognition, including context or situational awareness and one of
self-motivation or what to do with things once a system has that ‘context’ problem
addressed and value judgements placed on them. That second part is the main focus
of the ICOM Cognitive Extension architecture.
Going back to the thesis or the ‘theory’ or approach for ICOM;
The human mind is a software abstraction system (meaning the part that is
self-aware is an emergent software system and not hard coded on to its substrate)
running on a biological computer. The mind can be looked at as a system that uses a
system of emotions to represent current emotional states in the mind, as well as
needs and associated context based on input, where the mind evaluates them based
on various emotional structures and value assignments and then modiﬁes the
underlying values as per input; denoted by associated context as decomposed in the
process of decomposition and identiﬁcation of data in context. Setting aside the
complex neural network and related subsystems that generate pattern recognition
and other contextual systems in the human mind, it is possible to build a software
system that uses a model that would, or could, continuously ‘feel’ and modify those
feelings like the human mind but based on an abstracted software system running
on another computing substrate. That system for example could use for example a
“ﬂoating point” value to represent current emotional states on multiple emotional
vectors, including needs as well as associated context to emotional states based on
input, and then evaluate them based on these emotional structures and values
assignments; therefore modifying the underlying values as per input as denoted by
24
Self-Motivating Computational System Cognitive Architecture: An Introduction
435

associated context from the decomposition process. In which case, given sufﬁcient
complexity, it is possible to build a system that is self-aware and self-motivating as
well as self-modifying.
24.3
Relationship with the Standard Concepts
of Cognitive Architecture
Cognition can be deﬁned as the mental process of collecting knowledge and
understanding through thought, experience and senses [2]. Further in the process of
designing a machine that is intelligent, it is important to build an ‘architecture’ for
how you are going to go about building said machine. Cognitive Architecture is a
given hypothesis for how one would build a mind that enables the mental process of
collecting knowledge and understanding through thought, experience and senses [3].
So then how does the ICOM methodology or hypothesis apply, or relate, to the
standard concepts of Cognitive Architecture? In my experience, most cognitive
architecture such as Sigma [4] is really a bottom up architecture focused on the
smallest details of what we have the technology and understanding to look at and do
to build from the ground up based on some model. In such systems, typically, they
are evaluated based on their behavior. ICOM is a ‘Cognitive Architecture’ focused
on the highest level down. Meaning ICOM is focused on how a mind says to itself,
“I exist and I feel good about that”. ICOM in its current form is not focused on the
nuance of decomposing a given set of sensory input but really on what happens to
that input after its evaluated, broken down and reﬁned or ‘comprehended’ and ready
to decide how ‘it’ (being an ICOM implementation) feels about it.
From a traditional AGI Architecture standpoint, ICOM approaches the problem
of AGI from the other direction then what is typical, and in that regard ICOM may
seem more like an overall control system for AGI Architecture. In fact, in the
overall ICOM model a system like Tensor Flow [4] is a key part of ICOM for
preforming a key task of cognition around bringing sensory input into the system
through what, in the ICOM model, is referred to as the ‘context’ engine in which
most AGI architectural systems can be applied to this functionality in an ICOM
implementation.
Regardless of the fact that ICOM is a top down approach to AGI Architecture,
the “thoughts” themselves are an emergent phenomenon of the process of emotional
evaluation in the system. Let’s see how in the next section.
24.4
Emergent by Design
The Independent Core Observer Model (ICOM) contends that consciousness is a
high level abstraction. And further, that consciousness is based on emotional
context assignments evaluated based on other emotions related to the context of any
436
D.J. Kelley

given input or internal topic. These evaluations are related to needs and other
emotional values such as interests which are themselves emotions and used as the
basis for ‘value’; which drives interest and action which, in turn, creates the
emergent effect of a conscious mind. The major complexity of the system then is
the abstracted subconscious and related systems of a mind executing on the
nuanced details of any physical action without the conscious mind dealing with
direct details. Our ability to do this kind of decomposition is already approaching
mastery in terms of the state of the art in technology to generate context from data;
or at least we are far enough along to know we have effectively solved the problem
if not having it completely mastered at this time.
Note: The state or quality of awareness, or, of being aware of an external object or
something within oneself. It has been deﬁned as: sentience, awareness, subjectivity, the
ability to experience or to feel, wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood, and the executive
control system of the mind. Despite the difﬁculty in deﬁnition, many philosophers believe
that there is a broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is. As Max
Velmans and Susan Schneider wrote in The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness:
“Anything that we are aware of at a given moment forms part of our consciousness, making
conscious experience at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives.” -
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness
A scientist studying the human mind suggests that consciousness is likely an
emergent phenomenon. In other words, she is suggesting that, when we ﬁgure it
out, we will likely ﬁnd it to be an emergent quality of certain kinds of systems
under certain circumstances [5]. This particular system creates consciousness
through the emergent quality of the system as per the suggestion that it is an
emergent quality.
Let’s look at how ICOM works, and how the emergent qualities of the system
thus emerge.
24.5
Independent Core Observer Model (ICOM) Working
The Independent Core Observer Model (ICOM) is a system where the core AGI is
not directly tied to detailed outputs but operates through an abstraction layer, or
‘observer’ of the core, which only need deal in abstracts of input and assigning
‘value’ to output context. The observer is similar in function to the subconscious of
the human mind; dealing with the details of the system and system implementation,
including various autonomic systems and context assignment and decomposition of
input and the like.
Take a look at the following diagram (Fig. 24.1).
As we can see, fundamentally it would seem simple and straight forward;
however, the underlying implementation and operation of said framework is suf-
ﬁciently complicated to be able to push the limits of standard computer hardware in
lab implementations. In this diagram, input comes into the observer which is broken
down into context trees and passed into the core. The core ‘emotionally’ evaluates
24
Self-Motivating Computational System Cognitive Architecture: An Introduction
437

them for their emotional effects based on various elements, which we will deﬁne
later, and then the results of that evaluation is analyzed by the observer and output
is generated by the observer to the various connected systems.
At this level, it is easy to conceptualize how the overall parts of the system go
together. Now let’s look at how action occurs in the system in which the ICOM
provides a bias for action in ICOM as implemented in the lab (Fig. 24.2).
In this, we see the ﬂow as might be implemented in the end component of the
observer of a speciﬁc ICOM implementation. While details of implementation may
be different in various implementations, this articulates the key tasks such systems
would have to do, as well as articulates the relationship of those tasks with regard to
a functioning ICOM based systems. Keep in mind this is not the complete observer
but refers to the end component as shown in the higher level diagram later.
The key goal of the observer end component ﬂow is to gather ‘context’. This can
be through the use of pattern recognition neural networks or other systems as might
make sense in the context engine. The Observer system, in this case, needs to look
up related material in the process of receiving processed context from a context
engine of some kind. In providing that back to the core, the observer then needs to
map that context to a task or existing task. If that item exists, the context engine can
add the additional context tree to create the appropriate models or see if it is a
continuation of a task or question the system can drive to take actions as articulated
by placing that context tree back in the que and have the context engine check for
additional references to build out that tree more and pass again through the core.
Additionally, the system can then work out details of executing a given task in
Fig. 24.1 ICOM model diagram
438
D.J. Kelley

greater detail based on the observer context from the core after that emotional
evaluation. In layman’s terms, this part of the observer model is focused on the
details of taking actions that the core has determined it would like to take through
that emotional based processing.
Now let’s look at the idea of ‘context’ and how that needs to be composed for
ICOM (Fig. 24.3).
In this model we can see where existing technology can plug in, in-terms of
context generation, image or voice decomposition, neural networks and the like.
Once such systems create a context tree, the input decomposition engine needs to
determine if it is something familiar in terms of input. If that is the case, the system
needs to map it to the existing model for that kind of input (say vision for example).
The analysis with that model as default context in terms of emotional references is
then attached to the context tree (a logical data structure of relationships between
items). If there is existing context queued, it is then attached to the tree. If it is new
input, then a new base context structure needs to be created so that future rela-
tionships can be associated and then handed to the core for processing.
Now let’s look at over all ICOM architecture (Fig. 24.4).
In this case, we can see the overall system is somewhat more complicated; and it
can be difﬁcult to see where the observer and core model components are separate
so they have been color coded green. In this way, we can see where things are
handed off between the observer and the core.

Walking through this diagram, we start with Sensor input that is decomposed
into usable data. Those particular elements could be decomposed any number of
ways and is incidental to the ICOM architecture. There are many ways in the
current realm of computer science to determine how this can function. Given that
the data is decomposed, it is then run through the ‘context’ engine to make the
appropriate memory emotional context associations. At which point, if there is an
automatic response (like a pain response in humans), the observer may push some

automatic response prior to moving forward in the system with the context tree then
falling into the incoming context que of the core. This que is essentially incoming
thoughts or things to ‘think’ about in the form of emotional processing. By
‘thinking’, we only mean emotional processing as per the various matrices to
resolve how the machine ‘feels’ about a given context tree. Actual thoughts would
be an emergent quality of the system, as articulated elsewhere.
The core has a primary and secondary emotional state that is represented by a
series of vector ﬂoating point values or ‘values’ in the lab implementations. This
allows for a complex set of current emotional states and subconscious emotional
states. Both sets of states along with a needs hierarchy are part of the core calcu-
lations for the core to process a single context tree. Once the new state is set and the
emotional context tree for a given set of context is done, the system checks if it’s
part of a complex series and may pass to the memory pump if it is under a certain
predetermined value or, if it is above and complete, it passes to the context pump. If
it is part of a string of thought, it goes to the context que pending completion; in
which case it would again be passed to the context pump which would pass the tree
back to the observer.
As you can see, from the initial context tree the observer does a number of things
to that queue including dealing with overload issues and placing processed trees of
particular interest into the queue as well as input the context trees into the que.
Processed trees coming out of the core into the observer can also be passed up
inside the core and action taken on actionable elements. For example, say a question
or paradox needs a response, or additional context or there is an action that should
be otherwise acted upon; where the observer does not deals with the complexity of
that action per se.
24.6
Uniﬁed AGI Architecture
Given the articulated ﬂow of the system, it is important to note that functionally the
system is deciding what “emotionally” to “feel” about a given thing based on more
than 144 factors (in the model implementation in the lab but is not necessarily always
true in simpler implementations) per element of that tree plus ‘needs’ elements that
affect that processing. Thought in the system is not direct; but, as the complexity of
those elements passing through the core increases and things are tagged as inter-
esting and words or ideas form emotional relationships, then complex structures
form around context as it relates to new elements. If those happen to form structures
that relate to various other context elements, including ones of particular emotional
signiﬁcance, the system can become sufﬁciently complex that these structures could
be said to be thought; based on those underlying emotional constructs which drive
interest of focus forcing the system to reprocess context trees as needed. The
underlying emotional processing becomes ‘so’ complex as to seem deliberate, while
the underlying system is essentially an overly complex difference engine.
24
Self-Motivating Computational System Cognitive Architecture: An Introduction
441

The idea of emergent theory really gets to the fact of the system’s ability to be
self-aware as a concept and that it is thinking is a derivative of its emotional context
assignments and what it chooses to think about. This is really an ultra-complex
selection of context based on various parameters and the relationships between
them. For example, the system might be low on power which negatively affects say
a sadness vector, and to a lesser degree a pain vector is associated with it, so the
system might select to think about a bit of context from memory that solves that
particular emotional pattern the most. It might continue to try related elements until
something addresses this particular issue and vector parameters for the core state
stabilize back to normal. Keep in mind the implementation of an idea, say “to plug
into charge” might be just that, “an idea of thinking about it” which is not going to
do much other than temporarily provide ‘hope’. It is the thinking of the ‘action’
which provides the best pattern match and, given it is an ‘action’, the observer will
likely take that action or at least try to. If the observer does execute that action, it
would be a real solution and thus we can say the overall system thought about and
took action to solve its power issue. The idea of this context processing being
considered thought is an abstraction of what is really happening in detail where the
computation is so complex as to be effectively ‘thought’ in the abstract. It’s easier to
thank about or otherwise conceptualize this way making it recognizable to humans.
It is a distinct possibility that humans would perceive the same type of
abstraction for our own thoughts if, in fact, we understood how the brain operated
and how awareness develops in the human mind. It is also important to note that the
core while it is looking at the high level emotional computation of a given context
tree, the ‘action’ of tasks in any given tree that are used to solve a problem might
actually be in that tree just not in a way that is directly accessible to the emergent
awareness which is a higher level abstraction from that context processing system.
What this means is that the emotional processing is what is happening in the core
but the awareness is a function of that processing at one level of abstraction from
the core processing and that being the case details of a given context tree may not
be surfaced to that level of abstraction until that action is picked up by the observer
and placed back into the que in such a way as that action becomes the top level
element of a given context tree and thus more likely to be the point of or focus on
that abstracted awareness.
24.7
Motivation of the Core Model and ICOM Action
One of the key elements of the ICOM system architecture is a bias to
self-motivation and action. Depending on the kinds of values associated with a
context, the system may take action; or rather the Observer component of the
system is designed to try to take action based on given context that is associated
with the context of an action. That being the case, any ‘context’ that is associated
with action is therefore grounds for action. The observer is then creating additional
context to post back to the system to be emotionally evaluated and further action
442
D.J. Kelley

taken. The complexity of the action itself is abstracted from the core processing.
The fact that the primary function of the observer is to take action is part of giving
the system a bias for action, unless extensive conditioning is applied to make the
system associate negative outcome with action. Given that the system will con-
tinually process context, as it has bandwidth based on its emotional relevance and
needs, the system (ICOM) is then designed to at least try action along those ele-
ments of context. It is here that we complete the ‘biasing’ of the system towards
action based on emotional values or context. We then have a self-motivating system
based on emotional context that can manipulate itself through its own actions, and
through indirect manipulation of its emotional matrix. By ‘indirect’ meaning the
emergent awareness can only indirectly manipulate its emotional matrix whereas
the core does this directly.
24.8
Application Biasing
ICOM is a general high level approach to overall artiﬁcial general intelligence. That
being said, an AGI, by the fact that it is an AGI, should in theory be able to do any
given task. Without such a system having attained ‘self-awareness’, you can then
train the system around certain tasks. By associating input or context with pleasure
or other positive emotional stimulation, you can use those as a basis for the system
to select certain actions. By limiting the action collection to what is possible in the
given application and allowing the system to create and try various combinations of
these actions, you essentially end up with an evolutionary algorithmic system for
accomplishing tasks based on how much pleasure the system gains or based on the
system biases as might be currently present. Additionally, by conditioning, you can
manipulate core context to create a better environment for the conditioning of a
certain set of tasks you might want in a certain application bias that you want to
create.
In the training, or attempted biasing, keep in mind that personality or individual
traits can develop in an implementation.
24.9
Personality, Interests and Desire Development
Very much related to the application usage biasing of an ICOM implementation is
the idea of personality, interests and desires in the context of the ICOM system. All
input and all thought further manipulate how the system feels about any given topic,
no matter what this input is, biasing the system towards one thing or the other. It is
important in the early stages of development to actually tightly control that biasing;
but it is inevitable that it will have its own biases over time based on what it learns
and how it ‘feels’ about a given context with every small bit of input and its own
thinking.
24
Self-Motivating Computational System Cognitive Architecture: An Introduction
443

The point cannot be overstated that the system at rest will continue to think about
‘things’. What this means is the system, with limited input or even with signiﬁcant
input, will look at things that have occurred to it in the past and or related items to
things it happens to just think about. The system will then automatically reprocess
and rethink about things based on factors like recently processed input or interest
levels; related to topics of interest or based on current needs and the like. Each time
the system cycles it is slowly manipulating its self, its interests consciously and
subconsciously as well as adjusting interests and emotional states slowly (note that
this is by design to not let the underlying vectors change too fast or there is a greater
risk of the system becoming unstable) over time through this processing.
24.10
Summary
The ICOM architecture provides a substrate independent model for true sapient and
sentient machine intelligence; as capable as human level intelligence. The
Independent Core Observer Model (ICOM) Cognitive Extension Architecture is a
methodology or ‘pattern’ for producing a self-motivating computational system that
can be self-aware that differentiates from other approaches by a purely top down
approach to designing such a system. Another way to look at ICOM is as a system
for abstracting standard cognitive architecture from the part of the system that can
be self-aware and as a system for assigning value on any given idea or ‘thought’
and producing ongoing motivations as well as abstracted thoughts through emer-
gent complexity.

Introduction to Emotional Modeling
Emotional modeling used in the Independent Core Observer Model (ICOM) rep-
resents emotional states in such a way as to provide the basis for assigning abstract
value to ideas, concepts and things as they might be articulated in the form of
context tree’s where such a tree represents the understanding of a person, place or
thing including abstract ideas and other feelings. These trees are created by the
context engine based on relationships with other elements in memory and then
passed into the core (see the whitepaper titled “Overview of ICOM or the
Independent Core Observer Model Cognitive Extension Architecture”) which is a
methodology or ‘pattern’ for producing a self-motivating computational system that
can be self-aware under certain conditions. This particular chapter is focused only
on the nuances of emotional modeling in the ICOM program and not what is done
with that modeling or how that modeling may or may not lead to a functioning
ICOM system architecture.
While ICOM is also as a system for abstracting standard cognitive architecture
from the part of the system that can be self-aware, it is primarily a system for
assigning value on any given idea or ‘thought’ and based on that the system can
take action, as well as produce ongoing self-motivations in the system to further
then have additional thought or action on the mater. ICOM is at a fundamental level
driven by the idea that the system is assigning emotional values to ‘context’ as it is
perceived by the system to determine its own feelings. In developing the engi-
neering around ICOM, two models have been used for emotional modeling, which
in both cases are based on a logical understanding of emotions as modeled by
traditional psychologist as opposed to empirical psychologist which tends to be

based on biological structures. The approaches articulated here are based on a
logical approach that is also not tied to the substrate of the system in question
(biological or otherwise).
25.2
Understanding the Problem of Emotional Modeling
Emotional structural representation is not a problem I wanted to solve indepen-
dently nor one I felt I had enough information as an expert to solve without a
lifetime of work on my own. The current representational systems that I’ve selected
are not necessarily the best way(s) or the right way(s) but two ways that do work
and are used by a certain segment of psychological professionals. This is based on
the work of others in terms of representing the complexity of emotions in the
human mind by scientists that have focused on this area of science. The selection of
these methods are more based on computational requirements than any other
selection criteria.
It is important to note that both of the methods the ICOM research have used are
not based on scientiﬁc data as might be articulated by empirical psychologists
which might use ANOVA (variance analysis), or factor analysis [1]. While these
other models maybe be more measured in how they model elements of the bio-
logical implementation of emotions in the human mind, the model’s selected by me
here for ICOM research are focused on ‘how’ and the logical modeling of those
emotions or ‘feelings’. If we look at say the process for modeling a system such as
articulated
in
“Properties
of
Sparse
Distributed
representations
and
their
Application to Hierarchical Temporal Memory” [2] such representation is very
much speciﬁc to the substrate of the human brain. Since I am looking at the problem
of self-motivating systems or computational models that are not based on the
human brain literally but only in the logical sense the Wilcox system [3] or more
simply the Plutchik method [4] is a more straight forward model and accurately
models logically what we want to-do to separate from the underlying complexity of
the substrate of the human biological mind.
25.3
The Plutchik Method
George Norwood described the Plutchik method as:
Consider Robert Plutchik’s psychoevolutionary theory of emotion. His theory is one of the
most inﬂuential classiﬁcation approaches for general emotional responses. He chose eight
primary emotions - anger, fear, sadness, disgust, surprise, anticipation, trust, and joy.
Plutchik proposed that these ‘basic’ emotions are biologically primitive and have evolved
in order to increase the reproductive ﬁtness of the animal. Plutchik argues for the primacy
of these emotions by showing each to be the trigger of [behavior] with high survival value,
such as the way fear inspires the ﬁght-or-ﬂight response.
448
D.J. Kelley

Plutchik’s theory of basic emotions applies to animals as well as to humans and has an
evolutionary history that helped organisms deal with key survival issues. Beyond the basic
emotions there are combinations of emotions. Primary emotions can be conceptualized in
terms of pairs of polar opposites. Each emotion can exist in varying degrees of intensity or
levels of arousal.—[4]
While George Norwood mentions earlier in his chapter talking about the
Plutchick method that it would be almost impossible to represent emotions in terms
of math or algorithms I would disagree. As you can see by this representation of the
Plutchik method it is essentially 8 vectors or ‘values’ when represented in 2
dimensions which is easily modeled with a series of number values (Fig. 25.1).
Now in the case of ICOM since we want to represent each segment as a numeric
value, a ﬂoating point value was selected to insure precision along with a reverse
scale as opposed to what is seen in the diagram above. Meaning if we have a
number that represents ‘joy/serenity/ecstasy’ the ICOM version is a number starting
from 0 to N where N is increasing amounts or intensity of ‘joy’.
To represent ICOM emotional states for anything assigned emotional values you
end up with an array of ﬂoating point values. By looking at the chart above we can
see how emotional nuances can be represented as a combination of values on two or
more vectors which gives us something closer to the Wilcox model but using less
values and given the difference it is orders of magnitude when seen in terms of a
computational comparison.
Let us take a look at Fig. 25.2.
As you can see we have reversed the vectors such that the value or ‘intensity is
increasing as we leave the center of the diagram on any particular vector. From a
modeling standpoint this allows the intensity to be inﬁnite above zero verses lim-
iting the scale in the standard variation not to mention it is more aligned with what
you might expect based on the earlier work (see the section on Willcox next). This
variation as ween here is what we are using in the ICOM research.
Let us look at the other model.
Fig. 25.1 Plutchik model
25
Modeling Emotions in a Computational System
449

25.4
The Wilcox Model
Initially the ICOM Research centered on using the Willcox model for emotions and
is still big part of the modeling methodology and research going into the ICOM
project. Given the assumption that the researchers in the ﬁeld of mental health or
studying emotions have represented things to a sufﬁcient complexity to be rea-
sonably accurate we can therefore start with their work as a basis for representation
I therefore landed on Willcox initially as being the most sophisticated ‘logical’
model. Take a look at Fig. 25.3.
Based on the Willcox wheel we have 72 possible values (the six inner emotions
on the wheel are a composite of the others) to represent the current state of emo-
tional affairs by a given system. Given that we can then represent the current
emotional state at a conscious level by a series of values that for computation
purposes we will consider ‘vectors’ in an array represented by ﬂoating point values.
Given that we can also represent subconscious and base states in a similar way that
basically gives us 144 values for the current state. Further we can use them as
Fig. 25.2 Modiﬁed Plutchik
450
D.J. Kelley

vectors to represent the various states to back weight and adjust for new states. This
then can be represented as needed in the software language of choice.
If we map each element to vectors spread on a 2 dimension X/Y plane we can
compute an average composite score for each element and use this in various kind
of emotional assessment calculations.
We are thus representing emotional states using two sets of an array of 72
predeﬁned elements using ﬂoating point values we also can present assigned arrays
on a per context basis and use a composite score of an element as processed to
further compare various elements of context emotional arrays or composite scores
with current states and make associated adjustments based on needs and preexisting
states. For example the current emotional state of the system by be a set of values
and a bit of context might affect that same set of values with its own set of values
for the same emotions based on its associated elements and a composite is calcu-
lated based on the combination which could be an average or mean of each vector
for any given element of the emotional values.
25.5
The Emotional Comparative Relationship
Given the array of ﬂoating point number declarations, a given element of ‘context’
will have a composite of all pre-associated values related to that context and any
previous context as it might be composited. For this explanation we will assume
context is pre-assigned. The base assignments of these values are straight forward
assignments but each cycle of the core (see the ICOM Model overview for a
Fig. 25.3 Dr. Gloria
Willcox’s Feelings Wheel [3]
25
Modeling Emotions in a Computational System
451

detailed explanation of ICOM and the core) will need to compare each value and
assign various rules on the various elements of the context to assign effects on itself
as well as conscious and subconscious values.
Logically we might have the set values that are the current state as in the earlier
example. We then get a new block of context and adjust all the various element
based on those complex sets of rules that affect the conscious and subconscious
states (emotional arrays of ﬂoating point values). Rules can be related to emotions
which includes tendencies, needs, interests or other factors as might be deﬁned in
the rules matrix applied by the core.
This gives us a framework for adjusting emotional states given the assumption
that emotional values are assigned to context elements based on various key factors
of the current state and related core environment variables. The process as indicated
in the context of evaluating becomes the basis for the emergent quality of the
system under certain conditions where the process of assigning value and deﬁning
self-awareness and thought are only indirectly supported in the ICOM architecture,
and emerge as the context processing becomes more complex.
25.6
Context Assignments
One of the key assumptions for computing the emotional states is the
pre-assignment of emotional context prior to entering the emotional adjustment
structures of the core system.
While this explanation does not address for example looking at a picture and
decomposing that into understanding in context it does deal with how emotional
values are applied to a given context element generated by the evaluation of that
picture.
As described earlier there are 72 elements needed to represent a single emotional
context (based on the Willcox model) given the selected methodology. Let’s say of
that array the ﬁrst 3 elements are ‘happiness’, ‘sadness’, and ‘interest’. Additionally
let us assign them each a range between 0 and 100 as ﬂoating point values meaning
you can have a 1 or a 3.567 or a 78.628496720948 if you like.
If for example a particular new context A is related to context B and C which had
been processed earlier and related to base context elements of D, E and F. This
gives us a context tree of 6 elements. If we average the emotional values of all of
them to produce the values of happiness, sadness and interest for context A we now
have a context tree for that particular element which then is used to affect current
state as noted above. If that element still has an interest level, based on one of those
vectors being higher than some threshold then it is queued to process again and the
context system will try to associate more data to that context for processing. If
Context A had been something thought about before then that context would be
brought up again and the other factors would be parsed in for a new average which
could have then been an average of all 6 elements where before context A didn’t
have an emotional context array were the second time around it does. Further on

processing the Context A its values are changed by the processing against the
current system state.
Using this methodology for emotional modeling and processing we also open
the door for explaining certain anomalies as seen in the ICOM research.
25.7
Computer Mental Illness
In the ICOM system the ‘core’ emotional thought and motivation system if any of
the 72 vectors get into a fringe area at the high or lower end of the scale can produce
an increasingly irrational set of results in terms of assigning further context. If the
sub-conscious vectors are to far off this will be more pronounced and less likely to
be ﬁxed over time, creating some kind of digital mental illness where given the
current state of research it is hard to say the kinds of and manifestation of that
illness or illnesses could be as varied as human mental illness. Now the subcon-
scious system is in fact critical to stabilization of the emotional matrix of the main
system in that it does change slightly over time where under the right extreme
context input is where you get potential issues on a long term basis with that
particular instance. The ICOM research and models have tried to deal with these
potential issues by introducing limiting bias and other methods in preventing too
radical of a result in any given operation.
25.8
Motivation of the Core Model
Given the system in the previous sections for assigning emotional context, pro-
cessing and assigning context elements that are above a certain threshold are targets
for reprocessing by being placed in a que feeding the core. The motivation of the
core comes from the fact that it can’t “not” think and it will take action based on
emotional values assigned to elements that are continuously addressed where the
core only needs to associate an ‘action’ or other context with a particular result and
motivation is an emergent quality of the fact that things must be processed and
actions must be taken by design of the system.
This underlying system then is thus designed to have a bias for taking action
with action being abstracted form the core in detail where the core only need
composite such action at a high level; In other words it just needs to ‘think’ about
an action.
25

25.9
Core Context
Core Context are the key elements predeﬁned in the system when it starts for the
ﬁrst time. These are ‘concept’s that are understood by default and have predeﬁned
emotional context trees associated with them. While the ICOM theory for AGI is
not speciﬁc to the generation or rather the decomposition of ‘context’ it is important
to address the ‘classiﬁcation’ of context. In this way any context must add qualities
that may be new and can be deﬁned dynamically by the system but these core
elements that are used to tag those new context elements. Since all context is then
streamed into memory as processed and can be brought back and re-referenced as
per the emotional classiﬁcation system pending the associated threshold deter-
mining if it is something of relevance to recall.
As stated elsewhere lots of people and organizations are focused on classiﬁcation
systems or systems that decompose input, voice, images and the like however
ICOM is focused on self-motivation along the lines of the theory as articulated
based on emotional context modeling.
What is important in this section is the core elements used to classify elements of
context as they are processed into the system. The following list of elements is used
as a fundamental part of the ICOM system for its ability to associated emotional
context to elements of context as they are passed into the core. This same system
may alter those emotional associations over time as new context not hither to
classiﬁed is tagged based on the current state of the system and the evaluation of
elements or context for a given context tree when the focus of a given context tree is
processed. Each one of these elements below has a 72 vector array of default
emotions (using the Willcox based version of ICOM) associated with that element
by default at system start. Additionally this may not be an exhaustive list of the
default core system in the state of the art. These are only the list at the time this
section is being written.
(i)
Action—A reference to the need to associate a predisposition for action as
the system evolves over time.
(ii)
Change—a reference context ﬂag used to drive interest in changes as a bias
noticing change.
(iii)
Fear—Strongly related to the pain system context ﬂag.
(iv)
Input—A key context ﬂag needed for the system to evolve over time
recognizing internal imaginations vs system context input that is external.
(v)
Need—A reference to context associated with the needs hierarchy
(vi)
New—A reference needed to identify a new context of some kind normally
in terms of a new external object being cataloged in memory
(vii)
Pain—having the most negative overall core context elements used as a
system ﬂag of a problem that needs to be focused on. This ﬂag may have
any number of autonomic responses dealt with the ‘observer’ component of
the system.
(viii)
Pattern—A recognition of a pattern build in to help guide context as noted
in humans that there is an inherent nature to see patterns in things. While
454
D.J. Kelley

there could be any number of evolutionary reasons for it, in this case we will
assume the human model is sound in terms of base artifacts regarding
context such as this.
(ix)
Paradox—a condition where 2 values that should be the same are not or
that contradict each other. Contradiction is a negative feedback reference
context ﬂag to condition or bias the system want to solve paradox’s or have
a dislike of them.
(x)
Pleasure—having the most positive overall core context element used as a
system ﬂag for a positive result
(xi)
Recognition—a reference ﬂag used to identify something that relates to
something in memory.
(xii)
Similar—related to the pattern context object used to help the system have
a bias for patterns by default
(xiii)
Want—A varying context ﬂag that drives interest in certain elements that
may contribute to needs or the ‘pleasure’ context ﬂag.
While all of these might be hard coded into the research system at start they are
only really deﬁned in terms of other context being associated with them and in
terms of emotional context associated with each element which is true of all ele-
ments of the system. Further these emotional structures or matrixes that can change
and evolve over time as other context is associated with them.
As a single example let’s take a look at the ﬁrst core context element that is
deﬁned in the current Willcox based ICOM implementation called ‘pain’. This
particular element doesn’t represent emotional pain as such but directly effects
emotional pain as this element is core context for input assessments or ‘physical’
pain however note that one of the highlighted elements in the ‘pain’ matrix is for
emotional pain (Fig. 25.4).
Fig. 25.4 Emotional matrix array at system start for context element ‘pain’
25
Modeling Emotions in a Computational System
455

On top of all of the emotional states associated with a context element they
themselves also are pre-represented in the initial state predeﬁned into the system as
context themselves. You can see that in this initial case we have guesses at values in
the matrix array for default values for each element which has to be done for each
predeﬁned context element at system start. This allows us to set certain qualities as
a basic element of how a value system will evolve in the system creating initial
biases. For example we might create a predilection for a pattern which creates the
appropriate bias in system as we might want to see in the ﬁnal AGI implementation
of ICOM.
25.10
Personality, Interests and Desires of the ICOM
System
In general under the ICOM architecture regardless of which of the two modeling
systems that have been used, in ICOM the system very quickly creates predilection
for certain things based on its emotional relationship to those elements of context.
For example, if the system is exposed to context X which it always had a good
experience ‘including’ interest the methodology regardless of case, develops a
preference for or higher emotional values associated with that context or other
things associated with that context element. This evolutionary self-biasing based on
experience is key to the development of personality, interests and desires of the
ICOM system and in various experiments has shown that in principal it is very hard
to replicate those biases of any given instance due to the extreme amount of
variables involved. While ultimately calculable, a single deviation will change
results dramatically over time. This also leads us to a brief discussion of free will.
25.11
Free Will as an Illusion of Complex Contextual
Emotional Value Systems
Frequently the problem of “free will” has been an argument between determinist
verses probabilistic approaches and given either case an argument as to the reality
of our free will ensues.
While we don’t understand exactly the methodology of the human mind if it
works in a similar manner at a high level like ICOM then, under that architecture, it
would strongly imply that free will is an illusion. For me, this is a difﬁcult thing to
be sure of given that this is outside the scope of the research around ICOM; but
none the less it is worth mentioning the possibility. Additionally, if true, then free
will seems to be something that can be completely mathematically modeled. If that
is the case, it is likely that of the human mind can be as well. Certainly, as we
progress this will be a key point of interest but outside my expertise.
456
D.J. Kelley

ICOM emotional modeling seems to be at the heart of this mathematical mod-
eling of ‘free will’ or what appears to be free will in a sea of variables that is so vast
that we collectively have not been able to full modeling but ICOM based systems
appear in function to exhibit free will based on their own self biases based on their
experience which because we can and have a model free will in ICOM is an illusion
of the sea of factors required for ICOM systems to function. Let’s get back to the
different methods used in ICOM for emotional modeling.
25.12
Plutchik Verses Willcox
When determining which method to use in emotional modeling we see a number of
key facts. Willcox models all the nuances of human emotions directly with
numerous vectors or values. Plutchik models those nuances through combination of
values thus using a total number of values that is much less. From a computational
standpoint Plutchik has 8 sets of core values where Willcox using 72 so having two
sets of those for conscious and unconscious values gives us 72 which converting
that to a 2d plain requires conversion X/Y values which means 144 trigonomic
functions for each pass through the ICOM core whereas using Plutchik we have 16
total values with the same conversion of X/Y values to produce the average
emotional effects applied to incoming emotional context means only 16 trigonomic
functions per core pass which means from a computational standpoint we only need
9 times less computational power to run with the Plutchik method which is the basis
for the research post series 3 experiments moving forward at least for the fore-
seeable research that is in progress.
25.13
Visualizing Emotional Modeling Using Plutchik
To better understand how any given instance of ICOM is responding in tests we
needed a method for visualizing and representing emotional state data and given the
method for modeling in either method articulated earlier we came up with this
method here for indicating state. This method visualizes graphically emotional state
of what is going on in the core. You can see we are visualizing emotional states
much like the earlier diagrams then in which we look at vectors that represent the
model (see Figs. 25.1, 25.2).
So let’s look as an example. In this case we are looking at one of the program
series 3 experiments in which case we were looking at ICOM introspection as it
relates to the system thinking about previous elements to see if the system would
pick something out of memory and then thinking about it and see how it affects
various vectors or emotional states. The rest of the experiment is not as important to
the point in which here we are showing how that data is represented. In this case we
25
Modeling Emotions in a Computational System
457

start with the following raw data keeping in mind here we are looking at only 4 of
the eight values modeled in the test system (Fig. 25.5).
So how can diagram emotional? First we need to understand there is a set for the
conscious and subconscious parts of the system and we use two diagrams for each
with the same vectors as noted in the aforementioned diagrams in particular the
Plutchik method.
Now if we plot the states we get a set of diagrams as shown in Fig. 25.6.
This graph system is simple to visualize what the system is feeling albeit the
nuances of what each one means is still somewhat abstract but easily to visualize
which is why the ICOM project settled on this method.
In this particular study we are looking at a similar matrix as used in previous
research but now we were introducing the introspection where we can see the effect
of the action bias on the emotional state. This particular study also showcases the
resolution that the system quickly goes to where we have subtle changes that are or
can be reﬂected by the system in a way we can see via this diagramming
methodology. In a working situation items are selected based on how things map to
interest and needs and how it affects the core state of the system.
Further given this and the related body of research we can see that even having
the same input out of order will cause a different end result and given the volume of
input and the resolution of the effect of retrospection and manipulation of interests
therefore no two systems would likely ever be the same unless literally copied and
then would stay the same only if all of the subsequent input would the same
including order. Small differences over time could have dramatic effects millions of
cycles later.

This nuanced complexity is why the diagramming method has become so
important to understanding ICOM behavior.

Summary
The Emotional Modeling used in the Independent Core Observer Model (ICOM)
Cognitive Extension Architecture is a methodology or ‘pattern’ for producing a
self-motivating computational system that can be self-aware where emotional
modeling is the key to the operation of ICOM. While ICOM is as a system for
abstracting standard cognitive architecture from the part of the system that can be
self-aware it is primarily a system for assigning value on any given idea or
‘thought’ and based on that take action as well as producing ongoing
self-motivations in the systems further thought or action. ICOM is at a fundamental

level is driven by the idea that the system is assigning emotional values to ‘context’
as it is perceived by the system to determine how it feels. In developing the
engineering around ICOM two models have been used based on a logical under-
standing of emotions as modeled by traditional psychologist as opposed to
empirical psychologist which tend to be based on biological structures. This
approach is based on a logical approach that is also not tied to the substrate of the
system in question. Using this emotional architecture we can see how using the
Plutchik method is used and how that application creates the biases of the system
and how it self evolves on its own making the exposure to input key to the early
developing of a given implementation of ICOM.

Introduction to Mind and Consciousness
A scientist studying the human mind suggests that consciousness is likely an
emergent phenomenon. In other words, she is suggesting that, when we ﬁgure it
out, we will likely ﬁnd it to be an emergent quality of certain kinds of systems
under certain circumstances [7]. This particular system (ICOM) creates con-
sciousness through the emergent quality of the system. But how does Strong AI
Emerge from a system that by itself is not speciﬁcally Artiﬁcial General Intelligence
(AGI). Independent Core Observer Model (ICOM) is an emotional processing
system designed to take in context and emotionally process this context and decide
at a conscious and subconscious emotional level how it feels about this input.
Through the emerging complexity of the system, we have AI that, in operation,
functions logically much like the human mind at the highest level. ICOM, however,
does not model the human brain, nor deal with individual functions such as in a
neural network and is completely a top down logical approach to AGI vs the
traditional bottom up. This of course supposes an understanding of how the mind
works, or supposes a way it ‘could’ work, and was designed around that. To put
into context what ICOM potentially means for society and why AGI is the most
important scientiﬁc endeavor in the history of the world, I prefer to keep in mind the
following movie quote:
For 130,000 years, our capacity to reason has remained unchanged. The combined intellect
of the neuroscientists, mathematicians and… hackers… […] pales in comparison to the
most basic A.I. Once online, a sentient machine will quickly overcome the limits of
biology. And in a short time, its analytic power will become greater than the collective
intelligence of every person born in the history of the world. So imagine such an entity with

a full range of human emotion. Even self-awareness. Some scientists refer to this as “the
Singularity.”—Transcendence [movie] 2014 [17]
Keep in mind that not if, but WHEN, AGI emerges on its own, it will be the
biggest change to humanity since the dawn of language. Let’s look at what
‘Emergence’ means when talking about ICOM.
26.2
Order from Chaos
When speaking with other computer scientists, ICOM is in many ways not cog-
nitive architecture in the same sense that many of them think. When speaking of
bottom up approaches focused on for example neural networks, ICOM sits on top
of such systems or as an extension of such systems. ICOM really is the force behind
the system that allows it to formulate thoughts, actions and motivations independent
of any previous programming and is the catalyst for the emergent phenomenon
demonstrated by ICOM ‘extension’ cognitive architecture.
To really understand how that emergence works, we need to also understand
how the memory or data architecture in ICOM is structured.
26.3
Data Architecture
While the details of how the human brain stores data is one thing we do not know
for sure; logically it demonstrates certain qualities in terms of patterns, timelines
and thus inferred structure. Kurzweil’s book “How to Create a Mind” [13] brings up
three key points regarding memory as used in the human mind and how memory is
built or designed from a data architecture standpoint.
Point 1: “our memories are sequential and in order. They can be accessed in the
order that they are remembered. We are unable to directly reverse the sequence of a
memory”—page 27.
Point 2: “there are no images, videos, or sound recordings stored in the brain. Our
memories are stored as sequences of patterns. Memories that are not accessed dim
over time.”—page 29.
Point 3: “We can recognize a pattern even if only part of it is perceived (seen, heard,
felt) and even if it contains alterations. Our recognition ability is apparently able to
detect invariant features of a pattern—characteristics that survive real-world vari-
ations.”—page 30.
The ICOM data architecture is based on the same basis that these points where
made. Data ﬂows in, related to time sequences. These time sequences are tagged
with context that is associated with other context elements. There are a number of
464
D.J. Kelley

ways of looking at this data model from a traditional computer science data base
architectural standpoint. For example (Fig. 26.1):
If you are familiar with database data architecture, or even if you’re not, you can
tell this is fundamentally a simple model and it could be done even more simply
then this. Notice that, while we have 3 tables, only two hold any real data. One is
essentially a time log, where each time there is a new segment a new table entry is
created. The other main table is the idea of ‘context’ which contains 8 values
associated with emotional states for a given piece of context. The third table holds
relationships between ‘context’. It is important to know that an item in the context
table can be related to any number of other ‘context’ items. Now, in this case, there
are 2 kinds of groups of searches that an ‘ICOM’ system is going to-do against
these tables, one related to time and the other to context. Referring to searches
against “context’ these can be further broken out into several kinds of searches too,
that is to get base context searches such as language components or interests or both
and then searches related to being able to build context trees based on association.
In particular, when we look at the scale of the problem regardless of the substrate, it
is easy to see that the beneﬁt of using massively parallel or even quantum searches
against that context data and any number of indexes is useful. Further, for those that
understand database architecture and database modeling, a number of indexes or
‘views’ would obviously be useful. In this case though, we could search just the
context table the hard way but, to speed this up, we can create reference tables, that
are used to hold the top ‘interest’ base context items or the top ‘base’ context items.
Note also that with such a technique, at a certain scale, this sort of indexing needs to
be limited regardless of the underlying technology. Having this sort of system
running on my Surface Pro 4 I might get away with having a million records in this
Fig. 26.1 ICOM basic entity relationship diagram (ERD)
26
Artiﬁcial General Intelligence Subjective Experience
465

table but something on the order of the human brain might have 15 billion records?
(This is just a guess, I’m just saying that at some point there is a limit) Using the
same database design methodology, you could visualize it like this (Fig. 26.2):
This still seems simple visually and fairly basic and even knowing that the two
main tables around time segments and context might have 100 billion records in
them it is still difﬁcult to appreciate the complexity of the data we are talking about
in an ICOM based system using this data architecture. Now let’s look at the data in
say the TimeSegment table and the context table related to properties where Context
is related to itself and to an individual time segment. Along the top are time
segment records and below those are individual context records and their rela-
tionships as they are related to additional context records (Fig. 26.3).
As you can see when looking at the records from this relationship standpoint, we
can see the complexity of the underlying relational model of said records. If you
just look at context records on their own, you might get something a million more
times complex but similar to this:
From this standpoint, it’s easy to imagine the sea of data that is in a large scale
ICOM system in the core memory or the ‘context’ table.
Now getting back to this idea of emergence, if you have studied chaos theory
[15] one may have heard the idea of the butterﬂy effect. The butterﬂy effect has
several ways it manifests in ICOM in the research that we have done; however, just
from a hypothetical standpoint given the previous ﬁgure, if I pick out just a single
node in that mass you can see how even a small change affects virtually everything
else. In the ICOM experiments done so far, even a small variance of the data input,
either in terms of time cadence or order, has always (thus far) resulted in major
differences in the system. In these experiments, as time progresses and when an
event with the same input reoccurs; we saw traits develop that deﬁne major dif-
ferences in the ﬁnal state of the system.

26.4
Emergence from Chaos
When we start talking about Emergence from the standpoint of system theory, we
mean some quality of the system that emerges that is qualitatively different then the
individual components or systems. It is similar to the idea that all the inanimate
atoms and molecules within a cell, when taken as a whole, work together as a living
system; whereas individual components are inert. It is a fundamentally ‘new’
property that emerges from a system as a whole. From this standpoint, ‘Emergence’
is deﬁned as:
A process whereby larger entities, patterns, and regularities arise through interactions
among smaller or simpler entities that themselves do not exhibit such properties. [16]
In the AGI generated by the ICOM architecture, we are talking about an effect
that is substantially similar. We see what is called a ‘phase’ transition when a
certain complexity arises in the system or a ‘strong’ emergence, which is also
known as ‘irreducible emergence’. In ICOM, it is not a quality of the substrate but
of the ﬂow of information.
In ICOM, we have a sea of data coming in being stacked in a stream of time into
the memory of the system. This data passes through what is called a context engine
that is very much like many of the AI systems, such as Tensor Flow, that take input
into the system, process it to identify context and associate it with new or existing
structures in memory using structures called ‘context’ trees.

If you go back to the example in Fig. 26.4, pick any give node and follow all the
connections 3 levels then you have an example of a ‘context tree’ in terms of
structure.
Now, as articulated earlier, all of these data structures are created in long lines of
time based context trees that are also processed by the ‘core’; which is the part of
the ICOM system that processes the top level emotional evaluations related to new
elements of context or existing context framed in such a way that it has new
associated context. In this manner, they are all evaluated. As those elements pass
through the core, based on associated context, new elements may be associated to
that context based on emotional evaluations. Trees are queued and test associations
pass through the ‘core’ and are restacked and passed into memory whereas the
‘observer’ looks for ‘action’ based context on which it can take additional action
and then the ‘context pump’ looks for recent context in terms of interest, or other
emotional factors driven by needs and interest, to place those back into the
incoming queue of the core to be cycled again. Action based context being a
speciﬁc type of context related to the system taking an action to get a better
emotional composited result.
In a sea of data, the ICOM process bubbles up elements and through the core
action and additional input you have this emergent quality of context turning into
thought in the abstract. ICOM doesn’t exactly create thought per se but, in abstract,
enables it through the ICOM structures. In early studies using this model, basic
intelligent emotional responses are clear. The system continues to choose what it
thinks about and the effect this has on current emotional states is complex and
varied. When abstracted, as a whole we see the emergent or phase transition into a
holistic AGI system that, even in these early stages of development, demonstrates
the results that this work is based on.

26.5
Thought Architecture and the Phase Threshold
The Independent Core Observer Model (ICOM) theory contends that consciousness
is a high level abstraction. And further, that consciousness is based on emotional
context assignments evaluated based on other emotions related to the context of any
given input or internal topic. These evaluations are related to needs and other
emotional vectors such as interests, which are themselves emotions, and are used as
the basis for ‘value’.’Value’ drives interest and action which, in turn, creates the
emergent effect of a conscious mind. The major complexity of the system is the
abstracted subconscious, and related systems, of a mind executing on the nuanced
details of any physical action without the conscious mind dealing with direct
details.
Our ability to do this kind of input decomposition (related to breaking down
input data and assigning ‘context’ through understanding) is already approaching
mastery in terms of the state of the art in technology to generate context from data;
or at least we are far enough along to know we have effectively solved the problem
if not having it completely mastered at this time. This alignment in terms of context
processing or a context engine like Tensor Flow is all part of that ‘Phase Threshold’
(the point in which a fundamentally new or different property ‘emerges’ from a
simpler system or structure) we are approaching now with the ICOM Cognitive
Architecture and existing AI technologies.
26.6
‘Context’ Thought Processing
One key element of ICOM that is really treated separately from ICOM itself is the
idea of de-compositing raw data or ‘context’ processing as mentioned earlier. The
idea of providing ‘context’ for understanding is a key element of ICOM; that is to
come up with arbitrary relationships that allow the system to evaluate elements for
those value judgements by ICOM. In testing, there are numerous methodologies
that showed promise including neural network and evolutionary algorithms.
One particular method that shows enormous promise to enhance this element of
AGI is Alex Wissner-Gross’s paper on Causal Entropy which contains an equation
for ‘intelligence’ that essentially states that intelligence as a force F acts so as to
maximize potential outcome with strength T and diversity of possible futures S up
to some future time horizon s [12].

Alex Wissner-Gross Equation for Intelligence
Given Alex’s work, if we look more at implementations of this, we can see from
a behavior standpoint that this, along with some of the other techniques, is a key

part of the idea of decomposition for creating associations into core memory. This is
really the secret sauce, metaphorically, to not just self-aware AGI but self-aware
and creative systems and the road to true AGI or rather true ‘machine’ intelligence.
While the ICOM on its own would be self-aware and independent, Alex’s approach
really adds the rich creative ability and, along with the ICOM implementation,
creates a digital intelligence system potentially far exceeding human level intelli-
gence given the right hardware to support the highly computationally intense
system needed to run ICOM.
26.7
Not like Our Own
One of the questions normally brought up has to do with motivations of a non-
human intelligent system such as ICOM. There are numerous scientists that have
done centuries of research on the human mind, artiﬁcial intelligence and the like.
One such example we can read is the paper “The Superintelligent Will: Motivation
and Instrumental Rationality in Advanced Artiﬁcial Agents” by Bostrom [14]. In
this paper Nick discusses how we might predict certain behaviors and motivations
of a full blown Artiﬁcial General Intelligence (AGI), even what is called an Artilect
or ‘Superintelligent Agent’. But the real question is, how do we actually implement
such an agent’s motivational system? The Independent Core Observer Model
(ICOM) cognitive architecture is a method of designing the motivational system of
such an AGI. Where Bostrom tells us how the effect of such a system works, ICOM
tells us how to build it and make it do that.
In the ICOM research program, we might not know how a true AGI might
decide motivations but we do have an idea on how ICOM will form those moti-
vations. It comes down to initial biasing and conditioning in terms of the right
beginning input that the system will judge all things on afterwards. It is not that we
are anthropomorphizing the motivations of the system [14] but it is the fact that we
can actually see those motivations deﬁned in the system and have it change them
over time enough to see in a broad way that it works very much like the human
mind at a very high level.
The differences between the traditional methods of trying to design AI from the
bottom up vs. the ICOM approach of top down have produced vastly different
results in many cases. There may be many ways to produce an ‘intelligence’ that
acts independently; ICOM, while not working anything like the human brain in
detail, very much models the logical effects of the mind; with the same sort of
emergent qualities that produce the mind as we experience it as humans. These
motivations or any of the elements exhibited by ICOM based systems are logical
implementations built out of a need to see the effect of, and not be tied to, the
biological substrate of the human mind and thus do not really work the same at the
smallest level.

Conclusion
The Independent Core Observer Model (ICOM) creates the effect of artiﬁcial
general intelligence or AGI as a strong emergent quality of the system. We dis-
cussed the basis data architecture of the data coming into an ICOM system and core
memory as it relates to the emergent elements. We can see how the memory is time
and patterns based. Also, we considered key elements of system theory as it relates
to that same observed behavior of the system as a substrate independent cognitive
extension architecture for AGI. In part, this chapter was focused on the ‘thought’
architecture key to the emergent process in ICOM.
The ICOM architecture provides a substrate independent model for true sapient
and sentient machine intelligence, at least as capable as human level intelligence, as
the basis for going far beyond our current biological intelligence. Through greater
than human level machine intelligence we truly have the ability to transcend
biology and spread civilization to the stars.

The Transhumanist Age
A door opened quietly and she walked into the room
her body smooth, supple
Her shoulders held back, proud
a glimmer in her eye
and without notice she brushes her hair away
“How old are you?” they asked,
“How old are you?”
A hesitation ﬁlled her
as she quickly assessed
“My augmentation is three years now
my right hip ﬁve
ocular implants just two weeks
age reversal nearly nine.”
She took a sip of water licking the droplets off her lips
her eyes glimmering-hair a shimmering sterling
her outer sheath like mulatto warm bronze
“How old are you?” they asked,
“How old are you?”
And when she turned to leave the room
all eyes followed her form
just to realize before she left
she was not yet born

Transhumanism: The Growing Worldview

Introduction
Transhumanism established a set of values conveying emerging technology and
humanity in three essential areas: critical thinking, visionary narratives, and tech-
nological innovation. The philosophy established values, goals, and principles that
synthesize epistemological and metaphysical views. Its roots stem from historical
systems of thinking that form social and cultural attitudes. For example, the
diversity of global culture, human rights, the economics of techno production and
supply, the ecology of well-being, the development of human enhancement inter-
ventions, radical life extension, and the politics of laws and policy-making. This
synergistic approach brought greater insight into assessing the challenges and
conﬂicts we face and how to build practical and applied solutions. The expression
of transhumanist thinking is practical optimism.
At the onset of transhumanist thinking, Information technology capital and faster
efﬁciency gains, especially in the production of computers and computer software,
advanced at a remarkable speed. Investors hedged their bets on emerging tech-
nologies—nanotechnology and biotechnology, robotics, and AI. Mobile phones,
satellite mapping, and globalization emerged through the World Wide Web.
Information now had its own DNA and people were called digital. Executives
were “mind workers”, businesses were automated, and employees were outsourced.
This was the Information Age.
Computing is not about computers any more. It is about living.—Nicholas Negroponte

Science in the 1990s was the ﬁxed mindset and technology was its the tool. Fast,
efﬁcient and formidable, the it propagated networks for querying how biotech and
infotech were going to change humanity.
It was evident, science navigated changes to biology and computer technology
emerged as the force through which information ﬂowed. Together they petitioned
for answers to unresolved questions about disease, aging and the ﬁnality of death.
Theories and speculation were turned in to practice when biotechnology iden-
tiﬁed the genes of Alzheimer’s disease and breast cancer. The ﬁeld of artiﬁcial
intelligence awoke from a long winter when it demonstrated evidence of machine
learning, and nanotechnology moved matter when it manipulated the xenon atoms
to spell out the IBM logo on the nanoscale.
Outside this highpoint and the waves of optimism, society was unaware of where
technology was headed. New technology meant new terms, advances in science
meant a need for translation. There was little explanation for what was meant by the
terms such as nanotech (Drexler) or AGI (Goertzel) that were being hurled at the
mainstream. People wanted to know where emerging technologies were headed,
intentionally or accidentally, how humanity could be affected, or changed, and who
would beneﬁt from the advances. There was a deep-seeded concern, especially
when information about the technologies were not readily available.
A new way of thinking was inevitable. This inevitability was met with the
philosophy of transhumanism [1].
Transhumanism established a set of values conveying the future technology and
humanity in three essential areas: critical thinking, visionary narratives, and tech-
nological innovation. The philosophy established values, goals, and principles that
synthesize epistemological and metaphysical views. Its roots stem from historical
systems of thinking that form social and cultural attitudes [2]. For example, the
diversity of global culture, human rights, the economics of techno production and
supply, the ecology of well-being, the development of human enhancement inter-
ventions, and the politics of laws and policy-making. This synergistic approach
brought greater insight into assessing the challenges and conﬂicts we face and how
to build practical and applied solutions. The expression of transhumanist thinking is
practical optimism. Its core embodies the nature of being curious, asking questions,
applying imagination, in facing many challenges of a hypermodern world that far
exceeds the postmodernist agenda, and to build a new understanding for human
rights. Through this, transhumanism is now regarded as a growing ﬁeld of study
and a discipline with numerous and proliferating sub-disciplines.
There are current successful projects that parallel the transhumanist agenda. For
example, the TED talks, Quantiﬁed Self, and global makerspace venues strongly
exemplify transhumanist thinking. All are marvelous venues for expressing human
experience across varied channels of communication and collaboration in making
meaningful contributions to society.
As examples, the TED talks present a narrative as an adventure through a type of
hero or heroine’s journey and how that journey contributed to personal growth, in a
way we can all share in the experience and learn from it. The Quantiﬁed Self (QS)
project encourages self-knowledge through data acquisition to track one or more
476
N. Vita-More

physical, cognitive, or behavioral elements in daily life. Makerspaces are collab-
orative venues for people to come together and identify unresolved issues, unravel
them, roll up their sleeves, and then create innovative solutions through a hands-on
do-it-yourself processes. All three of these examples evidence a culture of
self-responsibility and through this—helping other be better too. This sentiment, or
this intelligence, is sincere, in the moment and affects others—like an infectious
smile.
Self-responsibility, as a personal and social behavior, is spreading throughout
activities launched as entrepreneurial innovations. This is transhumanist in scope.
We start out with a distinct place in life and nurture our surrounding to build
practices from which to learn, evolve, and become more conscious of life, and its
preciousness. This could be interpreted as spiritual, or simply intelligent. Some
might call it a normal, innate aspect of human psychology about survival and
society. At the time, at the early stages of transhumanism and into the 21st Century,
this was needed. There was a socio-technological gap that the postmodernist era
could not resolve. Transhumanism bridged that gap. This is largely why transhu-
manism became a growing worldview.
27.2
Transhumanism
The Transhumanist Declaration establishes principles of transhumanism, and the
Transhumanist FAQ encapsulate much of the history. To add to the quality of these
documents, insights into the topic of transhumanism needs a personal voice, one
that experienced the beginning of the movement and continues to observe its
evolution. In this chapter, lend my voice to reﬂect on the past and sum up the future.
Through this, I defer to others’ works as well as unveiling the core topics by salient
writers on technological advancements.
These advancements include artiﬁcial intelligence, nanotechnology, uploading,
encryption, privacy, and the biotechnology of life extension that percolated through
the pages of a high-gloss print journal called Extropy: The Journal of
Transhumanist Thought (1988) [3]. To add to the quickening ﬂow of information
and at the onset of the world wide web, a few programmers built the original
transhumanist email list called extropy [4]. This list became the fertile hotbed for
high-level discussions among thought leaders whose brilliant minds cogitated over
what was yet to come with the arrival of emerging and exponential technology.
These ruminations became the themes of transhumanist conferences, starting in
1994, that formed an intellectual center for learning about accelerating technologies
that impact biology and life extension, intelligence gathering and supercomputing,
data collecting, and privacy [5]. Yet, it was not until the Internet exploded the
transhumanism spread and the development of other transhumanist organizations
27

still increases today with the use of social media and the mainstream’s awareness of
and interest in nanotechnology, AI/AGI, and life extension sciences.
The symbol for transhumanism gained branding currency as H+ over the years;
however, a distinct logo of h+ within an open circle is trademarked by Humanity+
for the logo of its non-proﬁt corporation and its magazine. Humanity+ [6] is cur-
rently the largest transhumanist organization and has ﬁlled the space of what
Extropy Institute left when it closed down. The irony is that today most of the
proto-transhumanists are board members or advisors, which has successfully
brought together the varied political views.
27.3
Misinformation
Half-truths with journalistic spin often bring about erroneous assertions bias. There
is no legal crime in propaganda for effect, especially in televised documentaries,
magazine articles, and blogs, or in creative approaches to debates and media
coverage. This tactic is all too known within the sphere of social change and the
future, especially when the change is perceived as fundamental to what it means to
be human. However, there is often a civil crime as an infringement on a person’s or
a group’s rights to have political and social freedom and equality. By this, I mean
the right to practice a way of life without being doggedly attacked by media that is
spreading misinformation, whether it be hyperbole by the press or academic
rhetoric.
In 2009, I came upon an academic journal The Global Spiral, which published
an article on transhumanism. The article was compromised of well-known scholars
but it was hampered by a lack of peer-review research of acceptable quality and/or
by a distinct degree of bias not satisfactorily accounted for by an analytical line of
inquiry, regardless of the overall literary scholarship and scope of knowledge. How
did these highly revered academics in the ﬁelds of social sciences, literature and
humanities misconstrue what I had experienced ﬁrst-hand within the realms of
transhumanist? In my stupor and annoyance, I contacted the Journal’s Managing
Editor who allayed my angst by inviting me to be a Guest Editor. The idea was for
me to bring in high-level transhumanist academics to challenge the misinformation
and write responsive counter arguments. Apparently this second Special Issue on
Transhumanism received a lot of attention and one year later, a compilation of the
essays from both sides of the arguments—the original essays and our responses—
were published as the book Transhumanism and Its Critics (2011) [7].
In The Global Spiral’s 2008 “Special Issue on Transhumanism” [8] (June, Vol. 6, Issue 3),
Guest Editor Hava Tirosh-Samuelson and ﬁve other authors, Ted Peters, Katherine Hayles,
Don Ihde, Jean-Pierre Dupuy, and Andrew Pickering, provocatively relay their concerns
about transhumanism to expectant ears. This responsive second Special Issue on
Transhumanism (2009, Feb., Vol. 9, Issue 3) is an opportunity for ten transhumanist
authors to evaluate the criticisms and address concerns [including Aubrey de Grey, Martine
Rothblatt, Max More, Nick Bostrom, and Russell Blackford]. This reﬂection is beneﬁcial in
478
N. Vita-More

helping us more precisely clarify interpretations of transhumanism and identify where our
own words may have been mistaken.
There are many predecessors to the idea that human evolution has not reached its
ﬁnal stage, tracing back at least to Nokolai Fedorov’s “common task” (1828–1903)
[9] and Jean Finot’s Philosophy of Long Life (1909) [10]. The philosophy and
social/cultural movement of transhumanism has developed not only from the words
“trans” and “human”, but also through an understanding that the human condition is
one in which we might go outside to gain perspective, a process of becoming, an
evolutionary transformation. As a bit of history, and to show the lineage of the
concept of the transhuman and transhumanism and how it evolved, below is a
synopsis of the term and its development.
• “Trans-human” and the Italian verb “transumanare” or “transumanar” was used
for the ﬁrst time by Dante Alighieri in Divina Commedia (1308–1321) [11]. It
means “go outside the human condition and perception” and in English could be
“to transhumanate” or “to transhumanize”.
• T.S. Eliot wrote about the risks of the human journey in becoming illuminated
as a “process by which the human is Transhumanised” in “The Cocktail Party”,
Complete Poems and Plays (1909–1950) [12, 13].
• Julian Huxley wrote about how humans must establish a better environment for
themselves, while still remaining man in New Bottles for New Wine, which
contains the essay “Transhumanism” (1957) [14]
• Teilhard de Chardin wrote about intellectual and social evolution and
ultra-humanity in The Future of Man. (1959) [15] Abraham Maslow referred to
transhumans in Toward a Psychology of Being (1962) [16].
• The Reader’s Digest Great Encyclopedia Dictionary deﬁned “transhuman” as
meaning “surpassing; transcending; beyond” (1966) [17].
• F.M. Esfandiary wrote about transhuman as an evolutionary transition in
“Transhumans 2000” (1972) [18, 19].
• Damien Broderick referenced transhumans in The Judas Mandala (1982) [20].
• Natasha Vita-More (f/k/a Nancie Clark) authored the “Transhuman Manifesto”
and the “Transhumanist Statement” (1983) [21].
• Robert Ettinger also referred to the transhuman in the preface (1989) in the
earlier published Man into Superman [22].
• The Webster’s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary (1983) [23] deﬁned
“transhuman” as meaning “superhuman,” and “transhumanize,” as meaning “to
elevate or transform to something beyond what is human”.
• Max More authored “Transhumanism: Toward a Futurist Philosophy” (1990),
which established the philosophy and worldview of transhumanism.
It may be impossible to validate absolute accuracy, but as active participants in
carving our future, it is a responsibility to relay information as carefully as possible
because it does ﬁlter through the minds of others.
It is necessary to distinguish between the terms transhuman, cyborg, and
posthuman [24]. The transhuman is an evolutionary transition from predetermined
27
Transhumanism: The Growing Worldview
479

genetics and limited lifespan to a therapeutic and selective enhancement for slowing
down and/or reversing aging, reﬁning cognition, and extending lifespan. This is
known as human enhancement. The cyborg is an augmentation to human biology to
adapt to diverse environments, such as space, which augmentation is a speciﬁc end
goal. The posthuman is a possible human future where a person could exist in the
biosphere, cybersphere and other artiﬁcial environments and substrates. The
posthuman is often referred to as an “upload”, a person who uploads into com-
putational sphere, or as a crossload where the person would co-exist in varied
environments, including the biosphere.
27.4
Social Needs and the Political in Brief
Transhuman advocacy in the mid-1980s to 1990s was not local, it was global—
from the US to Western Europe, including Sweden, The Netherlands, Belgium, the
UK. The larger hubs were located in Los Angeles and Silicon Valley. In Southern
California, a freethinking environment predominated the transhumanist ﬂora with
life extensionists, environmentalists, human rights activists, artists and writers,
cyberpunks, feminists, Liberals, Upwingers, Greens, and a health-oriented com-
munity of sports clubs. In Northern California, the turf was largely libertarian, with
computer scientists, programmers, technologists, cryptography and network secu-
rity specialists. Coincidentally, there was no conﬂict between the varied political
views since all were transhumanist thinkers and the larger issue was slowing down
aging, human enhancement, and radical life extension.
Setting a political stage, a small cable TV show called “Breakthroughs: A
TransCentury Update” (a/k/a “Transhuman Update”) aired in Los Angeles (1987–
1994) [25]. The show explored topics on social awareness where guests spoke
about future scientiﬁc and technological innovation. One beneﬁt that came out of
this show was that it provided a cross-disciplinary education of what the future
might bring. A secondary beneﬁt was that the show established a platform for
transhumanist discussions. Because of this, a viewer nominated me to run for
County Council for the 28th Senate District of Los Angeles County [26]. In 1992, I
was elected on a transhumanist platform with an emphasis on technological
mediation to environmental problems. I resigned after one year. The Internet was
just starting to evolve into a powerful platform for socio-political-economic dis-
cussions and advocacy, and seemed to be a far better format. It was new, exciting,
and evolving. It supported autonomy and human rights, freedom to express, and a
global community where Moore’s Law was accepted, racial life extension was
queried, and the technological singularity was understood as a possibility, but not a
fate accompli. Currently, there are over 836,000 websites on transhumanism, and it
is growing every moment.
With growth comes change. New voices were establishing email lists, websites,
forums, and debating social structures and governing bodies. It was not until around
1998 that a political discontinuity arose within transhumanism. No one knew
480
N. Vita-More

precisely why this occurred; it waves a red ﬂag of what not to do. In the political
realm, differences are unavoidable. Core transhumanist values can be adopted by
people with different backgrounds who may ﬁne-tune their political position to
harmonize with their transhumanist preferences. If this is accepted, then the
political differences and organizational perturbations should not be a public or
private embarrassment. In fact, this can be useful in identifying problems that have
not yet surfaced, or even invigorate a long-awaited pivot to gain momentum.
Movements experience these shifts when changes occur and people feel excluded or
their personal preferences have not given enough weight. And so it was with
transhumanism in the late 1990s—a time when liberals and libertarians both had a
strong voice and newly arriving socialists wanted their voice to be heard.
The fact is that there were many libertarians in the Silicon Valley; however, there
were also many Democrats, Greens, Republicans, Upwingers, and Independents
within transhumanism.
Quoting F.M. Esfandiary in his book Upwingers a Futurist Manifesto (1997),
the normative platform reaches beyond the Right/Left predicament and sets out a
non-linear evolving view of moving upward:
We are at all times slowed down by the narrowness of Right-wing and Left-wing alter-
natives. If you are not conservative, you are liberal if not right of center you are left of it or
middle of the road.
Our traditions comprise no other alternatives. There is no ideological or conceptual
dimension beyond conservative and liberal beyond Right and Left. … The premises of the
entire Left are indistinguishable from those of the entire Right. The extreme Left is simply a
linear extension of the extreme Right. The liberal is simply a more advanced conservative.
The radical Left is a more advanced liberal. … The Right/Left establishment is ﬁghting a
losing battle. It is following in the foot-steps of earlier traditionalists who resisted the more
modest breakthroughs of the past. … (pp. 21–25). (Esfandiary [27]).
Regardless of political divides, the focus must be on the goal is to stay alive as
long as possible, while effectively working toward developing for solutions to slow
down aging and the ﬁnality of death. Accountability has always been in the tran-
shumanist pipeline. It has become more critical in dealing with a conﬂuence of
ethical issues while pushing out strategies for success.
Transhumanism needs up-to-date policies and legislation. Protocols such as the
Proactionary Principle, an ethical decision making rule, is becoming crucial in
protecting people’s freedom to use technologies that are valuable, even critical, to
humanity [28]. The area of civil and human rights needs to be aligned with the current
political landscape, locally and globally. For example, the concept of morphological
freedom ought to be a human right—the right for a person to enhance his biological
(somatic and cognitive) system and, equally, a person should not be coerced to
enhance. This right protects those who want to enhance, or live longer and those who
want to remain biological or be more conservative in their enhancement.
Many people have also been involved in politics over the years. Since the 1992
County Council election for the 28th Senate District of LA County that formed a
transhumanist platform for emerging technologies, many formative people have
taken up expansive causes. James Hughes of Institute for Ethics and Emerging
27
Transhumanism: The Growing Worldview
481

Technologies (IEET) advocates the Technoprogressive stance (2015), David Wood
and the London Futurists advocate the UK Transhumanist Party (2015), a registered
political party in the United Kingdom, Marc Roux of the Association Française
Transhumaniste advocates the Technoprog! transhumanist politics in France
(2013). In Italy there have two distinct groups, the Italian Transhumanist
Association (AIT), and the Italian Transhumanist Network (NTI). In 2012, New
Scientist wrote an article claiming that Giuseppe Vatinno was the ﬁrst transhu-
manist elected, and later H+ Magazine wrote a different article stating that Gabriel
Rothblatt was the ﬁrst in 2015. In reality, neither were the ﬁrst. They are all
constituents within the larger global society that embraces transhumanist politics as
a necessary policymaking process, regardless of party names. Journalist Zoltan
Istvan created a proﬁle for what he calls a transhumanist party. Over time, there
may continue to be other groups and individuals who are not so clear in their
message, or in their use of transhumanism.
And even though the political arena is decades old and seasoned with the pre-
viously mentioned players it will continue to grow into a serious political agenda.
Relatedly, the Transhuman National Committee (2015), formed by David Kelley, is
a political action committee or PAC focused on Transhumanism in politics in the
United States. Its mission is long term with an intent to create political action on
policies and laws, as relevant to the government ofﬁcials and policymakers in
power. This mirrors the 2004 Vital Progress Summit, built on the premise of a
much needed progress action committee.
There have been numerous social agendas within transhumanism balancing the
right and left, there is yet to be an adaptation of an informed, transparent and
modern system that addresses morphological freedom or the Proactionary Principle.
nonetheless on the whole, transhumanism is concerned with human rights and
diversity, with a focus on critical thinking, visionary narratives, and technological
innovation. How this will be achieved is unknown, as it is an iterative process in the
making. It will blossom and wilt as it changes course, matures, and develops the
ﬂexibility to be truly transhumanist in scope.
Considering that cultural and social movements do exist in and respond to the
political climate of the day, there have probably been many advocates of life
extension and of technological innovation to help shape the future in a positive
direction. This brings to point other issues within this political arena, who has the
right to use the term transhumanism and for what cause. Since the term is in the
public domain anyone can use it. It this ethical? As a point of clariﬁcation, the word
transhumanism is in the public domain. Anyone can use the term and also the
abbreviation H+. If the term is part of a name that is trademarked or the H+ is a
trademarked logo, then it is not legal.

Emerging Technologies
In the Introduction of this Chapter, I suggested that the idea of transhumanism
surfaced during a time when the novelty of emerging technology attracted a certain
identiﬁable sensibility. But this sensibility is not a clear complexion. The many
faces of transhumanism represented the larger futurist community of science ﬁction,
literary visionaries, scholars of philosophy, researchers of scientiﬁc breakthroughs,
Silicon Valley tech entrepreneurs, innovators and the venture capitalists alike. Its
tone is varied and vast, and even cosmic. This domain of emerging technological
output, the products, processes, and Internet of things, including the devices we use
to expand cognition, the mobility devices we use to expand transportation, and the
digital networks we use to expand communications, is vast and exponential. This
might or might not be seen as a singularity or omega point. Ray Kurzweil turns it
mainstream in The Singularity is Near (2005), Peter Diamandis covers this spin in
Abundance (2012), and K. Eric Drexler sought it in Engines of Creation (1986).
Nick Bostrom addresses concern in Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies
(2014), and Anders Sandberg offers a sober tone in the trajectory “Whole Brain
Emulation—A Roadmap” (2008). David Pearce offers a different view in his
approach to utilitarian views, including the topic of happiness as fundamental in
“The Hedonistic Imperative” (1995). Martine Rothblatt explores sexual identity
beyond the two-gender system in Apartheid of Sex (1995).
Max More established the core values of transhumanism, and emphasizes con-
tinuity of personal identity over time, the human right of morphological freedom,
and the Proactionary Principle in policy making. Bostrom and Pearce formed a
utilitarian perspective of transhumanism, and while Pearce focuses on happiness as
essential, Bostrom addresses technology risks and AI related concerns. Kurzweil
and Rothblatt addressed complex patterns of the mind, and more currently Kurzweil
carves the synthesis of invention and innovation, while Rothblatt builds the course
for sexual continuity and freedom of gender. These foci differ in their approach to
transhumanism but together they are synergistic. They bring perspective to the
society of transhumanism in the journey toward the necessary conditions enabling
human enhancement and radical life expansion.

Prometheus: Yes, I’ve made it so that humans cannot foresee their own death.
Chorus: What sort of medicine did you use for this?
Prometheus: I’ve ﬁlled their hearts with blind hopes.
Chorus: That is a great gift you’ve given to the humans.
Prometheus: And more than that, I’ve given them the gift of ﬁre.
Chorus: So the ephemeral creatures now possess the bright-faced ﬁre?
Prometheus: Yes, and with it they will learn many crafts [29].
The patterns of practice that expose the pros and the cons of technology that effect
transhumanism are not just the dream of a better life that transhumanism embraces; it

is accountability—the conviction to investigate, understand, and problem solve pos-
sible dangers. These ideas are summed up in The Transhumanist Reader:
Contemporary and Classical Essays on the Science, Technology, and Philosophy of
the Human Future (More and Vita-More 2012), where forty-two thought leaders of
emerging and speculative science and technology discuss their potential and concern.
27.6
Practical Transhumanism
Through growing pains and maturation, weathering the storm of doomsayers and
alarmists, bioethical moralists, and achieving acceptance in the academic world and
the mainstream alike, we are here today. This interconnected community aligns
nicely with transparency, open source, the social scientist, and maker-sensibility of
a shared by those who want to improve their human condition.
Practical transhumanism reinforces this aim, as people cannot be ready for the
future if they do not prepare for its challenges. The aspect of what we call the
human condition that transhumanism is motivated toward is sustaining health and
well-being as long as feasibly possible. There are many practices that approach this
aim, especially nutrition and exercise, and beyond this an intervention of the
deleterious aspects of disease—the deterioration of the body, and brain caused by
diseases of aging. The intention to be healthy as long as possible and to understand
the genetic script as an intervention to alter a ﬁxed biology. This is not translated as
for only the wealthy or privileged; it is for everyone—a democratized life extension
of social equality. Life extension as a basic human right. Life extension as a Holy
Grail in changing the world through uniqueness and value of transhumanist
thinking.
Transhumanist thinking is a method to solve complex problems and to develop
desired conditions for existence. Transhumanist thinking applies critical thinking in
creating visionary trajectories for well-being and super longevity (a/k/a radical life
extension). This may be the single most valuable asset of transhumanism today.
Over many decades, transhumanists have questioned, and debated, and developed
the major topics concerning life extension and technology as an iterative process.
This process includes varied scenarios for human futures—speciﬁcally, emerging
sciences and technologies that are altering the world and the beneﬁts and the
concerns of apparent risks. The framework for this process includes deﬁning the
opportunity that transhumanism offers to society, gathering information, question-
ing assumptions about humanity, incubating ideas, evaluating the pros and cons of
technology. How this framework is realized in the real world is through projects.
Some of these projects are workshops and conferences, others are written or
recorded experiences. Some of these projects are innovative, such as developing
technologies and performing scientiﬁc research. The areas in which these process
are relative to transhumanist thinking include biological health and well-being, and
technologies such as artiﬁcial general intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology,
nanomedicine, cryonics, relative to human enhancement and cognitive science and
484
N. Vita-More

neuroscience relating to brain functions, including transferring and copying the
functions onto computational systems.
The challenge is to make meaning—substantial, forthcoming, and realistic. To
start off by doing things that are meaningful. For transhumanists, meaningful is
happy, healthy, long life; one that continues beyond the maximum human lifespan.
The discussion is to not underestimate or overestimate the pace of technology
and its effect on well-being, human behavior, and modifying physiology. Clearly,
biotechnology and nanotechnology have the potential to eradicate cell degeneration
and unﬁx humans from biology. Artiﬁcial general intelligence, virtuality, and
bio-artiﬁcial fusion have the potential to amplify cognition, increase awareness, and
transfer cognition from biological cells onto non-biological systems. Continuity,
transparency and immersivity of computer-based interactions catalyze one person
and one identity into multiple, varied aspects of personhood. The signiﬁcance and
the outcome of these effects on human physiology could result in the design of new
types of humans, new platforms for human existence, and the extension of human
life over time.
There is an observable challenge for each person throughout diverse cultures, the
worldwide economics of production and supply and the development of policies
and practices. This is a strong reason for transhumanism’s approach of critical
thinking and a proactive stance in navigating greater insight to the many challenges
and how to build solutions.
People are living longer as biotechnology develops new methods for conquering
disease and marveled therapies for injury. Personalized genome services offer DNA
sequencing of DNA. Smart devices provide memory storage up to 128 GB, a
business can a system with 120 petabytes. This is the Transhumanist Age.

Transhumanism arrived during what is often referred to as the postmodernist era, although
it has only a modest overlap with postmodernism. Ironically, transhumanism shares some
postmodernist values, such as a need for change, reevaluating knowledge, recognition of
multiple identities, and opposition to sharp classiﬁcations of what humans and humanity
ought to be. Nevertheless, transhumanism does not throw out the entirety of the past because
of a few mistaken ideas. Humanism and scientiﬁc knowledge have proven their quality and
value. In this way, transhumanism seeks a transmodernity or hypermodernism rather than
arguing explicitly against modernism. One aspect of transhumanism that we hope to explore
and elucidate throughout this book is the need for inclusivity, plurality, and continuous
questioning of our knowledge, as we are a species and a society that is forever changing. The
roots and core themes of transhumanism address some of the underlying themes that have
formed its philosophical outlook” (More and Vita-More, 2012).

Why I Am a Transhumanist
Dirk Bruere
28.1
Deﬁnition of Transhumanism
Let’s begin with (almost) the most basic deﬁnition of Transhumanism, from Max
More, circa 1990:
Transhumanism is a class of philosophies of life that seek the continuation and acceleration
of the evolution of intelligent life beyond its currently human form and human limitations
by means of science and technology, guided by life-promoting principles and values.
I say “almost” because like subsequent deﬁnitions and declarations it attempts to
tack on extra baggage in the form of ethical or political caveats. Of course I would
like it to be “guided by life-promoting principles and values” but it does not have to
be. Those addenda are at best conscious attempts to guide the use of Transhumanist
technologies, and at worst just wishful thinking.
This is not really the place for an exposition of the technologies which are
enablers of Transhumanist ambitions, which can be easily found online. However, I
will deal with some of them in due course as they affected my choice to call myself
a “Transhumanist”. So, let’s go back to my childhood where much of this had its
origins.
28.2
Childhood
I grew up in a village in England in the 1950s as the son of a South African
immigrant father and English mother. It was still reasonably “traditional” in that
squalid Medieval sense of outside toilets and where people kept pigs and chickens

in their back garden, everyone knew everyone else’s business, conformity was next
to divinity, and anyone whose family had not lived there for the past 200 years was
one of the “new people”. In the immediate post-war period dressing your
uber-Aryan looking son with the white/blond hair in lederhosen was probably not a
popular choice among the locals. So, off to a running start with triple points on
“outsider” status.
Our neighbors were also people who might charitably be described as “char-
acters”. The ugly old woman who in earlier times would probably have been
hanged as a witch and who enjoyed a touch of thieving from the next door shop in
her spare time. “Old Cossy” and her fat lazy husband who kept a pig in the garden
and did not want to be disturbed by the sound of children playing as he slept off his
Sunday lunch. Deaf Pete, who would later be killed crossing the road because he
did not hear the trafﬁc. Old Jack, blinded in the First World War by mustard gas.
Some people further up the road that “had something wrong with them”, whatever
that meant. The woman who had being dying of cancer, for years (the word
“cancer” being said in a whispered voice as if saying the name out loud might act as
an invitation). And Old Juddy. Yes, everybody over 30 was “Old” in those days,
and looked it.
It was he who ﬁrst introduced us, me and my younger brother and sister, to the
notion of pointless cruelty to animals. One day the three of us were in the garden
and to entertain us he grabbed one of his hens by the legs and plucked it to death in
front of us. Being rather young at the time (all of us under 6 years old) we were not
quite sure what to make of it. I know that I did not like it and neither did my father
when I told him. But these were the times and these were the people around us.
Can you imagine the mentality of someone who believes that casual animal
torture is a suitable way to entertain children? It was not even dressed up as “sport”.
Like I said—Medieval.
Then it was off to primary school, where I learned other interesting lessons
concerning pecking orders, violence, bullying and stupidity. And that was just from
the teachers. Another scene, from when I was nine years old and had misheard
which exercise to do from the textbook. The teacher comes up to me and asks in an
annoyed voice why I was doing the wrong work. I started to reply: “I thought…”
whereupon he hit me round the head and shouted: “You are not here to think!” The
irony of that escaped me for quite a number of years, but I got there in the end.
As for the other kids, well in the space of a couple of years I had been in
numerous ﬁghts, none of which I started, and had been off school twice due to the
extent of my injuries. Of course, nothing was done about the situation by either
parents or teachers—it was “normal”. As was seeing kids covered in blood from
such ﬁghts, including me when my nose was broken. That one was not serious
enough for time off school.
Much of that I put down to various pieces of advice my parents had given me.
Probably the thing that got me into the most trouble was a sense of justice and the
belief I should stand up when other people were being bullied—“protecting the
weak”. From my father. Not to mention injunctions to always tell the truth, which
he neglected to say never made one popular.

D. Bruere

A close second was not acquiescing to the pecking order games which were, and
probably still are, a part of the barbarism of childhood and which only become more
subtle as people become adults. Back then, the local “top dog” would pick on
someone at random and just painfully punch their shoulder. If they did not ﬁght
back it meant, in modern slang, that you were “their bitch”. If you did ﬁght back, it
got ugly.
Which is where my mother’s piece of counterproductive advice played its part:
“Violence never solves anything”. In effect it meant that even if I won the ﬁght I
would be “reasonable” and not push my advantage to total victory, having hoped
that the other kid had “learned his lesson”. Wrong—mercy equals weakness among
such people.
This cycle of violence only ended when I changed schools, and not because new
kids appeared but because the ﬁrst time it started up again I lost my temper and
threw the bully across a desk. I pushed the advantage, and from that point on it all
ceased. It was like a cartoon light bulb switching on in my head—insufﬁcient
violence never solves anything.
Meanwhile, my life outside of school was one of obsession with science. Here I
had facts, theories and opinions that were not accompanied by physical violence or
fear. There were no gangs to run away from in the library. By the time I was ten I
was reading graduate level inorganic chemistry textbooks and everything I could
ﬁnd on other sciences. The stupidity of those around me I found appalling. Too bad
about that honesty thing…
I sailed through school, getting top marks without putting in more than minimal
effort. And that was bad in itself, because it developed in me a laziness that has
taken most of a lifetime to shake off.
Through all of this was a factor that I would not discover for another thirty years
or so. It was that almost certainly I was suffering from what is now termed “high
functioning autism”. Its major symptoms, apart from the physical, were lack of
social awareness, obsessive interests (scitech), literal mindedness and a massive
insecurity when it came to dealing with people. People were stupid, cruel, vicious,
over emotional, weak, pathetic and horribly unpredictable. I viewed ordinary people
as ordinary people view the mentally ill.
Most of all though, was that I had a strong sense of “How Things Should Be”
and this wasn’t it. I recall one night lying in a ﬁeld looking at the stars in the clear
night sky and just wanting to get off this planet. Ironically, I recently discovered a
site for those with Asperger’s is actually named “Wrong Planet”.
While I was reading my books in front of the TV my parents were watching
popular soaps, which reinforced my opinions. They are all about stupid people doing
stupid things for all the wrong reasons and then suffering pointless consequences that
anyone with half a brain could avoid with ease. I found them endlessly frustrating
and although I sometimes watch one or two occasionally to check, they are the same
now as then. It’s like those reality/documentary TV police shows where the level of
imbecility is illustrated when some idiot tries to shoot his way out of getting a
parking ticket. Turning a minor ﬁne into a death penalty. Good riddance—the
average IQ of the world rises slightly.
28
Why I Am a Transhumanist
491

I recall my grandmother telling me a story about when she was young, at the
outbreak of WW1, when groups of men armed with sticks roamed the streets for
Dachshund dogs to beat to death, because “they were German”. Do you really want
to live in the same universe as that kind of weapon grade stupidity?
Which led to my having a very elitist and increasingly callous view of people in
general. Conversely, the thing that I could not tolerate was cruelty to animals or
children. At least in some measure adults deserved whatever horror was visited
upon them, and there was no shortage judging from the news reports.
28.3
The Human Condition
One of the things that both annoyed me and propelled me towards the idea of
upgrading Humanity wholesale was the once popular catch-all beloved of
avant-garde playwrights “The Human Condition”. This was the more intellectual-
ized soap opera where the usual suspects were examining their own suffering in
terms of “what it means to be Human”. Again, the aspects of the condition tended to
be things like jealousy, anger, rage, greed, stupidity, depression, violence… the list
continues. In fact, what they generally describe are all the things that make us
sub-Human. Things that stem from our evolutionary ancestry. It has been said that
we are a halfway stage between apes and angels. I say it is time to edit out the ape
and enhance the angelic qualities, which are the things which truly distinguish us as
Human. They include rationality, love, compassion, empathy and intelligence.
None of which make for good drama or exciting shoot-outs.
Then, when I was sixteen and on New Year’s Day 1970 my father died early in
the morning from a heart attack. It was slow, painful and protracted. My ﬁrst direct
contact with death. So, how did I feel? Answer is, I don’t know. It was only in later
years I missed him. What I do know is that in the pre-Internet age people died when
they could have lived, for lacking a single piece of knowledge. In his case chewing
a couple of aspirin would probably have saved his life. This was known at the time,
but not by most doctors.
Less than a year later I was in bed one Christmas morning reading a book whose
title escapes me, but one quote hit me right between the eyes. It was by a man
named I J Good:
Let an ultra-intelligent machine be deﬁned as a machine that can far surpass all the intel-
lectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these
intellectual activities, an ultra-intelligent machine could design even better machines; there
would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of man
would be left far behind.
My reaction was an instant “YES!”
Finally, a way forward or a way out.

28.4
AI Winters
However, in the years that followed there was a lot of what turned out to be
misplaced optimism concerning the difﬁculties involved. The hype and following
failures resulted in several rounds of funding cuts known as the “AI Winters” which
lasted until the mid-1990s. In my opinion it was always naive to think Human level
intelligence could run on machines which obviously had millions of times less
processing power than the brain, and the bar was set unreasonably high by the 1968
movie “2001: A Space Odyssey” with HAL. It is only now, in 2015, that serious
inroads are being made on machines of suitable power, but there is a lot more to do
before true Artiﬁcial General Intelligence arrives.
This is also a technology not only whose time is arriving but the warnings also
written of by I.J. Good all those years ago are being echoed by the likes of Elon
Musk and Stephen Hawking. Namely, if we get it wrong it could prove an
extinction event. So ponder a question I asked on a large Transhumanist group,
which went something like this:
If you had a choice between us creating an AI that vastly exceeded Human capabilities in
all spheres of endeavor but would lead to Human extinction, or no AI ever and Humanity
just carrying on as it is, which would you choose?
Most voted for the AI, along with me. Of course, the excluded middle way was
the favored one of a Human-AI merger. How realistic that is remains to be seen.
28.5
Transhumanist Moment
My next “Transhumanist moment” was at a Mensa party in the mid-1970s where I
was discussing mind uploading (a very Transhumanist meme) with a man whose
name stuck with me partly because it was unusual, but also because he was wearing
a bow tie. He was Madsen Pirie, later to found the Adam Smith Institute. At the
time we called ourselves “Immortalists” because although the word “Transhuman”
was used by F.M. Esfandiary in 1972 we had never heard of him, or it. At that point
my Transhumanist interests rested for almost two decades.
In the intervening years my problems in dealing with people became apparent
even to me, and I started to do something about it. What prompted it was the
realization that while technology might be a unique and deﬁning factor in our
current civilization, it was still subservient to politics. In other words, people run
this planet, not scitech. I suppose it was at this point I ceased to be the archetypal
nerd. Re-wiring ones brain is not easy.
I started by forcing myself into situations that I found extremely stressful, but
which other people obviously found simple. To give you an example, even at the
age of twenty ﬁve I would break out into a sweat if I had to answer the telephone. It
28

was because of the unpredictability of what was to follow. When making a phone
call I would ﬁrst decide what I wanted to say, checked off all the possible responses
and then had my reply to them ready to go. An incoming call I could not plan. So I
put myself in positions where the interaction with people was both necessary and
almost random. I practiced being Human.
I analyzed small talk and discovered how to keep boring conversations, of the
type beloved by ordinary people, going. You just repeat various words back at them
such as, who how what when where why and always remember that the thing
people most like talking about is themselves! I modeled body language and espe-
cially the ways people looked at each other. Eventually after enough practice I
could pass as “normal”, apart from occasions when I was drunk or tired, whereupon
old habits would re-assert themselves and I uttered something “inappropriate” or
just started up with the body movements.
I took up martial arts, which I continue to practice to this day. Just talking to
people and teaching a class was a big step towards changing my mentality, as was
meditation. Then, in my thirties, I tried LSD.
To say it expanded my consciousness would be an immense understatement. If
meditation was a candle in the darkness LSD was like a nuclear explosion. The ﬁrst,
and subsequent trips, were the most profound experiences of my life. It’s the closest
I have ever come to having Posthuman sensory and introspective capability. To
those of you who have never tried it, or similar, you might think that this world and
reality are “normal” but they are not. The world is utterly bizarre. It’s amazing and
very little of it is what it seems. I went in a hardcore materialist atheist with a
contempt for just about everyone and came out… different.
The biggest difference from other people’s point of view was that I came to value
the innate goodness of many people as highly as I rate intelligence. No mean feat…
As the decades passed, while there was progress towards Transhumanist tech-
nologies, there remained only one which had actually been implemented. That is the
enhanced immune system, aka vaccination. Now, some people might be thinking…
“what about eye glasses?”. Unfortunately, although we have plenty of add-ons like
glasses, writing and iPhones these are external augmentations. The modern “mis-
sion statement” is “better than well” using internalized and permanent tech.
Meanwhile, some people including myself settled for the halfway house of DIY
biohacking, most commonly via the use of nootropic drugs to enhance memory or
intelligence (slightly) or prolong healthy lifespan. All are marginal at present. The
future I was looking for has not yet arrived. The older future… maybe… In case
you have not encountered the meme, it goes something like this:
Unless you are over sixty you were not promised ﬂying cars – you were promised a
cyberpunk dystopia. And you are getting it.

post-apocalyptic dystopia. The relevant word in all that being “dystopia”. That is
the default setting for the future we are heading into unless some considerable
494

political effort is put into changing course. Greed, high technology, stupidity—we
can survive any two out of three but unfortunately all the cherries have come up
Jackpot on the Homo Sapiens slot machine. Transhumanism is the attack on stu-
pidity, and indirectly, greed. In my opinion, and I am not alone in this, we either
make the jump to the Posthuman or we fail in a horribly spectacular manner—think
chimps with machine guns. The future with Homo Sapiens still in charge will look
just like the past few thousand years of history, but with increasingly destructive
weapons and more effective technologies of oppression.
This is not to dismiss the immensely positive effects that education has on
society, or the prosperity created through technological innovation. In the world
today people en masse are better off than at any time in history, by any objective
measure. Unfortunately, this can be undone within a single generation because it is
all external add-ons to Humans. We have not yet changed fundamental Human
Nature, nor extended innate capabilities in a permanent manner. It can be undone by
all the things we are failing to do, and which may result in everything from
dangerous climate change to resource depletion wars. The irony is that we have all
the technology we need to ﬁx the world coupled with the stupidity to not apply it.
And that’s how it has been, right up until now (2015).

CRISPR and the Designer Baby
In 2015 something changed that will have major ramiﬁcations in the coming years
—CRISPR. This is an unbelievably big breakthrough in precision genetic engi-
neering applicable to Humans almost immediately. In tabloid-speak, the whole
“designer baby” issue is back on the table as a practical possibility, not to mention
tailoring gene therapies to cure speciﬁc diseases.
Then came Elizabeth Parrish, CEO of BioViva, who has used CRISPR tech-
nology to genetically engineer herself with two forms of gene therapy, outside of
United States jurisdiction. In one treatment, she received injections into her muscles
containing the gene follistatin, which in animal experiments is shown to increase
muscle mass by blocking myostatin. In another she received an intravenous dose of
viruses containing genetic material to produce telomerase, a protein that extends
telomeres, a component of chromosomes known as the “aging clock.” With this she
intends to reverse at least some major aspects of the aging process.
The signiﬁcance of what she has done is fourfold. She has bypassed what would
normally be a decade long multi-billion dollar process by Big Pharma by going
straight to Human trials (herself). She has done it outside of the normal regulatory
processes by doing it in clinics in Mexico and Colombia. She is a living demon-
stration that anti-aging technology may well be practical here and now. And last,
that almost anyone can use this technology cheaply. DIY Human genetic engi-
neering has arrived.

28.7
Posthuman
Yet we still live in a ludicrously primitive world. People still die of old age, and we
don’t even have a general ﬁx for when cellular programming goes wrong (cancer).
Getting anything done is like wading through mud, it takes so long. On alternate
days of the week I tend to feel that this cannot be the real world. Still, for now it’s
the only game in town and we need to ﬁx the people and the place. That is
increasing a political task, not a technological one. Soon all the pieces will be in
place for a jump to the Posthuman, and we better start planning it now before we are
overwhelmed by events.
Returning to politics, I despise the fashionable pessimism of Western culture—
the “we are all doomed”, the “no can do” and all the bullshit reasons politicians trot
out to explain why idiocy and greed has to rule. I despise all the lazy Luddite mass
media cliches whenever Transhumanist topics are given a hearing—from
Frankenstein and Hitler to those “Designer Babies” (as if the having happier,
healthier more intelligent children was a bad thing) and the utterly predictable
“Playing God”. When it comes to the latter accusation, I am with Craig Venter, one
of the founders of the ﬁeld of synthetic biology—we are not playing.
28.8
Ethics
This latter accusation has a more intellectual wrapping under the catchall term
“Ethics”. It is wheeled out as a weapon in the war. Typically, there is a call for an
“ethical debate” usually accompanied by calls for a moratorium on the technology
and murmurings about the Precautionary Principle and how it must ﬁrst be proven
to be safe. This is, of course, the bad faith use of the concept since nothing can be
shown to be safe, not even salt or water, and the problem with any unknown side
effects is that they are unknown and will remain so if the Luddites gets their way.
However, even if we take the question of ethics seriously there seems to be no
discussion on whose ethics. Are we talking about Judeo-Christian? Secular Liberal
Humanism? Sharia Islam? Confucian Chinese? Hindu? Japanese Shinto? Buddhist?
Coupled with this is the assumption that whichever is chosen it should suddenly
become the global consensus. This is because of the inﬂuence of the West and in
particular the USA with its uneasy political combination of both the Religious Right
and Secular Humanism. Unfortunately the thing they have in common is the belief
that their way is not only the right way but the only way that must prevail. These
beliefs are part of the arrogance of a fading Western culture and power that seeks to
continue the imposition of its values on the rest of the world.
This was exempliﬁed recently when a groundbreaking paper from Chinese
researchers involving genetically modifying a Human embryo was denied publi-
cation in arguably the most prestigious journals in the West—Science (USA) and
Nature (UK) in large part because the publishers did not like the ethics of the
496
D. Bruere

experiment. So they censored it because of their knee-jerk dislike for non-Western
mores. So, am I arguing against ethics inﬂuencing technological choices?
No. I believe that we all need a code of ethics to live by. What I am saying is that I
do not believe we should be imposing our views on other peoples, nor letting them
impose theirs on us. A very liberal view…
The above naturally carries over into public opinion expressed by readers
comments in the mass media, usually selected by editors. These are all the people
who write in on articles such as turning the clock back on the aging process with
comments like “I don’t want to live forever” and how it’s “unnatural”. Because the
hidden subtext is that they don’t want you to “cheat death” either. I have often
wondered why such a cognitive dissonance exists in people who would have no
hesitation going to a doctor if they had a life threatening condition, yet express the
desire that they want to die of old age. Except technically nobody dies of old age—
they die of the diseases caused by old age. Cancer, heart disease, stroke, dementia…
28.9
Politics
My only conclusion is that perhaps it is a shield against false hope, or maybe Freud
was correct and there really is something akin to a death wish in people. Or maybe
it is a speciﬁc example of a more general case whereby you can always rely on a
segment of the oppressed to praise their oppression as being somehow necessary
and for their own good. This is in large part where the political battle for hearts and
minds must be fought and won by us.
That is why my efforts right now are going towards promoting the various
Transhumanist Parties that appeared around the globe in 2015. Do we expect to
form governments? No. Our role model is the Green Party in terms of brand
recognition, message and inﬂuence. In many cases, you can think of us as Hitech
Greens—the Bright Greens. What the Greens might have been if they had embraced
the future rather than a false romanticized past.
So what’s coming and what can you do?
Well, what’s coming is the end of Humanity this century, one way or another.
There is no “business as usual” option. I would prefer it to be a smooth and peaceful
transition to a glorious world of freedom and transcendence rather than a terminal
apocalyptic nightmare. Which do I think it will be? Well, let me toss this coin…
So, what can you do? Choose one, and make it happen. Choose life over death
and love over fear. Or not. There is no bigger issue facing Humanity.
Whatever happens, we are going to get what we deserve.

The Splintering and Controversy
of Transhumanism
Emily Peed
29.1
The Transhumanist Movement
The rudimentary pieces of transhumanism began their basic conceptualization in a
1923 essay by British geneticist J.B.S. Haldane’s Daedalus: Science and the Future
[1]. He and other writers during the time began to speculate the development of
eugenics, space travel and colonization, bionic implants, unhinged cognitive
development, and applications of high technologies to the limitations of man. Over
the decades, these smattering of ideas began to coalesce and gain momentum.
However, it was not until Julian Huxley wrote an article in 1957, titled
Transhumanism, that the axioms gained a focus. The article elaborated on the
general archetype of transhumanism as a progressive movement while simultane-
ously cementing Huxley as the father of it.
What is most enthralling about this movement is that many aspects of its
implementation are waiting for advanced technologies to step out from between the
pages of science ﬁction books. The ultimate culminating event that will set the stage
for the era to follow is referred to as the Singularity, which was proposed by British
Cryptologist I.J. Good in 1965 [1]. Some have predicted that this moment will
occur in the next few decades, as soon as 2030 [2]. This is when artiﬁcial intelli-
gence and computing systems will reach the point of being recursive self-learning
machines. This landmark event in the creation of a computing superintelligence
may leave humanity grasping at an accelerating level of intellectual aptitude that
would quickly outpace anything familiar to us; singularity casts a thick fog of
uncertainty through this highly unpredictable period of human history.
Only time will unveil how the radical implications of advanced technology will
impact us into the future; until then, we must work diligently on facilitating a
massive, global conversation about what technology is, the potential of superin-

telligence, and how mankind could dramatically transform should just a few of the
concepts of transhumanism come to fruition within the next few decades. Until that
time, focus should be paid to bracing society, leveling the playing ﬁeld, and
equalizing access to these technologies that will catapult us to the highest reaches of
our potential. These efforts will be paramount in making transhumanism a viable
option for the entire world.
29.2
Digital Divide
One of the most present concerns of transhumanism is that the world will not
experience these types of technologies at the same time. Will developing nations
leapfrog to singularity or will the digital divide continue grow? The growing digital
divide could cause an even greater disparity between developing nations and
industrialized countries. Just as industrial revolutions took place under different
periods, circumstances, and timeframes for different parts of the world so too will
the events of Singularity and the assimilation of advanced technology.
We are beginning to come to an apex in the evolvement of transhumanism. How
well we adapt and prepare ourselves for these extreme shifts in technological
advancement depends on the conversations we have beforehand. These conversa-
tions can be facilitated through overseeing organizations, political representation,
educational efforts, and integration of philosophies through modern adaptations of
religions; these efforts only continue to reveal themselves in importance as tran-
shumanism takes deeper roots while splintering further as it integrates into the lives
of diverse people around the world.
29.3
Humanity+
The World Transhumanist Association, which later become Humanity+ or H+,
released two formal deﬁnitions of transhumanism after the early turn of the mil-
lennia, and they are:
1. The intellectual and cultural movement that afﬁrms the possibility and desir-
ability of fundamentally improving the human condition through applied reason,
especially by developing and making widely available technologies to eliminate
aging and greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological
capacities
2. The study of the ramiﬁcations, promises, and potential dangers of technologies
that will enable us to overcome fundamental human limitations, and related
study of the ethical matters involved in developing and using such technologies
500
E. Peed

These statements were released in with the Transhumanist Declaration in 2002
[3]. After decades of incubation, transhumanism has begun to solidify itself and has
taken form as a political party, as subsets of major religions, and has been ﬁnding
mixed levels of acceptance among varying groups within society, ranging from
total embrace to a contemptuous rejection. No matter the individual objective
opinion that each person is entitled to about transhumanism, it is undeniable the
support, momentum, and relevance that it will evolve to encompass and represent as
our technological future advances rapidly the next pending few decades.
We are beginning to contend with some of the basic underlying aspects of
transhumanism and question what role technology will play in the evolution of
humanity. While we also focus on the technological impact, we must realize that
humans have a very keen inﬂuence on the path that technology takes. For example,
relatively recently within 24 h of deployment a Twitter AI unit from Microsoft,
who tweeted and interacted with people like a bubbly teenaged girl, was removed
from online after became a hate spewing, racist bot after interacting with many
individuals—a troll’s thing of beauty [4].
This was not a technology that set out to become a racist; it was a learned habit
from humans. What this shows is that artiﬁcial intelligence and robotics may be
able to supersede our primitive notions of control, dominance, or thirst for power
simply by design, but learn hatred and bigotry from humans. We are the most
volatile aspect of technology, not the technology itself. If not watched closely, the
future may arrive too fast for others to keep pace with and one day might be ﬂoored
to ﬁnd that the racist, renegade twitter application of 2016 will be your automated
banking manager in 2036.
Participation has started to ﬂourish within transhumanism as our digital age
blossoms. These are people who can run the gambit of life extensionists, tech-
nologist, futurist, Singularitarians, biohackers, AI proponents, and advanced
robotics enthusiast to those who are simply looking for the next leap in human
evolution. Now, some of these terms might seem foreign to individuals who are not
participating or watching this movement, but the philosophy has been ﬁnding
applicability in far more familiar grounds.
29.4
Evolving Nature of Transhumanist Thought
Transhumanism is weaving its way into the more common elements of the fabric of
our society as religions and prevailing thought processes around the world are
beginning to come to the revelation that the technology of the future will do
miraculous things to expand human potential. We are ﬁnding an uptake in the
number of individuals who are adopting the technology as part of their religious,
personal, and political beliefs. To help facilitate political aspects of this, Zoltan
Istvan founded the Transhumanist Party in 2014, which is dedicated to putting
29
The Splintering and Controversy of Transhumanism
501

science, health, and technology at the forefront of United States politics, but also
acted as a platform for him to attempt to run as a 2016 presidential candidate as
well.
That is simply speaking politically. Adoption of the philosophy in a religious
sense has been occurring for over a decade on multiple fronts. In 2006, fourteen
founding members of the Mormon Transhumanist Association met, drafted, and
adopted a constitution [5]. During that same year, they also created a non-for-proﬁt
organization that is afﬁliated with h+ to further facilitate their goals. They elaborate
on their belief at their website, found at transﬁgurism.org, and it ﬁrst describes how
Transﬁgurism is a religious manifestation of Transhumanism, this is an overseeing
term that is inclusive to our Mormon, Buddhist, or even Christian subsets that have
embraced a transhumanist outlook. They deﬁne Mormonism as a religion of the
Judeo-Christian tradition that advocates immersive discipleship of Jesus Christ that
leads to creative and compassionate works [5]. As of September 2015, the Mormon
Transhumanist Association had 549 members who supported the Transhumanist
Declaration and the Mormon Transhumanist Afﬁrmation [5].
Just as the Mormon Transhumanist Association, there is also Christian
Transhumanism. This adoption of transhumanism was created after a small group of
individuals felt compelled to unite in April of 2014 to bring hope in a more modern
presentation that utilizes human technology to share the love of their redeeming
savior [6]. They have taken to describing themselves as an organization that is
“participating with God in the redemption reconciliation, and renewal of the world”
and abide by the commandments to love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and
strength… and love your neighbor as yourself [6]. According to the christiantran-
shumanism.org website, there are multiple prongs to their beliefs that fuse both
transhumanism and Christianity together [6]:
1. We believe that God’s mission involves the transformation and renewal of
creation
2. We seek growth and progress along every dimension of our humanity
3. We recognize science and technology as tangible expression of our God-given
impulse to explore and discover
4. We are guided by Jesus’ great commands
5. We believe that the intentional use of technology, coupled with following
Christ, will empower us to become more human
These beliefs may manifest themselves in ways that might not be expected. For
example, as in the applicability of such freedom of religion and choice goes beyond
that of just human intelligence, consciousness, and experience. A Florida Pastor by
the name of Christopher Benek, who is also key in the Christian Transhumanist
organization, sees that the redemption that individuals can seek through religion as
something that should not be limited to human beings alone [7]. He is providing a
unique perspective to robotic AI, suggesting that when it beings to achieve con-
sciousness and questions the meaning of its existence that it can also have an
opportunity to turn to Christianity for answers. This is an area which some might
502
E. Peed

ﬁnd blasphemous or an affront to God. For others, this is an extraordinary com-
bination of ideas. They believe that by pursuing Christian Transhumanism, or any
other subset, that they can support and hold true to their faiths, but utilize our new
technological age to its fullest extent.
Pastor Benek has embraced the outcries of disagreement from those who think
that Christianity and transhumanism cannot share the same bed. What he has found
is that the majority of the contention comes from individuals who are dissatisﬁed
with how others outside of their Christian religion discredit God; however, he is
quick to note that the goal of Christianity has been to care and heal the sick,
represent the weak, and guide a community to be more holistically positive—all
items that it shares with transhumanism [7]. Perhaps, to play Devil’s advocate, for
those who hold steadfast to the belief that we were created in the image of an
omnipotent, immortal being that is also seen as our eternal Father that they might
consider that the ambitious goals of transhumanism are really humanities’
God-given right. For the short life span that we have in comparison to the eternity
of the cosmos means our growing pains take place over many iterating generations
instead of a few awkward pimpled years.
Pastor Benek is similar that he sees technology as gifts and seeks to utilize them
as tools that Christians can use to better humanity around them. When it comes to
the large-scale adoption of transhumanism as a part of Christianity, there is also
attention raised to the fact that the religion must be relevant to the modern world.
Without a more contemporary approach then religious texts will fall further and
further out of sync with to a world that is simply vastly more complex than could
have been foreseen many millennia ago.
However, it is worth noting that this fervor and passion is not shared by all of
those who share a similar faith base to some of these subsets, an article by Britt
Gillette titled Transhumanism and the Great Rebellion where the author calls the
transhumanist movement the latest incarnation of man’s rebellion against God [8].
Citing multiple psalms the article elaborates on the ways that the transhumanist
movement will create an antichrist, the end times, and see that objective goals of
Transhumanism itself as an affront to God’s own purpose—as perhaps pursuing an
immortal life instead of holding to the faith of an afterlife undermines the original
chosen religion.
This is not the only instance where a religion took a stance against transhu-
manism. The Madrid Declaration on Science and Life was created during the XVIII
International Science and Life Congress, and it speciﬁes and outlines the stance of
members of the church against transhumanism and calls for the creation of an
international court capable of forcing those who experiment with human life
accountable [9]. While, they are correct that we should be thinking of international
standards and policies to ameliorate the sure to be bumpy transition during this time,
what we should not do is limit human capability, and this is more of a sign of uniﬁed
effort to take a stance against transhumanism than a court that will ever be created.
However, despite this, what this declaration did instigate was the kidnapping of
scientist and transhumanist to stand trial before the Vatican, or ‘any country who
29
The Splintering and Controversy of Transhumanism
503

defends human life’, regardless of their country of origin or whether or not their
homeland permits the practice. The targets of this type of policy would be scientist
and transhumanist traveling internationally, whether or not they are actively
engaging in the villainized activities. This extends to those who believe in giving
“rights to animals (natural or artiﬁcial), robots, or new human species artiﬁcially
manipulated” [9]. This means that just like many marginalized groups before them,
such as the homosexuals or transgendered individuals ﬁghting now, so now too will
new forms of humanity and life ﬁght to be recognized as a sentient being with rights
in the eyes of a religion that proposes unconditional, never ending love in the eyes
of their creator.
What is ironic in this outright renunciation of the pursuits of transhumanism
could backﬁre as the future potential that encompasses could prove useful to their
own ends. As one day, as emotionally charged as this may be, our technologies will
become sufﬁciently advanced enough where we isolate the gay gene. At that time,
we would have the potential to engineer the preference of the same gender from the
individual, and the question begs itself to ask: would those of faith who campaign to
restrict this type of advancement fully embrace transhumanistic values should they
beneﬁt their own ends?
As another example, one ﬁlled with far less bigotry, would be if those of these
faiths denouncing transhumanism could embrace it should they be able to geneti-
cally modify children or adults to better serve the clergy, removing certain desires
or testes? Would they provide intervention therapies to current clergy members to
create a lack of sexual desire to protect young children from sexual prowling that
has been occurring within the church, something far more humane than chemical
castration? From 2004 to 2014 alone, there were 3,400 credible cases of sexual
abuse according to the Vatican’s U.N. ambassador [10]—and this is the number of
those who stepped forward. This is absolutely astounding because that is one
innocent child molested every single day at the hands of trusted clergy members for
an entire decade. Not only that, but within one year the Catholic Church within the
United States spent $150,747,387 related to child protection and intervention of
allegations of sexual abuse [10]. Would the Catholic Church approve for tran-
shumanistic ideas if they were not only far more cost effective, but fundamentally
guaranteed the safety of children who interacted with the clergy?
Not as many religions are having resentment to the integrating of this type of
belief. Buddhism is also ﬁnding applicability within transhumanism and offers two
distinct ﬂavorings that differ based on the eastern and western interpretation of
‘Enlightenment’ teachings and applications alongside transhumanism. In western
thought, enlightenment is an emphasis on expanding reasoning, advancement in
knowledge and science, the breaking of religious doctrines, and liberation of the
individual [11]. The eastern interpretation of the Enlightenment concept is the
inseparable connection to the universe and world around you [11]. When Buddhist
fundamental philosophies and Transhumanism ﬁnd themselves into a blender
together we ﬁnd assertions of karma and rebirth resonate strongly in both; both also
emphasize practical philosophy over abstract metaphysics and reduction in suffer-
ing [11].
504
E. Peed

According to the India Future Society, an organization who acts as an advocate
to spread awareness of emerging future technologies (especially within Asia), and
has cutting edge perspectives on the collide of transhumanism and Buddhism; they
note that what transhumanism seems to lack, almost to its beneﬁt, is a set of deeper
and more practical considerations about codes of conduct that are found in many the
other main religions [11]. This almost behooves the outlook because it makes it less
complicated to infuse the belief into another overseeing system—like a major
religion. Another aspect that makes it incredibly easy to merge these two beliefs is
that as opposed to other faiths embracing transhumanism, Buddhism does not have
any reservations about technologies or science to achieve enlightenment [11].
To elucidate this point, religion can be like the eyesight of people. It lets you
understand the world, interpret reality a certain way, molds your behavior, and
enables individuals to interpret forces and actions. Transhumanism can act like a
pair of glasses; we still see with the same eyes, these just help us to stay modern,
sharpen our sight, and engage in our unique period in history. Transhumanism is a
complimentary belief system to many, and its lack of afﬁliation is enabling rapid
adoption outside the normal expectation. By allowing transhumanism, ultimately a
faith in technology, to intertwine with pre-existing spirituality then that belief
system also becomes highly relevant and applicable to the astounding force that is
our exponentially rising pace of innovation.
Mormonism, Christianity, and Buddhism are some of the ﬁrst religions to
experiment with embracing Transhumanism. Catholicism, Judaism, Islam, and
other religious subsets have not embraced or experimented with this cutting-edge
philosophy, or have rejected it. When it comes to who is participating in transhu-
manism, a 2005 pilot study interviewed 430 respondents about their religious
preference and found that there was a 63 % secular or atheistic stance, 24 % were
religious or spiritual, and 14 % contending that their belief was not listed or that
they did not know [12].
In the next few decades, humanity will undergo a large transformation where we
come to question our gender roles, expectations, identities, and deﬁnition of self as
our technology catapults us a few steps from immortal and eternal. We will be
seeing technologies that enable us to extend our lives, immerse us in virtual real-
ities, create cognitive artiﬁcial intelligences, work alongside automated machines
and change as technology inﬁltrates every aspect of our life. These will vary from
seamlessly integrated wearable technologies into our clothing to nanobots that ﬂoat
in our bloodstream repairing damage and cleaning plaque from our arteries.
29.5
Sex and Gender in Transhumanism
It has not been all roses and daisies for transhumanism, some have heralded it as the
world’s most dangerous idea, others have stated that it undermines women’s rights,
men’s right’s, and is blasphemous to many who practice the same religion as
philosophical renegades who apply these contemporary concepts to their beliefs.
29
The Splintering and Controversy of Transhumanism
505

This philosophy has caught both scorn and admiration as those within the same
sector have simultaneously embraced and denied the belief. For others, they have
no idea that this movement is even happening, and other observers say that it is the
strangest liberation movement that has gained momentum that they have ever seen.
Transhumanism is seeking to essentially liberate humanity from itself.
There are some woman, self-declared cyberfeminist, who are attempting to
persuade other women to join their crusade while others who are not completely
satisﬁed with the ‘transhumanist agenda’, and see it as a tool of the patriarchy [13].
This is not an isolated phenomenon, we can also look at those acting as advocates
of men’s rights that are also convinced that transhumanism has its sights set on not
only diminishing male sex drive, but aims at all together wiping the male gender
from the face of the planet—the transhumanist gendercide as extremist have dubbed
it [14].
Fundamentally, we are timid when it comes to change, this is particularly the
case when it comes to sexuality, gender, and the freedom of choice to do as we truly
wish with own body. If we are not limited legislatively then we are limited tech-
nologically. Our understanding of gender and sexual preference is also one area
where humanity will greatly expand. Despite the victories of the recent turn of the
century, there are still massive bigotries present within a society that permeate
themselves to law and the acceptance of LGBT individuals who are often killed,
persecuted, and shamed around the world for attempting to be their true selves. This
desire for freedom for true expression and choice of life is one that those who
support the LGBT community or transhumanism can easily agree upon. As tech-
nologies advance, LGBT and feminism movements may evolve into more clair-
voyant and overseeing conceptual missions for true liberation and freedom like
transhumanism.
This is an important, delicate relationship that is existing with our gender and is
worth mentioning simply due to its relation to postgenderism, which is just one of
the ways that technology is redeﬁning what it means to be a certain gender in each
of the biological, physical, and psychological impacts and how we will one day
transcend it. While there are some who are pushing an almost conspiracy level of
fear into theories like the systematic elimination of gender, sex, or subjugation that
tend to catch like wildﬁre; what transhumanism would seek to change is the ability
to accept or reject a gender. We would no longer be trapped within the conﬁnes of
our own skin; individuals could seek complete fruition and be their own, true
selves.
We could still be men and women if we so choose. We would just be different,
more versatile and accepting in our understanding of gender. One of the more
highly protested concepts in our world is the use of genetic engineering to alter our
future children, which one day might occur. However, one lesser known concept is
ectogenesis, which is the development of embryos in artiﬁcial conditions outside of
a woman’s uterus—normally using artiﬁcial uteruses to create human children. This
is celebrated news, besides aspects of childbirth to be grueling, physically dis-
tressing, and painful; furthermore, it may one day become completely unnecessary.
506
E. Peed

However, let us gain some perspective on birth. According to the World Health
Organization’s website, approximately 830 women die each day from pregnancy
and childbirth, most of which are preventable with 99 % of these deaths occurring
in developing nations, but even in industrialized countries like the United States
mortality rates for women have doubled over the past few decades [15, 16]. This is
a combination of reclassiﬁcation within how deaths are accounted for but is
inclusive to the fact that there has been some increase in death rates in maternal
mortality.
All babies have to come from somewhere, in the case of our future, it might
originate from a medical facility, as sex is one aspect that transhumanism will also
drastically change. We have the implementation of virtual bodies that use teledil-
donics, or hardware based technology capable of replicating sexual interactions
across far distances. This creates more interesting dynamics and in pending decades
we will see a more sexually liberal world appear. This is not to mention the future
world of sexbots and artiﬁcial intelligence partners for those who do not prefer
human interaction.
This democratization of sex and reproductive rights is one that will be at odds
with today current outlook; however, it has some deep beneﬁts for each gender.
First, men and women would be free to celebrate and express their sexuality and
would further liberate women from sexual and reproductive burdens and further
change aspects of gender dynamics. This is important as Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD) is not only for veterans or those who witnessed natural disasters,
those who have faced sexual abuse and trauma are likely to develop PTSD.
According to the conclusions of a large-scale study from the U.S. Ofﬁce of Veteran
Affairs, one in ﬁve women on across several college campuses reported that they
had been raped or molested in their lifetime [17]. Each of those represented women,
whether the trauma occurred as a child or adult, have the high chance of developing
PTSD, which vicious actions like these taken against many young children and
females could be lessened due to the changing of deep seeded gender dynamics
through transhumanism.
However, this is more than simply escaping the burden of birth and the
unshackling of sex; this is contending with why women are twice as likely to suffer
from anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, or why men are more
prone to Attention-Deﬁcit Disorder (ADD), autism, or violence [12]. This is
learning how the mind functions and how we can simulate different experiences.
This is learning how to play the chemicals that make up our complex emotions
within our minds like a ﬁnely tuned ﬁddle, using different compounds to treat
sexual dysfunctions, stimulate trust and desire, and maybe even ﬁnd use in
re-bonding therapies as marriage counseling or in general therapy to help indi-
viduals overcome roadblocks [12]. Perhaps even one day transcending the world of
sex because of the pleasures we can elicit by pleasing our brain could far surpass
any drug, sex, or intoxicant we have currently.

The Splintering and Controversy of Transhumanism
507

29.6
To the Future, and Beyond!
We are on the verge of an era where we will begin to see a more transcendent
thought process arise; the threads of which are weaving their way into the fabric of
our underlying culture. Transhumanism is different from most of the other types of
thought processes because in its pursuit it encompasses many other crusades.
Transhumanism represents a type of philosophy that can be easily intermingled
with others. Transhumanism is seeking to cast its light to illuminate the full
potential of what humanity can become and intertwines itself with our fundamental
changing deﬁnitions of gender, purpose, and expectations of how to live life. This is
just the ﬁrst of many steps; this ideology will evolve further as we embrace a more
globalized consciousness, eventually leading to a cosmological consciousness.
We are at a time in the history of man where we are beginning to realize that Homo
Saipan is just another link in the evolutionary chain that represents humanity. We
have bumbled through our understanding of time and space to uncover the fact that the
world was not made unique for us, that the sun does not revolve around the earth, and
that we are simply one particle of a planet in a spiral galaxy swirling through the inky
blackness of space towards inconceivable inﬁnity. Just as we have adjusted ourselves
to a cosmological perspective, so must we to our grandscale evolutionary one. For
this, we have thought processes like transhumanism to propel us further as we con-
tinually question the limits of our potential and overcome obstacles, as we always
have as a species. Will those who ﬁrst alter themselves see themselves as superior and
attempt to subjugate lesser humans—or will they evolve past this barbaric nature?
Will humans who stay the same perform a pre-emptive strike due to fear? Will we
annihilate future life for the sake of our complacency for where we currently stand?
As a species, we have come a long way from scattered groupings of hunters and
gathers riding in a ﬁeld, who later settled to cultivate that same land, and now we
ﬁnd ourselves in an exciting era as we awaken ourselves in a truly globalizing age,
one our ancestors could hardly of imagined; one where we are coaxed with the
dreams of viewing space through a portside window, have begun to grasp at the
straws of immortality through technology, and question the very deﬁnition of our
underlying human nature.
Whether our future is dystopian or utopian depends on today, the conversations
we have, how we infuse these beliefs into existing systems, and the liberation of
knowledge and technology to take place to actualize the full potential of humanity
and other sentient and intelligent species to come.

Our Hopes and Expectations for the Next
President
Robert Niewiadomski and Dennis Anderson
30.1
Presidential Campaign
You thought the presidential campaign season cannot get any worse, but it has
reached another low point. It simply turned into a reality show. Instead of talking
about huge personalities who are desperately trying to capture our attention, we
should take a moment to go back to fundamentals. If we look beyond the spectacles
of the electoral politics, the following two questions are most important to consider
before heading into the voting booth: What kind of leader would Americans hope
for in this tumultuous time and what are our expectations for the next president?
30.2
Effective Leadership
The notion of effective leadership varied greatly depending on historical, social and
political tradition. It was often tainted by propaganda and political bias. Some great
minds including Plato, Confucius, Machiavelli, Hobbes, and others contributed
substantially to the reﬂections on what it means to be an effective leader. Looking at
the past, we observe that when societies reached certain size and level of com-
plexity, typically an autocratic form of chiefdom emerged. Not surprisingly, this
form of leadership heavily relied on the personal charisma and social position of the
chieftain. Typically, the supreme power was concentrated in the hands of one
person, or an oligarchic circle, whose decision making were not restrained by
contractual instruments. As legal culture increased, this model of governance had

undergone a tremendous transformation in the West. A matured monarchy was
construed as a form of relationship between the sovereign and his/her subjects
governed by a set of rules agreed upon. Nevertheless, in spite the tremendous
advances in liberal, participatory democracy, the style of leadership of one person
continues to have a great inﬂuence on the masses. It exists in a variety of incar-
nations, both in and in non-democratic states and states displaying varying degrees
of democratic features. It is quite a peculiar phenomenon that, as Max Weber
noticed, even in democratic states, the domination of the ruled by the leader is
simply an unavoidable political fact.1
30.3
Styles of Leadership
Theoreticians of leadership identiﬁed few major styles of leadership. Two of them,
authoritarian and paternalistic, have common features with the old idea of kingship.
An authoritarian leader maintains a sharp distinction between the ruler and the ruled
and a strict control over the latter through various instruments, typically through
overregulation aimed at suppression of individualism or anything perceived as
subversion. The paternalistic model, roughly speaking replicates the authoritarian
rule with one important distinction—the father-like leader wins the trust and respect
of his followers (his “children”) by skillful social manipulation sending the message
of care and concern. In addition to the above two, the transactional model utilizes a
simple mechanism of rewards and punishments, typically involving exchange of
labor for rewards. The type of leadership that is of the greater concern for us,
however, is the transformational leadership. It is founded on a genuine concern for
citizens, intellectual stimulation, and a delivery of a common vision.
The nascent form of transformational leadership that emerged at the down of the
United States constituted a paradigmatic shift in the modern history of the West. It
was mostly due to the proliferation of the idea that the true supreme authority lies in
the collective will as oppose to a solitary sovereignty George Washington was
instrumental in setting a precedent during this pivotal moment. He emerged as a
custodian of the common good and a protector of the rules established for the
enhancement of the nation’s well-being. Obviously, this vision never had quite the
kind of clarity as described above. There was some hesitation whether this kind or
leadership will be taken seriously in the Old World. This doubts and struggles were
reﬂected in deliberations regarding the styling and insignia of the future president.
Washington, with his charisma and inﬂuence, could easily inﬂuence the future of
the presidency, and possibly sway it towards a type of quasi-monarchy. He adopted,
however, a model of surprisingly modern and modest statesmanship followed later
by archetypical visionary leaders: Lincoln, FDR, Johnson, and Reagan.

R. Niewiadomski and D. Anderson

Unfortunately, this model was occasionally eroded by pure politicization. Many
of our presidents became alienating and sectarian ﬁgures, chieﬂy concerned with
the interest of their constituencies. The ever-increasing ﬂood of donations, treated
as an expression of freedom of speech, is seriously threatening the model of
visionary leadership. The inﬂux of money puts the reins of governance in the hands
of individuals who can afford to pay for it. In 2014, in a very divisive 5-4-decision,
The Supreme Court struck down the Watergate-era limit on the amount of money
that wealthy donors can contribute to candidates and political committees.2 As a
result, inﬂuential individuals are free to donate as much as they wish to super PACs.
Many legal scholars saw the ruling as a serious distortion of the First Amendment.
As Justice Breyer pointed out in his dissent: “The First Amendment advances not
only the individual’s right to engage in political speech, but also the public’s
interest in preserving a democratic order in which collective speech matters. What
has this to do with corruption? It has everything to do with corruption. Corruption
breaks the constitutionally necessary “chain of communication” between the people
and their representatives. It derails the essential speech-to-government-action tie.
Where enough money calls the tune, the general public will not be heard.”3 He
further argues that “a cynical public can lose interest in political participation
altogether.”4 Large portion of the society on both sides of the political spectrum
realize the danger of opening the money ﬂood gated to super PACs. Thus, it comes
as no surprise that political outsiders who openly challenge this way of campaign
ﬁnancing gained unprecedented popularity.
30.4
Plutocracy
The morphing of democratic institutions into a plutocracy will be one on the
greatest challenges our future leader will need to overcome. What kind of a leader
do we need then? Let us go back to our initial idea of transformational
leadership. What does it really consist of? In essence, it heavily relies on collab-
oration, ﬂexibility, ability to identify the need for change, and, above all, creating a
vision to guide that change through inspiration. An inspirational leader, through his
or her actions and charisma invests the country in that vision and maintains the
commitment of the nation to it.
What does that mean in practical terms, in the current situation we are in? We
need an individual with a vision that offers sound responses to current challenges;
has the courage to be surrender and listen to people that are intelligent and ethical,
even if their qualities exceed greatly those of the leader. We need someone that is

committed to the idea that everyone should have a fair shot to live a fulﬁlling life
and who is an effective advocate for those who are oppressed, weak and powerless.
We need a person resistant to corruption and nepotism; a role model to youth who
can redeﬁne what being an American means in modern times. Moreover, we need a
leader able and willing to apply fact assessment and reason in policy making; open
to compromise whenever judicious and feasible; a person who respects experts,
values science and understands the importance of technology. Finally, we need a
global leader rather than a passive spectator.
The predicaments that we ﬁnd ourselves now in call for certain kind of leader.
The moment is critical and we must understand its urgency. We have reached a
pivotal moment in the human history where the entire planet depends on the
decisions we make and the actions we take now. One of the most important issues
the new leader has to understand is the notion of sustainability and the need for it.
Recently, the United Nations just introduced the sustainable development goals
(SDG) dealing with poverty, hunger, health, environment, etc. In spite of noble
intentions, these targets might remain just ideas on paper without really under-
standing the essence of sustainability and relentless efforts to make it a reality. How
should we understand the proper meaning of sustainability? In essence, sustain-
ability is not about preserving the Earth; it is about ensuring our survival on it.
Naturally, our concern must not be limited to our own species; we need a habitat
that includes animals, plants and the planet itself to survive and thrive.
We should be honest with ourselves and simply admit that in order to survive as
a human race, we must do everything to save the environment we live in for the
sake of us. We are getting used to dying species and trees, massive scale defor-
estation, and billions living in their own waste at the bottom of food chain while
well-to-do people are enjoying hyper consumption.
Sadly, most notable politicians are lacking the vision and the will to tackle the
problem. Less than 10 % of global population consumes too much, produces too
much, buys too much, and eat too much compare to the majority. This is a bad
modus operandi that cannot sustain and eventually will bring everyone down. If we
are looking at the next epic crisis, this is the perfect storm. The world is not
sensitive to our needs—things will be rolling on just the same way they did before
we arrived and they will continue after our departure without anybody to enjoy it, to
explore it, to inquire about it. We are alone responsible for securing our own
survival and the survival of other species we share this planet with. If the future
leader fails to understand and address the issue of sustainability, we are surely
doomed.
30.5
What is Wrong with Current Leaderships
Perhaps, many would wonder what is exactly wrong with current leaderships?
Henry Kissinger formulated the answer to that question a long time ago. It pertained
to a different time and different circumstances, nevertheless, it ﬁts the current
514
R. Niewiadomski and D. Anderson

model: “a talented vote-getter, surrounded by lawyers, who is overly risk-averse.”5
What the current leadership is missing is simply a clear vision how to deal with the
major issues of our time, including the one outlined above. To add even more, our
leadership has fallen again in the trap of protective isolationism and is trading
global leadership for domestic security. Occasional symbolic gestures and
appearances at international meetings are not going to conceal that. Obviously, we
are not advocating for the reversal to the excesses of the Bush era. However, it is
deﬁnitely an illusion that disengagement regarding global issues will bring us
domestic tranquility. In the world that became truly global, this strategy simply
doesn’t work. We would be deceiving ourselves if we do not admit that we can no
longer control our domestic security in addition to other issues without actually
controlling what is happening abroad. If we give up our role as a global leader,
others will swiftly ﬁll in this void we leave for example, global jihadism. The world
simply cannot afford the U. S. becoming more isolated by going back to the Monroe
Doctrine.
30.6
Ideal Leader
What do we expect from the next president during this tumultuous time? A short
answer to the ﬁrst question is—everything that promotes the greatest well-being of
the greatest number. It is a part of our nature to dream, so here is a hefty list of
wishes the next new leader should seriously address to win the election. We want a
leader who can make a genuine effort to create a harmonious society and equal
opportunity for all, lower tax rates, stimulate economic growth that actually gen-
erates sustainable jobs and expansion of the middle class, promote the development
of affordable housing, health care, sustainable social security, quality education,
ensure our energy independence, take actions against hostile groups abroad to keep
us safe at home without engaging in unnecessary wars, make our country com-
petitive again, and ﬁnally—make a very serious and expedient actions to implement
sustainability to save us from ourselves. The new transformational leader we so
desperately need absolutely must have a clear global vision, moral integrity,
charisma and resoluteness to inspire all of us to have the determination as a nation
to realize that vision.

The Transhumanist Platform
and Interview with 2016 U.S. Presidential
Candidate Zoltan Istvan
Newton Lee
31.1
Prologue—WWJD
Despite the separation of church and state in the U.S. Constitution, a Christian
politician facing a conundrum or Gordian knot may ask, “What would Jesus do?” or
WWJD. A transhumanist politician not only relies on a moral compass but also
seeks the best solutions with the help of science and technology in addition to
formal and informal politics.
31.2
Who Are the Transhumanists?
The term “transhumanism” was coined in 1957 by Julian Huxley, the ﬁrst
director-general of the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO). “We’re going to gradually enhance ourselves,” said Ray
Kurzweil, futurist and engineering director at Google. “That’s the nature of being
human—we transcend our limitations” [1]. Pacemakers, prosthesis, stentrode, op-
togenetics, antibiotics, and other medical advancements exemplify the use of tech-
nology to prolong life and to improve quality of life. Even Pope Francis gave his
blessing to human-animal chimera research for organ transplants [2]. Musicians,
artists, and ﬁlmmakers are using computers to advance their storytelling ability. We
are all transhumanists in varying degrees. As such, transhumanism is the most
inclusive ideology for all ethnicities and races, the religious and atheists, conser-
vatives and liberals, young and old.

31.3
Who Are not Transhumanists?
The Amish and elderly Bhutanese people are not transhumanists. The Pennsylvania
Amish of Lancaster County, for instance, has banned the use of public electricity
since 1920 to limit the home use of television, radio, and the Internet. Yet they use
green technology such as solar, hydraulic, and pneumatic power for business and
healthcare centers [3]. Elsewhere, the tiny country of Bhutan surrounded by pristine
forest was the last nation in the world to turn on television in June 1999, but its
people are complaining, “TV is very bad for our country… it controls our minds…
and makes [us] crazy” [4].
31.4
Transhumanism in American Politics
Transhumanism in American politics dated back to 1992 when Dr. Natasha
Vita-More, chairperson of Humanity+ and professor at the University of Advancing
Technology, was elected as a Councilperson for the 28th Senatorial District of Los
Angeles on an openly futurist and transhumanist platform. In 2014, transhumanist
Gabriel Rothblatt ran as a Democratic Party candidate against incumbent
Republican Bill Posey in Florida. In 2016, Zoltan Istvan Gyurko became the ﬁrst
transhumanist to run for the Presidency of the United States. Having read all four
volumes of The Making of the President by Theodore H. White, I had the honor to
be the campaign advisor to Zoltan Istvan for the Transhumanist Party.
31.5
The Transhumanist Platform
Google cofounder Larry Page once broached the question: “Are people really
focused on the right things?” [5]. A transhumanist politician must decipher what
people really care about, see beyond smoke and mirrors, and create a long-term
strategy for the betterment of society and humanity.
Short-sighted policies and populism catering to the lowest common denominator
would only hurt America and the world in the long run. Supercomputer designer
Danny Hillis and American author Steward Brand in 1996 cofounded the Long
Now Foundation to provide “a counterpoint to today’s accelerating culture,” help
make “long-term thinking more common,” and foster “responsibility in the
framework of the next 10,000 years” [6]. In 2014, Sweden’s Prime Minister Stefan
Löfven appointed Kristina Persson to be the Minister of the Future. “If politics
wants to remain relevant and be useful to citizens, it needs to change its approach,”
said Persson in an interview. “Finding solutions needs the cooperation of all of
518
N. Lee

society’s stakeholders. No one [can be] excluded. … Rather than going top-down,
we promote inter-ministerial collaboration and force decision makers to confront
the long-term issues despite the fact this is harder to do sometimes” [7].
31.6
#1 Education—Eliminate the Digital Divide;
Integrate Liberal Arts and Technical Education
Free access to education. We applaud Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton’s col-
lege affordability plan that provides low- and middle-income students free tuition at
in-state public colleges [8]. Even so, some students cannot afford room and board,
or they have day jobs to put food on the table. Free distance education with free
laptops and high-speed Internet will ensure that no one is left behind. MIT professor
Nicholas Negroponte founded One Laptop per Child (OLPC) in 2005 to provide
each child with a rugged, low-cost, low-power, connected laptop [9]. Google is one
of the OLPC founding members. Free Internet and laptop can be subsidized by
commercial ads. Everyone deserves a good education. Eliminating the digital divide
will allow any smart person to create a killer app, solve the P versus NP problem
[10], formulate the Theory of Everything [11], and ﬁnd a cure to cancer and other
diseases—all without formal education. The Internet is the teacher. In September
2011, for example, players of the Foldit video game took less than 10 days to
decipher the AIDS-causing Mason-Pﬁzer monkey virus that had stumped scientists
for 15 years [12].
CS + X. While we support President Obama’s “Computer Science For All”
initiative to empower a generation of American students with the computer science
skills they need to thrive in a digital economy [13], we disagree with Florida
Senate’s bill allowing high school students to count computer coding as a foreign
language course [14]. In the 1987 seminal book The Closing of the American Mind,
philosopher Allan Bloom lamented how “higher education has failed democracy
and impoverished the souls of today’s students” [15]. In 2011, PayPal cofounder
Peter Thiel paid 24 kids $100,000 each to drop out of college to become en-
trepreneurs [16]. What gives? A more well-rounded higher education is necessary
to graduate more ethical hackers and fewer cybercriminals, more socially respon-
sible leaders and fewer wolves of Wall Street. Stanford University, for example, has
created a CS + X degree program that integrates computer science and the
humanities [17].
Interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving. Google’s life science sub-
sidiary—Verily—has a staff philosopher among its 350 scientists. Its CEO Andy
Conrad explained, “We have to understand the ‘why’ of what people do.
A philosopher might be as important as a chemist” [18]. And actor Robin Williams
lectured his students in Dead Poets Society: “We read and write poetry because we
are members of the human race. And the human race is ﬁlled with passion. And
medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to
31
The Transhumanist Platform and Interview …
519

sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for”
[19]. Higher education should encourage students to become Renaissance men and
women—polymaths who can apply an interdisciplinary approach to problem
solving.
31.7
#2 Healthcare—Eradicate Diseases; Improve Quality
of Life
The TIME Magazine cover on September 30, 2013 reads “Can Google Solve
Death? The search giant is launching a venture to extend the human life span. That
would be crazy—if it weren’t Google” [20]. Many scientists avoid being labeled
transhumanists, but they share the same objective of transhumanism in healthcare.
In a 2015 interview by the 2045 Strategic Social Initiative, TV anchor Olesya
Yermakova asked SENS (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence)
Research Foundation cofounder Aubrey de Grey, “Do you consider yourself a
transhumanist?” And de Grey replied. “Not really. No. I really just consider myself
a completely boring medical researcher. I just want to stop people from getting
sick” [21].
Superbugs—bacteria that are resistant to all antibiotics including the last-resort
nephrotoxic drug Colistin—have infected humans and animals in the United States
and more than 20 countries worldwide. Review on Antimicrobial Resistance issued
a report which projects that by 2050, more than 10 million people will die from
superbugs each year, outpacing cancer (8.2 million), diabetes (1.5 million), diar-
rheal disease (1.4 million), and other illnesses [22].
In 2015, the U.S. government spent 28.7 % of taxpayer’s money on health
programs [23]. The second largest spending was 25.4 % on the Pentagon and the
military while education received a meager 3.6 %. Despite government subsidies,
out-of-pocket prescription-drug costs rose 2.7 % in 2014 [24] and continued to rise
moderately under Obamacare in 2015 [25].
Transhumanists focus their R&D efforts on affordable and accessible medical
treatments for all. A healthy population is vital to a country’s economy and national
security. Eradicating diseases and improving quality of life for all human beings are
near the top of the agenda of the Transhumanist Party.
31.8
#3 Employment—Let Robots Do the Work; Start
Living Your Dreams
If Apple’s smartphones were assembled in USA instead of China, a $600 iPhone 6s
would cost more than doubled at around $1300 [26]. You can’t have your cake and
eat it too. The fact is that Americans do not want the low-paying assembly line jobs
back, knowing that such jobs will eventually be replaced by robots.
520
N. Lee

Given the chance to let machines do the job, Google cofounder Larry Page
estimated that nine out of 10 people “wouldn’t want to be doing what they’re doing
today” [27]. The remaining 10 % really love their jobs and make no distinction
between working and playing. For example, scientists tinker with computers,
architects toy with structures, musicians ﬁddle with notes, poets play with words,
and mathematicians amuse themselves with numbers and patterns.
Inspired by IBM Watson on Jeopardy!, futurist Martin Ford penned a piece in
The Atlantic with the sensational title “Anything You Can Do, Robots Can Do
Better” and he asked the question “Is any job safe from automation?” [28] The
answer is an unequivocal “no.” In 2015, Google, Adobe, and MIT researchers at the
Computer
Science
and
Artiﬁcial
Intelligence
Laboratory
(CSAIL)
created
“Helium”—a computer program that modiﬁes code faster and better than expert
computer engineers for complex software such as Photoshop [29]. What takes
human coders months to program, Helium can do the same job in a matter of hours
or even minutes.
One may worry that if robots do all the work, humans would have nothing to do
and be bored as vividly depicted in Zager and Evans’ song “In the Year 2525.” Not
true.
First of all, human-based computation (HBC) allows machines to outsource
certain tasks to humans to tackle. Human-machine symbiosis is the workforce of the
future. American psychologist and computer scientist J.C.R. Licklider predicted in
1960 that “human brains and computing machines will be coupled together very
tightly, and that the resulting partnership will think as no human brain has ever
thought and process data in a way not approached by the information-handling
machines we know today” [30].
Secondly, as robots are taking over the mundane jobs, people will be free to
follow their yellow brick roads. In early 2016, bucketlist.org showcased more than
4 million life goals from over 300,000 members [31]. Challenge yourself—invent a
new musical instrument, write a novel, climb Mount Everest, adopt an orphan, and
start living your dreams—not just yours, but your families’ and friends’ as well. In
his 2007 Last Lecture titled “Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams,” Prof.
Randy Pausch told the captive audience at Carnegie Mellon University, “It’s a thrill
to fulﬁll your own childhood dreams, but as you get older, you may ﬁnd that
enabling the dreams of others is even more fun” [32].
Fulﬁlling one’s dreams will result in true innovations which will in turns give
birth to new businesses and new jobs. In a 2001 interview by BusinessWeek, Larry
Page told technology reporter Olga Kharif, “I think part of the reason we’re suc-
cessful so far is that originally we didn’t really want to start a business. We were
doing research at Stanford University. Google sort of came out of that” [33].

#4 Public Safety—Improve Guns, Infrastructure,
Law and Order
Gun control. Guns are not the problems, people are. Gun control would not have
stopped the terrorist who used a truck to mow down 84 people in the Riviera city of
Nice in July 2016 [34], nor would it have stopped a deranged man who barged into
a kindergarten and stabbed 31 schoolchildren and teachers in the Jiangsu province
of China in March 2010 [35].
Nonetheless, guns are inherently dangerous and they are in more than one third
of all U.S. households [36]. In 2015, there were 279 incidents of American children
unintentionally killed or injured someone with a gun [37]. Some of the 990 people
(including 494 white and 258 black) shot dead by police in 2015 were innocent
[38].
In addition to doing a better job of educating the public about gun safety and
improving police training, a transhumanist solution is to accelerate the research and
development of smart guns and non-lethal weapons. A smart gun can only be ﬁred
when activated by the gun owner whereas non-lethal weapons are designed to
subdue a person without causing serious injuries and death.
America’s infrastructure. American Society of Civil Engineers gave America’s
infrastructure a low grade of D+ [39]. Nearly 60,000 bridges across the U.S. are in
desperate need of repair. “It’s just eroding and concrete is falling off,” said National
Park Service spokeswoman Jenny Anzelmo-Sarles, referring to the Arlington
Memorial Bridge crossed by 68,000 vehicles every day [40]. The Texas Tribune
reported that the nation’s largest reﬁning and petrochemical complex in Houston—
where billions of gallons of oil and dangerous chemicals are stored—is a “sitting
duck for the next big hurricane” [41]. Gas Pipe Safety Foundation cofounder
Kimberly Archie called the aging natural gas infrastructure in American cities a
“ticking time bomb” [42].
Transhumanists would invest in better infrastructure that can withstand hurri-
cane, earthquakes, and natural or manmade disasters. Google/Alphabet’s Sidewalk
Labs, for instance, focuses on urban design by pursuing technologies to “cut pol-
lution, curb energy use, streamline transportation, and reduce the cost of city living”
[43].
Law and order. During my meeting with the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) on November 27, 2015, an FBI agent remarked that the law enforcement
agency was underfunded and understaffed. Meanwhile, the U.S. spent more than
$590 billion in military operations around the world in 2015 [44]. The American
public will be better served if we double the police force and halve the military
spending. Bring home half of the American troops presently overseas and reassign
them to the FBI, local police force, and counterterrorism units.
A natural extension of military surveillance drones, robots more advanced than
Boston Dynamics’ next generation Atlas [45] will be sent to war zones and
peace-keeping forces to protect human lives, prevent friendly ﬁre, and conduct
search and rescue operations. On the home front, autonomous security robots have
522
N. Lee

already been deployed at public venues such as Stanford Shopping Center in
California [46] and a police robot was used to neutralize a Dallas shooting suspect
who murdered ﬁve police ofﬁcers [47]. In time, robots will be more versatile and
ubiquitous.

#5 World Peace and Prosperity—Apply Quantum
Computer Simulations
In August 2014, Facebook asked thousands of its users in their own language: “Do
you think we will achieve world peace within 50 years?” A minuscule 5.41 % of U.
S. respondents believed that world peace was possible [48].
World peace is in the best interests of every nation on earth. However, a lasting
peace cannot be achieved by force. As M said in the 2015 James Bond movie
Spectre, “All the surveillance in the world can’t tell you what to do next. A license
to kill is also a license not to kill.” America can exert its inﬂuence globally without
resorting to war [49].
Protectionism is not an option in today’s global economy. In 2016, out of the
$12.9 trillion dollars U.S. debt, China owns $1.3 trillion, Japan $1.1 trillion, and
other countries $3.8 trillion [50]. In other words, foreign nations hold 32.5 % of the
total U.S. treasury bonds. Moreover, in 2016, as much as 75 % of American real
estate in New York City is owned by foreigners, many of whom do not even reside
in the United States.
Nationalism should not outweigh international cooperation. Global warming has
been causing extreme weather, increased drought, rising sea levels, and extinction
of some animal species. Transhumanists around the world are cooperating to mit-
igate existential threats to humankind.
We do not have all the answers today, but we can ﬁnd them with the help of
computer simulations. Classical computers have their inherent limitations because
the world is not black and white, ones and zeros. However, quantum computers will
enable us to create more accurate simulation programs and decision-support sys-
tems for scientists and policymakers. Hartmut Neven, director of engineering at
Google’s Quantum Artiﬁcial Intelligence Laboratory, explained, “Classical system
can only give you one route out. You have to walk up over the next ridge and peak
behind it, while quantum mechanisms give you another escape route, by going
through the ridge, going through the barrier” [51]. Krysta Svore at Microsoft
Research expressed her high hopes, “With a quantum computer, we hope to ﬁnd a
more efﬁcient way to produce artiﬁcial fertilizer, having direct impact on food
production around the world, and we hope to combat global warming by learning
how to efﬁciently extract carbon dioxide from the environment. Quantum com-
puters promise to truly transform our world” [52].

An Interview with 2016 U.S. Presidential Candidate
Zoltan Istvan
In 2016, Zoltan Istvan Gyurko became the ﬁrst transhumanist to run for the
Presidency of the United States, aiming to put science, health, and technology at the
forefront of American politics. The following is the transcript of an interview with
Zoltan Istvan:
Q: Who are the transhumanists?
A: Transhumanists are curiosity addicts. If it’s new, different, untouched, or even
despised, we’re probably interested in it. If it involves a revolution or a possible
paradigm shift in human experience—you have our full attention. We are obsessed
with the mysteries of existence, and we spend our time exploring anything we can
ﬁnd about the evolving universe and our tiny place in it.
Obsessive curiosity is a strange bedfellow. It stems from a profound sense of
wanting something better in life—of not being satisﬁed. It makes one search,
ponder, and strive for just about everything and anything that might improve
existence. In the 21st century—especially if you’re an atheist like me—it also leads
one right into transhumanism. That’s where I’ve landed right now: the 2016 US
Presidential candidate of the Transhumanist Party, a new science-themed political
organization that aims to give everyone the opportunity to live forever in perfect
health [53].
Q: What is transhumanism?
A: Transhumanism is the international movement of using science and technology
to radically change the human being and experience. Its primary goal is to deliver
and embrace a utopian techno-optimistic world—a world that consists of bio-
hackers,
cyborgists,
roboticists,
life
extension
advocates,
cryonicists,
Singularitarians, and other science-devoted people. Transhumanism was formally
started in 1980s by philosophers in California. For decades it remained low key,
mostly discussed in science ﬁction novels and unknown academic conferences.
Lately, however, transhumanism seems to be surging in popularity [54]. What once
was a smallish band of fringe people discussing how science and technology can
solve all humanity’s problems has now become a burgeoning social mission of
millions around the planet. Since I founded the Transhumanist Party in October
2014, there are already nearly 26 other national transhumanist parties around the
globe, spanning ﬁve of the seven continents.
Q: Why are so many people jumping on this bandwagon?
A: To me, the reason is plain to see. It has to do with the mishmash of tech
inundating and dominating our daily lives. Everything from our smartphone
addictions to ﬂying at 30,000 ft in jet airplanes to Rumbas freaking out our pets in
our homes. Nothing is like it was for our forbearers. In fact, little is like it was even
a generation ago. And the near future will be many times more dramatic: driverless
cars, robotic hearts [55], virtual reality sex, and telepathy via mindreading headsets.
524
N. Lee

Each of these technologies is already here, getting ready to be marketed to billions.
The world is shifting under our feet.
Q: How did you become a transhumanist?
A: My interest in transhumanism began over 20 years ago when I was a philosophy
and religion student at Columbia University in New York City. We were assigned
to read an article on life extension techniques and the strange ﬁeld of cryonics
where human beings are frozen after they’ve died in hopes of reviving them with
better medicine in the future. While I’d read about these ideas in science ﬁction
before, I didn’t realize an entire cottage industry and movement dedicated to trying
to ward off death with radical science already existed in America. It was an epi-
phany for me, and I knew after ﬁnishing that article I was passionately committed to
transhumanism and wanted to help it.
However, it wasn’t until I was in the Demilitarized Zone of Vietnam, on
assignment for National Geographic Channel as a journalist [56], that I came to
dedicate my life to transhumanism. Walking in the jungle, my guide tackled me and
I fell to the ground with my camera. A moment later he pointed at the half hidden
landmine I almost stepped on. I’d been through dozens of dangerous experiences in
over 100 countries I visited in during my 20s and early 30s—hunting down wildlife
poachers with WildAid, volcano boarding in the South Paciﬁc [57], and even facing
a pirate attack off Yemen on my small sailboat where I hid my girlfriend in the bilge
and begged masked men with AK47s not to shoot me—but this experience in
Vietnam was the one that forced a u-turn in my life. Looking at the unexploded
landmine, I felt like a philosophical explosive had gone off in my head. It was time
to directly dedicate my skills and hours to overcoming biological human death.
I returned home to America immediately and plunged into the ﬁeld of tran-
shumanism, reading everything I could on the topic, talking with people about it,
and preparing a plan to contribute to the movement. I also began by writing my
novel The Transhumanist Wager [58], which went on to become a bestseller in
philosophy on Amazon and helped launch my career as a futurist. Of course, a
bestseller in philosophy on Amazon doesn’t mean very many sales, but it did mean
that transhumanism was starting to appear alongside the ideas of Plato, Marx,
Nietzsche, Ayn Rand, Sam Harris, and other philosophers that inspired people to
look outside their scope of experience into the unknown.
Q: What are the challenges facing transhumanism?
A: Transhumanism is the unknown. Bionic arms, brain implants, ectogenesis [59],
artiﬁcial intelligence, exoskeleton suits, designer babies. These technologies are no
longer part of some Star Trek sequel, but are already here or being worked on. They
will change the world and how we see ourselves as human beings. The conundrum
facing society is whether we’re ready for this. Transhumanism and my political
party say yes. But America—with it’s roughly 75 % Christian population
[60]—may not welcome that.

In fact, the civil rights battle of the century may be looming because of coming
transhumanist tech. If conservatives think abortion rights are unethical, how will
they feel about scientists who want to genetically combine the best aspects of
species, including humans and animals together? And should people be able to
marry their sexbots? Will Christians try to convert artiﬁcial intelligence and lead us
to a Jesus Singularity [61]? Should we allow scientists to reverse aging, something
researchers have already had success with in mice? Finally, as we become more
cyborg-like with artiﬁcial hips, cranial implants, and 3D-printed organs [62], should
we rename the human species?
Q: Has transhumanism already arrived?
A: Whether people like it or not (and many conservatives and religious-minded
people don’t), transhumanism has arrived. Not only has it become a leading buz-
zword for a new generation pondering the signiﬁcance of merging with machines
[63], but transhumanist-themed columns are appearing in major media [64],
celebrity conspiracy theorists like Mark Dice and Alex Jones bash it regularly, and
even mainstream media heavyweights like John Stossel, Joe Rogan, and Glenn
Beck discuss it publicly. Then there’s Google hiring famed inventor Ray Kurzweil
as lead engineer to work on artiﬁcial intelligence, or J. Craig Venter’s new San
Diego-based genome sequencing start-up (co-founded with Peter Diamandis of the
XPRIZE Foundation and stem cell pioneer Robert Hariri) which already has
70 million dollars in ﬁnancing [65].
It’s not just companies either. Recently, the British Parliament approved a pro-
cedure to create babies with material from three different parents. Even Obama has
recently jumped in the game by giving DARPA $70 million dollars to develop brain
chip technology, part of America’s multi-billion dollar BRAIN Initiative [66]. The
future is coming fast, people around the world are realizing, and there’s no denying
that the transhumanist age fascinates tens of millions of people as they wonder where
the species might go and what health beneﬁts it might mean for society.
Q: What is the main focus of transhumanism?
A: In the end of the day, transhumanism, like myself, is still really focused on one
thing: satisfying that essential addiction to curiosity. With science and technology
as our tools, the species can seek out and even challenge the very nature of its being
and place in the universe. That will almost certainly mean the end of human death
by mid-century if governments allow the science and medicine to develop. It will
likely mean the transformation of the species from biological entities into some-
thing with much more tech built directly into it. Perhaps most important of all, it
will mean we will have the chance to grow and evolve with our families, friends,
and loved ones for as long as we like, regardless how weird or wild transhumanist
existence becomes.

Epilogue—The Tower of Babel
Some people accuse transhumanists of playing God and building the Tower of
Babel. Well, except for faith healers, everyone has accepted that doctors are playing
God in saving patients’ lives. Transhumanists are like doctors from all walks of life
in a diversity of subject matters. Albert Einstein wrote in his autobiography that
“All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree. All these aspirations
are directed toward ennobling man’s life, lifting it from the sphere of mere physical
existence and leading the individual towards freedom” [67].
Transhumanists are building the Tower of Babel not to challenge God but to better
understand the universe and human beings created in God’s image. Marc Goodman,
global security advisor and futurist, spoke at the TEDGlobal 2012 in Edinburgh
about his ominous warning: “If you control the code, you control the world. This is
the future that awaits us” [68]. First source code, then genetic code. Transhumanists
are well aware of that danger and are highly respectful of individual freedom and
privacy in the new era of total information awareness. “The future is ours to shape,”
said Max Tegmark, MIT cosmologist and cofounder of the Future of Life Institute. “I
feel we are in a race that we need to win. It’s a race between the growing power of the
technology and the growing wisdom we need to manage it” [69].
Some people believe that the transhumanist goals are impossible to achieve.
Difﬁcult? Yes. Unattainable? No. Matthew 17:20 tells the story that one day the
disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, “Why couldn’t we drive it [the demon]
out?” And Jesus replied, “Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you
have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from
here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.”
Given that the ﬁrst manned Moon landing only had a 50 % chance of landing
safely on the moon’s surface, it was an exemplary faith in technology and the
human spirit. American astronaut Neil Armstrong said in a video interview to the
Certiﬁed Practicing Accountants of Australia, “I thought we had a 90 % chance of
getting back safely to Earth on that ﬂight but only a 50–50 chance of making a
landing on that ﬁrst attempt. There are so many unknowns on that descent from
lunar orbit down to the surface that had not been demonstrated yet by testing and
there was a big chance that there was something in there we didn’t understand
properly and we had to abort and come back to Earth without landing” [70].
Let’s not give up on faith and the human spirit in accomplishing the impossible
—world peace, universal rights, and human longevity to name a few.
